It is a novel, gene-specific assay that amplifies nucleic acid with high specificity, sensitivity and rapidity under isothermal conditions using a set of six specially designed primers that recognize eight distinct sequences of the target gene. This method works with even low copies of DNA and is based on magnesium pyrophosphate turbidity detection by an inexpensive photometer for quantitative analysis. A user-friendly protocol was developed with optimal conditions standardized at 63 \u2022 C for 60 min. With this protocol, the assay sensitivity was 10 times higher than the widely used YHV nested RT-PCR system. Cross-reactivity analysis using other shrimp virus DNA/cDNA and YHV-negative shrimp demonstrated high specificity of the assay. The real-time RT-LAMP method was performed also for an internal control gene, EF-1\u2423, to compare with the expressions of the YHV gene in different organs of infected shrimp, and the resulting standard curves showed high correlation coefficient values. These results suggest that this assay is applicable widely as a new quantitative detection method in the pursuit of YHV-free shrimp culture.",

            "text": "Yellow head virus (YHV) is a highly virulent shrimp pathogen which causes extensive mortalities in farmed penaeid shrimp. YHV was first reported as a virulent pathogen in the early 1990s causing a 100% crop loss within 3-5 days post-infection in Penaeus monodon in Thailand (Limsuwan, 1991; Chantanachookin et al., 1993) . Since then, several researchers have reported the occurrence of YHV in farmed and wild shrimp in Taiwan (Wang and Chang, 2000) and many other Asian countries (Walker et al., 2001) . The causative agent is a rod-shaped, enveloped virus with positive stranded ssRNA containing four open reading frames and is classified under the genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae (Walker et al., 2005) . So far, six genotypes have been identified, and only genotype 1 is known to cause typical signs of YHV infection in shrimp (OIE, 2006) . Other genotypes have been found widespread in P. monodon shrimp populations throughout the Indo-Pacific region but not associated with farm disease outbreaks (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008a) . Conventional diagnostic measures such as gross signs and histopathology have been used to measure the severity of YHV infection (OIE, 2006; Flegel, 2007) , though typical signs are not always observed and histopathology observations are not definitive (Tang et al., 2002) . Various nucleic acid and antibody based diagnostic methods have been developed to demonstrate YHV infection in shrimps (Soowannayan et al., 2003; Cowley et al., 2004; Mekata et al., 2006; Munro and Owens, 2006; Intorasoot et al., 2007; Sithigorngul et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "The LAMP assay is a novel approach to nucleic acid amplification that amplifies DNA with high specificity, selectivity and rapidity under isothermal conditions thereby obviating the need for a thermal cycler. The LAMP assay is based on the principle of autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis (Notomi et al., 2000) . The reaction is performed by DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and two sets of specially designed inner and outer primers. This assay is highly specific for the target sequence, because the target sequence is recognized at six independent sequences in the initial stage and at four independent sequences during the later stages of the LAMP reaction. In this study, additional two primers (Loop F and Loop B) were designed to accelerate the LAMP reaction where the combined primer set facilitates strand displacement. Loop primers bond with the stem-loops, excluding the prime strand displacement DNA synthesis and inner primer bound area (Mori et al., 2001; Nagamine et al., 2002) . The LAMP method has been used without quantitation for diagnosis of various shrimp viruses such as white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) (Kono et al., 2004) , YHV (Mekata et al., 2006) , MrNV and XSV (Pillai et al., 2006) , infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) (Sun et al., 2006) and taura syndrome virus (TSV) (Kiatpathomchai et al., 2007) . These qualitative methods, however, cannot determine the copy number of the viral particles present in the sample.",

            "text": "Recently, real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (real-time LAMP) was developed to amplify nucleic acids with high specificity and sensitivity, allowing quantitative analysis of nucleic acid templates (Notomi et al., 2000) . During the LAMP reaction, an insoluble by-product, magnesium pyrophosphate, is produced in proportion to the amounts of the target DNA to be amplified. Therefore, real-time quantitation can be achieved by measuring the turbidity caused by magnesium pyrophosphate using an inexpensive photometer (Mori et al., 2001) . Real-time LAMP assay has been used for many non-shrimp viruses such as West Nile virus (Parida et al., 2004) , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (Poon et al., 2005) , Dengue virus (Parida et al., 2005) and hepatitis A virus (Yoneyama et al., 2007) . In viral diseases of shrimp, the real-time LAMP method has been employed for white spot disease virus (Mekata et al., 2009 ) and IHHNV (Sudhakaran et al., 2008) . In order to improve the epidemiological status of YHV, it has become even more important to have a rapid and applicable method for detection of the virus. In the present study, a comparatively less expensive quantitative real-time RT-LAMP assay was successfully applied for detection of YHV in the field and proven to have high sensitivity and specificity.",

Although there is a strong demand for development of a rapid and simple detection for all genotypes of YHV, the real-time RT-LAMP assay has been targeted to the most dominant genotype, which affects the shrimp culture worldwide (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008a) . This report demonstrates a one-step, single tube, real-time accelerated RT-LAMP assay for rapid detection of YHV. Real-time RT-PCR assays have been developed for laboratory diagnosis of shrimp viruses (Poulos et al., 2008; Xie et al., 2008; Dhar et al., 2009) ; however, these techniques have the intrinsic disadvantage of requiring either a high-precision instrument for the amplification or a complex method for the detection of amplified products. The sensitive real-time RT-LAMP assay has been successfully applied to detect many human pathogenic RNA viruses, resulting in rapid and simple diagnostic measures (Parida et al., 2004; Imai et al., 2006; Shirato et al., 2007) .",

The loop primers were used to accelerate the reaction to reduce the detection time (Yoneyama et al., 2007) . The optimal condition for YHV real-time RT-LAMP assay was 63 \u2022 C with a reaction time of 60 min. Sensitivity and specificity analyses confirmed the efficiency of primer regions selected for YHV detection by real-time RT-LAMP. The developed method is specific to YHV and does not show any cross-reaction with DNA/cDNA of other shrimp disease viruses or normal shrimp DNA. Although the RT-LAMP assay for YHV (Mekata et al., 2006) has been found to be less sensitive than the nested RT-PCR detection method (IQ2000), real-time RT-LAMP is highly sensitive compared to those methods demonstrated earlier. In the present study, the YHV-positive RNA template was detectable up to a 10 \u22125 dilution by real-time RT-LAMP; this sensitivity is 10 times higher than the result by nested RT-PCR. Higher sensitivity of the real-time LAMP assay was accelerated by employing the loop primers (Nagamine et al., 2002) .",

Proportionally to the number of amplicons generated, the real-time RT-LAMP reaction yields a large amount of by-products, pyrophosphate ion, leading to the accumulation of white magnesium pyrophosphate precipitates in the reaction mixture. Hence, increase in turbidity of the reaction mixture correlates with the amount of DNA synthesized, and the turbidity is visible to the naked eye and measured by a real-time turbidimeter (Mori et al., 2001) . Moreover, it is more cost effective when compared to real-time PCR, which usually requires expensive equipment as well as an expensive fluorescence probe to ensure the specificity of the reaction (Mori et al., 2004) .",

High correlation coefficient values were obtained in YHV and internal control gene, EF-1\u2423 (r 2 = 0.9869 and 0.9729, respectively). These results indicate that quantitative mRNA expression analysis of the YHV replicase polyprotein gene in different organs from YHV-infected shrimp can be reliably used even when the expression of the target gene is low.

Relative expression of YHV replicase polyprotein gene normalized with the expression of the internal control gene, EF-1\u2423, in different organs of YHV-infected shrimp, P. monodon. The data obtained from the real-time RT-LAMP analysis were subjected to one-way analysis of variance followed by an unpaired, two-tailed t-test. *Indicates a significant difference (P < 0.01). sion level of the YHV gene in the heart suggests the importance of selection of the organ for detecting YHV in shrimp. This is the first quantitative real-time RT-LAMP assay described for YHV detection in shrimp with the highest sensitivity and specificity achieved within a short duration of reaction time. This assay will provide a practical tool in the field for quantitative detection of YHV infection in cultured shrimp, even at the early stages. A recent outbreak of YHV in the Asia-Pacific and other regions has led to severe economic loss to shrimp farmers (Cowley and Walker, 2002) because there was no user-friendly detection assay available. The YHV real-time RT-LAMP assay would be a promising technology for YHV detection, which contributes to better shrimp health management and disease surveillance in shrimp hatcheries and culture ponds for prevention of disease outbreak.",
