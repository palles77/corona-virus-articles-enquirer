            "text": "Background: The role of IL-27 in the pathogenesis of airway infl ammatory diseases remains elusive. We, therefore, have studied its concentrations in the sputum and plasma of patients with COPD and patients with pulmonary TB (PTB), and further investigated the mechanism-of-action effects of IL-27 on bronchial epithelial cells in vitro . Methods: Human bronchial epithelial cells grown on air-liquid interface culture were activated by IL-27, alone, or in combination with other infl ammatory cytokines in the presence or absence of various signaling molecule inhibitors. The expression of CXCL10 was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The underlying signaling pathways were studied by intracellular staining using fl ow cytometry, Western blot, ELISA, or siRNA. Results: Signifi cantly higher sputum and plasma concentrations of IL-27 were found in patients with COPD (n 5 34; P , .01 and P , .001, respectively) or patients with PTB (n 5 31; P , .01 and P , .001, respectively) than in healthy control subjects (n 5 48). Sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 levels in patients with COPD correlated negatively with FEV 1 ( r 5 2 0.51, P , .01). Sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 in patients with PTB correlated positively with mycobacterial load in sputum ( r 5 0.48, P , .05). Further in vitro studies demonstrated that IL-27 could induce gene and protein expression of CXCL10 in bronchial epithelial cells, which was regulated by the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway. Conclusions: The production of IL-27 is related to the pathogenesis of COPD and PTB, and IL-27 induces the expression of CXCL10 in bronchial epithelial cells through the activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

[3] [4] [5] IL-27 is a pleiotropic cytokine consisting of EBI3 and p28 subunits. 6 It is an early product of activated antigen-presenting cells stimulated by toll-like receptor ligands or infectious agents. [7] [8] [9] IL-27 could drive the differentiation of the T helper (Th) cell type 1 (Th1) subset in the early stage of development, [6] [7] [8] and support germinal center function by enhancing IL-21 production and the function of follicular Th cells. 10 IL-27 is able to stimulate monocytes, mast cells, and keratinocytes to produce a variety of proinfl ammatory cytokines. 9, 11 In addition, IL-27 exhibits antitumor activity by promoting effector responses of CD8 1 T cells and natural killer cells. 12, 13 On the other hand, IL-27 plays an immunoregulatory role in suppressing the development of the Th1, Th2, and (approval No. 20080156) , and informed consent was obtained from all participants according to the Declaration of Helsinki.",

However, its immunopathologic role in airway infl ammation and its relationship to airway infl ammatory diseases have not yet been elucidated.

[19] [20] [21] Following previous studies and toxicity threshold values from the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, we selected the optimal concentrations of Janus kinase inhibitor AG490 (5 m M), NF-k B inhibitor BAY11-7082 (0.8 m M), PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 m M), extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor U0126 (10 m M), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB203580 (20 m M), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 (5 m M) with signifi cant inhibitory effects but without any cell toxicity. As shown in Figure 4A , LY294002 could signifi cantly suppress IL-27-induced CXCL10 production in PBEC, whereas treatment with AG490, BAY11-7082, SB203580, SP600125, and U0126 did not affect CXCL10 release.",

As shown in Figure 4B , LY294002 (1 m M) could also signifi cantly downregulate IL-27-induced CXCL10 production. Even at the concentration of 0.5 m M of LY294002, IL-27induced CXCL10 production was reduced, although it did not reach statistical signifi cance. However, selective inhibition of PI3K p110 g by AS604850 or PI3K p110 d by IC87114 had no effect on IL-27stimulated CXCL10 release ( Fig 4B ) . enhance the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on the surface of bronchial epithelial cells, 19 we took bronchial epithelial cells as an in vitro cell model to study the potential role of IL-27 in the induction of cytokine and chemokine in bronchial epithelial cells. We found that IL-27 was able to induce the expression of CXCL10 but not IL-6, TNF-a , or CXCL8, which is consistent with previous reports that IL-27 could stimulate the production of CXCL10 in monocytes, keratinocytes, and fi broblast-like synoviocytes. 9, 22, 23 In fact, CXCL10 is a pivotal chemokine that contributes to both Th1-and Th2-type airway infl ammation, 24,25 and a signifi cantly increased production of CXCL10 has been seen in airway infl ammatory diseases such as COPD, PTB, chronic bronchitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome. [26] [27] [28] [29] In this study, we found that IL-27 is a novel inducer of healthy control subjects. In addition, sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 concentrations in COPD showed a significant correlation with FEV 1 , suggesting a possible link to disease severity. However, sputum IL-27 was not correlated with residual volume/total lung capacity, indicating that IL-27 may not be associated with alveolar wall destruction in COPD. In addition, sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 was correlated with mycobacterial load in sputum in patients with PTB, suggesting that IL-27 in sputum may refl ect the intensity of TB infection. Additional COPD and PTB patients are currently being recruited to further evaluate the sputum and plasma conversion of IL-27 and the response to antiinfl ammation therapies.",

Furthermore, both PI3K p110 a and PI3K p110 b isoforms were important for IL-27induced CXCL10 expression, whereas PI3K p110 g and PI3K p110 d had little effect. These results are reasonable because PI3K p110 a and PI3K p110 b are widely distributed, whereas PI3K p110 g and PI3K p110 d are enriched only in leukocytes. [32] [33] [34] However, inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway could partially suppress the expression of CXCL10 induced by IL-27 in bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting that other unidentifi ed signaling pathways might contribute to CXCL10 expression.",

We demonstrated that IL-27 could augment CXCL10 production from bronchial epithelial cells in combination with other infl ammatory cytokines, including IFN-g , IL-1 b , TNF-a , and IL-17F. However, IL-4, IL-13, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23 could not activate bronchial epithelial cells to produce CXCL10. This may be because the stimulation of bronchial epithelial cells by these cytokines could not provide an integrated response by activating CXCL10 gene transcription and protein translation via transcription factors, chromatin phosphorylation, and increasing nucleotide synthesis.
