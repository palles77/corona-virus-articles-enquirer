            "text": "The occurrence of clathrin-coated buds on immature granules (IGs) of the regulated secretory pathway suggests that specific transmembrane proteins are sorted into these buds through interaction with cytosolic adaptor proteins. By quantitative immunoelectron microscopy of rat endocrine pancreatic \u2424 cells and exocrine parotid and pancreatic cells, we show for the first time that the mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) for lysosomal enzyme sorting colocalize with the AP-1 adaptor in clathrin-coated buds on IGs. Furthermore, the concentrations of both MPR and AP-1 decline by \u202b\u0641\u202c 90% as the granules mature. Concomitantly, in exocrine secretory cells lysosomal proenzymes enter and then are sorted out of IGs, just as was previously observed in \u2424 cells (Kuliawat, R., J. Klumperman, T. Ludwig, and P. Arvan. 1997. J. Cell Biol. 137:595-608). The exit of MPRs in AP-1/clathrincoated buds is selective, indicated by the fact that the membrane protein phogrin is not removed from maturing granules. We have also made the first observation of a soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor, syntaxin 6, which has been implicated in clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking from the TGN to endosomes (Bock, J.B., J. Klumperman, S. Davanger, and R.H. Scheller. 1997 . Mol. Biol. Cell. 8:1261-1271) that enters and then exits the regulated secretory pathway during granule maturation. Thus, we hypothesize that during secretory granule maturation, MPR-ligand complexes and syntaxin 6 are removed from IGs by AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles, and then delivered to endosomes.",

            "text": "T he TGN is involved in sorting and packaging of cargo and membrane proteins into carrier vesicles for distinct anterograde transport pathways in the cell. The best understood vesicle export from the TGN involves the sorting of lysosomal enzymes. In the Golgi complex, newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes acquire mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) 1 residues that are recognized by either of the two types of M6P receptor (MPR), the cation-dependent (CD) and cation-independent (CI) MPR (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989; von Figura, 1991) . Both MPRs contain cytosolically exposed information that can be recognized by adaptor protein (AP) complexes that are recruited to membranes of the TGN (Robinson and Kreis, 1992; Stamnes and Rothman, 1993; Traub et al., 1993; Le Borgne et al., 1996) , thereby initiating formation of a clathrin coat (Le Borgne and Hoflack, 1997) . The subsequently formed clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) mediate the delivery of MPR-enzyme complexes to endosomes (Ludwig et al., 1991; Geuze et al., 1992; Klumperman et al., 1993) . Syntaxin 6, a soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein with homology both to syntaxin 1 and synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kD (SNAP-25) (Bock et al., 1996) , is thought to be incorporated into these endosome-bound vesicles and is implicated in their docking and/or fusion (Bock et al., 1997) .",

The clathrin coat on IGs is typically found on membrane evaginations. Interestingly, recent in vitro studies also indicate that bovine brain AP-1 can be recruited to (rat) PC12 cellderived IGs (Dittie et al., 1996) . Taken together with the fact that CCVs uncoat before they fuse with a target membrane (for review see Schmid, 1997) , the presence of clathrin-coated buds on IGs suggests the formation of CCVs that are involved in the removal of components from maturing granules.",

Several different destinations have been hypothesized (Arvan and Castle, 1992; Dittie et al., 1996) . First, IG-derived CCVs might recycle components to less mature granules or the TGN (Geuze and Kramer, 1974; Kelly, 1985; Dittie et al., 1997) . Second, they might mediate an anterograde traffic step in the constitutive-like secretory pathway (i.e., involving vesicular transport from maturing granules under unstimulated conditions), ultimately leading to release of small amounts of secretory protein at the cell surface (for review see Arvan and Castle, 1992; Grimes and Kelly, 1992) . Third, they might fuse with endosomes (see below). It should be noted that the latter hypothesis may encompass both of the former alternatives.",

These data suggested that, like TGN-derived CCVs, IGderived CCVs participate in the normal intracellular transport of newly synthesized lysosomal proenzymes. In the present study, we endeavor to solidify the link between the presence of clathrin-coated buds on IGs and the vesicular egress of specific protein components from this compartment. At the same time, we have attempted to generalize our model of IG-based sorting to endocrine as well as exocrine systems. With this in mind, we provide the first comprehensive in situ localization of MPRs and AP-1 in both endocrine pancreatic cells, as well as in exocrine parotid and pancreatic cells, indicating that these molecules are removed from granules as they mature. The removal of MPRs in AP-1/clathrin-coated buds represents selective sorting, since we demonstrate that the membrane protein phogrin is not removed from maturing granules. A rationale for these findings in exocrine cell types is provided by new observations suggesting that lysosomal proenzymes do indeed enter IGs, to be sorted out later. Moreover, we have made the first demonstration that the clathrin-coated buds emerging from IGs contain syntaxin 6, the same SNARE protein implicated in vesicle traffic from the TGN to endosomes (Bock et al., 1997) , which is lost during granule maturation in parallel with the loss of AP-1 and MPRs. From these data, we have proven that IGs actively participate in membrane and luminal protein sorting as part of the general mechanism underlying the de novo generation of mature secretory granules.",

(Multiple) Immunolabeling was performed according to the protein A-gold method, as described previously (Slot et al., 1991) . Mouse-derived antibodies (proinsulin and syntaxin 6) were indirectly marked by protein A-gold via a rabbit anti-mouse IgG bridging antibody. To establish the relative distribution patterns of CD-MPR, AP-1, phogrin, and syntaxin 6 (see Table I ), areas of the grid were selected that contained cells exhibiting well-preserved ultrastructure. Then, at a magnification of 20,000, the gold particles were counted randomly by scanning along fixed tracks, and each encountered gold particle was attributed to the compartment over which it was located, based on gold particles that were within a distance of \u202b\u0641\u202c 30 nm from a membrane. The number of gold particles found over each of these compartments was finally expressed as a percentage of the total number of gold particles counted. In pancreatic \u2424 -cells, quantitations were performed in sections that were double-immunogold labeled for proinsulin and CD-MPR, AP-1 or phogrin, which allowed us to identify IGs by the presence of proinsulin label (Kuliawat et al., 1997) . By this definition, 20-25% of all granules were considered immature in different experiments. In these cells, 525 gold particles were counted for CD-MPR, 699 for AP-1, and 504 for phogrin, respectively. In exocrine cells, morphological criteria were used to distinguish newly formed granules (moderately dense content, irregularly shaped, and with considerable size variation), from mature granules (dense content, uniformly sized, lacking membrane buds, and with a characteristic oval or round appearance). In exocrine pancreas, of all secretory granules, \u202b\u0641\u202c 20% were immature by this definition. In these cells, 500 gold particles were counted for CD-MPR and 1,287 for AP-1. In our preparation of parotid cells, \u202b\u0641\u202c 35% of all secretory granules were considered immature. In these cells, 485 gold particles were counted for syntaxin 6 and 504 for AP-1. To establish the degree of colocalization for syntaxin 6 and AP-1, double immunogold-labeled grids were randomly searched for syntaxin 6-positive membranes with a morphologically apparent clathrin coat. Each coated, syntaxin 6-positive membrane, i.e., TGN membranes and vesicles as well as IGs, was then scored as positive or negative for AP-1. In both \u2424 -cells and parotid, 300 syntaxin 6-and clathrin-positive membranes were analyzed this way.",

This entry into IGs is not inhibited when the normal carbohydrate-dependent mechanism of ProB sorting is partially or completely blocked, but efficient sorting out of maturing granules requires a high affinity for MPRs. We reasoned that if lysosomal enzymes exit the regulated secretory pathway via a similar mechanism to that operative in the TGN, then one should predict the presence of MPRs and AP-1 in IGs. In \u2424 cells, immunoreactivity with an antibody against a proinsulin cleavage site (Arg31-Arg32) is one criterion that can be used to discriminate IGs from mature granules (Orci et al., 1985; Kuliawat et al., 1997) . In the present study, we used this antiproinsulin antibody in double-immunogold labeling studies to perform a detailed morphological analysis of the subcellular distribution of CD-MPR and AP-1 in \u2424 cells.",

The concentration of phogrin in the plasma membrane and endosomes was below detection level, consistent with relatively rapid reuptake and recycling to the biosynthetic pathway after exocytosis.

To test this question, we began by immunogold localization of cathepsin B in rat parotid acinar cells. This tissue was of particular interest because it has been previously reported that using this technique, secretory granules fail to label with an antibody raised against rat liver cathepsin B (Tooze et al., 1991 b ) , whereas lysosomes in these cells were positively stained. By contrast, we found that immunolabeling revealed a high number of gold particles representing cathepsin B in granules with a less dense content (i.e., IGs), whereas there were relatively few gold particles over granules with dense contents (Fig. 5 A ) . Furthermore, occasional cathepsin B immunoreactivity was detected in clathrin-coated evaginations that appeared to be budding from forming granules (Fig. 5 B ) .",

By Western blotting, the mature, \u202b\u0641\u202c 31-kD lysosomal form of cathepsin B clearly predominated in the steady state (Fig. 6 E ) , although small amounts of ProB were occasionally detected (data not shown). After synthesis, intracellular conversion of newly synthesized ProB to mature B was also apparent, but even up to 2 h of chase, a predominant fraction of the new enzyme was still in the precursor form ( Fig. 6 A ) , suggesting that this fraction had not yet been delivered to lysosomes. Interestingly, in medium samples collected during the first chase hour, unstimulated release of ProB was apparent, suggesting the possibility of transport through constitutive and/or constitutive-like secretory pathways. Exposure to isoproterenol (a secretagogue) during either the first or second chase hour clearly demonstrated stimulus-dependent release of newly synthesized amylase, the secretory granule marker from this tissue (Fig. 6 B ) . In addition, ProB release was detectably increased upon isoproterenol stimulation ( Fig.  6 C , left two lanes ). In the second chase hour, although the unstimulated secretion of ProB was much less than before, stimulated exocytosis of ProB upon secretagogue exposure was still clearly demonstrated ( Fig. 6 C, right two lanes). Although later chase times were not examined intensively along with stimulated amylase release, stimulated secretion of a diminished fraction of newly synthesized lysosomal proenzyme remained apparent, providing no evidence for formation of mature cathepsin B within stimulatable granules, at times up to 5 h of chase (Fig. 6 D) . Taken together, the morphological and biochemical data in Figs. 5 and 6 strongly suggest that ProB enters IGs in the rat parotid, but that intragranular concentrations of the hydrolase eventually decline, while the lysosomal form of cathepsin B appears gradually after a delay, ultimately achieving accumulation of mature B that is apparent upon detection at steady state. Thus, as in endocrine pancreatic \u2424 cells (Kuliawat et al., 1997) , ProB behaves as a transient resident of the regulated secretory pathway.",

Such a conclusion would suggest that secretory granules in this tissue do not serve primarily as an intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of lysosomal cathepsin B, but rather as an endpoint. By contrast, consti-tutive-like secretion from the unstimulated rat exocrine pancreas lasts up to 7 h of chase, and therefore one might predict that ProB enters IGs in this tissue, with conversion to the mature form occurring at a much slower time scale. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain a specific immunoelectron microscopic labeling for cathepsin B in exocrine pancreatic cells. Nevertheless, it was of interest to examine whether a clathrin-mediated escape route from maturing granules might also be operational in this tissue. In agreement with Tooze et al. (1991b) , upon Western blotting of freshly prepared pancreatic tissue, the predominant steady-state form of intracellular cathepsin B was the mature, \u202b-13\u0641\u202ckD lysosomal form (Fig. 6 H) , although trace amounts of ProB could be detected. However, in pulse-chase experiments up to 3 h, little or no newly synthesized ProB had yet reached lysosomes, based on conversion to the mature form. At chase times \u03fe3 h, ongoing conversion was detected (data not shown), but such long chase experiments were not routinely feasible in our hands, since a significant decline in tissue performance (i.e., stimulus-dependent secretion) was observed at these later times. However, upon secretagogue exposure during the chase period from 1-3 h, there was a modest (10-15%) stimulus-dependent release of newly synthesized amylase and other granule proteins (Fig. 6 F) along with clear stimulus-dependent release of ProB (Fig. 6 G, left two lanes) . An immunoreactive band with a molecular mass of \u202b03\u0641\u202c kD was also immunoprecipitated in the stimulated secretion, but if this band is mature B, it must have been created after secretion, since the intracellular B up to this chase time had not yet been converted from the precursor form (Fig. 6 G, right two lanes) . Thus, we cannot state with certainty the kinetics and site(s) of ProB conversion in this tissue from these data. However, unlike the results of Tooze et al. (1991b) , these data clearly indicate that ProB rather than mature B enters the IGs of the rat exocrine pancreas.",

By contrast, syntaxin 6, a mammalian homologue of yeast Pep12, has been implicated in the delivery of TGN-derived AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles to endosomes (Bock et al., 1997) . Since IGs serve at least in part as a functional extension of the TGN (Arvan and Castle, 1992) , the AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles budding from IGs might contain this particular SNARE protein. Indeed, in both endocrine \u2424 cells and exocrine parotid cells, syntaxin 6 labeling was found over TGN and IG membranes, whereas mature granules were nearly devoid of label ( Figs. 7 and 8) . In \u2424 cells, 25% of all syntaxin 6 label was found in membranes exhibiting a morphologically apparent clathrin coat. Of these coated membranes positive for syntaxin 6, nearly one-third were buds emerging from IGs (Fig. 7 A) . By double-immunogold labeling, approximately half (49%) of the coated, IG-associated buds positive for syntaxin 6 were also labeled for AP-1. CD-MPR also colocalized with syntaxin 6 in IGs (Fig. 7 B) . The degree of syntaxin 6/AP-1 colocalization in the coated membranes of the TGN (53%) was similar to that observed in IGs.",

Further semiquantitative analysis showed that 12% of total syntaxin 6 label was associated with IGs, and only 3% with mature granules (Table I) .

Taken together, the data indicate a high degree of colocalization of syntaxin 6 and AP-1 in the IG-derived clathrin-coated buds of both endocrine and exocrine cells, strongly suggesting that syntaxin 6, together with MPR, is sorted out of the regulated secretory pathway via AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles.",

The \"sorting for entry\" model hypothesizes a selective delivery system in the TGN, such that only regulated secretory proteins can enter IGs whereas other proteins are excluded. However, in regulated secretory cells, the high flow rate into IGs may limit the sorting efficiency for certain kinds of proteins in the TGN. For such molecules, an extended sorting opportunity provided by IGs might lead to increased sorting efficiency. With this in mind, the \"sorting by retention\" model postulates that selective sorting of soluble proteins may not be required at the entry point into forming granules, but as IG maturation progresses, the condensation of regulated proteins improves the efficiency of their retention, whereas other luminal proteins can be sorted out efficiently (by receptors) (Kuliawat and Arvan, 1994) or inefficiently (by fluid-phase transport) (Kuliawat and Arvan, 1992) .",

First, we have now provided powerful immunoelectron microscopic evidence (Figs. 1-4 and Table I ) that MPRs are present in both endocrine and exocrine IGs, that MPRs colocalize with AP-1 in clathrin-coated evaginations that bud from these IGs, and that the densities of CD-MPR and AP-1 decrease in parallel, \u202b,%09\u0641\u202c upon maturation of secretory granules. The selectivity of MPR removal from maturing granules is proven by the fact that phogrin, a membrane protein of insulin granules, exhibits no retrieval from IGs. Second, immunoelectron microscopy of rat parotid tissue indicates the presence of cathepsin B immunoreactivity in IGs of this exocrine tissue, including finding the enzyme in IG-associated clathrin-coated buds, whereas few gold particles are observed at later stages of granule maturation (Fig. 5) . Moreover, our biochemical data establish unequivocally that in exocrine cells of both the parotid and pancreas, a significant fraction of newly synthesized procathepsin B molecules initially enter the stimulus-dependent secretory pathway, just as has been observed in the endocrine pancreatic \u2424 cells ( Fig. 6 ; Kuliawat and Arvan, 1994; Kuliawat et al., 1997) . Importantly, these data overturn the previous hypothesis that mature B can be formed in the TGN of exocrine secretory tissues (Tooze et al., 1991b) , although extracellular activation of ProB after secretion (especially from the exocrine pancreas) must be viewed as a distinct possibility (Fig. 6) . The finding that, under physiological conditions, mature exocrine secretory granules have low levels of cathepsin B-immunogold label, whereas mature cathepsin B is the predominant form detected at steady state (by Western blotting), is consistent with the scenario that lysosomal proenzymes and MPRs independently enter IGs, whereafter MPR-ligand complexes are routed out of the regulated secretory pathway by AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles during granule maturation. At the approximate time of their arrival in lysosomes, we hypothesize that cathepsin B and other hydrolases are converted to their mature forms, except under pathological circumstances that may potentially lead to premature enzyme activation (Hirano et al., 1991) .",

            "text": "Recently, the membrane-associated form of carboxypeptidase E (CPE), an enzyme involved in prohormone processing, has been proposed to serve as a receptor mediating the transport of regulatory proteins into IGs of neuroendocrine cells (Cool et al., 1997) . However, no evidence presented to date has distinguished an action of CPE in sorting for entry (i.e., at the TGN) versus sorting by retention (i.e., in IGs). Further, proteins that are not thought to interact with CPE have been reported to efficiently enter the regulated secretory pathway of neuroendocrine cells (Burgess et al., 1985; Fennewald et al., 1988; Stahl et al., 1996) . Nevertheless, for some regulated secretory proteins, association with other binding proteins may well facilitate the entry step into IGs. However, based on the fact that (a) lysosomal proenzymes can abundantly enter IGs in a manner independent of recognition by known receptors (Kuliawat and Arvan, 1994) ; (b) prohydrolase departure from maturing granules occurs by a mechanism whose efficiency is dependent on binding affinity for MPRs (Kuliawat et al., 1997) ; and (c) there is a significant decline of MPR immunolabeling over granules as they mature (this report), we suggest that in both endocrine and exocrine secretory cells, at least a portion of (soluble and membrane) proteins not destined for storage in mature granules may routinely advance from the TGN into IGs, only to be sorted out subsequently. This is the first report of the SNARE protein syntaxin 6 in the regulated secretory pathway, as well as its removal (by AP-1/clathrin-coated buds) from IGs and the TGN, in endocrine and exocrine cells. Indeed, we observed a parallel decline in syntaxin 6 labeling with AP-1 during granule maturation (Figs. 7 and 8 and Table I ). According to the SNARE hypothesis, there is a requirement for specific protein interactions in order that specific membrane fusion events may proceed (Sollner et al., 1993) . Our data indicate the distinct possibility that it may be necessary to remove certain inappropriate SNARE proteins from the regulated secretory pathway to create the identity of mature secretory granules, thereby preserving their fusion specificity for the cell surface. Furthermore, the relatively high amount of syntaxin 6 in IG and TGN-derived clathrin-coated buds, and its efficient removal from maturing (Table I) , suggests that syntaxin 6 is actively sorted into CCVs and may function in a SNARE complex that leads to the fusion of these vesicles with membranes of the endosomal system. Current evidence indicates that syntaxin 6, which shares homology with syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (Bock et al., 1996) , is the mammalian counterpart of the yeast Pep12. Yeast cells expressing mutant Pep12, like certain other class D vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) mutants, accumulate small post-Golgi vesicles that are thought to be involved in the delivery of soluble hydrolase precursors to the prevacuolar compartment (Becherer et al., 1996) . Likewise, syntaxin 6 has been implicated in the targeting/fusion of TGN-derived AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles with the endosomal system by forming a complex including mVPS45, just as Pep12 forms a complex with yeast VPS45 (Bock et al., 1996; Tellam et al., 1997) . Thus, the data in regulated secretory cells (this report) suggest that IG-derived as well as TGN-derived, MPR-positive, AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles may use syntaxin 6 as part of their mechanism for targeting/fusion with endosomal membranes. However, our data do not formally exclude the possibility that syntaxin 6 could serve its function as a SNARE either before it enters TGN-or IG-derived CCVs, or after its delivery to membranes of the endosomal system. Clearly, further research will be needed to demonstrate syntaxin 6 function as well as its precise site(s) of action.",

We must remain open to the possibility that vesicle budding kinetics and efficiency might vary between granules or between cells, therefore persisting at low levels at relatively late stages of apparent granule maturation. It is interesting to note that lysosomal proenzymes would not be expected to bind MPRs at the acidic pH normally found in mature endocrine granules, whereas mature exocrine granules are not especially acidic (Arvan et al., 1984; Orci et al., 1987) , which would allow prolonged MPR-ligand interaction and favor a more prolonged sorting track in these tissues. Indeed, this possibility might help to reconcile the apparent slow conversion of procathepsin B to the mature form in exocrine tissues (Fig.  6 ) as well as the detection of cathepsin B immunoreactivity reported in seemingly mature granules (Tooze et al., 1991b) . However, we emphasize that procathepsin B normally requires an extremely acidic environment for intramolecular autocatalysis to the mature form (Mach et al., 1994) ; thus, in contrast to the conclusion of Tooze et al. (1991b) , we feel strongly-and our data are consistent with the idea-that the cathepsin B that enters the regulated secretory pathway represents the inactive precursor form.",

Label is present on the limiting membrane of an IG (i) with less dense contents, but absent from those with highly condensed contents. Additional label is seen in a CCV (large arrowhead) as well as in noncoated TGN vesicles and tubules (small arrowheads). Inset, Colocalization of AP-1 (10-nm gold) and syntaxin 6 (15-nm gold) in a clathrin-coated (arrows) region of an IG. Bars, 200 nm. Rothman, 1993; Traub et al., 1993; Le Borgne et al., 1996) and/or stabilization of the AP-1/clathrin coat in the TGN (Le Borgne and Hoflack, 1997) , leading to integrated sorting of luminal-, transmembrane-, and cytoplasmic-complexed proteins (Schmid, 1997) . Recent studies (Kuliawat and Arvan, 1994; Dittie et al., 1996; Kuliawat et al., 1997) and the data in this report are consistent with a role for MPRs in the formation of AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles from maturing granules, and for syntaxin 6 in the targeting of those vesicles to endosomes. It seems probable that additional selected membrane proteins are sorted out of IGs by vesicle budding, perhaps involving coat recruitment, whereas other proteins (e.g., phogrin) are destined to be retained. Certain isoforms of peptidylglycine-\u2423-amidatingmono-oxygenase have been proposed to exit maturing granules via vesicle budding (Milgram et al., 1994) . Also furin, a membrane-bound endoprotease that resides predominantly in the TGN and actively recycles through multiple compartments, has recently been reported to be present in isolated IGs but not mature granules (Dittie et al., 1997) . Even acid phosphatase has been reported to be removed selectively during granule maturation (Novikoff et al., 1977) . Future studies will be needed to determine whether each of these membrane proteins exits maturing granules via the same class of clathrin-coated vesicles.",
