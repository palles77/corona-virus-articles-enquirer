An index representing pyrolysis reactivity of waste was presented. Kinetic parameters were obtained by Coats-Redfern method and used to model the TG curve. The results showed that: (a) Plastic, protein, cellulosic material, synthetic fibre, and rubber entered pyrolysis process in succession. (b) There was one decomposition stage in the pyrolysis of one-off medical glove, operating glove, cellulosic waste, absorbable catgut suture and adhesive plaster, while other components had two obvious weight loss stages. (c) The obtained apparent activation energy for second stage pyrolysis was comparably higher than that for first stage. (d) Each stage was controlled by only one kinetic mechanism, in which kinetic parameters were constant. (e) The degradation kinetics of medical waste may be affected by special physical and chemical treatment in the product manufacturing process. (f) Among 13 waste samples, the pyrolysis index of cellulosic matter was the highest, which indicated cellulosic matter had strong pyrolysis reactivity. (g) With increasing heating rate, TG curve and DTG peak shifted to high temperatures and main reaction interval of the sample became longer.",

For example, diseases like diarrhea, leptospirosis, typhoid and cholera can be transmitted through mismanagement of wastes. Moreover, because of the recent acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) dilemma, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, Avian influenza and those posed by other communicable diseases such as hepatitis B, the public is increasingly concerned over the handling of medical waste.",

There are many other technologies such as autoclaving, gas sterilization, and chemical disinfection, but many unavoidable disadvantages exist in each method, such as tail gas pollution and exhaust of dioxins to the environment in waste incineration. Now a novel pyrolysis technology for the treatment of medical waste is coming into use (Zhang et al., 2003) , which could reduce waste mass, make it innocuous, and finally convert it into fuel; the technology has been proposed for the treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW) and biomass by many scientists (S\u00f8rum et al., 2001; Font and Williams, 1995; Garc\u00eda et al., 1995) . In China, high-temperature pyrolysis technology has been designated in centralized treatment technology criterion of medical waste issued Dec 2003 by the government. So it is important to have knowledge on the characterization of medical waste related to pyrolysis.",

            "text": "It can be observed that the initial and final temperatures of the decomposition of all samples are different. This is attributed to the difference in pyrolysis characteristics of experimental materials. Below 150\u00b0C, the cellulosic fraction, protein fraction and synthetic fiber fraction show slight weight loss due to water evaporation, while between 200 and 290\u00b0C, all samples enter a strong weight loss process successively, which denotes that pyrolysis is taking place; up to 600\u00b0C, most compositions slow or nearly finish the procedure except catheter, whose visible weight loss still occurs between 680 and 780\u00b0C; up to 800\u00b0C. Fourteen samples finally end their pyrolysis. However, for existence of subordinate reaction, there was no absolute plain tailing section even in end of the TG curve for most test samples. Taking into account the information described above, the hearth temperature of the pyrolytic reactor should be 800\u00b0C or higher in engineering design, to ensure the farthest reaction. Many medical waste compositions show one major weight loss stage. However, for other components, like tube for transfusion, sample collector for urine, catheter, filling of dressing and dressing, there appear two stair stepping stages (see Fig. 1 ), which are clearly expressed with two prominent peaks in Fig. 2 . This is caused by the individual physical and chemical composition of each test matter, playing a fundamental role in pyrolytic behavior. For example, tube for transfusion mainly consists of PVC (polyvinyl chloride), presenting two-stage degradation behavior. The first stage is the de-hydrochlorination of the polymer and the formation of a proportion of volatile organic compounds; during the second stage, the evolution of toluene together with a small quantity of other alkyl aromatics takes place, yielding a residual char (Marcilla and Beltran, 1995) . In the case of dressing, the multi-material containing paper, synthetic fibre and gauze, such three physical ingredients control the pyrolytic behavior together, presenting two-stage weight loss. Table 2 shows the key temperature points of the TG and DTG curve of every test specimen, containing temperature interval DT, extrapolated onset temperature T onset , extrapolated endset temperature T endset and temperature at the peak maximum T max of every stage weight loss of decomposition. Thus, it is observed that the obvious weight loss of plastic matter occur at 200-580\u00b0C, with two-stage decomposition for tube for transfusion, sample collector for urine and one-stage decomposition for one-off medical glove. The degradation of rubber matter take place in 250-500\u00b0C, connected to the pyrolysis of natural rubber, with maximum rate of weight loss at 396\u00b0C. But there is still second stage weight loss for catheter as stated above. The decomposition of cellulosic and protein matter appear in 200-420\u00b0C and 230-480\u00b0C, respectively, with the T max at 382\u00b0C and 350\u00b0C, respectively. For the synthetic fibre fraction (filling of dressing), two stages of weight loss in 270-390\u00b0C and 390-510\u00b0C can be observed. The last fraction, multi-material, showing a more complex reaction behavior at 220-470\u00b0C, has not been discussed here. It is concluded that plastic, protein, cellulosic matter, synthetic fiber and rubber matter enter the pyrolysis process one by one; however, the pyrolysis process of plastic and synthetic fiber ends after that of other materials.",

Thus I r was calculated for each peak of every material, and then the weighted mean value for those which had two weight loss peaks was obtained. The results at a heating rate of 20\u00b0C/min are reported in Table 2 . Of course, I r is still related to particle size, property of feedstock and influenced by heat transfer and mass transfer of the procedure. Comparing the results, it is clear that the cellulosic fraction (a bit lower for cotton swabs) and operating glove have the highest value of I r , plastic matter, with cotton swabs and adhesive plaster in the next place; the lowest is the value for catheter, protein fraction, filling of dressing and dressing. So, in view of pyrolytic reactivity, samples may be ranked in the same decreasing order. The lower the value of I r , the poorer the ability to pyrolyze. This is in agreement with the visual experimental results. Fig. 3 show TG and DTG curves of tube for transfusion (TFT) decomposition at different heating rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50\u00b0C/min. The shift of the peak to high temperatures and the spread of the main reaction section can be observed when the heating rate is increased. This is because when the heat transfer rate is not high, temperature differences and temperature gradients increase in combination with a serious effect of thermal lag, between test point and specimen, outer layer and inside of specimen. A lower heating rate helps to reduce the phenomena.",

Because characteristic physical and chemical composition of medical waste compositions play a fundamental role in pyrolytic behavior, many of them show one major weight loss stage, but others appear in two stair-stepping stages. The activation energy of secondary stage pyrolysis is quite higher than that of the first stage and that of only one stage. 2. The maximum of rate of weight loss highly centralizes within 310-450\u00b0C. 3. The weight loss of the absolute majority of test samples is up to 95% at 800\u00b0C, which proves that the pyrolysis technology can remarkably reduce the mass of waste. 4. When the heating rate increases, the TG curve and DTG peak shift to high temperatures and the main reaction interval of the sample becomes longer. 5. It is advisable that assuming that every stage pyrolysis of medical waste components was only controlled by one major reaction mechanism; the kinetic parameters in this stage were invariable with temperature increasing. 6. It is observed that, roughly, the results show a comparatively good agreement between calculated and experimental curves, proving that the model of single reaction mechanism dominating each decomposition stage is adoptable. 7. From the comparison with kinetic parameters obtained by other authors, some results are very close, others show an acceptable dispersion. Differences can be attrib-uted to the effect of experimental conditions, to the kinetic model used, and especially to the special physical and chemical treatment of medical wastes in the manufacturing process for meeting medical application.",
