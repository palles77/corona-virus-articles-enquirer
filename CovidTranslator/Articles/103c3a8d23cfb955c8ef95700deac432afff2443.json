By selectively tagging a protein with ubiquitin, the enzymes of the UPS can reduce the half-life of a protein from months to minutes. The tagging process requires a trio of different protein classes called E1, E2 and E3 that sequentially activate ubiquitin and attach it to the substrate. Degradation by the proteasome requires that proteins be tagged with multiple ubiquitin molecules, generally in the form of a ubiquitin chain. Proteases that remove ubiquitin from substrates, called deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), can modulate degradation. Additional proteins act as receptors for ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins. Altogether, over 1,000 proteins may function in the UPS, yielding a vast playground for exploratory chemical biology and drug development. Here we describe challenges and successes in developing selective compounds that modulate the UPS. For a more comprehensive description of compounds that we do not have room to discuss, we refer the reader to ref. 1.",

Isopeptide bond formation occurs in at least three distinct steps. First, the C terminus of ubiquitin is activated by E1. This reaction uses ATP and proceeds through the formation of a ubiquitin-adenylate intermediate, which is subsequently transferred to a cysteine on E1, forming a ubiquitin-E1 thioester. Next, this charged, high-energy form of ubiquitin is transferred to a cysteine of an E2. In the final step, ubiquitin is transferred to the substrate lysine with the assistance of a RING domain-containing E3, which brings the E2 and substrate in close proximity and also enhances the ability of the E2 to transfer ubiquitin to the substrate. In an alternative pathway, E3s of the HECT and RBR classes accept ubiquitin from E2 in the form of a thioester before transferring it to the substrate. Cysteine chemistry also predominates in ubiquitin removal, as most DUBs are thiol-containing proteases that use an active site cysteine to hydrolyze the isopeptide bond.",

Many reported inhibitors of E1, E2s and DUBs contain electrophiles, and thus these compounds tend to have limited specificity, decreasing their usefulness as tool compounds and hindering their development into drugs.

This approach can be performed using assays that measure the individual biochemical functions of purified enzymes, in a manner analogous to profiling of ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors against a panel of kinases, or by using newly developed proteomics methods 2,3 . Furthermore, demonstrating reversibility of inhibition is important in ruling out compounds that react with the active site. In addition, we propose that testing whether compounds induce Nrf 2 could help flag reactive compounds. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that induces expression of antioxidant genes 4 . Its levels are regulated by an E3 called KEAP1. In unperturbed cells, KEAP1 promotes ubiquitylation of Nrf2, keeping Nrf2 levels low. However, when oxidants or electrophiles are present, KEAP1 is inactivated, causing Nrf2 to accumulate and activate expression of its targets. KEAP1 has many cysteine residues, with varied reactivity profiles, making it sensitive to a wide range of xenobiotics and electrophiles. Reactive cysteines are dispersed over the functional domains of KEAP1, and their modification may inhibit KEAP1 through different mechanisms. Because KEAP1 can detect a wide range of electrophiles, an Nrf2 reporter assay may be a simple counterscreen for detecting reactive compounds.",

One of the UBLs, called Nedd8, dynamically modifies a large class of E3 enzymes, the cullin-RING ligases, turning on their activity. Because cullin-RING ligases regulate cell proliferation, the Nedd8 E1 (NAE) emerged as a possible target for cancer treatment. Millennium developed a remarkable inhibitor, MLN4924, a reactive analog of AMP that intercepts the normal pathway of Nedd8 activation 5, 6 . Normally, NAE binds Nedd8 and ATP, creating a Nedd8adenylate intermediate that is attacked by an active site cysteine in E1, forming an E1-Nedd8 thioester (Fig. 1a) . In the presence of MLN4924, however, the E1-Nedd8 thioester is attacked by the reactive element of the AMP analog, forming a covalent MLN4924-Nedd8 intermediate that remains tightly (but noncovalently) bound to the enzyme, blocking its function (Fig. 1b,c) . Drawing from the kinase inhibitor field, subtle modifications to the purine and ribose elements of the inhibitor made it selective for the NAE relative to the ubiquitin E1. In principle, it should be possible to use the strategy to develop selective inhibitors for the activation of ubiquitin and the entire set of UBL proteins. The remarkable feature of this inhibitor is that Nedd8 itself is a component of the inhibitory species. By incorporating Nedd8, the inhibitor extends its contact area with NAE and thus exhibits a very low off-rate (Fig. 1c) .",

E2s typically govern the topology with which ubiquitin chains are constructed by RING ligases. For example, the E2 Cdc34 elongates ubiquitin chains linked through Lys48 of ubiquitin. A selective inhibitor of this E2, CC0651, was discovered in a biochemical screen for inhibitors of ubiquitination of p27 (ref. 7) . Screening a panel of E2s suggested that effects were specific for Cdc34 compared to other E2s. Surprisingly, biochemical studies showed that CC0651 did not covalently inactivate Cdc34 or block its ability to accept ubiquitin from E1. Instead, the compound slows the discharge of ubiquitin from the E2 by binding a composite interface formed by residues from Cdc34 and ubiquitin ( Fig. 2a-c) 8 . CC0651 thus has a much higher affinity for the E2-ubiquitin complex relative to the free enzyme. free enzyme. By binding the E2-ubiquitin interface, the compound impairs the ability of the enzyme to transfer its ubiquitin to the substrate in the presence of E3. CC0651 makes contacts with residues in Cdc34 that are not conserved in other E2s, explaining its specificity. Open questions include whether it will be possible to use this strategy to develop highly potent compounds that can be used as drugs and whether selective inhibitors of other E2s can be obtained by exploiting a similar principle.",

Many reported inhibitors of these thiol proteases are not very selective 3 and may inactivate their enzyme targets covalently. Even for inhibitors that appear to be reversible and selective, we do not yet understand the basis of selectivity from a structural perspective. One exception is GRL0617, which inhibits the papain-like protease (PLpro) that is required for cleavage of the viral polyprotein from the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome 9 . This protease also cleaves ubiquitin and has structural homology to DUBs of the USP family. A lead compound was discovered in a high-throughput screen, followed by medicinal chemistry optimization, to yield GRL0617, which inhibits the enzyme with a halfmaximum inhibitory concentration of 600 nM. Structural analysis indicates that the compound binds away from the catalytic cysteine, in the S4 and S3 subsites of the enzyme that normally receive the C-terminal tail of ubiquitin ( Fig. 3a-d) . Binding of the inhibitor is stabilized by closure of a loop that would otherwise wrap around the ubiquitin tail. Structural alignment of PLpro with the closely related enzyme Usp7 indicates that two residues of Usp7 sterically clash with the GRL0617 binding site, explaining why the inhibitor is specific for PLpro relative to Usp7. The same residues are found in 80% of other USPs, suggesting GRL0617 is unlikely to inhibit these enzymes either.",

IU1 is an inhibitor of the proteasome-associated DUB Usp14 (ref. 10 ). This inhibitor is reversible, shows little activity against other DUBs and is 20-fold selective relative to the highly related enzyme Usp5. Recently, new derivatives of IU1 have been developed that show nanomolar potency while retaining selectivity (unpublished data). In cells, IU1 accelerates the degradation of a subset of UPS substrates, including tau, by antagonizing proteasome-dependent deubiquitination. This effect is lost in cells lacking Usp14, indicating that these effects are mediated through Usp14 inhibition. Usp14 is strongly activated by binding to the proteasome, and IU1 inhibits only the active form of the enzyme. Although this has hampered structural analysis of the IU1-Usp14 interaction, it suggests that the IU1 binding site is only formed as the enzyme is activated.",

A selective inhibitor of Usp7 was found to have activity in an animal model of multiple myeloma 12 , suggesting that targeting DUBs may be an effective approach in cancer. Usp7 inhibitors also highlight a counterintuitive principle: that DUB inhibitors can block proteolysis of a UPS substrate, albeit indirectly. This effect has its origin in the capacity of many E3s to undergo autoubiquitination. In this case, Usp7 antagonizes the ubiquitination of the E3 Hdm2. As Hdm2-induced autoubiquitylation leads to its destruction, inhibitors of Usp7 promote the degradation of Hdm2, which in turn stabilizes Hdm2 substrates, particularly p53. By stabilizing p53, these compounds may be useful for treatment of certain cancers. Another example of positive regulation of a ligase by DUBs is provided by recent work on the enzyme DUBA. When this is induced in activated T cells, it suppresses inflammation by deubiquitinating and thus stabilizing the ligase UBR5 (V. Dixit, Genentech, personal communication).",

An interesting example has been discovered in plants. Auxin is a canonical plant hormone that works through the Tir1 E3 to govern morphogenesis, growth and other processes. The hormonal effects of auxin are achieved by targeting a family of transcriptional repressors for ubiquitin-dependent destruction. In the absence of auxin, substrates of Tir1 are not efficiently recognized because a required portion of the substrate binding pocket is absent. When auxin binds Tir1, it completes the pocket and engages in direct contacts with substrates (Fig. 3e) 13 . Recent work suggests that a similar principle can be exploited in drug development. In 1999, thalidomide was discovered serendipitously to be effective in multiple myeloma, but its mechanism of action remained unclear for over a decade. Biochemical studies revealed that thalidomide interacts with an E3 called cereblon and may antagonize the degradation of some substrates 14 . Lenalidomide was identified as a more potent and effective version of thalidomide and also binds cereblon, but surprisingly it was found not to inhibit but to promote the degradation of two transcription factors essential for the viability of myeloma cells 15, 16 . Structural studies indicate that lenalidomide docks within a cavity that is presumably located in the substrate binding pocket 17, 18 . A portion of lenalidomide that projects out from this cavity may promote a new binding interaction between the E3 and these substrates, in a manner markedly analogous to that of auxin (Fig. 3f,g) .",

In mammals, a key element of the circadian clock is cryptochrome (Cry), a transcriptional repressor that undergoes diurnal cycles of synthesis and degradation. Cry is a flavoprotein, and its exchangeable cofactor FAD competes with a ubiquitin ligase, FBXL3, for Cry binding 19 . Thus the presence of the endogenous compound acts as an antagonist of the degradation of the protein, essentially the opposite of what happens for auxin. An interesting future question is whether other endogenous metabolites in human cells also regulate protein stability, either by promoting or inhibiting E3 recognition of substrates.",

For example, potent compounds have been developed that block the interaction between p53 and its E3, the abovementioned Hdm2 (ref. 1). Tool compounds have been identified that block substrate recognition by other E3s as well. Recently we have found that using a combination of small molecules that target substrate recognition and activator protein binding can be effective in inactivating a large, multisubunit E3, the anaphase-promoting complex 20 . The compounds synergistically inhibit anaphasepromoting complex function because the substrate promotes cooperative binding of the activator to the E3.",

In the absence of substrate binding, an E3 called XIAP inhibits its own E3 activity through intramolecular interactions. Upon disruption of these interactions by a small molecule, the E3 dimerizes and becomes active, but in the absence of substrate it tends to ubiquitylate itself rather than its substrate, resulting in ubiquitin-dependent destruction of XIAP 21 . It will be interesting to determine whether this feature of E3 regulation can be exploited to inhibit other E3s in the future.",

To develop general rules regarding the best approach for the identification of selective compounds is difficult, however, because E1s, E2s, E3s and DUBs represent different classes of enzymes (even DUBs alone represent five distinct enzyme classes). Nonetheless, some interesting themes emerge from the analysis of these examples. First, it is possible to exploit interactions between ubiquitin and its target enzyme to develop selective inhibitors, as illustrated by the E1 inhibitor MLN4924 and the E2 inhibitor CC0651. Recent proof-of-principle experiments suggest it might be possible to exploit a similar strategy to inhibit DUBs, as it is possible to identify mutants of ubiquitin that bind specific DUBs with high affinity and inhibit their activity 22, 23 . Perhaps it will be possible to mimic this effect by identifying small molecules that stabilize the binding of ubiquitin to its DUB in a manner analogous to the effect of CC0651 on the E2 Cdc34.",

Another effective approach for establishing the specificity of a compound is to determine whether genetic ablation of the enzyme abrogates the physiological effects of the inhibitor.

An interesting lesson from the auxin, thalidomide and lenalidomide examples is that one may readily turn inhibitors into activators, or activators into inhibitors, by subtle changes in the chemical structure of the ligand. For example, an inhibitor of the auxin system, auxinole, was developed, which antagonizes substrate binding rather than promoting it 24 . Similarly, thalidomide is thought to antagonize binding of physiological cereblon substrates, whereas lenalidomide promotes binding of what appear to be 'neo-substrates'. How small changes in molecular structure can affect binding of substrates to E3s is a fascinating problem for future work on the chemical biology of E3s.",

The clinical utility of thalidomide and subsequently lenalidomide was discovered empirically before their molecular mechanisms were understood. Similarly, arsenic trioxide and retinoic acid were approved for promyelocytic leukemia well before we understood that they modify an essential oncoprotein to make it susceptible to destruction by the UPS. Proteasome inhibitors were developed initially to combat muscle wasting; their specific toxicity to myeloma cells was discovered serendipitously using cell-based screens.
