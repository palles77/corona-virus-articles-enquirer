More and more people are traveling globally; in 2017 there were approximately 1.3 billion international tourist arrivals worldwide [1] . This growth in international travel has occurred alongside the rise of biologic drugs and other therapies for autoimmune diseases such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, as well as other forms of immunosuppression used for solid organ transplantation and treatment for malignancies. These treatments mean that those living with chronic or previously untreatable conditions are now experiencing a much-improved quality of life. Whereas previously they might have been too unwell to travel they are now able to visit a wide range of destinations and enjoy a variety of activities. Research has shown that immunosuppressed travelers follow similar travel itineraries to nonimmunocompromised travelers and around a third visit countries with low human development indices [2] . The convergence of these trends means that there is a growing population of immunosuppressed travelers with specific travel health needs.",

Both the perceptions and realities of risk will be different for each individual traveler. Clinicians may also perceive risks differently based on their training and experience. For example, national malaria guidelines differ in their advice for certain countries, and this will influence the clinician's risk assessment. When considering risk it is important to weigh the possibility of harm from a travel-related disease or event against the possibility of harm from an intervention. As with all areas of medicine, it is important to remember the dictum of \"primum non nocere\" or \"first do no harm\". An example of this might be avoiding yellow fever vaccination in a significantly immunosuppressed traveler who chooses to travel to sub-Saharan Africa.",

They may have more compelling reasons for travel at a particular time, such as to visit sick relatives or attend funerals, weddings, and other cultural events. They may therefore be more likely to travel while pregnant or with multiple comorbidities. Lack of pretravel health care is common due to health beliefs, incomplete childhood vaccinations, and other barriers to health care such as language. Malaria is one area in which popular beliefs among VFR travelers may lead to harm. Individuals often develop partial immunity to malaria if they grow up in a highly endemic area, leading to the perception of malaria as a minor illness in adults. This partial immunity can be lost, however, if the person moves away as it depends on frequent reexposure [4] . One study showed that VFR travelers were more likely to receive a diagnosis of malaria or viral hepatitis compared to non-VFR travelers. They were also less likely to seek pretravel advice [5] .",

It may either be the intended consequence of the treatment, for example immunosuppression in transplant recipients to prevent rejection, or a side effect of a treatment given for another reason, for example antiinflammatory treatments given for autoimmune disease. The exact immune defect and resulting risk of infection depends on the specific immunosuppressive agent used.

One major way that glucocorticoids influence immune function is by preventing the access of neutrophils to sites of inflammation [10] . Importantly, some of the immune effects of the glucocorticoids are dose-dependent, therefore higher doses, >40 mg a day for more than a week or >20 mg a day for over 2 weeks in adults, are more likely to be associated with significant immune deficits.

As a general rule all travelers should be up to date with their local routine vaccination schedule as well as any specific travel vaccinations that may be required for their destination. Despite being part of the routine vaccination schedule in many countries infections such as measles remain common in parts of Asia and Africa. Decreased vaccine coverage has also led to outbreaks in developed countries, including parts of Europe and the United States. The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccination is a live vaccine and is therefore contraindicated in severely immunosuppressed patients [12] .",

This is due to ongoing live virus replication after vaccination. In most cases a delay of 4 weeks is recommended. However, immunosuppressive treatment should not be delayed if it could worsen the patient's underlying condition. Specialist advice from local virology, travel medicine, clinical immunology, or infectious disease services should be sought in these circumstances [12] . [12] l Live influenza vaccine (inactivated vaccines are also available) Yellow fever virus is a flavivirus spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The virus is endemic in over 50 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America. Following a bite from an infected mosquito there is a short incubation period of under a week before the onset of the illness. The classic disease has a biphasic presentation with an initial short, nonspecific febrile illness followed by a toxic phase that develops in up to 15% of patients. The toxic phase of the illness consists of fever, renal failure, hepatic failure, jaundice, hemorrhage, and cardiovascular compromise. Multiorgan failure may develop, and up to half of patients in the toxic phase die within 7e10 days [15] . All WHO member states are bound by the International Health Regulations. These are public health measures designed to reduce the spread of disease across international boarders [16] . Yellow fever is one of the only infectious diseases where a vaccination certificate may be required from travelers as a condition of entry to a country. This requirement aims to reduce the chance of viremic individuals transporting the virus and triggering a new outbreak. Guidance from the WHO suggests that one dose of yellow fever vaccination offers lifelong protection in most cases, and a booster dose after 10 years is generally not required [17] .",

Examples of infectious diseases spread by mosquitos include malaria as well as arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, and yellow fever. Sandflies are responsible for spreading diseases such as leishmaniasis and insects of the triatominae subfamily are vectors for Chagas Disease (CD) [47] . While chemoprophylaxis is available for some infections such as malaria, bite avoidance is a crucial part of disease prevention. Indeed for many vectorborne diseases it is the only way to prevent disease transmission. Bite avoidance is achieved via the use of repellants, impregnated bed nets, appropriate clothing, and behavioral modifications. Knowledge of the biting patterns of relevant vectors is also important. For example, the Anopheles mosquito, the vector for malaria, bites mainly from dusk until dawn so bed nets can be very useful to prevent disease transmission [47] . In contrast, dengue is spread by the Aedes mosquito which also bites during the day so bed nets are not sufficient to prevent transmission. N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide, more commonly known as DEET, is recommended as the first-line repellant for travelers to areas where malaria and other arthropod-borne infections are endemic. Concentrations of 20%e50% are advised. Other repellants such as p-methane 3,8-diol (PMD) and icaridin are available for patients who are unable to use DEET, but high concentrations are necessary for effective bite prevention. Despite some concerns among the general public, DEET has been shown over many years to have an acceptable safety profile. Insecticide-treated bed nets are useful for travelers to malariaendemic areas [48] .",

Injuries, including road traffic accidents, are an important cause of death among international travelers, especially among younger age groups [106] . Crucially some of these deaths could be prevented by modification of traveler behavior. People may behave differently while traveling abroad and be more willing to adopt riskier behaviors than they would at home. A discussion about the importance of road safety precautions is therefore an important part of the pretravel medical consultation. Travelers should also be reminded that standards of emergency medical and trauma services vary widely throughout the world and may be lower or nonexistent in low-income countries [107] .",

A blood clot forms in a deep vein (a DVT), commonly in the leg; rarely this can dislodge and travel to the pulmonary arterial system (a PE) where it can cause a life-threatening obstruction [108] . VTE can be provoked by prolonged immobility associated with any form of travel. The risk of DVT approximately doubles after a long-haul flight of over 4 hours (as well as other forms of travel associated with remaining seated for long periods). The risk increases with duration of travel and taking multiple flights in a short period. The overall absolute risk in healthy travelers remains low, 1 in 6000 in flights over 4 hours [109] .",
