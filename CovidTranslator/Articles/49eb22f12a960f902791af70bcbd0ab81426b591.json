            "text": "science & society T he notion that humans, animals and the environment are tightly linked and that their respective well-beings are interdependent has been recognized for centuries. However, the sophistication of these interactions has only begun to be revealed. Even by the late nineteenth century, it was established knowledge that human and animal health have many commonalities; an insight that more recently led to the term 'One Medicine', coined in 1984 to integrate human and veterinary health and research. In 2003, after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, One Medicine evolved into the concept of 'One Health', which expands the idea beyond a focus on the health of animals and humans to include health service delivery, environmental health and ecosystem services (for further reading, see Sidebar A). It defines 'health' as a broader concept, whereby humans, animals and the environment are inextricably linked and where each need equal attention to ensure optimal health for all. Although it is an interesting and forward-looking concept, One Health has unfortunately not gained significant attention, particularly in the area of human health.",

The common host of this protozoan is the domestic cat (Felidae), in which the sexual part of the parasite's life cycle takes place (Fig 1) . However, T. gondii can infect many other warm-blooded species, from humans to birds, and has become endemic in many areas. Estimates put the number of infected humans at about 500 million, with large regional differences. Although toxoplasmosis is not usually a deadly disease, the infection does have some unpleasant side effects for many species, including its ability to modify the behaviour of rats and mice, making them drawn to, rather than fearful of, the scent of cats-probably a survival strategy for a parasite that requires cats to sexually reproduce (Sidebar A). In humans, toxoplasmosis during pregnancy can cause miscarriage and severe health effects if it infects the fetus, and it has been associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia in adults.",

Felid hosts shed Toxoplasma oocysts with their faeces into the environment, including into water systems, from which the parasite infects other species. The main routes of infection for humans are thought to be direct contact with cats and eating undercooked meat from infected sheep. However, infection could also occur through water and contaminated vegetable or fruit produce. In California, for instance, increased mortality among sea otters has been linked to the pollution of fresh water systems by T. gondii. The prevalence of T. gondii infections among humans is therefore one result of the fact that most people on the planet do not have access to clean water. However, even in developed countries, a significant number of people are infected. One might ask whether this is a serious issue, because few people infected with T. gondii have to be clinically treated. However, T. gondii and its effects are subtle: the organism might lie dormant in the host and become active many years later, and it can cause a range of clinical problems from ocular degeneration to neurological and behavioural changes (Sidebar A). As there is no reliable drug or therapy that can clear the parasite from the patient, it puts the onus on developing and implementing preventive measures.",

Rodents are preyed on by cats, which then shed the parasite into the environment, from where it infects rodents and humans. The abundance of rodents and felids therefore determines the level and distribution of T. gondii in the environment. We do not have sufficiently reliable data to model accurately this simple scenario or other more complex ecosystems, and can only guess about potential control measures. Moreover, we do not know what the effects of removing the parasite from the environment would be, as it could change population densities (Sidebar A). We also do not know what long-term effects the absence of T. gondii might have on the human immune system, as exposure to microorganisms is important for the maturation of our immune defence. T he loss of livestock animals due to disease has an economic impact on farmers and communities, whilst human health itself is affected by zoonosespathogens that can jump species. Ever since humans began to domesticate and live in close proximity to animals, animal diseases have become a serious problem for human health. One of the oldest pathogens shared between Homo sapiens and cattle is the tuberculosis-causing Mycobacterium, which might have originated in humans. Although different strains of the bacteria affect cattle (M. bovis) and humans (M. tuberculosis), the pathogens are still capable of jumping back and forth. Humans experience zoonotic tuberculosis from infected animals, and animals can be infected by humans (anthropozoonotic tuberculosis; Sidebar A). There must be many common host factors in the case of tuberculosis, as is the case with many other diseases detected in different species.",

These threats are often the consequence of humans moving into a previously undisturbed ecosystem and making contact with new pathogens and their vectors, or if human activity disrupts ecosystems and thereby modifies the behaviour, migration and interaction of pathogens and their hosts. As such, humans constitute an invasive species that causes ecosystem change, either directly by destroying pristine areas such as the rainforests, or indirectly by causing global climate change, and through global trade and travel. Analysing how human activity increases health risk requires not only the expertise of veterinarians and physicians, but should include public health experts, ecologists, sociologists and evolutionary biologists. D isease can be both a driver of and a consequence of biodiversity change. When discussing and applying the concept of One Health, it is therefore important not to limit the focus to humans or infectious diseases. Pathogens are also an important factor for species loss (Sidebar A), although most cases probably involve more than one cause. Conversely, biodiversity loss affects disease ecology (Sidebar A). Disease can change the composition and distribution of species in ecosystems. A good example is rinderpest, which affected the African savannah landscape with consequences that are still felt more than a century later, such as the balance between grassland and bush, and the change in distribution of the tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis. It can also influence land use by humans spatially or temporally-for instance, trypanosomiasis and foot-and-mouth disease have effects on agriculture and its impact on ecosystems in affected areas.",

It is anything but simple to prove causality in this case; however, ecosystems research has shown that high biodiversity is associated with tolerance and resilience, which are clearly lacking in the case of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. T he economic and health impact of animal pathogens precipitated early attempts to fight these animal diseases. In the eighteenth century, for example, Pope Clement XI issued instructions that rinderpest should be controlled, which eventually led to a common veterinary disease control practice of 'test and slaughter'.

Metagenomics of microbial diversity has already shown that the biological diversity of ecological niches is far more complex than previously thought. Meta-omics-the study of biological material from any environment on different levels of analyses-provides an even more powerful tool for observing and analysing the bacterial world. This notwithstanding, it will require greater efforts still, before we can better understand how the environment and biodiversity, through the microbiota, determine and influence human health. S adly, it seems that so far we have prioritized everything that matters only to our species, whilst animals and the environment have received short shrift. But this single-focus approach is the same approach that investment managers warn against when creating an investment portfolio; they recommend diversification of assets 'for the long haul'. We have neglected the environment-climate change, invasive species and emerging diseases are just some of the signals-in favour of our own health and comfort. But we humans are not disconnected from the environment, although many city dwellers might forget this obvious truth. Our health and wellbeing are almost entirely determined by the fauna and flora on Earth; climate change and loss of bio diversity can, therefore, have unforeseeable but ultimately drastic effects on humanity.",

            "text": "In order to better appreciate that we are inextricably linked with the planet, we propose that the concept of One Health should be taught at schools and universities. We need to revisit our training so that all humans are aware that they are but one component of the systems biology of the Earth, and that shifting the balance will almost certainly come back to haunt us in an unexpected manner. Such a shift in thinking also has consequences for how we conduct and organize research, in particular in the life sciences. Traditionally, researchers have taken a reductionist, hypothesis-driven approach to understanding biological systems and worked in small research groups to tackle one problem at a time. It is unlikely that this approach lends itself to the analysis of whole ecosystems and to applying the concept of One Health as outlined in this article. However, as more discoveries are made and more information becomes available, there is a tendency towards specialization. This sends the scientific community in the opposite direction from the One Health movement. A different strategy is needed, whereby interdisciplinary collaboration and communication, more systems studies and ultimately larger projects tackle more complex biological systems and their dynamics, as it is highly unlikely that complex webs can be described by simple relationships between a small set of variables. Viewing any one problem from a One Health perspective reveals the gaps in our knowledge and raises new questions that should be addressed. The challenge notwithstanding, it is what we need to do to achieve a sustainable future for humans, the fauna, flora and environment on Earth.",
