Although comprised of several phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets, the differentiation of specialized Treg cell populations within the periphery is poorly characterized. We demonstrate that the development of T-bet + Treg cells that potently inhibit T helper 1 (Th1) cell responses was dependent on the transcription factor STAT1 and occurred directly in response to interferon-g produced by effector T cells. Additionally, delayed induction of the IL-12Rb2 receptor component after STAT1 activation helped ensure that Treg cells do not readily complete STAT4-dependent Th1 cell development and lose their ability to suppress effector T cell proliferation. Thus, we define a pathway of abortive Th1 cell development that results in the specialization of peripheral Treg cells and demonstrate that impaired expression of a single cytokine receptor helps maintain Treg cell-suppressive function in the context of inflammatory Th1 cell responses.",

T helper 1 (Th1) cells are required for immunity to intracellular pathogens and develop from naive precursors via a multistep mechanism involving sequential activation of the transcription factors STAT1, T-bet, and STAT4. Initially, T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in conjunction with STAT1 activation by cytokines such as IFN-g induce low-level expression of the transcription factor T-bet, which in turn drives expression of the inducible IL-12 receptor component IL-12Rb2 (Afkarian et al., 2002; Mullen et al., 2001) . This allows the cells to undergo IL-12-dependent activation of STAT4, whereupon STAT4 and T-bet act independently and synergistically to drive expression of the signature inflammatory cytokine IFN-g, as well as other genes required for the proper function of Th1 cells (Thieu et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "In addition to effector Th subsets, Foxp3 + regulatory T (Treg) cells comprise a distinct CD4 + T cell lineage important for dampening inflammation and preventing autoimmunity (Sakaguchi et al., 2008) . Treg cell differentiation occurs primarily in the thymus, where developing T cells upregulate Foxp3 upon recognition of self-antigen and stimulation with IL-2 or IL-15. Thus, the TCR repertoire of Treg cells is believed to be heavily biased toward autoreactivity (Lio and Hsieh, 2011) . Like conventional CD4 + Th cells, Treg cells can be subdivided into distinct subsets on the basis of differential expression of homing receptors and activation markers (Huehn et al., 2004; Min et al., 2007) , and multiple functional mechanisms of suppression have been ascribed to Treg cells (Vignali et al., 2008; Shevach, 2009; Tang and Bluestone, 2008) . Indeed, the ability of Treg cells to control different types of Th cell responses depends on their expression of specific Th cell-associated transcription factors Koch et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2009) . For example, although T-bet is considered the ''master regulator'' of Th1 cell differentiation, Treg cells selectively upregulate T-bet during type 1 inflammatory responses in vivo, and T-betdeficient Treg cells display diminished expression of the Th1 cell-associated chemokine receptor CXCR3 and fail to rescue Foxp3-deficient mice from Th1 cell-mediated inflammatory disease (Koch et al., 2009) . Thus, the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of Treg cells helps ensure that they can modulate different types of immune responses in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissue sites (Campbell and Koch, 2011) .",

            "text": "The diversity of peripheral Treg cells suggests that they alter their migratory, functional, and homeostatic properties in response to contextual cues from the immune environment. However, the mechanisms guiding the development of specialized Treg cell subsets, and the ways in which they mirror and diverge from the comparatively well-characterized pathways of effector T cell differentiation, have not been extensively explored. In addition, the autoreactivity of Treg cells presents a significant danger if they were to acquire proinflammatory effector functions. Thus, strict mechanisms that limit the functional reprogramming of Treg cells during strong inflammatory responses are thought to exist. For instance, despite upregulating T-bet during Th1 cell inflammatory responses, T-bet + Treg cells do not typically produce IFN-g (Koch et al., 2009 ). However, IFN-g-producing Treg cells have been observed during the dysregulated immune responses associated with autoimmune disease or infection-induced immunopathologies (Oldenhove et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2011) . This has led to the notion that Treg cells retain a considerable degree of functional plasticity (Zhou et al., 2009) , although this notion has been questioned in subsequent studies (Rubtsov et al., 2010; Miyao et al., 2012) .",

Moreover, the frequency of this Treg cell population is increased during Th1 cell responses, but substantially reduced in mice lacking STAT1. This suggests that like effector T cells, Treg cells upregulate T-bet during Th1 cell responses after STAT1 activation. Consistent with this, nearly all Foxp3 + Treg cells rapidly phosphorylated STAT1 after treatment with the STAT1-activating cytokines IFN-g or IL-27 ( Figure S1 available online). Additionally, in vitro stimulation in the presence of either IFN-g or IL-27 potently induced T-bet expression in sorted CD4 + Foxp3 + CD62L + CXCR3 \u00c0 naive phenotype Treg cells (Figure 1A) . To determine whether Treg cells are exposed to STAT1-activating cytokines in vivo, we constructed mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeras using congenically marked wildtype and Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 donors and compared the phenotype of Foxp3 + Treg cells derived from each donor 8 weeks later. Indeed, whereas $25%-30% of the splenic Treg cells from the wild-type donor were T-bet + CXCR3 + , this population of Treg cells was nearly absent from the Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells ( Figure 1B) .",

However, tissue inflammation results in the upregulation of numerous inflammatory and regulatory cytokines, several of which (i.e., IL-27) can activate STAT1 and may induce T-bet and CXCR3 expression in Treg cells in the absence of IFN-g. To determine whether these cytokines can compensate for loss of IFN-g signaling during strong inflammatory responses in vivo, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a demyelinating inflammatory disease mediated by autoreactive Th1 and Th17 cells (Dardalhon et al., 2008) , in mixed BM chimeras containing a 1:1 ratio of congenically marked wild-type and Ifngr1 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells. Loss of IFN-gRmediated signaling did not impair the accumulation of CD4 + T cells in the central nervous system (CNS; data not shown). However, expression of T-bet and CXCR3 were substantially reduced in Ifngr1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Treg cells in both the CNS and spleen (Figure 1C and data not shown) . Additionally, consistent with the large amount of Il10 expressed by CXCR3 + Treg cells, Ifngr1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Treg cells in the CNS showed decreased IL-10 production at day 19 ( Figure 1D ), a late time point associated with Treg cellmediated amelioration of disease (Korn et al., 2007; McGeachy et al., 2005) . Thus, even during strong inflammatory responses associated with EAE, IFN-g promotes the functional specialization of Treg cells by controlling the expression of molecules such as CXCR3 and IL-10 that are critical for Treg cell-mediated disease suppression (McGeachy et al., 2005; M\u00fc ller et al., 2007) .",

We measured STAT4 phosphorylation after IL-12 treatment in the Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 cells daily starting at day 2 of culture. IL-12 responsiveness in the Foxp3 \u00c0 cells was evident by day 2 of activation, peaked by day 4, and was maintained throughout the remainder of the culture ( Figure 4A , top). In comparison, acquisition of IL-12 responsiveness was substantially delayed in the Foxp3 + Treg cells, which did not become IL-12 responsive until day 4 of culture ( Figure 4A , bottom). However, by day 6 the Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 cells displayed roughly equivalent STAT4 phosphorylation after IL-12 treatment. Importantly, Treg cells became IL-12 responsive on day 4 of culture even when removed from the TCR stimulus at earlier time points (day 1 or 2) postactivation (data not shown), indicating that TCR stimulation is not the primary factor inhibiting their expression of Il12rb2.",

In naive CD4 + T cells, the Il12rb2 promoter is marked by both permissive H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 histone modifications ( Figure 4C , top). Consistent with the rapid induction of Il12rb2 in developing Th1 cells, this bivalent state is believed to repress gene transcription while keeping the promoter ''poised'' for activation-induced expression (Bernstein et al., 2006) . By contrast, only H3K27me3 marks are found at the Il12rb2 promoter in Treg cells ( Figure 4C , bottom). Thus, expression in Treg cells probably requires substantial epigenetic remodeling of the Il12rb2 promoter, involving both the removal of repressive histone modifications and the addition of permissive modifications.",

Alternatively, the inability of Treg cells to produce IFN-g may result from direct inhibition of Ifng expression by Foxp3 or other Treg cell-specific repressive mechanisms. To determine how IL-12 receptor signaling functionally impacts Treg cells, we activated sorted CD4 + Foxp3 + CD62L + CXCR3 \u00c0 naive phenotype Treg cells in the presence of IFN-g for 6 days to render the cells IL-12 responsive. We then cultured these cells with or without IL-12 for 3 additional days, examined their ability to produce IFN-g, and assessed their suppressive function in vitro. Despite the reported ability of Foxp3 to directly inhibit IFN-g expression (Ono et al., 2007) , IL-12 potently induced IFN-g production in both Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 cells that had been ''primed'' with IFN-g ( Figure 5A ). In addition, IL-12 treatment substantially reduced the ability of Treg cells to inhibit effector T cell proliferation ( Figure 5B ). Thus, IL-12 can alter the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory functions in Treg cells, emphasizing the importance of regulating IL-12 responsiveness in order to maintain Treg cellmediated immune suppression during strong type 1 inflammatory responses.",

            "text": "Increasing evidence indicates that Treg cells both sense and respond to changes in the immune environment and that this is necessary for proper immunoregulation. For instance, IL-10dependent activation of STAT3 is important for the ability of Treg cells to effectively restrain Th17 cell-mediated inflammatory responses (Chaudhry et al., 2011) . Additionally, Treg cell abundance is tightly linked to the size of the dendritic cell compartment, given that depletion or expansion of dendritic cells in vivo serves to reduce or augment Treg cell numbers, respectively (Darrasse-J\u00e8 ze et al., 2009) . Treg cells are also sensitive to changes in the amount of IL-2 produced by CD4 + Foxp3 \u00c0 CD44 hi T cells, and this is thought to be a mechanism by which Treg cell abundance can be rapidly altered as the number of effector T cells fluctuates (Setoguchi et al., 2005) . Here, we show that Treg cells upregulated expression of the key transcription factor T-bet downstream of STAT1 activation in direct response to IFN-g produced by CD4 + and CD8 + effector T cells. Thus, in addition to controlling Treg cell abundance, cytokines produced by effector T cells can also drive the phenotypic and functional specialization of Treg cells. However, although we demonstrated that T cells are a key source of the IFN-g that acted on Treg cells in vivo, other IFN-g-producing populations, such as NK and NKT cells, may also influence the phenotypic and functional specialization of Treg cells when they are potently activated. Additionally, other STAT1-activating cytokines such as IL-27 or type 1 interferons may also help drive T-bet expression by Treg cells when produced in abundance during parasitic or viral infections. (A) Flow cytometric analysis of CD4 and IFN-g expression by gated CD4 + Foxp3 + (left) or Foxp3 \u00c0 (right) cells after stimulation with PMA and ionomycin. Prior to analysis, sorted Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 naive phenotype cells were activated and cultured for 6 days in the presence of IL-2 and IFN-g, after which they were washed and incubated for 3 days in media containing IL-2 with or without IL-12, as indicated. (B) Flow cytometric analysis of CFSE dilution by labeled CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 effector T cells activated in the presence of the indicated cellular ratios of CD4 + Foxp3 + Treg cells sorted from Foxp3 gfp mice activated in the presence of IFN-g and/or IL-12 as described in ( Although STAT1 activation initiates Th1 cell development, IL-12-dependent STAT4 activation is required for full Th1 cell differentiation. Indeed, STAT4 and T-bet have distinct, yet overlapping functions in establishing the Th1 cell-specific gene expression program. For instance, STAT4 induces the high level of T-bet expression necessary for the terminal differentiation of Th1 effector cells, and activated STAT4 synergizes with T-bet to drive expression of IFN-g (Thieu et al., 2008; Mullen et al., 2001) . Similarly, IL-12 controls the level of T-bet expression in CD8 + effector T cells and dictates whether CD8 + T cells become ''short-lived effector cells'' or long-lived ''memory-precursor effector cells'' (Joshi et al., 2007) . Consistent with their lack of ex vivo IL-12 responsiveness, T-bet + CXCR3 + Treg cells express 5-to 10-fold less T-bet than fully differentiated Th1 cells and do not produce IFN-g (Koch et al., 2009 ). Moreover, we show that they lack expression of other STAT4 regulated genes, and thus we conclude that these Treg cells have undergone a form of incomplete Th1 cell differentiation driven by activation of STAT1 but not STAT4.",

            "text": "Despite being a key checkpoint in Th1 cell development, the molecular control of Il12Rb2 expression is still poorly understood. Although its expression after STAT1 activation is T-bet dependent, it is unclear whether T-bet acts directly on the Il12rb2 locus. Notably, a number of IFN-g activation site (GAS) elements are found upstream of the Il12rb2 coding sequence, indicating that expression of this gene may be directly regulated by STAT1 (Letimier et al., 2007) . Moreover, IL-12-dependent STAT4 activation can feed-forward and enhance Il12rb2 expression (Becskei and Grusby, 2007) . In addition, TCR stimulation alone results in recruitment of the Brg1-containing BAF chromatin remodeling complex to the Il12rb2 locus, which promotes histone hyperacetylation and potentiates STAT-induced Il12rb2 expression (Letimier et al., 2007) . However, the presence of abundant H3K27me3 histone modifications at the Il12rb2 promoter probably acts to temporally delay IL-12Rb2 induction in Treg cells until H3K27 demethylases such as Jumonji 3 can be recruited and remove this chromatin mark (De Santa et al., 2007) . Although Foxp3 is a potent transcriptional repressor, it is not found at or near the Il12rb2 locus (Zheng et al., 2007; Marson et al., 2007) , and deletion of Foxp3 in established Treg cells does not result in Il12rb2 upregulation (Williams and Rudensky, 2007) . In addition, IL-12 can potently induce IFN-g production from TGF-b-induced Treg cells in vitro (Feng et al., 2011) , which are believed to retain a greater degree of phenotypic and functional plasticity than the in vivo-derived natural Treg cells we examined. Thus, repression of Il12rb2 expression appears to be part of the Foxp3-independent program of Treg cell differentiation, and further studies are needed to establish the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate Il12rb2 expression in effector and regulatory T cells.",

However, acquisition of IL-12 responsiveness after prolonged STAT1 activation predicts that Treg cells would be more susceptible to functional reprogramming during sustained or dysregulated inflammatory responses. Accordingly, we observed that IL-12 potentiated production of IFN-g and decreased the suppressive function of IFN-g pretreated Treg cells. Moreover, unlike the transient IL-12 production we observed during L. monocytogenes infection, sustained IL-12 production during the lethal intestinal inflammation caused by oral infection with Toxoplasma is associated with functional reprogramming of Treg cells into IFN-g-producing Th1-like cells (Oldenhove et al., 2009) , and IFN-g-producing Treg cells are also found in the CNS during chronic corona-virus-induced encephalomyelitis (Zhao et al., 2011) . Finally, consistent with our results indicating that sustained STAT1 activation renders Treg cells susceptible to IL-12-mediated functional reprogramming, IFN-g production is observed in Treg cells displaying elevated STAT1 activation due to loss of the microRNA miR-146a (Lu et al., 2010) . Thus, although Foxp3 has been reported to inhibit expression of IFN-g by Treg cells (Ono et al., 2007) , IL-12 appears to be sufficient to overcome this blockade, and impaired IL-12Rb2 induction helps limit the functional reprogramming of Treg cells during Th1 cell inflammation. This also provides a molecular mechanism that helps reconcile conflicting data regarding the susceptibility of Treg cells to functional reprogramming in resolving versus chronic inflammatory conditions (Oldenhove et al., 2009; Rubtsov et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011) .",
