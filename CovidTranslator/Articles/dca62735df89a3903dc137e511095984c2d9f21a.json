The ship had departed from Sydney on a 10-day cruise in the Pacifi c Ocean on May 16 (cruise A) and stopped at 2 islands, neither of which had reported circulation of pandemic infl uenza virus. None of the sick passengers had been in countries known to be affected by this infl uenza strain in the week before boarding.

This advice was communicated to passengers on the day of disembarkation through media alerts, the NSW Health website, and telephone information lines. Subsequently, passengers were contacted by telephone to ensure that they understood containment measures (how to prevent virus spread). Oseltamivir treatment (75 mg 2\u00d7/d for 5 days) was recommended for passengers or crew members with ILI (defi ned as >2 of the following: cough, fever, runny nose, or blocked nose) within 48 hours of onset and oseltamivir prophylaxis Outbreaks of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and Seasonal Infl uenza A (H3N2) on Cruise Ship (75 mg 1\u00d7/d for 10 days) for those in close contact with patients with laboratory-confi rmed cases. On May 25, all crew members were assessed for illness. Symptomatic members were isolated on shore, and the rest were given oseltamivir prophylaxis and continued to serve on the ship's next voyage (cruise B), which departed later the same day. Cruise B traveled along the northern coast of Australia for 7 days and made a short stop at Brisbane before returning to Sydney on June 1. To minimize the risk for infection, enhanced cleaning regimens were conducted before cruise B, and NSW Health sent a public health doctor on the cruise to conduct intense surveillance for symptomatic passengers and crew.",

Consistent with fi ndings in other studies, the symptoms of pandemic and seasonal infl uenza were similar (9-12). After adjusting for underlying medical conditions, we found that hospitalization rates and activity-limiting effects were higher for case-patients with seasonal than with pandemic infl uenza; however, this fi nding may be explained in part by differences in the agespecifi c attack rates. The secondary attack rate for pandemic infl uenza among cabin contacts of 55% was higher than that reported for household contacts (13, 14) , despite a small proportion of these persons having received antiviral drug prophylaxis, and may refl ect the close living arrangements in a ship's cabin. The intense passenger follow-up enabled us to assess the sensitivity of the ship's medical clinic for identifying infl uenza cases. Before this outbreak, ships had active containment measures in place to minimize the spread of seasonal infl uenza, including use of point-of-care infl uenza testing for patients seeking treatment for ILI and oseltamivir treatment and isolation to reduce further spread. Our active case-fi nding efforts identifi ed 79 infl uenza cases on cruise A, yet the ship's clinic identifi ed only 6 (8%) of these. Despite enhanced community awareness of the emerging pandemic, the ship's medical clinic staff underestimated the case count by 13-fold. The number of passengers who sought treatment at the ship's medical clinic does not accurately refl ect the extent of the infl uenza outbreak on board, possibly because the decision to seek treatment may have been infl uenced by a number of factors including cost, severity of symptoms, and unwillingness to be isolated while on holiday.",

            "text": "Our investigation had several limitations. First, the case defi nition depended on NAT detection of virus in clinical samples, which may have resulted in misclassifi cation of cases. Second, although the epidemiology is consistent with the fi rst cases of pandemic infl uenza appearing in the childcare center, undetected or asymptomatic infected passengers or crew could have carried the viruses onto the ship. However, this scenario is unlikely because the symptoms developed in the index case-patient 2 days after embarkation. Third, although most ill passengers were interviewed within 2 days after onset of illness, interviews about severity, length of illness, and the experience in isolation and quarantine were conducted some weeks later, introducing possible recall bias. Fourth, although 2 cases of co-infection were detected, only the fi rst 2 pandemic infl uenza-positive specimens from childcare attendees were subtyped for other infl uenza A subtypes; it is possible that some of the remaining pandemic infl uenza case-patients were also infected with seasonal infl uenza. Fifth, some of the remaining pandemic infl uenza case-patients may have been co-infected. Sixth, the secondary attack rate for cabin contacts may be an overestimate because passengers with negative NAT results were not tested for other respiratory infections, and passengers with onset of symptoms >24 hours after symptoms developed in a cabinmate were assumed to be secondary, rather than co-primary cases.",

In some countries, isolation and quarantine measures have been used in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (15) (16) (17) (18) , but these measures have rarely been used for infl uenza control. In the infl uenza outbreaks reported here, direct follow-up of passengers in isolation and quarantine, supported by intense media coverage, resulted in a high degree of compliance and successful outbreak containment. Additionally, providing oseltamivir prophylaxis for crew members may have contributed to the successful containment of the infection during cruise B. Although the robust application of containment measures can stop the spread of novel infl uenza viruses, public health resource requirements are labor-intensive and expensive and may not be sustainable except for the most virulent of pandemic viruses.
