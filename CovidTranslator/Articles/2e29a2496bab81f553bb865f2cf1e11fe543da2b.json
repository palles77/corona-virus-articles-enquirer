In Australia, fruit-bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) have been identified as the natural host of Hendra virus, a novel and potentially fatal zoonotic virus responsible for mortality or morbidity in about 80 horses and 7 humans since it was first described in 1994 (Murray et al. 1995; Halpin et al. 2000) . Understanding Hendra virus infection dynamics in flying-foxes and the contributing risk factors is fundamental to elaborating the disease ecology of the virus and thus effective exposure risk management in horses and humans. Previous studies have suggested that a range of physiological and ecological factors constitute risk factors for Hendra virus infection in flyingfoxes Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2011) , including physiological stress associated with reproduction and sub-optimal nutritional (Plowright et al. 2008) . However, to rigorously investigate the putative association between stress and Hendra virus infection dynamics in flyingfoxes, a robust method of measuring stress in free-living flying-foxes is needed.",

However, little work has been done on glucocorticoid dynamics in flying-foxes and there are currently few recognised approaches to measuring hormone levels and interpreting changes in terms of physiological stress.

Bats were captured pre-dawn in mist nets (20 m wide 9 4 m deep) hoist between two 12 m aluminium masts, as they returned to the roost. Each bat was quickly removed from the net, and immediately anaesthetised (under veterinary supervision) using the inhalation agent isoflurane and medical oxygen, as described by Jonsson et al. (2004) . Within 3 min of capture, 1 mL of blood was collected from the marginal wing (cephalic) vein into a 1.3 mL lithium heparin blood tube (Sarstedt product number 2269201), and a urine sample was sought by transabdominal palpation and gentle manual bladder expression. Blood samples were stored on ice bricks for up to 3 h before being centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 rpm and the plasma yield collected. Blood glucose was measured using an ACCU-CHEK Performa TM glucometer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Post-anaesthetic, each bat was monitored until conscious, placed into a pillowcase which was tied to a horizontal line (allowing natural inverted roosting posture), and allowed to hang quietly for 60-90 min, when the above blood and urine sample collections were repeated. Following the second collection, animals were again monitored until conscious, placed into a pillowcase and allowed to recover for at least 30 min before being released at the roost site. All samples were stored on ice bricks or refrigerated at 5\u00b0C until shipment on ice bricks to the laboratory. At the laboratory, samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until processing.",

Urine samples were consistently collected at dawn, expected to be at the low point of glucocorticoid production in the diurnal phase of the circadian rhythm of flying-foxes, as shown by Widmaier and Kunz (1993) . The significant increase in plasma cortisol levels that we detected 60-90 min post-capture indicates a typical capture stress response, and establishes that the assay is effectively measuring cortisol (Fig. 3) . The elevated values that we detected are similar to those reported by Reeder et al. (2006) in the Malayan flying-fox (Pteropus vampyrus). Blood glucose also increased showing the typical physiological gluconeogenesis response to stress (Fig. 5) . Urinary cortisol increase, demonstrated in other species to have a greater lag time than plasma cortisol increase, was also detectable 60-90 min post-capture (Fig. 4) , thus validating the assay's ability to detect a physiological response to stress in both plasma and urine.",

This variation is not unexpected, and is likely due to physiological differences between individuals, species and times of urine collection, the latter plausibly reflecting available food and water resources at that time. In addition, the pooled nature of the samples means that each sample potentially contains urine from multiple bats of various physiological and nutritional status. However, for valid comparison and interpretation, it is essential to ensure that hormone concentrations are corrected for concentration of urine. This has typically been done by correcting measured cortisol concentration based on urinary creatinine concentration, which is constant in urine. Miller et al. (2004) used USG to measure urine concentration and found it as reliable as creatinine in human populations. We trialled both approaches and found little difference between the two methods. Thus, we chose to use USG to correct urinary cortisol measurements, because it was a simpler, faster and more cost efficient method.",

P. scapulatus showed a narrower urinary cortisol range than the other species, but higher geometric mean values. These statistics provide an insight into urinary cortisol variability between species, as well as within species, and fill a significant knowledge gap, both for ecological studies and for captive population health management. However, the data should be regarded as indicative of, rather than defining, actual population parameters, given they are derived from pooled samples containing variable volumes of urine from individual bats of variable physiological characteristics. We propose to further investigate species differences in cortisol levels, and any relationship with physiological and general health parameters. Analytical validations of the cortisol EIA demonstrated parallelism and high levels of accuracy, the latter demonstrated by the linearity between dilutions of cortisol standards in buffer compared with dilutions of the standards in the urine and plasma matrix, and acceptable recovery of cortisol standards from urine and plasma matrix. As these validations demonstrated no interfering effect of the plasma or urine matrix on the assay at the dilutions employed in this study, it was not necessary to purify either urine or plasma samples for assay in order to perform the physiological validation.",

The approach also provides a means to explore underlying seasonal trends in population cortisol levels.

In the process, we have demonstrated a typical post-capture stress response in wild flying-foxes, established population-level urinary cortisol ranges for the four Australian mainland species, and established USG as an attractive alternative to creatinine to correct urine concentration. The approach has direct application as a research or clinical tool for flying-fox populations, but equally importantly, has broader application to other freeliving colonial wildlife species. Future research needs to target seasonal variability and chronic stress scenarios.",
