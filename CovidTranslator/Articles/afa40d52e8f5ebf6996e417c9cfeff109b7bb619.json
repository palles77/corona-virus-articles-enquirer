In addition to providing useful information for the poultry industry and allowing insights into the evolution of the adaptive immune system, the simplicity of the chicken MHC has allowed the discovery of phenomena that are more difficult to discern in the more complicated mammalian systems. This review discusses the new concept that poorly expressed promiscuous class I alleles act as generalists to protect against a wide variety of infectious pathogens, while highly expressed fastidious class I alleles can act as specialists to protect against new and dangerous pathogens.",

The human MHC does have many strong genetic associations with autoimmune disease, but the reported associations with infectious disease are much weaker [2, 12] . In essence, it has taken the best immunologists, epidemiologists, and geneticists decades to provide convincing evidence for such genetic associations.

Initially, these associations were with responses to oncogenic viral diseases such as Marek's disease and Rous sarcoma, with the B locus determining life or death for individual chickens.

Moreover, no recombination within the BF-BL region has been observed in experiments [19] [20] [21] [22] , although comparison of haplotypes shows that there has been some recombination over unknown spans of time [23] [24] [25] . Also, the genes involved in peptide loading (tapasin, TAP, and DM) are all highly polymorphic, with each BF-BL haplotype generally having a unique set of alleles [24, [26] [27] [28] . The monomorphic DR-like class II A gene (BLA) is located some 5 cM away [29] , the monomorphic b 2 -microglobulin (b 2 m) gene is on a different chromosome [30, 31] , and inducible proteasome (LMP/PSMB) genes have not been found in the genome [32] . Thus, the polymorphic classical class I and class II B genes are in strong linkage disequilibrium with polymorphic peptide-loading genes, leading to relatively stable MHC haplotypes of polymorphic coevolving genes [33, 34] .",

This situation allows a multigene family of class I genes all of which are (or can be, for HLA-C) relatively well expressed.

In chickens, the single dominantly expressed class I molecule either finds a protective peptide from a particular pathogen or does not, and this life-and-death difference between haplotypes reads out as strong genetic association ( Figure 2) .

            "text": "The organization originally discovered for chickens is likely to be the ancestral one. The genes for antigen processing, peptide loading, and antigen presentation are not closely related so they did not evolve by gene duplication and acquisition of new functions. Instead, unrelated genes coevolved to work together as a pathway, and such coevolution is favored by close linkage. In other words, the genes of the class I system, and by extension the class II system, T cell receptors, and natural killer (NK) cell receptors, are likely to have emerged in one region, a primordial MHC, that has been falling apart ever since [6, 9] . In support of this notion, genes found in various locations around the genome of mammals are found in or near the MHC of nonmammalian vertebrates. For example, the genes for an NK cell receptor and putative ligand (BNK and Blec, like NKR-P1 and LLT1/clr) are found in the chicken MHC rather than in the region syntenic to the NK complex (NKC) as in mammals [16, 52] . Altogether the typical human MHC haplotype confers more or less resistance to most pathogens, a situation that reads out as a weak genetic association (since there is not much difference between haplotypes). (B) By contrast, the single dominantly expressed class I molecule encoded by the chicken MHC can have a fastidious peptide motif that may or may not find a protective peptide from any given pathogen, a situation that reads out as strong genetic associations (since there can be enormous differences between haplotypes). (C) However, the single dominantly expressed class I molecule encoded by the chicken MHC can have a promiscuous peptide motif capable of binding a wide variety of peptides (much like the multigene family of human class I molecules acting together). Comparison of two promiscuous alleles may read out as a weak genetic association (since there is not much difference between them) but comparison of a fastidious allele with a promiscuous allele in chickens may give strong genetic associations.

The close linkage within the class I region leads to a single dominantly expressed class I gene (red) whose peptide motif reflects the specificities of the polymorphic antigen-processing and peptide-loading genes (all red) with which it coevolves. Middle panel. A genomic inversion can lead to the class III region moving between the single dominantly expressed class I gene and the rest of the MHC, marooning the particular alleles of the antigen-processing and peptideloading genes near the class II genes and far from the class I allele that they serve. Bottom panel. The antigen-processing and peptide-loading genes are selected to support any class I allele that might appear due to recombination (rainbow color), which would then allow duplication within an MHC haplotype to give a multigene family encoding class I molecules with different peptide motifs (red, green, blue), as is found in typical mammals. Regions separated by thin vertical lines; genes indicated by thicker vertical lines; tpn, tapasin; TAP, transporter associated with antigen presentation; LMP, inducible proteasome component, originally known as low molecular weight protein; C2, complement component 2; C4, complement component 4; fB, factor B. Modified from [9] . an oncogenic herpes virus with a complex life cycle and significant evolution of virulence in historic times, has been an enormous economic problem [54] . It was unclear how the MHC might confer susceptibility, since any class I molecule would be expected to bind a protective peptide from at least one of the 100 MDV genes. However, MHC haplotypes like B19 were strongly associated with susceptibility while B2 and B21 were strongly associated with resistance [55] .",

By contrast, the BF2 molecules from resistant haplotypes can bind an exceedingly large variety of peptides and might be called promiscuous, with relaxed peptide motifs and wide peptide repertoires [38, 57] . For instance, the molecule BF2*21:01 remodels the binding site to accommodate three anchor residues, at peptide positions P 2 , P c-2 , and P c , with nearly every amino acid found at P 2 and P c-2 [38, 57] . Other chicken class I molecules, like BF2*02:01 and BF2*14:01, use broad binding pockets capable of accommodating many amino acids with hydrophobic side chains, which are particularly common in most proteins [57] .",

It seems most likely that the number of molecules arriving on the cell surface is determined by the interaction of the particular TAP, tapasin, and BF2 alleles in the peptide-loading complex. The underlying reason for this mechanism might simply be the biochemistry of peptide loading, but alternatively there could be evolutionary selection for the inverse correlation. One hypothesis is that promiscuous BF2 molecules present so many self-peptides that negative selection would deplete too many T cell clones in the thymus and that reducing cell-surface expression would reduce the extent of negative selection, with a balance of peptide repertoire and cellsurface expression resulting in an optimal T cell repertoire [57] . Several other hypotheses can be imagined, including a balance between the responses to pathogens for protection versus the recognition of self that could lead to autoimmunity, or the balance between antigen presentation for T cell recognition versus a role as a ligand for NK cells.",

Obviously, the potential contributions of polymorphism in TAP and tapasin cannot extend to mammals that have monomorphic antigen-processing and peptide-loading genes. However, the linkages of peptide repertoire, cell-surface expression, translocation to the cell surface, stability, and resistance to a viral disease are found for human class I molecules. Striking differences were reported in the predicted peptide repertoire of four HLA-B alleles that correlated with the speed of progression from HIV infection to AIDS, with the fastidious HLA-B*57:01 and HLA-B*27:05 alleles associated with long-term non-progression compared with the promiscuous HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*35:01 associated with rapid progression [59] . Subsequently, the cell-surface expression levels of these four HLA-B alleles were shown to vary inversely with peptide repertoire, mirroring the findings in chickens [57] . Measurements of direct peptide binding for 27 HLA-A and HLA-B alleles showed a wide range of peptide repertoires [60] . An early immunoprecipitation study reported that one HLA-A and six HLA-B alleles were mostly in a peptide-bound conformation while seven HLA-A and three HLA-B alleles were mostly bound to TAP molecules, suggesting a range of peptide-loading efficiencies [61] . Assays with transfected cDNA clones for 27 HLA-B alleles show that some alleles have strong tapasin dependence on cell-surface expression (tapasin-independent alleles generally being correlated with faster HIV progression) [62] , implicating dependence on translocation to the cell surface as in chickens [35] . Although the data are not strictly comparable between all of these reports, wider peptide repertoire, lower cell-surface expression level, longer TAP binding, tapasin independence of translocation, and faster HIV progression for HLA-A and HLA-B alleles seem to be broadly (but not perfectly) correlated [63] , with many (but not all) HLA-A molecules being more promiscuous and many (but not all) HLA-B molecules being more fastidious. Overall, the similarities between chickens and humans suggest that these are fundamental properties of classical class I molecules.",

Similarly, the fastidious HLA-B*57:01 specifies amino acids for only two pockets, one of which requires the rare amino acid tryptophan whereas the other allows the common amino acids alanine, serine and threonine. By contrast, the highly fastidious chicken class I molecule BF2*04:01 requires the binding of relatively rare acidic amino acids in each of three pockets [37, 56, 66] .

In any case, human tapasin and TAP genes are functionally monomorphic, so any effect in the peptide-loading complex would depend on the polymorphic positions in the class I allele [42] [43] [44] . By contrast, chicken tapasin and TAP genes are all polymorphic and appear to coevolve with the dominantly expressed class I BF2 gene [26, 27] , so the interactions could be more complex.",

            "text": "HLA-C presents a special challenge, perhaps because the relative importance of various sequence features remains controversial. HLA-C molecules are found expressed on the surface of most cells at a much lower level than HLA-A and HLA-B (perhaps commensurate with a greater role for HLA-C as a ligand for NK cells rather than as an antigen presentation molecule for T cells) [67] . In addition, HLA-C alleles vary in their cell-surface expression (with higher expression correlated with slower HIV progression, perhaps due to T cell recognition) [14, 68, 69] . Various features of HLA-C have been reported to contribute to these two kinds of differences, including: promoter sequence and transcription; miRNA sites in the 3 0 UTR sequences and RNA stability; b 2 m association, peptide motif, and peptide repertoire; and TAP residency and translocation to the surface [67, [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] . In early studies [61, 70] , certain HLA-C alleles were found to be present inside the cell at the same level as HLA-A and HLA-B molecules but remained bound to TAP and were not translocated to the cell surface, similar to promiscuous chicken class I alleles. The available data from predicted or actual peptide motifs is often interpreted to show a limited number of peptides that can bind HLA-C molecules compared with typical HLA-A and HLA-B molecules [67, [74] [75] [76] . A more recent report [76] compares two HLA-C alleles, confirming that several features of the HLA-C gene contribute in a complex way to cell-surface expression. The peptide-binding domains of one HLA-C allele that binds a greater diversity of peptides are better expressed at the cell surface (at least when fused to another class I molecule), the opposite of that found for chicken class I molecules. How all of these observations fit together is currently unknown.",

Looking through the literature, it appears that the promiscuous BF2 alleles protect chickens against a range of common infectious diseases in addition to Marek's disease [77] [78] [79] [80] . Among several examples (Figure 4) , typing chickens in rural Thailand after an outbreak of avian influenza found that all B21 homozygotes survived, that all chickens homozygous for the B12, B13, and B15 haplotypes with fastidious BF2 molecules died, and that, in all but one combination, heterozygotes with one promiscuous class I allele survived [79] . It appears that promiscuous BF2 molecules, combining the specificities of several fastidious molecules in one molecule, generally confer protection against most pathogens (Figure 2 ), much like a mammalian MHC haplotype with multiple mammalian class I molecules. By contrast, the fastidious human class I alleles HLA-B*57:01 and HLA-B*27:05 confer protection against the dangerous zoonotic pathogen HIV, which they achieve by binding a particular protective peptide that the virus cannot change without a drastic loss of fitness [13, 59, 81, 82] . Another dangerous and possibly new pathogen, hepatitis C virus (HCV), is also controlled by HLA-B*27:05 [83, 84] .",

            "text": "How does this new view stack up against the current concepts and available data? The many class I alleles found in most human populations have long been interpreted to mean that high levels of polymorphism are important for survival. However, a population with a few generalist alleles may provide enough protection under normal circumstances. If this is true, the current view that MHC typing can identify the risk of extinction for endangered species [85] may need to be reconsidered to also take into account the peptide repertoire of MHC molecules present in the remaining population. It is also easy to imagine that the original class I alleles were promiscuous, which seems superficially similar to the class II molecules from which they may have arisen [6, 9, 86] . The major change in structure-function relationships caused by rearrangement of the MHC in the lineage leading to placental mammals discussed above [6, 9, 27] might have been facilitated by a promiscuous class I allele closely linked to promiscuous TAP genes. Fastidious alleles might arise by a few mutations from promiscuous alleles and remain at a low gene frequency unless selected by a pathogen challenge and might diminish in frequency once that challenge is relaxed. However, it is also possible that a selective sweep ensures the near fixation of fastidious alleles. Chimpanzees, which are thought to have been strongly selected during a retroviral catastrophe, have two kinds of class I molecules [87] [88] [89] : those with fastidious peptide motifs similar to HLA-B*57:01 and HLA-B*27:05 and those with promiscuous motifs similar to BF2*02:01. Finally, it is important to note that the classification of generalist and specialist alleles may be more useful for the explanation of a population response to a given pathogen than for individual predictions: a promiscuous molecule may be able to protect against a new and virulent pathogen (as does HLA-B*35:01 for HIV clade C but not B [13] ) while most fastidious molecules will be unlikely to recognize a protective peptide for any one particular pathogen. However, a potential advantage might arise from bundling together alleles that are promiscuous or fastidious, allowing greater statistical power in genetic association studies.",

If the broad correlations discussed here are confirmed, a comprehensive reassessment of the extent to which (low-expression) promiscuous and (highexpression) fastidious class I alleles confer protection against various kinds of pathogens (as well as correlating with other biological and medical phenomena) would be valuable. diameter of each circle indicates the frequency of a particular MHC allele in a population before and after selection by a pathogen. The rainbow colors indicate promiscuous molecules that act as generalists, conferring protection against most pathogens including those regularly found in the environment. The single colors indicate fastidious molecules encoded by genes that arise by mutation and are present at low frequency but with the possibility of presenting a protective peptide from a particular pathogen. Scenarios for three different pathogens are shown: one of the generalist molecules confers protection against the first pathogen (top); one of the specialist molecules confers protection against the second pathogen (middle); and another of the specialist molecules confers protection against the third pathogen (bottom).
