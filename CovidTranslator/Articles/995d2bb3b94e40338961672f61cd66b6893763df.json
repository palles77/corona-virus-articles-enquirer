Previous studies demonstrated that SVV 3C pro suppresses innate immune responses by cleavage of host proteins and degradation of IRF3 and IRF7 protein expression. Here, we showed that SVV 3C protease (3C pro ) has deubiquitinating activity. Overexpressed 3C pro inhibits the ubiquitination of cellular substrates, acting on both lysine-48-and lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains. SVV infection also possessed deubiquitinating activity. The ubiquitin-proteasome system was significantly involved in SVV replication. Furthermore, 3C pro inhibited the ubiquitination of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), thereby blocking the expression of interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 and IFN stimulated gene 54 (ISG54) mRNAs. A detailed analysis revealed that mutations (H48A, C160A, or H48A/C160A) that ablate the Cys and His residues of 3C pro abrogated its deubiquitinating activity and the ability of 3C pro to block IFN-\u03b2 induction.",

At 24 h post-transfection (hpt), the ubiquitinated cellular proteins was assessed by western blotting. The SVV 2A, 2C, and 3C pro inhibited the level of ubiquitinated cellular proteins, and 3C pro most significantly inhibited this process ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Human DUBs are classified into five subfamilies based on their catalytic domains structures. They have a high degree of homology in the two regions known as Cys and His boxes that surround the catalytic Cys and His residues (Nijman et al., 2005) . Similar to other picornaviruses, SVV 3C pro also possesses a conserved catalytic box with Cys and His residues (Qian et al., 2017) . Therefore, the SVV 3C pro was selected for further studies. To determine whether 3C pro functions as a DUB, HEK293T cells were transfected with increasing amounts of plasmid encoding 3C pro along with HA-Ub or empty vector. At 24 hpt, the effect of 3C pro on all https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.10.028 Received 13 July 2018; Received in revised form 26 September 2018; Accepted 31 October 2018 ubiquitinated cellular proteins was assessed by western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A , expression of 3C pro resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the level of ubiquitinated cellular proteins compared with that in the empty vector-transfected cells. To further determine which Ub linkage type is targeted by 3C pro , HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-K63-Ub or FLAG-K48-Ub in lieu of HA-Ub. At 24 hpt, the cells were collected for western blotting. Both K48-and K63-linked Ub chains were also processed by 3C pro in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 1  B and C) .",

To date, many cellular Ub ligase enzymes can regulate these processes. For example, the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF128 or Nrdp1 directly enhance ubiquitination of TBK1, which facilitates the activation of TBK1 (Song et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2009) . Meanwhile, many cellular DUBs negatively regulate type I IFN signaling pathways. For example, USP3, USP38, and USP19 target RIG-I, TBK1, and TRAF3 for deubiquitination, respectively, thereby blocking the activation of type I IFN signaling pathways (Cui et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2016) . DUB activity also has been demonstrated in many bacteria and viruses, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, FMDV, PRRSV, herpesviruses, coronaviruses, and bunyaviruses, and DUB Fig. 3 . SVV 3C pro inhibits the ubiquitination of cellular proteins in a manner that is dependent on its DUB activity.

The abundance of RIG-I, TBK1, and TRAF3 were compared at 0, 6, and 12 h after SVV infection. The results showed that SVV infection had no impact on the abundance of RIG-I and TRAF3, but did inhibit expression of TBK1 (Fig. 5D) . It is well known that reduction of the K48-linked polyubiquitin can stabilize TBK1. However, our results indicated that SVV or 3C pro reduced expression of TBK1. To clarify this unexpected result, a broad-range deubiquitinase inhibitor, PR-619 (Sigma-Aldrich), was selected for further study (Altun et al., 2011) . The ubiquitination levels of endogenous K48 for TBK1 was enhanced after PR-619 incubation ( Supplementary Fig.2 ). HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-3Cexpressing plasmid or infected with SVV (MOI 1). Then, the cells were treated with or without PR-619. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting. The expression of TBK1 in the 3C pro -transfected and SVV-infected cells was enhanced comparing with that in the PR-619-treated cells (Fig. 5E ), which indicated that 3C-induced reduction of the K48linked polyubiquitin of TBK1 enhanced the expression of TBK1. However, as a whole, 3C pro and SVV still reduced the expression of TBK1. SVV 3C pro possesses protease activity. Therefore, we speculated that 3C pro reduced the expression of TBK1 by its protease activity, and 3C pro partly stabilized TBK1 by its DUB activity.",

HEK293T cells grown in 24-well plates were co-transfected with 0.1 \u03bcg/well of the plasmid IFN-\u03b2-Luciferase (IFN-\u03b2-Luc) along with 0.01 \u03bcg/well of plasmid pRL-TK and plasmids encoding FLAG-RIG-I, Myc-TBK1, FLAG-3Cwt, FLAG-3Cdm, or empty vector. At 24 hpt, the cells were lysed and analyzed with a Dual-specific Luciferase Assay kit. As shown in Fig. 5F , RIG-I-, and TBK1-mediated IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity was reduced in the presence of FLAG-3Cwt but not FLAG-3Cdm. To further confirm this effect, we conducted a qPCR analysis to determine the levels of the RIG-I-and TBK1-mediated endogenous transcription of the IFN-\u03b2 and ISG54 genes. The results showed that FLAG-3Cwt also inhibits RIG-I-and TBK1-induced IFN-\u03b2 and ISG54 mRNA expression (Fig. 5G) , which is in accordance with previous findings showing that SVV 3C pro significantly inhibited the endogenous transcription of the IFN-\u03b2 and ISG56 genes that is mediated by RIG-I and TBK1 (Qian et al., 2017) . Taken together, these results indicate that SVV 3C pro promotes replication of SVV and suppresses RIG-I-and TBK1induced type I IFN production in a manner that is dependent on its DUB activity.",

However, more work will be required to determine if other picornavirus 3C pro , such as encephalomyocarditis virus, enterovirus 71, coxsackievirus A16, or FMDV, have DUB activity. Our data also uncover a novel mechanism by which SVV 3C pro antagonizes type I IFN induction, i.e., by deubiquitinating the critical signaling moleculars RIG-I, TBK1, and TRAF3. Our results comparing various 3C pro mutants suggest that the DUB activity of 3C pro enables it to block induction of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and the Fig. 4 . SVV 3C pro inhibits the ubiquitination of RIG-I, TBK1, and TRAF3. HEK-293T cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes, and the monolayer cells were cotransfected with 2 \u03bcg HA-Ub-expressing plasmid, 1 \u03bcg FLAG-3Cwt-expressing plasmid, 1 \u03bcg FLAG-3Cdm-expressing plasmid, and the RIG-I (A), TBK1 (B), or TRAF3 (C) expression plasmids (4 \u03bcg). MG132 (20 nM) was added at 30 hpt. Cell lysates were prepared at 2 h after treatment and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibody, and the Ub conjugation of the proteins was detected by western blotting with anti-HA antibody. The input tagged proteins were detected with the indicated antibodies. (D) HEK-293T cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes, and the monolayer cells were transfected with 5 \u03bcg FLAG-3C-expressing plasmid or empty vector. At 32 hpt, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-RIG-I antibody and analyzed by western blotting. The whole-cell lysates and IP antibody-antigen complexes were analyzed by IB using anti-FLAG and anti-RIG-I antibodies.

Studies have indicated that SVV 3C pro mutants that abrogate Cys and His residues lost protease activity (Qian et al., 2017; Xue et al., 2018) . Here, our results indicated that SVV 3C pro mutants that abrogate Cys and His residues also lost DUB activity. Therefore, we speculate that the Cys and His residues of SVV 3C pro may contribute to both protease and DUB activities. 3C pro might suppress type I IFN response by different mechanisms in host cells. SVV has been identified as a novel oncolytic virus against several human cancers (Burke, 2016) . Ubiquitination and deubiquitination are mechanisms that also play important roles in regulation of cancer (Kaushal et al., 2018) . Whether SVV can inhibit cancer progression through 3C pro DUB activity is still unclear and will need to be investigated in future studies. It may provide a novel method for cancer therapy.",
