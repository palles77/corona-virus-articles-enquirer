The integrity of the intestinal epithelium is maintained by tight junctions (TJs), adherens junctions (AJs), desmosomes, and gap junctions. The TJ is the major paracellular barrier and functions to separate apical and basolateral compartments or membranes. The AJ forms a continuous belt between cells and is crucial for the maintenance of intercellular adhesion (Hartsock and Nelson, 2008; Su et al., 2011) . The TJ and AJ are regulated by transmembrane TJ (occludin and claudin) and AJ (E-Cadherin and catenins) proteins on the opposing cells' plasma membranes and interactions mediated by actin binding proteins such as the zonula occludin (ZO) family, which link the AJ complex to actin microfilaments (Hartsock and Nelson, 2008; Su et al., 2011) .",

Epidemic PEDV strains are highly enteropathogenic and acutely infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines, but the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection (Jung and Saif, 2015; Jung et al., 2014) . During the early stages of PEDV infection, necrosis and exfoliation of infected villous epithelial cells is pronounced, resulting in acute, severe villous atrophy. To what extent the integrity and function of the PEDV-infected villous epithelium is restored by intestinal stem cells located at crypt cell layers is currently unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine whether PEDV infection causes structurally altered TJ and AJ in the villous and crypt epithelium of the small and large intestine by immunofluorescence (IF) staining for in situ identification of the related proteins, ZO-1 and E-Cadherin for TJ and AJ, respectively.",

The SPF herd was seronegative for antibodies to PRRSV, PRCV, TGEV and porcine circovirus type 2. Twenty 9-day-old nursing piglets were randomly assigned to one of two groups: PEDV inoculated (n = 9) and Mock (n = 11). Each experimental group of pigs was housed in a separate room in a high-security isolation facility (biosafety level 2). Nursing pigs were inoculated orally [8.9 log 10 GE (%2.9 log 10 plaque forming units)/pig] (Jung et al., 2014) with 1 ml of PC21A or mock inoculated with MEM. Inoculated and negative control pigs (n = 3-4/group at each time-point) were euthanized for pathological examination at an acute-stage (PID 1), at a mid-stage (PID 3), and at a later-stage (PID 5) of infection. After PEDV inoculation, the pigs were monitored for clinical signs 2-3 times daily until necropsy. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Ohio State University approved all protocols related to the animal experiments and care in this study.",

Similar to PEDV infection of intestinal epithelium, TJ and AJ disruption in pulmonary epithelium, which might contribute to the desquamation of the alveolar wall, was observed in lung biopsies from the Betacoronavirus SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-infected macaques and patients (Nicholls et al., 2003) . A previous study suggested that alteration of TJ and AJ may create a breach in the epithelial barrier allowing SARS-CoV to reach the basal matrix and eventually the systemic circulation, i.e. viremia (Teoh et al., 2010) . By similar mechanisms, after PEDV infection, viremia might be caused during acute infection stages, as reported previously (Jung et al., 2014) . In this study, by qRT-PCR, all inoculated nursing pigs tested at PIDs 1-5 also had low to moderate viral RNA titers in serum, ranging from 5.6 to 8.6 log 10 GE/ml.

Whether PEDV can alter TJ or AJ in vivo in the intestinal epithelium of PEDV-infected pigs was uncertain. Our study clearly demonstrated that at PIDs 1-5, PEDV-infected pigs exhibited mildly to extensively disorganized, irregular distribution and reduced expression of ZO-1 or E-Cadherin in villous, but not crypt epithelial cells of the jejunum and ileum, but not in the large intestine, when compared to the negative controls. Structural alterations of TJ and AJ were extensive in the small intestine of PEDV-infected pigs at PIDs 1-3, but then appeared to recover at PID 5, as evident by increased numbers of ZO-1-positive epithelial cells and markedly improved appearance of E-Cadherin-positive villous epithelium of the infected pigs.
