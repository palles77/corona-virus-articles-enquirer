These cells, designated Nj, exhibited typical MHV cytopathic effects (CPE) at all passage levels along with the continua] production of infectious virus. Most cells were positive for viral antigen by immunofluorescence. Viral particles consistent with the morphology of MHV were found by electron microscopy. The uninfected neuroblastoma cell line did not contain a detectable population of cells resistant to JHM, and persistence did not elicit the production of interferon. No plaque morphology or temperature sensitive mutants were selected for in the Nj culture, and we were unable to detect the presence of either a defective or defective interfering virus population. The addition of low concentration antiviral antibody modulated the infection to a carrier culture with viral antigen in the cytoplasm of the cells, but no infectious virus was produced, and the cells lacked both surface viral antigen and CPE. Possible mechanisms of viral persistence in vitro are discussed.",

Intracellular particles which appeared to be devoid of central staining material were found, and negatively stained virions from the Nj culture also appeared to be differentially strained with phosphotungstic acid. Studies were carried out to detect the presence of defective interfering (I)I) or defective particles in the Nj culture. To determine if Nj supernatants contained DI particles, monolayers of 1)BT cells were infected with concentrated Nj supernatants at a M0I of 1 and challenged with JHM at a MOI of 0.05 and 1.0. No difference in superrtatant virus yield was found. Similar experiments using the non-neuro-adapted A59 strain of MHV, which grows to t00-fold higher titer than JHSI as challenge virus, also lailed to show any differenees ill virus yield. Attempts were made using both DBT (7) and 17CL1 (20) cells as hosts to see if DI particles could be generated by undiluted serial passage.

The Nj virus population showed no selection of ts or plaque morphology mutants through the 40th passage. In addition to the parameters already discussed, Nj JHM was tested for another biological property unique to JHM, namely its ability to cause demyelination following i.c. inoculation into susceptible mice. The Nj virus retained this property and produced lesions identical to those caused by the parental virus. Antiviral antibody addition to the Nj culture at passage 19 increased yields of both cell-associated and supernatant virus. Enhancement of Murray Valley encephalitis virus and rabbit pox virus plaque formation has been described in cells treated Mth virM specific antisera (5, 10) . Furthermore, the addition of non-neutralizing antiviral antibody to leucocytes infected ~dth dengue virus enhances virus growth (4) perhaps by increasing virus adsorption to phagocytic cells, thereby increasing the apparent MOI by facilitating entrance of the infections virus into the cell cytoplasm while escaping the defense mechanisms of the phagocyte. In N2A cells no active phagocy~osis of colloidal carbon particles was found. In addition, the Nj culture is refractory to superinfection with JHM virus at passage 16 and beyond. Therefore, we must postulate that the effect of the antibody must not be enhanced viral uptake but a modulation of the cell surface that increases viral synthesis. The syncytia are the most likely cells affected since they are the only cell type with detectable celt surface antigen.",
