Mechanistic simulation modeling that captures the dynamics between patients, pathogens, and the environment is increasingly being used to improve understanding of epidemiological patterns of HAIs and to facilitate decisions on infection prevention and control (IPC). The purpose of this review is to present a systematic review to establish (1) how simulation models have been used to investigate HAIs and their mitigation and (2) how these models have evolved over time, as well as identify (3) gaps in their adoption and (4) useful directions for their future development. Methods: The review involved a systematic search and identification of studies using system dynamics, discrete event simulation, and agent-based model to study HAIs. Results: The complexity of simulation models developed for HAIs significantly increased but heavily concentrated on transmission dynamics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the hospitals of highincome countries. Neither HAIs in other health care settings, the influence of contact networks within a health care facility, nor patient sharing and referring networks across health care settings were sufficiently understood.",

            "text": "cluster RCTs across various health facilities to achieve generalizability and sufficient power to address important research questions is difficult. In addition, although quasi-experimental studies are more feasible and practical to conduct, the lack of randomization is a threat to the internal validity and limits the generalizability of the results to larger populations. 11 Although simpler non-mechanistic modeling approaches, such as statistical models and analytical models, have also been used to evaluate IPC interventions, they cannot capture the complexity and dynamics of HAI transmission and the health care contexts in which the interventions are implemented. Therefore, a more comparable, reliable, and easy-to-use planning tool is needed to assess interventions and their impacts. 12 Modeling is increasingly being used to improve the understanding of epidemiological patterns of HAIs and to facilitate decisions on IPC intervention. Mechanistic simulation modeling that captures the dynamics between patients, pathogens, and the environment is particularly useful for studying complex systems such as the health care system. 13 A simulation model can be used to understand the dynamics of HAIs and IPC and how various complexities influence these dynamics or to predict outcomes of IPC interventions. The latter can only be done credibly provided we understand the system. Simulation modeling provides a risk-free environment in which ideas on IPC strategies can be tested in a systematic manner without the time, costs, and risks associated with experiments conducted in a real-world setting. It is a valuable tool to guide the selection of the most appropriate empirical research to pursue and to examine the effects of IPC strategies, serving as a \"virtual policy laboratory\" for decision support by researchers, policy makers, public health officials, hospital managers and administrators, and other health care decision-makers. 14 Like other modeling methodologies that try to predict outcomes, simulation modeling does not necessarily provide precise results that are completely reliable (eg, the exact number of infections or the precise course of an epidemic). Perfect prediction using simulation can rarely be achieved because it is impossible to build a model that fully replicates the real world, particularly when we describe a stochastic system as complex as infection transmission, which is influenced by human behavior, pathogen and host biological characteristics, and the health facility structure among many factors. Nonetheless, simulation modeling can help us to understand the relative effectiveness of different interventions, identify the risk of HAIs for different population groups, provide confidence intervals on the epidemic behaviors and, therefore, aid with decision making. IPC decision-makers using simulation models for decision-support must consider model assumptions and their relevance to the particular context in addition to carefully weighing the predicted benefits of interventions against the inconvenience, stigmatization, and costs they might engender.",

Flows (or \"rates\") change a stock over time by adding to (inflows) or subtracting from that stock (outflows). SD models are well-known for their ability to depict non-linear relationships, which derive from the existence of feedback processes that exist in which actors within a system will later be affected by their actions. 19 In this review, we also consider compartmental models from the mathematical epidemiology and ecology literature that describe the disease transmission dynamics and link them to aspects of health care facilities and provision of services that effect outcome. These models similarly take a top-down approach that often assumes continuous time, and they are implemented using differential equations. 20 Discrete event simulation (DES)\u2212A process-based simulation method used for modeling the operation of a system as a discrete sequence of activities and events in time, characterizing and analyzing queuing processes and networks of queues, and solving problems of resource use. 21 Events, entities, attributes, and resources are the key components in DES. Entities are passive individual objects that possess attributes. These attributes are unique characteristics or features, such as age and health status. Resources, such as those defined in DES, require time to provide a service to an entity, making other entities wait and form a queue. Entities consume resources while they experience events. However, the consumption of those resources does not depend on individual-level entity behavior. As entities use up resources they are indirectly competing with other entities in the queue. 22 DES allows for capturing the effect of variability, stochasticity, and randomness of multiple elements within a system, but it does not explicitly model feedbacks or interactions between entities. 23 Agent-based model (ABM)\u2212A bottom-up simulation method for modeling dynamic and adaptive systems with autonomous entities called agents and their environment. 24, 25 The agents are described by their properties, actions, decision rules, and possibly goals, and interact with each another and the environment. They live in the environment, and they sense it. They decide what action to employ at a certain time on the basis of their own state, their own defined decision rules and the environment state (including other agents with which they interact). Agents can have explicit targets to minimize or maximize, and they can also learn and adapt based on experience. Agent-agent and agent-environment interactions result in the update of the internal state of the agents or a decision on their next actions. Similarly, the state of the environment can update. As agents and the environment interact and evolve or potentially co-evolve, micro-and macro-level patterns emerge. We also view similar microsimulation and individual-based models from the mathematical epidemiology and ecology literature as ABMs in this review, although in these models the entities are often only reflexive and do not make autonomous decisions.",

Second, because the main purpose of the review was to explore the existing use of simulation modeling for understanding HAI transmission and improving IPC in various health care settings from clinical and economical perspectives, we looked for the following codes: country of research, setting, type of simulation model, research theme, aim of the simulation model, pathogen, and inclusion of economic analysis. Additionally, because we were interested in how models of HAI transmission in health care settings were simulated to evaluate the effectiveness of IPC strategies, data on the type of intervention and the type of interactions (ie, patient-health care worker (HCW), HCW-HCW, patient-patient, patient-visitor, environment reservoir for transmission, interaction between health facilities and interaction between health facility and community) were also extracted. Additionally, to explore how different types of simulation models and hybrid models have been used, we looked into technical perspectives of these models, which included whether sensitivity analysis, simulation software, calibration, validation and verification, transferability, and generalizability were performed and how they were performed. Figure 1 shows the process of identification, screening, and selection using the PRISMA flowchart. 33 There were 606 records identified from electronic database searches and 25 records from other sources. After removing duplicates and reviewing the title and abstract of the remainder, full-text articles were retrieved for the retained 109 records to assess their eligibility. A total of 54 records were removed because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. An additional 13 studies were identified via reference screening of the existing systematic reviews. [15] [16] [17] [18] Overall, 68 publications were included and reviewed in detail. 10, 14, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] 49, 50, [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] Causative organisms modeled Almost one-half of the included studies investigated the dynamics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a health care setting (47%, 38 studies), followed by vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) and Clostridium difficile (CD), with significantly fewer studies (12%, 10 studies and 7%, 6 studies, respectively).

The SD component simulated the changes in the internal pathogen population of each agent, called bacteria population vector over time, which form one of the elements driving the transmission probabilities during events of agent-interactions. This bacteria population vector of each agent defined the colonization or infection status of that agent. The status of the agents affected the transmission of bacteria between agents. Whenever interactions between 2 agents occurred or patient agents received the application or dosage of a specific antibiotic, the SD component was invoked to simulate the dynamics in the bacteria population vector within each agent and update its infection and/or colonization status.

Less than one-half of the studies included sensitivity analysis (47%, 32 studies). Of the studies that conducted a sensitivity analysis using one type of sensitivity analysis, univariate sensitivity analysis was the most common method (24%, 16 studies). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was the second most common method but to a significantly less extent (12%, 8 studies) . PSA is generally regarded as a more rigorous method to explain uncertainty in the joint distribution of parameters, 17 and is recommended in health economic evaluation guidance. 48 In addition, 2 recent studies employed the combination of univariate and multivariate/probabilistic sensitivity analysis to investigate model sensitivity. 49, 50 The number of studies conducting sensitivity analysis and the use of more sophisticated approaches have been increasing in recent years ( Fig. 2A ).",

More than one-third of the included publications did not state any sort of validation (24 studies). Almost onehalf of the simulation models that contained stochastic element (30 studies) were validated by using the single approach of internal validity, in which several simulations were performed to assess their stochastic variability. The lack of consistency in a model's results may cause the appropriateness of the investigated system or the strategy and/or policy to be questionable. 51 Historical data validation, which uses a part of the collected data other than the data used for model building to test if the model behaves as the real system does, 51 was found to be used as the single method of validation in 4 other studies (6%). Other validation methods were rarely used. Recent simulation models combined multiple validation methods to achieve a more thorough validation approach. 37, 39, 42, 49, 50, [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] With respect to the different simulation methods, approximately one-half of SD and hybrid simulation models depicted a validation approach, whereas a higher proportion was observed for the ABM and DES models (ie, 73% and 86%, respectively). More than one-half of the hybrid simulation models that included a validation method used combinations of validation approaches. This number occupied one-third of all of the models using mixed approaches to validation. Only 1 out of a total of 68 studies described how verification was conducted, using good documentation of the model building process, and randomly checking whether the simulated behaviors of selected agents of each type matched the intended behaviors of the conceptual model. 49 ",

The models in this review used a number of calibration approaches: maximum likelihood estimation 58, 59 ; the least-square criterion 60,61 ; Monte Carlo, 39 Markov chain, 49 and combinations of these methods. 35, 40, 50, 52, [62] [63] [64] In particular, McBryde et al 64 used a combination of Bayesian estimation, the Markov chain, and the Monte Carlo for model fitting. Similarly, Sadsad and colleagues 40 combined a scatter search algorithm and a least squares criterion for model calibration.

            "text": "The simulation models of HAIs primarily depicted a single ward setting. 34, 65, 66 Most of the models included in this review simulated transmission of HAIs in an ICU setting (25%, 17 studies) or a simplified hospital setting (32%, 22 studies) of which most lacked any further ward structure (12/22 studies, 55%). General wards were modeled in 5 studies (7%) of which 3 specified a particular type of ward (ie, an out-patient long-term hemodialysis, 66 a dialysis unit, 67 and a vascular unit 54 ). One recent study incorporated various types of hospital wards with a distinct nature into one model, including hospital wards designated as either general care, observation, and step-down, or the hospital wards were characterized as surgical and medical. 50 Additionally, a small number of studies (5 studies, 7%) modeled the transmission dynamics of HAIs in LTCFs for pathogens, such as influenza, 42, 43, 68 MRSA, 69 and viral nosocomial gastroenteritis. 62 Pediatric health facilities were considered in 3 studies. 52, 70, 71 Most of the publications took neither the transfer patterns between health care facilities nor the transmission dynamics within health care settings into consideration although most ward or hospital-based simulation models included did not view the hospital as a closed system (eg, inclusion of hospital admission and discharge rates from and into community). Recently published studies incorporated the interaction between ICUs and general wards, or between general wards within a hospital. 35, 40, 49, 72, 73 Donker et al 74 was the first study to look at the impact of different referral patterns among various categories of hospitals on MRSA infection rates. One year later, 2 additional studies examined the interaction between the settings for MRSA. 38, 75 Further, Lee and colleagues 76,77 explored the transmission of MRSA within a setting in which multiple hospitals, LTCFs, and the community interacted with one another.",

Additionally, the inclusion of contact between the family caregiver and the HCW was a distinct characteristic of the models set up in the neonatal ICU. 52, 70 This type of interaction is of importance and likely to happen within pediatric health care settings in which parents are often (if not always) involved in child care activities.",

However, as models imperfectly represent real systems and are contextually constrained during their development, care needs to be taken when transferring and generalizing an existing model to avoid unintentional misapplication. Most of studies included in this review did not discuss the transferability and generalizability of the developed simulation models (78%, 53 studies). Of the studies that state these aspects, they briefly discussed the possibility of transferring their simulation models to assess HAI transmission dynamics for different pathogens, 34, 36, 40 in different health care settings, 34, 40, 59 and to evaluate the effectiveness of different sets of interventions. 36, 59 However, a methodology for model transferring or generalizing, rather than modification of parameter values, model setup and assumptions, was not clearly explained.",

The problems of HAIs in LMICs in which the burden is significantly higher than HICs are rarely addressed in the literature and particularly in simulation modeling studies. The prevalence of HAIs in LMICs is at least double the prevalence in Europe. 9 Additionally, the incidence of HAIs acquired in ICUs in LMICs triples the incidence in the United States. 94 However, our review found that only a minority of simulation models for HAIs in LMICs were developed.",

Simulation models for HAIs have also become more complex in terms of the settings being modeled. Earlier studies generally modeled a single ward (usually an ICU) or a simplified hospital lacking of any further ward structure whereas more recent studies were likely to incorporate different types of wards (ICUs and general wards), as well as consider the transmission across health facilities (eg, mainly between hospitals), and the community. Future studies could investigate interactions with LTCFs, other types of health care facilities, and the community to provide a more realistic estimate of HAI incidence and prevalence, and the effectiveness of IPC policies. Pediatric settings were rarely considered although pediatric patients have higher rates of viral lower respiratory tract infections and bloodstream infections than adults, especially those younger than 2 years of age and those demanding care in neonatal ICUs and pediatric ICUs. 95 As the most popular transmission routes of infections in health care settings are via the transiently colonized hands of HCWs and/or contaminated medical equipment and the environment, modeling interactions between patient and HCW has dominated this field of research, followed by the environmental reservoir for transmission although to a much lesser extent. Simulation modeling studies have hardly considered direct HCW-to-HCW contact or interactions between visitors/caregivers and patients. Visitors and/or family caregivers can play a very important role in infection transmission in a health facility, especially in settings such as pediatric or geriatric health facilities where patients often need extra care. In many cultures including Asian countries and LMICs, having visitors and caregivers on a regular basis is common practice and sometimes encouraged owing to a considerable shortage of staff and a need to reduce medical costs to patients. 56 Because visitors and caregivers are also more mobile than patients, they are both highly susceptible to contracting infections and potentially able to transmit pathogens to various locations inside and outside as the hospital. 78 When to use which simulation modeling methodology",

SD is suitable for investigating the long-term behavior of the system containing large patient populations, which are considered to be homogenous and therefore aggregated into compartments. 96 Thus, it is useful for macro-level modeling to reflect long-term consequences and discover long-term solutions that may provide effective aids in policy decision making at a high level. Although SD has long been used to analyze HAI dissemination in hospitals and IPC policies, it could not address the spatial detail and microstructure of a health care facility, the complexity and heterogeneity of contact networks within a health care setting and the stochasticity of interactions within such networks. 79 By contrast, ABM has been found to be significantly helpful in overcoming the limitations of SD, which may explain the increasing use to model HAIs in recent years. It is easier and thus preferable for modeling the heterogeneity of a small population like an ICU rather than a large population setting. 97 Health care settings in general and ICUs, in particular, are spatially intricate environments where complex interactions between specific sets of individuals are a key driver of transmission. Not every primary physician, consultant, and nurse see every patient, leading to a highly heterogeneous social and contact network. 36 Diagnostic uncertainty (ie, whether an individual is infected is not always known) also complicates the transmission of HAIs. This accentuates the importance of impacts of stochastic interactions and chance events upon the transmission and spread of HAIs. ABM can also help understand the influence of different patient referring and transferring patterns among health care facilities within a network owing to variations in their geographical locations, policies, services provided and variations in individuals' decision. A limitation of ABM is the requirement of reliable and detailed data for model building and validation, which are not always readily available. 61 Higher levels of behavioral detail produced by ABM causes greater computational intensity, and difficulty in performing model parameterization and extensive uncertainty analyses, which are essential for reliable predictions. As ABM and hybrid models become increasingly popular, the adoption of more sophisticated methods and mixed methods for sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation were more frequently observed in more recently published studies.",

For example, SD is useful in providing a holistic view of the feedback dynamics of HAI transmission in a complex health care system but cannot take account of the heterogeneity of individual patients and HCWs, and the stochasticity resulting from their behaviors and interactions, which are the distinct features of ABM.

            "text": "This review provides an overview of the development and application of systems simulation modeling in HAIs from which gaps of research in this field can be identified. First, the transmission patterns of HAIs in LMICs require further studies because they are likely to be dramatically different from those in HICs owing to many factors such as poor infrastructure, insufficient environmental hygiene conditions, different staff cohorting, shortage of HCWs, the knowledge and compliance of HCWs to IPC measures, overcrowded health care facilities, absence of comprehensive IPC guidelines and policies, lack of procedure, and different antibiotic prescribing and referral patterns. Second, pediatric hospitals and other types of health care setting-like LTCFs, as well as interactions between settings were not extensively investigated. Furthermore, understanding of patient sharing and referring networks among health care facilities driven by operational and financial alliances needs to be improved. Third, the number of studies adopting hybrid simulation models are still limited, possibly because of the unavailability of clear guidelines and frameworks for hybrid model development. Because it is argued that most, if not all, real-world problems tackled with simulation modeling cannot be solved by SD, DES or ABM alone but require a combination of 2 or all of them, a hybrid model resulting from this combination expectedly offers different perspectives of a problem and generate more insights, which will provide better understanding and greater support for decision-making. 100 The use of simulation modeling for economic analysis of different IPC measures and strategies has increased but is still relatively scarce. The application of this methodology to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various IPC strategies is promising in a sense that it can appropriately guide and prioritize the allocation of limited resources and funds. Additionally, an understanding of other kinds of interactions in the health care setting apart from interactions between doctors and/or nurses and patients is insufficient. Last, the evaluation of clinical and cost effectiveness was only conducted for a number of commonly used interventions like hand hygiene, isolation, and screening, further investigation on other IPC measures and a combination of different strategies is imperative to determine best practice in various health care settings. Models can also be developed to simulate coordination and collaboration among health facilities to assess the impact of a regional IPC program.",

It can help guide further development of simulation models, especially hybrid models, to target gaps in knowledge in this field of research. The results of this review indicate that the complexity of simulation models for HAIs, in terms of the level of details of health care settings and interactions being modeled and methodological designs, significantly increased over time; however, the context predominately remained focused on the transmission dynamics of MRSA in hospitals in HICs, rather than in other types of health care settings, such as LTCFs or in LMICs. Additionally, the overview of existing simulation models in HAIs can facilitate and direct researchers to useful areas for further research such as transmission of HAIs in health care settings other than hospitals and across different types of settings. Further development and application of hybrid simulation models could help to secure further insights into HAIs.",
