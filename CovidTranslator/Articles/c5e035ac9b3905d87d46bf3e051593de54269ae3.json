It is often suggested that there remains a large number of viruses in humans that we have not yet discovered or recognised, and that there is a much larger and rapidly evolving pool of potential new viruses in mammalian and avian reservoirs that humans are continually being exposed to. However, a careful examination of discovery rates of new human RNA virus species, genera and families challenges this view, raising the possibility that the diversity is much more limited. Moreover, there is some evidence that the cast of human viruses is dynamic, with existing viruses disappearing (at least from humans) and new viruses appearing (perhaps evolving) over timescales of decades. Most of these new viruses, however, remain rare; only a small (but highly significant) minority are capable of spreading extensively through human populations.",

In the hundred years and more since then we have learnt an enormous amount about the nature of viruses, their biology, the ways that they interact with hosts and how they cause disease. But despite that enormous research effort (tens of thousands of published papers per year) we still do not know how many kinds of virus there are, even in the most-studied host species of all: us. This gap is especially surprising given the huge interest in biodiversity in general and the many methods that ecologists have developed to quantify or estimate it [2] . This paper is intended as a contribution to filling that gap, concentrating mainly on RNA viruses that infect humans.",

Only a minority are capable of persisting in human populations (as endemic infections) or spreading through human populations (as epidemic infections) in the absence of a reservoir.

Even so, the process of virus detection and identification is still mostly initiated by clinical observation; only quite recently have prospective studies of the diversity of human viruses been attempted and all of these have been relatively small-scale. However, it is widely held that the vast majority of human infections are not reported to medical practitioners and that no aetiological agent is formally identified for most of those that are. So it is unsurprising that we are still discovering new viruses that can infect humans (as is discussed in detail below). The key question, of course, is how many viruses remain to be discovered. We consider some approaches to answering this question below, but we begin by reviewing the taxonomic diversity of known viruses.",

The standard unit of taxonomy is the species. Rather than attempt a rigorous definition of a RNA virus \"species\" here, we simply follow the usage adopted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [10] . The main ICTV criteria for defining RNA virus species are: relatedness based on sequence data; serological cross-reactivity; host range; and transmission route. None of these is an unequivocal marker of reproductive isolation, the usual meaning of \"species\", and, worse still, they are used inconsistently across different virus taxa. This can lead to instances of 'splitting' (defining a high number of species relative to the amount of variation present) or 'lumping' (the opposite) -which can distort the kinds of pattern we will consider later on.",

This is an intriguing result as it implies that the majority of human RNA viruses may already have been discovered. This estimate is consistent with our previous studies [8, 13] that fitted simple statistical models of the virus discovery process (for both RNA and DNA viruses) using maximum likelihood methods in order to estimate the discovery rate and, crucially, the size of the species pool, i.e. the total number of species that can infect humans. Based on data available in 2005, this approach generated an unbounded upper limit pool of human virus species, but a lower limit which is consistent with most human virus species (>70%) already having been discovered.",

In Figure 2 we show two representations of the taxonomic data: the numbers of species per genus and the numbers of genera per family. Both of these show a characteristic pattern that most genera (or families) are not very diverse but a small number are highly diverse; this pattern is well modelled by a simple power function [2] . One criticism of this approach is that the higher taxa are human constructs rather than truly natural entities, so any patterns emerging tells us more about the behaviour of taxonomists than about the workings of nature. Nonetheless, for well-studied taxa such as birds and mammals the model is empirically robust [2] and virus taxonomy shows no obvious anomalies compared with the taxonomies of other organisms. Woolhouse where S is the estimated number of species, G is the observed number of genera, and F is the observed number of families. Yet higher taxa -orders, classes etc. -are not well defined for viruses so we do not use them here (cf. [2] ). The combination of current values for G and F (47 and 17 respectively) is highly consistent with the pattern reported by Mora et al. for all Animalia. Using these values gives a best estimate of S=187 species (with jack-knifeestimated 95% confidence intervals of \u00b113), implying that 79-91% of species are already known. However, both G and F are probably underestimated. To allow for this we make the plausible assumption that viruses which infect humans will eventually be found in all currently recognised genera and families containing RNA viruses which infect mammals [10] . This gives G=60 and F=19 and generates an estimate of S=297 species (\u00b129). Even this higher and probably more realistic estimate implies that 48-59% of species are already known.",

In some instances this may simply reflect diversification within human populations: this is likely to apply to groups such as the human astroviruses [10] , but it does not appear to be the dominant mode of speciation for many, perhaps most, human RNA viruses. More commonly, new RNA virus species arise as a result of jumps from one host species to another [5] . The most striking recent (in evolutionary terms) example of this among human viruses is the origin of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 from its immediate ancestor in chimpanzees, SIV cpz [20] . The origins of most of the other 51 'human-adapted' RNA virus species are much less well known, but many are suspected to have jumped from other host species. Moreover, the great majority of them fall into the category of \"crowd diseases\", which implies that they require relatively high host densities to persist [6] . In that case, an order-of-magnitude estimate of one such event per 100 years (rather than one per 1000 years or one per 10 years) is broadly consistent with human demographic history [6] . Of course, this does not preclude the Woolhouse The overall balance between exposure and evolution as drivers of human RNA diversity is difficult to assess with any precision, particularly for those that are not human-adapted and exist primarily in non-human reservoirs. So we do not know what fraction of the 2 or so new species of human RNA virus discovered per year are of recent evolutionary origin.

While we will surely see many more viruses added to the catalogue of diversity in coming years, it is difficult to imagine that our inventory of, say, viruses of all mammals and birds is likely to be any more than the tip of the iceberg for the foreseeable future. It may be that there is a case for concentrating our efforts on hosts most likely to be reservoirs of potentially epidemic human pathogens (as opposed to minor zoonotic infections). There is some suggestion that viruses acquired from other primates may be of special concern [8] but this is far from an absolute rule: SARS coronavirus, for example, is believed to have originated in bats [21] and influenza A is primarily a virus of wildfowl [22] .",

We may not be too far away from developing purely sequence-based taxonomies, although there is still the challenge of relating sequence differences to both reproductive isolation (i.e. \"species\" in the usual sense) and also to function (notably the abilities to infect, transmit from and cause disease in humans). The goal of being able to 'read' virus sequences and inferring their properties (such as an ability to infect humans or potential to cause disease) as a routine procedure still seems a very long way off. But recent studies of the substitutions required for avian H5N1 influenza A to become transmissible in ferrets hint that progress is possible [23] .",

A seminal study of this kind [24] that analysed gene sequences from 42 mosquitoborne flaviviruses estimated that there were many hundreds and more likely thousands of as yet undiscovered species in that group. This approach, which is essentially a way of estimating under-sampling near the tips of a phylogenetic tree based on specified assumptions about the underlying macroevolutionary processes, has parallels with that of Mora et al.'s [2] analysis of taxonomic hierarchies.

This could indeed be the case, but here we acknowledge the alternative possibility that the number of species of RNA virus capable of infecting humans could, in fact, be relatively limited. Even so, in this context \"limited\" corresponds to many tens or even hundreds of additional species which, without extraordinary advances in technology or increases in effort, will keep virus hunters occupied for many decades at least.

But this is not apparent in the existence of a huge diversity of known human-adapted viruses (i.e. those which are capable of persisting in human populations in the absence of a non-human reservoir). There are only 50 or so species of such viruses and even if, as is plausible, most of these have arisen in the past few millennia the appearance of a new one must still be a relatively rare event (though the possibility remains a clear and present threat to public health).",

In this context it is more believable (given a very large pool of mammal and bird viruses on which to draw) that new species are appearing very frequently, even if most of these have little prospect of becoming truly human-adapted. But it seems that this is not a simple process of accumulation: there is evidence suggesting that zoonotic viruses that appear in human populations can also disappear again. If this is correct, it would inevitably result in (i) limits to the amount of standing diversity present in humans at any one time, and (ii) substantial turnover (perhaps on a time scale of just a few decades) in the cast of species to be found in humans.",
