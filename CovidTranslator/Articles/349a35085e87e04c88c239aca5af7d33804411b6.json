Translation of 26S RNA starts on free ribosomes, but nascent autocatalytic cleavage of the capsid protein releases the signal peptide at the N terminus of E3, which guides the ribosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The capsid protein associates transiently with the 60S subunit of the translating ribosome, and is then transferred to the 42S RNA genome during the assembly of the nucleocapsid (10) . The assembly of the nucleocapsid is poorly understood, but RNA-protein interactions probably play an important role (11) (12) (13) . E3 plus E2 are translocated as a precursor protein p62, which is co-translationally glycosylated. E1 is preceded by a hydrophobic 6K protein, the N terminus of which serves as a signal peptide. The cellular K~,~RIAINEN AND AHOLA signal peptidase cleaves between p62 and 6K, and between 6K and El. The E1 and p62, which acquire N-linked complex glycans (14, 15) , are transported via the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane, p62 is cleaved into E3 and E2 by a furin-like protease during transport from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. In SIN-infected cells, E3 is secreted to the medium, whereas SFV E3 remains associated with the El-E2 heterodimer and is incorporated into virions during their budding at the plasma membrane.",

Thus, the superfamily concept is biologically useful, although superfamilies have no officially recognized taxonomic status. A comprehensive analysis of RNA virus sequences suggests that the superfamilies might be as few as three in number, i.e., the picornavirus-like, alphavirus-like, and flavivirus-like viruses (16) , although it could be argued that the coronavirus-like viruses and positive-strand RNA bacteriophages could also be placed in their own groups. A striking feature of the superfamilies is that although the replicase proteins share sequence similarity, and therefore a common descendent within the superfamily, the viruses may exhibit widely variable structures (nonenveloped and enveloped) and infect different kinds of hosts (plants and animals). Even within the superfamilies, the replicase proteins often show rearrangements and acquisition or deletion of domains.",

The genome organization of three superfamily members is illustrated in Fig. 2 to highlight some of the similarities and differences. The replicase proteins always feature three conserved domains (16) , an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase module, a conserved helicase-like domain of helicase superfamily SF1, and a module termed methyltransferase, or more recently capping enzyme. The presence of the methyltransferase/capping enzyme is the distinguishing hallmark of the alphavirus-like superfamily, as it is always present in superfamily members, and on the other hand, its relationship to other viral or cellular polypeptides is exceedingly distant (17, 18) . The are encoded by the same RNA), although they may be separated by other domains or be finally present in separate polypeptides as a result of proteolytic processing.",

In many other respects the viruses can be highly dissimilar. For instance, the genome can either consist of a single RNA or be segmented.

As the remaining sequence similarity of even the conserved portions of the replicase is so low, it would be surprising if they had not adapted in many ways to different functions during the evolution of different lineages within the superfamily. Nevertheless, the basic replication complex with the conserved capping enzyme, helicase and polymerase domains is likely to be similar throughout the alphavirus-like superfamily, as all viruses have to perform a closely similar set of coordinated reactions. These similarities, when experimentally discovered and proven, will validate the virus superfamily concept.

In addition, there is a heterogenous, partly double-stranded replicative intermediate (RI) RNA sedimenting between 20S and 29S. When this heterogenous material is isolated and subjected to RNase treatment, double-stranded RNAs arise. The replicative form RFI consists of a complete duplex of full-size plus and minus strands, whereas RFIII represents 26S RNA plus strand together with a respective portion of minus strand. RFII is a double-stranded form of the 5' two-thirds of the genome. After short pulses with tritiated uridine, label is found in RFI and RFIII, whereas labeling of RFII takes a much longer time. These results lead to the deduction that the genome RNA is synthesized via a replicative intermediate RIa, which after ribonuclease treatment yields RFI, whereas another structure Rib is involved in the synthesis of the subgenomic 26S RNA. RNase treatment of Rib yields both RFII and RFIII. The slow labeling of RFII was interpreted to mean a slow interconversion between RIa and Rib, i.e., between synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNAs (23, 24) ( Fig. 3) .",

            "text": "The genomes of alphaviruses have four conserved sequence motifs, two at the 5' end within the first about 200 nucleotides, one of about an 20-nt-long motif at the 3' end preceding the poly(A) sequence, and one of about 20 nt, which in minus-strand RNA serves as the promoter for the synthesis of 26S RNA (34) . In addition, the genome has a recognition signal for its incorporation into nucleocapsid particles, the so-called encapsidation signal. In SIN RNA it is located in the coding region of nsP1 (35) ; and in SFV, in the region coding for nsP2 (36) . The conserved 5' and 3' end sequences plus the encapsidation sequences have been regularly found in defective-interfering RNAs (DI-RNAs) of alphaviruses, although often in rearranged order (37) (38) (39) (40) . The extreme 5' end of some DI-RNAs differs from that of the genome RNA (41, 42) . This suggests that the conserved sequences downstream of the extreme 5' terminus act as the RNA replication signals (43, 44) (Fig. 3 ). ICd~RIJLINEN AND AHOLA Synthesis of SFV and SIN 42S RNA minus strands takes place within the first hours of infection. At 37-40\u00b0C, minus-strand RNA synthesis is maximal around 2.5-3 h and is shut off approximately 4 h after infection. At 28\u00b0C, the shut-off takes place about 6 h after infection. Minus-strand RNA synthesis is accompanied by synthesis of plus strands at a ratio of about I to 5. The synthesis of minus-strand RNA is strictly dependent on protein synthesis and ceases within 15 min after addition of, e.g., cycloheximide, unlike the synthesis of RNA plus strands (45) . Thus, continuous protein synthesis is required to produce the \"minus-strand RNA polymerase.\" The virus specificity of this early polymerase has been confirmed by analyzing temperature-sensitive virus mutants. An RNAnegative SIN mutant, tsll, is defective only in minus-strand RNA synthesis, when infected cultures are shifted from the permissive (28\u00b0C) to the restrictive (39\u00b0C) temperature. The defect of ts11 is due to one amino acid replacement Ala348Thr in nsP1 (46) , indicating that nsP1 is specifically involved in the regulation of minus-strand RNA synthesis (47, 48) . Another SIN mutant, ts4, with an amino acid change Ala268Val in the nsP3 protein, is also defective in minusstrand synthesis (49) .",

Expression of recombinant vaccinia virus constructions, encoding various uncleavable polyproteins, showed that minusstrand RNA synthesis requires uncleaved P123, together with correctly cleaved nsP4 (50-54) (Fig. 3A) . Processing of P123 into nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3 stops minus-strand RNA synthesis and enables their use as templates for synthesis of plus strands. Late in infection, new replication complexes cannot be assembled, as nsP2 protease rapidly cleaves P1234 through an alternative pathway first producing P12 and P34.",

            "text": "At a time when the function of 26S RNA was not known, evidence accumulated that its synthesis was not coupled with the synthesis of 42S RNA. Puromycin, given early in SIN infection, inhibits only 26S RNA production (45, 73) . RNA-negative ts mutants of SFV and SIN, which are unable to replicate at 39\u00b0C, have been isolated and characterized (74) (75) (76) (77) . With some of the mutants, the synthesis of only 26S RNA stops after shift to the restrictive temperature. One particular SFV mutant, ts4, turned out to be interesting in this respect. When ts4-infected cells were incubated at 28\u00b0C for 6 h to start the RNA synthesis, followed by a shift to 39\u00b0C in the presence of cycloheximide, the synthesis of 26S RNA was specifically shut off. However, it was resumed, once the cultures were shifted back to 28\u00b0C. The reversal was independent of protein synthesis (78) . Careful analysis of the labeled RIs and double-stranded RNAs from ts4-infected cells revealed a reversible shift of Rib to RIa. This leads us to suggest that a virus-specific protein regulates the initiation of 26S RNA synthesis by binding reversibly to a promoter on the minus-strand RNA within the replicative intermediate Rib (79) (Fig. 3D and 3E) . SFV ts4 has a single-amino acid replacement Met781Thr in nsP2. Reversible cross-linking experiments suggested that an increased amount of nsP2 was associated with the other nsPs at 28\u00b0C as compared to 39\u00b0C (59) . All SIN ts mutants with a defect in 26S RNA synthesis have been mapped to the C-terminal half on nsP2 (46, 59) .",

Proteins of similar size were also identified in SIN-infected cells (76, 86) . Sequencing of the SIN (33) and SFV (32) genome RNAs revealed differences in the translation strategies of the nonstructural proteins. In SFVinfected cells, the entire nonstructural region coding for 2432 aa is translated as polyprotein P1234. In the SIN genome, there is an opal termination codon close to the carboxy terminus of nsP3. This is occasionally suppressed, giving rise to P1234 (2513 aa). Thus, in SIN-infected cells, an excess of P123 is produced, and nsP4 can only be produced by processing of P1234 (34) . In vitro translation of SIN genome RNA has been used to study the processing of P123 and P1234, produced from an RNA where the opal codon was mutated to a codon for cysteine. Both P123 and P1234 are processed in vitro autocatalytically due to protease activity of nsP2 (87) (88) (89) (90) . This complex process was approached by using constructions in which the cleavage sites were mutated either alone or in combination with substrates in which the protease activity had been eliminated (34, 89) . The experiments resulted in cleavage \"rules\": (i) P1234 can cleave autocatalytically to produce P123 and nsP4; (ii) P123 cannot cleave in cis but can be cleaved only in a bimolecular reaction; (iii) P12 can slowly cleave autoproteolytically to nsP1 and nsP2; (iv) all three sites can be cleaved in trans (34, 91) . However, the most important result from this work was the possibility to express stable precursor proteins, which revealed the nature of the \"early RNA polymerase\" (P123 plus nsP4) (52, 53) .",

For BMV la, it has been directly demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy analysis of reaction products that methylation takes place only on the 7-position of guanylate (100) , which is in keeping with the fact that alphavirus-like viral mRNAs are capped with cap0 structure mTGpppN lacking further methyl groups. Although nsP 1 exclusively forms a covalent complex with mTGMP, it cannot accept mTGTP directly as a substrate for complex formation. Instead, GTP and AdoMet are required, indicating that methylation and covalent complex formation are normally coupled (18) . dGTP is a good substrate for methylation by both nsP1 and BMV la, but yet these enzymes preferentially form a covalent complex with mVGMP, as compared to mTdGMP, indicating that further selection takes place at the guanylyltransfer step (95, 100, 101) . BMV la with a covalently bound guanylate appears to be inhibited in further methyltransferase reactions (100) . SFV nsP1 has to be associated with anionic phospholipids in order to be active in the capping reactions (106; see below).

Only when the structures of several cellular methyltransferases became available, it was demonstrated that the predicted secondary structure of a portion of nsP1 and related viral proteins was similar to known methyltransferase structures (18) . It was also shown by cross-linking that two conserved residues Asp64 and Asp90 in two adjacent loops of SFV nsP1, which correspond to the AdoMet-binding region of structurally studied methyltransferases, are needed for AdoMet binding and methyltransferase activity (18, 100) . The same region is implicated in AdoMet binding by a double-mutation Arg87Leu and Ser88Cys in SIN nsP1, which enables virus growth in methionine-deprived cells and lowers the KM of the methyltransferase for AdoMet (107, 108) .

An nsP1 double-mutation Ser23Asn and Val302Met is required for resistance (110, 111) , which may indicate that these two regions of the protein ALPHAVIRUS NONSTRUCTURAL PROTEINS 201 flanking the conserved methyltransferase domain may come together in the three-dimensional structure to form the GTP-binding site.",

In cellular enzymes, a conserved lysine residue forms the covalent linkage with GMP. There are no conserved lysines in nsPl-like proteins, although the properties of the covalent linkage resemble that ofa phosphoamidetype bond (95) . Instead, an absolutely conserved histidine (His38 in SFV nsP1) is a good candidate for covalent binding of m7GMP, in that mutations of this residue permit retention of methyltransferase activity but completely abolish covalent nucleotide binding (18, 100) . Thus, joining of guanylyltransferase with the methyltransferase region and coupling of these two activities may represent an evolutionary innovation, which took place in a progenitor of the alphavirus superfamily. It should be noted that although the region showing high conservation within the alphavirus-like superfamily encompasses only 200 aa (17), at least alphavirus nsPls require approximately 500 aa for enzymatic activities (18, 104) .",

It can only be released to solution by detergents or highly alkaline solutions (pH 12) (112, 114) . The tight membrane interaction of nsP1 is mediated by covalent palmitoylation of one or more of the cysteine residues 418-420 in SFV nsP1, and a single-cysteine 420 in SIN nsP1 (113, 114) (Fig. 5) . Conserved cysteine(s) are found in this position in all alphavirus nsPls, suggesting that palmitoylation is a conserved feature. However, if the palmitoylation sites of nsP1 are removed by mutagenesis, the protein still retains a weak peripheral affinity for membranes (114) . Nonpalmitoylated nsP1 can also function in SFV or SIN replication in complexes that appear normal in their localization and morphology. The resultant viruses show only very slightly reduced growth rates in cell culture, but neuropathogenesis of at least SFV encoding nonpalmitoylated nsP1 is abolished in mice (113) . Nonpalmitoylated nsP1 binds to membranes through direct interaction of the polypeptide chain with anionic phospholipids (Fig. 7) . This interaction can be observed for nsP1 expressed in Escherichia coli or by in vitro translation and is mainly mediated by amino acids 245-264, where both positively charged and hydrophobic residues are required for binding (106) . As studied by NMR spectroscopy, the respective synthetic peptide forms an amphipathic alpha-helix, which can interact with liposomes containing acidic phospholipids. Trp259 is crucial for association and intercalates deep in the bilayer (115) . These results are consistent with monotopic binding of nsP1 to membranes, mediated by an amphipathic alpha-helical peptide using both ionic and hydrophobic interactions. Such a mechanism appears to be common for several diverse groups of proteins (116) . The nsP 1 polypeptide segment 245-264 is among the most highly conserved in the alphavirus-like superfamily (17) and could play a role in the membrane association of other superfamily members. All nsPl-related proteins 203 studied to date are associated with membranes (100, 102, 103) , although the binding mechanism has not been studied in other cases. The palmitoylation site is not conserved in other superfamily members and, indeed, they do not appear to be palmitoylated.",

Phospholipids appear to act by inducing a conformational change is nsP1, as cross-linking of the substrate AdoMet is also inhibited by detergents and reactivated by anionic lipids (106) . The behavior of palmitoylated nsP1 is slightly more complex. It is also inactivated by several detergents, but activated by deoxycholate and octylglucoside (94) , which may interact favorably with the palmitoylated form of the protein and permit maintenance of the active conformation. These results indicate that nsP1 is designed to function in a membraneous environment containing anionic phospholipids.

Ts11 suppresses nsP4 mutant ts24 (Gln191Lys), which in otherwise wild-type background allows reactivation of minus-strand synthesis by the stable replication complexes. This is interpreted to mean that nsP1 always directly participates in minus-strand synthesis during either initiation or elongation (48) . A mutation of the adjacent amino acid in SIN nsP1, Thr349Lys, is able to suppress the effect of a normally nonviable change in nsP4 2 0 4 I(,J~J(RLiiJNEN AND AHOLA of the N-terminal Tyr to Ala, Arg, or Leu. As an alteration of the nsP4 amino terminus appears to also cause a defect in minus-strand synthesis, it can be hypothesized that an interaction of these regions of nsP1 and nsP4 is required for minus-strand synthesis or promoter recognition (118) (Fig. 3A) .",

However, nsP1 lacks RNA triphosphatase activity essential for mRNA capping (97, 98) . Using short y-32P-labeled RNA molecules for screening, nsP2 has been identified as an RNA triphosphatase for both SFV and SIN. This activity, which removes specifically only the outmost y-phosphate, is also associated with the nsP2-N fragment, previously shown to have NTPase activity (122, 12 7) . Unlike the helicase activity, the RNA triphosphatase activity tolerates relatively high-salt concentrations. There is an absolute requirement for divalent cations, indicating that the alphavirus enzyme belongs to the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatases (98) . The GNS mutation in the NTP-binding site inactivated the triphosphatase activity, suggesting that NTPase and RNA triphosphatase reactions take place in the same reaction center. If so, NTPs should competitively inhibit the RNA triphosphatase reaction, as shown for, e.g., vaccinia virus-capping enzyme (128, 129) . However, this is not the case, as addition of GTP rather enhanced the triphosphatase activity, suggesting that hydrolysis of y-phosphate of NTPs and that of RNA take place in different reaction centers. This mode has been suggested for flavivirus NS3 protein, which is a 68-kDa multifunctional protein with NTPase/RNA triphosphatase/protease/RNA 206 ~RIAINEN AND AHOLA helicase activities (130) . It must be remembered that triphosphatase activity is needed only once during the synthesis of an RNA molecule, while RNA helicase/NTPase activities may be required throughout the synthesis.",

By this means, it was possible to study the proteolysis in vitro with purified reagents. The cleavage products were isolated, and their masses and N-terminal sequences were determined. These results show that (i) the cleavage takes place at the same sites as those determined in virus-infected cells (132, 133) ; (ii) the cleavage at site 3/4 is most efficient; (iii) about 5000-fold more enzyme is required for complete cleavage at site 1/2, whereas cleavage at site 2/3 remains poor even with huge excess of Pro39-enzyme (131) . These results are compatible with the previous observations that processing at site 3/4 takes readily place in trans. The poor cleavability of site 1/2 cannot be due to inaccessibility for the enzyme in this in vitro system. Rather, it suggests that some cofactor(s) is needed. This hypothetical \"factor\" is evidently present in polyproteins P12, P123, and P1234, in which the cleavage at site 1/2 takes place in cis. The very inefficient cleavage at site 2/3 is surprising, since P23 is cleaved rapidly after expression in insect cells and after in vitro translation (92; Merits et al., unpublished) . In the polyprotein precursors P1234 and P123 the cleavage of 2/3 site must be preceded by cleavage at the site 1/2 yielding P23 or P234 (89, 92) . Thus, cleavage at site 2/3 must also require a \"cofactor,\" which is probably different from that needed in the cleavage at site 1/2. The specificity of the cleavage at all three sites is determined solely by the protease moiety of nsP2, but the efficiency of the cleavage requires unidentified cofactors.",

Later in infection, there was a considerable delay in the processing of the polyproteins (P1234, P123, and P12). There was also a clear delay in the virus release from the SFV-RDR mutant-infected cells. However, the final yields were the same as those with the wild type. Normally, SFV inhibits cellular protein and RNA and DNA syntheses efficiently (137) . There is a clear difference in the inhibition of host cell DNA synthesis at 6 h after infection between wild type (13% of uninfected control cells) and SFV-RDR (about 50%). No significant difference in the inhibition of host protein synthesis was found between the wild type and the mutant.

However, wild-type SFV spreads rapidly, infecting cells throughout the brain, while SFV-DRD infection is confined to small loci of cells. When mice deficient in type I interferon responses were infected with SFV-RDR, the virus was distributed widely in the brain causing death (137a). These results stress the importance of the interferon system as a host defence mechanism. They also show that a component of RNA polymerase complex can be vital for the neuropathogenicity of SFV. The slower processing of P1234 strongly suggests that the RDR mutation affects the protease moiety of nsP2, causing a delay in early replication events. This delay may be vital for the host defense system to be able to limit the infection to the primary foci of infected cells. Thus, the nuclear localization of nsP2 may reflect the structural requirements of the multifunctional nsP2 protein rather than a separate nuclear function.",

Furthermore, deletion of 50 amino acid residues from the variable region of SFV nsP3 results in viable but apathogenic virus mutant (see Section VIII,B). There is a clear reduction in the RNA synthesis rate between 2.5 and 6 h after infection, which results in a delay of virus release from the cells, although final virus yields are same as those with the wild type (138) . One simple possibility is that, with all these mutants, the delay in virus replication is enough for the host to successfully limit the infection of brain cells, which usually causes the death of the animals in wild-type SFV infection.

Related sequences are found not only in the genomes of rubella virus and hepatitis E virus but also in otherwise unrelated coronaviruses (but not in alphavirus-like plant viruses or coronaviruslike arteriviruses) (120) . Recently, it has become apparent that this domain is widely, although not universally, distributed in bacteria, archae, and eukaryotes (139) . It usually exists on its own as a small protein, but the human genome also contains open reading frames in which this domain is repeated. A gene termed BAL, which contains a duplicated nsP3-like domain, is a highly expressed risk factor in certain aggressive lymphomas (140) . The conservation between viral and cellular homologs is unusually high for an RNA virus protein, reaching up to 35-40% sequence identity (139) . Furthermore, an unusual class of histone variants found in animal ceils predominantly associated with the inactivated X chromosome, the macrohistones H2A, contains a more distantly related nsP3like domain following the core histone domain (139) . The biochemical function of the nsP3 domain remains unknown, but the high conservation points to a basic and essential role in catalysis or binding. A possible clue is provided by the yeast gene YBR022w, the product of which was shown to hydrolyze ADP-ribosel\"phosphate (141) . However, the yeast homolog is much less related to human and bacterial proteins than the latter are to each other or to nsP3, pointing to a possible divergence of function. Furthermore, a more general role for such an unusual nucleotide compound may be difficult to envision. Nevertheless, nsP3-1ike proteins could potentially be phosphoesterases hydrolyzing an as yet unidentified substrate.",

This has been proven in the case ofSFV nsP3, where the phosphorylation sites have been mapped by mass spectrometric methods (I45), supported by mutation analysis (138) . The phosphorylation pattern is complex, as a total of 16 possible sites (Ser320, 327, 332, 335, 347, 348, 349, 352, 356, 359, 362, 367, and Thr344, 345, 350, 354) can become phosphorylated. Differentially phosphorylated forms of the protein exist, since forms containing from 7 up to the 12 possible phosphates in the region Thr344-Ser367 have been detected. Based on point mutational analysis, Thr344/Thr345 appear to be the major threonine phosphorylation sites. Thus, phosphorylation is confined to a small subregion of the tail (Fig. 9A) , the deletion of which abolishes phosphorylation both in the cells expressing nsP3 alone and in the context of virus infection (138, 145) .

Experiments with ts mutants strongly support the contention that nsP4 is the catalytic polymerase subunit. SIN mutations Gly153Glu (ts6) and Gly324Glu (tsll0) map to nsP4 (149) . Ts6 causes a rapid cessation of all RNA synthesis when cells are shifted to ALPHAVIRUS NONSTRUCTURAL PROTEINS 211 nonpermissive temperature (47, 76) , and tsll0 has a similar but milder phenotype (149) . The ts6 defect is reproduced in polymerase extracts prepared from infected cells, which enabled an elegant demonstration that the defect affects elongation of RNA chains first initiated at the permissive temperature (71) . SIN mutations causing resistance to pyrazofurin, a compound lowering cellular UTP and CTP levels, also map to nsP4 and may increase the affinity of the polymerase for pyrimidine nucleotides (150) . Finally, a mutation Gln191 Lys in SIN nsP4 causes a reactivation of minus-strand synthesis at the restrictive temperature, a phenotype similar to many nsP2 mutants, indicating that nsP4 is also involved in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis shut-off (57) (see Section IV, B).",

Experiments described in Section IV, A indicate that P1234, cleaved at site 3/4, yields the minus-strand RNA polymerase, P123 plus nsP4, although it is not Kfi~RL~INEN AND AHOLA known whether one heterodimer constitutes an active complex. Our recent results with expression of uncleavable polyproteins P1234 and P123 in insect and mammalian cells have shown that they both bind to intracellular membranes and become palmitoylated (Salonen et al., unpublished) . Thus, we can expect that the minus-strand RNA polymerase is membrane bound, probably by a mechanism similar to that demonstrated for nsP1 (see Section VI,B). We assume that several rounds of translation take place, resulting in a small pool of membrane-bound polyprotein.",

The 42S RNA minus strand acts as a template, but whether it is part of either double-or single-stranded RNA is not definitively known. It can be deduced that the synthesis of the plus strand starts from the penultimate base. The presence of replicative intermediate RNA with nascent plus strands has suggested a model, according to which a single minus strand is copied by several polymerase molecules (23, 24) (Fig. 3C) . According to this model, the double-stranded replicative forms RFI, II, and III arise during RNA isolation by hybridization of the excess plus strands to the minus-strand template. The same replication complex can alternate between synthesis of 42S and 26S RNA, regulated by an extra \"soluble\" nsP2 transcription factor (59, 79) ( Fig. 3D and 3E ). An important feature of the late replication complex is its stability, as it continues to make both 42S RNA and 26S RNA for several hours using the same minus strand as template.",

CPVs are modified endosomes and lysosomes (64) (65) (66) 112) . We have suggested that each spherule represents one unit of replication, carrying a 42S RNA minus-strand template as well as a set of late RNA polymerases, each consisting of nsPl-nsP4 (66) . This hypothesis is supported The membrane association of the replication complex has interesting consequences. Since the polymerase is fixed to the membrane, the template RNA must move. If a single spherule constitutes a unit of replication, the template RNA of about 11.5 kb must be packed within the spherule of a diameter of about 50 nm. If the template were double-stranded RNA, the packing would be even tighter. In order to achieve continuous synthesis of plus strands, the template should preferably be circular. The classical model of RI, with one template occupied by several polymerases (Fig. 3C) , is difficult to reconcile with polymerases that are fixed to the membrane. The problem could be solved, assuming that the same template is successively passing from one membrane-associated polymerase to another in a circular manner (Fig. 10) ",

Even though progress has been made, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of RNA replication is far from complete. The threedimensional structures of the nsPs are required to further define their roles in RNA replication. An even more demanding task is to isolate, or reconstitute, the unit of replication in functional form.",

The minus-strand template (dotted line) is shown in association with a complementary plus strand (solid line). The late RNA polymerase molecules (pol), consisting of nsPl-nsP4, localized to the orfice of the spherule, are fixed to the membrane. The dsRNA template rotates through two different polymerases (in this image) in the direction shown by the long arrow. Nascent, capped, positive RNA strands, arise by semiconservative replication. Upon reaching the cytoplasm they are utilized for translation early in infection and later for the assembly of nucleocapsids(64).",
