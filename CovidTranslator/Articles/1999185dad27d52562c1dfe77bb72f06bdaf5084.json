            "text": "N-and C-terminal regions of the NP serve as B-cell epitopes in host [4, 5] . In particular, C-terminal immunological region that forms alpha helical structure is permissible for modification. Thus this epitopic region can serve as negative marker if replaced with a foreign epitope [6] . For example, amino acid sequence ETQFLDLMRAVANSMR (aa 444-459) on NDV NP is an epitope, which serves as linear immunodominant epitope (IDE) and can be replaced or deleted [4] . This antigen should facilitate differentiation of vaccinated animal to that of infected during serosurveillance in the case of the marker vaccine applying vaccination program. A multiepitope protein as a vaccine candidate [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] or as diagnostic reagent [13] [14] [15] has been explored in multiple instances. Multiepitope recombinant proteins are advantageous as they can be designed rationally and offers higher specificity and sensitivity [16] .",

For a 99% confidence interval, the cutoff value determined was 0.232 (mean OD of SPF sera samples+3 SD). Based on the cutoff value, the reactivity of rERP with chicken anti-AIV, anti-IBV, anti-IBDV, and normal sera was measured. The result showed that OD450 nm values of non-NDV sera were lower than cutoff value (Fig. 3A) . The minimum dilution titer of chicken anti-NDV serum detected was 1:1,600 according to cutoff value of 0.232 (Fig. 3B ).",

A serologic marker antigen is a viral protein or an epitope that is absent from the vaccine strains but consistently present in the corresponding wildtype viruses [5] . Therefore, only animals that have been infected with wild-type virus will develop antibodies against the serologic marker antigen while the vaccinated animals will not. The marker antigen should be conserved and immunodominant to ensure that the companion diagnostic test based on this marker antigen will produce reliable diagnostic results [20] . In addition, the marker antigen should be dispensable for the viral life cycle but should not contribute significantly to the overall immunogenicity of the vaccine. Subunit vaccines using F and HN protein [21] can serve as marker vaccines but are less effective than whole virus vaccines [22] . This necessitates NDV marker vaccine based on chimeric live virus.",

This indicates that the expressed rERP has the molecular weight as expected. We employed the indirect ELISA to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the expressed rERP using confirmed positive and negative sera samples. rERP could react specifically with the anti-NDV serum and showed no reactivity towards anti-IBV, anti-IBDV, anti-AIV, and normal sera. It suggests that rERP can specifically recognize anti-NDV antibodies. The potential of rERP ELISA to serve as discriminatory test in combination with the IDE deleted marker vaccine was investigated using three panels of sera. The test correctly classified the marker vaccinated and SPF chicken sera as antibody negative but sera from wildtype NDV immunized chickens as antibody positive. These results revealed that rERP possessed good reactivity, specificity and sensitivity.",
