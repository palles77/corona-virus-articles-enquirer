The structures of the new compounds were established by IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR (proton decoupled, APT, and DEPT), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and microanalysis. Compounds bearing a phenyl substituent at position 8 of the spiro ring, exhibited significant antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv ATCC 27294 at concentrations of 3.9 and 7.8 \u00b5M. Still, some of the tested compounds displayed activity on mycobacteria with MIC values of 16 and 31 \u00b5M. Four of the indole-spirothiazolidinone derivatives were found to be moderately active against Punta Toro virus, yellow fever virus or Sindbis virus in Vero cells. The antiviral EC 50 values were in the range of 1.9-12 \u00b5M and the selectivity index (ratio of cytotoxic to antivirally effective concentration) was above 10 in some cases. The most potent effect was seen with the compound that is methylated at positions 2 and 8 of the spirothiazolidinone system.",

Major problems associated with the currently available TB treatment include long treatment duration, inadequate compliance, concurrent HIV infection, and increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis [2] [3] [4] [5] . This emergence of difficult to treat strains necessitates the discovery and development of novel antitubercular drugs. After this domain has been inactive for several decades, two new drugs became available, i.e., the mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor bedaquiline and mycolic acid biosynthesis inhibitor delamanid, which received accelerated approval for the treatment of MDR tuberculosis in 2012 and 2014, respectively [6] . Besides, diverse novel drug candidates are in preclinical or clinical development [6] [7] [8] .",

This type of compounds was found to be highly active against both drug-susceptible and drugresistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by acting on the MmpL3 transporter protein. In previous investigations, we have identified the indole-spirothiazolidinone system (Fig. 1b) as a promising scaffold against the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain [15, 16] . Some of these analogues exhibited in vitro antitubercular activity with GI (growth inhibition) values of 91-95% at a MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) value of 6.25 \u00b5g/cm 3 . Recently, we reported on the synthesis of novel 5-fluoro-3-phenyl-1H-indole derivatives containing a 4-thiazolidinone nucleus (instead of spirothiazolidinone system) [17] . Two molecules (Fig. 1c ) displayed notable antitubercular activity at concentrations tenfold lower than those that produced cytotoxicity in mammalian cell lines.",

The IR spectra of 4a-4i and 5a-5h exhibited the ring and the exocyclic C=O bands in the 1692-1713 cm \u22121 and 1651-1670 cm \u22121 , respectively. The shifts observed in the amide bands when compared to that of 3 (1636 cm \u22121 ) and the presence of additional lactam bands provided definite proof for the aimed cyclization. Observation of NH signals assigned to the indole NH (\u03b4 = 12.11-12.18 ppm) and amide NH (9.97-0.21 ppm) together with the absence of the NH 2 resonance of the intermediate hydrazide 3 in the 1 H NMR spectra of 4 and 5, provided further evidence for the formation of new adducts. The S-CH 2 (4a-4i) and S-CH (5a-5h) protons of the newly formed spiroalkane residue resonated at about 3.50-3.65 and 3.87-3.93 ppm, respectively. The S-CH 2 protons of 4a-4i appeared as singlets except for the methylene hydrogens of compound 4g which were observed as separate doublets with large coupling constants (J = 16.1 Hz) due to the geminal coupling resulting from the chiral centers of the spirothiazolidinone ring. The 1 H NMR spectra of 5a-5h displayed the thiazolidinone S-CH protons as quartets or broad/distorted singlets and doublets. Assignment of the indole protons was achieved on the basis of the values and coupling constants reported for the 2,3,5-trisubstituted indole ring [15, 16, 24, 25] . The carbon resonances were assigned by chemical shifts and comparison with previously reported 13 C NMR data for compounds having a similar backbone structure [15, 19, 26] .

Rows A-F contained 100 mm 3 of the compound dilutions, whereas rows G (positive control) and H (negative control) contained 100 mm 3 medium. One hundred mm 3 of the corresponding inoculum was added to all wells except for row H. The microplates were incubated at 35 \u00b0C for about 7-10 days, when mycobacterial growth was clearly visible as a white sediment in the positive control. Microbial growth was confirmed by Ehrlich-Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast stain. Resazurin solution (30 mm 3 ) was added to each well and the plates were incubated for one additional day. At that time, the first purple colored well in which no growth was visible, was defined as the compounds' MIC value (Table 1) .",

The antiviral reference compounds were: ganciclovir, brivudin, zanamivir, amantadine, ribavirin, dextran sulfate-10,000, and mycophenolic acid. Antiviral evaluation was carried out with a broad panel of viruses using cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assays. Human influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B viruses were examined on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Respiratory syncytial virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and Coxsackie B4 virus were evaluated on human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells. African Green Monkey Vero cells were used for parainfluenza-3 virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie B4 virus, Punta Toro virus and yellow fever virus. Human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblast cells were infected with herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, vaccinia virus, human adenovirus-2, and human coronavirus 229E.",

Together with the virus, fourfold dilutions of the test or reference compounds were added. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C (or 35 \u00b0C for influenza-and coronavirus) until far advanced CPE was visible, i.e., during 3-6 days or 10 days in the case of adenovirus-2. Then, microscopy was performed to score the CPE and calculate the 50% antivirally effective concentration (EC 50 ). Microscopy was also done to assess cytotoxicity, expressed as the compound concentration causing minimal changes in cell morphology (minimal cytotoxic concentration; MCC). [32, 33] . Serial twofold dilutions ranging from 2500 \u00b5M to 1.22 \u00b5M were prepared in the test medium, i.e., Mueller-Hinton broth for bacteria and RPMI-1640 medium for yeast strains. The inoculum was prepared using a 4-6 h broth culture of each bacteria type and 24 h culture of yeast strains adjusted to a turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard, diluted in broth media to give a final concentration in the test tray of 5 \u00d7 10 5 cfu/cm 3 for bacteria and 5 \u00d7 10 3 cfu/cm 3 for yeast. The trays were covered and placed into plastic bags to prevent evaporation. The bacteria trays were incubated at 35 \u00b0C for 18-20 h while the yeastcontaining trays were incubated at 35 \u00b0C for 46-50 h. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of compound giving complete inhibition of visible growth. Amikacin and fluconazole were used as reference antibiotics for bacteria and yeast, respectively; their MIC values were within the accuracy range of the CLSI guidelines [34] .",
