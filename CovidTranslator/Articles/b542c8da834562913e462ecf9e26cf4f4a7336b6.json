            "text": "Background: The risk of acquiring and spreading infection must be minimized in nursing students because they are exposed to healthcare-associated infections during clinical training. To achieve this goal, students should be knowledgeable and competent in infection control practice before proceeding to their training hospitals. Objectives: This study assessed the nursing students' perception of the infection prevention climate in training hospitals in Saudi Arabia. It also examined the predictors of the students' perceptions. Design: A quantitative, cross-sectional design was used. Methods: This investigation was part of a large study conducted in six Saudi universities. A total of 829 Saudi nursing students were included in this study. Data were collected using the Leading Culture of Quality in Infection Prevention scale and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Ethical approval was obtained from the King Saud University, and permission was given by the administration of each participating university. Results: The overall perception of nursing students indicated a modest infection prevention climate. Prioritization of quality and improvement orientation was rated as the highest dimensions, whereas psychological safety and supportive environment were the lowest. The nursing students in University F had the poorest perceptions among the six universities. The predictors of nursing student perception of their training hospitals' infection prevention climates were the university where they studied, their age, and participation in infection prevention seminars. Conclusions: This article describes nursing students' perception of the infection prevention climate of their training hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Results may provide a unique theoretical underpinning on the perception and factors that effect an infection prevention climate. Thereby, previous knowledge and literature may be expanded. Results can be used as a guide in establishing clinical policies in efforts toward improving the infection prevention climate.",

Despite the rich content pertaining to predictors of standard precautions compliance, systematic evidence linking nursing students' infection prevention climate perception in their respective training hospitals is lacking. With the rapid growth of resurgent infections, especially in Saudi Arabia , specific standards significant to infection control should be met by nursing students. To achieve this, universities and training hospitals should ascertain that their infection prevention and control education is appropriately focused.",

HAIs are among the most common diseases in hospitals with high morbidity and mortality rates (Ali et al., 2018) . Khan et al. (2017) have argued that HAIs are associated with unforeseen infection advances throughout the duration of healthcare treatment; furthermore, HAIs cause notable patient disease, deaths, and prolonged hospitalization, which creates additional financial burden on patients. According to the WHO (2011), 7 out of 100 hospitalized patients developed HAIs worldwide. In the US, approximately 1.7 million infections are detected annually in hospitals, with 99,000 associated mortality (KCDCP, 2011) . In Europe, approximately 7.1% patients develop HAIs, and 37,000 people die as a result (KCDCP, 2011) . In one quantitative study in Saudi Arabia, 851 HAIs were reported among 5523 hospitalized patients; hospital stays amounted to 53,025 days, averaging 9 days of hospitalization (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2013) . In November 2018, the country dealt with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak, which is a highly communicable and causes severe disease and result in high mortality (WHO, 2018) . These infectious occurrences continue to escalate at an alarming rate and pose a risk among health care professionals and patients. Thus, prevention of infectious diseases should become a major health care professionals and patient-safety initiative.",

These variations could be attributed to different infection prevention climate of healthcare settings. Cruz (2018) suggested that infection prevention climate is commonly understood by health care professionals pertaining to infection prevention in clinical practice. This finding is worth noting because in a descriptive study by Castro-S\u00e1nchez and Holmes (2015) , the infection prevention climate differences were due to standard precautions protocol, technical procedures, human resources, infection surveillance, and standard precautions compliance assessment. The variation could result in different geographical areas, healthcare facilities, and individual providers (Colet et al., 2018) . With the increasing prevalence of HAIs across the globe (WHO, 2011), infection prevention climate variation most likely affects patient-care quality. Nevertheless, describing this variation could support the implementation of interventions in decreasing HAIs, where this is most needed.",

The tool was designed to measure a hospital's culture for quality associated with infection prevention. It has 19 items and is responded using a 5-point Likert Scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). The LCQ-IP has four dimensions, which are central to infection prevention framework. These four dimensions are \"psychological safety (7 items), quality prioritization (5 items), supportive work environment (4 items), and improvement orientation (3 items)\". Scores are obtained by computing the dimension means and overall scale mean. Item 16 is negatively worded; hence, its score is reversed before further analysis. The four factors have Cronbach's alpha from 0.724 to 0.883, whereas the entire scale has a Cronbach alpha of 0.926 (Pogorzelska-Maziarz et al., 2016) . The Arabic version of the tool was used in the present study (Cruz, 2018) . Cruz (2018) reported the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the tool among Saudi nursing students. The exploratory factor analysis of the Arabic version of the tool supported the four dimensions of the scale, which supported its construct validity. The Arabic version also exhibited good internal consistency reliability, with Cronbach's alpha of 0.89.",

However, this result was lower than that conducted among nurses in Saudi Arabia (M = 3.86, SD = 0.51) (Colet et al., 2018) . This finding may be because training hospitals are a complex learning environment for nursing students, and each hospital may have different infection prevention and control policies. Thus, students might be unaware of the infection prevention and control protocol. Baraz et al. (2015) indicated that training hospitals are unpredictable, stressful, and constantly changing. Thus, such conditions may add confusion, and nursing students may be unable to handle the concepts of infection prevention and control at the required and defined time. Students most likely viewed that infection control is beyond their responsibilities. They might have thought that infection control is a responsibility of the staff nurses. However, this assumption requires further investigation.",

The present study suggests that each university and its affiliated training hospital may have different infection prevention and control curricular content. Different curricula mean different teaching approaches and different clinical experience, which may effect students' perceptions (Bowser et al., 2017) . Furthermore, the BSN programs of the 6 universities have varying amount of time for clinical experience of the students. This might have also effected the different perceptions among the students from different universities. Baraz et al. (2015) found that clinical learning in a training hospital takes place in a complex social context of the clinical environment. Given the complexities, it may be implied that the hospital wherein each nursing student was trained may have different infection prevention and control protocol and policies. Hence, the respondents may have different degrees of awareness and practices of infection prevention and control. Cruz (2018) stated that the quality of clinical training given on nursing students is the most important factor that influences their infection and prevention and control learning. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because the factors that influence students' infection prevention and control learning were not discussed. Establishing the competence and confidence of students is an essential factor of infection prevention and control success, and clinical educators should facilitate the process.",

This finding supports the work of other researchers that reported that the more nurses attended a workshop, the higher their motivation to practice infection control (Cruz, 2018; Cruz and Bashtawi, 2016) . A study conducted in one tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia found that consistent training and workshop contributed to HAI reduction (Al Kuwaiti, 2017) . A systematic review of HAI prevention among 92 studies from 1996 to 2012 found that some of the components in successful infection prevention and control implementation are education, training, and positive organizational culture (Zingg et al., 2015) . All studies in the review showed improvement in central-line-associated bloodstream infections after the education/training sessions.

Hence, organizing training and supervision and using supportive working condition strategies is necessary to make nursing students feel safe, creative, and engaged toward infection prevention and control implementation. Creating and defining nursing student's engagement rules should be done so that they can be comfortable, engage deeply, and communicate clearly to other health care professionals. In this regard, nursing students may feel included, important, and part of the healthcare team. A supportive working environment and high engagement can increase the students' motivation to tackle issues pertaining to infection prevention climate, development opportunities, and good performance. Facilitating meaningful connections between nursing students from various universities and their perceived infection prevention climate may improve through a comprehensive and unified course syllabus and supporting program that can empower students' learning.
