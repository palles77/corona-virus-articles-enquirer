All 200 healthcare workers, comprising doctors, nurses, health attendants, and receptionists in these surgical wards who were quarantined after the initial outbreak, were invited to participate. A total of 87 people volunteered. Of these, three had a history of probable SARS but had recovered sufficiently to return to work. Another group of 12 house officers, who joined the department during the week the study started, were invited to participate as negative controls because they had no prior exposure to known SARS patients. Informed consent was obtained from those who wished to take part. Participants filled out a questionnaire about symptoms experienced during the preceding weeks and donated a sample of blood by venipuncture; the serum specimen was stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to SARS-CoV were detected by using a dot blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a culture-derived, heat-inactivated virus antigen (E-E Ooi, unpub. data) at a serum dilution of 1:100. When compared to results of an indirect immunofluorescent assay in a limited study comprising 32 case-patients with clinically diagnosed SARS and 977 control serum samples collected before the SARS outbreak, sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 99.8%, respectively. Samples that tested positive for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV were further assayed for neutralizing antibodies by using the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) method, similar to that previously described (6) , under biosafety level 3 conditions, in serial twofold dilution, ranging from 1:10 to 1:320. The virus isolate used in this study, SARS-CoV 2003VA2774, has been previously sequenced (7) and was isolated from a patient in whom SARS was diagnosed. All assays were carried out in duplicate, and positive serum controls, obtained from a volunteer convalescent-phase SARS patient, were included in every run.",
