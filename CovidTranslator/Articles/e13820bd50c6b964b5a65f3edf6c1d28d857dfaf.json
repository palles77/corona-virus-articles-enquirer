Lots of variations have been detected among different SARS-CoV strains. And a study on these variations is helpful for development of efficient vaccine. Moreover, the test of nucleic acid characterization and genetic stability of SARS-CoV is important in the research of inactivated vaccine. The whole genome sequences of two SARS coronavirus strains after passage in Vero cell culture were determined and were compared with those of early passages, respectively. Results showed that both SARS coronavirus strains have high genetic stability, although nearly 10 generations were passed. Four nucleotide variations were observed between the second passage and the 11th passage of Sino1 strain for identification of SARS inactivated vaccine. Moreover, only one nucleotide was different between the third passage and the 10th passage of Sin03 strain for SARS inactivated vaccine. Therefore, this study suggested it was possible to develop inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV in the future.",

The SARS causative pathogen is a member of the family coronaviridae, which has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. The sequenced full-length genome of SARS-CoV is about 30 kilo-bases in length and has more than 10 open reading frames. And the genome organization is similar to that of other coronavirus. However, phylogenetic analyses and sequence 1824 comparisons showed that SARS-CoV is not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronavi-ruS[I-3J\u2022 Although having a number of unique features, SARS-CoV is most closely related to group 2 coronavirus, and was an early split-off from group 2 branch[4J. Our previous study also indicated that SARS-CoV did not resemble to any other known coronavirus, including lEV Beijing isolate which was once epidemic in China[5 J . However, the early infection of SARS-CoV may have originated from wild animals. SCoV-like viruses were isolated from Himalayan palm civets and genomes were identical to those of human isolates, but a 29-nt sequence found in the animal isolates was not detected in most human isolates. Other studies also showed that five strains from human contained this 29-nt segment, and 82-nt deletion or 415-nt deletion in the orj8 region were observed in some human isolates and an animal isolate[6, 7J.",

In addition, 299 single nucleotide variations were detected among 63 sequences. The neutral mutation rate of SARS-CoV is similar to that of known RNA virus and is about one-third of that for the human immunodeficiency virus[7 J . Molecular epidemiological approach and sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV viruses isolated from 10 Taiwanese patients suggested a recent introduction of the viruses into human populations. And the estimated genome mutation rate was about 0.1 per genome, demonstrating possibly one of the lowest rates among known RNA viruses[IOJ. A full-length cDNA of the SARS-CoV Urbani strain was assembled and molecularly cloned SARS viruses were rescued by using five contiguous cDNAs fragments that span the entire genome. Recombinant viruses replicated as efficiently as wild type virus. And the full-length cDNA of the SARS-CoV allowed for the development and testing of candidate vaccines, especially for the development of live attenuated vaccine [ll] .

Except these deletions, no other deletion or insert was detected between early passage and late passage of two virus strains. We think that the 5'-end of Sinol-2 and Sin03-3 isolate genomes could not be captured completely. In addition, four single nucleotide variations were detected between the second passage and the 11th passage of the Sino 1 strain. For Sin03 strain, the genome of passage3 differs that of passage10 only by one nucleotide. The reversion at nucleotide position 6574 from G to A in Sinol-ll isolate might be the result of a back-mutational event occurring potentially during the passage of the virus. Other studies also showed that there existed few genetic variations between primary samples and viruses isolated after limited passages of cultures from two SARS patients. The two sequences from patient 1 were completely identical, but few single nucleotide variations were detected between the two sequences from On the other hand, more or less variations were observed in the transmission of SARS.

However, studies of five SARS isolates from an index patient, three primary contacts of the index patient and one secondary contact related to the index patient, suggested that more mutations occurred during the transmission to escape from host immune response. Two sequences from primary contacts were found to have 5-nt deletion and 6-nt deletion in a non-coding region, respectively. Besides the deletion, there were nucleotides substitutions among the five sequences [8] . Virus passage in cell culture has fewer mutations than the transmission. Because of a stable condition in cell culture and non-selective pressure from host, the mutations of each point in the viral genome are low and similar, which result in the most variations for orflab, for s, then for n and so on. In our study, four of five single nucleotide variations were found in the region encoding Pplab which contains 2/3 the length of the whole genome.

As far as S glycoprotein is concerned, the amino acid sequence of S1 subunit is more variable than that of S2 subunit and more variations were detected in S1. Alignments of 14 different sequences of S indicated that most of the amino acid mutations in S glycoprotein are located in the Sl subunit (1-680) [13] . In this study, we also found that both amino acid variations in S glycoprotein lay in S1 domain. In addition, the 3-nt deletion in the Sinol strain genome caused an amino acid deletion in E protein. And the 2-nt deletion in the Sin03 strain genome was in the region encoding 8b protein and caused a stop of translation. Deletions occurred in the orj8 region with no apparent effect on the survival of the virus, suggesting that this region is either noncoding or coding for a functionally unimportant putative protein [7] . On the other hand, five base substitutions during the passage of virus in cell culture also changed the amino acid sequence, also showing that the rates of nonsynonymous changes were greater than those of synonymous changes for the s gene sequences and orfla sequences[7, IO J \u2022 Although amino acid sequences of two SARS-CoV isolates were changed after passage, no signs showed remarkable change in its immunogenicity and antigenicity. And the viral titer was at the same level before passage. In all, SARS-CoV passage in cell culture has high stability.",

It was very important to know the genetic stability of them. The complete genomes of these two SARS-CoV isolates, which repassaged in Vera cell culture, were sequenced and analyzed.
