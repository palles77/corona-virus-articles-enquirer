This is a timely Comment, considering the 2009 influenza pandemic, regional experiences with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and plague, and ongoing Ebola outbreaks. We strongly endorse the observations made regarding the nature and magnitude of the problems identified and the proposed solution of using existing networks with established research infrastructure and proven capabilities. We extend this discussion by identifying two additional challenges: the absence of existing networks in many low-resource settings and the unmet imperative to standardise data collection.",

One of the major challenges in reporting from the 2009 pandemic was the inability to merge data because of the absence of a standardised set of variables and a validated severity-of-illness score. 2, 3 In view of the diverse regional or global policies for hospital admission, health system capacity, and diagnostic testing, international comparisons of pandemic severity require these baseline standards to be meaningful.",

Currently, using approved observational protocols for severe acute respiratory infection, we collect periodic data annually to determine baseline severity and to identify problems with the existing research infrastructure. Future steps will include expanding research tool development to other syndromes likely to cause future outbreaks, such as encephalitis, incorporating health system capacity for accurate population-level burden assessments, and ensuring that these varied research networks continue to intersect in meaningful ways.",
