Methods: We screened 993 respiratory samples for HBoV by PCR among hospitalized children with SARI between September 2007 and March 2014. Four of HBoV1 samples were selected for complete genomes analysis by next-generation sequencing. Results: The results show that 200 (20.1%) out of 993 samples were HBoV-positive, most of these HBoV belong to HBoV1 subtype (n Z 197), HBoV2 (n Z 1) and HBoV3 (n Z 2) were also detected. Fifty (5.04%) of 993 SARI patient were detected as HBoV-positive only. Four HBoV1 genomes in this study were conserved and showed no significant difference among the nucleotide diversity from different regions. Analyses of evolutionary rates showed that NS1 exhibited the highest degree of conservation while the VP1 gene exhibited the fastest rate of evolution at 4.20 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 substitutions/site/year. The nucleotide deletions and substitutions occurred in NP1 and VP1 represented novel molecular signatures enabling subtype differentiation between HBoVs. Journal of Infection (2016) 73, 155e163 Conclusions: We described some new characteristics in the epidemiology of HBoV among children with SARI, these data will significantly expand the current knowledge of HBoV epidemic and genomic characterization among children with SARI.",

To better understand the molecular epidemiology and characterization of HBoV genome in children with SARI, we investigated the prevalence of HBoV among 993 inpatient children with SARI in China. Analyses of genome characterization were also performed.",

The case of SARI was defined according to the World Health Organization case definition for all hospitalized children in whom the onset of illness occurred within seven days of admission. Most of the patients had received clinical diagnosis of respiratory tract infection, including pneumonia, acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis, asthma exacerbation and acute pharyngitis. The most common respiratory symptoms included fever (temperature !38 C), cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, vomit, dyspnea and so on. 15 In addition, none of the samples come from the patients in Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and most of the children have no co-morbidities, such as heart and liver diseases. All the samples were collected by medical professionals and placed in a tube containing of viral transportation medium and stored at \u00c080 C.

All four genomes of HBoV1 sequenced in this study were shown to be closely related to each other at the nucleotide (nt) level (99.47%e99.74% nt identity for each genome) and to be closely related (99.60%e99.87%) to prototypes HBoV1 (NC_007455.1). A comparative analysis of the four HBoV1 genomes presented here and all available other HBoV genomes identified a total of three deletions within NP1 and VP1 together, which could be used to distinguishing HBoV1 from HBoV2e4. These differences include a 3-bp deletion in VP1 of HBoV1 at nucleotides 419e421, a 12-bp deletion in VP1 of HBoV2e4 at nucleotides 993e996 and 1004e1011, and a 3-bp deletion in NP1 of HBoV2e4 at nucleotides 88e90 (Fig. 3) . To further investigate the potential implications of VP1 variations in HBoV1, relative to HBoV2e4, we generated a 3D model of HBoV1 VP1 based on the crystal structure of a capsid viral protein of Adeno-associated virus (PDB code: 4IOV) (Fig. 4) . According to the previous report, 27 the structure of VP1 contains two parts: the capsid exterior and capsid interior. The unique substitutions and insertions (residues 334e337) within HBoV1 compared to HBoV2e4 mapped primarily to the capsid exterior. Interestingly, among the 32 unique substitutions, 19 were related with serine or threonine (substitutions of S/T with other amino acids), which has a dramatic influence on the hydrophobicity of the protein. These consensus nucleotide deletions or substitutions can be used to distinguish HBoV1 from HBoV2e4 and may be associated with pathogenicity of HBoV.",

Furthermore, the unique substitutions within HBoV1 relatively to HBoV2e4 mapped primarily to the capsid exterior.
