The regular treating in similarity comparison about genome is to discover the evolution distance among different genomes. Few people focus their attention on the overall statistical characteristics of each gene compared with other genes in the same genome. In our model, each genome is attributed to a weighted graph, whose topology describes the similarity relationship among genes in the same genome. Based on the related weighted graph theory, we extract some quantified statistical variables from the topology, and give the distribution of some variables derived from the largest social structure in the topology. The 23 eubacteria recently studied by Sorimachi and Okayasu are markedly classified into two different groups by their double logarithmic point-plots describing the similarity relationship among genes of the largest social structure in genome. The results show that the proposed model may provide us with some new sights to understand the structures and evolution patterns determined from the complete genomes.",

Facing the explosive growth of DNA and protein sequences, experimental, mathematical and graphical approaches have been employed to study the structure, function, evolution and attribution (Chou, 2011) of these sequences. As a powerful tool, the graphical methods can help people gain useful insights in an intuitive or visual manner. Many graphic approaches have been successfully used to study complicated biological topics, such as enzyme-catalyzed reactions (Chou, 1980 (Chou, , 1989 (Chou, , 1990 Forsen, 1980, 1981; Chou and Liu, 1981; Andraos, 2008) , protein folding kinetics (Chou, 1990; Chou and Shen, 2009; Shen et al., 2009) , drug metabolism kinetics (Chou, 2010) , analysis of codon usage Chou, 1993, 1994) , analysis of base frequencies in the anti-sense strands (Chou et al., 1996) , prediction of protein subcellular location (Xiao et al., 2006a, b) , HBV virus gene missense mutation (Xiao et al., 2005) , hepatitis B viral infections (Xiao et al., 2006a, b) , G-protein coupled receptors (Lin et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2009a Xiao et al., , 2011 and prediction of protein structure (Xiao et al., 2008a (Xiao et al., ,b, 2009b (Xiao et al., ,c, 2010 .

The overall statistical results about similarity degree are called as self-similarity characteristic of genome. The self-similarity analysis of genome can discover some interesting biological information hidden in genome. Generally, gene evolution includes three main approaches: gene point mutation, gene recombination and horizontal gene transfer (Syvanen and Kado, 2002) . The same result from different evolution approaches is that every gene of genome perhaps has its similar genes within the same genome. If one gene has many similar genes within genome, it is relatively active in its evolution pathway. Otherwise, this gene is comparatively conservative. Then, how many active genes does a genome have? What differences do there exist among different genomes? Here, we introduce weighted graph method to investigate these problems about the 23 eubacteria genome studied in Sorimachi and Okayasu (2004) and . The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the self-similarity analysis model of genome based on weighted graph and some statistical information of this model.

Recently, two seminal models about graph theory, ''small-world'' network (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) and ''BA'' network (Barab\u00e1 si and Albert, 1999) were proposed. The models brought about the naissance of complex networks theory as a new branch about graph theory. In the past ten years, the new branch received an increasing attention. Here, we introduce weighted graph theory to investigate the self-similarity characteristics of the 23 eubacteria genomes. In a weighted graph, a specific value is associated with each connection and the value describes the strength of the connection. An adjacency matrix corresponding to a weighted graph is a weight matrix. The weight is used to describe the strength of each different links.

The connection (or link) between any pair of nodes is represented as their interaction and correlation. As for a genome with n genes, the number of the vertexes and the links are n and C 2 n \u00bc \u00f0n\u00f0n\u00c01\u00de=2\u00de, respectively. Fig. 1 shows how a graph is constructed according to a genome, where G i denotes the ith gene, i \u00bc 1,2,. . .,n. Fig. 1 is a full-connected graph because there is a connection between any pair of genes. Then a specific value is assigned to each connection to describe the similarity degree between two genes. There are several methods such as BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997 ; http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bl2seq/wblast2.cgi) and Smith-Waterman algorithm-needle (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970;  http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/align/index.html) to calculate the similarity of two genes. The schemes ensure the optimal local alignment by exploring all possible alignments and choosing the best. The gap insertion penalty, gap extension penalty and substitution matrix used to calculate the alignments are specified. We do not choose the global alignment algorithms because they perhaps produce some results but much of the alignments may have little or no biological significance. Here, we use BLAST, a local alignment algorithm, to calculate the similarity degree of two genes by the consideration for speed and efficiency. The similarity degree of any pair of genes in genome is determined by BLAST (bl2seq) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bl2seq/ wblast2.cgi) for pairwise protein-protein sequence comparison. The detailed view for each segment of alignment includes the statistics with the percentage of identities, positives and gaps, schematic view, and the text alignment view. We can obtain the detailed statistics information for two closely related sequences by BLAST (bl2seq) with a given expectation value (E-value). As for two distantly related sequences, we cannot possibly get any statistics information. There are no similar areas between the two sequences. In order to simplify the graph structure, we remove the links with zero value from the weighted graph. Similarly, the node is also removed from the graph if a node has no any links connected to other nodes. Then in the graph, every link is associated with a real value derived from the detailed statistics information by BLAST (bl2seq) with a given E-value. The graph becomes a weighted graph related to a genome. For example, Fig. 2 (a) shows all links of the gene ''gi93322290'' of Treponema pallidum connected to other genes by BLAST (bl2seq) with E-value 0.001. We extract the E-value from the detailed statistics information as the weighted value. Fig. 2 (b) illustrates the overall weighted graph related to Treponema pallidum by Pajek (http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/ pub/networks/pajek/). In order to clarify the figure, in Fig. 2 (b) we do not illustrate the E-values related to links.",

The E-value derived from the detailed statistics information by BLAST (bl2seq) is used to describe the similarity degree between genes. It is well known that E-value is a statistical calculation based on the score that gives the number of hits of this score that this search would return by chance using a database of this size. According to BLAST tutorial, if the E-value is less than 1\u00c2 10 \u00c0 50 , the hit is very similar to the query sequence and is very likely to be evolutionarily related. If the E-value is between 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 50 and 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 2 , the hit has some similarity to the query sequence and may be related. The E-values in the range can indicate that the sample sequence is in the same family as the hit or it may have closely related functional domains. Here we set the E-value less than 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 3 to obtain results that are more reasonable. Now, we obtain the detailed statistics information for two sequences by BLAST (bl2seq) with a given E-value threshold. We choose the best High-scoring segment pair (HSP) when there are many hits in an alignment. The reported results still include other outcomes besides E-value such as Score, Identities and Positives. Obviously, only the E-value does not fully reflect the similarity degree between genes. Here, we analyze the reported results by BLAST (bl2seq) in order to obtain a weighted value (w-value) to describe the similarity degree. Table 2 lists some alignment results of the gene ''gi93322290'' of Treponema pallidum by BLAST (bl2seq) with E-value threshold 0.001.

There are only three species with a percentage less than 60%. These data indicate that most of genes in genome are relatively active in their evolution pathways. As for a genome, it is impossible for point mutation to reach so large social structures. The statistic data give a possible explanation that some genes continuously exchange some segments each other. Perhaps segment reassortment (or recombination) and association in genome, that is to say, are the main evolutionary approaches. (ii) In the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth column of the table, we calculate the statistic information about the largest one in all social structures. The statistic data shows that the genes in the largest social structure occupy the majority proportion of complete genome. The other social structures only occupy a small percentage in genome except for the largest social structure. The statistic data shows that most of genes in genome are associated with each other. The ninth column in the table illustrates the average number of links of every gene in the largest social structure. Obviously, the genes are more active when their links are high. The species with the largest number of connections is Clostridium perfringens 13 in which the average number of links reaches 6.96.

A gene with a large degree means that it may be a more active gene. Some segments in the gene may be transferred to other genes, or come from other genes by gene recombination. Let k i be the degree of node (gene) i in the largest social structure. Then we can use distribution function P(k) to describe the degree distribution of node in the graph. The distribution function P(k) denotes that the probability of the node degree is just k as for a randomly chosen node. The patterns of the distribution function P(k) based on the complete genomes of various eubacteria are 'double logarithmic point-plot', as shown in Fig. 3 . Double logarithmic point-plot: The logarithm of a number to a given base is the exponent to which the base must be raised in order to produce that number. For example, the logarithm of 1000 to base 10 is 3, because three factors of 10 must be multiplied to yield a thousand: 10 \u00c2 10 \u00c2 10, also written as 10 3 , equals 1000. The double logarithmic point-plot is a figure in which all data points are plotted on the logarithmic scales on both axes. Here, the distribution function P(k) possibly ranges from 10 \u00c0 4 to 1. The parameter k ranges from 1 to 10 3 . The data-points plotted on linear scales (Cartesian coordinate system) would be very close to the axes. Therefore, for sake of comparison, all data points are plotted on the logarithmic scales on both axes, as shown in Fig. 3 .",

However, in Fig. 4 the species has a pattern with an approximation of the power distribution instead of the upward tail in Fig. 3 .

This shows that these genes are relatively active and perhaps exchanged gene pieces with quite a number of other ones in their evolution pathways. Yet the pattern as shown in Fig. 4 means that the similarities between the genes are low. There are two possible reasons to explain the special phenomenon about Bacillus subtilis. One is that the scale of the exchanged gene pieces between different genes is relatively small. The other is that it perhaps takes so much time that the further evolution reduces the similarity degree among the exchanged gene pieces.",

In this model, a genome is attributed to a weighted graph to express the relationship among similar genes in the same genome. Then the weighted graphs are used to investigate the self-similarity characteristics of different genomes from 23 eubacteria. Unlike the studies of the 23 eubacteria in Sorimachi and Okayasu (2004) and , here they are markedly classified into two different groups by their double logarithmic point-plots describing the similarity relations among genes of the largest social structure in genome. One group is the eubacteria similar to the power law distribution, such as Campylobacter jejuni and Helicobacter pylori J99. The other includes the eubacteria with an upward tail at the end of the double logarithmic point-plot, such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus Mu50. The results show that the proposed model may provide us with some new sights to understand the structures and evolution patterns determined from the complete genomes.",
