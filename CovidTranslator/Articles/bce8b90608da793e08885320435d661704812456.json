However, consumption theories predict that a shift in demand can be induced without changes in actual earnings when expectations for future income are adjusted. This presumes demand for international tourism can be influenced by \"wealth effects\" from real estate and financial assets. This study tested for the wealth effect on Korean outbound travelers during the 20 years between 1989 and 2009. Korea is a unique place to examine in that Korean households possess housing assets and financial assets that are traded actively in markets. The results of this study favored the possibility of a significant wealth effect from housing on outbound travel demand, but not from financial assets. This may be explained by data sensitivity and the relative importance of financial assets in the Korean people's wealth portfolios. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided along with the findings of the study.",

Although it is unrealistic to think that expenditures on overseas travel could precede day-to-day necessities, the assumption in the literature directly follows a syllogism based on two fundamental premises. First, it is widely acknowledged that international tourism is considered a luxury good rather than a normal good (Lim, 1997) , in that tourists must commit significant expenditures on costly goods such as airfare and hotels (Bakkal & Scaperlanda, 1991) . Second, since it is a luxury good, demand should be dependent on the discretionary income of consumers (Crouch, 1992) , which is the proportion of real earnings after normal expenses (i.e. food, living, medical) are deducted.",

Concurrent with evidence that international tourism is indeed a luxury good, a number of studies have advocated using real discretionary or disposable income in tourism demand models whenever it is available rather than crude income per capita variants, such as Gross Domestic Product or Gross National Income (Durbarry and Sinclair, 2003; Lim, 1997; Song, Romilly, & Liu, 2000) .",

Despite the high significance and compelling results (Crouch, 1996) of said income variables, it is still possible that other income-related factors play a role in determining international tourism demand. Certainly, the absolute availability of cash flows is likely to place a strict upper limit on tourism demand. If an individual or household does not have the wealth to purchase luxury goods, without doubt there will be less consumption. Yet, we cannot safely extend this logic to suggest that demand will consistently lead to the consumption of tourism goods or travel by using a constant proportion of discretionary income.",

The way in which changes in the value of these two prominent asset classes impact consumption is popularly known as the 'wealth effect.' The \"wealth effect\" has been examined numerous times since the seminal work done by Ando and Modigliani (1963) and has been empirically validated to some extent (Case, Quigley, & Shiller, 2005) . Nevertheless, there have been mixed results (Attanasio, Blow, Hamilton, & Leicester, 2009) , as well as ongoing discussions and efforts by researchers to scrutinize the relationship between consumption and unrealized wealth. Modigliani (1971) suggested that, holding labor income fixed, a wealth gain of a dollar increases consumer spending by five cents roughly. Carroll (2004) affirmed the wealth effect of both housing and wealth on consumption, with housing (non-financial) wealth having a greater influence on consumption. Case et al. (2005) concluded that there was a significant increase in consumption explained by gains in housing and financial wealth in the US. However, contradicting results have also been reported. Elliott (1980) concluded that only financial assets affect consumption, while both Skinner (1989) and Levin (1998) argued against the wealth effect from housing. Lettau and Ludvigson (2004) contended that most changes in asset values are \"transitory and unrelated\" to aggregate consumption. Differences were also found across countries. Case et al. (2005) found a significant housing wealth effect for a panel of 14 developed countries, but an insignificant financial wealth effect. Likewise, Campbell and Cocco (2007) observed a relatively large housing wealth effect using micro data in the UK.",

For example, an increase in housing prices may lead to enhanced expectations of future wealth (or in some cases an actual gain should the house be sold) for home owners. At the same time, housing costs such as rent would generally increase along with housing prices. Consequently, an increase in housing prices would imply a net negative wealth effect for those who do not own their homes. This part of demand may decrease consumption based on unfavorable expectations regarding future income and costs. Another example can be drawn from Ogawa, Kitasaka, Yamaoka, and Iwata (1996) , who found that the liquidity of unrealized wealth is also an important determinant of consumption. Even if the asset appreciates the owners may not view it as a capital gain due to illiquidity of the asset, a lack of information on reference prices, or consumption needs such as continued residence.",

This is intuitive as the amount of investment is likely to determine the potential income or return, and therefore govern expectations for future income. Also, Poterba (2000) posited that \"wealth elasticities\" may differ by product type, arguing that household consumption affected by wealth gains from the stock market mainly consisted of luxury goods.

In order to evenly distribute the wealth effect of price gains across individuals or households, various income classes must hold approximately equal proportions of non-financial and financial assets. A significant absolute amount of wealth should also be invested in these assets, even by low income households. Further, the asset's value should remain relatively stable over time and be traded constantly while price information needs to be consistently disseminated. In order to ensure that owners actively respond to the wealth effect by changing consumption patterns, the effect on luxury goods should be tested rather than normal or inferior goods. Although participation in international tourism is likely to be regarded as a luxury good for the most part, it is difficult to presume that on average those individuals and households who engage in international tourism have considerable investments in similar assets that are consistently traded in the market.",

The Korean residential market is dominated by a unique housing type referred to as 'apartments,' which are analogous to condominiums in the US (Ham & Lee, 2010) . Consistent price increases have led Korean apartments to become an actively traded asset in the wealth portfolios of middle-class households. Information on prices and rents are readily available (Hwang, Quigley, & Son, 2006) . According to the National Statistics Office of Korea, in 2006 the wealth of Korean households was deeply concentrated in real estate (76.8%) and financial assets (20.4%), while other assets accounted for only 2.7 percent. In essence, the wealth of the Korean people is concentrated in just two asset types, which are broadly held and actively traded with accurate and immediate dissemination of price information.",

It is crucial to examine this causal relationship in order to improve our understanding of deterministic tourism demand models (Song & Li, 2008) . Although the wealth effect may not be universal or present in every economy, in cases where tourism demand is significantly affected by not only current earnings but also expectations on future earnings, estimation of tourism consumption behavior based on contemporaneous income may be erroneous. In turn, misunderstanding consumption behaviors implies ineffective and misguided pricing and marketing strategies for tourism products and targeting of demand segments. Moreover, by identifying another driver of tourism efficiency in demand forecasting and modeling may be improved. Implications and suggestions are presented along with the findings of the study.",

Apartments are highly standardized in terms of amenities, floor plans, and building materials. The housing market shares similar expectations when information on an apartment's location, size, and year built are provided. Homogeneous expectations combined with low transaction costs have led to easy trading and rental of apartments among individuals. As a result, the Korean apartment market is deeper and more active than most other housing markets (Hwang et al., 2006) . This high volume of active trading and ease of comparability facilitate the construction and dissemination of reliable reference prices.

Average household income and apartment sales price index were initially obtained as monthly data and were aggregated into quarterly observations for consistency. The Singapore Kerosene-Type Jet Fuel spot price is the Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS), used as the jet fuel price index by most airlines in Asia. The sample period starts in 1989, which is the first year the Korean government relaxed restrictions on international travel. Fig. 1 illustrates the trends of data series. Summary statistics and Pearson correlations of the data are provided in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. All the variables tend to be highly correlated, as they are collectively subject to greater movements of the economy and common causality. There are two noteworthy observations to be made based on the data in the figure and tables. Price appreciation, and, therefore, cumulative returns on apartments, were greater than stocks during the sample period, while at the same time the movements were less volatile. In effect, it is possible that the appreciation of apartments is more likely to be perceived as a permanent gain in wealth than stock appreciation. It should also to be noted that incomes and the prices of apartments and stocks are highly and significantly correlated. When the wealth effect is significant, omitting asset variables and including only income as an explanatory variable is likely to cause a misspecification bias, which would result in overestimation of the income elasticity of demand.",

Following a popular approach, the number of outbound tourist departures was used to measure tourism demand. Income and purchasing power parities were expected to be significant in the model (Song & Li, 2008) . The hypotheses regarding the wealth effect from financial and housing assets were tested by coefficients on KOSPI and APT,b 3 andb 4 , respectively. Following Wang's (2009) approach, jet fuel price was used as a proxy for airfare while binary variables controlled for the effects of macro socioeconomic events on tourism demand, namely the Asian Financial Crisis, the September 11th Attack, and spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The use of a log-linear model allows easy interpretation of the results as the elasticity of demand where the units of data for the current study are difficult to interpret (Wang, 2009 ), while the log-linear form is also widely advocated for its robustness against heteroscedasticity (Wang, 1995) .",

Although including the lagged dependent variable does not create a bias in the coefficients, it is expected to underestimate the variance of the estimator in the presence of positive autocorrelation, thereby overstating the significance of the coefficients (Wooldridge, 2002) . In order to conduct an efficient estimation and obtain reliable results, the current study implemented two different estimation techniques: PraiseWinsten and ordinary least squares (OLS) with NeweyeWest standard errors. Estimators and statistics from the PraiseWinsten procedure are asymptotically efficient and valid for autoregressive models of the first-order, while the NeweyeWest procedure provides a robust inference of serial correlations of a higher-order (Traub & Jayne, 2004) . More specifically, if the model to be estimated includes a first-order autoregressive disturbance term, the PraiseWinsten method transforms the error vector that yields serially uncorrelated classical disturbances (Baltagi, Song, Jung, & Koh, 2007) . In the presence of higher-order lags, the New-eyeWest method allows for the robust inference of standard errors on the coefficients (Ferson, Sarkissian, & Simin, 2003) and is standard in the economics literature (Greene, 2008) .",

The insignificant results could also be attributed to inefficient estimation; quarterly data may have insufficient sensitivity as stock prices are highly volatile in nature, as seen in Fig. 1 . Yet another possibility is that the wealth effect from financial assets could be insignificant at the aggregate level. This may be due to a comparably low allocation of relative wealth in the stock market, which accounts for less than 20% of total household wealth, whereas housing assets account for more than 75%. The smaller amount of total investments in equity stocks, which resulted in a trivial absolute increase in expected wealth, may also account for the result (Cho, 2006) .",

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) decreased outbound travel demand by approximately 4 percent. A possible explanation for the insignificant coefficient of the 9/11 DUMMY variable is the effect of substitution to other destinations. Although trips to the US from Korea significantly declined immediately after the 9/11 attack, total outbound demand may have been sustained by substituting other nearby destinations, such as Southeast Asia or Oceania, that had a relatively lower perceived risk of terrorism (Lim, 2004) .",

Even though the wealth effect may only be conditionally present for certain economies and asset types, Korean economy tourism demand can be partly explained by appreciation in housing assets. For example, tourist surveys often utilize the income levels of tourists to explain tourism demand or expenditure (Jang, Bai, Hong, & O'Leary, 2004; Jang, Ismail, & Ham, 2002) . However, in order to produce more efficient estimates of income and/or price effects on tourism goods, changes in net assets and the relative location of a person in the society's wealth distribution curve can be taken into account. Income and wealth variables are likely to be correlated with one another since they are both subject to the greater movements of the national economy. This suggests that efficiency of conventional tourism demand models can be enhanced and their accuracy improved by utilizing important wealth variables. ",
