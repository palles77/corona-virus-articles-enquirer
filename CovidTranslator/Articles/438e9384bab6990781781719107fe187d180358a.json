To compare its pathogenesis with that of previously emerging coronaviruses, we inoculated cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV and compared with historical SARS-CoV infections. In SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques, virus was 5 excreted from nose and throat in absence of clinical signs, and detected in type I and II pneumocytes in foci of diffuse alveolar damage and mucous glands of the nasal cavity. In SARS-CoV-infection, lung lesions were typically more severe, while they were milder in MERS-CoV infection, where virus was detected mainly in type II pneumocytes. These data show that SARS-CoV-2 can cause a COVID-19-like disease, and suggest that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection 10 is intermediate between that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",

As of March 14, 2020, over 140,000 cases were reported worldwide with over 20 5,400 deaths, surpassing the combined number of cases and deaths of two previously emerging coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (3) . COVID-19 is characterized by a range of symptoms, including fever, cough, dyspnoea and myalgia in most cases (2). In severe cases, bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity is the most common chest CT finding (4) . Similar to the 2002/2003 outbreak of SARS, severity of COVID-19 disease is associated with 25 increased age and/or a comorbidity, although severe disease is not limited to these risk groups (5) . However, despite the large number of cases and deaths, limited information is available on the pathogenesis of this virus infection. Two reports on the histological examination of the lungs of three patients showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), pulmonary oedema and hyaline membrane formation, indicative of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as 30 characteristic syncytial cells in the alveolar lumen (6, 7) , similar to findings during the 2002/2003 outbreak of SARS-CoV (8) . The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection was previously studied in a non-human primate model where aged animals were more likely to develop disease (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . In the current study, SARS-CoV-2 infection was characterized in the same animal model, using cynomolgus macaques, and compared with infection with MERS-CoV and historical data on 35 SARS-CoV (9, 10, 12) .",

Virus replication was primarily restricted to the respiratory tract (nasal cavity, trachea, bronchi and lung lobes) with highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in lungs (Fig.  1C) . Interestingly, in three out of four animals, SARS-CoV-RNA was also detected in ileum and tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes (Fig. 1C) . 25 The main histological lesion in the consolidated pulmonary tissue involved the alveoli and bronchioles, and consisted of areas with acute or more advanced DAD (Fig. 2B ). In these areas, the lumina of alveoli and bronchioles were variably filled with protein-rich oedema fluid, fibrin, and cellular debris, a moderate number of alveolar macrophages, and fewer neutrophils and lymphocytes ( Fig. 2C -E). There was epithelial necrosis with extensive loss of epithelium from 30 alveolar and bronchiolar walls. Hyaline membranes were present in a few damaged alveoli. In areas with more advanced lesions, the alveolar walls were moderately thickened and lined by cuboidal epithelial cells (type II pneumocyte hyperplasia), and the alveolar lumina were empty. Alveolar and bronchiolar walls were thickened by oedema fluid, mononuclear cells, and neutrophils. There were aggregates of lymphocytes around small pulmonary vessels. Moderate 35 numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages were present in the lamina propria and submucosa of the bronchial walls, and a few neutrophils in the bronchial epithelium. Regeneration of epithelium was seen in some bronchioles, visible as an irregular layer of squamous to high cuboidal epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. There were occasional multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) free in the lumina of bronchioles and alveoli (Fig. 2F) , and, based on positive pan-keratin staining and 40 negative CD68 staining, originated from epithelial cells (Fig. 2F, inset) .

S2 ). The pattern of staining was similar to that in lung tissue from SARS-CoV-infected macaques (positive control). SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression was not observed in any of the syncytia. In the upper respiratory tract, there was focal or locally extensive SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression in epithelial cells of mucous glands in the 5 nasal cavity (septum or concha) of all four macaques, without any associated histological lesions ( fig. 2I ).",

Increased age did not affect disease outcome, but there was prolonged viral shedding 35 in the upper respiratory tract of aged animals. Prolonged shedding has been observed in both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV patients (14, 15) . Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 in our model, peaked early in the course of infection, similar to what is seen in patients (14) . This earlier peak in virus shedding for SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to influenza virus shedding (16) than SARS-CoV, where shedding peaked around day 10 post onset of symptoms (15) , and may explain why case 40 detection and isolation may not be as effective for SARS-CoV-2 as it was for the control of SARS-CoV (17) .

Viral tropism for the nasal mucosa fits with efficient respiratory transmission, as has been seen for influenza A virus (18) . SARS-CoV-2 was primarily detected in tissues of the respiratory tract, however SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also detectable in other tissues such as intestines, in line with a recent report (19). 5 Two out of four animals had foci of DAD on day 4 p.i. The colocalisation of SARS-CoV-2-antigen expression and DAD provides strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused this lesion. The histological character of the DAD, including alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial necrosis, alveolar oedema, hyaline membrane formation, and accumulation of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes, corresponds with the limited pathological analyses of human COVID-19 cases (6, 10 7). In particular, the presence of syncytia in the lung lesions is characteristic of respiratory coronavirus infections. Whereas MERS-CoV primarily infects type II pneumocytes in cynomolgus macaques, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 also infect type I pneumocytes. Injury to type I pneumocytes can result in pulmonary oedema, and formation of hyaline membranes (20) , which may explain why hyaline membrane formation is a hallmark for SARS and COVID-19 (7, 10), but The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.995639 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.995639 doi: bioRxiv preprint Fig. 3 .

These data show that cynomolgus macaques are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, shed virus for a prolonged period of time and display COVID-19-like disease. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused histopathological changes in the lungs that appeared to be intermediate in severity between those from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections established by similar inoculation doses and routes. 20 An in-depth comparison of infection with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in this model may identify key pathways in the pathogenesis of these emerging viruses. This study provides a novel infection model which will be critical in the evaluation and licensure of preventive and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection for use in humans, as well as evaluating the efficacy of repurposing species specific existing treatments, such as pegylated interferon (Shieh et al., Immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization, and ultrastructural localization of SARS-associated coronavirus in lung of a fatal case of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Taiwan.
