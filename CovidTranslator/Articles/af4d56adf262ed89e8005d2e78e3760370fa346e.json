Coronaviruses can emerge from animal reservoirs to cause significant epidemics in humans, as exemplified by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was recognized as an emerging virus in 2012 (1, 2) . A remarkable feature of many coronaviruses is their ability to infect macrophages and delay triggering of antiviral sensors that would otherwise activate production of type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) (3) (4) (5) . Coronaviruses encode multiple antagonists that likely impede or delay the activation of type I IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), thereby contributing to pathogenesis (6) . A recent report using SARS-CoV infection of mice documented that delayed IFN signaling contributes to disease (7) . The goal of this study was to identify viral factors that contribute to the delay in the activation of IFN in response to coronavirus infection.",

This model coronavirus replicates in multiple murine cell types, including macrophages, and can cause acute hepatitis or lethal encephalitis, depending on the site of injection. The viral genomic RNA comprises 32 kb. Two-thirds of the genome encodes a large replicase polyprotein, whereas the remainder of the genome codes for structural proteins and strain-specific accessory proteins (Fig. 1A) . The replicase polyprotein is processed by viral proteases into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) that assemble in the host endoplasmic reticulum to generate convoluted membranes and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), which are the sites of viral RNA synthesis (8, 9) . Coronavirus RNA replication proceeds via the generation of a nested set of negative-strand RNAs that serve as templates for synthesis of mRNAs and new positive-strand genomes (10) . Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates, which are potent stimulators of cytoplasmic innate sensors, are produced during this process and associate with the DMVs (9) . A potential function for coronavirus DMVs may be to sequester viral dsRNA away from host dsRNA sensors; however, it is unclear if DMVs alone are sufficient to prevent activation of the host innate immune response. Here we report that coronavirus nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15), a highly conserved nidovirus component with endoribonuclease activity, acts in conjunction with the viral replication complex to limit the exposure of viral dsRNA to host dsRNA sensors.",

            "text": "Bioinformatic analysis revealed that nsp15 contains a domain with distant homology to cellular endoribonucleases. The nsp15 endoribonuclease, termed NendoU, is highly conserved among vertebrate nidoviruses (coronaviruses and arteriviruses) (11) . Structural and biochemical studies revealed that the SARS-CoV and MHV nsp15, and the arterivirus ortholog nsp11, form oligomers to cleave RNA molecules with a preference for the 3\u2032-ends of uridylates (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . The role of endoribonuclease activity in nidovirus replication and pathogenesis, however, is not well understood. In one study, researchers were unable to recover human coronavirus 229E encoding an endoribonuclease catalytic site mutant, and therefore concluded that nsp15 was essential for Significance Macrophages are immune cells equipped with multiple doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) sensors designed to detect viral infection and amplify innate antiviral immunity. However, many coronaviruses can infect and propagate in macrophages without activating dsRNA sensors. Here we present a function of murine coronavirus nonstructural protein 15 in preventing detection of viral dsRNA by host sensors. We show that coronaviruses expressing a mutant form of nonstructural protein 15 allow for activation of dsRNA sensors, resulting in an early induction of interferon, rapid apoptosis of macrophages, and a protective immune response in mice. Identifying the strategies used by viruses to evade detection provides us with new approaches for generating vaccines that elicit robust innate immune responses and protective immunity.",

On the other hand, MHV encoding nsp15 catalytic site mutations replicated to reduced titers (\u223c1 log) in a fibroblast cell line (18) , suggesting that nsp15 activity is important but not required for MHV replication. Similarly, mutagenesis studies of arterivirus nsp11 yielded a range of results: some mutations could not be recovered in viable virus, whereas others allowed recovery with a range of phenotypes (19, 20) . Overexpression studies of coronavirus nsp15 (21) and arterivirus nsp11 (20, 22, 23) demonstrated antagonism of innate immune responses, but there was no direct evidence to suggest that these proteins counteract innate immunity in the context of viral infection. Here we report that nsp15 is not required for viral RNA synthesis per se, but acts to mediate evasion of host dsRNA sensors. Viruses that contain a mutation in nsp15, which either renders nsp15 unstable or disables endoribonuclease activity, stimulate MDA5-dependent IFN production and activate host dsRNA sensors. The nsp15 mutant viruses induce apoptotic cell death and exhibit reduced replication in macrophages. Importantly, we show that nsp15 is a key component of coronavirus pathogenesis, highlighted by loss of dissemination of nsp15 mutant viruses to target organs and an absence of pathology in mice. We show that nsp15 mutant viruses can elicit a protective immune response against subsequent challenge with WT virus.",

The parental WT MHV-A59 (termed MHV-WT) and all mutant viruses were generated using reverse genetics (24) and were subjected to deep sequencing to validate the genotypes. N15m3 contains an alanine substitution in the catalytic histidine (H262A) residue of nsp15, which was previously shown to inactivate endoribonuclease activity (17, 25) . N15m1 contains a methionine substitution at a highly-conserved threonine residue (T98M) and an alanine substitution at arginine-971 (R971A) in nsp3 ( Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A ). We also generated a mutant virus with a single substitution in nsp3 (R971A), termed N3m, to distinguish the effect of the substitution in nsp3 from the substitution in nsp15 of N15m1 virus. To date, we have been unable to isolate a virus containing only the T98M substitution, which may indicate that additional substitutions are necessary to stabilize the T98M mutant virus.",

We report that infection of BMDMs generated from C57BL/6 mice (B6) with nsp15 mutant viruses resulted in limited production of progeny virus and more rapid cell death compared with WT virus infection ( Fig. 1 B and C and Fig. S1D ). This result is in contrast to the robust replication of MHV-WT and N3m, which replicate to high titers in BMDMs with minimal cell death as late as 24 h postinfection (hpi) (Fig. 1 B and C and Fig. S1D ). Efficient replication of the nsp15 mutant viruses was restored in BMDMs generated from mice with a knockout of the type I IFN receptor (ifnar \u2212/\u2212 ) (Fig.  1D ). In the absence of IFN signaling, all tested viruses induced similar cell death kinetics ( Fig. S1C and Fig. S1E ). These results implicate type I IFN signaling as a major contributor to the replication deficiency of nsp15 mutants.

Given the importance of IFN signaling in controlling nsp15 mutant virus infection of macrophages, we hypothesize that WT nsp15 antagonizes the type I IFN system. To address this question, B6 BMDMs were infected with MHV-WT or mutant viruses and harvested at 8, 12, and 16 hpi to evaluate the level of IFN-\u03b1mRNA and protein. We found that the nsp15 mutant viruses stimulated an early and more robust induction of IFN-\u03b1 compared with MHV-WT or N3m virus (Fig. 2) . IFN-\u03b1 mRNA was significantly elevated at 8 hpi in nsp15 mutant-infected cells, with WT or N3m virus requiring 12 hpi to reach similar levels ( Fig. 2A) . The detection of IFN-\u03b1 mRNA in nsp15 mutant virus-infected cells peaked at 12 hpi and was slightly reduced at 16 hpi ( Fig. 2A ), corresponding to a reduction in the number of viable cells (Fig. 1C ). We noted a significant reduction in the level of nucleocapsid (N) gene mRNA in nsp15 mutant virus-infected cells at 12 and 16 hpi (Fig. 2B) , time points when IFN-\u03b1 expression was significantly elevated ( Fig.  2A) . The concentration of IFN-\u03b1 protein was significantly higher in cell supernatants obtained from nsp15 mutant-infected cells, compared with WT-or N3m-infected cells (Fig. 2C) . Additionally, increased detection of ISG54 in N15m1-infected cells was observed using immunofluorescence (Fig. S2A ). Consistent with a previous report (26) , activation of IFN during MHV infection was dependent on production of MDA5 (encoded by the ifih1 gene), as BMDMs derived from ifih1 \u2212/\u2212 mice did not express IFN when infected by either WT or mutant viruses ( Fig. 2D and Fig. S2B ). Overall, these results demonstrate that nsp15 mutant viruses stimulate an early and robust type I IFN response in B6 BMDMs, indicating that nsp15 functions as a type I IFN antagonist during MHV infection.",

Because we observed rapid cell death in nsp15 mutant-infected macrophages ( Fig. 1C and Fig. S1D) , we investigated the cell death pathways triggered during viral replication. We first evaluated the effects of various inhibitors on virus-infected cells. The pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD (27) prevented virus-induced cell death (Fig. 3A ). In contrast, neither Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), a receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) inhibitor (28) , nor caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 (29) , prevented virus-induced cell death (Fig. 3A) . These data suggest that infection of BMDMs by nsp15 mutant viruses activates apoptotic cell death rather than RIPK1/RIPK3-dependent necroptosis or caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis (30, 31) . However, we note that zVAD-a cysteine protease inhibitor-may also affect viral replication (32) ; therefore, we investigated other hallmarks of apoptotic cell death, including the activation of caspase-3/7. We observed enhanced caspase-3/7 activity in nsp15 mutant virus-infected BMDMs (Fig. 3B) . Furthermore, increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 products were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 3C ). Finally, condensed chromatin and nuclear fragmentation were observed by electron microscopy in nsp15 mutant-infected cells, but not in BMDMs infected by MHV-WT (Fig. S3A ). Taken together, these data demonstrate that nsp15 mutant viruses trigger early apoptosis in macrophages.",

We found that IFN-\u03b1 treatment did not induce caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. S3B ). Furthermore, no elevated caspase-3/7 activity was observed in BMDMs treated with UV-inactivated supernatant, which contained replication-defective virus and IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. S3B) . These results indicate that active virus replication, and not IFN-\u03b1 alone, is required for induction of apoptosis. Using a complementary approach, we evaluated virus-induced apoptosis in ifih1 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs. These cells lack MDA5 expression and, as shown in Fig. 2D , do not induce IFN during viral infection. However, other dsRNA-sensing pathways remain intact in these cells. We found that infection of ifih1 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs with nsp15 mutant viruses induced elevated levels of caspase-3/7, which promoted rapid cell death ( Fig. 3 D and E) . These results implicate a non-MDA5-dependent pathway as an additional mechanism in the induction of apoptosis. Taken together, these data indicate that nsp15 mutant virus infection can activate multiple independent dsRNA-sensing pathways to induce apoptotic cell death.",

            "text": "MHV nsp15 Mutant Viruses Activate Host dsRNA Sensors. Because our data suggest that additional dsRNA-sensing pathways are activated in response to nsp15 mutant virus replication, we investigated other dsRNA-sensing pathways that have been linked to apoptotic cell death. To this end, we examined the protein kinase R (PKR) and the 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/ RNase L systems (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) . First, we evaluated the level of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, an indicator of PKR activation (35, 37) , during infection. Increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 was observed in BMDMs infected with nsp15 mutant viruses compared with infection with WT virus (Fig. 4A ). Addition of C16, a specific kinase inhibitor of PKR (38) , significantly reduced the levels of caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. 4B ) and prevented cell death (Fig.  S4A ). These data suggest that the PKR pathway is activated during MHV infection of BMDMs. We also assessed the degradation of RNA, which is an indicator of active 2\u2032-5\u2032 OAS/ RNase L system signaling (39) . Degradation of RNA was observed as early as 8 hpi in cells infected with the nsp15 mutant viruses, but not in cells infected by MHV-WT or N3m (Fig. 4C and Fig. S4B ). Degradation of RNA was not inhibited by blocking apoptosis with either zVAD or C16 (Fig. 4D ). This result indicated that activation of OAS/RNase L was independent of PKR activation. In addition, robust RNA degradation was observed in nsp15 mutant virus-infected ifih1 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs (Fig. S4C) , suggesting that the OAS/RNase L system was Values were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA test by time in A-C or an unpaired t test in D. *P < 0.05; n.s., not significant. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. Data are representative of two to three independent experiments and presented as the mean \u00b1 SD. Red dashed line is limit of detection. activated in the absence of IFN. Finally, neither RNA degradation (Fig. S4D ) nor elevated caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. S4E ) was observed in ifnar \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs despite the fact that robust viral replication was present (Fig. 1D ). This could be because of low basal expression of PKR (Fig. S4F ) and OAS in ifnar \u2212/\u2212 macrophages, the latter of which was previously reported (40) . Taken together, these data indicate that nsp15 mutant viruses activate multiple independent host dsRNA-sensing systems in macrophages, including MDA5, PKR, and OAS/RNase L. In the absence of functional nsp15, the collective stimulation of these pathways by viral dsRNA results in robust type I IFN induction, apoptotic cell death, and severely reduced viral titer.",

Because the N15m1 mutant virus is unique to this study, we investigated the effect of the T98M mutation on the nsp15 protein. The T98M mutation resides at the interface between the N-terminal domain and middle domain of nsp15 (Fig. 1A , Right). The endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 requires the formation of stable oligomers, which may be destabilized by the T98M mutation (25) . Western blot analysis revealed that levels of nsp15 were significantly reduced in both N15m1-and N15m3infected cells compared with WT-infected cells (Fig. 5A, Left) . It is possible that this phenotype could be because of the limited viral replication of nsp15 mutant viruses observed in B6 BMDMs or reduced detection of nsp15 mutant proteins by antiserum. However, compared with N15m3, the level of N15m1 nsp15 protein remained low during infection of ifnar \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs, despite similar N protein levels (Fig. 5A , Right) and growth kinetics for all viruses tested (Fig.  1D ). We also note that detection of nsp15 protein by antiserum was not affected by the T98M mutation, as both recombinant WT and T98M nsp15 were equally detectable (Fig. 5B, Lower) . These results suggest that the T98M mutation destabilizes nsp15, resulting in a decrease in the steady-state level of the protein in N15m1infected cells.",

Based on the structure of nsp15, the SUMO tag will not affect the assembly of oligomers, including hexamers, as previously reported (12) (13) (14) . To determine if the T98M mutation destabilizes the protein, differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was used to measure the stability of nsp15 in response to heat (41) . DSF assesses the denaturation of proteins in the presence of a hydrophobic dye that will fluoresce upon binding to hydrophobic protein sequences. This technique has been used to monitor interactions between viral protein subunits (42) . WT nsp15 undergoes a major transition to the denatured state at 47\u00b0C (Fig. 5C ). In contrast, the T98M mutant denatured at 40\u00b0C, 7\u00b0C lower than the WT nsp15, which is consistent with our hypothesis that the T98M mutation renders nsp15 less stable. Using dynamic lightscatter spectrometry, we report that the majority of WT nsp15 assembles to form oligomers at a protein concentration of Values were analyzed using two-way ANOVA test by time. Data are representative of two to three independent experiments and presented as the mean \u00b1 SD in A and B. **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001; n.s., not significant. 0.05 mg/mL. In contrast, the majority of the T98M nsp15 protein is detected in the monomeric form under these conditions, suggesting that the T98M mutation impairs nsp15 oligomerization (Fig. S5) . Thus, our in vitro characterization data for WT and T98M nsp15 proteins strongly support our prediction that the T98M mutation decreases protein stability. We reasoned that the instability of nsp15 imposed by the T98M mutation might impact endoribonuclease activity, which may in turn contribute to the N15m1 phenotype during infection. Indeed, the T98M mutant exhibited significantly reduced RNA cleavage activity in vitro compared with WT protein (Fig. 5D) . Altogether, these results demonstrate that the T98M mutation, like H262A, impairs nsp15 endoribonuclease function, albeit by different means.",

To address this possibility, we measured the abundance of dsRNA during infection of BMDMs by flow cytometry. We predicted that the loss of nsp15 endoribonuclease activity in the mutant viruses would correspond to an increase in immunofluorescence intensity of dsRNA. However, we did not observe a significant difference between WT-and N15m3-infected cells in either B6 or ifnar \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs at early or late phases of infection (Fig. S6 A-C) , implying that nsp15 does not reduce the amount of dsRNA in infected cells.",

Additionally, our group and others have shown that nsp15 also associates with replication complexes (44, 45) and interacts with single-strand RNA and dsRNA (13) . Therefore, we hypothesized that that nsp15 may function to maintain the asso-ciation of dsRNA with replication complexes. We predicted that loss of nsp15 endoribonuclease activity may allow for accumulation of dsRNA that is not associated with replication complexes (\"free\" dsRNA). Such free dsRNA might be vulnerable to detection by cytoplasmic dsRNA sensors. To test this hypothesis, we used ifnar \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs because we showed that replication of both WT and nsp15 mutant viruses is equivalent in these cells. The subcellular localization of dsRNA and nsp2/3, which are hallmark components of viral replication complexes (8) , was detected using confocal microscopy with specific antibodies. Interestingly, N15m3 infection yielded more dsRNA foci that did not colocalize with nsp2/3 foci (Fig. 6A) . To quantify these free dsRNA foci, we used an automated immunofluorescence analysis program (IMARIS) to identify and count the number of dsRNA and nsp2/3 foci. We found that there were similar levels of nsp2/3 + replication complexes in N15m3-and WT-infected cells at 6 hpi; however, more free-dsRNA foci were detected in N15m3-infected cells than in WT-infected cells (Fig. 6A) . Consistent with previous reports (43, 46) , dsRNA was dispersed late in infection, leading to a similar increase in the number of free-dsRNA foci in both WT-and N15m3-infected cells (Fig. S6D) . We note that the early dispersal pattern of dsRNA in N15m3-infected cells coincides with the early activation of dsRNA sensors and the IFN response (Figs. 2-4) . Taken together, these data suggest that nsp15 may not affect the abundance of cytosolic dsRNA, but rather functions to maintain the association of dsRNA with replication complexes, likely by sequestering dsRNA within DMVs (8). To further elucidate the relationship between nsp15 and dsRNA during viral infection, we visualized nsp15 and dsRNA localization by immunofluorescence using specific antibodies. As expected, we found that the number of dsRNA foci that colocalized with nsp15 foci was significantly reduced in N15m3infected cells compared with WT-infected cells (Fig. 6B) . These results demonstrate that nsp15 localization with dsRNAand therefore with replication complexes-is dependent on endoribonuclease activity, the lack of which may result in more free cytoplasmic dsRNA available for detection by host sensors.",

Because the nsp15 mutant viruses are highly attenuated for virulence in vivo, we wanted to determine if these viruses could elicit protective immunity against subsequent challenge with WT virus. B6 mice were infected intraperitoneally with 6 \u00d7 10 4 pfu of nsp15 mutant viruses. Four weeks later, the same mice, as well as na\u00efve, age-matched mice, were challenged with 6 \u00d7 10 4 pfu of WT virus and viral burden and liver pathology were assessed at 5 dpi. In contrast to na\u00efve mice, mice that had been inoculated with nsp15 mutant viruses before challenge with MHV-WT produced undetectable viral titers in tested organs (Fig. 8A ) and no liver pathology observed (Fig. 8B) . Even more striking were the results from intracranial infection. Here we challenged mice that had been previously inoculated 7 wk prior with N15m1 or na\u00efve mice with a 10-fold lethal dose of MHV-WT. We found that the immunized mice experienced only minor weight loss and fully recovered from infection, whereas the age-matched na\u00efve mice succumbed to infection (Fig. 8 C and D) . This finding demonstrates that immunization with nsp15 mutant virus protects mice from a subsequent lethal challenge, suggesting that nsp15 mutant viruses can elicit strong, protective immune memory in mice, which highlights their potential as vaccine candidates.",

Activation of RLRs stimulates the production of type I IFN, which up-regulates additional dsRNA sensors, including PKR and the OAS/RNase L system. Collectively, activation of these systems promotes the expression of ISGs and the subsequent execution of an antiviral state within the cell. Importantly, expression of these dsRNA sensors is maintained at a relatively high basal level in macrophages and microglia, which allows for an immediate response against invading viral pathogens (49) . To counteract these systems, many viruses have evolved strategies to prevent the early activation of dsRNA sensors. Here we describe a previously unrecognized role for coronavirus nsp15 in derailing the activation of dsRNA sensors in macrophages.",

However, as shown here, only by studying nsp15 in the context of viral replication in macrophages and in mice was the nature of the IFN antagonism revealed. We generated murine coronaviruses that encode mutations in nsp15 and compared the replication of WT and mutant viruses in multiple cell types. We found that replication of the mutant viruses was impaired in B6 BMDMs and activated MDA5, PKR, and the OAS/RNase L system. Activation of these dsRNA sensors stimulated IFN and promoted early apoptosis of macrophages, which limited the production of progeny virus in cell culture. In mice, we found that nsp15 mutant viruses were highly attenuated and able to elicit a protective immune response against subsequent challenge with WT virus. Overall, these results reveal a critical function of nsp15 in blocking the activation of host dsRNA sensors, such that disabling nsp15 stability or activity remarkably attenuates coronavirus pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that coronaviruses encode multiple proteins that antagonize recognition of viral dsRNA and prevent activation of the host innate immune response. One such antagonist, coronavirus nsp16, is a 2\u2032O-methyltransferase (2\u2032O-MTase) that provides a cap structure at the 5\u2032-end of viral mRNAs to prevent their detection by host sensor MDA5 (51) . SARS-CoV and MHV mutant viruses that lack 2\u2032O-MTase activity activate the type I IFN response and are attenuated in macrophages and mice (51, 52) . Many additional viral antagonists have been described, and an emerging theme is that these viral proteins may have tissue-or cell type-specific roles. For example, the strain of murine coronavirus used in this study also encodes accessary protein ns2. This protein is a 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiesterase (PDE) that cleaves 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate, the product of OAS. Cleavage of 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate prevents RNase L-mediated degradation of RNA (39) . Loss of ns2 PDE activity attenuates viral pathogenicity in the liver but not in the brain, suggesting a liver-specific effect of ns2 activity (53, 54) . In contrast, our results demonstrate that mutation of nsp15 is sufficient to attenuate viral pathogenesis in both the liver and the brain. Furthermore, we detected activation of the OAS/RNase L pathway in nsp15 mutant virus-infected cells despite the presence of functional ns2 (Fig. 4C) . We speculate, therefore, that there may be a hierarchy of coronaviral proteins that modulate host innate immune responses. Evidence for such a hierarchy was recently reported in the context of MERS-CoV (55) (56) (57) (58) . These studies revealed that MERS-CoV NS4a and NS4b inhibit dsRNA sensors. Specifically, MERS-CoV NS4a encodes a dsRNA-binding protein that limits the activation of PKR, whereas NS4b encodes a PDE, which inhibits RNase L activity similar to MHV ns2. However, Rabouw et al. reported that deletion of NS4a alone did not activate PKR, suggesting that MERS-CoV encodes redundant mechanisms to suppress recognition by, and activation of, dsRNA sensors (57) . To that end, we posit that nsp15 may play a dominant role over ns2/NS4a/Ns4b activity in antagonizing host dsRNA sensors, such that loss of ns2, NS4a, or NS4b alone is not sufficient to activate these sensors in all cell types. Future studies are needed to elucidate the hierarchy of coronavirus proteins, including nsp15, ns2, NS4a, NS4b, the recently described antagonism of nsp14 (43) , and others (6), that collectively antagonize innate immunity and contribute to tissuespecific viral pathogenesis.",

Previously, pestivirus and Lassa virus were shown to encode viral ribonucleases that prevent activation of host sensors by degrading viral dsRNA (59, 60) . Given these examples, it seemed logical to evaluate the relative abundance of viral dsRNA in WTand nsp15 mutant-infected cells ( Fig. 6 and Fig. S6 ). Indeed, while this manuscript was under review, Kindler et al. reported increased accumulation of viral dsRNA in nsp15 mutant virusinfected cells and suggested that nsp15 may be part of a viral RNA decay pathway (61) . However, our analysis indicates no difference in the accumulation of dsRNA in cells infected with viruses that express either functional or catalytically-inactive nsp15. We note that the nsp15 catalytic mutant virus reported here (N15m3) encodes a different mutation (H262A) than the virus reported by Kindler et al. (H277A) (61) , which may account for the difference in results. Another possibility is that nsp15 may recognize and cleave specific dsRNA targets and that mutations in nsp15 may influence target selection. Bhardwaj et al. found that SARS-CoV nsp15 can bind to a highly conserved, hairpinstructured RNA molecule derived from the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the viral genome (13) . This dsRNA-like molecule contains a right-angle turn and a loop with multiple potential cleavage sites. The authors reported that only the site in the right-angle turn could be cleaved, indicating that nsp15 cleavage can be influenced by RNA structure, although it is important to note that these studies were performed in vitro using nonphysiologically relevant manganese concentrations. Future studies are therefore needed to evaluate nsp15-mediated dsRNA cleavage in the context of virus infection.",

Differentiated BMDMs were maintained in bone marrow macrophage media containing DMEM (#10-017-CV, Corning) supplemented with 30% L929 cell supernatant, 20% FCS, 1% L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin/ streptomycin. WT MHV strain A59 (GenBank accession no. AY910861) was generated by reverse genetics and full-genome-sequenced. Rabbit anti-nsp2/3 serum (anti-D3) and anti-nsp15 serum (anti-D23) were previously reported by our laboratory (8, 44) . Mouse anti-N (J3.3) was a gift from John Fleming (University of Wisconsin-Madison, WI).

Subsequent generation of virus by reverse genetics was performed as previously described by Yount et al. (24) . Viral genomic RNA from in vitro transcription (mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit; AM1344, Invitrogen Ambion) of ligated cDNA fragments was electroporated into BHK-R cells. Cell supernatant was collected as viral stock following observation of cytopathic effects. Infectious clones were plaque-purified, propagated on BHK-R cells, and titrated on 17Cl-1 cells. Mutant viruses were maintained exclusively in BHK-R cells, which do not produce or respond to IFN. All virus stock preparations and plaque-purified isolates used in this study were full-genome deep-sequenced (Kansas State University diagnostic laboratory). Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from virus stock using QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (57704, Qiagen), used to generate a cDNA Library and sequenced by Miseq or Ion Torrent technology. Mutant MHV sequences were aligned to the WT MHV-A59 synthetic construct (GenBank accession no. AY910861).",
