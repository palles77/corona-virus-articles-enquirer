Tonsillar swabs and serum were obtained from dogs on entry into the kennels and in regular intervals thereafter. Additional samples were collected during outbreaks of CIRD. The swabs were examined by virus culture and PCR for canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus, canine herpesvirus (CHV) and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV). Furthermore the prevalence of antibodies to CHV and CRCoV was determined. During this study CIRD was reported mainly in one of the two kennels investigated. In that kennel antibody responses to CRCoV indicated a seasonal occurrence of the virus, which coincided with two outbreaks of respiratory disease. CHV antibody responses were detected throughout the year. In the other kennel, which reported few cases of CIRD a high prevalence of antibodies to CRCoV was detected on entry but only sporadic seroconversions to CRCoV or CHV. By PCR three dogs were found positive for CRCoV in one kennel whereas all PCR tests for other viruses were negative for both kennels. Virus culture failed to detect any viruses in either kennel. 1494 K. Erles and J. Brownlie",

            "text": "Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) or \"kennel cough\" is a disease complex, which occurs frequently in densely housed dog populations especially after new dogs have been introduced. [1] . The problem is well known in rehoming and boarding kennels however it is also an important disease of working dogs because it disrupts their training and can even result in temporary closure of kennels. Many factors contribute to the aetiology of CIRD including viruses and bacteria as well as stress due to mixing and housing in an unfamiliar environment. Vaccines are available for some of the microorganisms involved in the disease such as canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) and the bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica. The vaccines have been shown to prevent disease upon experimental challenge with these agents [13] nevertheless CIRD has been reported in many kennels that are using regular vaccination. This may suggest that other microorganisms are present in this disease complex. Canine herpesvirus (CHV) has been detected in dogs with CIRD [3] the importance of this infection in the pathogenesis of the disease however has not yet been determined. In other species such as cats, horses and cattle the involvement of herpesviruses in respiratory disease is well established [11, 18, 19] . CHV has been shown to be able to replicate in the respiratory tract of dogs [2] and has also been detected by PCR in a variety of canine tissue samples [4] . In a study of the English pet dog population by Reading et al. [15] using an ELISA 88% of dogs were found to be positive for CHV IgG. The prevalence of antibodies to CHV in the adult dog population in Belgium was found to be 45.8% [17] and a similar prevalence was detected in The Netherlands (39.3%) [16] . CHV infections therefore appear to be common amongst adult dogs. Whereas Rijsewijk et al. did not find an increase in the number of seropositive dogs after a stay at a boarding kennel, an investigation involving dogs at a rehoming centre in London showed that the percentage of positive dogs increased distinctly amongst dogs that had stayed at the kennel for five weeks or longer [7] . Experimental infection of dogs with CHV has been shown to cause mild clinical symptoms of rhinitis and pharyngitis [2] or to result in \"kennel cough\" [12] .",

At Kennel A two outbreaks of CIRD, which occurred in November 2001 and December 2002 were followed by major increases in the number of seroconversions to CRCoV. Few seroconversions to CRCoV were detected after the CIRD outbreak in October 2001 and none after the small outbreaks from May to July 2002. Similarly infections with coronaviruses in humans have been reported to be seasonal with peaks in late autumn to winter but also in early summer [10, 14] . CRCoV may have contributed to the outbreak of CIRD in November 2001 however almost all dogs present at the kennel at that time seroconverted to CRCoV but not all dogs developed respiratory disease. Other infectious agents are likely to have been present in the dogs that developed CIRD. Infections with CRCoV therefore may not cause any symptoms of clinical respiratory disease. Nevertheless it is possible that the virus may predispose dogs to infections with other viruses or bacteria. Future studies using in situ hybridisation or immunohistochemistry will be necessary to determine if CRCoV is associated with lesions in the respiratory epithelium. Interestingly the percentage of CRCoV antibody positive dogs entering Kennel B was much higher than at Kennel A. All dogs were bred at the same breeding facility and dogs from the same litter did not have the same antibody status indicating that the dogs entering Kennel B became infected with CRCoV after leaving the breeding centre. Dogs from the same area may have come into contact before entering the training kennel as they attended local puppy classes and CRCoV may well have been spread amongst these dogs at such occasions. However no records are available to determine which of the dogs attended these classes. The virus seems to have been rarely present at Kennel B itself as only one of the negative dogs there became positive for CRCoV antibodies during its stay.",

The dogs from Kennel B that were tested had been positive upon arrival at the kennel and had potentially encountered the virus repeatedly during their first year of life. In the majority of dogs from both kennels the antibody titres declined at least two fold in less than a year and two dogs became negative three months after seroconversion.

It is therefore possible that the detection of CRCoV by PCR failed due to an insufficient number of infected cells obtained by tonsillar swabs. The PCR primers were designed towards conserved regions of the spike genes of bovine coronavirus and human coronavirus OC43 strains. Nevertheless these primers may have failed to detect variant strains of CRCoV. In addition CRCoV has proven to be difficult to isolate (unpublished results).

The constant presence of CHV at Kennel A could be due to long periods of viral shedding after infection or due to recurrent introduction of the virus by acutely infected dogs entering the kennel. Dogs suffering from CIRD showed a subsequent seroconversion to CHV more frequently although the difference was not statistically significant. CHV may be able to cause or aggravate the disease but not all dogs with CIRD showed evidence of CHV infection whereas some healthy dogs seroconverted. Moreover CHV can establish latent infections that may have been reactivated by stress or by respiratory disease caused by other microorganisms. This could also explain why seroconversions to CHV were rare at Kennel B where the prevalence of CIRD was very low. CHV was not detected by PCR or virus culture despite studies showing that CHV is present in the tonsils of infected dogs [4] . In a recent study we were able to detect CHV by PCR and culture in tracheal samples from kennelled dogs [7] .As mentioned earlier the amount of cells obtained in the present study may not have been sufficient. This also means that the failure to detect canine parainfluenza virus and canine adenovirus by PCR does not rule out their presence in dogs in this investigation. However all dogs were vaccinated regularly against these viruses. Only dogs housed at Kennel B were vaccinated against Bordetella bronchiseptica, which may have been in part responsible for the rare occurrence of CIRD at this kennel at the time of the study. However no conclusions can be drawn from this study on the efficacy of the vaccination program as this would have required groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs to have been present at both kennels.",

As shown in Fig. 1, seroconversions to CRCoV occurred from November 2001 to February 2002 leading to an increase of the percentage of CRCoV antibody positive dogs to a maximum of 83 percent in December 2001. The subsequent drop in the percentage of positive dogs was due to CRCoV antibody positive dogs leaving the study. Samples collected in December 2002 and January 2003 showed that eight dogs seroconverted to CRCoV in January 2003. At Kennel B, 32 out of 59 dogs (54.2%) were positive for antibodies to CRCoV on the day they entered the kennel.Table 1shows the distribution of antibody positive dogs on the day of arrival from July 2001 to July 2002.
