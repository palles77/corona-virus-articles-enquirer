This is achieved through the theory of opportunity cost which aims at not wasting resources in order to allocate these resources to meet other socioeconomic needs. The investigation, therefore, of the nosology and epidemiology spectrum and population and demographic data highlights and continuously reflects on the type and quantity of goods and health services that must be produced. Many times, however, despite the scientific approach of this investigation, the market of health-care, but also the failures of planning and health system development, produce either services, such as medical services, far in excess of what is necessary, or pharmaceutical products or diagnostic centers or private clinics, creating strong induced demand and imbalance in demand and supply of the health-care market. In any case, if we do not investigate systematically the size and age structure of the population, its regional distribution, and especially the types of diseases and causes of death, the prevalence and incidence of disease, it is not possible to specify the necessary actions of health policies on a preventive and therapeutic level.",

The EU takes under serious consideration the transmission of genetic diseases mostly originated from reproductive cells and for this reason has made adjustments to the European Directives for tissues and cells which vary from the general principles referred to in Directive 2004/23/EC for the setting of quality and safety standards for donation, procurement, control, processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human tissues and cells to the Directives 2006/17/EC and 2006/86/EC which contain detailed technical requirements on processes of standardization and traceability, which means the list of procedures performed in order to prevent serious adverse events (SAE) and SAR.

It also urges the States to develop programs which will encourage the general population and especially some specific groups (minorities) to donate cord blood, since it is proved that the cells can be used for the treatment of diseases like childhood diseases, in order to deal with the problem of lack of compatible donors.",

Because it is necessary to create an integrated policy to raise public awareness, the EU stresses the importance of donating cord blood to cord banks which meet the strict requirements and also emphasizes the fact that public awareness and public opinion play a very important role on the increase of hematopoietic cell donation figures. In this framework, it is necessary to develop a specialized action plan concerning cord blood donation and specifically how to inform the public and future parents in cooperation with CA at a local community level (public health organizations, primary healthcare units, etc.). 32 Moreover, the EU estimates that donations of allogeneic character should be promoted apart from the members of the family, regardless of whether the CBB is public or private, in a way that stored units are available to Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide and thus to every hematological patient who needs transplantation. For this reason it is expected that Member States will establish at least one public CBB. For the achievement of the main goal, which is the safeguard and the availability of cord blood units, each EU Member State is invited to establish a regional network of maternity hospitals which will have the authorization to receive samples in order to supply all population centers.",

After conducting a comprehensive strategic social marketing plan, these organizations can be the core through which cord blood units can be collected, and therefore a representative sample of the most frequent or rare HLA haplotypes of the population can be formed. Finally, it is understandable that in this procedure there are evaluation stages of the actions taken and also strategy redefinition when required, in order to form an applicable, gradually developing, flexible, and efficient plan of investigating the Member States' registries.",

PYLLs from all causes for ages 0-69 years per 100,000 people show significant decreasing trends for both women and men during the period 1961-2010. In women, the greatest reductions are noted in Spain at 78% (from 8238 in 1961 to 1787 in 2010) and Greece at 73% (from 7576 in 1961 to 2036 in 2010). For men, the percentages of reduction are 68% in Spain and 57% in Greece. Therefore, both the falling rate of the indicator and the sharp differences between the sexes can be clearly seen.In the United States, the corresponding rate of decline of PYLLs during the same period was 53% for women and men equally. In Japan, for women it was 79.9% and for men 76.5%. In 1961, the years of life lost for women was at 8004 years for the OECD countries, and in 2010 only 2457 years, respectively.
