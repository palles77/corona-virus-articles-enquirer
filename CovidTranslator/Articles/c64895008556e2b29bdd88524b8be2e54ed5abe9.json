During the 1980s, French groups investigated the etiology of the disease. Because propagation on cells or embryos remained unsuccessful and molecular tools were unavailable, etiologic hypotheses were based mostly on electron microscopy findings. The groups reached different conclusions, proposing candidates such as toga-like virus (1), reovirus, or herpesvirus (2) . More recently, astroviruses have been associated with catarrhal enteritis in guinea poults (i.e., young guinea fowl) (3), but these viruses were not detected in birds affected by fulminating disease (data not shown).",

From each affected flock, 5-10 sick birds were euthanized, and necropsy was performed. Most birds showed marked congestive enteritis and a whitish, enlarged pancreas.

A third group of 5 uninoculated birds were placed in the other isolator. Inoculated and contact birds showed severe prostration as early as 2 days after infection and died or had to be euthanized within 6 days. Uninoculated birds showed no clinical signs of illness throughout the experiment.

The pellets were treated with RNase (Ambion, 20 \u00b5g/mL) and DNase (Invitrogen, 10 U/\u00b5L) (both from Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) to concentrate the viral material. RNA and DNA were extracted separately, and a random reverse transcription PCR was performed, as described (6), to generate unbiased PCR products of \u2248300 bp. High-throughput sequencing was performed by using a MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). A total of 476,430 sequences were generated (Table 1) , 10 .8% of which matched with known viral sequences, as determined by using GAAS software (http://gaas.sourceforge.net/) (7) with an expected value of 10 -3 ; 7.5% of the eukaryotic viral reads were similar to avian CoVs, such as turkey CoV (TCoV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). A total of 1,444 reads related to CoVs were aligned against the most similar TCoV genome available in GenBank (TCoV/CA/MG10; accession no. EU095850). The reads fairly aligned to almost the whole TCoV genome; the overall coverage was 78.86% (data not shown). A CoV-specific reverse transcription PCR was performed and the result was positive, specifically in intestinal tissues of experimentally infected birds ( Table  2 ) (8). Furthermore, immunochemistry was performed by using a monoclonal antibody specific for TCoVs (9) . We observed an intense, cytoplasmic, and granular labeling in enterocyte villi of inoculated birds only (Figure 1) , suggesting a substantial intestinal replication of a TCoV-related virus. A 3,680-nt consensus full sequence of the spike (S) gene was completed by classical PCR and Sanger sequencing (GenBank/EMBL accession no. HF544506). A BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) search followed by a phylogenetic analysis performed on the complete S gene showed that guinea fowl fulminating enteritis virus corresponds to a distinct genotype of CoV, clustering within Gammacoronavirus genus, which also includes TCoV and IBV (10) . The complete S gene sequence of guinea fowl CoV (GFCoV) was most similar to that of the TCoV S gene (minimum Kimura distance 22.6% at the nucleotide level between GFCoV/FR/2011 and TCoV/VA/74/2004, TCoV/CA/MG10, TCoV/IN/517/1994, or TCoV/ATCC). The GFCoV S gene was more similar to those of North American TCoV than to those of European (French) TCoV strains ( Figure 2 ) (11) .",

IBV and TCoV share <36% similarity for the S gene, but their full genomes are >86% similar (14) . Although the origin of GFCoV is still unknown, the distance of its S gene to TCoV and IBV S genes suggests not only a common ancestor but also a current separate evolutionary path. A quail CoV similar to TCoV has been described (15); its available S gene sequence also clusters with North American TCoV ( Figure 2 ). However, the comparable partial S gene sequences of quail CoV/Italy/Elvia/2005 and GFCoV differ greatly (genetic distance 30%). A few cases of guinea fowl fulminating disease are diagnosed each year in France but have no apparent epidemiologic link to each other. The severity of the disease in the field may suggest a poor adaptation of the pathogen to guinea fowl. This pathologic pattern differs greatly from TCoV enteritis in turkeys and makes GFCoV of potential interest for comparative studies of CoV pathobiology. Virus reemergence may indicate that >1 other species may also be asymptomatic carriers.",
