            "text": "Seasonal influenza A generally causes a yearly epidemic with variable prevalence based on vaccine efficacy and antigenic drift. Antigenic drift occurs in seasonal influenza due to minor mutations in the viral hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. Antigenic shift occurs because of the ability of the virus to infect multiple animals, especially birds, and the ability of the segmented genome to undergo reassortment, mixing different proteins from different viral strains (Table 1) . Novel influenza strains are antigenically distinct because of complete exchange of gene segments encoding the H or NA proteins, introducing H and NA variants that have not previously circulated in humans; thus, reassortant viruses have the ability to cause pandemics because of minimal preexisting population immunity. Avian influenza viruses can be passed to humans directly through close contact, or indirectly through another animal host. Because these viruses are adapted to birds, they usually have limited ability to replicate in humans, restricting person-to-person transmission. However, this can be circumvented by either mutation or reassortment with a human virus, as in the pandemic 2009 H1N1, which was a reassortment between avian, human, and swine influenza viruses. 1,2 Initially, reports of novel influenza A viruses centered on cases of H5N1. H5N1 human cases have occurred predominantly in Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and the Middle East; however, H5N1 has been detected in birds across Eurasia, Indonesia, and North Africa. Newly emerging avian influenza strains, including H7N9 and H10N8, have been identified in patients with poultry exposure in China. Seasonal outbreaks of H7N9 in humans have occurred since 2013, with a recent spike in cases in China. 3 Most cases have been reported in adults. 4 Influenza A H5N1 causes more severe disease and higher mortality in children, whereas personto-person transmission is more common with H7N9, with nearly half of pediatric cases occurring in secondary clusters. 5 These novel influenza strains retain their preference for avian receptors and are not well adapted for human-to-human transmission. 6 Thus, pediatric cases are less common, likely because of lower rates of poultry exposure in children. Nonetheless, these viruses have been adapted in a controlled setting to be transmissible among mammals 7 ; therefore, sustained human-to-human transmission could be possible, placing children at risk.",

CoVs can infect multiple species, and crossover from animals to humans can lead to outbreaks. 1 Epidemic CoVs have been reported, most notably severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003. 36 In 2012, a 60-year-old Saudi Arabian presented with pneumonia and respiratory failure. A novel Betacoronavirus, subsequently termed Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), was identified. Although most of the cases were detected in Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, imported cases to the United States were described. 37 The virus was closely related to bat CoVs. 38 However, camels were later identified as an intermediary host when zoonotic transmissions occurred, 39 and MERS-CoV seroprevalence was significantly higher among persons with camel exposure. 40 Person-to-person transmission did occur, which led to secondary hospital outbreaks. 41 Although initial reports primarily occurred in adults, likely related to zoonotic and occupational exposures, pediatric cases developed in household contacts. 42 ",

Although initial case fatality rates exceeded 50%, 44 a large number (25%) of patients with laboratory-confirmed infection were asymptomatic in other studies. 43 Data are sparse in children. In one case series of 11 Saudi children with confirmed MERS-CoV, the median age was 13 years (range 2-16 years), older than most respiratory viruses. Only 2 patients had symptoms, and both had underlying medical diseases, a 2-year-old with cystic fibrosis and a 14-year-old with Down syndrome and cardiopulmonary disease. Although the younger child died of respiratory failure, the older child had a relatively uncomplicated hospital course. Pulmonary imaging for both children demonstrated bilateral diffuse infiltrates. 45 In one cohort of household contacts of MERS-CoV-infected subjects, the secondary attack rate was relatively low at 5%. The virus did not have an increased predilection for children, and none of the infected children developed symptoms, suggesting that disease may be worse with primary transmission and/or in adults. 42",

Broad range PCR allows for detection of a variety of RVs by using primers targeting a conserved region. A subsequent step, including seminested PCR or sequencing, can identify the specific species and serotype.
