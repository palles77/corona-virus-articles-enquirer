Non-viral gene delivery systems are a diverse collection of technologies that are applicable to both of these forms of RNAi. Importantly, unlike antisense and ribozyme systems, a remarkable trait of siRNA is a lack of dependence on chemical modifications blocking enzymatic degradation, although chemical protection methods developed for the earlier systems are being incorporated into siRNA and are generally compatible with non-viral delivery systems. The use of siRNA is emerging more rapidly than for shRNA, in part due to the increased effort required to construct shRNA expression systems before selection of active sequences and verification of biological activity are obtained. In contrast, screens of many siRNA sequences can be accomplished rapidly using synthetic oligos. It is not surprising that the use of siRNA in vivo is also emerging first. Initial in vivo studies have been reported for both viral and non-viral delivery but viral delivery is limited to shRNA. This review describes the emerging in vivo application of non-viral delivery systems for RNAi for functional genomics, which will provide a foundation for further development of RNAi therapeutics. Of interest is the rapid adaptation of ligand-targeted plasmid-based nanoparticles for RNAi agents. These systems are growing in capabilities and beginning to pose a serious rival to viral vector based gene delivery. The activity of siRNA in the cytoplasm may lower the hurdle and thereby accelerate the successful development of therapeutics based on targeted non-viral delivery systems. \u00df 2005, Elsevier Inc.",

RNA interference (RNAi): strong and selective gene inhibition RNA interference has rapidly displaced antisense and ribozymes as the preferred means for sequence-specific gene inhibition in cell culture studies (Bantounas et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2003; McManus and Sharp, 2002 ) . Along with rapid adoption as a tool for functional genomics, expanding studies on RNAi itself have greatly enhanced our understanding of this endogenous gene inhibition process since discovery that posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants is also active in animal cells. Despite rapidly expanding studies, RNAi biology is still far from being well understood. A major challenge is the growing appreciation that the RNAi system is involved in several endogenous activities with differing roles. One of the earliest recognized roles of RNAi is as an antiviral response triggered by the double-stranded (ds) RNA genome of the double-stranded RNA virus. For such a response to be effective, strong and selective gene inhibition is important. This gene inhibition function operates through an active intermediate that is short fragments of the dsRNA genome, now called short interfering RNA (siRNA), as shown in Fig. 6 .1. The RNAi antiviral response generally is accompanied by interferon and other events induced by recognition of the dsRNA viral genome. An important finding has been that introduction of siRNA with sequences matching endogenous genes, instead of invading virus genomes, leads to activation of the RNAi system and inhibition of that endogenous gene. Importantly, studies have shown that introduction of these artificial siRNA usually avoids the interferon and other concomitant biological responses (McManus and Sharp, 2002) . Also, the RNAi machinery has been found to perform its function in the cytoplasmic compartment, reducing the hurdles for intracellular siRNA delivery compared to gene therapy requirements for delivery to the nucleus.",

The palindrome sequence forms an imperfect dsRNA segment with a loop of single-stranded (ss) RNA at one end, or a hairpin type of structure, mimicked by expressed short hairpin RNA (shRNA). This RNAi role regulating endogenous gene expression may help explain why the introduction of siRNA matching endogenous genes shows strong and selective inhibition of matching endogenous genes. Thus while the specific role of RNAi can vary considerably, the fundamental activity of RNAi is blocking expression of specific genes. Consequently, it is not surprising that different RNAi processes have very similar mechanisms of action and share machinery. The shared machinery may aid efforts to harness RNAi for our own purposes by allowing greater utility of the techniques developed. However, with versatility comes complexity and increased risk of inducing unwanted or unexpected RNAi activities. Ultimately, though, what makes the RNAi system so attractive is its fundamental capabilities to achieve very strong inhibition of specific genes, and with striking selectivity. This is clearly essential for biological systems to regulate themselves. It is also the goal of targeted therapeutic strategies, driven by realization that the most successful drugs act through inhibition of specific target proteins. A number of studies have evaluated the extent of gene inhibition specificity achieved with siRNA, in most cases indicating selectivity but not an absolute selectivity ( Chi et al., 2003; Jackson et al ., 2003; Kariko et al., 2004; Semizarov et al., 2003; Sledz et al., 2003 ) . In fact, it can be difficult to distinguish between an off-target effect on the wrong gene and downstream biological consequences from RNAi silenced genes. An important aspect that has yet to be addressed is the relative selectivity by siRNA versus other gene sequence-based methods for inhibiting gene expression, i.e., antisense. Nonetheless, while off-target effects have been observed, the most common outcome is a finding of substantial siRNA gene selectivity. Thus the use of appropriate controls is important.",

This feature has fueled a rapid adoption of RNAi for biology research through the design of siRNA with a sequence matching genes of interest. The siRNA oligonucleotides were originally identified as short dsRNA fragments generated by RNAi machinery called Dicer that processes long dsRNA, such as from a viral infection, into siRNA fragments. These siRNA were found to be an active intermediate used a second piece of the machinery, called RISC, to select mRNA for degradation, as described elsewhere ( Bantounas et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2003; McManus and Sharp, 2002 ) . The mechanism for miRNA appears to be similar but not identical to that of siRNA. One similarity is that the miRNA also appear to invoke some of the same RISC components and degrade the homologous mRNA before ribosomal translation can occur. The endogenous activity of RNAi to regulate endogenous gene expression, which clearly depends on both good specificity and strong inhibition, may explain its robust potency and selectivity. But while the nature of RNAi remains an area of active investigation, the use of short dsRNA sequences is proving to be an extremely robust and effective method to inhibit specific genes of interest, simply, and depending largely on the identification of unique sequences for that gene or splice variant (Fig. 6.1) .",

The latter has led to considerable adoption of siRNA for functional genomics looking for inhibition of genes that can generate therapeutic benefits reversing pathological effects, often caused by overexpression of those same genes.

The artificial siRNA is taken up by the RISC machinery and used to block the expression of endogenous mRNA containing a matching sequence. This approach remains the most prominent method for high-throughput RNAi research, as short oligonucleotide synthesis can be fast and performed in high throughput.

An initial challenge for this approach was the difficulty of getting expression of two short complementary RNA oligonucleotides within the cell to result in their hybridization to yield the dsRNA oligonucleotide. One solution to this problem is expressing a single RNA with a palindromic sequence so that it can hybridize with itself and form a stem-loop \"hairpin\" structure much like miRNA, now called short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Theoretically, such expression cassettes can be introduced by any of the standard gene delivery systems, including viral and non-viral methods. A growing number of efforts are being reported for the construction of such systems and evaluation for in vivo application (Davidson and Paulson, 2004; Devroe and Silver, 2002; Kobayashi et al. , 2004; Pardridge, 2004; Tiscornia et al. , 2003; Xia et al. , 2002) However, the time and effort needed to construct such expression cassettes and incorporate them into delivery systems add considerably to the time and cost to set up a study for a gene of interest. This is particularly true when it is realized that several sequences must be tested to find 6 . In Vivo Application of RNA Interference an effective sequence. Unfortunately, identification of active sequences using synthetic siRNA oligonucleotides is not always predictive of active shRNA sequences, reducing the utility of preliminary siRNA screens to address this problem.

As found in gene therapy efforts, development of non-viral delivery methods that achieve tumor-targeted siRNA delivery and activity from an intravenous administration has proven to be difficult. One study reported use of a cationic chemical derivative of cardiolipin to form lipoplexes with siRNA targeting the cRAF (also known as RAF-1) oncogene that inhibited tumor growth in a sequence-specific manner but the study neglected to evaluate whether the target gene was specifically inhibited ( Chien et al., 2004 ) .

The efficiency of plasmid expression is also limited, as trafficking to the nucleus is thought to be inadequate. For siRNA, its activity in the cytoplasm reduces the challenge. Results have been published using systemic administration of a targeted nanoplex using an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif peptide ligand that combines selective localization at neovasculature with delivery of siRNA inhibiting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway gene expression driving angiogenesis whether in tumors or eye disease ( Kim et al., 2004; Schiffelers et al., 2004b) .

The rapid extension of siRNA functional genomics studies in vitro, now very well accepted, to studies in preclinical human xenograft tumor models (Ding et al. , 2004) , also well accepted as a key stepping stone to clinical investigation, is limited only by a lack of good local tumor delivery. Unfortunately, like earlier gene therapy studies, local delivery of siRNA into tumors is not efficient with either aqueous solutions (so-called \"naked\" nucleic acid) or standard transfection reagents, including the best cationic lipids and polymers. In fact, local administration of aqueous siRNA into tumors was found less effective than a distal systemic administration on an endogenous reporter gene (Filleur et al., 2003) . In that study, effects observed from distal administration were not attributable to an RNAi activity and the authors concluded that tumor delivery was inadequate. Some work has begun to emerge for the local tumor delivery of siRNA, showing sufficient gene inhibition for target validation (Lu et al., 2002; Minakuchi et al. , 2004) .",

Thus the key to using siRNA sequences directed to any gene target implicated in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases is effective local delivery enabling intracellular delivery of siRNA agents at the diseased site and, more specifically, the specific cellular components of the disease pathology (Rutz and Scheffold, 2004) . Direct injection of siRNA molecules has been reported by hydrodynamic pressure in isolated limbs (Hagstrom et al., 2004) or formulated with cationic lipids or polymers can be considered for local delivery, but tend to induce inflammation, which is contraindicated for arthritic disease studies. Also, for plasmid delivery to skeletal muscle, eletroporation has proven the most robust method and recently applied to siRNA delivery, (Golzio et al. , 2004) . The extension of this method to inflamed joints in an arthritis model has shown promise as a method for functional genomic studies (Schiffelers et al. , 2005) , but clinical application of this approach has yet to be described. Ultimately, the biology of the inflammation and immune response, which is central to the rheumatic arthritic diseases, may benefit from cell targeting. To that end, the use of ligand-targeted nanoparticles, even with local intraarticular injection, is attractive as a potential means to achieve gene inhibition without exacerbating the pathological phenotype by the delivery system itself.",

            "text": "Some of the first published results showing activity of siRNA in mammals accomplished that feat by delivery into mouse liver. This was achieved using hydrodynamic delivery, a rapid injection of a large volume of aqueous solution into the mouse tail vein creating high pressure in the vascular circulation that leads to extensive delivery into hepatocytes ( Lewis et al., 2002; McCaffrey et al., 2002; Song et al., 2003; Zender et al., 2003 ) . Studies using hydrodynamic administration also found poor activity of aqueous siRNA when given by traditional intravenous administration, even when chemically stabilized siRNA were used ( Layzer et al., 2004 ) , unlike earlier findings with antisense oligonucleotides. These studies showed that siRNA not only can inhibit exogenous plasmid expression, but also endogenous hepatocyte gene expression. The success implies that delivery of siRNA to the liver results in uptake by a majority of hepatocytes, as found for plasmid delivery. Interestingly, recent studies found that aqueous administration of siRNA didn't induce a non-specific interferon response (Heidel et al., 2004) . The hydrodynamic administration procedure allows the use of siRNA in mice for gene function and drug target validation studies (Sen et al., 2003; Zender et al., 2003) , but is limited largely to research on liver function and metabolism or liver infectious diseases such as hepatitis. Although this particular method is not clinically feasible for human patients, it is an effective approach for gene function validation. Song et al. (2003) injected Fas siRNA and achieved down-regulation of both Fas mRNA and Fas protein in mouse hepatocytes, and the effects persisted without diminution for 10 days. Zender and colleagues (2003) delivered 21 nucleotide siRNAs against caspase 8, resulting in inhibition of caspase 8 gene expression in the liver, thereby preventing Fas (CD95)-mediated apoptosis. Giladi and colleagues (2004) used hydrodynamic delivery of siRNA to inhibit levels of hepatitis B viral transcripts, viral antigens, and viral DNA in liver and sera. Adenovirus has also been applied for liver delivery of expressed RNAi methods but mainly offers an orthogonal delivery approach to confirm that findings are due to gene inhibition and not specific to the delivery method. Although both hydrodynamic delivery and adenoviral vector are not clinically acceptable methods, these two systems have a relatively high hepatocyte efficiency, which is a very powerful tool for hepatocyte functional genomic studies.",

Sorenson et al. (2003) described the use of lipoplex gene delivery systems for the systemic delivery of siRNA, attaining a strong lung delivery as found when plasmid DNA is used. Other work with siRNA lipoplexes formed with a cardiolipid analogue showed phenotypic effects on tumor growth but lack confirmation of an RNAi activity at the tumor and suggest that much of the distribution is to the lung as expected from a lipoplex. An emergence of targeted nanoparticle systems, initially for plasmids or DNA oligonucleotides for cancer, is much more promising (Hood et al., 2002; Pun et al., 2004; Woodle et al., 2001) . The nature of these systems to protect and deliver isolated DNA suggests that they can be adapted for siRNA oligonucleotides. Results support this conclusion using an RGD peptide ligand-directed nanoparticle for antiangiogenic treatment for cancer (Dubey et al., 2004) by systemic siRNA delivery (Schiffelers et al ., 2004b) . These results provide growing support for the development of systemic siRNA treatments for cancer, with a growing proof of concept for antiangiogenic modalities as reviewed elsewhere (Lu et al., 2005) . The RGD ligand-targeted nanoparticle for targeting neovasculature has also been studied in ocular neovascularization models (Kim et al., 2004) . The results further strengthen the support for this approach as a clinically feasible method for siRNA therapeutics. They also provided a demonstration that siRNA for several genes can be combined in the same nanoparticle to give a better inhibition of disease pathology.",

            "text": "In cancer, the tumorigenesis process is thought to be the result of an abnormal overexpression of oncogenes, growth factors, and mutant tumor suppressors, even though underexpression of other proteins also plays critical roles. Efforts to identify and validate tumorigenic targets have been focused mainly on those targets overexpressed in the tumor tissues and promoting tumorigenesis as a means to enable development of small molecule and antibody anticancer drugs acting through an inhibitor mechanism. There are rapidly increasing numbers of reports demonstrating that siRNA and shRNA are able to knockdown tumorigenic genes in vitro , with emerging reports for in vivo ( Lu et al., 2003b; Xie et al ., 2004) . Studies designed to reveal whether a gene target plays a tumorigenic role use siRNA duplexes specifically targeting its mRNA sequence to knock down its expression and then observing whether the effect on pathology is a direct and specific effect. One method has been described for a unique target identification approach (Lu et al., 2003a) named Efficacy-First discovery. This method utilizes efficient nucleic acid delivery into xenograft tumors to induce phenotypic effects on tumor growth rate as a method to verify or validate candidate genes for a controlling role in tumor growth behaviors. Using these methods, a pool of gene targets was identified for changes in expression that correlated with changes in tumor growth rate, i.e., their expression correlated with efficacy. Among the well-known cancer cell growth factors, VEGF and VEGF R2 represent two of the most widely recognized and highly validated targets. In these studies, siRNA-mediated downregulation of these endogenous genes in clinically relevant animal models was used as part of a functional genomics study in cancer ( Lu et al., 2003a) . Marked tumor growth inhibition was observed following repeated delivery of the siRNAs specific to hVEGF and mVEGFR2, which accompanied knockdown of the growth factor at both mRNA and protein levels. The results illustrate the feasibility of using siRNA delivery in animal tumor models for drug target validation according to its ability to achieve efficacy ( Lu et al., 2003a) . This in vivo delivery of siRNA enables differentiation of genes to find out which play a disease-controlling role in tumor growth. This validation process, called disease-control validation, is based on tumor efficacy by siRNA in vivo and with clinically relevant xenograft tumor models to give a clear indication of the importance of specific proteins as a drug target (Lu et al., 2003a) .",

In fact, rapid excretion of siRNA from blood into the urine occurs before degradation. Nonetheless, efforts are underway to increase its biological stability, primarily via medicinal chemistry originally developed for oligonucleotides. However, chemical stabilization does not address key requirements for better pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution. With conjugation of lipophilic residues to increase serum protein binding, improved pharmacokinetics of the oligonucleotide, alteration of its biodistribution, and reduced urinary excretion were observed (Soutschek et al., 2004) . Ultimately, such chemical modification must also address requirements for entering targeted cells, overcoming endosomal and other intracellular barriers, and retaining activity with the cellular RNAi machinery. A different approach to solving these problems using ligand-targeted nanoparticles (Kim et al., 2004; Pardridge, 2004; Schiffelers et al., 2004b) is showing good activity even without chemical stabilization. The fundamental thinking behind this approach is that RNA interference is a natural process involving a complicated 6 . In Vivo Application of RNA Interference cellular mechanism where siRNA is the predominant intermediate playing a sequence-specific silencing function. Therefore, preserving the biochemical authenticity of siRNA and improving its in vivo delivery efficiency with nanoparticle or other formulations will have the best chance for success in therapeutic application, and, importantly, the best chance to reduce unwanted side effects. Although local and topical delivery of siRNA may fit well for certain disease applications, the systemic delivery of siRNA will have much broader therapeutic applications. The ideal system for siRNA systemic delivery should be a nanoparticle with ligand-directed tissue localization (Fig. 6.3) . This threestage system should be able to first protect the siRNA duplex from excretion and degradation in body fluid such as blood and, at the same time, avoid aggregation and nonspecific binding of the nanoparticles. The system should also have targeting capability to reach disease tissue specifically. When the particle binds and enters the targeted cells, the siRNA content should be released for action. When the siRNA specifically inhibits expression of a disease-causing gene and protein, the clinical benefit will be achieved. As described earlier, a layered nanoplex system has been described that combines neovasculature-targeted Figure 6 .3.

As disease mechanisms become increasingly clear, its application can be developed to silence newly identified genes involved in known pathogenic pathways. For example, an obvious siRNA target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the -site APP-cleaving enzyme BACE, which is required for the production of A peptide and is present at elevated levels in the cortex of people with AD.",

            "text": "One of the greatest prospects for therapeutics is the ability to develop therapeutic agents that control multiple targets. This is one aspect of siRNA that offers considerable promise relative to the current set of targeted therapeutics such as antibodies. Considerable evidence shows that many types of human diseases result from overexpression of multiple disease-causing genes. Thus the potent and specific properties of siRNA that are controlled solely by changes to their sequence suggest that their combinations will be easily managed. Kim et al. (2004) showed the facility with which siRNA can provide combination therapeutics (an siRNA oligo cocktail) targeting multiple genes in the pathology to achieve much better therapeutic efficacy. This approach is based on two important facts: although inhibitory siRNA duplexes are sequence specific, all of them use an identical chemistry (dsRNA oligonucleotides); however, many human diseases are the result of overexpression of multiple endogenous and exogenous disease-causing genes. Using an siRNA oligo cocktail targeting multiple diseasecausing genes represents an advantageous therapeutic approach with a synergistic effect. Nevertheless, even as a single agent, siRNA has tremendous therapeutic potential that will be realized when clinically feasible deliveries are developed.",
