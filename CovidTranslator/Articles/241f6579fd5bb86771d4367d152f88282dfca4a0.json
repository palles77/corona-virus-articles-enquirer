            "text": "After intranasal inoculation, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) gains entry into the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. Under the appropriate conditions, some mice develop clinically apparent demyelinating encephalomyelitis several weeks later, with virus always present in the spinal cord. To determine the pathway by which virus reaches the cord, brains and spinal cords of infected, asymptomatic mice were analyzed by in situ hybridization. Viral RNA was always detected in the anterior part of the upper spinal cord. A similar analysis of mice with the recent onset of hindlimb weakness showed that viral RNA was detected in the same location. The results suggest that MHV is transported to the spinal cord via well-defined neuroanatomic pathways and that viral amplification with resultant clinical disease occurs from this site of persistence in the anterior spinal cord. This process of viral amplification may involve the generation of viral variants as has been described for MHV-infected rats. No major changes in viral RNA or protein could be detected when MHV isolated from mice with hindlimb paralysis was analyzed. The data suggest that the generation of viral variants is not important in the pathogenesis of the late onset neurological disease induced by MHG in mice. 0 1990Academic Press, inc.",

Previously, we have described the spread of MHV-JHM through the central nervous system (CNS) of suckling mice nursed by unimmunized and immunized dams (Perlman et a/., 1988 (Perlman et a/., , 1989 . After intranasal inoculation, ' To whom requests for reprints should be addressed. virus enters the brain via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves and spreads along known neuroanatomic pathways. In mice dying from the acute encephalitis, virus is localized in many parts of the brain whereas it remains confined to the sites of entry and their associated structures in asymptomatic mice protected by maternal antibody. The exact localization of MHV-JHM in asymptomatic mice at later times p.i. was not determined in these experiments. In mice which subsequently develop hindlimb paralysis, virus is always present in the spinal cord and less consistently can be detected in specific locations in the brain which are neuroanatomic connections of the initial sites of viral entry. Thus virus can be detected in distant connections of the olfactory nerve such as the hippocampus and mammillary nuclei and in those of the trigeminal nerve such as the caudal thalamus and the cerebral cortex (Perlman et a/., 1988 (Perlman et a/., , 1989 .",

In the spinal cord, virus is localized largely in the ventral (motor, anterior) part and to a lesser extent in the dorsolateral or dorsal (sensory) parts. A likely explanation for the ventral cord localization of virus is that the virus is transported from the trigeminal nerve to the sensory trigeminal nuclei in the brainstem (Fig. 7A ) and from there to the reticular nuclei of the pons and medulla oblongata (Barr and Kiernan, 1988) which are known to project via the reticulospinal tract (Fig. 7B) to the spinal motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The localization of virus in the white matter of the anterior cord corresponds to the anatomic localization of the reticulospinal tract in the spinal cord. An alternative, though less likely route, is via the olfactory-reticular connections. Olfactory stimulation has been shown by physiologic methods to evoke activity in the reticular formation possibly mediated by corticoreticular fibers arising from olfactory areas of the cerebral cortex (Barr and Kiernan, 1988) .",

This model predicts that free virus should be present in the CSF at some time during the course of MHV-JHM infection. Alternatively, since MHV-JHM has been shown to infect rat spinal ganglionic neurons (Sorensen and Dales, 1985) virus could conceivably spread to specific areas of the spinal cord after initial amplification in spinal ganglia. Infection of spinal ganglia may be particularly important in the pathogenesis of CNS infection following intraperitoneal inoculation. Experiments in which specific parts of the trigeminal and olfactory pathways are transected prior to intranasal inoculation should help distinguish between models involving neuroanatomic spread and those involving spread via the CSF or spinal ganglia.",

After reactivation, virus migrates to the temporal lobe, resulting in a severe encephalitis. A similar process may occur in humans who develop HSV encephalitis (Corey and Spear, 1986; Stroop, 1986) . Thus it appears that HSV and MHV establish latency or persistence in the same locations, but that HSV preferentially reactivates from the trigeminal or olfactory systems in the brain, whereas MHV is amplified most commonly from a site of persistence in the spinal cord.",
