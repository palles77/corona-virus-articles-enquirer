            "text": "The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the COVID-19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409e7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128e1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588e13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th e 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.",

Early cases of the disease have been linked to a live animal seafood market in Wuhan, pointing to a zoonotic origin of the epidemic. However, human-to-human transmission has driven its rapid spread with a total of 37,289 confirmed cases, including 813 deaths, in China and 302 confirmed cases imported in multiple countries as of February 9, 2020 (Chinese National Health Committee). While the early transmission potential of this novel coronavirus appeared similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Riou & Althaus, 2020) , the current tally of the epidemic has already surpassed the total cases reported for the SARS outbreaks in 2002e2003 (W.

To anticipate additional resources to combat the epidemic, mathematical and statistical modeling tools can be useful to generate timely short-term forecasts of reported cases. These predictions can include estimates of expected morbidity burden that can help guide public health officials preparing the medical care and other resources needed to confront the epidemic. Short-term forecasts can also guide the intensity and type of interventions needed to mitigate an epidemic (Funk, Camacho, Kucharski, Eggo, & Edmunds, 2016; Shanafelt, Jones, Lima, Perrings, & Chowell, 2017) . In the absence of vaccines or antiviral drugs for 2019-nCoV, the effective implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as personal protection and social distancing, will be critical to bring the epidemic under control.",

The data contains 34 areas, including provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and special administrative regions; here we refer to the regions collectively as provinces. Data updates were collected daily at 12 p.m. , between January 22, 2020 and February 9, 2020. The short time-series is affected by irregularities and reporting lags, so the cumulative curves are more stable and likely yield more stable and reliable estimates. Therefore, we analyze the cumulative trajectory of the epidemic in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, as well as the cumulative aggregate trajectory of all other provinces.",

The generalized logistic growth model (GLM) extends the simple logistic growth model to accommodate sub-exponential growth dynamics with a scaling of growth parameter, p (Viboud, Simonsen, & Chowell, 2016 ). The Richards model also includes a scaling parameter, a, to allow for deviation from the symmetric logistic curve (Chowell, 2017; Richards, 1959; Wang et al., 2012) . We also include a recently developed sub-epidemic wave model that supports complex epidemic trajectories, including multiple peaks (i.e., SARS in Singapore ). In this approach, the observed reported curve is assumed to be the aggregate of multiple underlying sub-epidemics . A detailed description for each of the models is included in the Supplement.",

This can, in part, be attributed to the smaller case counts and smaller initial prediction interval range seen in other provinces. Mean predictions and associated Fig. 3 . Forecasting results for 15-days ahead estimates, generated daily from February 5e9, 2020, of cumulative reported cases in Hubei (a) and other provinces (b). The mean case estimate is represented by the dots, while the lines represent the 95% prediction intervals for each model. uncertainty remain relatively stable in other provinces though, while the mean estimates of 10 and 15 days ahead decrease significantly in Hubei (Figs. 2 and 3 ). This suggests that the epidemic lasts longer in Hubei compared to other provinces (Figs. 4e6), which may be attributed to intensive control efforts and large-scale social distancing interventions. Therefore, it is not necessarily surprising that estimates from earlier dates, specifically prior to saturation, yield predictions with higher uncertainty.",

Importantly, the curves of confirmed cases that we employ in our study are reported according to reporting date and could be influenced by testing capacity and other related factors. Further, there may be significant delays in identifying, isolating, and reporting cases in Hubei due to the magnitude of the epidemic, which could influence our predictions. Incidence curves according to the date of symptom onset could provide a clearer picture of the transmission dynamics during an epidemic. We also note that we analyzed the epidemic curves starting on January 22, 2020, but the epidemic started in December 2019. Hence, the first data point accumulates cases up until January 22, 2020, as data were not available prior to this date.",

Our timely short-term forecasts based on phenomenological models can be useful for real-time preparedness, such as anticipating the required number of hospital beds and other medical resources, as they provide an estimate of the number of cases hospitals will need to prepare for in the coming days. In future work, we plan to report the results of a retrospective analysis of forecasting performance across models based on various performance metrics. Of note, the case definition changed on February 12, 2020 to count clinical cases that have not been laboratory tested. As a result in this change in reporting, the province of Hubei experienced a jump in the nuber of cases on February 13th, 2020. This change in reporting will need to be taken into account in order to assess the accuracy of the forecasts reported here.",
