Current operative strategies include either direct nerve repair, nerve grafting, or direct implantation of a peripheral nerve into a denervated muscle (neurotization), with the expectation that the nerve will grow and reinnervate denervated motor end plates. 1 Each of these strategies has been reported to result in partial clinical restoration of muscle function that correlates inversely with the duration of denervation. Some investigators have theorized that the principal site of failure of reinnervation is the motor end plate. 2, 3 Others have demonstrated that Schwann cells within the distal nerve stump deteriorate and may be unable to regain the capacity for neuronal regeneration into muscle. 4 The goal of the current study was to compare the quality of muscle recovery in microneural repair versus neurotization in a rat model of chronic denervation. 4 -6 The specific aim of this study was to compare 2 surgical strategies for reinnervation of muscle after a period of chronic denervation by assessing the quality of muscle recovery using comparative mass, electrodiagnostics, histologic differences, and muscle strength recovery.

An animal model described by Sulaiman and Gordon using Sprague-Dawley rats was used for experimental testing. 4 Animal surgery was performed under aseptic conditions and ketamine/xylazine anesthesia in accordance with an approved protocol from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Hospital for Special Surgery. Initially, 58 animals had surgical denervation of the right tibialis anterior muscle via a posterior incision. Sciatic, tibial, and peroneal nerves were exposed. 5, 7 The right common peroneal (CP) nerve was identified, transected, and ligated with a 6-0 suture (Prolene, Ethicon, Inc., Sommerville, NJ) to prevent regeneration between the proximal and distal nerve stumps. 8 The distal ligated end was tacked to the popliteal fat for later identification. Wounds were then closed with nylon sutures and surgical staples. Animals recovered in an approved housing facility with monitoring of daily weights, postoperative Buprenex Hydrochloride (Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Richmond, VA) analgesia, and inspection of surgical sites.",

The limb was then secured firmly to a foam board by inserting pins through the distal femur and proximal foot. After releasing its distal insertion, the TA tendon was securely fixed to a 2-kg (5-lb) load cell (MDB-5 Transducer Techniques Load Cell; Transducer Techniques Inc., Temecula, CA) using 2-0 braided polyester suture (Ethibond; Ethicon Inc.) with a locking stitch. The load cell was mounted on a post allowing adjustment of its height with respect to the tendon to ensure that the load cell was aligned with the longitudinal axis of the muscle-tendon unit. The TA muscle-tendon unit was tensioned using a worm gear stage. The innervating nerve of the TA muscle (either the right CP nerve in the repair/no repair/sham cohorts or the implanted peripheral nerve graft in the neurotization cohort) was then dissected free of surrounding tissue. Hook-shaped stimulating electrodes were placed on the nerve 1 cm from the insertion into the TA muscle, distal to the proximal coaptation site. After a maximal response was obtained, a supramaximal stimulus was elicited at 50 Hz for a duration of 1 second to obtain a tetanic contraction. The maximum tetanic contractile force was recorded using a signal conditioner fixed to the load cell (SensoTec Inc, Columbus, OH). Initial animals were tested using a preload force of 0.05 N. A length tension curve was then established to determine the correct amount of tension needed to elicit a maximal force. This was found to require approximately 0.5 N of preload tension. Maximum contractile force was calculated subtracting the initial preload. Three repeated measures were made for each treated and untreated limb, allowing a 5-minute interval for recovery between stimulations.",

A previous study by McNamara et al. found about a 60% difference in rabbit muscle function between the neurorrhaphy technique and neurotization at 2 months after repair. 1 With 6 specimens per group, we are able to detect such a difference in muscle function with repair type (60%) with greater than 95% power and alpha equal to .05. No previous studies have assessed the effects of delayed healing time. Therefore, power was estimated for a difference of 30% with healing time. With 6 specimens per group, we should also be able to detect a difference of 30% with 85% power. These power calculations were made using PASS 6.0 software (NCSS, Kaysville, UT) and were based on a 2-factor fixed-effects analysis of variance with a 2 by 3 design. 4, 11, 13 Upon completion of the study, we ran a 2-way ANOVA with the main outcome, force ratio, as the dependent variable with time and procedure as the fixed factors.

Nerve grafting is employed when end-to-end coaptation of proximal and distal nerves is not tension-free, as can occur after segmental nerve loss.

In the largest clinical series of nerve-to-muscle implantation to date, Brunelli reported grade M4 or M5 return of function in 46 of 51 patients. 14 Mackinnon et al. also described recovery of gastrocnemius muscle function with nerve-to-muscle implantation in a patient with no distal nerve available for repair. 15 However, despite these sporadic reports of successful recovery of motor function, neurotization remains of experimental interest only for most reconstructive surgeons. This bias for direct nerve repair over neurotization has been based on the physiologic premise that neurotization is an inefficient means to reestablish neuromuscular reinnervation at the motor end plates. Accordingly, a procedure that relies on fostering muscle-nerve synapses de novo would be less favorable than a procedure that would restore previously established nerve input. In an animal study by McNamara and colleagues, immediate repair after acute nerve transection using either microsurgical neurorrhaphy, nerve grafting, or neurotization was compared. 1 Results at 6 months demonstrated less efficacy with neurotization than with either neurorrhaphy or nerve grafting. The authors concluded that neurotization could at least partially reinnervate a muscle in an animal model but suggested that nerve grafts may be preferable. Sorbie and Porter implied that the success of neurotization is likely influenced by the length of time between denervation and implantation. 16 To date, no studies have compared the efficacy of neurotization in chronically denervated muscle.",

            "text": "We observed muscle reinnervation and recovery of muscle strength in animals after a period of chronic denervation in both neurotized and directly repaired individuals. We recognize that functional recovery may be better assessed with instruments such as the peroneal functional index, but the compound muscle action potential is an excellent objective indicator of muscle reinnervation, and determining the power of a tetanic contraction is an objective measurement of the strength associated with that degree of innervation. Although animals in the neurotization group demonstrated the ability to reinnervate a chronically denervated muscle via a peripheral nerve graft bridge, animals in the repair group tended to perform better with respect to contractile strength, muscle mass, and electrodiagnostic characteristics. In the setting of acute intervention, our work confirms previous animal and clinical studies that demonstrate direct nerve repair is superior to neurotization. Recent work has focused on the inability of Schwann cells within the chronically denervated distal stump to support axonal reinnervation. Our work suggests that as chronicity of denervation increases, the advantage of direct nerve repair over muscle neurotization becomes less profound; at some duration of denervation, there may be a role for neurotization toward our goal to improve muscle recovery. Additional clinical investigation needs to be performed to determine if neurotization is a viable treatment strategy.",
