The detection of PoRV-LPMV, represents a diagnostic challenge due to the viral RNA being present in very small amounts in tissue samples. In this study, a TaqMan \u00ae real-time PCR assay was designed based on the phosphoprotein gene of PoRV-LPMV, to allow specific amplification and detection of viral RNA in clinical samples. Assay conditions for the primers and probe were optimized using infected PK15 cells and ten-fold serial dilutions of a plasmid containing the whole P-gene. The sensitivity of the developed TaqMan \u00ae assay was approximately 10 plasmid copies per reaction, and was shown to be 1000 fold better than a conventional nested RT-PCR. The performance of this real-time RT-PCR method enables studies of various aspects of PoRV-LPMV infection. Finally, the assay detects all current known variants of the virus.",

The clinical signs vary considerably and depend mainly of the age of the pig. Very young pigs are generally more affected by encephalitis, pneumonia and corneal opacity (Stephano et al., 1988) . However, recent observations suggest that the virus also affects older pigs, with severe signs including high rates of neurological symptoms in both fattening and adult pigs (S\u00e1nchez-Betancourt et al., 2008) , although this has not been experimentally demonstrated. The virus have been characterized and studied at the molecular level (Berg et al., 1991 Linn\u00e9 et al., 1992; Reyes-Leyva et al., 1999; Svenda et al., 1997; Sundqvist et al., 1990 Sundqvist et al., , 1992 , the cellular level (Hjertner et al., 1997 Reyes-Leyva et al., 1997; Wiman et al., 1998) and through experimental infections (Allan et al., 1996; Stephano et al., 1988; Stephano, 2002; Hernandez-Jauregui et al., 2004; Hernandez-Jauregui et al., 2001) .",

The F-gene from these two isolates differed at 16 nucleotides, giving four amino acids changes . In addition to the LPMV/84, the HN-gene has also been sequenced from 10 other isolates originating from 1990 to 2003 (S\u00e1nchez-Betancourt et al., 2008) . Over these years only about 71 nucleotide positions differ in the HN-gene, corresponding to about four percent of the nucleotides in the gene. Since this protein probably is the major immunogenic protein of the virus and is prone to antigenic drift, one can assume that the other internal genes are more conserved, although this has not been shown of PoRV.",

Twenty-two of these samples were recovered from naturally infected pigs and from experimentally infected pigs of PoRV-LPMV; and five samples were obtained from viral isolates in PK15 cell culture from clinical cases recovered from 2008 to 2010 in Mexico. Six tissue samples came from noninfected pigs. Most of the samples were obtained from brain tissue; however, two samples from lung tissue and one from semen were also included. A majority of the samples from the naturally and experimentally infected pigs as well as the viral isolates were positive for PoRV-LPMV, while the specimens from non-infected pigs remained negative (Table 1) .",

Where the virus came from and how it was introduced into pigs is unknown. But it was found that PoRV-LPMV is most closely related to Mapuera virus isolated from a fruit bat in Brazil in 1979 (Wang et al., 2007) . In addition, in 2004 the presence of antibodies to PoRV from a non-hematophagous bat on the subtropical Pacific coast of Mexico was reported (Salas-Rojas et al., 2004) . It is therefore possible that bats introduced the virus to pigs. However, other natural reservoirs are also possible. Until now it has been impossible to study this, since no suitable diagnostic method has been available. To be able to investigate the spread of PoRV-LPMV in nature and in domestic pigs, where the virus now is endemic, a new detection tool is necessary. A real-time RT-PCR assay was therefore developed for PoRV-LPMV, to be able to study these and other aspects of the viral disease.",

This observation is in agreement with those reported by Wiman et al. (1998) . It also shows that this test can be used to study archived material. A small number of infected specimens produced a low fluorescent signal, high Ct value or gave negative results. This was, however, not surprising, as it has been demonstrated by Allan et al.
