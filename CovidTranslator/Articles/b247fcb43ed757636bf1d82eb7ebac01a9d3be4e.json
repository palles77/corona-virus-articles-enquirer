The first isolation technique employed was the rat antibody production test (RAP) which is analogous to the mouse antibody production test (MAP) described by ROWE et al. (16) and which is used extensively in our laboratory for detection of adventitious virus contamination in various biologic systems. SPF CD Fischer rats from CRBL (area 13) were selected for virus isolation attempts since this colony had a high incidence of MHV CF reactive antibody and was free of other common indigenous viruses of rats, including Kilham rat virus (KRV), H-1 (Toolan), Sendal, and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). Pools of kidneys, intestines, liver, or lungs were prepared from 5 rats each, and made into 10~o extracts. Each tissue extract was inoculated into 2 or 3 weanling age NL Fischer rats by a combined intranasal (0.1 ml) intraperitoneal (0.5 ml) route, and 28 days later their sera were tested for MHV CF reactive antibody. In no case did kidney, liver or intestine extracts induce an RAP response; however, 8 of l0 lung pools from 25-and 35-day old rats induced antibody in the RAP test. A strain of virus, designated 8190, was isolated from one of these pools by inoculating 4 litters of rats by the intranasal route and harvesting their lungs after 7 days. A filtrate (0.03 Selas) of this pool, titrated by RAP, induced MHV antibody through a dilution of 10 -4, which was the highest dilution tested. This pool was used as a starting material for the tissue culture passage. This isolate and subsequent virus pools prepared from this isolate were negative for bacterial and mycoplasma 4 contamination. Lung suspensions and subsequent cell culture pools of RCV were tested for contamination by other adventitious viruses using the RAP and MAP tests. No evidence of contamination and thus no serologic cross relationship was detected for the following viruses: KRV, PVM, H-1 In addition to the RCV isolates obtained from the CI~BL rat colony, 2 isolates also were made from lung suspensions of two 6-week old rats from the animal production section of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., U.S.A. Isolations were made by the RAP test and directly in cell culture. Tubes of RKCC inoculated with the lung extracts showed typical CPE and were positive for RCV CF antigen on the 6th day. consisting of holes in the cell sheet containing strands of bizarre, irregular, dark cell masses (Figs. l, 2); these generally represent degenerated giant cells. Many of the cells show a long, thin, beaded cytoplasmic process extending across the hole. The CPE develops and progresses rapidly, and titration endpoints are reached within 3 days. While all isolates produced a CF antigen in RKCC no hemagglutinins were detected in tests using mouse, chicken, human type 0, guinea pig, or sheep erythrocytes at incubation temperatures of 4 ~ 22 ~ and 37~",

Block CF titrations, in which cell culture antigens were used, tested the four possible combinations of RCV and MHV antigen and antibody (Table 1) . While the RCV and MHV antigens (8 units) were nearly comparable for detecting MHV antibody, the t~CV antigen was much more sensitive than MHV antigen in detecting I~CV antibody but this was overcome by using higher unitage of MHV antigen. Tissue culture neutralization tests revealed a low level cross neutralization (Table 1) . The sensitivity of I~CV and MHV-polyvalent CF antigen for the detection of naturally occurring RCV antibody was compared. A group of 34 rat sera consisting of random samples from each of 3 positive colonies (12, 12, and 10 sera each) were tested at initial 1 : 10 serum dilutions using 16 I%CV and 32 MHV CF antigen units. RCV antigen was about a third more sensitive than MHV, detecting 27 versus 21 positive sera. Also, the RCV antigen gave higher antibody titers in most of the positive sera.",

Discussion Characterization of the infectious agent isolated from the lungs of normal rats indicated that the agent was a virus and fulfilled all the criteria for belonging to the proposed (1) coronavirus classification group (Table 2) . Electron mi-J.C. PARKER, S. S. CROSS, and W. P. Row]~: croscopic studies revealed a morphology similar to other members of the coronavirus group which include MHV, IBV, and viruses isolated from the upper respiratory tract of humans (4, 9, 11) . The virus, termed rat coronavirus (RCV), was serologicMly distinct by the I%AP test from other viruses found to occur as indigenous virus infections in rodents (rats, mice, and hamsters). The agents associated with enzootic bronchiectasis (12) and endemic pneumonia (8) of rats were not available for comparison to I~CV; however, the identity of these agents as viruses is not convincing and it has been suggested that they are in fact mycoplasma (5) . The virus isolated from the submaxillary glands of rats by Aslt~ et al. (2) is distinguishable from RCV on the basis of different physical properties.",

            "text": "I~CV is serologically related to MHV, a similarity which initiated the present study and led to the isolation of RCV. However, although MHV and RCV are serologically and morphologically related, they are clearly two separate and distinguishable viruses. MHV and RCV produce similar CPE, but each in a different cell line which is not reciprocally infected by the other virus. The two viruses differ markedly in their pathogenicity. The MHV complex produces encephalitis and hepatitis in mice and is normally an enteric infection (15) , while RCV produces peumonitis in rats, and is almost certainly spread by the respiratory route. While MHV and I~CV are related viruses as shown by CF and neutralization tests, McI~Tos~ et al. (11) showed in an analogous manner that MHV and some of the IBV-like coronaviruses isolated from human respiratory tracts are also relate& A number of technical problems have made it difficult to obtain information on t~CV. The widespread prevalence of RCV in rat colonies together with other frequently occurring respiratory viruses of rats, such as Sendai virus and PVM virus (14) , have made it difficult to obtain suitable animals needed to carry out routine laboratory procedures, infectivity titrations, production of lung grown virus uncontaminated with other agents, and preparation of monotypie antisera. Inadvertent eontamination of rat kidney tissue culture with Kilham rat virus and It-1 virus occurred when rats from a colony harboring these indigenous infections were used for tissue culture. The use of germfrce rats circumvented many of these problems; however, even with the use of germfree rats many lots of primary rat kidney tissue culture were observed to undergo a spontaneous CPE which was distinct from that produced by I~CV. l~ecently a virus-like agent has been isolated from one of these degenerating cultures and presently is being studied. This agent is cyclic or seasonal and during periods of high prevalence tissue culture studies with RCV were not possible. In spite of these difficulties it has been possible to work with RCV, but only as the result of routine and extensive monitoring for indigenous virus infections of rat colonies and of tissue cultures for viral contamination. The narrow tissue culture range also presents great difficulties. Of the many tissue culture systems tested, only the rat kidney cell culture system was sensitive, and even this was not sensitive unless the cultures contained a large number of epithelial type cells.",
