Objectives: We determined the burden of disease due to HCoV-NL63 infections using the population-based PRI.DE cohort of children under the age of 3 with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Study design: In total 1756 respiratory samples, from hospitalized children or children who visited the outpatient clinic, were tested for HCoV-NL63. Sampling covered a period of 2 years and the frequency of infection in different years was compared to other Western European studies that tested for this virus in 2 or more consecutive years. Results: Sixty-nine samples were HCoV-NL63 positive, 35 were with high loads, and of these 25 were single HCoV-NL63 infections. Based on the number of children with high HCoV-NL63 infection and no additional infection, the overall annual incidence in outpatients was 7 per 1000 children per year (95% confidence interval (CI) 3-13 per 1000 children per year), which can be extrapolated to an absolute number of 16,929 visits to the physician due to an HCoV-NL63 infection in Germany per year. The estimated hospitalization rate is 22 per 100,000 children (95% CI: 7-49 per 100,000 children per year). This number reflects 522 HCoV-NL63 children in Germany per year. A large year-to-year difference in HCoV-NL63 infection frequency was observed. Combining these data with those of other studies in Western Europe revealed that HCoV-NL63 infections follow a 2-year inter-epidemic period with peaks of infection in the winters of (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: HCoV-NL63 infection in children below 3 years of age often requires a visit to the physician in an outpatient clinic, especially during peak-years, but hospitalizations are relatively infrequent.",

Signs and symptoms were defined according to Denny and Clyde. 14 Recruitment covered the period from November 1999 to October 2001. Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) were collected in a standardized manner as described. 13 Of the 3.677 NPS that were collected within the PRI.DE study, half were randomly assigned to this study. The randomization was performed via a program generating random numbers in order to distribute samples equally between 2 different laboratories. The ethics committee of each participating center approved the study protocol and written informed consent was obtained from parents of all children. RNA was extracted and tested for RSV, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, influenza viruses and HCoV-NL63 by hexaplex PCR and real-time RT-PCR as described. 10 Samples collected in France (winter 2003/2004) and the Netherlands (2002 till 2005) that were screened for HCoV-NL63 were analyzed as described. 6, 15 Furthermore, data from literature were included only for those studies that screened consecutive years in Western Europe and in which each year the sample selection criteria did not change.

In total 1756 PRI.DE samples are included in the present study, representing 48% of the total number of samples that were collected. To confirm whether the HCoV-NL63-tested samples were representative for the entire PRI.DE study (which comprised 3677 children), we checked collection dates, study region, age, male/female distri- Similar to what was published previously 10 a high frequency of croup was noted in the HCoV-NL63 infected children (26.1% of all HCoV-NL63 positives, p < 0.0001 two-sided Fisher's exact test).",

            "text": "The peak of infection was centered around the winter months of each year (Fig. 1) . When we include all HCoV-NL63 infections (n = 69) to calculate the burden of disease, a total of 16 visits to the physician per 1000 children per year were calculated, corresponding to 37,841 visits to a physician per year in Germany. The hospitalization rate is 85 per 100,000 children per year, corresponding to 2022 hospitalizations per year in Germany. However, during double infections it is debatable whether one or the combination of the two viruses causes the disease encountered. Double infections with HCoV-NL63 and a second respiratory virus were frequently found (49.3%). Furthermore we observed a very strong association between a high HCoV-NL63 viral load and single infec- tions, and in case of double infections the viral load was low (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon's two sample test). 10 To ascertain that the disease burden is calculated for HCoV-NL63 infections only and not influenced by infections with another respiratory virus we included only those infections which were not accompanied by a second respiratory virus (n = 35). Furthermore we included merely HCoV-NL63 infections with high viral load, which was arbitrarily defined as samples with more than 10,000 copies per ml (n = 25). Using these restrictions we calculated that the annual incidence of HCoV-NL63 infection was 7 per 1000 children per year (95% confidence interval (CI) 3-13 per 1000 children per year), reflecting an absolute number of 16,929 visits to the physician in Germany per year (95% CI: 7255-31,440). The estimated hospitalization rate due to HCoV-NL63 alone is 22 per 100,000 children (95% CI: 7-49 per 100,000 children per year). This number reflects 522 children in Germany per year (95% CI: 166-1163), which is a conservative estimate.",

Therefore, sampling in paediatric practices provides the opportunity to collect a representative patient set that reflects the population of German children that are ill but not hospitalized. Most studies that have looked at the frequency of HCoV-NL63 infection in patients with respiratory infections have focused exclusively at hospitalized patients. In the PRI.DE study it is possible to investigate the frequency of infection in both groups: those hospitalized and those visiting the paediatric clinic (outpatients). In a previous study we noticed that HCoV-NL63 infection is observed more frequently in outpatients, 10 and here we calculated that it reflects almost 17,000 visits to the paediatrician each year in Germany, whereas less than 600 children under the age of 3 years need to be hospitalized.",

The difference in age of the test populations is unlikely to explain the difference. We think that other reasons are more significant. In the Hong Kong study all HCoV-NL63-children were included regardless of the viral load in the NPA, or the presence of a second infection. Furthermore, only a single year was monitored in Hong Kong, and we noticed that the incidence of HCoV-NL63 displays year-to-year differences with a 3-4 times higher rate in uneven winters in Western Europe. We did not include any double infections and HCoV-NL63 infections with low viral load, to diminish the chance that children who are ill due to another respiratory virus infection are counted. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that we even missed some double infections since our samples were not tested for all respiratory pathogens (e.g. hMPV, human bocavirus, and rhinoviruses).",
