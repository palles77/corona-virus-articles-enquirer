We divide the population into subgroups in which the periods of disease protection are the same for all persons in a subgroup. For example, consider a subgroup in which antibiotic protection begins at time t 1 and stops at time t 2 , then we set t 3 to infinity in equation (1). Suppose further that post-exposure vaccine protection is achieved at t v , which occurs before antibiotic protection stops (t v , t 2 ), then t 2 and t 3 are set to infinity. If vaccine protection occurs after antibiotic protection stops then t 3 is set equal to t v . The cumulative probability of disease in the population (c) is then a weighted average of the values of c for each subgroup, where the weights are the proportions of people in subgroups. These proportions are determined by the distributions of times in which vaccine immunity is achieved, and the antibiotic start and stop dates (determined by antibiotic adherence rates and efficacy). Among persons exposed to the ID(P), the percentage of cases prevented with post-exposure interventions is:",

Like other pandemic influenza strains, the 1918 A/H1N1 strain spread extremely rapidly. A measure of transmissibility and of the stringency of control measures required to stop an epidemic is the reproductive number, which is the number of secondary cases produced by each primary case 2 . Here we obtained an estimate of the reproductive number for 1918 influenza by fitting a deterministic SEIR (susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered) model to pneumonia and influenza death epidemic curves from 45 US cities: the median value is less than three. The estimated proportion of the population with A/H1N1 immunity before September 1918 implies a median basic reproductive number of less than four. These results strongly suggest that the reproductive number for 1918 pandemic influenza is not large relative to many other infectious diseases 2 . In theory, a similar novel influenza subtype could be controlled. But because influenza is frequently transmitted before a specific diagnosis is possible and there is a dearth of global antiviral and vaccine stores, aggressive transmission reducing measures will probably be required.",

The doubling time for an epidemic curve (about three days in the 1918 pandemic) is a function of the reproductive number (R) and the serial interval (n), which is the average time between a primary and secondary case. The magnitude of R determines the intensity of measures required to halt transmission. The components of n, that is, the duration of the latent and infectious periods, determine how and when these measures must be applied. Estimates of R for pandemic influenza vary widely, ranging from 1.68 to 20 (refs 8-12) , and are thus of limited value for pandemic preparation. Furthermore, R depends on both the infectious agent and the host population; for example, estimates for measles vary between rural and urban populations 2 . To our knowledge, there are no estimates of the range of R values that might be expected if a strain similar to 1918 pandemic influenza emerges.",

To address the possibility that these initial R estimates were biased downward-the model ignores the possibility of substantial slowing of exponential growth due to depletion of susceptible hosts, heterogeneous mixing and/or transmission-reducing interventions-we also fit, for each city, the two adjacent weeks of data with the greatest exponential growth rate. The median estimated R (2.7) increased and the interquartile range (2.3, 3.4) widened. The maximum initial (6.3) and extreme (6.5) R estimates were similar. The extreme R values serve as an upper bound; R estimates based on fits of other regions of the epidemic curves tended to be lower than the extreme R values (see Supplementary   Information) .

We know of one previous R estimate for 1918 pandemic influenza, obtained by fitting the entirety of a single curve of influenza deaths from cities across England and Wales 10 . Although the previous estimate was described by its author as having a poor fit to data 10 , and despite the additional assumptions implicit in that analysis, it is reassuring that our R estimates for 1918 A/H1N1 are similar. The median initial and extreme R values are slightly higher than 1957 A/H2N2 and 1968 A/H3N2 pandemic R estimates 8, 11 (see Supplementary Discussion), but are well below that of many other infections 2 . It is likely that an exceptionally high CFP in young adults, rather than an unusually high R, is what distinguishes the epidemic curve of 1918 from more recent pandemics.",

While the 1918 pandemic progressed quite rapidly, our results indicate that 1918 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 was not highly transmissible relative to other influenza subtypes 8, 11 and infectious agents 2 . A similar pandemic with an R 0 of 2-4 could in principle be prevented by vaccinating or administering antiviral prophylaxis to 50-75% of the population, a figure that may require some adjustment owing to heterogeneous mixing patterns in real populations 25 . Unfortunately, controlling a future pandemic will not be so simple. At present, vaccine production capacity and antiviral medication stockpiles are insufficient to provide such broad coverage, even in wealthy countries 3 , although judicious use of available supplies may nevertheless reduce mortality during a pandemic 8 . Control measures based on case identification (for example, contact tracing, isolation, targeted prophylaxis and treatment) that were central to the control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), whose R was similar to that for 1918 influenza [26] [27] [28] , will only be partially successful for influenza 12 . For influenza, unlike SARS, substantial transmission occurs before the onset of case-defining symptoms 12 . This implies that measures that generally reduce contacts between persons, regardless of infection status, may be our most powerful protection against a pandemic until adequate vaccine and antiviral medicines can be produced, at which point mass-vaccination and prophylaxis may be more effective than targeted approaches.",

The short time between primary and secondary cases (n) means that case numbers in a 1918-like pandemic will rise rapidly, with incident infections and the ensuing deaths doubling about every three days. Increased passenger travel relative to 1918 will facilitate the spread of a new virus across the globe. It is imperative that real-time surveillance information be shared freely, and that preventive measures be taken very early in a new pandemic. Therefore, while the relatively modest reproductive number estimated for 1918 pandemic influenza suggests the feasibility of controlling a similar future pandemic, significant planning and investment will be required to facilitate a rapid and effective response.",
