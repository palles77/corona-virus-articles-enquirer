These are not usually regarded as mass gathering events, but nevertheless they pose the same problem in terms of the transmission of pathogens in the situation of a large number of people in a limited space. Currently the civil war in Syria has displaced many people, and diseases like tuberculosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, measles, and polio are a risk. 1 Such conditions also increase the risk of transmission of zoonoses, with expected closer contact to rodents compared to normal conditions. Thus a One Health approach is also needed in this situation. 2 Mass gathering events are theoretically ideal situations for the spread of infections between people from very different and widespread geographical localities, with potentially different immune responses. One of the first events that focused the international health community on mass gathering events was the outbreak of meningitis in 2000-2001 after the Hajj. 3, 4 However, the spread of infections is rarely caused by mass gathering sports events. 5 All previous experiences from different mass gathering show that vaccine preventable diseases is the most important infections like influenza, hepatitis A, polio and meningitis. Three mass gathering held in Africa during the Ebola outbreak accepted participants from West Africa and was able to handle the theoretical risk without any incident. Therefore we believe that the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro should not be cancelled. The number of visitors to the games is a tiny fraction (1%) of other visitors to Zika endemic countries and it will have no measurable effect on the risk of spreading Zika virus, if the games was cancelled. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from China to Hong Kong and further to Canada was not due to a mass gathering, but to infected individuals travelling late in the incubation period or just after the onset of symptoms. 6, 7 The introduction of West Nile virus to North America was probably through wild birds crossing the Atlantic, and it could not have been predicted. Lastly, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Korea was caused by a single traveller waiting in an overcrowded hospital emergency room in South Korea. 8 The Korean MERS-CoV outbreak illustrates how difficult it is to predict the future. MERS was estimated to have a low epidemic potential, 9 and it was pointed out in this Journal that the outbreak was identified as being caused by MERS-CoV because it happened in a country with the resources (knowledge and laboratory facilities) to rapidly identify the virus. 10 ",

Concern about contracting disease at Hajj was the most cited reason for vaccination (73.4%). Those who obtained pre-travel advice were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those who did not seek advice. 20 Since the 2000 and 2001 outbreak, bacterial meningitis has been a high priority for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Several studies have looked at carrier rates of Neisseria meningitidis in Hajj pilgrims, and overall carriage rates of 5-10% were found, comparable to the rate found in populations in non-epidemic settings. 21 In 2000 and 2001, 338 and 316 cases of laboratoryverified Neisseria meningitidis were reported; this fell dramatically to 2-4 cases per year (2013-2015) following the introduction of mandatory immunization with the quadrivalent vaccine. 22 The quadrivalent ACWY polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine has been a visa requirement for Hajj and Umrah since 2002. At the same time the Saudi authorities introduced a vaccination programme for children and adults living in Mecca and Medina, healthcare workers, and government personnel serving the pilgrims. 23 A recent study of bacterial infections and resistance to antibiotics in hospitalized Hajj pilgrims in Mecca found that Escherichia coli was the most common bacterium (28%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was found in 9.6%. 24 The potential spread of bacterial infections between Hajj pilgrims -whether symptomatic or not -is also a concern because of the unrestricted prescription of antibiotics by local pharmacies to the pilgrims. 25 ",

The engineering of live attenuated vaccines has been facilitated by the development of reverse genetics. Using one of these methodologies, viruses deleted in the small envelope (E) protein have been developed. These viruses have been attenuated and have induced protective humoral and cell-based immune responses in hamsters and mice after SARS-CoV challenge. 28 A meta-analysis on the use of face masks and the reduction in risk of upper respiratory infections found a modest effect. 29 Compliance is always higher during a study than in the real-life situation, and making face masks mandatory at mass gatherings is not presently recommended.",
