The respiratory secretions of each child were assayed using RVP Fast in order to detect 17 respiratory viruses, and the RV-positive samples were characterised by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. RVs were identified in 172 cases (29.0%): 48/132 children aged <1 year (36.3%), 80/293 aged 1-3 years (27.3%), and 44/167 aged \u22654 years (26.3%). Sequencing demonstrated that 82 RVs (49.1%) were group A, 17 (10.1%) group B, and 52 (31.1%) group C; 21 (12.2%) were untyped. RVs were found as single agents in 99 cases, and together with two or more other viruses in 73 (40.7%). There were only marginal differences between the different RV groups and between single RV infection and RV coinfections. RV CAP is frequent not only in younger but also in older children, and RV-A is the most common strain associated with it. The clinical relevance of RV CAP seems to be mild to moderate without any major differences between the A and B strains and the recently identified RV C.",

Moreover, analysis of full-genome sequences demonstrated that, in addition to the group A (RV-A) and B RVs (RV-B) classified on the basis of the similarity of partial genetic sequences and responses to certain antiviral drugs, there is also a third group of RVs (RV-C) [10] .

They were subsequently tested using the RVP Fast assay in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., Toronto, Canada). All of the xTAG RVP FAST reagents were provided by Abbott GmbH & Co. (Wiesbaden-Delkenheim, Germany). The RVP Fast assay consists of a single multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with labelled primers, followed by the single-step hybridisation of the PCR products with the fluorescent bead array, and incubation with reporter reagents. The plate was analysed using a Bio-Plex 200 System (Bio-rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy) and its associated software Luminex x PONENT version 3.1 (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., provided by Abbott), and the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) was determined. An MFI above the threshold level determined by the manufacturer for a particular target indicated a positive result for that target. The mean positive fluorescence intensities were established using Tag-It Data Analysis Software (TDAS, Luminex). The RVP Fast assay simultaneously detects influenza A virus (subtyped H1 or H3), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-A and -B, parainflunzavirus-1, -2, -3 and \u22124, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and human bocavirus [13, 14] .

The 40 PCR cycles consisted of a denaturation step (45 s at 95\u00b0C), an annealing step (45 s at 61\u00b0C), and a DNA extension step (1 min at 72\u00b0C). The 549 bp PCR products were visualised after electrophoresis on an ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gel. Positive and negative controls were tested in all of the reactions.",

Parents did not give their consent for the inclusion of their child in 15 cases so that 592 children with radiographically confirmed CAP (311 males; mean age\u00b1SD, 3.2\u00b13.0 years) were enrolled during the four years of the study. More than 50% of them were hospitalized taking into account the severity of the disease (respiratory distress, SpO 2 and radiological findings), and for infants, even in case of mild respiratory involvement, the presence of high fever (axillary temperature \u226539\u00b0C) was considered. Information regarding clinical evolution of the disease and involvement of family members were available for all the children at follow-up. More than 97% of the children received the antibiotic therapy according to the guidelines of the Italian Society of Pediatrics. Among enrolled patients, 435 (73.5%) were positive for at least one virus. RVs were identified in 172 cases (29.0%) and were the second most common infectious agents after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which was found in 188 children (31.7%). A preliminary analysis of the prevalence of RVs and the RV A, B and C subgroups showed that there were no statistically significant differences by year of sample collection; consequently, all of the data collected in the four years were considered together. Table 1 Table 2 shows the RV co-infections. Dual infections were observed in 60 cases (10.1%), triple infections in 11 (1.9%), and quadruple infections in two (0.3%). The most common dual infection was RV + RSV (35 cases) followed by RV + bocavirus (12 cases). RSV was also found in six cases with triple infection and both cases of quadruple infection. The only RV-infected child who had a bacteriapositive blood culture (Streptoccoccus pneumoniae) was co-infected with RV-A and RSV. Table 3 shows the characteristics of the CAP associated with single RV infections by RV group. The differences between the groups were generally marginal. All of the considered demographic and clinical variables were similarly distributed in the three groups with the exception of highgrade fever, which was significantly less frequent in the children infected by RV-C than in those infected with RV-A (p<0.001). Hospitalisation rates and duration were also similar in the three groups, as was drug use. The data regarding the social impact of RV infection showed that, although the rates of absence from the community of the infected child were similar in the three groups, the number of similar illnesses within the family was significantly lower in the children infected with RV-C than in those infected by RV-A (p=0.02). Analysis of the laboratory data showed that neutrophil cell counts were significantly higher in the children infected with RV-C than those infected with RV-A (p=0.02), whereas monocyte counts and CRP levels were significantly lower in the children infected with RV-C than in those infected with RV-A (p=0.04 and p=0.01, respectively). There was no difference in the radiographic characteristics of the three groups. Multivariate analysis confirmed the similarity of the RV groups: the only differences between them related to the RV-C positive cases, which were significantly less frequently associated with high fever (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.40) or a similar illness within the family (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03-0.82) than the RV-A positive cases. Table 4 shows the demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiographic variables associated with single RV infections and co-infections. The only significant differences were in mean age (the children with a single RV infection were older; p=0.0002), and neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, which were, respectively, significantly lower (p=0.001) and significantly higher (p<0.001) in the children with coinfections. Multivariate analysis showed that the only differences between the groups were related to RV-B positive co-infections, which were significantly less frequently associated with high-grade fever (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.82) than RV-A co-infections.

However, given the very large number of infectious agents sought by us, they add significant information concerning the potential causative role of RVs. Using molecular methods capable of identifying 17 different respiratory viruses, we found RVs in more than 28% of our patients with radiographically confirmed pediatric CAP, second only to RSV. The presence of a virus in the nasopharynx of a child with CAP does not necessarily mean that it is the etiological agent because it may only indicate a coincidental upper airways infection, or be due to a carrier state or the prolonged shedding of a pathogen that caused a previous infection. This may be particularly important in the case of RVs because a number of epidemiological studies have shown that they can be found in the respiratory secretions of 12-22% of asymptomatic subjects [18] [19] [20] [21] . We looked for most of the known respiratory viruses with methods able to give reliable results in a short time. However, because all the viral samples were evaluated some days after respiratory specimens' collection, we did not ascertain the impact that the availability of the information due to this method could have had on physician's behavior, particularly as far as antibiotic prescriptions are concerned. This can explain why in almost all our patients antibiotic therapy was initiated and maintained for the entire period recommended by Italian pediatric guidelines for the treatment of CAP. Further studies that evaluate the impact on antimicrobial prescribing of viral findings with methods able to identify multiple viruses should be performed. In our study population, we found RVs as a single agent in about 60% of the children in which RVs were identified. This strongly suggests that RVs were the cause of the CAP diagnosed in many of our study patients, particularly in those in whom very low values of WBC counts and CRP were found. However, it cannot be excluded that in some of these cases RVs could have been associated with bacteria as recently found by Honkinen et al. [22] . Unfortunately, definition of bacterial etiology of lower respiratory tract infections is very difficult, particularly in younger children because the poor co-operation of the patient does not easily permit the collection of the secretions coming from the lower respiratory tract. Moreover, microbiological evaluation of the sputum, as performed by Honkinen et al. [22] , does not necessarily lead to the identification of the true etiology because bacteria might be contaminants from the nasopharynx and are frequently carried by young children. On the other hand, blood culture, that was performed in this study in all the enrolled children, or molecular methods specifically devoted to the identification of bacterial pathogens in blood samples can give only a partial contribution to the solution of the problem because bacteremic CAPs are only the smallest part of the total number of CAPs diagnosed in children.",

This is in line with the finding of Miller et al. [23] who found that CAP is the most frequent cause of RV-associated hospitalisations in children aged 24-50 months, whereas other diseases are more frequent causes in younger patients, and this seems to suggest that, unlike RSV (whose importance is strictly age-related) [24] , RVs are also a frequent cause of CAP in older children. The role of RVs as causes of CAP in older children is further supported by the frequency of RVassociated LRTIs in children aged 1-15 years, including pneumonia severe enough to require mechanical ventilation [25] .",

[28] , who found a significantly higher incidence of severe CAP in children infected by RV-B. However, as said above, this difference may be explained by the possible inclusion of cases with a diagnosis other than CAP. Interestingly, the chest radiographs of a considerable number of the children with CAP and RV infection (regardless of the type of RV) suggested alveolar involvement, a finding that is usually considered indicative of bacterial etiology. However, none of our children with RV infection alone had a blood culture suggesting a concomitant bacterial infection. The fact that some of the patients had received antibiotics before they were enrolled would have limited the possibility of identifying bacteria, but it is reasonable to think that the alveolar CAP was directly due to the RV infection in a large number of cases. On the other hand, alveolar involvement has been previously found in patients with LRTIs due to other viruses such as human metapneumovirus [30] .",

This suggests that RV-C pathogens are less widespread in the community but it is difficult to explain as there are no published data concerning possible differences in the duration of shedding of the various RV strains. Further studies should clarify whether ours is a chance finding or due to a difference in the shedding of RV-C strains.",

            "text": "The clinical importance of viral co-infections is questioned because the data regarding the severity of single and multiple infections are conflicting. It has been found that RVs have no illness-promoting effect in the case of coinfections with RSV or influenza viruses [11] , but it has also been demonstrated that RV and adenovirus coinfections can cause severely obstructive LRTIs [31] . There are few data concerning the possible additive effect of multiple viral infections including RVs in children with CAP. Most of the co-infections observed during our study involved RSV, which may explain why we found only marginal clinical differences between single and multiple infections. The high incidence of co-infections with RSV, a virus that mainly causes lower respiratory tract involvement (including bronchiolitis) in the first months of life, also reasonably explains why the co-infected children had a younger mean age than those with single infections. However, the lack of any significant difference in almost all of the clinical and laboratory findings between the children with single RV infections of all types and RV coinfections confirms that all of the RV strains played a similar clinical role in determining CAP.",

            "text": "This study has three limitations. First of all, it covered only some months of a single year and the activity of respiratory viruses can significantly vary from season to season. Second, it was confined to a single centre and so the cohort of enrolled children may not reflect nationwide RV infection. Third, it only enrolled children attending a hospital and, as it is highly likely that hospital assistance was not sought for some children with milder CAP, our data may not correctly estimate the true importance of RV as a potential cause of pediatric CAP. However, despite these limitations, we believe that our findings extend current knowledge of the clinical importance of RVs as causes of CAP in children. RV-associated CAP seems to be common not only in the first years of life but also in older children, and RV-A is the strain that is most frequently associated with the disease. The clinical relevance of RV-associated CAP seems to be mild-moderate, without any substantial differences between the old A and B strains and the recently identified RV-C. Co-infections with other viruses do not seem to increase the severity of RV-associated CAP. All of these data are important for the management of pediatric CAP, the identification of the pathogens that require further study, and the development of safe and effective vaccines.",
