Since there are many major indications for which no or only unsatisfactory vaccines are available, like AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, the exploitation of novel technologies, like the use of vector-based vac-cine candidates or vector-based production of protective antigens, may eventually allow us to fill the gap of this unmet medical need.

            "text": "An interesting approach for vaccine development based on GM technology is the use of vectors, which carry selected genes encoding antigens that induce protective immunity. They can either be used as vaccines proper, or for the production of antigens that are incorporated in vaccines. The present paper only deals with vectors that are actually used as vaccines and not just for the production of immunogens. Vectors can be classified in three different categories: viral, bacterial, and plasmid [9] . Vectors can either be fully replicative or only cause abortive infection, still allowing the expression of the desired immunogens. They can be administered either parenterally or via mucosal membranes [10] . A major advantage of vector-based GM technology, is that the immunogens of interest are de novo synthesized, thus not only allowing for the induction of antibody and T helper cell mediated immunity, but also for the induction of protective cytotoxic T cell responses, mimicking a natural immune response against the immunogen. This balanced immune response opens pathways that were previously inaccessible with traditional vaccine technology using 'non-live' immunogens. Especially the induction of CD8+ CTL responses may be of particular interest for vaccines against certain virus infections and cancers [11] . Our previous study provides additional insights regarding the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of such technology [12] .",

This resulted in a timeline of vaccine presence per year for 22 indications spanning from 1976 to 2013. Data on registered vaccines from India have been omitted from this analysis, as no information on the dates of application was given in Indian registers. Patents and clinical trials databases comprise of only GM vaccines. The registered database has been used in its entirety, both GM and non-GM vaccines. This visualisation is shown in Fig. 4 . Table 6 provides information on the most frequently used vectors, as mentioned in literature. In total 21 viral, 3 bacterial and 1 plasmid DNA vectors are presented in this table, covering the most essential vectors of each type for vaccine production or delivery. This table shows data on several upcoming vectors, which are being researched, e.g. new subtypes of poxviruses, adenoviruses, and novel bacterial vectors. Furthermore, the table comprises indications mentioned for these vectors, their advantages and challenges. The viral vector part covers general viral vector species, and several important main viral families followed by their relevant species. At this point, viral vectors have been researched in more detail than bacterial vectors. Poxviruses and adenoviruses are most frequently mentioned in literature. Moreover, details on the application of these two viral families and several of their species and subspecies, as vectors for vaccine development, are more common. As demonstrated in Table 7 ",

The definition of GM vaccines was narrowed down by delineation of search terms found in CPC codes and literature. Literature widely acknowledged that, compared to bacterial or DNA vectors, viral vectors have been researched in more detail (Table 6 ). Poxviruses and adenoviruses are referenced often and a lot of details are provided on the use of these families as viral vectors. Nevertheless, pre-existing immunity is still a major obstacle for several viral vectors (Table 6 ). This is of special concern for the use of adenovirus vectors, although several strategies to circumvent this problem have been developed [40, 44, 45, 64] . Interestingly there are many data suggesting that this seems to be les of a problem for MVA based vaccine candidates [65] [66] [67] .",

            "text": "In comparison with viral vectors, DNA and bacterial vectors show potential in this respect, but this require more research. Furthermore there are several other limitations to overcome. The primary limitation of bacterial vectors is their lack of immunogenicity compared with viral vectors [68] . In addition, viruses are relatively easier to work with, since they have less complex genome than bacteria [69] . Although several types of bacteria have been mentioned in literature (e.g. Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacteria, and Shigella spp.), these are not mentioned in the table due to lack of sufficient information on their advantages and disadvantages [39] . The results of the patent search show that the most prominent CPC codes in the patent database on vector-based vaccines cover general information on vectors (C12N15/79, A61K2039/5256, A61K2039/523). These CPC codes do not comprise specific vectors but are general indicators for vector-based vaccines. A large variety of different vector types are being patented for vaccine development (Fig. 1) . According to the patent database, both ''mastadenovirus\" and ''orthopoxvirus: vaccinia/variola\" are the most prominent vectors. Human adenoviruses are part of mastadenovirus genus, which in turn is a large genus of the adenoviridae family. It is notable that orthopoxvirus: vaccinia/variola as well as poxviridae appear in the patent results. The species vaccinia virus and variola virus are part of the genus orthopoxvirus, which belongs to the family of Poxviridae. The explanation behind this seemingly double occurrence is that CPC codes for both the species and the family are present in Espacenet. There is one CPC code for both vaccinia and variola combined, rather than a separate code for each of these species.",

Although no active clinical trials on malaria based on fowlpox vectors are provided in the clinical trials database (clinicaltrial.gov), literature shows that fowlpox vectors are being examined in combination with different vaccination regimens [70, 71] . Intervention strategies for these diseases represent a large unmet medical need, still causing over a million deaths every year [72] . With limited if any cure available, new methods might provide additional value to vaccine research and development, in hope for a breakthrough. This premise is confirmed by Fig. 4 . Cancer, HIV, and malaria show a large presence in both patent and clinical trial databases, while Hib, Hepatitis A, and meningococcus show little development in patent and clinical trials stages in recent years. This implies a lower need for new vaccine technologies for these indications, as current vaccines based on conventional methods are apparently sufficiently satisfactory [73] [74] [75] . Table 7 also shows that very little vector-based vaccine trials are present for more or less treatable diseases such as HPV induced neoplasias, hepatitis B, and influenza. Apparently there is less medical need for vector-based vaccines for these indications, as vaccine candidates are available based on GM-based and non-GM-based techniques [76] [77] [78] . There is, a significant amount of active non-vector-based GM trials for these three indications, demonstrating the variety of GM techniques applied in vaccine development. For influenza and hepatitis B vaccine production, the use of recombinant DNA technology is already common practice [6, 79] . Therefore, the focus of research is on optimising the technology used, rather than on investing in new vector-based technology research.",

The reasons for this replacement is predominantly related to the safety and efficacy of MVA, as it only causes an abortive infection, while inducing an abundant expression of the target immunogen, leading to impressive protective immune responses [12] . The prominent use of adenoviruses as viral vectors is probably due to the considerable knowledge on this virus family, the ease of manipulation of the virus for use in vector-based vaccines, and the broad tissue tropism associated with this virus [40, 80] .",

Without patents, anyone could start developing these vectors without legal consequences, leading to companies competing to sell the vaccine for the lowest price possible. When revenues from vaccine sales eventually do not lead to return on investment for past and future research and development there would be no incentive for the development of new generations of vaccines.

The most promising vectors for vaccine development at this moment appear to be poxvirus and adenovirus vectors. This may be concluded for their abundant use in the development of vaccines against diseases like HIV-AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and different forms of neoplastic disease. It may be expected that the current efforts spent on developing vectorbased vaccines, may lead to promising vaccine candidates for these indications and therefore hold promise for current and future unmet medical needs. Therefore, after the recent eradication of smallpox using Jenner's vaccinia virus as the first vaccine, this and other viruses may now be the basis for constructing vectors that may help us control other major scourges of mankind.",

Indications with a high percentage for vector-based GM vaccine trials are variola (89%), epstein-barr (67%), HIV (56%), tuberculosis (TB) (42%), cancer (38%), and malaria (38%). Indications that have very little vectorbased trials are influenza (3%), human papillomavirus (HPV) (1%), and hepatitis B (1%). The most prominent vectors are the vaccinia virus (modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) & New York strain (NYVAC), 36.3%) and adenoviruses (17.7%). The cumulative frequency of the aforementioned vectors per year is shown in Fig. 2. Results from this graph and table illustrate a significant increase in MVA and adenovirus application over the years, while growth of vaccines based on vaccinia virus, ALVAC, and fowlpox virus has stagnated. The results from our registered vaccines search show that the first vector-based vaccine registered for use on the market is IMO-JEV (2010), a Japanese Encephalitis vaccine, based on a yellow fever virus (family Flaviviridae) vector [61]. The second is the tetravalent dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia (2015) comprising a Yellow Fever virus (YFV) encoding two JE viral proteins[62].",
