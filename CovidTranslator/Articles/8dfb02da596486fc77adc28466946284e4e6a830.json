Though bed bugs are not direct vectors for transmitting infectious disease, they can cause human discomfort and various health problems, including allergic reactions, secondary infections, and emotional stress (Goddard & deShazo, 2009; Harlan, 2006) . Recently, this small pest has made a strong comeback due to (1) increased travel to and from places where bed bugs remain common (Romero, Potter, Potter, & Haynes, 2007) , (2) an evolution of bed bugs' resistance to pesticides (Romero et al., 2007) , and (3) people's lack of knowledge about preventing and controlling bed bugs (CDC & EPA, 2010) . In addition to the occurrence of bed bugs in unclean locations and developing countries, bed bug infestations are now very common in developed countries. The United States has been overwhelmed with bed bug complaints, and the number of reported cases has climbed consistently in the last five years (CDC & EPA, 2010; National Pest Management Association, 2013) . A recent national survey shows that bed bugs are found in all 50 states in the US, and vary in prevalence from private residences to public places, such as hotels/motels, airports, and restaurants (National Pest Management Association, 2013) . Indeed, as international travel continues to grow, it is impossible for hospitality and tourism establishments to become completely immune from bed bug infestation (NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2013) .",

The news media serves as one of the primary information sources for the public, and regularly reports on health related issues (Coleman, Thorson, & Wilkins, 2011; Pew Research Center, 2008) . However, the media can also elevate the true significance of the health issue. Previous research has found that news coverage surrounding crisis issues can produce unexpected news shocks, which generate negative effects on a tourism destination and lead to economic recession in the tourism sector (Kim & Wong, 2006) . The true impact of the crisis may be minimal, but the news media make it a significant concern, such as the case with the recent coverage of the rise in cases of chicken pox and measles in Toronto (Chai, 2014) . Therefore, scholars suggest that attention should be paid to the PR function of news media, especially within the area of tourism crisis management (Fall, 2004; Paraskevas & Altinay, 2013; Stacks & Carroll, 2005) .",

Recognizing that each health issue is unique in nature, and that media framing is dynamic process of reinforcement, scholars address that it is impossible to generalize findings from one single research study to another and that a situational approach is necessary (Shih et al., 2008) . Bed bugs have been frequently reported by news media (Anderson & Leffler, 2008) , but empirical research examining messaging by the news media is embryonic. When considering the potential impact of a health-related crisis and the critical role news media played in crisis communication, it is necessary for the tourism and hospitality industry to have a comprehensive understanding of media frames. Given that, this research aimed to fill the knowledge gap by identifying the main frames that have been used in news coverage of bed bugs, and to provide empirical references for practitioners in order to increase their preparedness and to create effective response strategies toward a health-related crisis.",

The role of news coverage in tourism crisis management It has been widely acknowledged that media plays an important role in the hospitality and tourism business, where media content has the potential to shape tourists' evaluation of a destination and to influence their selection of tourism products (S\u20ac onmez & Graefe, 1998) . Indeed, an effective use of media strategy advances the advertising and marketing of tourism products and hospitality services; however, the tourism crisis management function performed by mass media, which is an important toolkit, has been overlooked (Crotts & Mazanec, 2013; Fall, 2004) . Crisis events have been frequently reported on mass media and this type of coverage can damage the hospitality and travel industry in many ways, such as disruption of daily operation, impaired reputation of the industry, and increased hesitation of traveling. Cumulatively, an unfavorable destination image as well as revenue reduction in the tourism sector may occur as a result of the crisis media coverage, the lack of attention on this issue, as well as the inefficiency of crisis management practices (Fall, 2004) .",

To measure the destination image that featured within news coverage, scholars use two dimensions: one is the quantity, which examines elements such as the number of news reports, the length of news articles, and the section and pages in which the news item is published; the other one is the nature, which focuses on subtle perspectives and addresses the content of the news article (Avraham & Ketter, 2008) . However, in order to increase the \"story value\" and to compete for the scarce spaces in newspaper, journalists have the tendency to cover crisis events selectively, deliberately focusing on serious risks (Kasperson & Kasperson, 1996) . Such social amplification process of risks can exert effects on the hospitality and tourism industry, where studies found that the outbreaks of crises, manifested as media events, can lead to destabilization in tourism flow and decrease in tourism income within a destination (S\u20ac onmez, Apostolopoulos, & Tarlow, 1999) . Thus, it is believed that understanding how a crisis is framed by news media can provide meaningful insights to crisis managers to create appropriate crisis response strategy and to minimize the damages brought by a crisis event (Coombs, 2007) . In the field of tourism crisis management, the need for further research in this area has been brought to the frontline as a prominent concern (Crotts & Mazanec, 2013).",

An individual frame explained \"how audience make sense of news\" (Scheufele, 1999, p. 107) ; while a media frame referred to \"a central organizing idea or story line that provides meaning to an unfolding strip of events \u2026 the frames suggest what the controversy is about, the essence of the issue\" (Gamson & Modigliani, 1987, p. 143 ) (see cited in Scheufele, 1999, p. 106) .

            "text": "In a tourism context, framing analysis enables researchers to obtain a general understanding of media frames that used to portray a tourism destination, to explore the social-cultural element of tourism narratives, and to reveal the interplay of media discourse and tourism practices (Santos, 2004a; Wu et al., 2012) . Some studies attempted to depict the framed image of a tourism destination in mass media. For example, Santos (2004a) has content analyzed travel news articles from four U. S newspapers and identified two frames that used to represent Portugal as a tourism destination. Hamid-Turksoy, Kuipers, and Van Zoonen (2014) used a similar approach and examined the destination image of Turkey in the British news coverage. Equipped with a constructive paradigm, some studies used framing analysis to emphasize other elements associated with a tourism destination. For instance, Buzinde and Santos (2008) conducted a textual analysis of tourism promotional materials and identified main frames that were used to represent the slavery theme within a cultural heritage site. By revealing the media discourse process, they (Buzinde & Santos, 2008) also documented the process of creating collective memory via the means of framing. Using framing analysis, Wu et al. (2012) reported the holiday system reform process in China and indicated the influences of government policies on a tourism destination. Some scholars attempted to express the framing process from an audience's perspective. Santos (2004b) , for example, examined college students' perception and interpretation of leisure articles that appeared in newspapers. The results of the study revealed three central themes as well as the role of writers in readers' perception (Santos, 2004b) . Rozier-Rich and Santos (2011) further examined how tourists processed the promotional materials and addressed the role of skepticism in travel promotional communication.",

When reporting a crisis event, previous literature noted that a small number of media frames have appeared constantly in the news: conflict, economic, consequence, human interest and morality (Neuman, 1992) . With an attribution process, however, two news frames can be further identified, namely, episodic news frame, which focused on individuals or a single event, and thematic news frames, which \"placed issues and events in a general context, such as organizational or societal\" (An & Gower, 2009, p. 108) . A content analysis of crisis news coverage suggested that although all five frames (conflict, economic, consequence, human impact and morality) were present when reporting a crisis event, the usage of a specific frame differed by crisis type, as did the level of attributions (episodic and thematic) (An & Gower, 2009 ).",

A consistency of these six frames was observed when comparing news coverage reporting avian flu, mad cow disease and West Nile virus (Shih et al., 2008) . Another study (Liu & Kim, 2011 ) also demonstrated the validity of this typology through content analyzing different organizations' media framing of 2009 H1N1 pandemic. In addition to the content of a health-related news story, previous studies (Chapman, 2001; Coleman et al., 2011; Iyengar, 1994) suggested that understanding whether the issue was framed as episodic or thematic was extremely significant. The attention to this area was highlighted because the type of message framing (episodic/thematic) could influence public's perception of a health issue, determine the urgency of a health problem within society, and further drive individuals' health behavior (Coleman et al. 2011 ).",

Framing analysis has become distinguished from other theoretical approaches, since it acknowledges the symbolic power of news text, follows the \"assumption of the rule-governed nature of text formation,\" and emphasizes the cognitive impact of audiences' producing and consuming news content (Pan & Kosicki, 1993, p. 58) . Consequently, it is believed that the use of framing analysis in this study can help researchers obtain a general understanding of media discourse concerning bed bugs, and further explore the potential impact on the hospitality and travel industry (D'Angelo & Kuypers, 2009; Hertog & McLeod, 2001; Pan & Kosicki, 1993) .",

The coding instrument consisted of basic information about the article, the appearance of an attribution frame, the mention of the hospitality and tourism industry, and the presence of a health-crisis related frame. The basic information included the published date, news organization, published section, and word count of the story. With respect to the attribution frames, previous literature (An & Gower, 2009; Chapman, 2001) has identified two categories: (1) Episodicdif the news story only reported one single incident and being personal or victim focused; and (2) Thematicdif the news has covered multiple events, discussed the topic as a broad problem and/or associated it with a social issue. Further, the mention of the hospitality and travel industry was coded with its appearance in a news story. Acknowledging that bed bug infestation has become a challenge for public health (CDC & EPA, 2010) , and that bed bug infestation can be crisis in nature, a typology of health-crisis related frames (Liu & Kim, 2011; Shih et al., 2008) was adopted as the primary coding scheme for news frames.",

The sample articles tended to present the seriousness of bed bug infestation in three ways. Taking a medical perspective, the first focus concentrated on the serious outcome produced by bed bugs on personal health. For example, one news article quoted a doctor's accounts of his patients' pain from being attacked by bed bugs as \"sacrificing themselves because they are literately being eaten as they sleep.\" Second, the selected articles attempted to emphasize the catastrophic nature of bed bug infestation, using metaphors. One news article in the New York Times quoted a doctor, commenting that, \"It [bed bug infestation] really is like H1N1 \u2026. Everybody is concerned about it, wondering if they'll be next\". And another lady was also quoted, saying that \"It's [bed bug infestation] like terrorism \u2026, Just cross your fingers and keep going.\" Third, by citing and listing numbers, the sample articles tried to depict the prevalence of bed bug plague comprehensively. For instance, one news article reported the intense condition of New York City as \"the city just declared war on bed bugs, citing a 2000% rise in complaints since 2005.\" Another news article used industry data to demonstrate the growing trend of bed bug infestation, as it said, \"Western Exterminator Co., which serves California, reported a 240% increase in bedbug work from 2000 to 2006.

A handful of the included articles (43.2%, n \u00bc 38) discussed the uncertainty aspect of bed bugs. According to the sample articles, it was known that, \"the only way to get rid of bed bugs is extermination by a professional\"; but \"entomologists say it is unclear why the pest have made a comeback.\" Despite that a variety of solutions have been offered in these news reports, such as heat treatment, snowy spray, and sniffing dogs, remedying the bed bug issue was still challenging. In one article featured in the Wall Street Journal, an entomology professor commented: \"We don't have any easy method of elimination, \u2026 We are looking for the silver bullet.\" Action and reassurance. With 33 stories each, action and reassurance (37.5%, n \u00bc 33), were frames that frequently presented in bed bug news coverage. The action frame included stories that highlighted actual measures aimed at combating the bed bug problem, such as a company taking necessary steps to eradicate the bed bug problem, EPA holding a national bed bug summit, and government establishing bed bug related policies. The reassurance frame was characterized by stories expressing the idea that the public should not be worried about this issue. These two frames were closely tied because actions could always deliver a sense of relief to the general public. For instance, one article in the New York Times said that holding a bed bug summit is a great opportunity in which \"the two-day conference brought together the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Pentagon, state and Federal housing officials, experts, and exterminators to help fight the invasion.\" Similarly, another news article in the Los Angeles Times explicated a sense of ecstasy and gladness: \"Fortunately, the Federal government is on the case.\"",

Meanwhile a small amount of articles (31.8%, n \u00bc 28) have expressed contradictory viewpoints, arguing whether bed bug infestation should be defined as a major public health threat like other health epidemics. The connection between these two frames was obvious, in that lacking a clear consensus about bed bugs not only confined our understanding of this issue, but also limited the opportunity to conduct advanced research in this area. As one Washington Post article commented, \"research on the public health effects of the bugs has not received much support because even though their bites can provoke allergic reactions, unlike ticks and mosquitoes they are not known to spread disease.\" And as a result, \"some researchers say they fear that the federal bureaucracy can't move fast enough to address the growing infestations.

Regardless of the specific news media, the primary findings shows that the selected news articles framed bed bug infestation as a typical health crisis, consistently using frames of consequence, uncertainty, action, reassurance, new evidence and conflict (An & Gower, 2009) . Although a similar framing typology has been observed, the predominance of consequence frame and the emergence of the new frame seriousness suggest that the selected news articles display their keen awareness on substantive aspects of the bed bug infestation, especially on its potential risks. This implies that the actual risks that are associated with bed bugs might be attenuated within the social context (Kasperson & Kasperson, 1996) . Intriguingly, previous research notes that action frame has always been associated with the frame of consequence, because the public expects to receive effective crisis response either from the government or from the relevant organizations (Liu & Kim, 2011; Shih et al., 2008) . Such decreased focus on action may account for the emergence of the new frame seriousness, since intensive attention has been displayed on the outcome of the crisis instead of effective actions that combat the problem. Thus, the notion of seriousness cannot be merely taken as a superficial element that added to the news value; instead, it suggests the society may receive an incorrect message, generate a misperception of bed bug crisis, and therefore exaggerate the severity (Kasperson & Kasperson, 1996) . Additionally, this study notices the differences that exist between different newspapers in terms of the use of episodic and thematic frames. By offering a specific example or particular case, the use of episodic frame is more frequently associated with individuals and tend to generate the emotional response from the audience, such as sympathy, empathy and the sense of understanding; while the thematic frame is normally positioned with in a broader context and under this circumstance audiences are more likely to attribute the responsibility of the issue at an aggregated level (Liu & Kim, 2011) . The type of newspaper may account for the differentiation of using thematic and episodic frames, but noticeably, readers may tend to ascribe the responsibility of a bed bug infestation to an organization, to the industry, or to the government.",

Findings of this study confirm hospitality and travel industry as frequently cited in the bed bug news coverage. This in part can be explained by the fact that international travel has been blamed as one of the main reasons causing the bed bug resurgence and that hotels are one of the most common locations where people encounter bed bugs (Harlan, 2006; National Pest Management Association, 2013) . However, this finding is alarming for the hospitality and travel industry. Tourists, who are equipped with limited knowledge of bed bug infestation and insufficient information of a new destination, rely on news media for information (S\u20ac onmez et al., 1999) . During a crisis event, tourists construct their risk perception on a subjective base (S\u20ac onmez & Graefe, 1998; S\u20ac onmez et al., 1999 ). When exposed to news coverage that consistently frames bed bug infestation as a typical health epidemic and repeatedly refers to the hospitality and travel industry, it is natural for them to perceive bed bug infestation as a threat to their health and place the bed bug issue at the frontline of their concerns.",

The use of thematic frame acts as a strong indicative of the social amplification process of risks, and the use of consequence frame demonstrates the focus of public attention. In terms of the rippling effects, individuals, who are aware of the negative consequences of bed bug infestation, may interpret the incident as a serious social issue that specifically links to the tourism sector (Kasperson & Kasperson, 1996) . Similarly, tourists may regard bed bug infestation as a salient issue and therefore generate an increased level of perceived risk (S\u20ac onmez et al., 1999) . Meanwhile such an assumption can also pose a reputational threat to the hospitality organization and even stigmatize the whole destination as bed bug infested (Coombs, 2007) . Consequently, a short-term outcome may be reflected as tourists' tendency of avoiding a destination, and a long-term outcome may be manifested as a distorted destination image that embedded with the public cognitively (Kozak et al., 2007; S\u20ac onmez & Sirakaya, 2002) .",

Mass media, which bridges the communication gap between the industry and the potential customers, can act as one of the core detectors for the industry to diagnose a potential crisis (Paraskevas & Altinay, 2013; Stacks & Carroll, 2005) . As an essential step, crisis managers should pay attention to media content and monitor the media discourse surrounding crisis issues that are important to the hospitality and travel industry. Such an attempt not only can help practitioners acquire an understanding of public concerns that may influence people's decision on consuming tourism products, but also can benefit the company in establishing public relation campaigns that cope with specific crises in advance and building positive brand images with a long-term perspective (Stacks & Carroll, 2005) .",

            "text": "Many practitioners now limit themselves to the marketing and advertising function of mass media, without recognizing the capability of mass media as a tourism crisis management strategy (Fall, 2004 ). An effective crisis management plan requires both internal and external crisis communication, where internal communication refers to maintaining smooth crisis information flow within a hospitality organization, and external communication largely demands an adequate use of mass media (Ritchie, 2008 ). An implementation of crisis communication strategy via news media therefore becomes important. Particularly, scholars suggest that three aspects need to be stressed, namely, media source, message, and target audience (Avraham & Ketter, 2008) . First, it is the hospitality organization's responsibility to ensure that transparent and open conversations and dialogues are maintained during the special times of crisis. To satisfy the public's need of crisis related information, crisis mangers need to guarantee that the media source is under control and the crisis situation is communicated appropriately. Second, it is imperative for the hospitality organizations to employ a proper crisis response that matches the crisis situation (Coombs, 2007) . For example, a recent study notices that tourists, who were attacked bed bugs in hotel rooms during their stay in the New York City, expected corrective actions as a suitable response from the hotel end (Liu, Pennington-Gray, Donohoe, Omodior, in press ). In light of this, to repair the brand image and remedy the negative outcomes following a bed bug crisis, hospitality practitioners in the future should address their actions combating the bed bug issue in response to potential customers' concerns. Third, and of equal importance, crisis managers should strive to learn about their market and locate the target audience (Avraham & Ketter, 2008) . Practitioners need to conduct exhaustive market analysis on a regular basis, which can help them profile current customers as well as segment the potential market.",

            "text": "The present study was not without drawbacks. The limited sample size is a main concern. But given the representativeness of the sample articles and the sharp increase in the volume of news reporting bed bug infestation among the nation (Anderson & Leffler, 2008) , findings of this study are still meaningful. Meanwhile, to establish a more comprehensive understanding, future research should attempt to cover a wider diversity of news media and to include a larger sample size. Another concern has been due to the fact that the current study has displayed its main focus on media frames, while Scheufele (1999) suggested that framing is a dynamic process in which both media and the audience was involved and intertwined. Results of our analysis confirm that the media frames surrounding bed bugs follow the general crisis literature. Based on such findings, future research can take a step further and to examine the interaction with audience frames, especially on how bed bug media coverage may influence tourists' risk perception and their subsequent travel decisions.",
