To track the behavior of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in the infected cells in real time, we produced an infectious recombinant ASFV (B54GFP-2) that expresses and incorporates into the virus particle a chimera of the p54 envelope protein fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The incorporation of the fusion protein into the virus particle was confirmed immunologically and it was determined that p54-EGFP was fully functional by confirmation that the recombinant virus made normal-sized plaques and presented similar growth curves to the wild-type virus. The tagged virus was visualized as individual fluorescent particles during the first stages of infection and allowed to visualize the infection progression in living cells through the viral life cycle by confocal microscopy. In this work, diverse potential applications of B54GFP-2 to study different aspects of ASFV infection are shown. By using this recombinant virus it was possible to determine the trajectory and speed of intracellular virus movement. Additionally, we have been able to visualize for first time the ASFV factory formation dynamics and the cytophatic effect of the virus in live infected cells. Finally, we have analyzed virus progression along the infection cycle and infected cell death as time-lapse animations.",

            "text": "ASFV assembly occurs in viral factories that contain high levels of viral structural proteins, viral DNA, and amorphous membranous material used to produce viral envelopes. The 170-kb genome of ASFV encodes some 150 open reading frames, and as many as 50 viral proteins are incorporated to the viral particle (Esteves et al., 1986) . Approximately 35% of the mass of the virion is provided by p72, the major capsid protein, while the structural proteins p150, p37, p34 and p14, all of them derived from polyprotein p220, provides another 25% of the virion mass (Andres et al., 1997) . ASFV particles assemble within cytoplasmic viral factories from endoplasmic reticulum-derived viral membranes (Andres et al., 1997 Rouiller et al., 1998) at perinuclear sites (Nunes et al., 1975) that contain fully assembled virions seen as 200-nm-diameter hexagons in cross-section, and a series of one to six-sided assembly intermediates (Rouiller et al., 1998) . Morphological evidence indicates that viral membranes become icosahedral particles by the progressive construction of the outer capsid layer, which is composed mainly of viral protein p72 . Biochemical data also suggest that protein p72 is assembled in a time-dependent fashion into large membrane-bound complexes that may correspond to capsid-like structures (Cobbold and Wileman, 1998) . Concomitantly, the core shell is formed underneath the viral envelope, and subsequently the viral DNA and nucleoproteins are packaged and condensed to form the electrondense nucleoid (Andres et al., 1997 (Andres et al., , 2002 Brookes et al., 1998) . Intracellular mature virions made at the assembly sites are infectious (Andres et al., 2001) . A fraction of them, however are transported by microtubule-mediated transport (Alonso et al., 2001; de Matos and Carvalho, 1993) to the plasma membrane, where they are released by budding (Breese and Pan, 1978) to give rise to the infectious extracellular enveloped virions.",

            "text": "Because of the high viscosity of the cytoplasm, movement of ASFV particles by diffusion is likely to be very limited (for review see (Luby-Phelps, 2000) . Some viruses overcome this obstacle by hijacking cytoplasmic motors to utilize the cellular cytoskeleton as a roadway. For instance, herpes simplex virus HSV-1, adenovirus, ASFV and rabies virus are thought to use dynein motors to travel along microtubule network for intracellular transport (Alonso et al., 2001; Raux et al., 2000; Sodeik et al., 1997; Suomalainen et al., 1999) . ASFV interacts with the dynein motor complex through the structural virus protein p54 (Alonso et al., 2001) . To further characterize the intracellular trafficking of some of these viruses, several fluorescence-based methods have been developed allowing the detection and characterization of intracellular complexes of viral origin. Importantly, several of these labeling methods allow the visualization of individual virions in living cells (Smith and Enquist, 2002) . These studies suggest that the intracellular trafficking of these viruses is a highly ordered process using cellular motor pathways. Similarly, with tagged viruses it would be possible to visualize virus morphogenesis and cytopathic effects produced in the cells as infection progresses.",

Interestingly, this virus is fully viable and exhibits growth kinetics similar to those of its parental virus. Moreover, p54-EGFP is incorporated into the virus particle with the same efficiency as p54. The presence of p54-EGFP in the virion results in fluorescent particles which are readily visualized with a fluorescence microscope, allowing visualization of p54-EGFP within live cells. As a consequence of such sensitive detection of p54-EGFP throughout infection, we have been able to use time lapse confocal microscopy to monitor the trafficking of p54-EGFP within individual cells. We present those results as subsequent images and time lapse animations. Thus, we have generated a reagent which will enable the visualization of several aspects of ASFV infection in live cells, including virus entry, assembly, trafficking and apoptotic cell death.",

We selected the ASFV envelope protein p54, encoded by the essential E183L gene (Rodriguez et al., 1994) , to drive the EGFP incorporation into the virus envelope. Then, we replaced the protein p54 in the virus particle by p54-EGFP fusion chimera in two steps. First, we introduced in the TK gene of the virus the sequence encoding the fusion protein p54-EGFP under the control of p54 promoter (Fig. 1a) . Recombinant virus plaques exhibiting green fluorescence were picked and individual recombinant viruses were further plaque purified by limiting dilution and screened by PCR and Southern blot to confirm the presence of the p54-EGFP coding sequence in the TK locus, as expected (Fig. 1b) . The recombinant virus obtained was designated as B54GFP-1 and used to infect cells to visualize the fluorescence properties of individual virus clones (Figs. 1c and d). Moreover, the use of EGFP as marker gene allowed a faster detection of recombinant viral plaques when compared to wild-type virus (data not shown). EGFP fusion to a specific protein often modifies its inherent properties, so we first determined whether the addition of EGFP to the C-terminus of p54 could affect the usual subcellular distribution of this protein. Then, Vero cells were infected with B54GFP-1 or wild-type virus (BA71V) and subcellular distributions of p54-EGFP and p54 were examined by conventional immunofluorescence microscopy (Figs. 1e-j). No differences were observed when compared, demonstrating that typical perinuclear accumulation described for p54 in ASFV infection was not altered by the GFP fusion.",

Resulting recombinant virus plaques exhibiting \u03b2-gal activity were picked and analyzed by PCR as well as Southern blot to confirm the interruption of gene E183L in the genome of ASFV (Fig. 1b) . After isolation by several rounds of plaque purification, all virus plaques exhibited both GFP and \u03b2-galactosidase activities. The double recombinant virus finally obtained was designated B54GFP-2 and when used to infect cells, no trace of the wild-type p54 protein could be detected by Western blot in cell extracts obtained at different times of infection using a specific anti-p54 serum (Fig. 3a) .

No reactivity of anti-GFP antibody with BA71V purified virus was found, while a 51-kDa band corresponding to the expected size of p54-EGFP protein was detected in B54GFP-2 purified virus. However, when an anti-p54 serum was probed, a 25-kDa band appeared with BA71V virus and with anti-GFP serum, a 51-kDa band was only reactive with the recombinant virus, demonstrating the incorporation of p54-EGFP fusion protein into the virus particles. The typical doublet detected with anti-p54 serum in BA71V samples was not present in those from B54GFP-2 when detection of p54-EGFP was carried out with monoclonal antibody anti-GFP. It is noteworthy that the levels of p54-EGFP and p54 incorporated into their respective particles were apparently equivalent, since the amount of total virus protein loaded in SDS-PAGE was similar in both cases, as judged by Coomasie blue staining. In order to further confirm this, we analyzed by Western blotting the presence of major structural ASFV protein p72 in these highly purified virions (Fig. 2a) . The proportion of p54-EGFP relative to p72 in B54GFP-2 virions was roughly the same as p54/p72 rate inBA71V virions, indicating that the fusion protein was incorporated to virus particle at similar rates than p54.",

Monolayers of Vero cells were infected with BA71V or B54GFP-2 at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 5 pfu/cell and harvested at different postinfection times. Total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, and the kinetics of synthesis of virus proteins were assessed (Fig. 3a ). Western blotting with an anti-p54 serum allowed the identification of a 51-kDa band, the expected size for p54-EGFP, only in B54GFP-2 infected cell extracts from 8 to 24 hpi. At the same times postinfection, p54 was detected as a doublet in BA71V infected cell extracts while a single 51 kDa band was detected with a monoclonal antibody against GFP, only in recombinant virus infected cell extracts at these time points. p54-EGFP apparently remained intact throughout the course of the infection and sample preparation, since no doublet was observed in WB. As expected, fusion protein was synthesized late after infection (detectable from 8 hpi by WB), in contrast to the early protein p30 used as a control, which was detected from 4 hpi. To demonstrate that p54-EGFP is synthesized during the late viral expression phase under the control of p54 promoter, we examined the synthesis of fusion protein in the presence and absence of a DNA replication inhibitor, such as cytosine \u03b2arabinofuranoside (Ara-C). In the presence of Ara-C, we could detect neither p54-EGFP nor p54 with anti-p54 serum, while early ASFV protein p30 expression was confirmed by WB with a monoclonal antibody against p30 in the presence and absence of inhibitor (Fig. 3b) .",

To assess the rate of virus assembly and egress throughout several infection cell cycles, growth curves were carried out for both B54GFP-2 and the BA71V virus. Vero cells were infected at a multiplicity of 0.1 pfu/cell and harvested every 10 h for 72 h, and both extracellular and intracellular virus yields were calculated for both viruses.

The abundant incorporation of p54-EGFP into ASFV particles indicated that it should be possible to visualize the intracellular movement of virions in real time by laser-scanning confocal microscopy of live cells. Approximately 50% confluent Vero cells were infected with more than 10 PFU of B54GFP-2 virus per cell. Virus infection was synchronized by incubation of cells at 4\u00b0C for 90 min and images were collected, after incubation at 37\u00b0C for nearly 2 h, to analyze the first steps of infection at high magnification. Individual virus particles were readily observed and images were acquired with the confocal microscope setup at a rate of 1 frame/3s for a maximum of 2 min. With this short interval of time, we discerned that intracellular movement in the proximity of perinuclear areas was composed of frequent stops and starts, and often without any apparent direction. Fig. 5 shows an example of this intermittent or saltatory movement of an individual virion. Over the times and distances measured in following frames acquired from 10 different virions, an average speed ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 \u03bcm/s at this stage of infection was calculated. In order to test the role of microtubules at this stage of infection, disruption of microtubules with 10 \u03bcM nocodazole was achieved prior to infection with B54GFP-2.

The protein was mainly localized as small, cytoplasmic and fluorescent aggregates around the nucleus (2 or 3 spots were usually observed within single cell). From this point, all of these perinuclear spots finally aggregated along the next 2 h to give rise to a unique brilliant spot close to the nucleus (Fig. 6b ). This accumulation of p54-EGFP, which was previously shown coincident to the viral factory, gradually increased in size and fluorescence intensity as infection proceeded. It should be mentioned that aggregation of initial perinuclear spots of p54-EGFP could not be observed in every infected cell, but in most of them, probably due to changes in the optical section acquired during the monitoring of the infection. At late times postinfection, in most of the cells, it was usually to observe violent changes in viral factories location (Fig. 6a) , however these changes seem to correspond to movements of infected cell prior to detachment from the dish, while factory location is conserved.",

            "text": "Such tagged virus will enable live analysis of various stages in the ASFV replicative cycle using confocal microscopy. One of these potential applications of B54GFP-2, shown in present work, would be the analysis of intracellular movements of fluorescent particles during the initial phase of infection immediately after internalization into the host cell. When collecting confocal microscopic images every 3 s, from 2 hpi, it was found that most of the viral particles exhibited a special kind of movement defined as saltatory, intermittent and apparently disorganized, making difficult the estimation of Fig. 7 . Live-cell analysis of the last stages of B54GFP-2 infection. Series of EGFP and transmitted light simultaneous acquisitions of the same B54GFP-2 infected Vero cell by confocal microscopy from 10 hpi (when viral factory is already constituted) and every 5 min (see additional file 3 to complete animation sequence). Rounding of the infected cell is followed by membrane blebbing and subsequent formation of p54-EGFP (green) containing vesicles. At 18 hpi, detachment and final cell destruction is observed. Scale bar, 20 \u03bcm. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) speed rates. This type of movement has been described as characteristic of microtubule associated movement. From the analysis of movement of 10 individual virions an average speed ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 \u03bcm/s was calculated with the applied resolution. These data are in agreement with those obtained for other large enveloped viruses. Using fluorescence videomicroscopy, which allows a resolution of 1 frame/s, speed rates from 0.3 to 1 \u03bcm/s have been determined during the late phase of infection with labeled vaccinia virus (Geada et al., 2001; Ward, 2005; Ward and Moss, 2001) . Recently, human cytomegalovirus has been shown to move with apparent velocity of 0.7 to 0.8 \u03bcm/ s (Sampaio et al., 2005) at very early stages in infection. Moreover, HIV virions transport towards host cell nucleus linked to microtubules occurs at 1 \u03bcm/s (McDonald et al., 2002) . The saltatory movements of tagged ASFV virions and the speed rates obtained are consistent with a microtubular based transport (King, 2000) and association of this virus with microtubules has been described (de Matos and Carvalho, 1993) . Previously, we identified the LC8 subunit of cytoplasmic dynein, a minus end directed microtubule-associated motor protein, as an interacting protein with p54 (Alonso et al., 2001) , resulting this interaction critical in the first stages of ASFV infection. Collectively, these data suggested a role for microtubules in the intracellular transport of ASFV after internalization. This role is supported by data showing that nocodazole disruption of microtubules prior to infection results in stop of virion movement and lack of perinuclear accumulation of viral particles at 4 hpi that remained dispersed in the cytoplasm. Also, there was no subsequent constitution of the characteristic virus factory and finally a reduction in ASFV progeny was found (additional files 1 and 2 and Alonso et al., 2001) . Also, during the late phase of ASFV infection, transport of newly assembled virions from viral factory to cell periphery along microtubules has been recently demonstrated (Stefanovic et al., 2005) , similar to the exit transport described for vaccinia virus (Carter et al., 2003) . Further live studies involving labeled B54GFP-2 that are now in course will provide useful and detailed information to clarify the whole ASFV penetration and egress process into the host cell. P54 has been previously described to localize in membrane structures within the virus factories and in immature ASF virions, as judged by immunogold electron microscopy (Rodriguez et al., 1994) . P54-EGFP, just as p54, showed an intracellular distribution fully coincident with ASFV factory at late postinfection times. This allowed us, to follow the viral factory formation process in live cells throughout the infection cycle for first time. Animations obtained show that p54-EGFP was first detected in cytoplasm as several discrete and bright spots representing initial viral assembly sites. As infection progresses these initial assembly sites migrated to a perinuclear area, fused and finally formed a single large accumulation of p54-EGFP per cell. Similar assembly sites were previously described as viral antigens inclusions containing viral precursors which remained tightly associated to microtubules (Carvalho et al., 1988) . Indeed, microtubule associated motors are required to transport these initial assembly sites towards the microtubule organization center (MTOC), where final ASFV factory is constituted (Alonso et al., 2001; Heath et al., 2001) following viral replication and viral assembly takes place. First steps in ASFV assembly consist in the modification of ER membranes Rouiller et al., 1998) . Protein p54 has been involved in the recruitment to the viral factories and transformation of the ER-derived envelope precursors that are finally acquired by virions (Rodriguez et al., 2004) . This new role for p54 in morphogenesis supports the selection of p54 as viral fusion protein and suggests that studies about p54-EGFP trafficking during infection in live cells would be helpful to analyze the acquisition of ASFV envelopes from ER during virus assembly.",

Our results, obtained with live ASFV infected cells have confirmed these previous observations in fixed cells (Hernaez et al., 2004a; Rojo et al., 1998) , which showed that ASFV infection induce the migration of mitochondria to the perinuclear assembly sites, producing the clustering of this actively respiring organelle around viral factory.

This process started at 12 hpi and usually lasted about 6 h, being identical to apoptotic cell death, which has been demonstrated to play a relevant role in ASFV pathogenesis (Hernaez et al., 2004a (Hernaez et al., , 2004b Ramiro-Ibanez et al., 1996) . In live cells, it was possible to observe host cell membrane blebbing, resulting in the formation of p54-EGFP containing vesicles. This finding raised the possibility that these vesicles could contain virus particles. Previous publications reported that the abundant vesicle fraction released in last ASFV infection stages contains virus (Carrascosa et al., 1985) . Then, it is conceivable that the fluorescence detected in the vesicles formed at the end of apoptosis (blebbing), could correspond to GFP labeled virus particles. This vesicle formation observed in live cells is rarely observed using common fixation methods, then it is not possible to observe it with the parental unlabeled virus.",

Eight to 16 h after transfection, cells were infected with BA71V at a moi of 0.1 pfu/ cell. When the cytophatic effect was complete (approximately 72 hpi) the cultures were harvested and sonicated. These transfection-infection mixtures were used to infected monolayers of Vero cells seeded onto 100 mm dishes (Nunc) at different dilutions. After 5-6 dpi, the recombinant virus generated was isolated from progeny virus by three rounds of plaque purification on Vero cells, during which recombinant virus plaques were screened for EGFP direct fluorescence. The resulting recombinant virus was named B54GFP-1. Additional second step consisted in the inactivation of the original gene of p54 (E183L) in the B54GFP-1 genome to finally generate the recombinant virus B54GFP-2. The transfection of Vero cells with p\u0394p54 and following infection with B54GFP-1 allowed the insertion of the \u03b2-galactosidase coding sequence downstream of the strong p73 promoter within E183L gene. Isolation of B54GFP-2 was performed as described above, screening recombinant virus plaques for EGFP fluorescence and expression of \u03b2-galactosidase (Gomez-Puertas et al., 1995) .",
