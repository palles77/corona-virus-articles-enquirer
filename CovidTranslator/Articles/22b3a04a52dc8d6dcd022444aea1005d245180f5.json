Supershift and western blot assays have identified these three proteins as mitochondrial HSP70 (mtHSP70), HSP60, and HSP40. A series of coimmunoprecipitation assays have established that these four MHV RNA binding proteins are associated, even in the absence of MHV RNA. However, the presence of a synthetic RNA containing the sequence bound by these four proteins does increase the amount of co-precipitated protein, in particular the amount of HSP60 which is brought down with antibodies directed against HSP40 and mtHSP70. We have provided evidence for the interaction of these four proteins with the 3 end region of MHV RNA in infected cells by a series of immunoprecipitation RT-PCR assays. We believe it is likely that MHV RNA interacts with m-aconitase prior to its import into mitochondria in cooperation with extra-mitochondrial mtHSP70, HSP60, and HSP40.",

Viral proteins are translated from six to seven subgenomic mRNAs as well as from the genome. The virus-specific subgenomic and genomic RNAs make up a 3 -coterminal nested-set [16, 40] and contain a leader sequence of approximately 70 nucleotides (nt) at the 5 end [13, 39] . Coronaviruses perform their entire replication program in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Following uncoating, coronaviruses express the largest known replicase polyproteins, which in turn are proteolytically processed to yield a large number of mature proteins including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [4, 34] . The RdRp, perhaps in association with host proteins, directs the synthesis of negative-sense RNAs from the 3 end of the viral genome.",

            "text": "We have recently demonstrated that m-apo-aconitase is one of the four proteins which bind to the last 42 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) tail of the MHV genome [3 (+)42 protein binding element] as an RNP complex using gel shift/RNase protection and UV-cross-linking assays. In these assays the addition of a RNase T 1 digestion step prior to electrophoresis increases both the resolution and sensitivity of gel shift assays by digesting unbound RNA and RNA nonspecifically bound to protein, and by decreasing the size and apparent heterogeneity of the RNA-protein complexes [14] . The digested RNA runs as a smear with the dye front at the bottom of the gel, with the majority of the digested probe running out of the gel. Three RNA-protein complexes are detected by this assay. The largest complex, complex 1, is typically the most abundant complex detected, with the two faster migrating complexes being produced in variable amounts [28, 48] . In the course of experiments investigating the binding of m-apo-aconitase to the 3 (+)42 protein binding element, we determined that the addition of ATP and purified m-apoaconitase to cytoplasmic lysates increased RNA binding activity (Fig. 1A , compare lanes 1 and 4), in gel shift/RNase protection assays. The formation of the largest complex, complex 1, was most dramatically affected (black arrow, Fig. 1A ). It should be noted that the lysates used in these experiments contain a large amount of m-aconitase, only a small fraction of which is the apo-enzyme which binds MHV RNA [28] . The addition of ATP to the binding reactions in the absence of added m-apo-aconitase produced only a small increase in RNA binding activity (Fig. 1A , lane 2). When ATP was omitted from the binding reaction (Fig. 1A , lane 3) no increase in RNA binding activity was detected in the presence of m-apo-aconitase. These effects were consistently observed in multiple experiments. Substituting BSA for m-apo-aconitase in these binding reactions resulted in no increase in RNA binding activity (data not shown). These finding led us to generate a working hypothesis that the lysate might possess anATPase activity and thatATP hydrolysis generated energy for a conformational change in m-apo-aconitase which resulted in more efficient RNA binding. We therefore analyzed RNA binding activity in the presence of ATP-\u03b3S, a non-cleavable analogue of ATP. The substitution of ATP-\u03b3S for ATP did not stimulate RNA binding activity (Fig. 1A, To further investigate the role of ATP in the RNA binding reaction, we measured the ability of RNA binding reactions containing m-apo-aconitase, ATP, and cytoplasmic lysate to hydrolyze [\u03b3-32 P]ATP, as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Fig. 1B , ATP was hydrolyzed in the complete binding reaction. Only minor amounts of ATPase activity were observed when purified m-apo-aconitase was omitted from the reaction or when it was replaced with BSA. Similar results were obtained in multiple experiments. Thus stimulation of RNA binding activity and ATPase activity were both dependent on the presence of cytoplasmic lysate, m-apo-aconitase, and ATP. ATPase activity was strictly dependent on the presence of MgCl 2 in the reaction buffer, since no activity was detected in the absence of MgCl 2 or in the presence of 20 mM EDTA (not shown). Thus cytoplasmic lysate exhibits a cation dependent ATPase activity characteristic of members of the HSP70 family of chaperones [27] .",

            "text": "We have previously shown by northwestern blotting and affinity chromatography that in addition to m-apo-aconitase, three other proteins with molecular masses of approximately 70, 58, and 40 kDa bind to RNA corresponding to the last 42 nucleotides of the MHV genome [28] . The presence of an ATPase activity in cytoplasmic lysates which was stimulated by the addition of m-apo-aconitase and RNA containing the 3 (+)42 protein binding element, plus the association of HSP70 family members with proteins destined to be imported into mitochondria [10] , suggested to us that the 70 kDa protein might be a member of the HSP70 family. To investigate this possibility we performed a \"supershift\" assay with antibodies to mtHSP70 and HSP/HSC70. These two monoclonal antibodies to related HSP70 family members do not cross-react. The antibody specific for mtHSP70 produced a supershifted RNP complex ( Fig. 2A, lane 4, gray arrow) . Although the amount of the supershifted RNA-protein complex was relatively small, it was quite specific; antibody to the closely related HSP/HSC70 protein failed to produce a supershifted band ( Fig. 2A, lane 3) as did cytoplasmic lysate in the absence of antibody ( Fig. 2A, lane 2) , although both contained RNAprotein complex 1 (indicated by the black arrow). The relatively small fraction of RNA-protein complexes which were supershifted suggests that an excess of mtHSP70 was present in the binding reaction over that which bound to MHV RNA in complex 1. Alternatively, complex 1 might be formed by a heterogeneous population of proteins and only those containing mtHSP70 are supershifted, or the antibody used had a relatively low affinity for mtHSP70. Labeled RNA incubated with antibody to mtHSP70 in the absence of cytoplasmic lysate did not produce any RNA-protein complexes, only small RNase T 1 digestion products were detected (Fig. 2A, lane 1) . Similar experiments were attempted with an antisera to mitochondrial aconitase (kindly provided by Dr. Richard S. Eisenstein, University of Wisconsin, Madison) but were unsuccessful due to large amounts of ribonuclease present in this rabbit polyclonal antisera (data not shown). Identical experiments using a labeled RNA containing an 11 nucleotide mutation known to interfere with formation of the RNA-protein complex [47] , as expected, failed to contain either the shifted or supershifted complexes (not shown).",

This suggested to us the possibility that the 40 kDa MHV 3 (+)42 binding protein could be HSP40. To investigate this hypothesis we performed a \"supershift\" assay with an antibody to HSP40. As shown in Fig. 2C , preincubation of crude post-mitochondrial lysate with anti-HSP40 antibody prior to our standard RNase protection/gel mobility shift assay resulted in the presence of two additional slowly migrating protected RNP complexes (lane 3) compared to our standard assay (lane 1). The result of the supershift assay suggested that the 40 kDa protein we had observed upon UV-crosslinking was HSP40. The finding that two of three RNA binding proteins which we had identified were HSP family members suggested to us that the 58 kDa protein might be HSP60. A supershift assay with anti-HSP60 produced a supershifted band, as shown in Fig. 2C , lane 4, confirming our suspicion that the 58 kDa protein was HSP60. The finding that antibodies to HSP40 and HSP60 only supershifted a relatively small portion of RNA-protein complex 1 suggests that for these two chaperones, only a small fraction of these molecules participated in the formation of MHV RNA-protein complexes. Alternatively, complex 1 might be formed by a heterogeneous population of proteins and only those containing HSP40 or HSP60 are supershifted, or the antibodies used had relatively low affinities.",

Immunoprecipitation with anti-HSP40 pulled down four proteins 42 protein binding element were partially purified and then subjected to affinity purification with a biotinylated RNA immobilized on magnetic beads as described in Materials and methods. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 1\u00d7 SDS-PAGE loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE (4-20% gradient gel), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with either anti-mtHSP70 antibody (1) or with anti-HSP40 antibody (2) . The positions of molecular weight markers are indicated. B Post-mitochondrial lysates were incubated with 5 ng of 32 P-labeled MHV 3 (+)42 RNA for 20 min at 22 \u2022 C and digested with limiting amounts of RNase T1 as described previously [48] . The RNA-protein complexes formed were irradiated with UV light for 30 min. The samples were digested with RNase A (20 \u00b5g/\u00b5l) and directly immunoprecipitated with anti-mtHSP70 (1) or irrelevant antibody (2) (Fig. 3B,  lane 3) . A parallel immunoprecipitation reaction with anti-mtHSP70 antibody produced the identical result (Fig. 2B, lane 1 ). An irrelevant control polyclonal rabbit antibody (Fig. 3B, lane 2) failed to precipitate any labeled proteins.A control immunoprecipitation reaction with a monoclonal antibody to the HSP/HSC70 mtHSP70, HSP60 and HSP40 bind to the MHV 3 -UTR 103 (cytoplasmic) protein also failed to precipitate any labeled proteins (not shown). Immunoprecipitation of UV-cross linked RNP complexes with anti-HSP60 also pulled down all four proteins, although the signals were weak even after 7 days of exposure (Fig. 3B, lane 4) as opposed to a one day exposure for the other immunoprecipitation experiments. The immunoprecipitation reactions were all performed after treating the RNA-protein complex with RNase. The finding that each of these antibodies pulled down the same four proteins after extensive RNase A digestion suggests that these four proteins bound to the MHV 3 (+) 42 containing RNA as a complex rather than as four proteins binding to different regions on this RNA. This data is consistent with our previous glutaraldehyde crosslinking experiments which suggested that there were protein:protein interactions amongst all four proteins (90, 70, 58 and 40 kDa) which made up RNP complex 1 [28] .",

In order to clarify the situation we immunoprecipitated RNP complexes formed in UV-crosslinking reactions using unlabeled RNA containing the MHV 3 (+)42 protein binding element. These immunoprecipitates were compared to immunoprecipitates prepared in parallel from partially purified cytoplasmic lysate in the absence of RNA. Both sets of immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. When we used anti-mtHSP70 or anti-HSP60 to pull down the RNP complex or lysate in the absence of added RNA, and blotted the immunoprecipitated material separated by SDS-PAGE with anti-HSP40, HSP40 could be detected in both the cases, whereas samples immunoprecipitated with non-specific antibody did not contain HSP40 (Fig. 4A) . However, the signal for HSP40 in immunoprecipitates with anti-HSP60 was considerably augmented by the addition of RNA. When the immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with anti-mtHSP70, anti-HSP60, or anti-HSP40, and the immunoprecipitated materials were blotted and probed with anti-m-aconitase, m-aconitase was detected irrespective of the presence of RNA, but was not detected in immunoprecipitates with non-specific antibody (Fig. 4B) . However, the signals for m-aconitase were greatly increased by the presence of RNA in the immunoprecipitation reactions with anti-HSP40 and anti-HSP60. Thus the association of HSP40 with HSP60 and with m-aconitase is stimulated by the presence of MHV (+)42 containing RNA. These data suggest that these proteins are recruited to an RNA-protein complex.",

PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel mtHSP70, HSP60 and HSP40 bind to the MHV 3 -UTR 105 were immunoprecipitated from post-mitochondrial lysates prepared from mock infected and MHV-JHM infected 17Cl-1 cells with various monoclonal antibodies and amplified by RT-PCR with primers directed against the 3 untranslated region of the MHV genome. A monoclonal antibody to the MHV nucleocapsid (N) protein, a protein which is known to bind to MHV RNAs, was used as a positive control. Antibodies to mtHSP70, HSP40, and HSP60 all co-precipitated MHV RNA which could be amplified by RT-PCR (Fig. 5A, lanes 8-10) . The assay appeared to be specific in that monoclonal antibodies to irrelevant antigens (lanes 4 and 5) did not bring down complexes containing MHV RNA. To further investigate the specificity of this assay we performed a second set of immunoprecipitation reactions and attempted to detect mRNA for the highly expressed house keeping gene GAPDH as well as for MHV specific RNAs (Fig. 5B ). Antibodies to mtHSP70, HSP60, and HSP40 captured MHV RNA (lanes 4, 6, 8) , but failed to precipitate GAPDH mRNA (lanes 5, 7, 9) . The relative amount of MHV RNA captured by the three anti-HSP antibodies in this experiment correlates well with the immunoprecipitation UV-crosslinking experiment shown in Fig. 3B . Thus we have now demonstrated that mtHSP70, HSP60, and HSP40 bind to MHV RNAs present in infected cells.",

In this study, we have used supershift assays and western blot assays of RNA affinity purified protein to identify the three additional components of this RNA-protein complex as mtHSP70, HSP60, and HSP40.

However mtHSP70 has been documented to be present in extra-mitochondrial locations by biochemical fractionation, immunofluorescent labeling and confocal microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy [32, 35, 38] . This protein is also known as a glucose response protein (GRP75); a senescencerelated gene product, mortalin; and as a peptide binding protein, PBP74. This compendium of names reflects the different intracellular compartments and functions which have been described for this protein in addition to its role in refolding and import of mitochondrial proteins. Mammalian HSP40s have a predominantly cytoplasmic distribution in the cell [31] . Although the functional HSP60 complex is predominantly localized to mitochondria in eukaryotes [8] , detailed immunoelectron microscopy studies in a wide variety of cells and tissues show that 15-20% of HSP60 immunoreactivity is present at discrete extra-mitochondrial sites, including unidentified cytoplasmic vesicles [8, 37, 38] and secretory granules [45] . MHV replicates in the cytoplasm, making it unlikely that MHV interacts with these proteins inside mitochondria. We believe that it is most likely that MHV RNA interacts with m-aconitase prior to its import into mitochondria in cooperation with extra-mitochondrial mtHSP70, HSP60, and HSP40. The alternative scenario which would allow this interaction to occur, requires export of at least m-aconitase from mitochondria.",

The folding of most newly synthesized proteins in the cell requires the interaction of a variety mtHSP70, HSP60 and HSP40 bind to the MHV 3 -UTR 107 of protein cofactors known as molecular chaperones. These molecules have been identified in most cellular compartments of different organisms, and recognize and bind to nascent polypeptide chains and partially folded intermediates of proteins, preventing their aggregation and misfolding [reviewed in [5] ]. There are several families of chaperones; those most involved in protein folding are the 40-kDa heat shock protein (HSP40; DnaJ), 60-kDa heat shock protein (HSP60; GroEL), and 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70; DnaK) families. HSP70 family members are regulated by HSP40 (DnaJ or its homologs). These essential and ubiquitous partner proteins make up the DnaJ family, with HSP40 (hdj-1) [30] and Hsdj (hdj-2) [29] being the best studied human homologs. They function to increase ATP turnover, facilitate chaperone action, and promote a more stable interaction with protein substrates [17, 25] . The ATPase activity we detected in partially purified lysates during RNA binding reactions is consistent with the known properties of HSP70's ATPase activity. It also suggests the possibility that mtHSP70 is interacting with a DnaJ domain containing partner, such as HSP40 during RNA binding reactions.",

Although m-aconitase, HSP40, and mtHSP70 contain predicted potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, only mtHSP70 has been experimentally demonstrated to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation [6, 26] . Thus mtHSP70 is the protein most likely to be responsible for the supershift we observed with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Immunoprecipitation/western blot assays with anti-mtHSP70 and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies indicate that a portion of the mtHSP70 is tyrosine phosphorylated, at least in mouse fibroblasts which contain MHV 3 (+)42 RNA binding activity (Nanda and Leibowitz, unpublished) . The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation status of many RNA binding proteins plays a major role in terms of their interaction with RNA. Enzymatic treatment of crude lysates with alkaline phosphatases greatly inhibits their RNA binding activity (Nanda and Leibowitz, unpublished) . This marked decrease in RNA binding activity after dephosphorylation of the lysate argues in favor of an important role for mtHSP70 tyrosine phosphorylation in the formation of the RNP complex.",

A series of co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 4) have established that these four proteins are associated, even in the absence of RNA. However, the data clearly indicated that the presence of RNA enhanced the association of HSP60 with HSP40 and with m-aconitase. The addition of RNA also enhanced the association of m-aconitase with HSP40, but did not affect the association of mtHSP70 with HSP40 or m-aconitase. One possible interpretation of these results is that those associations which we observed to be RNA independent are due to the known associations of these proteins with each other (mtHSP70 with m-aconitase, HSP70s with HSP40), whereas the remainder are dependent on RNA and the formation of an RNA-protein complex. Our data do not distinguish between two possibilities, formation of this four protein RNP complex from the separate proteins as opposed to RNA binding to a pre-existing four protein complex. In either case our results clearly indicate that these four proteins form a complex with MHV-JHM 3 (+)42 containing RNA.",

An interaction between HSP40 and the peptide-binding domain of HSP70 also occurs in vitro. Other HSP70 family members have been shown to bind to RNA substrates and may guide the appropriate folding of these RNAs and affect subsequent regulatory processes such as mRNA stability and/or translation [7, 33, 49] . Thus it is quite possible that HSP40 potentiates the activity of mtHSP70 and HSP60, and thus stabilizes the interaction of m-aconitase with the RNA. It is quite interesting that Tomita and colleagues have recently reported that a yeast HSP40 family member, Ydj1p, is involved in forming brome mosaic virus replication complexes active in negative-strand RNA synthesis, and suggested that a chaperone system involving Ydj1p participates in viral replicase folding or assembly into the active replication complex [41] .",

            "text": "Molecular chaperones rarely function alone; rather they function together in complex pathways [9] . In mammalian cells, components of the mitochondria, namely GRP75 (mtHSP70) and HSP58, a homolog of bacterial groEL, were found to associate with each other and transiently interact with newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins [27] . Only a few partnerships between various HSP40s and HSP70s have been elucidated. The most well-studied chaperone partnership is one found in E. coli between DnaK, a chaperone of the HSP70 class, and DnaJ, an HSP40. Both genetic and biochemical evidence indicates a functional partnership between these two chaperones [1, 20, 46] . However, a chaperone complex containing mtHSP70, HSP60 and HSP40 along with m-aconitase has not been reported previously. We have provided evidence for the existence of such a complex and for its interaction with the 3 end region of MHV RNA. The precise functional significance of this interaction for MHV replication is still unclear, although our previous work is consistent with its having an enhancing effect on viral RNA stability [28] . It is clear that a single HSP70 protein may interact with more than one HSP40 family member [31] . Our knowledge of the interactions between the various chaperones themselves, as well as with newly synthesized mtHSP70, HSP60 and HSP40 bind to the MHV 3 -UTR 109 proteins or other chaperone target proteins is incomplete. It will be interesting to see how modulating the expression of these HSPs affects MHV replication.",
