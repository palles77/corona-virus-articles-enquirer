            "text": "It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide, and the mortality and morbidity are often associated with episodes of symptom deterioration termed exacerbations. Furthermore, whereas death rates in other prevalent conditions are falling, mortality from COPD continues to rise. Exacerbations of COPD account for about 1 in 10 emergency medical admissions to the hospital, and the in-hospital mortality is 10%. Exacerbations are consequently responsible for 70% of the direct costs attributable to COPD.",

On average, patients with moderate to severe COPD, typical of those attending secondary care, will have one or two exacerbations requiring additional treatment annually. However, annual exacerbation incidence rates differ greatly among individual patients, and those prone to more frequent exacerbations experience a particular burden of disease (Figure 43-1) . The best determinant of future exacerbation history is past exacerbation frequency, such that some patients appear more intrinsically susceptible and some more resistant to these important events.",

            "text": "The World Health Organization defines COPD as a disease state having a pulmonary component characterized by airflow limitation that is progressive, not fully reversible, and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response to noxious particles or gases. Airway inflammation is even greater at exacerbation, and the assumption has been that this additional inflammation provokes symptoms such as worsening dyspnea and sputum production, through mechanisms relating to airway tone, airway wall edema, and mucus production. The resultant air trapping increases the work of breathing and causes additional impairment to respiratory muscle function. Triggers of increased airway inflammation are therefore the causes of exacerbation, predominantly tracheobronchial infection, with a lesser role for pollutants. However, the effects of increased inflammation at exacerbation require further clarification, because a direct relationship between the clinical severity of the exacerbation and the degree of airway inflammation has never been conclusively demonstrated.",

Recent advances in molecular biology have isolated respiratory viruses and potentially pathogenic bacteria from the airways of most patients during exacerbations (Box 43-1). However, certainly for patients with more severe underlying disease, bacteria also are often present in the stable state (bacterial colonization). Therefore the presence of an organism at exacerbation does not assume a role in causing that exacerbation. More recent studies suggest that a change in the colonizing bacterial strain may be the precipitating cause. However, not all strain changes are associated with exacerbation, and vice versa. Reflecting this, as discussed later, antibiotics are not of universal benefit during exacerbations. Rhinovirus is the most often identified viral pathogen, and thus exacerbations are more common during the winter months, when viral circulation in the community is higher. The role of atypical organisms such as Chlamydia and Mycoplasma species appears minimal.",

A typical chest radiograph at exacerbation (Figure 43-3) should appear much the same as the patient's radiograph in the stable state.

Not many years ago, these events were considered nothing more than \"troublesome\" deteriorations in symptoms without longterm consequence. We now know this is not true, but many unanswered questions remain. We still understand little about how bacterial and viral pathogens interact. More effective antiinflammatory agents are required, and the optimal role of antibiotics in preventing exacerbations remains to be defined. We currently have no effective interventions targeting viral pathogens, especially rhinovirus. Understanding why some patients appear more susceptible to exacerbations could lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches. Also, it is now recognized that COPD is associated with systemic inflammation that may cause considerable cardiovascular comorbidity, and ways to assess and manage this may reduce the number and impact of exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 1941-1947, 1999. superior in the management of hypercapnic respiratory failure. There remains a limited role for doxapram if NIV is not appropriate, as a bridge to NIV, or (with specialist advice) in conjunction with NIV. The use of doxapram is often limited by side-effects, especially agitation, and any potential benefits do not appear to persist beyond 48 hours. Although intravenous magnesium may be an effective bronchodilator in exacerbations of asthma, no convincing data are available in COPD, and routine use is not recommended. Heliox (helium and oxygen) has a lower viscosity than air and may therefore reduce the work of breathing. However, there remains no evidence of benefit at exacerbation of COPD.",

Combination therapy with LABAs and ICS appears superior to the use of either alone.
