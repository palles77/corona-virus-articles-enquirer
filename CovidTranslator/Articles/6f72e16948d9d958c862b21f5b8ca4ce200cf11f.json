Low wind velocity environment can lead to uncomfortable outdoor thermal experience in hot and humid summer, and it is unable to remove the pollutants out of city canyons. However, the average wind velocity at pedestrian level is significantly lowered by closely spaced tall buildings in modern megacities. To improve the low wind velocity environment at pedestrian level in high-density cities, a general framework and detailed guidelines are needed. This study is the first time to develop such a framework, and provide detailed guidelines for improving pedestrian level low wind velocity environment in high-density cities. Additionally, a detailed review and summarisation of evaluation criteria and improvement measures are presented in this paper, which provide additional options for urban planners. To investigate the performance of the framework, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus was utilised as a case study. Results showed that pedestrian level wind comfort was greatly improved with the developed framework. The outcomes of this study can assist city planners to improve the low wind velocity environment, and can help policy makers to establish sustainable urban planning policies.",

In particular, outdoor human comfort is extremely important in city planning because it can not only improve the physical and mental health of city residents, but also can help reduce power consumption in residential buildings (Amindeldar, Heidari, & Khalili, 2017; Chatzidimitriou & Yannas, 2016; Elnabawi, Hamza, & Dudek, 2016; Kong et al., 2017; Li, Huang, Wu, & Xu, 2018) . Actually, an enjoyable outdoor thermal comfort can encourage city residents to spend more time in outdoor spaces (Chen & Ng, 2012; Du, Mak, Huang, & Niu, 2017) . However, congested airflow at the pedestrian level has become a major concern in the high-density cities because it is the driving force for the transfer of pollutant, heat, and water vapour (Ai & Mak, 2015; Chatzidimitriou & Yannas, 2017; Ignatius, Wong, & Jusuf, 2015) . This problem is more serious in densely built cities at low or mid latitudes, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, which suffer from urban heat island and global warming Kong et al., 2017; Ng, 2009; O'Malley, Piroozfar, Farr, & Pomponi, 2015; Yang, Wong, & Jusuf, 2013 ). Therefore, improving pedestrian level wind environment in high-density cities has become a pressing issue for the establishment of comfortable, healthy, and sustainable cities.",

            "text": "A strong relationship between low wind velocity environments at pedestrian level and unfavourable outdoor living environments has been widely identified in high-density cities (Ignatius et al., 2015) . For sub-tropical and densely built cities, such as Hong Kong, the wind speed and radiant temperature are the most influencing factors of pedestrian thermal comfort in hot and humid summers . In particular, Cheng, Ng, Chan, and Givoni (2012) reported that even in shaded environments, the thermal sensation of respondents was not neutral when wind velocity was below 0.9 m/s during the hot and humid summer of Hong Kong. The cooling effect of wind flow can contribute to the reduction of heat stress in urban cities (Memon, Leung, & Liu, 2010; Priyadarsini, Hien, & Wai David, 2008; Yang & Li, 2011) . It was identified that a wind speed of 1 m/s to 1.5 m/s could lower the air temperature by nearly 2\u00b0C (Erell, Pearlmutter, & Williamson, 2012) . Thus, low wind velocity environment has a negative effect on outdoor thermal comfort, particularly in hot and humid summers. In addition, the dispersion and dilution of airborne pollutants in the urban environment depend strongly on wind flow because it can help remove pollutants to external surroundings (Ai & Mak, 2014a ,b, 2016 Hang & Li, 2011; Kim & Baik, 2004; N'riain, Fisher, Martin, & https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2018.08.001 Received 2 May 2018; Received in revised form 31 July 2018; Accepted 1 August 2018 Littler, 1998) . The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong urged the officials and city residents to consider the pollutant dispersion in their living environment (Li, Duan, Yu, & Wong, 2005) . By analysing the results from field measurements, Jones, Fisher, Gonzalez-Flesca, and Sokhi (2000) indicated that traffic pollutants could not be properly dispersed or diluted with weak wind conditions in urban areas. Moreover, low wind velocity environments in the street canyons could not form the coupling process to remove the pollutants from the street canyons to the upper atmosphere (Jones et al., 2000; Vignati, Berkowicz, & Hertel, 1996) .",

Tsang, Kwok, and Hitchcock, (2012) conducted wind tunnel tests to investigate the influence of building dimensions, separations, and podiums on pedestrian level wind environment. Their results indicated that wide buildings with podiums should be discouraged in building designs in high-rise cities, for resulting in large areas of low wind velocity environment around buildings. In the study of Kubota et al. (2008) , the relationship between the gross building coverage ratio and the wind environment at pedestrian level from actual Japanese city was quantitatively studied using wind tunnel tests. The results showed that a small gross coverage ratio should be adopted in city planning because a high gross coverage ratio results in low wind velocity at pedestrian level, especially for the detached houses.

(2015) conducted field measurements in a university campus in Hong Kong, and their findings indicated that local wind amplification could be achieved by utilising an innovative building design (lift-up design). numerically studied the wind environment in idealized high-rise urban areas, and reported that building height variation could improve pedestrian level wind environment. Apart from the above mentioned measures, the Hong Kong government has issued the air ventilation assessment (AVA) scheme to enhance wind flow movement at pedestrian level (Ng, 2009) . Later, new wind comfort criteria were proposed by , which were aimed at assessing wind comfort in low wind velocity environments. However, no general framework that provides detailed application procedure has been presented. Therefore, a general framework that can be applied to improve pedestrian level wind environment is in urgent needed.",

The main purpose of the AVA scheme is to improve wind flow movement at pedestrian level and to assess the influence of newly built developments on the neighbouring wind environment. The principle of the AVA scheme is \"the more, the better\"; and thus only a low wind threshold value was established in this scheme (Ng, 2009 ).

Moreover, the parameters in the new wind comfort criteria were chosen by thoroughly reviewing the existing wind comfort criteria to adapt to low wind conditions.

Du, C.M. Mak Sustainable Cities and Society 42 (2018) 314-324 measurement study in the HKPolyU campus found that wind speed was amplified by the lift-up design in a local precinct . Xia, Liu, Niu, and Kwok, (2015) assessed the influence of the lift-up design on the pedestrian level wind environment using wind tunnel measurement, and found that integrating the lift-up design in existing building configurations can enhance the wind speed around buildings. In a study of Du, Mak, Liu et al. (2017) , the effects of the lift-up design on pedestrian level wind environment in different building configurations, namely the slab shaped building, the corner shaped building, the semi-open shaped building and the close shaped buildings, were quantitatively evaluated using CFD simulation. The results showed that the lift-up design could effectively improve the low wind velocity environment and its enhancement highly relied on the approaching wind direction. Tse et al. (2017) found that the lift-up core dimensions govern the pedestrian level wind speed around an isolated building using wind tunnel measurement, and suggested that proper core dimensions should be selected before implementing the lift-up design in architectural design. Similarly, Du, Mak, and Li (2018) proposed a multi-variable optimization method to determine the appropriate liftup dimensions for an optimum wind environment at pedestrian level using CFD simulation. Liu et al. (2016 Liu et al. ( , 2017 studied the pedestrian level wind environment around isolated buildings with and without the lift-up design using CFD simulation, and found that the lift-up design could improve the wind speed around isolated buildings, but the effects were only limited to the neighbouring area.

Juan, Yang, Wen, Lee, and Wang (2017) optimized the wind environment in real urban streets by manipulating the configurations of the arcade design in CFD simulation.

Their study also suggested that a higher pedestrian level wind velocity could be achieved when the opening was closer to the ground level and when the size of the opening was larger. In a study conducted by Fan et al. (2017) , different types of building openings inside canyons were investigated using CFD simulation. The study concluded that building openings could effectively improve the low wind velocity environment, and considering the values in the development floor area, an opening value of 10% was enough to improve the low wind velocity environment. Moreover, the CFD simulation studies by Hang and Li (2010a) , Hang and Li (2011) indicated that the airflow ventilation rate could be improved significantly when buildings in a compact array were openbased (have openings underneath the building).

Additionally, different ventilation strategies had been proposed for the ventilation system.

(ii) The arcade design and the lift-up design can enhance wind ventilation at pedestrian level directly without sacrificing any land use, but the result of the arcade design is less effective than the lift-up design.

The measured and target values of the wind profiles and their corresponding approaching wind directions are presented in Fig. 6(b) , where the mean wind velocity at the reference height (200 m in prototype) was around 8 m/s. The measured errors were within 5%, which confirmed the confidence in the measurement data. The similarity requirements were strictly examined during the wind tunnel tests, and the blockage ratio was 4.5% with Reynolds Numbers (Re) over \u00d7 7 10 4 . These met the requirements of the quality wind tunnel test standards ASCE (1999) and AWES (2001) manuals). The Kanomax velocity sensors were utilised for the measurements of pedestrian level wind environment, and they were Y. Du, C.M. Mak Sustainable Cities and Society 42 (2018) 314-324 evenly distributed in the campus model. Moreover, the Kanomax velocity sensors were carefully calibrated before the wind tunnel measurements.",

A general design framework was developed, and detailed guidelines on improving the pedestrian level low wind velocity environment in high-density cities were offered. The general design framework was presented in the form of a flowchart, which was systematic and effective. Evaluation criteria that aim to improve the low wind velocity environment were also reviewed in detail, namely the AVA scheme, the new wind comfort criteria for Hong Kong, and city ventilation parameters. Moreover, the strategies used to improve low wind velocity environments were reviewed in detail, including the lift-up design, the arcade design, the building opening, building disposition, and the active pedestrian ventilation system.",

Wind tunnel tests were conducted to obtain the pedestrian level wind environment in the campus model. The choice of the evaluation criteria were chosen based on the review results presented in Section 3, and the new wind comfort criteria were selected. The wind comfort of the campus model was improved by vigorously following the proposed design framework, and the improvement measures were chosen based on the review results presented in Section 4. Specifically, three distinctive cases were examined, namely the campus model without the lift-up design, the campus model with the lift-up design, and the campus model with an opening in building Y. Results showed that the proposed design framework could help in improve the low wind velocity environment at pedestrian level. This study mainly focused on improving congested wind flow caused by tall and dense building arrays. The design framework and guidelines described in this paper were established under the presumption that low wind velocity environments have resulted in serious issues for urban residents. However, this design framework can also be applied to other wind environments, such as strong wind conditions in sparsely populated cities. This can be achieved by replacing the improvement measures and evaluation criteria with the current measures and criteria. Moreover, this study indicated that favourable wind environments in local precincts could be achieved by integrating innovative building designs.",

In particular, the evaluation criteria and the improvement measures reviewed in this study can be used in practical developments. For example, the lift-up design could be used to improve the pedestrian level wind environment for an existing urban area. These findings can help urban planners and policy makers improve low wind velocity environments at pedestrian level, and build a sustainable city.",
