During the initial spreading of the virus in China, we demonstrated the ensemble Kalman filter performed well as a short-term predictor of the daily cases reported in Wuhan City. Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province at its early stage and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemic trajectories, compared to those obtained with Markov processes. Since recent studies show that COVID-19 epidemiological parameters do not follow exponential distributions leading to Markov processes, future works need to focus on non-Markovian models to better capture the COVID-19 spreading trajectories. In addition, shortening the infectious period via early case identification and isolation can slow the epidemic spreading significantly.",

Third, we simulate the epidemic spreading in Wuhan City incorporating non-Markovian processes, i.e., non-exponential parameter distributions, and compare the predicted epidemic trajectories obtained from Markov processes.",

However, an overwhelming majority of the epidemic models have considered Markov processes, in which the transition between compartments follows an exponential distribution. To the best of the authors' knowledge, very few works have been done incorporating non-Markovian processes to epidemic models with respect to COVID-19. In this section, we take Wuhan City as a study area and try to demonstrate how distributions of key epidemiological factors can influence the predicted trajectory of the disease spreading.",

Fig. 1 shows the distributions of the predicted numbers of COVID-19 cases based on data 1, 2 and 3 days before. The results of the EnKF prediction give two rangesthe weak one from minimum to maximum (the solid black line) which can include all the reported real data (the green circle); the stronger one from the lower quartile to the upper quartile (the blue box) which also covers most of the real numbers. The red line inside the box indicates the median of the samples. We can see that most medians are very close to the corresponding real numbers. Taking the median as our predicted number gives the relative error shown in Fig. 1(d) . The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for 1-day-ahead prediction is 0.19%; the MAPE for 2-day-ahead prediction is 0.32%; the one for 3-day-ahead is 0.62%. The performance of 1-day-ahead prediction is the best and the one of 3-day-ahead is the worst. When n-day-ahead prediction is conducted, the results from (n-1)-day-ahead is used, so the errors will accumulate.",

The self-quarantine policy was carried out on January 23 rd in Wuhan and a series of administrative actions were taken to prevent the disease from spreading. Considering that there are several days delay from the infection to detection, the estimated \u03b2 matches with the real situation. On February 12 th , because Wuhan authorities changed the case definition to include symptomatic patients in addition to tested ones, there was a huge increase in cases, which results in a huge increase in estimated infection rate \u03b2 as well. Therefore, the estimated \u03b2 on February 12 th is inaccurate. After February 14 th , the infection rate \u03b2 is less than the removing rate \u03b3, which means the epidemic had peaked in Wuhan.",

More specifically, the epidemic curve with non-Markovian processes is flattened with a smaller epidemic peak compared with that from Markov processes. This is because the infectious period used in the Markovian model has an exponential distribution (mean =3.9 days) similar to the shape of the exponential distribution (mean=4.0 days) in Fig. 6 (a) , but shorter than the lognormal distribution (mean=3.9 days, median=1.5 days) used after January 18 th . The reasons above indicate that control measures to reduce the infectious period can effectively mitigate the outbreak.",

Instead of taking mean values derived from clinical studies as input to the epidemic models, researchers need to take into account the empirically derived distribution of the parameters.",

Since most current network-based approaches are based on Markov processes, in which epidemiological parameters are assumed to follow exponential distributions, non-Markovian process-based models need to be further explored to better predict the COVID-19 spreading. Our results show that reducing the infectious period via measures such as early case identification and isolation can reduce the epidemic size significantly.",

Our simulation results indicate that the containment of this highly contagious disease was achieved by stringent control measures by the Chinese government. Without continued and aggressive control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province would have become persistent. If the infection rate is reduced through the enhanced protective measures by 25%, the epidemic would reach the peak in mid-February and fade out in late September. Reducing the average node degree inside each city via social distancing measures, the number of infectious cases would peak at mid-February and decrease to zero at mid-June. Only with combined implementation of enhanced protective measures and social distancing measures, the epidemic dynamics would peak at around mid-February and approximate the actual epidemic trajectory in March. This can be an important message for countries going through the exponential growth of the epidemic in the current days.",
