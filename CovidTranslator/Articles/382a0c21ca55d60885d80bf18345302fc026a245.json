            "text": "The ability of veterinarians to obtain blood types of potential donors and recipients is limited by the scarcity of reagents and laboratories that perform typing of animal blood. At this time, canine typing reagents are avaiable only through the laboratory of Dr. Robert Bull at Michigan State University. In addition, several veterinary schools and at least one commercial laboratory (Stormont Laboratories, Vacaville, California) perform typing of canine blood using these reagents. In most cases canine donors are typed only for the two alleles at the DEA-1 locus with antibodies combined and termed DEA-1.1,2. (For procedures for typing and cross matching, see Smith, this volume [\"Erythrocytes\"].) Dogs that react with this reagent are commonly called A positive. Red cells that are A positive are most likely to sensitize recipients that lack these antigens. Because A-positive dogs represent 60% of the population, they can be utilized as donors for recipients that are also positive. This requires that typing be available for recipients. Blood group A 2 dogs may develop antibodies when given Ai red cells, but this is rare (Swisher and Young, 1961) . These antibodies would be detectable if a major cross match were done before subsequent transfusions. Although a single transfusion of A-positive blood could be given to an A-negative dog never previously transfused, antibodies may be formed that increase the risk for reaction on subsequent transfusion, for premature destruction of transfused cells 7-14 days after the first transfusion, and for neonatal hemolytic disease in pups of transfused bitches (see Paradis, this volume). If typing is not immediately available, Anegative donors can be used for all transfusions. Testing for blood group antigen DEA-7, present in 45% of dogs, is not routinely done, but this antigen may also elicit an antibody response in DEA-7 negative dogs (Swisher and Young, 1961) . Some DEA-7-negative dogs have naturally occurring anti-7 antibody. Although this has generally been thought not to be of clinical significance, R. W. Bull (personal communication, 1990) has observed shortened survival of transfused DEA-7-positive cells into these dogs. The remaining antigens are either weakly reactive, or else very prevalent or rare so that donor and recipient are likely to match.",

A major cross match, testing donor red cells against recipient plasma, will detect clinically significant antibodies that have formed after a previous transfusion. The cross match does not prevent sensitization; it only detects sensitization already present. An autocontrol with recipient red cells and plasma is included because some recipients have immune-mediated hemolysis with autoagglutination or direct antiglobulin test (DAT) positivity interfering with both typing and cross matching. If the control is only weakly positive and the test sample is strong, results may be valid. If both are equal, no conclusions as to compatibility can be drawn. A minor cross match testing donor plasma with recipient red cells is not helpful in dogs.",

            "text": "Feline typing reagents are not readily available, although potentially incompatible transfusions are detectable by a major cross match. The frequency of blood groups in cats varies geographically and by breed (Auer and Bell, 1981; Bird et al., 1988; Giger, 1989 Giger, , 1990 . Greater than 99% of cats in the United States, over 90% in Europe and Japan, and approximately 70% in Australia are blood group A. Certain breeds, especially the Persian, Devon rex, British shorthair, Himalayan, Abyssinian, Birman, Scottish fold, and Somali, have a high prevalence of group B, up to 50% in some breeds (Giger, 1990) . The oriental breeds such as Siamese and Burmese tend to be group A. Any feline transfusion across blood groups results in rapid destruction of the transfused cells, even if the recipient has never been previously transfused. The most severe clinical reactions have been seen in the group B cats given group A cells. These cats have high naturally occurring titers of anti-A antibody. Less severe reactions are seen if group B blood is given to a group A cat, but survival of transfused cells is short. A practical approach to feline transfusions is to have group A donors available. Typing is available at the same locations that type canine blood. When a transfusion is needed, a major cross match is done. If the recipient is a group B cat, strong agglutination occurs even without use of Coombs reagent. If group B blood is needed, a group B donor may be identified form one of the high-prevalence breeds. If the need is not urgent, blood may be obtained from Dr. Urs Giger at the University of Pennsylvania.",

            "text": "In horses, compatibility tests including direct agglutination, antiglobulin, and hemolytic testing were not effective in predicting survival of transfused Fe 59 -labeled cells (Kallfelz et al., 1978) . Despite lack of evidence of incompatibility on testing, transfusions were only of value for periods of 2-4 days. Second transfusions in the same group of six horses resulted in two severe anaphylactic reactions. Similar short red cell survival was noted when labeled, cross match-compatible red cells were given to normal cattle (Kallfelz and Whitlock, 1973) . From days 3 to 4 posttransfusion, the surviving fraction dropped from 60 to 24%. In goats and sheep the half-life of transfused autologous red cells was 8 days (Gulliani et al., 1975; Giles et al., 1975) . When unmatched homol-ogous goat red cells were transfused, the survival times were 3-4 days with no cells remaining in the circulation by the seventh day. The most likely explanation for poor survival of transfused red cells in horses and ruminants is the presence of naturally occurring isoantibodies and numerous blood group antigens. Any transfusions in these species must be given with caution because cross matching may not predict incompatibility. Also, because survival of cells is so poor, maximum use of alternatives to transfusions should be made.",

            "text": "In most animals needing a transfusion, the cause of the blood loss or anemia is known. In cases of anemia of unknown cause, blood should be drawn for any tests anticipated before the transfusion is given. The testing should include a complete blood count (CBC) with reticulocyte count (except in horses) and a platelet count. Red cell indices and morphology can be helpful in finding the cause. A DAT is run if there is any suspicion of immune-mediated disease, because a positive DAT posttransfusion could be caused by development of alloantibodies. If iron deficiency is present in an adult animal, one should search especially diligently for a bleeding gastrointestinal lesion such as ulcer or neoplasia. If the anemia is nonregenerative, renal function should be evaluated. Human recombinant erythropoietin has been shown to be an effective treatment for dogs and cats with anemia associated with renal disease (Cowgill et al., 1990) . Examination of the marrow is indicated in cases of nonregenerative anemia of unknown cause. Anemia of chronic disease is associated with a mild decrease in the hematocrit (Hct), and occurs secondary to many chronic or debilitating diseases. If the Hct drops below 20-25%, an additional problem must be sought. Additional information on the clinical workup of the anemic patient is provided elsewhere (Cotter, 1989) .",

            "text": "Red blood cells are needed whenever the red cell number becomes so depleted that oxygen-carrying capacity is insufficient to maintain adequate performance. The definition of adequate may vary. For example, an otherwise healthy animal with mild to moderate weakness after acute blood loss may be allowed to recover spontaneously. A severely ill patient with the same degree of anemia caused by surgical blood loss may recover more quickly with fewer complications if transfused. One must avoid the temptation of arbitrary transfusion at a given Hct. Several factors are considered, including the cause and severity of anemia, expectation of further blood loss, alternative treatment options, and the time of onset of anemia. Typically, anemia caused by lack of red cell production is slow in onset and compensatory mechanisms are functioning by the time the anemia is severe. These mechanisms include increased cardiac output and pulmonary ventilation, and in some species, increased red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). Thus, oxygen delivery is maximized and sedentary patients may show only mild clinical signs despite a Hct of less than 10%. Conversely, the acutely anemic patient may require red cell support at a higher Hct. In fact a patient with acute hemorrhage may die with a normal Hct. The decision to transfuse also depends upon the overall evaluation of the patient, especially cardiac, pulmonary, and renal function. The availability of alternative treatment such as iron replacement after chronic blood loss may avert the need for blood. Ventricular function is depressed in animals when the Hct is less than 30%, however, oxygen extraction and central venous Po 2 remain normal until the Hct reaches 20% (Messmer, 1975) .",

For convenience, fresh whole blood is also used in cats and small dogs less than 5-6 kg. In ambulatory large animal practice, blood may be drawn from one animal in a herd and given immediately to another. Although fresh whole blood may supply some platelets, stored whole blood does not contain viable platelets after 12-24 hours. If equipment and personnel are available to make components, there is no value in storing whole blood. An exception would be in the cat, for which there is a limit to the amount of blood (approximately 50 ml) that can be drawn from a donor. This volume can be collected in a standard human blood bag after citrate is removed by expelling it into a satellite bag. Enough citrate is left in the collection line for 50 ml, but the volume is too small for plasma removal by standard plasma extractors. Presently, the only way that feline PRBCs can be collected is in an open system. Occasionally for treatment of neonatal hemolytic disease, washed maternal red cells may be given. Most of the antibody can be removed with the plasma, allowing for survival of the remaining neonatal red cells along with the transfused maternal cells.",

The process for freezing and preserving dog red cells has been described, but is somewhat expensive and time consuming, so is not practical for routine veterinary use (Contreras et al., 1979) .

Autologous or homol ogous transfused cells can be labeled, with 51 Cr or other isotopes, and persistence in the circulation studied (see Smith, this volume [\"Erythrocytes\"]). Compatible red cells are removed steadily over a period of time up to the normal red cell life span for each species. This is because transfused blood contains cells of all ages. Transfused cells survive and undergo aging changes in the same manner as nontransfused cells. As they become senescent, IgG can be detected on the cell membrane (Garratty, 1987) . The autologous antibody is directed against membrane antigens normally hidden by sialic acid on the surface of the red cell. Antibody-covered red cells are removed by macrophages predominantly in the spleen. It is uncertain whether splenectomy prolongs red cell life span in normal individuals.

After severe hemorrhage, levels of albumin and other serum proteins are decreased. Increased synthesis of albumin begins in approximately 48 hours, so initially preformed albumin moves to circulation from the interstitial space (Malt et al., 1969) . Erythropoietin levels begin to rise within about 6 hours. The Hct falls gradually over 2-3 days after acute blood loss.

It has been said that the controversy over the use of crystalloids or colloids in critically ill patients has an emotional tenor that is inversely proportional to the supporting physiologic data (Shoemaker, 1982) . All agree that the first approach to the acutely bleeding patient is to stop bleeding and restore circulating volume. Most clinicians prefer crystalloid replacement at least initially. Several studies of experimentally induced hemorrhagic shock have reported improved survival when crystalloids were compared to colloids (Collins et al., 1973; Gaisford et al., 1972) . Although smaller volumes of colloids are required they were more likely to cause pulmonary edema because of leakage into the pulmonary tissues (Vergilio et al., 1979) . In a randomized human study and an experimental primate study, colloids were associated with a lower incidence of pulmonary edema (Rackow et al., 1983; Gaisford et al., 1972) . In two additional studies, hemodynamic and oxygen transport responses were greater and more prolonged after infusion of colloids (Nees et al., 1978; Dawidson et al., 1979) . Colloids improved hemodynamic and oxygen transport whereas crystalloids improved arterial pressure and peripheral resistance, but not flow and oxygen transport.",

This represents replacement of one blood volume (Breznock and Strack, 1982) . Adequacy of treatment is determined by overall clinical appearance of the patient, heart and respiratory rates, mucous membrane color, capillary refill time, pulse quality, Hct, and urine output. These are sometimes supplemented by serial measurements of arterial and central venous pressure, and in specialized centers, pulmonary wedge pressure. These parameters do not always correlate well as predictors of survival (Shoemaker et al., 1979 ).

The Hct is monitored as fluid is replaced, but is imprecise because massive hemorrhage can cause death with a minimal drop, and overhydration can lower the Hct leading to a false sense of urgency for red cell replacement. The decision as to whether red cells are needed is based upon a combination of known and estimated blood loss, response to initial fluid resuscitation, Hct, and total serum protein level.",

Historically, physicians and veterinarians have relied upon fresh or stored whole blood to replace losses. On first thought it seems logical that blood loss should be replaced with whole blood, but initial blood replacement should consist of PRBCs. The movement of albumin from the interstitial space to capillaries will replace up to 50% of lost blood volume without the need for supplementary plasma. In addition, PRBCs have less adenine, citrate, sodium, ammonia, histocompatibility antigens, and antibodies than whole blood. Packed red cells are also active in increasing plasma volume. Blood was removed from dogs and equal-volume replacement using PRBCs was given to one group, and plasma was given to the other group. The red cells caused movement of interstitial plasma into the circulation, resulting in an equal increase in plasma volume in both groups (Valeri et al., 1986a) . Valeri and Altschule (1976) described a \"missing blood syndrome\" in soldiers re suscitated with crystalloid, colloid, and blood products. These patients had chronic hypovolemia not detectable by measurement of Hct or blood pressure. Large volumes of transfused red cells were required to raise the plasma volume and reexpand the peripheral circulation.",

The amount of blood to be given depends upon the amount of blood lost and patient's response. An initial dose of 10 ml/kg PRBCs can be given and the patient is then reassessed.

It is common for platelet counts to be increased after moderate hemorrhage. In humans the platelet count generally remains over 100,000/\u03bc1 until after transfusion of 18 units of stored blood, because platelets are not present in either stored whole blood or PRBCs (Counts et al., 1979) . Some of the drop in platelet count that occurs after large volumes of fluids or PRBCs is dilutional. Platelet replacement is indicated only if abnormal bleeding is occurring, not just because the count is low. As fluid shifts reestablish equilibrium, an increase in platelet count and serum proteins occurs. Decreased platelet counts after only moderate hemorrhage and transfusion might indicate the presence of diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) or some other underlying disease.",

There is no advantage of stored whole blood over PRBCs as treatment for acute hemorrhage. A patient who has received a transfusion equivalent of one blood volume will retain approximately 25-30% of his original blood elements. Even without the additional consumption of clotting factors that occurs in hemorrhage, this begins to approach a level at which coagulation becomes impaired (Sohmer and Scott, 1982) . Patients who receive a large volume of PRBCs may develop decreased levels of clotting factors, but the likelihood of severe depletion is low if coagulation was normal before the hemorrhage. In normal individuals, circulating levels of clotting factors are in excess of those needed, and additional extra vascular distribution of most factors is present. Except for factors V, VIII, and fibrinogen, most of the factors are roughly the size of albumin and share its 40% intravascular and 60% extravascular distribution (Counts, 1984) . A pool of factor VIII is bound to vascular endothelium and is released with stress or \u00df-adrenergic stimulation (Wall et aL, 1980) . It is difficult to predict whether replacement of clotting factors will be needed after massive transfusion. Monitoring of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) or at least activated clotting time (ACT) is useful to determine need for, and efficacy of, replacement.",

Hypothermia also interferes with platelet function by inhibiting thromboxane B 2 production, decreases oxygen release in tissues, and interferes with metabolism of citrate (Valeri et aL, 1987) . A reduction in bleeding time correlated well with warming of the patient, indicating that the platelet function defect is reversible. In situations of massive transfusions with stored PRBCs or whole blood, storage lesions such as decreased pH, 2,3-DPG, and ATP may interfere with oxygen delivery and red cell survival. The metabolism of citrate to bicarbonate tends to neutralize the drop in pH. Although 2,3-DPG can be regenerated and other by-products of transfusion cleared, this places an increased burden on the patient, who is not in an ideal position for such demands. The patient undergoing massive transfusion is at greatest risk of suffering adverse effects of a transfusion. A practical outline for management of human patients in hemorrhagic shock has been outlined with crystalloid and colloid infusions followed by PRBCs (Sohmer and Scott, 1982) . Depending upon the PT, APTT, and platelet count, FFP or platelets are added. Occasionally cryoprecipitate may be needed if bleeding continues and fibrinogen levels remain low despite FFP administration. Significant bleeding is not likely unless the PT and APTT are at least 1.5 times that of the control.",

Most dogs with autoagglutination and intravascular hemolysis have IgG plus complement on their red cells (Slappendel, 1979) . The mortality in this form is quite high, 75-80%. Most dogs with IMHA, and almost all with the severe form, require one or more transfusions in addition to immunosuppressant therapy.

These patients may be serologically incompatible with their own red cells and with those of most if not all donors. If they have been previously transfused, they may also have alloantibodies that may be impossible to detect. Sometimes difficulties in typing human patients with positive controls are overcome by incubating the patient's red cells at 45\u00b0C for 5-10 minutes and washing at the same temperature. This may elute the antibody and allow typing to proceed, but must be done cautiously to prevent hemolysis (Petz, 1982) . This procedure has not been evaluated in dogs.

Older animals with adequate stores are more resistant, and iron deficiency usually indicates that chronic blood loss has occurred. Occult blood loss occurs most frequently via the gastrointestinal tract from blood-sucking parasites, ulcers, or tumors. If the cause of the blood loss can be identified and removed, and if the patient is stable, iron replacement may prevent the need for transfusion.

Because the anemia is generally mild, it is often not commented upon. Pathogenesis includes shortened red cell life span by a hyperactive reticuloendothelial system. In addition, mobilization of iron from stores is decreased and the marrow fails to increase production to compensate for the loss. Cats are especially prone to anemia of chronic disease because of their normally short red cell life span and small blood volume to body weight ratio compared to other species (Breznock and Strack, 1982) . In addition, many cats with various illnesses carry retroviruses such as feline leukemia or immunodeficiency viruses, which further suppress the marrow. Anemia of chronic disease usually requires no specific therapy and resolves if the underlying disease is corrected. Severe nonregenerative anemia should not be attributed to anemia of chronic disease, but probably has another cause.",

Although compensatory mechanisms allow these patients to function at a low Hct, periodic transfusion of PRBCs may be required for survival. In contrast to anemia caused by hemolysis or blood loss, anemia from lack of production generally has a poorer prognosis for recovery. Evaluation of bone marrow may provide clues to diagnosis as well as prognosis. If clinical signs of anemia such as tachycardia, tachypnea, and weakness are present at rest, transfusion is indicated. If the patient is asymptomatic, transfusion may be withheld. However, if the Hct drops below 10%, the animal is at significant risk for acute collapse should it become stressed. Because the Hct in animals is rarely raised into the normal range by transfusion, one need not be concerned that the transfusion will further suppress hematopoiesis. Also, because hemosiderosis from iron overload becomes a possibility after multiple transfusions, additional iron supplementation should be avoided. Cross matching becomes progressively more important in animals receiving multiple transfusions because the risk of sensitization is greater. Advances in production and use of genetically engineered hematopoietic growth factors is discussed by Donahue (this volume). Dogs and cats with anemia secondary to chronic renal failure often respond to treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (Cowgill et al., 1990) .",

Tests may change rapidly, and the classic picture of low platelets and fibrinogen, prolonged PT and PTT, and elevated fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) levels may not be present. Whenever the fibrinogen level is decreased below 80-100 mg/dl, the PT and PTT will be prolonged because fibrinogen is needed for fibrin formation in both tests. In one study in dogs, factor V was depleted but factor VIII was not (Feldman et al., 1981) . Although this differs from reports in humans and from experimental studies in dogs, it does not change the approach to treatment (Rabiner and Friedman, 1968) . Thrombocytopenia is so consistent that a diagnosis of DIC cannot be certain without it. The platelet count returns to normal slowly over several days as DIC resolves. The fibrinogen level, however, rapidly returns to normal. FDPs are cleared primarily in the Kupffer cells of the liver and some are excreted in the urine. Elevated FDPs may sometimes be seen in hepatic or renal failure (Westphal, 1984) .

Once a patient is bleeding and fibrinogen is low, and the PT and PTT are prolonged, replacement of clotting factors with FFP is needed in addition to supportive care (Burns, 1987) . Withholding FFP in the presence of significant ongoing hemorrhage is much like the old argument that nutritional support should be withheld from cancer patients because it \"feeds\" the tumor cells. In addition to coagulation factors, FFP contains antithrombin III (AT III), a potent inhibitor of thrombin formation. Replacement of AT III will help prevent further thrombosis. The endogenous production of AT III in dogs was shown to increase rapidly beginning within 6 hours of induction of DIC by endotoxin injection (Tanaka et al., 1986) . Production was able to surpass consumption after 1-2 days despite ongoing DIC. If one can eliminate the underlying cause of DIC and if bleeding is not evident, it is not necessary to \"treat\" the laboratory abnormalities; they can simply be monitored along with the patient. In the most severe cases of DIC with excessive blood loss, replacement of red cells, clotting factors, and plate lets may be needed. Here fresh whole blood is indicated initially with individual components added later as needed. For example, severe depletion of fibrinogen might best be treated with supplementary cryoprecipitate. Heparin is sometimes used in conjunction with FFP and controversy exists as to when and how it should be used. There is general agreement that heparin used alone in the bleeding patient is risky and unlikely to be successful. Heparin is a specific activator of AT III and requires its presence for its anticoagulant effect. If a patient continues to bleed or shows evidence of thrombosis 4 hours after ther apy is begun for the underlying disease and the clotting factors are replaced, then heparin should be added. An exception to this rule would apply in cases in which the risk of development of DIC is very high. For example, dogs with severe heat stroke frequently develop DIC and might benefit from prophylactic heparin when thrombosis is beginning and coagulation defects are not yet measurable.",

In general, smaller doses are pre ferred (Westphal, 1984) . Despite the controversy, heparin has never been shown to increase survival in Gram-negative sepsis or other states in which DIC is encountered (Corrigan and Jordan, 1970) . Harker (1974) argued that heparin aggravates bleeding and the resulting rise in fibrinogen level reflects defective fibrin stabilization, not improved hemostasis. Some have advocated incubating heparin with FFP before administering to activate antithrombin III to help prevent further thrombosis (Ruehl etal., 1982) . Other therapeutic agents such as inhib itors of fibrinolysis (\u03b5-aminocaproic acid) and steroids are not likely to help and may be dangerous. Steroids slow the clearance of FDPs, bac teria, and immune complexes, but may be indicated in spetic shock from Gram-negative bacteria. Antithrombin III concentrates have recently been used with some success in human patients, but are not available for animals. In a thoughtful review of the topic, Feinstein (1982) stressed that beyond identification and removal of the underlying cause, treatment of DIC must be individualized and generalizations are difficult. Patients that are actively bleeding or require surgery should have factors replaced, and not receive heparin.",

Frozen plasma does not contain therapeutic levels of unstable factors such as VIII and V. Uses for FP include acute severe warfarin toxicity and hemophilia B. Plasma is sometimes used in animals as a source of albumin because species-specific albumin solutions are not available. When plasma was removed from normal dogs and replaced with crystalloid, hypoalbuminemic edema developed after 70% plasma dilution over a 3-hour period (Cervera and Moss, 1978) . Albumin is difficult to supply in adequate amounts to reverse hypoalbuminemia. Approximately 60% of the total body albumin is located in the interstitial space and the concentration is in equilibrium with that in the plasma. If hypoalbuminemia develops, the calculated plasma albumin deficit represents only 40% of the whole-body deficit. If albumin is being lost via kidney or gastrointestinal tract, the albumin supplied by transfusion is quickly lost. Acute reversible hypoalbuminemia, such as might occur with burns, might respond well to plasma transfusion. Otherwise, hypoproteinemia is better treated by parenteral or enteral alimentation or other nutritional support. In catabolic states, infused albumin is metabolized as a calorie source.

Platelet transfusions are given less frequently in animals than in man because of difficulties in preparing the needed volumes and because storage time is so short. Essentially no functional platelets are present in stored refrigerated whole blood or packed red cells. Even fresh whole blood will not contain adequate platelets in volumes commonly transfused to raise the platelet count of a thrombocytopenic animal. In humans patients, a standard platelet transfusion contains platelets concentrated from 6-8 units of blood. These are stored as platelet-rich plasma for up to 4-5 days at room temperature with constant rocking to prevent aggregation. A platelet pack of 6 units is expected to raise the platelet count of the adult human recipient by approximately 60,000/\u03bc1 imme diately after the transfusion. Thus a 50-pound dog receiving 1 unit of fresh whole blood or platelet-rich plasma would be expected to have an increase of approximately 20,000/\u03bc1; 1 unit per 10 kg has been estab lished as a reasonable starting dose. Further units can be given depend ing on the posttransfusion count and clinical status of the patient. A practical approach in bleeding thrombocytopenic animals is to supply at least some platelets as fresh whole blood. Red cell replacement has the added benefit of increasing platelet-to-platelet and platelet-toendothelium interaction. Thus bleeding time may be improved in thrombocytopenic patients through red cell transfusion (Escolar et al., 1988) .",

The group B cat is an exception because it is likely to have strong anti-A antibodies. If group A red cells are given to a group B cat, the cells are destroyed within minutes and the cat may also experience an acute complement-mediated shocklike reaction.

In a delayed reaction, hemolysis may occur from a few days to 2 weeks later as antibodies are produced.

The transfusion initiates a secondary immune response with a rapid rise in antibody. This may be subclinical and not noticeable unless transfused cells were labeled and survival measured. If destruction is more rapid, icterus may develop and the beneficial effect of the transfusion is shortened. The DAT should be checked whenever the drop in Hct is more rapid than expected because antibody-coated transfused cells will be positive. This effect is difficult to appreciate in patients transfused for treatment of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. These patients are DATpositive pretransfusion and often destroy transfused cells rapidly. The antibody may not be detectable in the patient's serum because it is all absorbed onto the red cells.

Increased potassium predis poses to citrate toxicity because potassium and citrate both adversely affect cardiac rhythm and function.

The first suspicion that transfusion might be immunosuppressive was related to the observation of improved renal allograft survival in transfused patients (Opelz and Terasaki, 1978) . More recently, human cancer patients that were transfused at the time of tumor resection had shorter survival times than patients of the same stage of disease that were not transfused (Blumberg and Heal, 1987) . In addition, those patients that received whole blood did worse than those receiving packed red cells. It has been suggested that plasma contains histocompatibility antigens, antiidiotypic antibodies, or other immunoregulatory substances that could cause immunosuppression. In an animal model of blood transfusion and tumor recurrence, plasma was the component associated with the highest rate of tumor growth (Horimi et al., 1983) . In addition to immune suppression, transfusion, especially with stored red cells, has been thought to cause reticuloendothelial blockade. The fixed macrophages in the spleen and liver engulf red cells and then are unable to phagocytize organisms. This phenomenon is not likely to be clinically significant.",

These are most efficient for rapid processing of large volumes of blood. Because the extracorporial volume is relatively large, these machines are not readily adaptable for animals under 10-15 kg. If equipment is unavailable or if the patient is very small, apheresis may be done manually by removing a volume of blood, separating the component by centrifugation, and returning the rest to the animal. Because the volume exchanged in a standard protocol is usually one plasma volume, manual apheresis requires removal of approximately four samples of 20 ml/kg each. Each exchange results in a progressive decrease in removal of the abnormal substance, because of dilution of plasma by replacement fluid. Plasmapheresis has been shown to be of definite value in treatment of hyperviscosity syndrome both in human and canine patients (Nose et al., 1983; Klausner et al., 1986) . Because the paraprotein is confined primarily to the vascular space and the rate of synthesis is slow, removal every few weeks may be the only treatment required early in the disease. In certain immune-mediated diseases in which antibody production is more rapid, removal results in temporary improvement, but rapid rebound of antibody systhesis requires follow-up immunosuppressive therapy. Immune-mediated diseases most likely to respond to plasmapheresis are myasthenia gravis, Guillian-Barre syndrome, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Plasmapheresis is the treatment of choice for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in human patients; this condition has not been reported in animals. Therapeutic apheresis has been used clinically by this author and others in small numbers of dogs (Matus et al., 1985; Klausner et al., 1986) .",
