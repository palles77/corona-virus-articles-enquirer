Recombinant measles virus (rMV) expressing HPV genotype 16 L1 capsid protein was generated by construction of an antigenomic plasmid, followed by rescue using the human \"helper\" cell line 293-3-46. In cell cultures the recombinant MV-L1 virus replicated practically as efficiently as the standard attenuated MV established as commercial vaccine, devoid of the transgene. The high genetic stability of MVb2-L1 was confirmed by 10 serial viral transfers in cell culture. In transgenic mice expressing the MV receptor CD46 the recombinant induced strong humoral immune responses against both MV and HPV; the antibodies against L1 exhibited mainly neutralizing capacity. Our data suggest that MV is a promising vehicle for development of inexpensive and efficient vaccines protecting from HPV infection.",

Appropriate treatment can prevent in most cases the development of cervical cancer. However, HPV testing is limited by social issues and the high cost.

Structural protein L1 from high risk types represents an optimal target for prophylactic vaccines [7, 8] . There is actually several prophylactic HPV vaccine formulations based upon the major viral capsid protein L1, either as monomers or as a virus like particles (VLPs). Bivalent Cervatrix by GSK contains L1 from HPV 16 and 18, and quadrivalent Gardasil by Merck contains in addition L1 derived from HPV 6 and 11 [9] . These vaccines are highly immunogenic and appear safe, although adverse effects have been described [10] . Nevertheless, their high cost does not permit generalized access to populations at risk, which is particularly relevant in developing countries [10] . Thus, recombinant measles virus (rMV) expressing L1 from an inserted transgene might constitute a suitable second generation vaccine.",

Attenuated MV strains are highly efficient and safe vaccines, typically protecting recipients from measles for their entire life [11] . To benefit from these extraordinary vaccination properties MV cDNA plasmids have been constructed to produce precisely initiated and terminated MV antigenomes related to the Edmonston B vaccine strains, and a helper-cell-based system has been established which allows the rescue of MV from such MV antigenomic plasmids [12] . This technology allows the construction of genetically altered MV and of recombinant MV derivatives (rMVs) expressing proteins from inserted transgenes [13, 14] . The most complex rMV generated so far, exceeding in length the standard MV by more than 5000 nucleotides, contains the coding regions for green fluorescent protein (GFP), betagalactosidase (\u03b2-gal) and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT), engineered into three positions of the MV antigenome; the inserted coding regions are expressed from independent transcription units [15] . These transgenes were expressed at different levels, according to their genomic position, and were stably maintained over many viral generations. The ability to construct new recombinant and chimeric MVs opens the prospect to develop new vaccines based on MV. The limited immunization experiments carried out so far with rMVs have been encouraging [15] [16] [17] .",

(Nomenclature: p(+)MV stands for plasmid delivering correctly T7-initiated and ribozyme-terminated antigenomic MV RNA [12] ; b specifies the Berna vaccine strain sequence; the numbers 1, 2 or 3 indicate the place where the additional transcription unit (ATU) is inserted: 1 upstream of the N gene, 2 between the P and the M gene, 3 between the H and the L gene; only position 2 has been used here. Transgenic ORFs are appended directly after the number indicating the position of the ATU). The HPV 16 L1 gene (source: Rhein Biotech, Germany) was amplified by PCR using the following oligos: For _L1: 5\u2032-TTG GCGCGC c ATG AGC CTG TGG CTG CCC-3\u2032; Rev _L1: 5\u2032-AT GACGTC TCA CAG CTT CCT CTT CTT CCTC-3\u2032 caring, respectively, the BssHII and AatII cloning sites (underlined and boldface). The PCR product digested with BssHII and AatII was inserted into p(+)MVb2 (Zuniga et al., in preparation) using the same enzymes, to obtain p(+)MVb2-HPV-L1. All cloning procedures were performed basically as described previously [18] [19] [20] and sequences were confirmed by sequencing the entire inserted regions of the plasmids.",

The replication kinetics of the recombinant rMVb2-HPV-L1 was almost indistinguishable from that of the parent MVb. This behaviour appears not unusual, given the fact that many ORFs inserted into MV vectors did not slow down the propagation of the recombinant, yet others did only slightly in cell cultures [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . The propagation properties appear particularly favourable in case of this vaccine candidate, considering the fact that generally insertion of additional genes in the genome of viruses belonging to other Mononegavirales has been shown to result in slower viral growth kinetics, due to alteration of the gene expression gradient (for a review of recombinant Mononegavirales, and in particular rMVs, see [21] ). The rescued rMVb2-HPV-L1 seems to faithfully maintain the inserted coding sequences over multiple passages in cell culture, although we cannot exclude the possibility that during the extensive amplification factor of about 10 33 minor mutations arise. However, the stability of expression after extensive amplification suggests a surprisingly high fidelity of MV RNA polymerase and essentially no RNA recombination by copy choice, which would eventually lead to deletions [21] .",

These characteristics render the recombinant rMVb2-HPV-L1 an attractive candidate to develop a prophylactic, low cost vaccine against HPV infection. Eventually, additional insertions of the early HPV genes E6 and E7 appear not only perfectly feasible but might allow such recombinants to be also of therapeutic use to treat individuals persistently infected with HPVs or even already affected by cervical carcinoma. Construction of recombinant p(+)RMVb2-HPV-L1 plasmid. The HPV16-L1 gene was amplified by PCR and the resulting product was cloned into the MV genome context via BssHII and AatII. Immunofluorescence analysis for expression of HPV-L1 protein by recombinant MVs. Monolayers of Vero cells grown on tissue culture chamber slides were infected either with MVb (A) either with rMVb2-HPV-L1 (B) at MOI 0.05 for 48 h and processed for immunofluorescence. Cells were stained with a monoclonal anti-HPV-L1 antibody subsequently with a goat anti-mouse coupled to FITC (green). The same slides were stained with DAPI and visualized by an inverted Leica microscope under normal and fluorescent light, respectively.
