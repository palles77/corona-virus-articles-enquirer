We developed a simple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for hMPV serological testing using the nucleoprotein (N) from group A or B (N-A or N-B) as the antigen, and we evaluated it in both children and adults. The N proteins were first used in a Western immunoblot assay to identify hMPV-negative sera, which were then used to determine the cutoff value of the ELISA test. Subsequent evaluation of the ELISA-N test revealed that the mean reciprocal antibody titer of 20 randomly selected seropositive children was 143, compared to 69 for 20 seropositive adults.",

Limited reports have indicated that virtually all children are infected by 5 to 10 years of age (10, 24, 29) . The virus has been associated with ARTI in all age groups, with more severe diseases such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children, elderly subjects, and immunocompromised hosts (2, 4, 12, 17, 27) . The importance of hMPV has been best studied in young children with severe ARTI, accounting for 5 to 10% of hospitalizations in that population (4, 11, 14) . Although there is considerable overlap in the clinical features of hMPV and hRSV infections, the latter has been generally associated with a more severe outcome (4, 18, 26, 27) .",

Nucle-otide and amino acid sequence identities between two strains representing the two major hMPV groups were found to be 80 and 90%, respectively, which is similar to identities between hRSV groups A and B (1).

Those assays were found to be sensitive and specific for detecting aMPV antibodies, with the recombinant protein-ELISA test being more sensitive than assays using virus-infected Vero cells as the antigen (16) . Until now, serological assays for hMPV have consisted of immunofluorescence assays or ELISA tests using hMPV-infected cells (2, 9, 10, 12, 24, 29) . These assays are not suitable for large-scale epidemiological studies, and they have not been well validated with other related paramyxoviruses, such as hRSV, or for their ability to detect both hMPV genotypes.

The N genes of hMPV isolates CAN97-83 (group A) and CAN98-75 (group B) (1) were amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) using primers N1 (5\u0408-CGTA CATATGATGTCTCTTCAAGGGATTCAC) and N2 (5\u0408-GTCCCTCGAGTT ACTCATAATCATTTTGACTGTC) for group A and N3 (5\u0408CGTACATATG ATGTCTCTTCAAGGGATTC) and N4 (5\u0408-GTCCCTCGAGTTACTCATA ATCATCTTG) for group B. The PCR products were purified on gel and cloned into the pET19b(\u03e9) vector (Novagen, Madison, Wis.), which contains a His 6 tag downstream of the T7 promoter. The vectors were transformed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), and the expression of the recombinant proteins was induced by 0.1 mM of isopropyl-\u2424-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were centrifuged at 22,000 \u03eb g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, resuspended in a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole at pH 7.9), and then lysed by sonication. The N proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose matrices (QIAGEN, Valencia, Calif.) that bind the His 6 tag. The N proteins were further purified on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) 12% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.) to eliminate contaminating E. coli proteins. The 45-kDa band was excised from the gel, followed by protein extraction and elution with Nanosep 0.2-m columns (Pall Life Sciences, Quebec City, Canada).",

It has been demonstrated that recombinant protein ELISAs were more sensitive than those using virus-infected cells or inactivated virus as the antigen for detecting aMPV antibodies (15, 16) . Among the hMPV proteins, the nucleoprotein (N) along with the matrix (M) and the fusion (F) proteins are the most conserved between representatives of the two hMPV groups (1). In contrast, the G and SH proteins are the most variable, with only 37 and 59% amino acid identity between the two groups. A study by Gulati et al. revealed that the N protein was better than M for detecting antibodies against the three aMPV groups (16) . The N antigen has also been successfully used to develop serological assays for bovine and human RSVs and the coronavirus associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (6, 21, 30) . In pneumoviruses, the N gene is also among the most expressed genes, and its related protein has been shown to be immunogenic. Furthermore, antibodies against N appear early and predominate throughout the infection (6, 21, 28) . Consistent with those properties, we hypothesized that the N protein was a good antigen to use in developing a serological test for hMPV.",

Falsey et al. also detected a high seroprevalence for this virus in adults by ELISA using viral cell lysates (12) . We compared mean antibody titers in those two populations and observed that hMPV titers were higher in young children (0 to 4 years), consistent with a primary infection early in life. We also found out that 81.6% of adult patients with COPD were seropositive for hMPV. Assuming that virtually all children are infected by 5 to 10 years of age (10, 24, 29) , this result indicates that adults can lose their antibodies or that titers were below the cutoff value of our assay. In any case, adults can be reinfected by hMPV as indicated in previous studies (2, 12) and in the present work, where 3 (4.2%) of 71 adults with exacerbation of COPD demonstrated a seroconversion for this pathogen in the ELISA N-A test. This percentage is consistent with that in a study reporting that hMPV was responsible for 4.5% of ARTI within a population of healthy adults and high-risk subjects with underlying cardiopulmonary diseases (12) . Patients with COPD are more susceptible to severe respiratory infections than the general population, and other studies would be required to confirm the rate of hMPV (re)infection in healthy adults. At least one case of hMPV reinfection has been reported by our group in a young immunocompromised child (19) . Whether reinfections in adults are generally caused by a different or the same hMPV genotype remains to be determined. Serological testing for hMPV only permits a retrospective diagnosis, and a seroconversion or a \u05464-fold rise in antibody titers must be demonstrated to confirm recent infection. We have used antigens from both viral groups (N-A and N-B) to detect recent hMPV group A infections and, as expected, the increase in titers was higher with the ELISA N-A test. However, there was clearly an important cross-reactivity with the N-B protein, indicating that those two proteins are antigenically related (22) and that antibodies can recognize conserved epitopes from both N proteins. Based on those results, we conclude that any of the two N proteins can be used as the antigen for the ELISA serological test.",

This is particularly true during reinfections of adult patients, for whom viral excretion is of limited duration. Indeed, a combination of PCR on March 24, 2020 by guest http://cvi.asm.org/ and serology has been shown to have greater sensitivity than each test alone for hRSV diagnosis in adults (13) . Such an approach could also be of interest for hMPV, as shown by our small study in COPD patients, where we were able to confirm one additional hMPV infection by serology compared to PCR. In summary, our ELISA-N test is a fast, sensitive, and specific serological assay which will be of benefit in better understanding the epidemiology of hMPV in various populations of patients.",
