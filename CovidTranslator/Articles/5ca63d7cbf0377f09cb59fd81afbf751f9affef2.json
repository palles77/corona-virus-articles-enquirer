To date, the only parvovirus known to be pathogenic in humans is B19, which is responsible for Fifth disease in children (2) . The role of HBoV in respiratory tract illnesses is unknown. We retrospectively investigated HBoV in Canadian patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in 2003 and 2004 to assess the impact of HBoV infections on respiratory tract illnesses and identify the signs and symptoms of this illness.",

Viral DNA was extracted from 285 \u00b5L of original samples with a BioRobot MDx and the QiAamp Virus BioRobot MDX kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). We used 5 \u00b5L of DNA in a volume of 50 \u00b5L containing 20 pmol of each primer. The thermocycler conditions were 95\u00b0C for 15 min for activation of HotStartTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen); 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 54\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min; and extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Nucleotide sequences of NP-1 gene amplicons were determined with an ABI 377 Sequencer and a fluorescent dye terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). DNA sequences were assembled and analyzed with SEQMAN, EDITSEQ, and MEGALIGN programs in Lasergene (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). To avoid cross-contamination, specimen processing, DNA extraction, amplification, and analyses were conducted in different rooms. For DNA extraction and PCR procedures, we included 12 negative controls per 96-well plate.",

This finding supports those of Allander et al. with regard to the association of HBoV with respiratory disease (1) . It also demonstrates that HBoV was present in Canada in 2003 and 2004, which suggests that it may be circulating worldwide. Since this study used only samples from ARI patients who tested negative for influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, adenovirus, RSV, and HMPV, dual infection cannot be excluded. In addition, whether HBoV is present asymptomatically in humans cannot be excluded because samples from healthy persons were not tested.",

Most respiratory viruses show a seasonal distribution with peak activity in winter. Human parvovirus B19, the only parvovirus that is pathogenic in humans, is also seasonal, with peak occurrences in spring and summer (3) . In contrast, no seasonal prevalence was observed for HBoV infection; the virus was found throughout the year. The lack of seasonality observed for HBoV may have been caused by the low prevalence in this study. Thus, additional year-round studies are needed to better understand the epidemiology of HBoV. Most (89%) hospitalizations were in persons <5 years of age, which suggests that HBoV may cause more severe respiratory illness in infants and children, similar to disease caused by RSV (4, 5) , HMPV (6,7), human coronavirus NL63 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , and human coronavirus 229E (15) . More comprehensive studies with data on prevalence, risk factors, and use of health services are needed to determine the role of HBoV in ARI and its effect on the healthcare system.
