However, consideration must also be given to the safety of the transfusion recipient even if the emerging infection is a respiratory disease. Previous studies indicated that viral RNA could be detected from plasma or serum of patients infected with SARS-CoV [5] [6] [7] [8] , MERS-CoV [9] , or SARS-CoV-2 [1] during different periods after the onset of symptoms. However, the detection of viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is not equivalent to the detection of intact infectious virus. Although WHO noted in 2003 that no cases of SARS-CoV have been reported due to transfusion of blood products, there was still a theoretical risk of transmission of SARS-CoV through transfusion [10] . With more and more asymptomatic infections being found among COVID-19 cases, blood safety is worthy of consideration. In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 via transfusion as of February 10, 2020, and discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Many studies found that SARS-CoV RNA could be detected in the plasma of SARS patients even though it is a respiratory disease. The first report published on April 10, 2003 [5] , indicated that extremely low concentrations of viral RNA existed in plasma of a SARS patient during the acute phase of illness, at 9 days after the onset of symptoms. The viral content of plasma was low. Researchers could only detect SARS-CoV RNA using a nested PCR assay established in-house, and the viral load was 190 copies/mL performed after ultracentrifugation of 2 mL of plasma. They could not detect viral RNA in the plasma collected from two close contacts, although the sputum of one was positive by 3 of 4 different PCR assays and the viral load in sputum was as high as 6.3\u00d710 4 copies/mL. Based on this study and other information, WHO [10] and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [19] drafted recommendations on blood safety and pointed out a theoretical risk of transmission of the SARS virus through transfusion of blood products. They also recommended some precautionary principles regarding the deferral of blood donation by individuals from areas with recent local transmission. In addition, blood donors should report to collection agencies if they were diagnosed as suspected or confirmed SARS patients within 1 month following their donation; and in such instances, efforts would be made to trace recipients or recall any blood products not transfused. Later, two studies focused on new PCR methods for detection of SARS-CoV RNA. One study was based on serial analysis of plasma viral RNA concentrations in adult SARS patients by quantitative reversetranscription PCR with a limit of detection of 74 copies/mL. The study found that, on the first day of fever onset, 50% (6/12) of confirmed patients had detectable viral RNA in plasma and that, by day 14, the proportion fell to 25% (3/12). Overall, 78% of patients had detectable viral RNA in the first week of their illness [7] . Similar to the first study, the average viral concentration was low at 140 copies/mL in patients who had relatively mild symptoms and did not require intensive care unit admission in hospital. In pediatric patients, 87.5% (7/8) of children had viremia, and the median concentration of plasma was 357 copies/mL based on the same PCR method used with adult SARS patients above [8] . Finally, Grant et al [6] reported that within 3 days after fever onset, 79% (19/24) of patients had detectable SARS-CoV RNA in plasma. The viral load level rose fast, and the maximal viral load was at around day 4 or day 5 after the onset of fever, after which the viral load quickly decreased. Their findings showed viral shedding in plasma was common when people were clinically ill with SARS virus and that plasma may be a better sample compared with nasal and throat swabs. The detection sensitivity of plasma was equivalent to that of nasopharyngeal aspirates within the first 3 days after the onset of fever.",

Researchers in Hong Kong [27] found that tests of the plasma from 3 of 400 healthy blood donors and 1 of 131 nonpneumonic pediatric inpatients collected during the outbreak of SARS tested positive for IgG antibody to SARS-CoV. The results were confirmed by two Western blot assays. The presence of antibody does not imply infectious material. Nevertheless, because Hong Kong was among the worst-hit regions in the world during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, they concluded that, in Hong Kong, subclinical or nonpneumonic SARS-CoV infections existed, indicating a potential transmission risk of SARS virus via blood products. Soon afterward, four different groups raised questions and objections to the Hong Kong study focusing on the specificity of the assays and the representativeness of the population [28] [29] [30] [31] . To provide additional information, the theoretical the risk of SARS-CoV transmission through blood transfusion was estimated in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, in China. The estimate used data from Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and Taiwan in 2003 and calculated that the mean risk was 14.11 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.00-17.22) per million and the maximum risk was 23.57 (95% CI: 6.83-47.69) per million on April 2, 2003 [32] .",

A family cluster of COVID-19 was reported from Shenzhen, China, and it was found that serum from 1 of 6 patients in one family showed a weak positive result for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and a 10-year-old child was confirmed to be an asymptomatic carrier [37] . With the virus spreading all over the world, reports from Vietnam [38] , Germany [39] , and the United States [40] have described the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19. One controversial report suggested transmission by contact with an asymptomatic carrier in Germany [39] : an individual from China attended business meetings in Germany and infected at least 2 business partners during the incubation period. This report suggested that, in contrast to SARS, COVID-19 patients might be infectious during an asymptomatic incubation period. However, in this report, the authors did not directly interview the Chinese traveler who later was found to have been symptomatic at the time of the contact.

In-house studies of methods to inactivate coronaviruses in plasma and platelet concentrates focused mainly on heat and solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment. Usually, 60\u00b0C for 15-30 minutes is enough for reduction of SARS-CoV from plasma without cells [49] , and inactivation could be achieved by 60\u00b0C for 10 hours for plasma products [52] . In the other study, heating at 56\u00b0C for 25 minutes could reduce more than 4 log 10 TCID 50 /mL of MERS virus [53] . Because heating could denature protein in blood products, it could only be used in manufactured plasma-derived products. In addition, SARS-CoV was found to be sensitive to solvent and detergent, such as TNBP/Triton X-100, TNBP/Tween 80, and sodium cholate [49] . After 30-minute treatment using S/D produced by Octaplas (Octapharma), the virus was reduced more than 5.75 \u00b1 0.3 log 10 TCID 50 /mL [50] .",

These commercial systems could reduce the activities of SARS and MERS virus in plasma or platelet concentrates to different degrees. Methylene blue plus visible light also has the ability to inactivate coronaviruses in plasma [45, 48] . Cost remains a major administrative obstacle to PRT use [55] .

In China, most of blood centers or blood banks have taken the following measures during the current outbreak: (1) taking body temperature before blood donation; (2) additional questions in the donor screening questionnaire regarding whether the donor or relatives have related symptoms, have traveled to areas with local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan or Hubei province) within 28 days, or are donors with high risk; (3) calling back all blood donors and asking the donors and their family about their current physical condition after donation; and (4) recalling untransfused blood products from infected donors [57] . However, given the differences between SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, it is not known if the prior recommendations used for SARS and MERS are sufficient. We are facing many unknowns, and careful monitoring and further studies should continue. Stricter measures could be implemented if necessary, such as viral RNA and virus-related antibody screening of blood donations or use of PRT in some regions. As we know, the Wuhan Blood Center and all blood banks in Hubei province have started to test SARS-CoV-2 RNA from blood donations since February 10. Meanwhile, because coronaviruses RNA could be detected in plasma or lymphocytes, staff in blood centers and laboratories should improve biosafety protection during the epidemic. The coming months will provide an enormous amount of new information on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19-information which will allow us to make decisions regarding this new virus and public safety.",
