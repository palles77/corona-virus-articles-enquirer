[1] [2] [3] The detailed mechanisms that drive these complex interactions are largely unknown; consequently, it is difficult to predict the behavior of this highly nonlinear system. Downstream consequences can be influenced by activities of other organisms, use of antimicrobials, or the host's immune response. 1 In immunocompromised subjects, such as neonates, elderly adults, and patients undergoing chemotherapy, the addition of an unfamiliar pathogen can offset the delicate equilibrium and increase the likelihood of pathogenic invasion. 2 In individuals with functional immune systems, internalized microbes are eliminated, whereas noninternalized pathogens can thrive within the respiratory microbiome, thereby using their hosts as vectors. However, these asymptomatic individuals can still pose a threat of transmitting the potentially pathogenic agent to at-risk subjects.",

This multiplex assay is performed from a single patient specimen and has high levels of specificity and sensitivity (Table 1) . Little is known about the colonization rates of respiratory pathogens in asymptomatic adult subjects, especially for viruses. Here, we describe the frequency and seasonal variation of bacterial and viral detections in asymptomatic health care professionals (HCPs) during the winter and summer months of 2014. Seasonal variation of infectious disease rates is a common phenomenon that is clearly manifested when temperatures are at extremes; consequently, there may be seasonality of colonization levels and commensal relationships of pathogens in asymptomatic individuals. 4 By elucidating changes in pathogen colonization rates in asymptomatic HCPs during different time periods in the year, health care organizations can monitor which potentially pathogenic agents are most prevalent in carriers in a health care setting and observe correlations with infection levels in at-risk hospitalized patients. 5 New mechanisms of pathogen transmission can be hypothesized and tested, which could be potentially important in a clinical setting and have a positive effect on infection control practices.",

HCP categories included medical students, nurses (intensive care unit and general patient care), physicians, and residents. Pertinent histories, including recent upper respiratory symptoms and antibiotic use, were obtained. All 200 HCPs were asymptomatic for a minimum of 4 weeks before samples were taken. Each HCP completed a questionnaire that evaluated their respiratory status. Questionnaires were reviewed by physicians at Huntsville Hospital, and it was determined that none of the subjects likely had current infections during specimen collection intervals. None of the physicians who participated in the study reviewed the surveys. Eligibility criteria required HCPs be free of respiratory symptoms for at least 4 weeks prior to specimen collection and agree to provide a nasopharyngeal specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected in 2014 during January-February and June-July, representing the winter and summer observations, respectively. Specimens were sent via courier to Diatherix Laboratories. Results were sent to the study coordinator at Huntsville Hospital within 24 hours of sample receipt, and study participants were notified of the results.",

Prior to the 4-week asymptomatic period, 34 of the 200 subjects had symptoms of a respiratory illness, and 14 of the 200 received antibiotic treatment. A more detailed description of the subject sample is shown in Table 2 . Figure 2 displays a summary of the respiratory pathogen detection percentage partitioned by profession and season. In the winter, residents represented the subset of HCPs with the largest frequency of colonization because 26 (60.5%) of the 43 were positive for at least 1 bacterial or nonbacterial pathogen. However, the highest proportion of viruses was seen in nurses because 7 (21.2%) of the 33 tested were detected with coronavirus. In the summer, as in winter, residents had the highest frequency of detection because 14 (43.8%) of the 32 tested were positive for at least 1 pathogen. Nurses exhibited a slightly lower level of colonization because 19 (46.3%) of the 41 had at least 1 pathogen detection. Figure 3 characterizes all of the HCPs in both seasons that had a codetection for 2 genetic targets. A larger number of subjects exhibited codetections during the winter because 12 (25.5%) of the 47 subjects were detected with 2 genetic targets. Of the 19 positive detections for MRSA, 4 (21.1%) were positive for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) cytotoxin gene, which represented the highest frequency of simultaneously detected genetic targets. Eight (30.8%) of the 26 residents had >1 detection. In the summer, 1 resident had 3 bacterial detections, whereas no HCPs in the winter exhibited >2 detections.",

One study reported results comparable with the 11% HCoV detection frequency found in HCPs at Huntsville Hospital. 6 Taiwan and found that 25 (11.5%) were colonized with SARS-CoV. 6 The nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV in large hospitals was a major epidemic feature during early stages of the outbreak, but this problem was resolved after hospitals isolated all symptomatic patients and asymptomatic HCPs detected with SARS-CoV. 7 All 11 detections for HCoV at Huntsville Hospital also came from frontline asymptomatic HCPs, predominantly nurses. Observations from this study and the Ho et al study suggest that coronavirus could possibly be spread from infected patients to frontline HCPs through close contact or via contaminated droplets, but further studies are needed to substantiate this hypothesis. M catarrhalis exhibited seasonal variation because 11 HCPs tested in the winter were positive, but all subjects were negative in the summer. The presence of M catarrhalis was unexpected because colonization usually only occurs in children, and only 3% of healthy adults are colonized. 8 The high winter detection frequency of M catarrhalis observed could be a result of the temperaturedependent characteristics of the organism. At lower temperatures, the speed of transcription and abundance of mRNA transcripts increases, M catarrhalis grows and divides at a more rapid rate, and the organism's pathogenic behavior has a higher probability of being activated. 9,10 M catarrhalis can live commensally for extended periods; therefore, the incubation time of this organism is not well defined. However, M catarrhalis can become pathogenic in subjects with compromised immune systems or in subjects that have experienced nasopharyngeal stress, such as patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 11 As a result, it may be valuable to determine which HCPs are colonized with M catarrhalis and determine whether there is a correlation with infection rates in at-risk patients. 12 S aureus and MRSA were frequently detected in both winter and summer. The high prevalence of healthy subjects colonized with S aureus and MRSA has been well described. 13 Commonly, S aureus and MRSA act as commensals of the upper respiratory tract, but if a patient is immunocompromised, a potentially fatal infection can develop. As a result, many hospitals implement S aureus and MRSA infection reduction protocols and use active surveillance programs to decolonize patients before admission or surgery. 14 S aureus and MRSA also attack the lower respiratory tract where organisms are often parasitic and cause bacterial pneumonia. 15 In this study, 4 HCPs in the winter and 1 HCP in the summer were colonized by PVL-positive MRSA. PVL is a potent cytotoxin produced by S aureus that causes necrotizing pneumonia with a high mortality rate. 16 Many hospitals have already implemented decolonization procedures for patients colonized with S aureus and MRSA, but future studies could support the decolonization of asymptomatic HCPs.",

Summer detection was anticipated because the prevalence of K pneumoniae infections, especially bloodstream infections, increases during the summer. 17, 18 The seasonal variation in K pneumoniae colonization is not well understood. It has been reported that higher rates of K pneumoniae colonization are primarily related to the use of antibiotics. Here, only 1 (14.3%) of the 7 HCPs that were colonized with K pneumoniae recently received antibiotics. 19 K pneumoniae can be easily and rapidly transmitted to immunocompromised patients from the hands of contaminated HCPs. 5 Similar to PVL-positive S aureus and MRSA, K pneumoniae can also infect to the lower respiratory tract causing abnormalities such as bulging interlobar fissures, cavitary abscesses, and necrotizing pneumonia. 20, 21 As a result, detecting and decolonizing the carriers of K pneumoniae could have a positive impact on reducing high-risk transmission and hospital-acquired infections during the summer, particularly in patients with comorbidities.",

Five different viruses, including adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, coxsackievirus-echovirus, and pandemic influenza A H1N1-09, were detected at least once in either or both seasons. There are few studies that investigate the effects of viral colonization or coinfections in the upper respiratory tract. Previous reports show that the prevalence of viral pathogens may increase bacterial colonization and risk of infection in the nasopharynx. 22 In addition, 1 study proposed a colonization-competition model for RNA viruses and predicted that low-virulence strains initially colonize human cells and then competitive, high-virulence strains prime the nasopharynx for infection. 23 Multiplex polymerase chain reaction technology can help add to these models and better define the unknown mechanisms of colonization and infection of viral pathogens.",

Presumably, many of the HCPs in this study had respiratory diseases long before this study and could be conveying nucleic acid remnants that were detected by TEM-PCR. The 4-week clearance period (as previously described in the Methods section) was intended to reduce the likelihood of this possible false detection; however, the half-life of nucleic acid fragments in this setting is not known. It is almost certain that RNA remnants degrade more quickly than DNA. 24 In the winter, a larger proportion of HCPs had prior respiratory symptoms, which may have been responsible for the higher frequency of pathogens detected in this season. Further testing methods, such as culture, would need to be conducted to discriminate between nucleic acid remnants and viable microorganisms. It is also possible that the high sensitivity of multiplex polymerase chain reaction detected recent invader cells that would later cause disease in the HCP. However, for the purposes of this study, we do not discriminate between long-standing colonies and recent invader cells because both scenarios can plausibly spread pathogens to at-risk patients.",

In addition, medical students, physicians, and residents worked in diverse sections of the hospital, but nurses only worked in either the intensive care unit or the general population. A larger proportion of nurses tested during both seasons worked in the intensive care unit (26 [78.8%] in the winter, 29 [61.7%] in the summer), which could have been the reason for moderately high pathogen detection frequency in this subset. Information was unavailable to determine the proportion of time each HCP treated patients while wearing a mask. Not wearing masks would increase the likelihood of transmission from patient to HCP and vice versa. Even though this study focuses on HCP colonization, the identification and management of all possible pathogen reservoirs, such as health care surfaces, equipment, and colonized visitors, are also important for preventing the spread of infection in a clinical setting. 5 Nevertheless, the utilization of a sensitive and specific multiplexing nucleic acid assay is valuable because the assay detects multiple viral and bacterial pathogens simultaneously in asymptomatic subjects. Colonization of viral pathogens needs substantially greater understanding, and defining the unknown colonization and infection potential of these upper respiratory organisms is important. This preliminary observational study explores the prevalence of colonization of various pathogens at 2 different points in the year, and if validated with larger follow-up studies, this information could be ultimately relevant in the clinic. Determining correlations between levels of HCP colonization and at-risk patient infection rates could assist in defining novel transmission pathways. In turn, hospital protocols could be altered so that colonized HCPs and at-risk patient interactions could be managed, threat of transmission could be minimized, and infection control protocols could be optimized.",
