The nucleotide and amino acid sequence was most similar to the D1466 strain and was 84.8% and 89.9% identity, respectively. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity among the DE072 strain and other IBV strains was less than 71.9% and 76.6%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis, based on both nucleotide and amino acid sequence, showed that IBV isolates were divided into two distinct groups. The DE072 strain clustered only with the D1466 strain, and all of the other strains were distinct from those two viruses. Further the nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire spike glycoprotein gene of the DE072 strain demonstrated that most of the gene contained a D1466-like sequence, and \u00aeve putative cross-over sites were identi\u00aeed. Based on cross-over site, phylogenetic trees were constructed for different regions of the spike gene, and a difference in topology between these trees was observed. Considering the difference in S2 gene sequence identity and tree topology, we assume that DE072 and D1466 viruses share a different origin from other isolates of IBV. Furthermore, entire spike gene analysis indicates that the DE072 strain has undergone recombination event as well as extensive antigenic variation.",

Sequence variation in the \u00aerst two regions was subtle and was probably caused by either antigenic drift or recombination. However sequence variation in the region between residues 1594\u00b11876, which is at the 3 0 end of the S2 gene, probably occurred due to recombination because of a drastic homology shift. Banner et al. (1) showed that RNA recombination occurred preferentially at certain sites in the genome of murine coronavirus. This hot spot was also observed in the CU-T2 strain of IBV (10) . That work supports our observation that the 3 0 end sequence variance in the S2 gene of the DE072 strain was caused by a recombination event. Recombination is thought to occur by template switching, which depends in part on . I: trees of S1 sequences between 1\u00b1120, 270\u00b1725, and 1171\u00b11631, II: trees of S1 sequences between 1009\u00b11109, III: trees of S2 sequences between 1\u00b1983, 1028\u00b11090, and 1121\u00b11593, IV: trees of S2 sequences between 984\u00b11027, V: trees of S2 sequences between 1091\u00b11120, VI: trees of S2 sequences between 1594\u00b11876. the presence of homologous nucleotide sequence similarities between the strains (2,10). Because the 3 0 end of the S2 gene is conserved between IBV strains, it is logical that that region would favor recombination. Furthermore, secondary structure reported at the 5 0 end of gene 3 may in\u00afuence recombination at the 3 0 end of the S2 gene (18) . However, it is also possible that this recombination hot spot may be the result of selection pressure on the virus (1, 2) .",
