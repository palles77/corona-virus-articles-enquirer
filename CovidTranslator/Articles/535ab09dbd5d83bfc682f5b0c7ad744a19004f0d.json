The inter-structural gene region encodes 3 open reading frames (ORFs), termed ORFs 3a, 3b and 4, with nucleotide sequences conforming to the minimum conserved transcription signal upstream of each. An additional ORF, 3x, partially overlaps the 3 H end of ORF 3a. The FIPV interstructural gene region is identical in length when compared to the Insavc-1 strain of canine coronavirus (CCV) but differs from various strains of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) by the presence of deletions and insertions. The sizes of ORF 3a and 4 are conserved in FIPV, TGEV and CCV. However, as with CCV, the FIPV ORF 3b is truncated in comparison with TGEV.",

An additional ORF of 71 residues partially overlaps the 3 H end of FIPV ORF 3a. This ORF is present in CCV but absent from TGEV, and has been called ORF 3x (6) . Upstream of the FIPV ORF 3a and ORF 4 is the nucleotide sequence CTAAAC that is the minimum conserved transcription signal found in other FIPV, TGEV and CCV genes (6, 9) . A related sequence, CTAAAT, is present upstream of FIPV ORF 3b. For these ORFs, the distance between the transcription signal and the start of translation is conserved in the 3 coronaviruses.",

In contrast, an amber codon limits FIPV ORF 3b to only 40 residues while ORF 3b of the Purdue strain of TGEV extends 244 amino acids (3) . Although the FIPV ORF 3b is shorter, the region distal to the amber codon is similar in nucleotide sequence and identical in length to the remaining portion of the TGEV ORF 3b sequence. This is consistent with the idea that a base substitution has created a premature stop codon in the FIPV ORF 3b coding region. For CCV, ORF 3b is also limited to 31 residues.",
