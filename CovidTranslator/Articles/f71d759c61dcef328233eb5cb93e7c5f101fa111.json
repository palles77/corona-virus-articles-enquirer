Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein concentrations were measured using a rapid immunoturbidimetric assay validated for use in cats (Bence et al., 2005) . Haptoglobin concentrations were determined using a commercially available kit (Tridelta Development Ltd.). The SAA concentration was measured first, followed by the AGP and Hp concentrations, although inadequate amounts of serum were available to analyse all APPs in all samples: in Group A, seven samples were not analysed for Hp and three were not analysed for AGP; in Group B, four samples were not assessed for Hp or AGP; in Group X, five and two samples were not analysed for Hp and AGP, respectively; and in Group Y, one sample not examined for Hp or AGP.",

            "text": "To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively evaluate the APR of cats to infection with Haemoplasma spp. Given that the serum analysed was obtained during previous studies investigating haemoplasma/chronic FIV infection (Tasker et al., 2006a,b) , a concurrent systemic viral infection could have had a confounding effect on our results. A glycan moiety of AGP has been shown to be modified in cats subclinically and terminally-infected with FIV (Pocacqua et al., 2005) . In the present study lower AGP concentrations were found in FIV-infected compared with non-FIV-infected animals following CMhm infection and higher Hp concentrations occurred in FIV-infected compared with non-FIVinfected cats infected with Mhf. However, while these results were statistically significant, measurements for each group of cats remained within reference intervals and numbers in each group were small. These results are in contrast to those of Duthie et al. (1997) , where APPs were measured at a single time-point in six cats with terminal, FIV-associated disease. This study found that 5/6 and 4/6 cats had AGP and Hp concentrations above the reference intervals, respectively. Marked increases in AGP have been found during the acute phase of viral infection with feline coronavirus (Paltrinieri et al., 2004) , although decreases in APPs following viral infection, either acute or chronic, have not been described. In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, many APPs (e.g. C-reactive protein [CRP], Hp, and fibrinogen) are higher compared with non-HIV-infected controls (Jahoor et al., 1999; Treitinger et al., 2001; Delanghe et al., 2010) . Elevations in the concentration of APPs, particularly CRP, are associated with increased mortality and opportunistic disease such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (Nixon and Landay, 2010; Sage et al., 2010) in AIDS patients. CRP is not part of the feline APR (Cer\u00f3n et al., 2005) and, to the authors' knowledge, there are no studies comparing the APR between HIV and FIV infection. Serum samples taken pre-and immediately post-FIV infection from the cats in the current study were not available for analysis, and were beyond the scope of this study.",

SAA concentrations usually returned close to pre-infection values by day 44 pi consistent with a self-limiting APR, and despite sustained circulating haemoplasma copy numbers (Tasker et al., 2006a,b) . This finding indicates that an elevated SAA concentration in a haemoplasma-infected cat suggests acute (<44 days post-exposure), rather than chronic, infection. Infection with Mhf was associated with significantly higher SAA concentrations than CMhm infection, consistent with Mhf being more pathogenic (Foley et al., 1998; Westfall et al., 2001; Tasker et al., 2006a Tasker et al., , 2009 . Haematological variables had been previously assessed in these cats (Tasker et al., 2006a,b) with 10/12 Mhf-infected cats developing regenerative macrocytic, hypochromic haemolytic anaemia by day 14 pi.",

Although Mhf infection was associated with significantly greater SAA concentrations than infection with CMhm, the latter was also associated with significant increases in SAA, confirming induction of an APR by CMhm, albeit of lower magnitude. Indeed, Tasker et al. (2006a) found that CMhm infection resulted in decreased PCV in all cats, but in only one-third of animals did this decrease to the point of anaemia. The concentration of SAA also correlates with disease severity in feline pancreatitis (Tamamoto et al., 2009) , where decreases mirror clinical improvement. In the current study, the fact that treatment was not instigated when the APR was maximal and/or clinical signs were apparent may explain the lack of association between SAA concentrations and treatment found.",

It is likely that particular APPs have different sensitivities in responding to different disease processes, as is the case with SAA and C-reactive protein in humans with kidney allograft rejections (Casl et al., 1995) . Although, to the authors' knowledge, a comparison of the sensitivities of SAA and AGP in the feline APR has not been carried out, SAA increases and peaks earlier than AGP and Hp following experimentally-induced inflammation (Kajikawa et al., 1999) .",

Instead, because there were few data points recorded within this period, statistical analysis was performed on the mean APP concentrations pi for each infecting haemoplasma. Finally, the APR in cats with naturally occurring FIV and Haemoplasma spp. infection may be different from our experimentally infected animals. Differences in disease transmission and/or exposure to other pathogens may be important in this context.",
