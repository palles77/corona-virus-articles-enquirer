            "text": "Protein microarrays are useful tools for simultaneously assessing antibody reactivity against a large number of targets using only a minute amount of sample. This multiplex capability makes microarrays attractive for evaluating antibody specificity and sensitivity, measuring antibody response to vaccination or immunotherapy, screening disease-related antibody biomarkers in a high-throughput manner, and-potentially-early diagnosis and treatment of cancer and infectious diseases with a signature comprising multiple antibody biomarkers (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Binding is usually detected with a fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibody that binds the query antibody on the array. Current data assessments rely on direct comparison of signal intensities, which dramatically limits the ability to quantify the relationship between the fluorescent signal and the binding antibodies. Unlike traditional ELISA, which employs an independent standard curve to quantify the concentration of target antibodies, there is no common standard for the detection of antibodies binding to different targets on an array. Antibody affinities for their targets in serum vary, but currently, no method exists for objectively quantifying independent antibody concentrations. Improvements in the sensitivity and linearity of the dynamic range are also needed to aid in detecting low-abundance antibodies in clinical serum samples. The availability of such improvements would broaden the applicability and acceptance of protein microarrays as routine biomedical research tools (6) (7) (8) .",

            "text": "Linear calibration using IgG standards has been used previously as an indirect fluorescent detection method for antigen microarrays in infectious disease testing. However, the use of a linear standard curve limited the range of detection to approximately one order of magnitude; signals outside this range were not reliably quantified (14) (15) . The use of a nonlinear curve may ameliorate this limitation significantly (16) , but optimally fitting a nonlinear curve to data is a non-trivial problem, with solutions depending not only on the data themselves (e.g., number of points, number of unique x values, variability), but also on the desired shape, smoothness, and intended use of the curve. Thus, no single approach to curvefitting will be appropriate for all applications. In the context of calibration, fixed-form methods using logistic and power curves are commonlyused (17) (18) (19) . Alternative methods based upon flexible splines or hierarchical models have also been proposed (20-21). The ideal calibration curve will fit the data well, be smooth enough to be insensitive to experimental errors, and retain the true zero point. Visual inspection of the calibration curves is crucial to assess both fit and smoothness. Findlay and Dillard discuss several important issues with calibration, including different calibration models, methods to fit models, and methods to assess model fit and array design (17) . Retention of the true zero point is critical to ensure that the calibrated data remain on a ratio scale, which is a required property in order for the CV to be an appropriate measure of error. In our experiments we have found that power and logistic functions, parameterized using three to four parameters and estimated according to the least-squares principal, typically yield smooth curves that fit the data well. Specifically, in this work we have used both a four-parameter power curve and a three parameter logistic curve However, we caution that other experimental data and experimental conditions may require different approaches to generate appropriate calibration curves, and that calibration curves should always be inspected visually to ensure adequate fit and smoothness.",

The average intra-CV decreased from 10% to 4% and the inter-CV had no change: 10% before and after calibration with MiNC, respectively ( Table  2 ). The LOD also did not change. From this equation describing antibody-antigen interaction we know that the amount of antibody-antigen complexes formed on the microarray spots is proportional to the antibody concentration because the reaction volume and number of antigens are fixed and the K d is dependent on the affinity of the antibodies. This is consistent with our results and shows the feasibility of antibody quantification with MiNC on protein microarrays. In comparison with previously developed methods to improve the assay performance of protein microarrays and antibody microarrays, such as two-color Fab labeling or internally controlled systems (23-24), MiNC not only significantly improved the linear dynamic range, but also reduced assay variation.

            "text": "To demonstrate the feasibility of using MiNC with high density protein microarrays for the discovery of antibody based biomarkers, we fabricated protein microarrays consisting of 849 TB proteins (Figure 4) . We analyzed the immunological response to these proteins using pooled sera from Mtb challenged guinea pigs with (n = 7) and without (n = 6) immunization with rBCG, a recombinant mycobacterial vaccine. The experiment was repeated three times. The raw data were normalized by subtracting the background, estimated by the first quartile of nonspot controls (features with the same chemistry but not producing protein), and dividing by the median excess intensity of non-control spots. Calibrated data were calculated using a three-parameter logistic curve and normalized similarly. We applied SAM (11) to both the raw and calibrated log-transformed normalized data to identify the antibodies elevated in rBCG vaccinated guinea pigs compared with the non-vaccinated group. With a SAM delta value of 1.9 and an estimated false discovery rate of 0, the raw intensity enabled the identification of 16 antibody candidates ( Figure  5A ). Using the calibrated data, 35 candidates were identified ( Figure 5B and Supplementary  Table S1 ). Of note, 10 candidates identified from the raw intensity data were also identified from the MiNC calibrated data. Similar results were found using Welch's t-test in place of SAM analysis. (Supplementary Figure S2 and Supplementary Table S2 ). Although it is unknown whether the set of candidates from MiNC is actually better than the set without MiNC, the identification of a larger number of candidates with MiNC is consistent with the improved performance of antibody assays with MiNC ( Figure 5C ). These results reveal that MiNC can be used with protein microarrays and has the potential to identify more antibody biomarker candidates. The ideal antibody assay must be sensitive, reliable, and able to detect signals across a large dynamic range. In this work, we addressed these issues using the developed MiNC method and showed its advantages for antibody assays with protein microarrays. First, in traditional sandwich ELISA or multiplexed sandwich immunoassays, nonlinear fitting curves from protein standards are routinely used as a quantification method. However, non-specific binding between capture and secondary detection antibodies limits the number of targets that can be accurately quantified to less than 30-50 (25) (26) . This limitation can be overcome with protein microarrays, in which high quality fluorescein labeled detection antibodies can specifically recognize all antibodies captured by their corresponding antigens on microarray spots (27) . The binding of antibodies to their targets is clearly nonlinear. Linear curve fitting will provide accurate predictions in the mid-range of the binding curve where it is most linear, but predictions will fail at the high and low ends of the curve. Thus, utilizing a nonlinear curve to resolve the linear limit of the assay enables accurate interpolation of signal intensities for quantifying binding antibodies at the extreme ends of the curve, effectively expanding the range of accurate predictions. With MiNC, we not only are able to show whether an antibody biomarker increased with a p value but also to provide detailed information regarding the change of biomarker abundance during disease development. This information is especially valuable for the early detection and therapeutic treatment of a disease.",
