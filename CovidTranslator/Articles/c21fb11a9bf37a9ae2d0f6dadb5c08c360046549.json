Experimental studies have also shown that an active RNaseL not only degrades viral genome but is also anti-proliferative and promotes senescence and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, thus acting as a true tumor suppressor [16] [17] [18] . However, follow up studies by several groups have not identified significant number of RNaseL germline variants among families with hereditary prostate cancer 15, 19, 20 . Moreover, significant associations between RNaseL mutations/ polymorphism and sporadic prostate cancer have not been observed 19 . These observations led us to believe that alternate mechanisms and pathways leading to the activation/ expression of RNaseL could be involved in the prostate cells. One of these mechanism/ pathways may possibly be at the level of OAS1, a rate limiting enzyme in RNaseL activation. Thus a defect in OAS1 can possibly attenuate RNaseL function, but can also alter cell growth and apoptosis in an RNaseL independent manner.",

As an important part of the total constitutive activity of OAS enzymes, OAS1 activity is a rate limiting enzyme in determining RNaseL anti-viral and tumor suppressor activities 36 . Recent studies demonstrate that OAS1 can also promote apoptosis and act as an antiviral agent independent of RNaseL via paracrine mechanisms 9 . Thus OAS1 is emerging as a multifunction protein that is not only involved in innate immune response but also as a potent tumor suppressor.",

Consistent with these observations, the genotype AA appears to be a risk factor for prostate cancer (61% increased risk) whereas higher activity genotype GG protects against prostate cancer (92% lower risk).

The frequency of the G allele in ss38908277 African American set is only 0.09% (AoD_African_American, n=90) as compared to the frequency of 9.7% (exclusively from AG genotype) in our normal African American sample set (Table II) . Thus at least three independent studies performed on three different platforms (PERLEGEN: ss24415263 and ABI XPLORE: ss38908277 and our sequencing based analysis) on two diverse populations demonstrate the lack of GG genotype in subjects with African ethnicity (Sub-Saharan and African American). These results suggest that OAS1 polymorphism and perhaps spliced variants could be genetically determined in African Americans. Surprisingly, the GG genotype was observed in the Caucasian sample set and its frequency was heavily biased in favor of normal Caucasians (28.2% in normal vs. 2.4% in Cancer, OR = 16.11, p<0.0001). In contrast the AA genotype associated with prostate cancer, is high in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. For the sake of brevity we may propose that the higher incidence of prostate cancer in African Americans could be due to the lack of GG genotype, however a larger cohort and specific biological endpoint measurements such as the effect of this genotype on expression, enzyme activity, apoptosis, proliferation and other yet unknown biological activities are needed to support this statement.",

The GG genotype (in rs10774671) retains the splice site resulting in high enzyme activity whereas AA genotype disrupts the splice site leading to low enzyme activity 32 . Due to altered splicing, the three genotypes reportedly generate different OAS1 isoforms: p46 (GG), p46 and p48 (AG) and p48 (AA) 38 . The p46 and p48 isoforms have identical exons 1-6 but divergent exon 7. As expected, two transcripts corresponding to p46 (~500bp) and p48 (~400bp) isoforms were observed in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines which harbor AG genotype (rs2660) using primer pairs spanning exon 3-7. Surprisingly, LNCaP cells that also have the heterozygous AG genotype did not express any of the OAS1 spliced variants suggesting a splicing event 5\u2032 from exon 3 or between exon 3 and 7. In addition to rs2660, the rs10774671 is also in linkage disequilibrium with rs1051042 and rs3177979 (all on exon 7) 32 .

Prostate cancer is caused by multiple genes possibly interacting in complex biological pathways and influenced by environmental factors. The OAS1-RNaseL pathway fits this general hypothesis: irrespective of RNaseL mutations/ expression, low or lack of OAS1 activity, will attenuate RNaseL action and subsequently host innate immune response and tumor suppression. Thus, polymorphism in OAS1 such as rs2660 that alters its activity 32 can not only modulate the effects of higher-risk susceptibility genes (RNaseL) responsible for hereditary prostate cancer but could also promote sporadic prostate cancer independently.",

The nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism rs1131454 (nucleotide: G>A, protein: G>S) appears in all isoforms. Single nucleotide polymorphism rs2660 (G>A) is located in the last exon in isoform 3 (p48/ 9-2) resulting in G>R amino acid and in the 3\u2032UTR in isoform 1 (p46/ E18). Single nucleotide polymorphism rs34137742 (C>T) is in the intron between exons B and C. Panel B: A typical RFLP used for confirming rs1131454 SNP with Tau1 restriction digest of the amplified genomic PCR fragment using primer pairs indicated in materials and methods. Panel C: Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on mRNA isolated from LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells using primer pairs indicated in materials and methods.

Panel D: OAS1 protein expression in prostate cancer cell lines with Western Blot analysis. Whole cell lysates were used for Western Blot analysis using antibody against OAS1 and \u03b2-actin as loading control. The PCR and western blot shown here are representative of at least 3 experiments. Panel A: The probability of a particular genotype and prostate cancer calculated from a logistic regression model (P(case| genotype). Each of the genotype was used as a dependent variable in calculating its association with prostate cancer in a logistic regression model. The graph shows the probability from this model expressed as percentage. Based on this model the AA genotype increases the risk of prostate cancer by 61% compared to other genotypes. Genotype AG is neutral to the risk of prostate cancer; it neither increases nor decreases the risk of prostate cancer and genotype GG decreases the risk of prostate cancer by 92%. Panel B: Effect of age and rs2660 genotype AA on prostate cancer. Prostate cancer incidence increases with age as shown by increase in odds ratio (OR-only age effect).
