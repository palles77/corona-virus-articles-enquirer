Nearly one-third of Chinese cities were locked down in a top-down manner, and various types of economic activities were strictly prohibited. In these cities, individuals were requested to stay at home, unnecessary commercial operations, private and public gatherings were suspended, transportations were largely banned (both within a city and across cities), mandatory temperature checking could be found in most public facilities. Second, China also suffers greatly from severe air pollution problems, with some estimates suggesting that air pollution is associated with an annual loss of nearly 25 million healthy life years (Kassebaum et al., 2014) . If city lockdown indeed significantly improved the air quality in China, the implied health benefits would be an order of magnitude larger than in countries with lower initial pollution levels.",

We thus estimate a set of differencein-differences (DiD) models to quantify the impact of city lockdown on air pollution. Using air quality data from more than 1,600 monitoring stations in China, we find that city lockdown indeed improved the air quality: compared to cities without formal lockdown policies, the weekly Air Quality Index (AQI) and PM2.5 concentration in the locked-down cities declined respectively by 19.4 points (18%) and 13.9 \u00b5g/m 3 (17%). 3 To further address the concern that cities without formal lockdown policies might also be affected by the diseases preventative measures (e.g., all cities extended the Chinese Spring Festival holiday, required social distancing and urged people to stay at home), we estimate another set of DiD 3 The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a comprehensive measure of air pollution in China and also widely used around the world. The index is constructed by PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2 concentrations. models, comparing the changes in air pollution levels in these (no-lockdown) cities before and after the Spring Festival relative to the previous year, and find that in these cities the AQI and PM2.5 decreased by 8.8 points (7%), and 8.4 \u00b5g/m 3 (8%). The overall improvement in both AQI and PM2.5 by the counter COVID-19 measures is estimated to be around 25% in locked-down cities and 7~8% in other cities.",

            "text": "The remarkable improvement in air quality has three important implications. First, it could potentially bring about massive health benefits. A back-of-envelope calculation shows that the improved air quality induced the counter-COVID-19 measures could avert 24,000 to 36,000 premature deaths on a monthly basis. As air pollution also affects morbidity, productivity, and people's defensive expenditure (e.g., air filters), the implied benefits could be even greater if such improvement could sustain (e.g., Desch\u00eanes et al., 2017; Barwick et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Ito and Zhang, 2020) . Second, our findings show that traffic, industrial, and business activities are indeed important sources of air pollution. They provide a benchmark for future environmental regulations and highlight the necessity to control emissions from these sources when the business goes back to normal. Finally, while the air quality improvement during this period was unprecedented, the baseline air pollution level after city lockdown remained high. For example, the PM2.5 concentration in locked-down cities was still more than four times higher than what WHO considers safe (10 \u00b5g/m 3 for the annual mean) (WHO, 2005) , even though almost all the non-essential production and business activities were suspended. This finding suggests that other sources of air pollution continue to contribute significantly: in particular, the coal-fired winter heating system could be the primary polluting source during our study period (Chen et al., 2013; Ebenstein et al., 2017) . Our research highlights that without further reducing the reliance on coal, it will be a real challenge for the country to win its \"war against pollution\" (Greenstone and Schwartz, 2018; Greenstone et al., 2020) .",

More people likely spend their time indoor after the lockdown. If indoor air quality is worse than outdoor air quality (e.g., some areas rely heavily on inefficient coal-fired stoves for heating), the beneficial effects from better outdoor air quality could be reduced. Finally, our calculation of the averted number of deaths is not based on actual mortality data, which are not yet available to the researchers. If COVID-19 or city-lockdown affects mortality through other channels, the overall mortality costs could be higher or lower, depending on how different channels are affected. For example, medical resources in many cities run short immediately after the disease outbreak, thus patients could die because they were unable to receive timely and proper treatment (Xie et al., 2020). The counter-virus measures also negatively affected the economy and employment, which are detrimental to population health. In such cases, the excess deaths caused could be larger. In comparison, COVID-19 may have raised individuals' awareness 9 For example, the morbidity cost of air pollution is found to be around two-thirds of mortality costs in China (Barwick et al., 2018) , All rights reserved.

To improve policy compliance, civil servants and volunteers were assigned to communities, firms, business centers, and traffic checkpoints. The local government also penalized offenders if the rules were violated. There are some variations in rules and degrees of the lockdown. For example, in some cities, individuals were not allowed to go out (food and daily necessities were delivered to them), while in other cities, they could go out if they did not have a fever.
