            "text": "Infection control as a formal discipline in the United States developed during the late 1950s, primarily to address the problem of nosocomial staphylococcal infections. Over the next 50 years, the field of infection control developed slowly, initially focused on surveillance for health care-associated infections (HAIs), then incorporating the science of epidemiology to elucidate risk factors for HAIs. However, three pivotal events signaled the beginning of a new era in health care epidemiologythe Institute of Medicine's 1999 report on errors in health care, which included HAIs 1 ; the 2002 Chicago Tribune expos\u00e9 on HAIs, 2 which was the beginning of the mainstream media's interest in this topic; and the publication in 2004 and 2006 of dramatic reductions in bloodstream infection rates by simply standardizing the process of central venous catheter insertion. 3, 4 This new era in health care epidemiology is characterized by consumer demands for more transparency and accountability, increasing scrutiny and regulation, and expectations for rapid reductions in HAI rates. 5 The paradigm shifted from viewing most HAIs as an unpreventable \"cost of business\" to the vast majority being preventable. Accordingly, the focus for hospital programs shifted from infection control to infection prevention, which required rapid identification of infections and timely actions to analyze them, as well as playing an active role in the implementation of interventions for infection reduction.",

            "text": "The first aim of surveillance is to determine endemic rates of infection. Once these rates have been established, an outbreak can be identified when its rate of occurrence is significantly higher than the endemic rate. The importance of surveillance was demonstrated nearly 3 decades ago by the Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control, which found a 32% reduction in HAIs in hospitals with active surveillance programs compared with hospitals without such programs. 8 Data from hospitals in the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System demonstrated that from 1990 to 1999, nosocomial bloodstream infections decreased by 44% in medical intensive care units (ICUs), 32% in pediatric ICUs, and 31% in surgical ICUs. 9 As hospitals gained experience in standardization of patient care processes (e.g., central venous catheter insertion, head of bed elevation), further reductions in HAIs have been observed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that in the time period 2008 through 2011 there was a 41% reduction in central line-associated bloodstream infections and a 17% reduction in surgical-site infections, with only a 7% reduction in catheter-associated urinary tract infections in the time period 2009 through 2011. 10 Over the past several years, many hospitals have begun to monitor compliance with process measures, because feedback to health care workers on compliance with best practices more forcefully drives compliance than simply providing feedback on infection rates. 11, 12 Surveillance for HAIs has generally targeted areas of the hospital where the highest rates of infection, highest impact of infection, and antibiotic resistance are likely to be found. These areas include ICUs, cardiothoracic surgery units, and hematology/oncology units. However, with the current scrutiny on HAIs, hospital-wide surveillance (i.e., concurrent surveillance throughout the hospital) is becoming more prevalent and has been mandated in some states. As more hospitals implement electronic medical records, hospital-wide surveillance has become less daunting from a resource perspective. For KEYWORDS airborne precautions; antibiotic stewardship; contact precautions; droplet precautions; hand hygiene; health care-associated infections; health care epidemiologist; health care epidemiology; infection control; infection prevention; infection preventionist; isolation precautions; nosocomial infections isolation guidelines are based on current understanding of the mechanisms of the transmission of organisms, few well-controlled studies have been performed to demonstrate their efficacy. Because HAIs are relatively uncommon events, any study designed to demonstrate efficacy requires sample sizes that are often prohibitively large. Thus, studies evaluating the efficacy of infection prevention interventions often lack the power to allow one to conclude confidently that there has been a lack of effect (i.e., such studies have a high probability of type II error).",

Conversely, failure to isolate a patient with a transmissible disease may lead to morbidity and mortality and may ultimately be expensive when one considers the direct costs of an investigation of an outbreak and excess length of stay and the indirect costs of lost productivity. The practice of isolating patients has moved from the requirement for separate infectious disease hospitals to separate wards for these patients and, ultimately, to providing precautions in the general hospital environment. In 2006, the American Institute of Architects, in its Guidelines for Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities, made single-patient rooms the standard. 14 Hospitals that have single-patient rooms exclusively are able to isolate patients with transmissible diseases without disrupting patient flow. 15 However, existing facilities often still have a significant proportion of doublepatient rooms.",

It is important for hospitals to consider implementing surveillance outside of the ICU setting because the proportion of patients with invasive devices is increasing, and in many hospitals interventions to reduce infection have primarily been targeted to ICU patients.

Despite the increasing severity of illness of hospitalized patients, the greater prevalence of invasive technologies, and a higher prevalence of immunocompromised patients, some are calling for hospital epidemiologists to achieve the goal of eliminating HAIs (getting to zero). It is important that the infection prevention community acknowledge that most HAIs are preventable and respond with a strong commitment to decrease HAIs to the irreducible minimum. However, unreasonable expectations can lead to adverse unintended consequences. 45 The hospital epidemiologist as a steward of scarce resources and faced with unfunded mandates must decide how best to appropriate resources within his or her purview but must also be able to justify the cost of the marginal benefits gained by enhanced infection prevention activities in light of the impact on other programs with different goals in the health system. When considering new interventions, the hospital epidemiologist should focus on and integrate clinical outcomes, economic impact, and customer (health care provider and patient) satisfaction to balance quality and cost. 46 Emerging infectious diseases and multidrug-resistant pathogens require infection control programs to be able to respond quickly to protect patients and health care workers, even in some cases with few data on the mechanism of disease transmission.

A 2002 study using the Delphi method determined that for acute-care hospitals the optimal ratio is one collected data critically when making decisions that affect the safety of patients and health care workers. Ensuring that all decisions are evidence based and free of ideology, politics, conflict of interest, or coercion of any form should be a deeply rooted ethic for all involved in this field. care worker with a chronic bloodborne infection and his or her patients remains a challenge, as does the protection of immunosuppressed patients and of health care workers from environmental pathogens.",
