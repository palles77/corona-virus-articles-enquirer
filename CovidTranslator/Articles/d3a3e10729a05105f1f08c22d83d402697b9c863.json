Most patients are diagnosed clinically by a rapid latex agglutination detection kit or polymerase chain reaction assays for RV from stool samples, but some problems have been reported on the specificity and sensitivity of such rapid detection assays. To ratify these issues, a sensitive, specific, simple, and rapid nucleic acid based diagnostic method is expected to be introduced and the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was developed to detect the RV in human stool samples by incubation at 60\u00b0C for 1 h and amplification was confirmed by electrophoretic laddering, restriction enzyme digestion, and hydroxynapthol blue discoloration. The assay established in this study was found to detect only the RVs and no cross-reaction with other viruses, demonstrating its high specificity. By using serial samples dilution as template, the detection limit of LAMP was 10 times more than that of PCR. The results showed the potential clinical feasibility of RT-LAMP as a useful diagnostic tool for the detection of RV with high sensitivity in comparison to conventional RT-PCR.",

[17] provided a breakthrough into all these limitations and has been opted for detection of several important human and animal pathogens in the past [1, 3, 4, 8, 20, 26, 28] . It has been proven to be both cost and time effective, making it possible to have a reliable and confirmatory result within a short span of time. The LAMP reaction uses a set of four to six specific primers which recognizes distinct sequences on the target. It is estimated that target sequence got amplified up to 10 9 copies in less than an hour [17] . The non-structural protein-4 (NSP4) of RV, the first viral enterotoxin has been shown the potential as a suitable target for epidemiologic surveillance of RV infections in human beings [24] . Perusal of literature revealed that at present no human RVA detection assay using this methodology has been reported. We describe here development of a simple reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for rapid and sensitive detection of human RVA targeting consensus region of segment 10 encoding the NSP4 protein. The RT-LAMP assay was further evaluated on clinical samples collected from hospitalized children or Out Patient Department (OPD) patients visited Government Hospitals in the foothills of temperate western Himalayan region of India.",

An early identification of RV is, therefore, critical for control of disease and to minimize losses to the human life. The RV clinical diagnosis mainly relies on antigen capture ELISA and nucleic acid based amplification techniques. Of these, RT-PCR has been proved to be a powerful, sensitive and robust tool for RV detection [9, 10, 14, 15, [21] [22] [23] , but transferring RT-PCR to the field demands sophisticated and costly instrumentations. LAMP has been proved simple and efficient technique in detection of numbers of human and animal pathogens [1-5, 8, 16, 19, 20, 26, 28, 29] . Being simple, efficient and cost-effective technique, LAMP is considered as a more suitable field test for diagnosis of microbes. The naked eye visual detection of positive LAMP reactions is based on the turbidity produced due to the formation of white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate by-product. An increase in the turbidity of the LAMP reaction mixture due to the production of white precipitate correlates with the amount of DNA synthesized.",

More recently HNB, a metal indicator for easy detection of the positive LAMP reaction has come up with superior quality with regard to reducing contamination risks compared to other available dyes [6] . In this study, LAMP primers were designed targeting the conserved region of NSP4 gene of human RVA and reaction mixture conditions were optimized at annealing temperature of 62\u00b0C with 60 min incubation. The LAMP products were detected and analyzed in three ways i.e. naked eye visual detection by change in color from violet to light sky blue in the reaction mixture due to intercalating HNB dye, resolving the LAMP products in 1.5 % agarose gel and further confirmation of products by restriction digestion by AluI. The reaction products observed in Fig. 4 Sensitivity comparison of conventional RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays using human RVA partial length NSP4 gene plasmid construct. a Lane M 100-bp DNA ladder (Fermentas); Lanes 2-8 LAMP products using plasmid log dilutions starting from 1 log to 7 log dilutions. b Lane M 100-bp DNA ladder (Fermentas); Lanes 2-8 RT-PCR products using plasmid log dilutions starting from 1 log to 7 log dilutions. The RT-PCR amplicon size (206 bp) is in good agreement with the expected product size. All products were electrophoresed on a 1.5 % agarose gel Rapid detection of human rotavirus 269 agarose gel as a ladder-like pattern were due to the formation of stem-loop DNAs of varying stem length and cauliflower-like structures with multiple loops formed by sequentially inverted repeats of the target sequence. Of these detection methods, the naked visualization way of detection is more suitable for detection of Human RVA in the field (Fig. 2a) . The advantages of this method are due to its simple operation, rapid reaction, and potential for visual interpretation without instrumentation. This could make the technique far more suitable for field deployment. The sensitivity of LAMP assay calculated using the partial length NSP4 gene plasmid construct of human RVA as standard was 1.26 9 10 4 copy numbers and it was found to be 100 % specific in amplification of only human RVA when checked with other enteric viruses. After going through optimization, sensitivity and specific barrier checks, this assay along with RT-PCR was evaluated on clinical samples (n = 62) obtained from patients either hospitalized or visited hospital for treatment in Haldwani (Uttarakhand). Comparative evaluation results of conventional RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assay showed 100 % specificity and correlation over the number of samples tested where both detected 59.67 % samples positive for RV genome. However, the sensitivity of RT-LAMP was found 10 times more than conventional RT-PCR assay.",

As the assay is relatively economic and reliable, most probably LAMP will more widely integrate into routine molecular techniques.

The partial length NSP4 gene of human RVA (GenBank accession number: HQ440219) was amplified by RT-PCR using forward and reverse primers: (5 0 -AAA GAACGTGAAAACGCTAG-3 0 and 5 0 -CGGGATTAAGGC TTGAGC-3 0 ), respectively. The specific RT-PCR amplicon (206 bp) was gel-purified by using QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) and cloned into pJET1.2/blunt cloning vector (Fermentas, Lithuania). The clones were screened for the presence of the insert by colony PCR and restriction digestion with 40 U BglII enzymes (Fermentas, Lithuania). The positive clones were used further as standard for evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP assay.The optimized LAMP reaction mixture for a total of 25 lL volume contained 2 mM of hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) dye, 40 pmol each of FIP and BIP, 5 pmol each ofF3 and B3, 8 mM MgSO 4 , 1.4 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.8 M betaine and 8 U of Bst DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) in supplied buffer {20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 10 mM KCl, 10 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 and 0.1 % Tween-20}. The annealing temperature was checked from 55 to 65\u00b0C with different incubation time durations for the best amplification of target sequence.Analysis of the LAMP productsVisual detectionFor naked-eye visualization, 2 mM of HNB dye (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was added to the reaction mixture at the time of setting up of reaction. A change in the color of the reaction solution from violet to light sky blue indicate a positive reaction, while in case of negative reaction, there is no change in color.",
