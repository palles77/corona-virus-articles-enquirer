Previous studies indicated that supplemental lactoferrin may alter the microbial populations in the gut of nonruminants and increase preweaning weight gains in calves. In the present study, 40 Holstein calves were used to examine the effects of supplemental lactoferrin (0, 1, 2, or 3 g/ d) on health, growth, and feed intake from 3 d of age to 2 wk postweaning. Lactoferrin was mixed and fed with a nonmedicated milk replacer. Calves were housed in individual pens and offered a textured, nonmedicated starter and water for ad libitum consumption. Body weight and heart girth were measured weekly. Intakes of milk replacer and starter were determined daily. Fecal consistency was monitored three times per week. Calves were weaned when they met certain criteria based on body weight gain and starter intake. Preweaning fecal score responded quadratically, with the group fed 1 g/d of lactoferrin having the lowest score. Overall and preweaning number of days medicated responded in the same manner as fecal score. Preweaning average daily gain and gain-to-feed ratio increased linearly with lactoferrin supplementation, whereas postweaning gain-to-feed ratio decreased linearly with lactoferrin. Overall average daily heart girth gain increased linearly with lactoferrin. Body weight, weaning age, and dry matter intake were not different among treatments. Based on the observed improved gain-to-feed ratios, increased average daily gains, improved fecal scores,",

            "text": "It is well accepted that colostrum is an essential part of the newborn calf's diet. The primary reason for the benefits of colostrum is the passive transfer of maternal immunoglobulins to the newborn. In addition to immunoglobulins, colostrum and milk contain many other bioactive substances that are important for the development of the immune system and for fighting infections in the newborn (Shah, 2000) . Lactoferrin (LF) is among these bioactive compounds. Lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein present in the colostrum and milk of most mammals (Masson and Heremans, 1971 ) and in many body secretions including bronchial mucus (Fahy et al., 1993) and tears (Kijlstra et al., 1983) . Compared to other species, bovine milk and colostrum have relatively low concentrations of LF. Bovine colostrum contains approximately 2 mg of LF per milliliter (Tsuji et al., 1990) , and mature milk contains 20 to 200 \u03bcg/ml (Masson and Heremans, 1971) . Lactoferrin is also present at high concentrations (up to 100 mg/ml) in the mammary secretions of the nonlactating cow (Rejman et al., 1989) . As an antimicrobial protein, LF produced by the mammary gland may serve a dual role protecting both the mammary gland and the neonatal intestine from infection.",

Diarrhea can be caused by a variety of bacteria or viruses, but the most common pathogens are enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium, and Salmonellae (Tromp, 1990) . Studies have shown that LF has activity against at least two of these pathogens, E. coli (Teraguchi et al., 1994) and rotavirus (Superti et al., 1997) . These data suggest that LF may prevent infection by these organisms in the calf. Evidence has shown that LF has bacteriostatic activity in vivo. Orally administered bovine LF suppresses the proliferation of intestinal E. coli in milk-fed mice (Teraguchi et al., 1994) . If similar activity is observed in the gastrointestinal tract of young calves, there is potential for using LF as a preventative supplement to reduce the occurrence of disease or as a treatment for neonatal diarrhea.",

The iron saturation of the LF (Agri-Cell, Methuen, MA) was 13.2 mg/100 g. All calves received 2 L of good quality colostrum, tested by a colostrometer, within 3 h after birth, and another 2 L of good quality colostrum 8 to 12 h later. Calves were removed from their dam before the first colostrum feeding and placed in a naturally ventilated, enclosed calf room, in individual pens. Pens were bedded with kiln-dried sawdust. The calves remained in their pens for the duration of the study. On the day of birth, an initial BW was obtained before the second feeding of colostrum. On d 2, calves were fed a nonmedicated, all-milk protein milk replacer (Dairy Maid, Blue Seal Feeds, Londonderry, NH) in two feedings at 0700 and 1500 h. Beginning on d 2, every day each calf received 1.2% of its initial BW, in milk replacer powder. The milk replacer powder was divided into two equal portions, and each portion was reconstituted in 2 L of warm water immediately before feeding. Starting on d 3, and continuing until 14 d postweaning, calves had unlimited access to a nonmedicated starter (Calf Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 86, No. 4, 2003 Starter, Blue Seal Feeds) and fresh water. Starting on d 3, LF treatment was mixed with milk replacer and divided equally among the two feedings. Fresh starter and milk replacer were given to calves twice daily. Starter orts were collected and weighed daily. The starter consisted of steam-flaked corn, crimped oats, molasses, and pellets. Calves were weaned abruptly when they met the following four criteria: 1) minimum of 21 d old, 2) daily starter DMI was \u22651% of initial BW, for three consecutive days, 3) cumulative starter DMI was \u22659% of initial BW, and 4) weight gain was \u226512% of initial BW (Greenwood et al., 1997) .

This finding is consistent with previous results from our laboratory, where calves fed 1 g/d of LF had lower numbers of days medicated than calves fed 0 or 10 g/d of LF (Joslin et al. 2002) . However, in the previ-Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 86, No. 4, 2003 ous study, this result was not significant, probably due to a small sample size. The results of these two studies make it apparent that the higher doses of LF are not as effective at reducing disease. Supplementing the milk replacer with 1 g/d of LF brought the total concentration of LF in the milk replacer to a concentration similar to that found in average bovine whole milk (250 mg/ml). The intestinal system of the newborn calf may be best adapted to utilizing this low level of LF to optimize health. Adding LF to milk replacer may be a way to make it more similar to milk, which may benefit the health of calves. It is clear from the results of this study that 1 g/d of supplemental LF improves health during the preweaning period. It should be noted here that the calves in this study were well-managed and generally healthy. The fact that LF improved the health of calves in a high-quality environment suggests that where conditions are less desirable, LF may be even more effective at improving health.",

In the present study, it is possible that the supplemental LF was acting as a growth factor in the small intestine of the calf. A more developed intestinal mucosa will have greater absorptive ability, allowing the calf to absorb more nutrients.

More research should be performed to further understand the mode of action of LF and its improvement in growth rates of calves. Due to the reduced occurrences of diarrhea, Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 86, No. 4, 2003 providing young calves with supplemental LF could be economically beneficial to the dairy producer, because of reduced costs for medication and labor. The reduced occurrence of diarrhea, seen in the preweaned calf, supplemented with 1 g/d of LF, is supported by the differences seen in wk 2 for fecal scores and wk 2 and 3 for number of days medicated. Based on these results, it may be beneficial for dairy producers to feed 1 g/d of LF to calves for the first 21 d of life.",

Lactoferrin could be used as a replacement for traditional antibiotics, or it could be used adjunctively with antibiotics to treat antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",
