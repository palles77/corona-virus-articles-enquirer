Outside the cell, however, nanoengineers are uncovering the many hidden talents of DNA. The DNA sequence is able to process information in biochemical assays, its structure is an ideal building material, and its folding pathway allows DNA to move and respond to its environment. Here, I review several innovative applications of designed DNA molecules, some underlying design principles and the prospects for future developments. The applications of new DNA-based technologies range from molecular diagnostics to protein purification and from therapeutics to the assembly of tiny electronic circuits. These uses exploit the properties of DNA at three levels -sequence only, structure (which depends on sequence) and folding pathways (which depend on both sequence and structure) -as the following examples show.",

            "text": "Innovative uses of DNA sequence Many uses of DNA exploit its sequence properties, along with the ability of a DNA sequence to hybridize with its complement. Following a short description of DNAsequence properties and the techniques for manipulating these molecules, I describe several applications, ranging from sensitive molecular detection to DNA computing and the assembly of nanoelectronic components. Finally, I describe some challenges and prospects for this field. DNA sequences have three major assets: a fourbase digital make-up, an ability to bind a complementary sequence with high affinity, and stability in a wide range of environmental conditions. DNA has an incredible information density -roughly 1 bit per nm 3 -that can be retrieved from an ssDNA sequence by its ability to recognize and hybridize with its complement. Hybridization is reversible and, in part, thermodynamically driven: when temperature decreases complementary ssDNA in solution tends to hybridize, and when temperature increases dsDNA tends to denature into single strands. The applications that exploit the features of DNA sequences also depend crucially on efficient technologies for the sequencing, synthesis, amplification (by PCR) and detection (by fluorescence spectroscopy and DNA microarray analysis) of DNA strands. Bio-barcode amplification allows detection of molecules, at low attomolar levels, from biological samples, such as sera or spinal fluids 8, 10 . Two types of probe are used to detect a protein target, which, in the illustration, consists of amyloid-\u03b2-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) in human cerebrospinal fluid. Tagging probes consist of a gold nanoparticle (yellow) to which an antibody for the target (blue) and complements of DNA tags (black) are attached. DNA tags (green) are then hybridized to their complements. Capture probes consist of magnetic beads (blue circles) to which antibodies (pink) are attached. On exposure to the magnetic beads, the target, ADDL, is caught on the capture probes (step 1). It is then 'sandwiched' between capture and tagging probes, by binding to antibodies on both types of probe (step 2). The resulting complexes are separated from solution using a magnetic field and washed (step 3), at which point the tags denature from their complements. The concentration of ADDL in the sample can then be estimated on the basis of the amount of tag that is released. To this end, Georganolpoulou et al. 10 used scanometric DNA detection (step 4). In this method, tag DNA is captured on a glass slide, which has been spotted with DNA strands that are complementary to part of the tag. Gold nanoparticles (Au), which contain DNA strands complementary to the remaining (unhybridized) part of the DNA tag, then sandwich the tag between a slide and nanoparticle. The nanoparticles are coated with silver (Ag), and the light intensity scattered from each spot is measured. Adapted with permission from REF. 8 ",

DNA tags are used in the highly sensitive detection of disease markers, the parallel synthesis of new compounds and the discovery of new reagents -as such, they have been applied in disease diagnosis and drug development. Two powerful principles unify the applications of DNA tags. First, new DNA codes 4 can direct the cheap and efficient parallel synthesis of large sets of polymers. In this case, each DNA tag is composed of ordered segments that specify the sequence of polymeric units of one molecule to be synthesized, just as a sequence of natural codons specifies the sequence of amino acids that make up a protein. Second, efficient methods for amplifying, sequencing and detecting DNA can be extended to new types of molecule using their attached DNA tags. Several applications of DNA tags are described next.",

Bio-barcode amplification (BCA), which has been developed by Nam and colleagues 8 , is a new streamlined method that achieves highly sensitive detection at attomolar concentrations without the need for PCR amplification. In BCA, the target protein to be detected is 'sandwiched' between two probes: a tagging probe and a capture probe (FIG. 1) . Both probes contain antibodies, which bind to the target protein such that the protein is sandwiched between the probes. Two key innovations are that many copies of a DNA tag are attached to the tagging probe, and that tags can be removed for detection purposes using a simple denaturing process. BCA has been successfully applied to the detection of prostate-specific antigen (an indicator of prostate cancer and breast cancer 8, 9 ) , amyloid-\u03b2-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs; indicators of Alzheimer disease 10 ) and interleukin 2 (a cytokine protein that is involved in inflammation and immune responses in humans 11 ). Georganopoulou and colleagues 10 quantified differences in ADDL levels in clinically realistic samples of cerebrospinal fluid that were taken from human tissue.

The ultimate goal of DNA-templated synthesis (DTS) 13 is to emulate these processes in vitro in a parallel fashion. DTS can create polymers with strong binding affinity to a target of interest, such as a disease marker or toxin (FIG. 2) . DTS offers several advantages over traditional methods for developing functional molecules, including parallelism, ease of purification and mutational evolution. Rosenbaum and Liu 14 reported the first DTS of molecules that do not have a ribose backbone, which are called peptide nucleic acids (PNAs); these are valuable substitutes for DNA in environments where the backbone of DNA is prone to degradation, such as in therapeutic uses in living cells. Gartner et al. 15 showed The starting material consists of nine types of reagent (A-I), each of which is linked to a distinct biotinylated DNA tag (indicated by a coloured strand). A set of three DNA templates, each the concatenation of three sequences that are complementary to three distinct tags, is initially synthesized. These templates represent the three macrocycles to be synthesized. Attached to each initial template is a single unit (X; a lysine derivative) that will form part of each macrocycle. The macrocycles are then synthesized in a multi-step process, in which each step increases the length of the synthesized molecule by one. In the first illustrated synthesis step, the tags attached to reagents A, B and C (yellow, green and dark pink, respectively) hybridize to each of the three templates, bringing the X unit into proximity with the A, B and C units (one per template). The units then conjugate with the X unit by amine acylation, to produce synthesized molecules of length 2. The process is repeated (synthesis steps 2 and 3) to produce three synthesized four-unit macrocycles. The biotin present on the tags allows the macrocycles to be purified by capturing them on streptavidin beads and then releasing them. Following synthesis, one macrocycle is selected for function, and its tag reveals its identity. Adapted with permission from REF ",

With the pooling method, synthesis can occur at high temperatures or with organic solvents. They reported both the synthesis of a set of 1 million peptides, each comprised of 5 amino acids, and the selection from this set of a peptide with affinity for the 3-E7 antibody, which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor.",

The purpose of parallel reaction-discovery systems is to efficiently test many pairs of reagents simultaneously in a single solution, to identify unknown binding pairs that might have innovative uses 19, 20 . This process has been hindered by the difficulty of bringing each pair of reactants to be tested into close proximity with one another while avoiding crossreactivity among pairs of reagents that are not of interest. Another challenge is to identify those pairs that do react. DNA tags solve both of these problems: the molecules to be paired have complementary regions on their tags so that they come together by hybridization, and sequencing of the tags provides the means to identify reactive pairs. As proof of principle, Kanan et al. 20 used their method to discover -from 168 combinations of reagents -that an enone could be produced by an alkyne-alkene coupling reaction in the presence of a palladium catalyst.",

In essence, computation is the process of determining an output from a list of inputs, using elementary instructions, where the available instructions depend on the context of the computation. For example, a schoolchild can determine the sum of two multiple-digit input numbers written on paper, using a sequence of single-digit additions. By contrast, a computer calculates the sum of numbers in binary format, using the principles of Boolean logic. Computation is not, however, limited to paper or silicon media. Indeed, as Adleman 21 showed (FIG. 3) , DNA is an attractive medium because of its high information density. Inputs to the Adleman computation are DNA sequences that represent candidate solutions to a computational problem. The computation repeatedly prunes out incorrect solutions, so that, ultimately, the true solution is selected. This select-and-prune process is analogous to in vitro selection, except that sequences are selected on the basis of their information content rather than their functionality. In the largest experiment so far, Braich et al. 22 reported a search-and-prune computation involving more than 1 million inputs, representing potential solutions to a problem of mathematical logic. Although this approach is not competitive with conventional computers, the work has inspired many creative approaches for DNA computation that exploit structure and folding pathways, which are described in later sections.",

DNA tags (and also tags made of PNA) offer great promise in meeting these challenges. DNA tags that are attached to CNTs can direct their assembly by binding a tag with its complement 23 . DNA strands have been used to spatially position CNTs, making it possible to assemble them into circuits 24 . In addition, ssDNA can be stretched across a surface to connect two electrodes by binding the ends of the ssDNA with complementary strands that are attached to the electrodes. Silver can then be deposited along the stretched DNA strand, to create a nanowire that connects the electrodes 25, 26 .",

In the illustrated example (simplified from the Adleman experiment), the input set contains a sample of five paths in a simple four-node network (shown on the left). Nodes are represented by short DNA strands, and paths are represented as concatenations of the corresponding node strands. The first round, which is accomplished by gel electrophoresis and shown on the right, selects paths that have exactly four nodes, therefore pruning two paths from the input sample. The second, third, fourth and fifth rounds prune out paths that do not visit node 1, 2, 3 or 4, in corresponding order (accomplished using DNA-sequence complementarity and magnetic-bead separation).

Emanating from these tiles are one or more single strands, called sticky ends, which can bind to complementary sticky ends on other tiles. Self-assembly of large structures from small tiles ensues when many tiles bind to each other.

Shih et al. 43 used this approach to construct the first rigid 3D structure, crafting an octahedron from a single long (1,669 nucleotide) strand and five shorter (30-35 nucleotide) strands. The short molecules bind so as to form appropriately placed rigid DX structures, which become edges of the octahedron. Rothemund 42 illustrated the generality of a different method, known as scaffolded origami, by constructing smiley faces, a world map and many other complex 2D patterns (FIG. 5c) . To design a pattern, Rothemund uses a computational tool Figure 5 | Exploiting DNA structure: double-crossover structures and self assembly. a | A double-crossover (DX) molecule 37 composed of two helices with strands that cross at two points, thereby creating a rigid structure. Fivenucleotide single-stranded sequences, called sticky ends, allow DX molecules to bind to each other in a programmable fashion; that is, two DX molecules bind only if they have complementary sticky ends. b | Rigid junction molecules with four emanating helices, in which each of the four branches contain a single crossover 39 .

A long scaffold strand can be laid out in rows, to cover the desired pattern. Rothemund used a 7,249-nucleotide DNA strand from the virus M13mp18 (a strand that is inexpensive to purchase). More than 200 short DNA strands (each about the length of a PCR primer) are used to hold the long scaffold strand in the desired pattern. The diagram shows how the long DNA strand is laid out to create the resulting pattern. to plan the layout of a single long DNA strand, called a scaffold strand, which fills in the desired pattern row by row -similar to laying out yarn to create a string picture. Short staple strands are then designed, which can hybridize to segments of the scaffold strand that are juxtaposed on adjacent rows, crossing over from one row to another in a manner resembling DX molecules. The staple strands therefore hold the pattern together rigidly when combined with the scaffold strand in solution.",

Techniques for the scalable assembly of rigid 2D and 3D DNA structures suffer from errors that are due to inherent limitations in the specificity of sticky ends and the control of hybridization kinetics. Error-correction techniques have the potential to rectify mistakes in the self-assembly process 55, 56 . DNA Figure 6 | Construction of a two-dimensional aperiodic lattice. Four types of double-crossover (DX) molecule, distinguished by their sticky ends (a), represent four types of tile from which a Sierpinski triangle can self-assemble (b). Tiles assemble upwards from the blue frame, starting from the position marked with the red asterisk, forming patterned rows (c). Each tile is marked with either 0 or 1 (corresponding to the sticky ends of the DX molecule) on each of its four corners, and is added to the assembly in such a way that the mark on its lower-left corner matches the mark on the adjoining tile immediately to its left in the row below it, and similarly the mark on its lower-right corner matches the mark on the adjoining tile immediately to its right in the row below it. Crucial to the success of the construction is that the two sticky ends on the lower end of a DX molecule (tile) bind cooperatively to the upper sticky ends of the two matching DX molecules (tiles) below it; a tile with just one matching sticky end is considered to be too weak to persist. Analogously, if working on a puzzle, by moving inward from one corner of the frame and ensuring that each inserted puzzle piece properly connects with two pieces already in the puzzle, mistakes can be reduced. The proof proposed by Winfree to show that DNA self-assembly is able to perform general-purpose computation builds on the classical work of Wang 82 , and relies on the cooperative binding of DNA tiles. An atomic-force microscopy image (d; courtesy of Erik Winfree, California Institute of Technology) shows a recognizable Sierpinski triangle fragment, with each error marked by a red cross.

            "text": "self-assembly of electronic components raises new research challenges, and opportunities for the design and modelling of circuit architectures 57 . Because, at present, there is limited understanding of the rules of formation of DNA tertiary structure, the development of DNA aptamers and enzymes has employed in vitro-selection methods rather than rational design. However, to develop larger DNA molecules with new binding properties, it is likely that a combination of rational design and selection will be effective. Combined approaches have already been used for the design of new RNA molecules 58 . A | A molecular beacon in which a stable hairpin structure, closed by a short helix, switches to a helix with emanating single-stranded ends on introduction of a strand that is complementary to the loop sequence of the hairpin. This change in structure separates the fluorescent label from the quencher, thereby producing a fluorescence signal. B | A folding pathway of the hybridization chain reaction 68 , the initial structure of which consists of two types of hairpin, closed by long helices. Ba | Initially, two types of sequence fold into hairpin structures. The first type, H1, has a helix formed from complementary sequences (b and b*), a hairpin loop formed by sequence c and an unpaired sequence (a) emanating from the 5\u2032 end of the helix. The second type, H2, has a similar helix with reverse polarity, but differs in its hairpin loop, which is the sequence a* complementary to a. Bb | On introduction of the target sequence (a*b*), the target binds to the unpaired 'a' region of an H1 hairpin and opens the stem through a branch migration, leaving cb* unpaired. Bc | This unpaired region then binds to and opens an H2 hairpin, exposing a new unpaired region (a*b*) on H2. This unpaired a*b* region is similar to the initial target sequence, forming the basis for a chain reaction that produces 'polymers' of alternating H1 and H2 components. C | A computation for disease diagnosis and drug delivery 71 . The inputs are all identical, consisting of a hairpin structure with a long helix, and a drug sequence encapsulated in the hairpin loop. The computation process is similar to a search-and-prune computation (FIG. 3) , except that selection steps are replaced by diagnostic tests for disease indicators (high or low levels of expression of a gene) in the environment. Each positive diagnosis causes shortening of the hairpin helices, so that the drug is released if all diagnoses are positive. Therefore, in this computation, the inputs change at each step, in contrast to the search-andprune computation of FIG. 3; this highlights the wide range of ways in which DNA-based computations can proceed. D | A device that binds and releases thrombin 72 . A DNA sequence contains the aptamer (AP, in red) for thrombin (TB, grey oval), concatenated with an additional ssDNA sequence (grey) and a fluorescence signal (green star). Addition of a blue sequence (a quencher, Q) causes the blue and grey regions to bind, ultimately disrupting the G-quartet structure of the thrombin aptamer and causing thrombin to be released. On addition of the green sequence (a remover, R), the blue and green sequences bind, displacing the black-red aptamer sequence through branch migration, and causing thrombin to be bound again. ",

            "text": "Innovative uses of DNA-folding pathways When a DNA molecule is not in its stable structure, perhaps because of a change in environmental conditions, it switches to a form that is stable in the new environment. In doing so, the molecule typically passes through a sequence of intermediate structures, called the folding pathway. The folding pathway of DNA can be put to good use in molecular detection to diagnose and respond to environmental conditions, to release energy (which can be used to drive nanoscale motors) and to execute computations. FIGURE 7 illustrates several folding-pathway (or structure-switching) scenarios. In a typical case, DNA molecules are initially bound to each other, but have some single-stranded regions. When a new DNA molecule is introduced that can bind with a single-stranded region, it can displace base pairs by a process called branch migration. This displacement can cause the potential energy trapped in loops of the initial structure to be released, thereby providing fuel for DNA devices, such as DNA tweezers 59 , and can also cause the movement of the DNA molecules. Simmel and Dittmer 60 provide a comprehensive overview of several feats of motion by DNA molecules, including unidirectional walking and movement along a track. Such devices might aid in the transport of tiny molecules in a nanoscale system. Alternatively, changes in buffer conditions, which are achieved by introducing positively charged ions, can cause a DNA helix to come apart and switch from its usual B form (in which the helix twists to the right) to the less standard Z form (in which the helix twists to the left) 61, 62 . The addition of enzymes that cleave DNA also causes a change in the environment and a corresponding change in the stable structure of the collection of DNA molecules, which could be used to detect the presence of the enzymes. The following examples highlight work that directly explores the potential for applications of nanodevices that exploit folding pathways. (FIG. 7A) are used to signal the presence of nucleic-acid pathogens and to monitor amplification by PCR 63, 64 , both in cells and in vitro. To detect a target DNA strand, the beacon initially forms a hairpin structure closed by a short helix, in which the loop sequence includes the complement of the target strand. One end of the sequence is linked to a fluorophore, whereas the other end is linked to a quencher. Binding of complement to target causes the hairpin to open, thereby separating the fluorophore and quencher, and causing a fluorescent signal to be emitted. Hamaguchi et al. 65 , and Nutiu and Li 66 showed that features of molecular beacons and DNA aptamers could be integrated to obtain devices that signal on detection of proteins. For example, by incorporating the aptamer into the hairpin of the molecular beacon, the hairpin sequence can bind to the protein target of the aptamer, so that the hairpin opens and a fluorescent signal ensues. Stojanovic et al. 67 showed that, by combining both an aptamer for a reagent and a DNA enzyme in a single strand, it is possible to bring the enzyme and reagent together, thereby catalysing a reaction and detecting the signal.",

One of the strands used in their device is the DNA aptamer for thrombin, with additional unpaired bases, called sticky ends, which do not interfere with the formation of the thrombin-binding G-quartet structure of the aptamer. This DNA aptamer is used to bind thrombin, thereby preventing it from performing other functions. To release thrombin, a second DNA strand is introduced, which binds with the sticky end of the aptamer and then displaces thrombin. A third strand can be introduced that binds with the second; this releases the thrombinbinding strand, so that it once again binds with thrombin. By alternating addition of the second and third strands, the device can repeatedly cycle between its binding and releasing functions.",
