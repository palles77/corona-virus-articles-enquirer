Infections with most enterotropic coronaviruses cause much more severe disease in neonatal animals than in older animals (1). Bang and his colleagues (2,4) showed nearly 20 years ago that certain host genes could determine the outcome of infection with MHV. The murine genes for susceptibility or resistance to MHV which they identified determine both susceptibility of the mouse to death from MHV infection and permissiveness for MHV replication of cultured peritoneal macrophages from susceptible or resistant animals. In later studies, genetically determined host resistance to MHV was also found in cultured oligodendroglial cells or hepatocytes (5,6). The molecular mechanisms for host genetic resistance to coronavirus replication have not yet been elucidated.",

The susceptibility of different mouse strains to death from MHV-3 was correlated with the ability of MHV-3 to induce MPC activity in the strains.

We found that the mice in which these ascites fluids had been prepared had been infected asymptomatically with an enterotropic strain of MHV. The ascites fluids thus contained both monoclonal anti-MHV A59 produced by the hybridoma cells and polyclonal antibodies to the enterotropic strain of MHV produced by resident B cells. We have also found anti-MHV antibody in ascites fluids elicited by hybridomas producing antibodies to non-viral antigens, when the mice had been previously exposed to MHV endemic in the animal colony.
