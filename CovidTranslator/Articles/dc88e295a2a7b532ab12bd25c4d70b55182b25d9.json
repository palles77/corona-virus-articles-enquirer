The mechanism of this kind of liver damage is not well understood. In the present study, we show that influenza-associated hepatitis occurs due to the formation of inflammatory foci that include apoptotic hepatocytes, antigen-specific CD8 \u0609 T cells, and Kupffer cells. Serum aminotransaminase levels were elevated, and both the histological and serum enzyme markers of hepatitis were increased in secondary influenza infection, consistent with a primary role for antigen-specific T cells in the pathogenesis. No virus could be detected in the liver, making this a pure example of \"collateral damage\" of the liver. Notably, removal of the Kupffer cells prevented the hepatitis. Such hepatic collateral damage may be a general consequence of expanding CD8 \u0609 T-cell populations during many extrahepatic viral infections, yielding important implications for liver pathobiology.",

However, during murine influenza infection, virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells have been detected in the liver by flow cytometry, 6 indicating that accumulation is not restricted to peptide-activated transgenic cells.

Thus, by challenging HKx31-immunized mice with PR8, we were able to study secondary CD8 \u03e9 T-cell responses in the absence of a protective antibody response, a phenomenon known as hetero-subtypic immunity. 10, 11 Here, we use this model to promote the expansion of virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells, which accumulated in the liver and triggered hepatocyte damage. Through a detailed quantitative and kinetic analysis of this phenomenon, we now provide evidence formally linking influenza-associated liver pathology to the accumulation of influenza-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells, and we show that Kupffer cells are essential in this process. Furthermore, the hepatic damage detected in the mouse model by histology and elevated transaminase levels correlated with serological data from a human influenza study. Our findings provide new insight into the etiology of liver damage during influenza infection and offer an explanation for more pronounced liver pathology in other extrahepatic infections like measles and SARS.",

However, because clinical attention is on the acute infection in the respiratory tract, the incidence of liver involvement has not been established. To formally test the association of influenza infection with liver injury, we analyzed data from a human influenza study in which volunteers were deliberately infected with influenza A/Kawasaki/86. Four of 15 (26.6%) infected individuals experienced a significant rise in ALT values. In two of these four, peak ALT levels were more than three times the upper limit of normal range ( Figure 1A ). AST values ( Figure 1B ) were clinically elevated in 20% of the infected subjects. Notably, these increases in ALT and AST levels were not coincident with pyrexia (which had resolved by day 4), demonstrating that liver damage was not linked to the innate immune response nor to virus replication. A separate study of 54 individuals experimentally infected with influenza B/Yamagata provided similar evidence of influenza-induced liver damage, with liver enzyme abnormalities in 20.3% of these subjects (data not shown). The moderate frequency of liver pathology among human subjects was not unexpected. Most adult humans are likely to have varying levels of pre-existing influenza immunity, and the presence of cross-reactive antibodies could temper the infection and liver injury.",

During a secondary PR8 infection of x31-immune animals, the CD8 \u03e9 T-cell response is both greater in magnitude and occurs earlier, 10,23-25 because of the expansion of memory T cells. Quantitative analysis of livers during the re-challenge revealed that foci began to develop on day 4 (Figure 2A, squares) , after NPspecific cells were already detectable in the draining lymph node. 13 Focal damage was notably more severe, despite the more rapidly cleared secondary virus infection (not shown). There was a close correlation between virus-specific NP \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 T-cell numbers in the lung airways ( Figure 2B , squares) and maximum number of foci in the liver (Figure 2A) , both of which increased about 2.5-fold compared with the primary infection, again supporting the view that hepatitis is driven by the CD8 \u03e9 response. In fact, significant numbers of influenza-specific T cells can be isolated from the liver at the peak of the immune response to either primary or secondary infection, as determined by NP-tetramer staining. On day 8 of primary infection, around 2.6% of liver lymphocytes are NP-tetramer \u03e9 (Figure 2C ), which translates to 1.5 \u03eb 10 5 antigen-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells. During the peak response to secondary PR8 infection, the proportion of intrahepatic NP-tetramer \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 cells rises to 7% ( Figure   2D ), about 4 \u03eb 10 5 influenza NP-specific cells. In comparison, at the site of infection, the proportion of these cells in the BAL (not shown) increases from 6% during primary infection to 18% during secondary infection (2 \u03eb 10 5 NP-specific T cells in the BAL during PR8 infection; Figure 2B ). Thus, liver injury correlates with kinetics and number of influenza-specific T cells generated during the immune response as well as with their presence in the liver.",

To determine whether virus-primed cells were actually present in foci, Thy1.1 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 OT-I T cells were adoptively transferred into na\u00efve Thy1.2 \u03e9 B6 recipients. The mice were then infected with recombinant influenza A/WSN-OVA I in which the OVA epitope SIINFEKL acts as a surrogate viral antigen, 15 causing expansion of the transferred OT-I T cells. After activation by the influenza infection, the transgenic OT-I CD8 \u03e9 T cells accumulated in the liver as seen before and made up 8% of the total liver CD8 \u03e9 T cells at the peak of the immune response ( Figure 4A ), whereas livers from uninfected transfer recipients contained 0.2% donor-derived OT-I cells. Immunohistological sections revealed that these virus-specific OT-I cells preferentially localized to the inflammatory foci ( Figure 4B ). Each focus contained a mixture of host Thy1.2 \u03e9 cells (the majority) and donor Thy1.1 \u03e9 cells. In contrast, uninfected animals that had received OT-I cells did not have intrahepatic focal lesions (although rare donor cells were scattered diffusely throughout the liver), further indicating that CD8 \u03e9 T-cell priming was necessary for focus formation.",

In fact, influ- enza-specific cells in both livers and airways of treated mice accumulated in higher proportion and greater number than in PBS controls, indicating that antigen-specific activation was not impaired by clodronate treatment. It is therefore likely that CD8 \u03e9 T cells become trapped in the liver by a largely Kupffer cell-independent mechanism, possibly via ICAM-1 or VCAM-1. 27 There was a subtle increase in the number of specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells in clodronate-treated livers, and this may reflect the interruption of some immune regulatory function in the absence of the macrophage population of the liver. Kupffer cell depletion during viral infection thus clearly demonstrates that liver damage and focus formation in influenza is strictly dependent on the presence of Kupffer cells and that instead of promoting expansion or accumulation of the CD8 \u03e9 T cells, they may participate in regulating CD8 \u03e9 T-cell numbers.",

We provide evidence that T-cell-induced collateral liver damage occurs during influenza infections; this process may manifest during other human respiratory infections or be exacerbated when combined with environmental or pharmacological hepato-toxicants. It is possible that the accumulation of pathogen-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells resulting in liver damage is a feature of responses to many nonhepatotrophic infections and could explain the idiopathic hepatitis noted in numerous acute infections such as measles 29 -31 and SARS. [32] [33] [34] In humans infected with influenza, abnormal liver function tests have been noted 1-3 but without formal investigation or description of influenza-induced hepatitis. Although only 20% of humans infected with influenza exhibited elevated liver aminotransaminase levels in the material we examined, this can be attributed to variability in pre-existing levels of immunity from past influenza infections and to genetic differences among subjects. Thus, different magnitudes of CD8 \u03e9 T-cell immune responses among human subjects could result in the disparities we see in liver damage. There are a number of factors that dictate the severity of infection and the sub- Figure 6 . Neither NK nor CD4 \u03e9 T cells are required for the induction of CD8-dependent collateral liver damage.

The data suggest that in humans, preexisting influenza immunity may modify the incidence of hepatitis and liver damage in two distinct ways. One is that high levels of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies may reduce the magnitude and incidence of successful respiratory infection and thereby reduce liver damage. Alternatively, high frequencies of cross-reactive CD8 \u03e9 T cells may produce a large CD8 \u03e9 T-cell response to the challenge infection and drive more severe liver injury. Thus, those patients who mounted the most robust CD8 \u03e9 T-cell responses to the infection, either as a result of insufficient anti-influenza antibody levels to limit infection or due to the presence of cross-reactive CD8 \u03e9 T-cell memory, would be the ones to exhibit liver injury. Therefore, the next phase of investigation is to measure antibody levels and frequencies of influenza-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the blood of patients exhibiting elevated ALTs and ASTs. Unfortunately, the variable nature of immunity to influenza in humans would be difficult to replicate in our animal models.",

The data do not support the possibility that T-cell accumulation in the liver was in response to intrahepatic viral infection. In fact, previous studies have established that MHC expression by hepatocytes is not required to trap T cells, 26, 28 although expression of MHC on bone marrow-derived cells in the liver promotes T-cell apoptosis. 37 Instead, accumulation of activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells appears to be driven by the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in hepatic sinusoids and LFA-1 and VLA-4 on activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells. 26, 27 It is interesting that the infiltrates are distributed through the liver parenchyma rather than in the periportal areas. This pattern is, however, consistent with the model we have proposed in which the high expression of integrin adhesion molecules, particularly VCAM-1, on the liver sinusoidal endothelium is responsible for the \"passive\" (ie, the antigen-independent) sequestration of activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells. 27 It is likely that the trapping of different subsets of T cells in the liver depends on different molecules; thus vascular adhesion protein-1 was recently shown to promote the recruitment of T helper-2, but not T helper-1, CD4 \u03e9 T cells to the liver during Con A-induced hepatitis. 38 However, the Con A model is difficult to interpret because Con A is a TCR ligand, but it is not clear whether this model simulates antigen-depen-dent \"active\" T-cell sequestration 27 or the antigen-independent mechanism that we envisage in the case of influenza.",

One possibility is that, despite the lack of infectious virus or viral RNA in the liver, Kupffer cells are presenting influenza antigens that reached the liver by an undefined mechanism. However, we do not think this is likely to be an important mechanism in T-cell recruitment because in secondary influenza, the infection is of shorter duration and the virus load is lower because of rapid immune control, yet the liver lesions are more florid, and the hepatocellular injury is greater. This identifies the T cells rather than antigen as the prime mover in influenzaassociated hepatitis. As for the significance of Kupffer cells, we envisage that they are recruited by already activated T cells that become sequestered by the antigen-independent mechanisms but then act as a site for the elimination of these cells, as already proposed based on experiments in an antigen-dependent model. 37 The observation that depletion of Kupffer cells leads to an increase in the number of influenza-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells in both the lung and liver is consistent with the idea that the liver regulates the supply of CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the system, perhaps by influencing their sequestration or actively promoting deletion. Kupffer cells are not casual observers of influenza-induced damage; rather, their presence in an activated state provokes the convergence of cells into foci and the generation of Councilman bodies. The mechanism promoting this activation of Kupffer cells remains in question. One possibility is that activated cytolytic CD8 \u03e9 T cells induce an activation state in Kupffer cells. Interleukin-12, tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 (TNF-\u2423), and interferon-\u2425 have been implicated in Kupffer cell activation and hepatic damage in other experimental models. 28, 40 Specifically, Kupffer cell-derived TNF-\u2423 is known to be injurious to hepatocytes in several T-celldependent acute liver damage models. 41 Kupffer cell phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies has also been shown to result in the elaboration of TNF-\u2423 and FasL, leading to hepatocyte injury. 42 One previous report using peptideinduced activation of T cells in OT-I transgenic mice showed that the absence of FasL inhibited hepatocyte damage, although those cells on which expression of FasL was important were not identified. 43 Given the critical role of Kupffer cells in the induction of collateral liver damage, we predict that Kupffer cells are the cellular source of the FasL in that model.",

During acute influenza infection in two small samples of healthy volunteers, the liver injury was always benign and transient. However, it is not clear that this would be the case in immunodeficient individuals or in anyone with pre-existing liver disease. Different strains of influenza may also vary in their capacity to cause collateral liver damage, and this is a concern as new strains arise by natural recombination. We also do not know whether chronic CD8 \u03e9 T-cell activation at an extrahepatic site could cause chronic collateral liver damage. The mechanism described here would be a candidate in the case of inflammatory hepatitides of unknown origin.",

A: Na\u00efve Thy1.1 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 OT-I T cells (5 \u03eb 10 6 ) were transferred into C57BL/6 (Thy1.2 \u03e9 ) mice that were subsequently infected with 10 3 EID 50 of influenza WSN-OVA I . On day 9 after infection, intrahepatic lymphocytes were stained with antibodies against CD8, Thy1.1, and Thy1.2 for flow cytometric analysis; plot is gated on live lymphocytes. Numbers indicate the percentage of CD8s (in parentheses, percentage of total lymphocytes) staining with indicated markers. B: Identification of virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the foci of infected mice. Frozen sections of livers from A were stained with anti-Thy1.1 showing donor OT-I cells (red), anti-Thy1.2 showing host lymphocytes (blue), and nuclear counterstain Sytox Green. C-F: Immunohistochemical analysis of individual foci during influenza infection in frozen liver sections stained with combinations of anti-CD3-FITC (green), TUNEL reagent (red), and F4/80-APC (blue), as indicated (Original magnification, \u03eb400). Cellular makeup of foci includes numerous CD8 \u03e9 T cells and Kupffer cells.",
