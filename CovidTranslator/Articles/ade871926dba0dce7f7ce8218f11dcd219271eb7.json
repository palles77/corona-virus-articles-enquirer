C3H and A2 G) the virus produces a persistent infection with neurological symptoms. In cultures of peritoneal maerophages from susceptible strains, MHV-3 replicated freely, ~dth giant cell formation. No replication was observed in macrophages from strain A mice. In. contrast to this full susceptibility or resistance, macrophage cultures from strains of mice in which persistent infections occur showed an intermediate susceptibility, as judged by the intensity of the cytopathic effect, the presence of viral antigens in the cytoplasm and levels of viral replication. Possible ways in which the intermediate susceptibility of macrophages and persistent infections might be related are discussed.",

            "text": "The susceptibility of animals to viruses is often genetically determined (1). BAnG and his colleagues have shown that the inherited capacity of the mouse macrophage to restrict virus growth is the basis of the resistance of certain strains of mice to mouse hepatitis virus type 2 (2) . Mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV-3), a closely related coronavirus (6) , has the ability to produce a very characteristic and easily recognizable cytopathic effect (CPE) in mouse macrophages by fusing them into multinucleated giant cells (5) . We have previously reported that the disease induced by intraperitoneal (IP) infection with MHV-3 is different in various strains of mice (3, 4, 7) . Mice from the A strain are fully resistant to MHV-3. They develop a mild disease and 100 per cent survive. Mice from the C57 B1, BALB/e, NZB and DBA/2 strain are fully susceptible to this virus. All infected mice of these strains develop a fulminating hepatitis and die in 4 to 8 days after infection. Animals from the A 2 G strain, and mice of C3 H strain aged more t h a n 3 months, have an i n t e r m e d i a t e susceptibility to MHV-3: most of t h e m survive the acute stage of the infection b u t become chronic virus c~rriers and develop a progressive disease which lasts for weeks or months. T h e y show signs of neurological involvem e n t especially incoordination and paralysis of one or more limbs. The neuropathological lesions in A 2 G mice are d o m i n a t e d b y a chronic choroido-ependymitis and meningitis leading to hydrocephalus a n d hydromyelia, whereas an i m m u n epathological vasculitis appears to be responsible for the central nervous system lesions in mice of the C 3 H strain (8) .",

The virus appears not to persist in vivo in maerophages, since viral antigen is found exclusively in vascular structures (C3 H strain) and in ependymal and meningeal cells (A2 G) (8) . Macrophages appear to be prime early targets after infection. We suggest that in strains of intermediate susceptibility there is enough replication in maerophages for the virus to have access to its target organs, but the replication in maerophages is slow enough to permit the appearance of an immune response. This may limit further virus replication protecting the host from acute hepatitis and death. Indeed, when C3H mice were immunosuppressed with one injection of 200 mg/kg of cyelophosphamide 24 hours before infection, they developed acute hepatitis and died (VtRELIZlE~, unpublished observation). Since maerophages are thought to be relatively resistant to immunosuppressive chemicals, it is likely that eyclophosphamide-susceptible lymphoeytes contribute to host defence against MHV-3. That resistance to mouse hepatitis virus is unlikely to be due exclusively to an inborn resistance of macrophages has already beech suggested by ALLISO~r (1). Thus maerophages from a MHV-1 resistant strain are susceptible when collected from neonatally thymeetomised adult donors. Furthermore, preliminary data in our laboratory have shown that in vitro pre-incubation with either fibroblastie or lymphocytic interferon can induce resistance to 2~IItV-3 in macrophages from susceptible strains (VI~ELIZlER, DE MA~\u00a5E~ and ALLISON, in preparation). These observations suggest that the immune response can modulate the susceptibility of macrophages to MHV-3. Further work is needed to establish whether a \"physiological cooperation\" between lymphocyte and macrophages, acting through soluble products of activated lymphocytes, are operative in host. defenee against MHV-3.",
