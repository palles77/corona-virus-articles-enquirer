Although both factors were important during the first and the largest hospital outbreak in Hong Kong, the relative importance of different routes of infection has not yet been quantified. We estimated the parameters of a novel mathematical model of hospital infection using SARS episode data. These estimates described levels of transmission between the index super-spreader, staff and patients, and were used to compare three plausible hypotheses. The broadest of the supported hypotheses ascribes the initial surge in cases to a single superspreading individual and suggests that the per capita risk of infection to patients increased approximately one month after the start of the outbreak. Our estimate for the number of cases caused by the SSE is substantially lower than the previously reported values, which were mostly based on self-reported exposure information. This discrepancy suggests that the early identification of the index case as a super-spreader might have led to biased contact tracing, resulting in too few cases being attributed to staff-to-staff transmission. We propose that in future outbreaks of SARS or other directly transmissible respiratory pathogens, simple mathematical models could be used to validate preliminary conclusions concerning the relative importance of different routes of transmission with important implications for infection control.",

There are many factors that influence the ease with which the pathogen acquires new hosts. For example, the pathogen may be viable in a number of species, but fair better in some than in others, e.g. Japanese encephalitis virus is amplified very efficiently by pigs but probably less so by smaller wild birds. Alternatively, the host population may be highly structured so that small host subgroups are infected quickly, but jumps between subgroups are more difficult, e.g. foot-and-mouth transmission between distinct farms. Although it is common for mathematical models to be used qualitatively to investigate specific hypotheses regarding alternative modes of transmission in such pathogen-host systems, it is less common (although certainly not unknown) for them to be used as models in the inferential sense to compare multiple hypotheses. Here, we treat the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in a single healthcare setting as an ecological event. We compare alternative explanations for the spread of the disease using incidence data, simple mathematical models of disease transmission and basic information theory.",

Two features of the epidemiology of SARS were used to describe the majority of the transmission that occurred. First, a very small number of individuals were able to infect large numbers of secondary cases during short episodes, while many infectious individuals infected few or no secondary cases. These episodes have been described as super-spreading events (SSE) and may have arisen from either unusual environmental transmission of the virus or true super-spreaders, i.e. individuals with extremely high levels of viral shedding (Riley et al. 2003) . Second, many SARS cases were associated with healthcare settings. This implies that nosocomial transmission, where infection events occurred within a hospital, must also have played an important role. It has been difficult to tease apart these two competing effects because many SSE also took place in hospitals. Previous studies have focused mainly on characterizing either SSE (Fang et al. 2004; Lai et al. 2004; Li et al. 2004; Liao et al. 2005) or hospital transmission (Webb et al. 2004; Lu et al. 2005; Wong & Tam 2005; Yu et al. 2005) .",

The apparent source of the outbreak was a 26-year-old man admitted on 4 March. A total of 143 cases were officially attributed to the cluster (SARS Expert Committee 2003). However, it seems likely that the identification of the index case influenced later epidemiological investigations. Lee et al. (2003) defined secondary cases as those who had had direct contact with the index case or visited his or her ward prior to isolation. Tertiary cases were defined to be household members of secondary cases. It was assumed that the use of nebulizer-based therapy for the index case might have contributed to the large number of secondary cases, which in turn motivated the broad definition of secondary cases. However, a subsequent retrospective study of a group of medical students in the hospital , some of whom were among the secondary cases, suggests that use of the nebulizer was not as important as first thought. Therefore, the relative importance of different modes of transmission remains unclear and has yet to be quantified. Below, we describe our use of a mathematical model and hospitalization episode data to quantify the relative importance of different routes of transmission in the Hospital P cluster. We tested three plausible hypotheses using variants of the mathematical model.",

We assumed that the infectivity of patients relative to staff was a P and that this was constant over time. The susceptibility of patients at time t relative to staff at time 0 was g P (t), and of staff at time t to staff at time 0 was g S (t).

These classes, E S and E P , were divided into n G subclasses, each with exponentially distributed waiting times of average duration t E /n G . The convolution of exponentials for infection subclasses was equivalent to assuming that individuals experienced gamma-distributed incubation times with mean t E and variance t 2 E =n G . We calculated the average number of secondary cases caused by one typically infectious nonsuper-spreading index case in an otherwise susceptible Table 2 . Estimated parameters. Values were obtained using approximate maximum-likelihood methods. We assumed that data arose from independent Poisson distributions for each type of infection for each day. The means of these distributions were the average daily model incidences, calculated using a deterministic version of the model. The use of this approximate likelihood function was validated by ensuring that unbiased estimates of model parameters could be recovered from data simulated with a (compartmental) stochastic version of the model. The number of parameters used to calculate the DAIC was the same as the number reported in this table, i.e. 6 for H 1 , 5 for H 2 and 8 for H 3 . As the ratio of parameters to data points was relatively high, we used the following formula: AICZK2l C 2K C 2K \u00f0K C 1\u00de=\u00f0nKK K1\u00de, where l was the log likelihood; K was the number of parameters; and n was the size of the dataset. The intervals given are based on the univariate likelihood profile. Note that, although the model was solved using a time-step of 0.1 days, we considered only integer-valued days for the duration of infectiousness of the super-spreader and for the times of intervention. In addition, due to the long time gap before the last two cases (see figure 1a) , we estimated parameter values using data only for the first 82 days of the outbreak. population for this model, R XSS 0 (see electronic supplementary material), and used this, rather than b, as the underlying transmission parameter.",

Visitors (nZ19) were excluded as it was impossible to estimate the duration of their exposure. Staff infected at Hospital P and treated elsewhere (nZ11) were excluded as their numbers were small, their dates of onset were evenly distributed over the time of the outbreak, and we wished to keep the model structure as simple as possible.

These were the underlying assumptions for H 1 that the outbreak was controlled by a reduction in the susceptibility of staff and patients (i.e. through strict adherence to personal protective measures and precautions against respiratory droplets and fomites) at some time t I .

Given that the hospital was continuously challenged with new SARS patients (figure 1b), assuming that conditions for transmission were constant is reasonable. H 2 was tested by keeping the relative susceptibility of patients and staff constant, i.e. g P (t)Zg P (0) and g S (t)Z1. Under H 2 , the basic reproductive number excluding super-spreaders R XSS 0 Z 0:660 (0.624, 0.695), which implies that, on average, conditions did not exist inside the hospital for the sustained transmission of SARS for non-superspreading patients and staff. Although estimates for R XSS 0 greater than 1 would have been surprising, given that the underlying rate of non-super-spreading transmission is constrained to be constant for the duration of the outbreak, an expected number of secondary cases of Hypothesis H 1 is that the initial surge in cases was caused by poor infection control and that the outbreak was controlled by a reduction in the susceptibility of staff and patients at some time t I . Hypothesis H 2 is that conditions for infection were constant over the duration of the outbreak and that the initial surge in cases was caused by a super-spreader. Hypothesis H 3 is that the surge in cases at the beginning was caused by a super-spreading individual and that conditions for infection also changed at some later time in the outbreak (i.e. combination of H 1 and H 2 ). (a) Staff infections (nZ164) and (b) patient infections (nZ59). 0.660 should not be considered low. The duration of infectiousness for the super-spreader was 4 days, which is consistent with the reported severe cough from 4 March to 7 March . We estimated that this superspreading index case was 76.8 times as infectious as a single infectious staff member, but that other patients were much less infectious than staff, a P Z0.112. Although H 2 appears to faithfully reproduce most of the dynamics of infections of staff and of patients (figure 2), according to our estimates of differences in the Akaike information criteria (AIC) between H 1 and H 2 , these data do not support H 2 (DAIC, table 2). The final hypothesis, H 3 , is a combination of H 1 and H 2 (table 2). We assume that the initial case was fundamentally different from the other patients (as in H 2 ) and that the susceptibility of the staff and patients either increased or decreased at some later time point t I (as in H 1 ). Since the DAIC for H 3 relative to H 1 is less than 4, both of these hypotheses are supported by the data (Burnham & Anderson 2002) . Parameters concerning the super-spreader are broadly consistent with those obtained for H 2 (table 2) . However, if a super-spreader is allowed, the most likely time for a step change in the susceptibility of staff and patients is significantly later in the course of the epidemic, at t I Z26 days: at the most likely parameter values, the model does not impose any change in transmission characteristics within the hospital before this time (note that this effect is conditional on their only being a single step change in transmission characteristics; see \u00a74). The overall strength of the intervention is lower for H 3 than for H 1 with, for H 3 , R XSS 0 Z 0:595 before day 25 and R XSS t Z 0:768 afterwards. Interestingly, the best fit under H 3 is achieved with no infectivity from non-super-spreading patients, a P Z0. The benefits of the additional model structure of H 3 can be seen graphically in figures 2b and 3c. The increase in relative susceptibility \u00f0D g P Z 4:99\u00de of patients at day 25 allows this model to reproduce the increase in cases in that group which occurred between days 30 and 40. Figure 3 shows incident cases, by infective sources, predicted by the model over the first 70 days of the outbreak. Total numbers of infections by each source are presented explicitly in table 3. As should be the case, there is good consistency between the different models in table 3. All maximum-likelihood parameter estimates attribute more infections to staff than to the superspreader. All the three models reproduce the total number of infections with reasonable accuracy.",

Therefore, in our discussion, we focus mainly on the implications of H 3 . Our results are evidence that many of the SARS infections previously attributed to the single super-spreading index case at Hospital P (Lee et al. 2003) might actually have been a result of staff-to-staff transmission. For H 3 , we estimated that 73 infections occurred between the superspreader and healthcare workers (including medical students) and patients. This is substantially lower than the 97 reported at the end of the outbreak, based on case tracing data (SARS Expert Committee 2003) .

However, if this overloading were causal, we might have expected our estimated day of intervention to have occurred later than day 25. Alternatively, there might have been a significant change in the infection control procedures unrelated to SARS admissions. We note that our estimate for the day of increased patient susceptibility is the same day that the Hospital P accident and emergency department (Hospital Authority Review Panel on the SARS Outbreak 2003) reopened.

However, using compartmental models, we were unable to reliably estimate parameters for model variants of greater complexity. For example, we would have preferred to investigate the use of multiple time points at which the impact of more than a single intervention could be assessed. When we tested the ability of this inferential framework to recover known parameter values from simulated datasets, the use of more than eight parameters led to unreliable results. Therefore, with this dataset, we were unable to refine the hypotheses using more complex model variants. Also, in using a compartmental model, we have had to aggregate information for whole groups of patients. For example, the onset dates of all staff members are known, but we were restricted here to using the average distribution of times from onset to admission in our model. Some of these limitations could be addressed using an individual-based transmission model with data augmentation for the unseen events, e.g. McBryde et al. 2006 . However, despite these potential limitations, we propose that the model structure and inferential methods used here are appropriate for identifying likely routes of transmission during the outbreak of an infectious disease in a healthcare setting. In particular, the system of inference used is generic and there is no need to construct a novel set of Markov chain updates for model variants. In addition, by using an absolute likelihood scale, it is more straightforward to compare models. Given the substantial resources employed for case and contact tracing during outbreaks, the additional use of models to choose between available hypotheses and therefore validate preliminary conclusions is warranted. The level of detail of data required for these analyses is no greater than would be gathered routinely in most instances.",

Further, if the time-scale for successful invasion is longer than in the example presented here, more time would be available for this type of analysis. For example, given the possible slow progression of influenza A H5N1 to endemicity in domestic poultry in parts of Southeast Asia (Chen et al. 2006) , if suitable incidence and husbandry data were available, similar methods could be used to assess the relative importance of transmission among and between different host species and farm types.",
