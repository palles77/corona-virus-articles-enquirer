            "text": "Purpose: Tissue samples were collected from suspected broiler flocks showing respiratory signs to identify infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), characterize emerging field strains, and study their relationships with the Massachusetts H120 strain, the only IB vaccine used in Tunisia. Samples and methods: Several IBV isolates were identified from field samples collected from flocks located in different regions in the northeast of Tunisia. The IBV isolates were characterized and compared to commonly used vaccine strains (including 793B, D274, and H120 types), other reference IBV strains from Europe, and the recently characterized Tunisian field variants TN20/00, TN200/01, and TN335/01. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing analyses of the hypervariable regions of the S1 gene were carried out. Results: Four new IBV variants were isolated during the period 2007-10 and were designated TN295/07, TN296/07, TN556/07, and TN557/07. The amino acid sequence data showed 100% similarity between TN295/07 and TN296/07, suggesting that these two isolates are identical and belong to the same genotype. Similar results were demonstrated for TN556/07 and TN557/07. Sequence identity values indicated that TN296/07 and TN556/07 share 55% amino acid homologies between each other, but are very different from the reference IBV serotypes, in particular the H120 strain. It was also shown that they have 50%-77% similarities with the Tunisian virus isolated between 2000 and 2001. Phylogenetic clustering allowed classification of these Tunisian isolates as new genotypes that are closer to TN200/01, TN335/01 Tunisian field variants, and Italy02 variant than MassH120 vaccine strain. Conclusion: S1 sequence analyses confirmed the cocirculation of H120 vaccine strain with novel IBV variants isolated from Tunisian field.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to group 3 of the genus Coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. It possesses a positive-stranded RNA genome encoding nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane glycoprotein (M), spike glycoprotein (S), and small membrane protein. The S protein is posttranslationally cleaved into S1 and S2. The S1 protein contains antigenic epitopes associated with three hypervariable regions (HVR 1, 2, and 3), and variations within S1 sequences have been used to distinguish between different IBV serotypes. 1 Avian infectious bronchitis, a worldwide-distributed disease, is associated with an acute and a highly contagious infection of poultry. 2 It causes respiratory distress, drops in egg production, and nephritis. 3 The disease has also been reported in vaccinated flocks since cross-protection among different serotypes may be unpredictable, 4 even though high-quality live and killed vaccines have been used as the primary method for controlling IBV infection in commercial chickens for many years. 5 However, high cross-protection levels were successfully reported in monitoring the disease effects using currently available vaccines. 6 Despite the development of vaccines that contribute to the control of the clinical disease, the emerging field virus variants remain a target that is difficult to monitor. Many serotypes have been described for IBV due to the nature of coronaviruses that show frequent mutations or recombinations, which easily occur in RNA viruses, leading to novel pathogenic variants. 7, 8 In most cases, the new isolates have restricted distribution and remain associated with particular geographic areas. 2, 9 In Tunisia, field variant strains were described and associated with outbreaks of respiratory disease and nephritis with rapid spread. The novel genotypes TN20/00, TN200/01, and TN335/01 were shown to be serologically and genetically very distant from the Mass H120 vaccinal strain, but closely related to the CR88121 and D274 types. 10 Despite the application of a prophylactic program, based on the H120 vaccine, the results were unsatisfactory. 11 Therefore, efforts are continually being made to identify and characterize field isolates, allowing better understanding of IBV pathogenicity for better disease control.",

In layers, mortality, egg drop, and deformed eggs were the most relevant symptoms reported. Thirty-six organ samples from these farms were collected during that period and tested for the presence of IB virus.

RT-PCR using primers amplifying the N (316 pb) and the S1 (1600 pb) genes confirmed the identity of the five IBV isolates. The isolates were further characterized by sequencing the HRV regions of S1 gene, which were compared then aligned, showing 100% amino acid sequence similarity between TN295/07 and TN296/07, isolated from different broiler flocks located in two different regions (Soliman and Jedaida, respectively). The results indicated that they are identical to each other and belong to the same genotype. Similar results were also observed for TN556/07 and TN557/07 genotypes, even though they were isolated from different areas (Tunis and Mornag, respectively). High amino acid similarity was demonstrated between TN1084/08 and Mass H120 genotypes, and the phylogeny results indicated that TN1084/08 isolate belongs to the same genetic cluster as MassH120 virus, inferring that it should be considered as the H120 vaccine strain (Figures 1 and 2) .",

However, the amino acid content of HVR subunit of TN296/07 isolate showed only 18% and 17% similarities with MassH120 and D274 vaccinal strains, respectively; while TN556/07 isolate shared 20% homology with these two reference genotypes. The results indicated that TN296/07 and TN556/07 differed from all the vaccine strains included in this study, suggesting that the Tunisian isolates were not reisolation of vaccinal virus. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis showed that 793B serotype strains (4/91 and CR88121 vaccines) are closer to the Tunisian isolates than Massachusetts H120 and D274 vaccinal strains (Figure 1 ). The comparisons of S1 gene sequences of representative strains of different serotypes isolated from several countries in North America, Europe, and Africa (Mass strain: H120; Doorn strain: D274; 793B strains: 4/91, CR88121; QX strain; Italy 02 strain; Belgium B1648 strain and TN256/07, TN556/07 isolates) showed a high degree of variation ( Figure 2 ) and differences in their S1 amino acid sequences ($25%). When compared to Italy 02 strain, the two Tunisian TN256/07, TN556/07 isolates showed the closest nucleotide (64%) and amino acid identities (#75%) ( Table 2 ). As reported by other studies, 17-20 IBV serotypes were usually shown to differ, in their S1 amino acid sequences, by only 20%-25% and as little as 3% in many cases; thus, TN296/07 and TN556/07 field isolates should be considered as different new serotypes. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed these findings and demonstrated that TN296/07 and TN556/07 isolates form a separate phylogenetic cluster more related to the local TN200/01 and TN335/01 strains (isolated in 2001) than other reference strains (Figure 1 ). S1 sequence comparisons showed significant differences in nucleotide and amino acid sequences of HVR regions of TN296/07 isolate with either TN20/00 field variant isolate (44% nucleotide and 52% amino acid identities) or TN335/01 (50% nucleotide and amino acid identities). The HVR of TN556/07 isolate also indicated considerable variability as compared to either TN20/00 (54% nucleotide and 62% amino acid identities) or TN335/01 (64% nucleotide and 72% amino acid identities) ( Table 2) deletions or insertions observed within the HVR of S1 gene sequences were associated with changes potential in glycosylation motifs and antigenic S1D and S1E sites, at amino acid positions aa 49-61 and aa 131-149 , respectively ( Figure 2 ) that may lead to important changes in the antigenicity and the degree of virulence of IBV, as reported by others. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Consequently, sequence analyses and phylogeny data confirmed the identification of two novel IBV field variant genotypes coexisting in Tunisian broiler flocks. In addition, it appears that these isolates are unique and have extensive variability in their S1 gene sequences compared to each other, to recently reported Tunisian field variants, and to other reference genotypes ( Figure 2 ).",

Besides, the region between amino acid residues 123-152 was identified as being involved in differentiating the pathogenicity of some IBV strains. 27 Therefore, because of high sequence differences between both TN296/07 and TN556/07 isolates and reference IBV strains, the newly identified genotypes may express new serotypes.
