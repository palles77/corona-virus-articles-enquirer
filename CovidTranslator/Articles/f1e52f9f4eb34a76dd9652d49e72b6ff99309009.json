Outcomes include incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV)/Epstein-Barr (EBV) viremia, development of CMV disease or post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, fatal infections, acute and chronic GVHD, time to engraftment, relapse rate, and survival. We conducted a retrospective study of all adult matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantations patients who received fludarabine/melphalan with subQ or i.v. alemtuzumab in combination with tacrolimus as part of their conditioning for unrelated donor transplantation at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center from January 1, 2012 to March 21, 2014. Alemtuzumab was administered at a total cumulative dose of 100 mg (divided over days \u00c07 to \u00c03). Forty-six patients received an unrelated donor stem cell transplantation with fludarabine/melphalan and either subQ (n \u00bc 26) or i.v. (n \u00bc 20) alemtuzumab in combination with tacrolimus. Within the evaluable population, 130 subQ and 100 i.v. alemtuzumab doses were administered. For the primary outcome, !grade 2 infusion-related reactions occurred in 11 (8%) versus 25 (25%) infusions in the subQ and i.v. cohorts, respectively (P \u00bc .001). Overall, 12 injections (9%) in the subQ arm versus 26 infusions (26%) in the i.v. arm experienced an infusion-related reaction of any grade (P \u00bc .001). There were no significant differences between the subQ and i.v. arms in rates of reactivation of CMV/EBV, development of CMV disease or post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, fatal infections, acute and chronic GVHD, relapse, or survival. Subcutaneous administration of alemtuzumab for GVHD prophylaxis was associated with fewer infusion-related reactions compared with i.v. administration in the SCT setting. Incidences of acute and chronic GVHD were similar between both arms. There was also no difference in reactivation of CMV/EBV viremia, development of CMV disease or post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, fatal infections, relapse, or survival.",

However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major cause of post-transplantation morbidity and mortality. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the CD52 antigen, which is expressed on the surface of T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, macrophages, and some dendritic cells but not on hematopoietic progenitor cells [1] . Based on previously published data, alemtuzumab-containing regimens for allogeneic stem cell transplantation have shown substantial benefit in reducing acute and particularly chronic GVHD [1, 2] , with survival rates comparable to those after similar regimens with conventional GVHD prophylaxis [3, 4] .",

On day 1, 3 mg alemtuzumab was administered by subQ injection. If well tolerated, the dose was raised to 10 mg on day 3 and then raised to the target dose of 30 mg, split into 2 injection sites (1.5 mL at each site) on day 5. The 30 mg dose was then given 3 times weekly for a maximum of 18 weeks. Prophylactic medications against first-dose reactions included an antipyretic and antihistamine, given 30 minutes before the injections. Most first dose reactions, which are frequently seen after i.v. administration of alemtuzumab, were rare or absent in this study. Transient rigor was seen in 17% of patients, fever was observed in 70% of patients, and injection site reaction was seen in 90% of patients, but there were no episodes of rash/urticaria, bronchospasm, or hypotension [13] . It appears that subQ administration induced more local injection site reactions, instead of \"flu-like\" symptoms, than i.v. administration did.

From pharmacokinetic studies undertaken in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, it is clear that the same peak levels of antibody are obtained with both i.v. and subQ administration of alemtuzumab [15, 16] .

The relatively small sample size also makes it difficult to obtain statistical significance for the secondary endpoints.

Our analysis was also limited to patients receiving a matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Larger studies are needed to assess the role of subQ alemtuzumab in all transplantation types, as well as the pharmacokinetic differences of i.v. and subQ administration, if any, as this was not the primary focus of this study. There was a difference in graft source between the i.v. and subQ cohorts, with all patients in the subQ arm receiving peripheral blood stem cells and 50% of the patients in the i.v. cohort receiving bone marrow stem cells; however, this did not result in a statistically significant increased incidence of GVHD in the subQ cohort.
