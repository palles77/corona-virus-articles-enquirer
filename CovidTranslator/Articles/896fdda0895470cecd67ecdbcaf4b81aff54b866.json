For all three antigens multiple immunizations were necessary for induction of an antibody response. Protection of chickens vaccinated with the S1 glycoprotein against virulent challenge was demonstrated by the complete absence of virus in tracheas and kidneys of vaccinated chickens. Following four immunizations with the S1 glycoprotein 71% and 86% of chickens were protected at the level of tracheas and kidneys, respectively. Three immunizations with the S1 glycoprotein protected 70% and 10% of chickens at the level of kidney and trachea, respectively. Neither the N nor the M antigen induced protection to a virulent challenge with the nephropathogenic N1/62 strain of IBV after four immunizations. Virus neutralizing, haemagglutination inhibiting and ELISA antibodies were detected in chickens immunized with the S1 glycoprotein and inactivated N1/62 virus, however there was no correlation between the presence of any of these antibodies and protection.",

IBVs induce highly contagious respiratory infections or interstitial nephritis [19] in chickens of all ages and the disease is of considerable economic importance. The disease syndrome induced by IBVs is controlled by vaccination with live attenuated vaccines, however \"vaccine breaks\" due to variant strains have often been reported. Variant strains may arise fiom vaccine viruses by mutation and/or recombination [22, 35] . The scope therefore exists for introduction of a subunit vaccine to replace live vaccination [29] .

The $1 glycoprotein of IBV has been considered to be the most likely inducer of protection. Inactivated IBV lacking the S1 glycoprotein did not induce protection in the trachea of immunized chickens whereas whole inactivated IBV protected chickens against virulent challenge [9] . However, chickens vaccinated with the purified peplomer S were not protected against virulent IBV challenge [8] . The peplomer S of murine hepatitis virus (MHV), another coronavirus, was shown to carry determinants for induction of protective immunity [11, 16, 21] . Mice immunized with the purified peplomer S, containing the $1 and $2 glycoproteins, were protected from mortalities following virulent challenge. Immunization with synthetic peptides homologous to two conserved regions in the $2 glycoprotein of the peplomer S of MHV protected mice from virulent challenge, indicating that the protective epitopes might be located on the $2 glycoprotein of the peplomer S [21, 32] . The $2 glycoprotein, which anchors the S1 glycoprotein of the peplomer to the viral membrane, may in IBV, carry also epitopes for crossreactive ELISA and weak VN antibodies [23, 24] . The region in the $2 glycoprotein inducing cross-reactive antibodies was found to be immunodominant and conserved in the majority of IBV strains and the $2 glycoprotein therefore has been suggested as a suitable for development of an IBV vaccine [24] . The role of the N and M antigens in induction of protective immunity is unknown. Hasony and Macnaughton [16] have shown that neither the N nor the M proteins of MHV induce protection in immunized mice. More recent studies have indicated that the N protein of IBV carries T-cell epitopes and that it may have a role to play in immunity and protection [-2, 3] .",

A sample from each fraction (usually 25 gl) was used in direct ELISA and SDS-PAGE to determine the titre and purity of the eluted protein. Following elution, fractions were immediately dialyzed against PBS for 24 h. Fractions with peak ELISA activity and optical density were pooled, concentrated using Centricon units (Amicon, Beverly, MA, U.S.A.) and used immediately for immunization of chickens. The amount of S1, M and N used for immunization was estimated by measuring the optical density at 280 nm using a U-2000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan) and by titration in direct ELISA. Detection limits for the purified S1, N and M proteins in direct ELISA were 10, 5 and 20pg, respectively. The protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma Chemical Co, MO, St Louis, MO, U.S.A.), 1 mg/ml, was included in all steps during purification of the N protein.",

Four chickens in each isolation unit were left uninoculated to ascertain that infection with live virus did not occur in the groups for the duration of the experiment. Just before challenge these noninoculated chickens were removed from the inoculated groups and placed together in a separate isolation unit as controls. Ten chickens in one additional group, housed separately, were immunized with 104 CDso of live N1/62 virus in 100 gl, intraocularly. Booster vaccinations of the purified S1, M and N proteins and inactivated N1/62 virus, in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (1:1), in the same amounts as used for the primary immunization, were given at approximately four weekly intervals. Chickens were bled just before each booster vaccination for collection of sera. Three separate experiments were performed. In the first experiment chickens were immunized twice with the purified S1, N and M antigens and live and inactivated N1/62 virus and challenged with 104 CDso of N1/62 virus, in 100 gl, intraocularly three weeks following the second immunization. In the second and third experiment chickens were immunized three and four times, respectively, and challenged three weeks following the last immunization. Five days after challenge, chickens were killed and trachea and kidney tissue collected.

For the peplomer S of Massachusetts 4I strain of IBV, corresponding amino acid residues are at positions 187 to 202 and 553 to 570 [22, 23] respectively. These two peptides, referred to as $1 and $2 peptides, respectively, had the following sequence: NH2-188-Lys-Ala-Val-Ser-Ala-Ala-Gly-Val-His-Phe-Lys-Ala-Gly-Gly-Pro-Isol-203-COOH and NH2-566-Asn-Cys-Pro-Tyr-Val-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Lys-Phe-Cys-Ile-Lys-Pro-Asp-Gly-Ser-Ile-583-COOH. Synthetic peptides were conjugated to diphtheria toxoid by the glutaraldehyde procedure. At the C-terminus of the S1 peptide cysteine was included to facilitate conjugation. The N-terminus of the $2 peptide was acetylated and the peptide conjugated to diphtheria toxoid via the lysine side-chain. Peptide synthesis and conjugation was performed by Chiron Mimotopes Pty.

Three weeks after two, three and four immunizations chickens were challenged with live virus to assess the degree of protection afforded by the individual purified viral antigens (Table 1) . Challenge virus was the nephropathogenic N1/62 strain of IBV. Since nephropathogenic IBVs replicate efficiently in both trachea and kidney, protection of both tissues was assessed by virus isolation. As shown in Table 1 , immunization with inactivated N1/62 was less effective than immunization with live N1/62. In chickens immunized twice with inactivated N1/62 virus there was some degree of protection for kidney (33~o) although this was not statistically significant (P ~> 0.05). Three immunizations with inactivated N1/62 virus protected 80~ and 60~ of chickens at the level of kidneys (P ~< 0.001) and tracheas (P ~< 0.01) respectively and this level of protection did not increase with further immunizations (four immunizations, Table 1 ). Kidneys were consistently better protected, 80~o versus 60~o and 75~ versus 65~ following three and four immunizations with inactivated N1/62, respectively although these differences were not statistically significant (P ~> 0.05). Vaccination with live virus totally protected kidney and trachea of all chickens (P ~< 0.001) ( Table 1) .",

The immunoattiinity purified protein that induced protection in this study was a single protein with Mr of between 94 K and 97 K which induced VN and HI antibodies, properties attributed to the S1 glycoprotein of IBV [8, 27] . The result confirmed the previous finding of Cavanagh and co-workers who have indirectly indicated that the S 1 glycoprotein might be the inducer of protective immunity in IBV-infection [9] . In MHV the $2 glycoprotein has been shown to carry epitopes which induce protective immunity [21, 32] although the same studies did not evaluate whether the S1 glycoprotein also carries such determinants. The possible involvement of the $2 glycoprotein of IBV in protection was not evaluated in this study because of the lack of MAbs directed against this glycoprotein. The immunoatfinity purified S1 was able to induce protection in 70 to 80% of vaccinated chickens, protection comparable to that induced by inactivated N1/62 virus having all four structural antigens. Protection induced by the purified S1 glycoprotein was complete and prevented replication of the challenge virus in trachea and kidney tissues which are the target organs for IBV replication. In studies performed with MHV protection from mortalities, but not prevention of virus replication, which still occurred, was taken as a measure of protection [11, 16, 21, 32] . In the development of an effective vaccine for control of IBV-infections in commercial poultry it is however necessary to completely prevent replication of a challenge virus in the trachea of chickens as IBV infection predisposes the trachea to invasion with opportunistic organisms such as E. coli resulting in debilitating respiratory disease with significant economic losses [19] .",

Contrary results have been obtained thus far regarding protection induced by the M glycoprotein.

            "text": "It is not clear to what extent the purification procedure may have affected the immunogenicity of the S1, N and M proteins in chickens. The antigenic properties of the purified S1 and N proteins were comparable with properties of the same antigens in the purified untreated virus. Both purified proteins retained the ability to react with their respective MAbs and polyclonal sera in both native and denaturated state in a similar fashion as did the S1 and N proteins in untreated virus. Changes however were detected in the properties of the purified M glycoprotein as it did not react in WB with MAb although it reacted with the same MAb in ELISA. Elution at acid pH with glycine, which was used in this study, did not alter the antigenicity of either the $1, N or M in comparison to elution at neutral pH with ammonium isothiocynate which was used in studies performed by others [11, 26] . The N and M antigens were the most and the least immunogenic, inducing ELISA antibodies after two and four immunizations, respectively. At least three immunizations with the S1 glycoprotein were necessary to induce ELISA antibodies however VN antibodies were not present at that time. In studies of Hasony and Macnaughton [16] with MHV, the peplomer S was more immunogenic than either the N or M proteins, whereas in studies of Mockett [26] the M protein of IBV, purified using ammonium isothiocyanate, was more immunogenic in rabbits than the peplomer S. The S1 glycoprotein obtained by immunoaffinity purification was less effective in inducing VN and HI antibodies than the S1 glycoprotein present in inactivated virus although a greater amount was used for immunization than that present in inactivated N1/62 virus. Three immunizations with the inactivated N1/62 induced VN and HI antibodies in 60~ of chickens whereas only 10~ of chickens immunized three times with the purified S1 glycoprotein had VN antibodies. Possibly the purification in the presence of detergents has affected the immunogenicity of the $1. Another more likely reason for the poor immunogenicity of the purified St might be the lack of association with the $2 glycoprotein, a conformation which enables a correct presentation'of antigenic sites in the S1 glycoprotein to the immune system and which is present in inactivated virus [8, 9] . The purified peplomer S of MHV, containing both the $1 and $2 glycoproteins, induced a considerable level of VN antibodies in all mice following two immunizations [11] . Only the $1 glycoprotein of the peplomer S was obtained using MAb 5-immunoadsorbent and this was the case regardless whether elution was carried out at acid or neutral pH. Contrary to that, the peplomer S of IBV and MHV containing the $1 and $2 glycoproteins, were obtained using elution at neutral pH with ammonium isothiocyanate [11, 26] . The reason for this discrepancy is not clear.",

Chickens were protected in the absence of VN and HI antibodies and conversely some chickens with circulating VN, HI and ELISA antibodies were not protected. Only in one third of chickens did the presence of VN antibodies correlate with protection. The mechanism of protection in coronavirus infection is not clear. Antibodies were implicated in protection in a number of coronavirus induced diseases. Suckling mice and piglets have been protected from development of acute disease if nursed by immunized dams [13, 17, 28] and antibody levels correlated with protection in mice immunized with the peplomer S [11, 16, 32] . Abrogation of B cells in chickens leads to more severe and longer lasting infection [10] suggestive of the role of antibodies in protection. In other studies, however, antibodies such as VN antibodies, did not correlate with protection [9, 2t] . Cell mediated immunity is generally believed to be of importance in protection against coronavirus infections. Adoptive transfer of CD4 + and CD8 + cells and virus specific T-cells prevented development of acute disease in mice [31, 37] . The N antigen of IBV, as well as the S and M antigens of murine hepatitis virus, were shown to carry T-cell epitopes [2, 25] suggestive of the involvement of cell mediated immunity in coronavirus infections.",
