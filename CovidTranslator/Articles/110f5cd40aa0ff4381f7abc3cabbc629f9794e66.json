            "text": "The soluble receptor-resistant (srr) mutants, srr7 and srr11, isolated from a murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) JHMV, have an amino acid mutation at positions 1114 (Leu to Phe) and 65 (Leu to His), respectively, in the spike (S) protein. These mutants failed to efficiently infect BHK cells expressing CEACAM1b (BHK-R2), due to their low entry into this cell line, although they infected cells expressing CEACAM1a (BHK-R1) in a manner similar to that of wild-type (wt) JHMV cl-2 (Matsuyama and Taguchi, Virology 273, [80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88][89] 2000). Following the repeated passage of these mutants through BHK-R2 cells, viruses were no longer isolated from srr11-infected cells, while two distinct mutants, srr7A and srr7B, were obtained from srr7-infected cells. Srr7A and srr7B grew 2 log10 higher than srr7 and induced fusion in BHK-R2 cells, being similar to wt virus. In addition to the amino acid change at position 1114 that stemmed from parental srr7, srr7A and srr7B had mutations around position 280, corresponding to the third region of the S1N330 receptor-binding site (S1N330-III) common to all MHV strains examined thus far. Srr7A and srr7B S proteins showed high fusogenicity in both BHK-R1 and BHK-R2 cells, like the wt virus, while srr7Aa and srr7Ba S proteins, which had mutations in S1N330-III but not at amino acid 1114, exhibited profoundly reduced fusion activity in these cell lines. These findings suggest that communication between S1N330-III and the amino acid at position 1114 is important for efficient fusion activity in BHK-R2 cells. S1N330-III is a possible region in the S1 involved in viral entry into cells.",

The major target organs of MHV are the liver, central nervous system, and intestines. The MHV virion has a genome of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of about 31 kb in length which is packaged by a nucleocapsid (N) protein of about 50 kDa within the viral envelope. The virion envelope contains an integral membrane (M) protein of 20-23 kDa, envelope (E) protein of about 8 kDa, and spike (S) protein of 170-200 kDa. Some strains of MHV have an optional protein, hemagglutinin-esterase protein (60-65 kDa) on the envelope as well.",

S1 comprises the outermost, knob-like structure of the projection, and the membrane-anchored S2, the stem-like structure beneath the knob (De Groot et al., 1987) . In the middle of S1, there is a highly variable region spanning about 150 amino acids, called the hypervariable region (HVR). A number of viruses and mutants have amino acid mutations or deletions of variable lengths in this region relative to the largest S protein of MHV-JHMV (La Monica et al., 1991; Parker et al., 1989; Taguchi et al., 1985; Wang et al., 1992) .",

            "text": "S protein has several important biological functions. The N terminal region, consisting of 330 amino acids of S1 (S1N330), is responsible for the binding to the receptor, and the receptor-binding site is formed by a conformational structure (Kubo et al., 1994) . In S1N330, there are three regions common to all MHV strains, S1N330-I, II, and III, of which I and II are involved in receptorbinding activity (Suzuki and Taguchi, 1996) , while the function of S1N330-III is not yet clarified. Amino acid Thr at position 62, located in S1N330-I, and its neighboring residues, are assumed to be particularly important for receptor-binding activity (Suzuki and Taguchi, 1996) . S protein is also involved in the viral entry into cells via fusion of the viral envelope and cell membrane (Collins et al., 1982; Taguchi et al., 1992) . Several different regions in S2 are considered critical for this fusion activity (Gallagher, 1996; Luo and Weiss, 1998; Taguchi and Shimazaki, 2000) . Cleavage events of S are not absolutely necessary for fusion activity (Stauber et al., 1993; Taguchi, 1993) , and the S protein has epitopes for neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T cells (Castro and Perlman, 1995; Flory et al., 1993) . The key to determining MHV virulence is believed to lie in the S protein (Dalziel et al., 1986; Fleming et al., 1986; Matsuyama et al., 2001; Phillip et al., 1999) , and thus, it is critical to the early events of virus infection, as well as for the host animals to protect against MHV infection (Taguchi, 1999) .",

Inefficient srr infection in BHK-R2 cells was demonstrated to be due to low fusionability, i.e., inefficient entry into cell (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2000) . From those srr mutants, we tried to isolate viruses that grow well in BHK-R2, revertants in terms of growth capability in BHK-R2 cells, to see whether any other region in the S protein compensates for the inefficient fusogenicity caused by the mutations in srr mutants.

To see whether some other amino acids can compensate for the defects caused by these mutations, we tried to isolate viruses that grow in BHK-R2 cells as efficiently as the wt virus by repeated passage of these mutants through the cell line. These mutants, 5-10 \u03eb 10 5 PFU as examined using DBT cells, were inoculated onto BHK-R2 cells and the cells were incubated for 24 h after infection. Viruses grown in cells were subjected to a subsequent cycle of infection onto BHK-R2 cells. We repeated this passage 20 times. As for srr11, syncytia ceased to form after three to four passages, and no infectious viruses were recovered from cells in the fifth to sixth passage in two independent experiments. In contrast, srr7 was successfully adapted to grow in BHK-R2 cells. During the first two to four passage levels, no remarkable syncytia were observed; however, with repeated passages, syncytia became visible that were similar to those of wt virus. After 20 passages, we isolated viruses by plaque purification using DBT cells. In two independent experiments, we obtained two different viruses, srr7A and srr7B, that grew in BHK-R2 cells more efficiently and produced larger syncytia than did the parental srr7. These viruses were detected after the 10th to 15th passage in BHK-R2 cells.",

Following infection at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.1 in BHK-R2 cells, progeny appeared in the cells at 12 h postinoculation (p.i.) irrespective of the type of viruses used. However, the titers of srr7A and srr7B grown in this cell line were about 2 log10 higher than that of parental srr7 throughout the course of infection, but slightly lower (1 in log10) than the wt cl-2 titer. All of these viruses reached a plateau at 18 to 24 h p.i. There was no significant difference in the growth kinetics in BHK-R1 cells among these viruses (Fig. 1) . We compared the size of the syncytia produced by these viruses. In BHK-R1 and BHK-R2 cells infected and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 12 to 15 h, we analyzed syncytia formed with NIH image software. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, the syncytia formed on BHK-R2 cells by srr7A and srr7B were significantly larger (P \u03fd 0.001) than those produced by srr7, but significantly smaller (P \u03fd 0.001) than those of wt virus. In contrast, there was no size difference in syncytia produced in BHK-R1 cells by srr7, srr7A, and srr7B, although these syncytia were revealed to be slightly, but significantly smaller than those produced by the wt virus (P \u03fd 0.001) (Fig. 2B ). These findings indicated that the fusogenicity of srr7A and srr7B reverted, if not perfectly, into the wt-like feature in BHK-R2 cells, but not in BHK-R1 cells, and correlated well with the growth capacity in BHK-R2 cells as shown in Fig. 1 .",

Relative to wt, these two revertants had a mutation as well at position 1114 (Leu to Phe), which stemmed from the parent srr7 (Table 1) . Mutated amino acids 286 and 278, found in srr7B and srr7A, respectively, were revealed to lie in the third common region of S1N330 (S1N330-III), consisting of amino acids 278 to 288, which was shown to be one of three conserved regions at the receptor-binding site (Suzuki and Taguchi, 1996) . The deduced sequence results suggested that amino acid mutations in S1N330-III found in both revertants are important for the phenotypic reversion of srr7 to the wt virus. They also suggested that inefficient infection of srr7 in BHK-R2 cells caused by the mutation at 1114 of the wt virus S protein could be compensated for by the additional mutation in S1N330-III.",

We have compared the fusion activity of srr7A and srr7B in BHK-R2 cells with that of srr7 and the wt cl-2. Srr7A and srr7B S genes were inserted into a pTarget vector for expression, as described in Materials and Methods. These vectors and those containing wt S and srr7 S genes were transfected into BHK-R2 or BHK-R1 cells, and their fusogenicity was examined by using recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7.3 to express T7 RNA polymerase. Transfection efficiencies of these vectors were assessed by the activity of luciferase expressed from the cotransfected plasmid. As shown in Figs. 4A and 4C, the wt S showed strong fusion activity, while srr7 S failed to induce efficient fusion in BHK-R2 cells, as reported previously (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2000) . However, both srr7A and srr7B S proteins induced fusion in BHK-R2 cells similar to that induced by the wt virus rather than to that induced by srr7 (Figs. 4A and 4C). To see which of two mutations in the srr7A S protein is important for fusion activity, we have prepared vectors containing a single mutation found in srr7A. Srr7A S with a mutation in S1N330-III alone (srr7A-330III) displayed fusion activity similar to that of the original srr7A, while srr7A S protein with a mutation at position 461 (srr7A-HVR) had lost fusion activity (Fig. 4B ), indicating that mutation in S1N330-III is responsible for fusion activity. The kinetics of fusion formation of srr7A and srr7B in BHK-R2 cells was also similar to that of wt virus; syncytia started to appear at 4 to 5 h after vTF infection and spread to most cells by 15 h. However, syncytia by srr7 were very restricted even at 15 h after infection. In contrast, all of these S proteins induced fusion extensively in BHK-R1 cells, and most cells were included into syncytia at 15 h after infection (Fig. 4A) . These results indicated that the mutation in S1N330-III enhanced the fusogenicity of the S protein, which had been impaired by a mutation at amino acid 1114. This result suggested either that the mutation in S1N330-III enhances the fusion activity independent of amino acid 1114 or that the combination of these two regions located a long distance apart is critical for sufficient fusogenicity in BHK-R2 cells. To see which is correct, we have constructed srr7A and srr7B S genes without a mutation at amino acid 1114, designated them srr7Aa and srr7Ba, respectively, and examined their fusogenicity. Srr7Aa and srr7Ba S proteins were unable to induce fusion in BHK-R2 cells as well as in BHK-R1 cells (Fig. 4A) . Inability of srr7Aa and srr7Ba S proteins to induce syncytia was revealed to be due to defects in oligomerization (data not shown). The difference in fusogenicity in BHK-R1 and BHK-R2 cells shown in Fig. 4 did not appear to result from the difference in the amounts of S proteins expressed, because, as shown in Fig. 5 , there was no apparent difference in the amounts expressed. It was noted that S2 with a mutation at amino acid 1114, as seen in srr7, srr7A, and srr7B S proteins, moved slightly faster than the S2 without mutation, although these S2 proteins did not differ in molecular weight (Fig. 5) . All of these S proteins, irrespective of their fusogenicity, were similarly oligomerized and transported onto the cytoplasmic membrane (data not shown). These results suggested that the combination of these two regions played a critical role in fusion formation rather than that the mutation in S1N330-III enhanced the fusion activity irrespective of amino acid at 1114.",

The former has a mutation in S2 and the latter in S1 (Saeki et al., 1997) . To further analyze the region in the S protein important for fusion in BHK-R2 cells, we tried to isolate the revertant viruses from those two srr mutants in terms of growth in BHK-R2. After several passages through BHK-R2 cells, srr11 could no longer be detected. Srr11 could not adapt to grow in BHK-R2 cells, which implies that Leu at position 65 mutated to His in srr11 is critical for efficient infection in BHK-R2 cells. Because this amino acid is located within S1N330-I, one of the two most important regions for receptor-binding activity in S1N330 (Kubo et al., 1994; Suzuki and Taguchi, 1996) , it could play a vital role in receptor binding. As expected, the binding of srr11 to both BHK-R1 and BHK-R2 cells was slightly reduced relative to wt and srr7 (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2000; Saeki et al., 1997) . The inability of srr11 to adapt to BHK-R2 cells might be due to this low receptor-binding capacity, or to double defects in fusogenicity and receptor binding, as shown previously (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2000; Saeki et al., 1997) .",

Srr7B had only one additional mutation in S1N330-III; however, srr7A contained two, one in S1N330-III and the other in HVR of S1. The mutation in the S1N330-III, but not that in the HVR, was revealed to be responsible for the acquisition of fusion activity by srr7A. Thus, the mutation in S1N330-III must be critical for conversion from the srr7-type virus, which is inefficient in infecting in BHK-R2 cells into the wt-like virus with efficient infection and fusion activity. However, the amino acid changes in S1N330-III alone did not enhance fusion activity, as seen for srr7Aa or srr7Ba, but a simultaneous mutation at position 1114 was inevitable. These findings strongly suggest that the combination of S1N330-III and the amino acid at 1114, presumably 1114 and its neighbors common to various MHV strains (Kunita et al., 1995; Luytjes et al., 1987; Parker et al., 1989; Taguchi et al., 1992; Yamada et al., 1997; Yamada and Yabe, 2000) , determines the fusogenic feature of the S protein.

Furthermore, this region is also conserved in three newly isolated MHVs (Kunita et al., 1995; Yamada and Yabe, 2000) , and such conservation is suggestive that S1N330-III retains some biological function critical for MHV replication. We suspected it to be involved in receptor binding, because it was located in S1N330, the receptor-binding domain. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis showed, however, that S1N330-III was the least involved in receptor-binding activity in the three conserved regions in S1N330 (Suzuki and Taguchi, 1996) . S1N330-III of srr7A and srr7B contained a mutation at positions 278 and 286, respectively, relative to the wt or srr7 S protein; nevertheless, those S proteins equally bound and infected both BHK-R1 and BHK-R2 cells. This is also suggestive that S1N330-III is not important for receptor-binding activity. One may argue that srr7A and srr7B with a mutation in S1N330-III could have receptor-binding activity due to a second mutation at 1114 in S2, suggesting the possibility that S1N330-III is important for receptor binding, but the latter is unlikely, because the binding of the S protein to the receptor takes place with S1N330 alone, without the cooperation of the S2 subunit or other parts of S1 (Kubo et al., 1994) . All of these factors could suggest that S1N330-III plays an important role not in receptor binding, but rather in viral entry into cells.",

(1999) reported that a stretch of 12 amino acids in HVR is important for fusion activity. They compared the S protein of fusion-negative MHV-2 with that of fusion-positive MHV-JHM (Schmidt et al., 1987) , and 12 amino acids deleted in MHV-2, but not in MHV-JHM, were identified as being responsible for fusion activity. However, this stretch is not important for virus entry into cells, because MHV-2 is able to infect cells. Recently, Krueger et al. (2001) reported that mutant JHMVs containing a deletion in the HVR have reduced fusion activity in MHVR-dependent and -independent infections. We also described that JHMV sp-4 virus, with a 141-amino acid deletion in the HVR, has a reduced fusion activity on DBT cells with MHVR1, which was revealed by the slightly smaller plaques relative to wt cl-2 (Matsubara et al., 1991) . Sp-4 also showed reduced fusion activity in MHVR-independent infection . However, these viruses can infect and grow in cells expressing MHVR1 with an efficiency higher than or similar to wt virus, in spite of their low fusogenicity (Kreuger et al., 2001; Taguchi et al., 1985; Matsubara et al., 1991) . This clearly indicates that HVR is not a vital region in viral entry into cells. Taken together, HVR may influence fusion activity of MHV but it does not affect the potential for virus entry into cells.",

Srr7A and srr7B, revertants in terms of infective ability to BHK-R2 cells, are able to spread to BHK cells by MHVR-independent infection (data not shown), indicating that srr7A and srr7B are reverted in terms of MHVR-independent infection as well. These findings suggest that the mechanism to infect cells with MHVR2 has some similarity to that of MHVRindependent infection.

This suggests that these two regions interact with each other and cooperatively execute fusion formation, namely viral entry into cells. How the combination of S1N330-III and amino acid 1114 determines the fusion activity was not addressed in this study. It is reported for retroviruses and other viruses that the receptor-binding protein undergoes conformational change after binding to the receptor (Damico et al., 1998; Ikeda et al., 2000) , which is an essential step for virus entry into cells, via virus-cell fusion. MHV S protein supposedly undergoes conformational change after binding to the receptor, which converts the S protein to fusion active phenotype. Reduced fusion activity of srr7 S protein in BHK-R2 cells could be due to the lack of conformational change after binding to the receptor. In contrast, the combination of these two regions in wt virus, srr7A and srr7B, may permit or promote the conformational changes of the S protein. Studies are currently in progress to examine these possibilities.",

Total RNA was isolated from those cells at 15 h after inoculation with an Isogen RNA extraction kit (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Srr7A and srr7B S cDNAs were made by reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR from isolated RNA with a pair of primers as previously described (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2000) , and the PCR products were directly sequenced (Sanger et al., 1977) . To obtain the mutant S genes for expression, the amplified DNAs were cloned into a commercial expression vector, pTarget (Promega, Madison, WI). As the S genes integrated into the vector contained some nucleotide differences relative to authentic mutant S genes, we have constructed the mutant S genes by replacing srr7 S gene with DNA fragments containing mutations specific for srr7A or srr7B. Because the wt and srr7 S genes previously constructed had three amino acid mutations (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2000) , compared to the originally reported S genes (Taguchi et al., 1992 (Taguchi et al., , 1995 , we newly prepared the vectors that contain the authentic S genes, pTargetcl-2S and pTargetsrr7S. The pTargetsrr7S plasmid harboring the srr7 S gene downstream from the T7 promoter (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2000) was cut with PfIM I at nucleotide 749 and Apa I at 1548 calculated from the first nucleotide of the S gene initiation codon. The resulting 800-bp fragment was replaced with the corresponding fragment of srr7A and srr7B. Srr7A and srr7B S genes without a mutation at amino acid 1114 were also constructed by replacing the fragment containing the mutation with the fragment of wt virus as described previously (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2000) . They were named pTargetsrr7Aa and pTargetsrr-7Ba. We constructed srr7A containing only one mutation in S1N330-III, srr7A-330III, and that with a mutation at position 465, srr7A-HVR, by exchanging the srr7 and srr7A fragments cut with Sca I. Sca I cuts pTargetsrr7 and pTargetsrr7A at two positions, one in JHMV S gene at position 2183 between two mutations found in srr7A and the other in pTarget vector at position 8412. Thus, digestion by Sca I results in two fragments; one is JHMV S gene 5\u0408 fragment containing a mutated region in S1N330-III alone (3.5 kb) and the other JHMVS 3\u0408 fragment containing mutated HVR alone (6.3 kb). Srr7A-330III S is a chimera consisting of srr7A S 5\u0408 3.5 kb and srr7 3\u0408 6.3 kb fragments. The Srr7A-HVR S gene is composed of fragments of srr7 5\u0408 3.5 kb and srr7A 3\u0408 6.3 kb. The constructed plasmids were confirmed by sequencing (Sanger et al., 1977) . S proteins of wt and mutants were expressed using recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7.3 harboring the T7 RNA polymerase gene as previously described (Saeki et al., 1997) .",

Those cells (1 \u03eb 10 7 cells) were then transfected with 10 g of pG1NT7\u2424-gal harboring \u2424-galactosidase gene downstream of the T7 promoter, kindly provided by Dr. E. Berger (Nussbaum et al., 1994) , by electroporation as described previously (Ohtsuka et al., 1996) . These cells were distributed in collagen-coated, 96-well plates (Iwaki), 5 \u03eb 10 4 cells/well, in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 h before being overlaid by effector cells. Effector cells were infected with vTF7.3 (m.o.i. \u03ed 10) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and they (10 6 cells) were transfected with 5 g of pTarget vectors containing either wt or mutant S genes together with 0.5 g of plasmid containing firefly luciferase gene pTM-luc (Aoki et al., 1998) , kindly provided by Dr. Y. Matsuura, by electroporation. The pTM-luc was used to measure the transfection efficiencies of each vector to express various S proteins. Those treated cells, 5 \u03eb 10 4 cells/well, were overlaid onto target cells prepared in 96-well plates and mixed cells were further cultured at 37\u00b0C for 6 to 8 h. The activity of \u2424-galactosidase expressed as a result of fusion of effector and target cells by expressed S protein was measured using a commercial kit (Promega, \u2424-galactosidase enzyme assay system) as recommended by manufacturer.",
