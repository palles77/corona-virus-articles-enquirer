            "text": "Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) is a newly emerging pathogenic flavivirus that has caused massive economic losses to the duck industry in China. The cellular factors required for DTMUV replication have been poorly studied. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the major intracellular proteolytic pathway, mediates diverse cellular processes, including endocytosis and signal transduction, which may be involved in the entry of virus. In the present study, we explored the interplay between DTMUV replication and the UPS in BHK-21 cells and found that treatment with proteasome inhibitor (MG132 and lactacystin) significantly decreased the DTMUV progency at the early infection stage. We further revealed that inhibition of the UPS mainly occurs on the level of viral protein expression and RNA transcription. In addition, using specific siRNAs targeting ubiquitin reduces the production of viral progeny. In the presence of MG132 the staining for the envelope protein of DTMUV was dramatically reduced in comparison with the untreated control cells. Overall, our observations reveal an important role of the UPS in multiple steps of the DTMUV infection cycle and identify the UPS as a potential drug target to modulate the impact of DTMUV infection.",

The infected ducks show a heavy drop in egg production accompanied by anorexia, antisocial behavior, diarrhea, and paralysis [3] . At necropsy, the infected ducks displayed severe ovarian hemorrhage, ovaritis and regression consistently. Enlarged spleen and leg muscle hemorrhage was occasionally found. The diseased egg-laying ducks had a significant reduction in egg production ranging from 20% to 60%, even up to 90% within 1-2 weeks post infection in some reported cases [4, 5] . Now it has a severe impact on poultry production, causing heavy economic losses in China.",

            "text": "Duck tembusu virus (DTMUV) is enveloped and approximately 50 nm in diameter, and it contains a positive single-stranded RNA genome. Its genome has 10,986 nucleotides and the typical flavivirus genome organization, which consists of three structural proteins, named capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM), envelope glycoprotein(E), as well as seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B,NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [6, 7] . The flavivirus attaches to the cell surface, mediated by the E protein, and enters into the host cells by receptormediated endocytosis. Low pH in the endosomal compartment triggers fusion of the viral and host cell membrane by structural reorganization of the E protein, which leads to the release of the nucleocapsid and viral RNA into the cytoplasm [8] . Viral RNA replication occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi-derived membranes [9] . The newly synthesized viral RNA is either packaged within progeny virion or utilized to translate viral proteins. Flaviviruses assemble within the ER to form immature particles that exhibit prM protein. Following transport through the trans-Golgi network, furin-mediated cleavage of prM to M generates mature, infectious virions that are subsequently released by exocytosis [10] .",

Protein ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification involved in several cellular functions; one of them is the delivery of the ubiquitin-tagged proteins to the proteasome for degradation. Depending on the nature of ubiquitination, this modification can modify other aspects of protein function independently of protein degradation, such as protein-protein interactions [14] and sorting of transmembrane proteins [15] .",

Generally, it is a double-edged sword in viral pathogenesis; host cells employ the UPS to degrade viral proteins to limit viral infection, meanwhile, viruses can manipulate the UPS machinery to degrade cellular restriction factors in order to facilitate viral propagation. To date, many viruses have been reported to utilize the UPS to satisfy their needs, and the UPS machinery can work in different stages of the viral life cycle, such as viral capsid uncoating [17, 18] , viral replication [19] [20] [21] , gene transcription [22, 23] , viral envelopment [24] , and viral progeny release [25, 26] .

Many viruses have exploited the UPS system to their own advantage [19, 20, 27, 29] . However, the potential roles of the UPS in duck TMUV infections remain largely uncertain. In our previous study, quantitative proteomic analysis of DTMUV-infected group indicated that some genes related to the UPS were differentially expressed during DTMUV infection, including proteasome subunit beta type-7, 26s proteasome nonatpase regulatory subunit 3 and deubiquitinating protein vcip135 [7] . These proteins were involved in different aspects of the UPS, including ubiquitination, deubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Also in the present study, free ubiquitin was found to be down regulated in the DTMUV-infected group (Fig. 1) . All of these results suggested that the UPS was involved in DTMUV replication.",

In our research, we demonstrated that the proteasome inhibitors decreased the number of viral copies through suppression of viral RNA transcription and protein expression at the early infection stage. These results are similar to those described for closely related viruses when the proteasome is inhibited [20, 29, 30] . Proteasome inhibitors reduce viral RNA synthesis and capsid protein expression of Coxsackie virus B3 infection [31] . Proteasome inhibitors block avian reovirus replication at an early stage in the viral life cycle, but do not affect entry and internalization [32] . For several other viruses, mouse hepatitis virus, influenza virus and herpes simplex virus, proteasome inhibitors have been shown to affect virus entry [27, 33] . Vaccinia virus (VV) requires proteasome activity for the complete uncoating of the viral particle [34, 35] , up to now, the mechanism by which the proteasome mediates viral uncoating occurs is unclear. To note that the particular aspects of the viral infectious cycle that influenced by proteasome inhibitors is very crucial. Nevertheless, this mechanism is different for the various viruses, so it suggested that different viruses may utilize the host UPS for various purpose, such as ubiquitin mediated degradation and/or signaling events that facilitate the establishment of a productive viral infection. Such differences in ubiquitination may also be dependent on tropism and the nature of the host cell type that is utilized in this experiment.",
