Here we studied epilepsy utilizing a genetic reference population of Collaborative Cross (CC) mice with publicly available whole genome sequences. We measured multiple epilepsy traits in 35 CC strains, and we identified novel animal models that exhibit extreme outcomes in seizure susceptibility, seizure propagation, epileptogenesis, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. We performed QTL mapping in an F2 population and identified seven novel and one previously identified loci associated with seizure sensitivity. We combined whole genome sequence and hippocampal gene expression to pinpoint biologically plausible candidate genes and candidate variants associated with seizure sensitivity. These resources provide a powerful toolbox for studying complex features of seizures and for identifying genes associated with particular seizure outcomes, and hence will facilitate the development of new therapeutic targets for epilepsy.

There are no treatments to prevent epilepsy, and roughly 30% of epilepsies are intractable to current antiepileptic medications 2 . Uncontrolled seizures also increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), a poorly understood fatal complication of epilepsy 3 . New transformative treatments could be developed by understanding the genetic associations conferring risk or protective effects. In addition to rapid expansion of epilepsy-associated gene list discovered mainly with monogenic causes of seizures, human GWAS studies of generalized epilepsy identified more than a dozen novel genome-wide significant loci and biological plausible candidate genes [4] [5] [6] . However, human GWAS approaches have had limited success in identifying risk loci associated with certain forms of epilepsy (e.g. partial epilepsy) and specific seizure outcomes (e.g. SUDEP), partially due to complex disease etiologies and underpowered sample sizes 7, 8 . Animal studies remain essential for understanding the mechanisms of epilepsy and for identifying new therapeutic targets. In particular, animal models offer phenotypic repeatability and a means to study a trait in a controlled environment, as well as providing a level of experimental testing and validation that is not ethical or possible in human subjects, such as in the case of SUDEP. Most existing animal models of complex diseases such as epilepsy are limited because they do not mirror the genetic diversity found in the human population. In order to identify novel genetic targets, a model research population with a high level of genetic variation is needed.",

Here, we used the flurothyl model to evaluate seizure-related phenotypes in a sampling of 35 CC inbred strains in addition to canonical seizure resistant (i.e. B6J) and susceptible (i.e. DBA/2J) inbred mice (Fig. 1a) . We observed wide variation (~2-fold difference) for the latency to the onset of myoclonic seizure (Myoclonic seizure threshold, MST; CC037: 320.7\u00b116.1 sec vs. CC027: 164.6\u00b18.2 sec) and generalized seizure (Generalized seizure threshold, GST; CC058: 472.7\u00b123.9 sec vs. CC031: 191.2\u00b112.9 sec). This variation extends beyond the canonically resistant and particularly beyond susceptible strains (Fig. 1b,c) .

Consistently, we observed a strong correlation of initial MST and GST (R 2 =0.825, p-value<0.001) across most CC strains as well as B6J and DBA/2J strains (Fig. 2a) . However, two CC strains, CC058 and CC032, exhibited a significant prolonged MS-GS interval compared to other strains (p-value<0.001) (Fig. 2b ). This suggests that there are shared biological processes for sensitivity for MST and GST, but these factors can be decoupled as shown in CC058 and CC032. This also raises the possibility that target genes, and thus druggable targets, can be identified that halt seizure propagation and provide protective effects to having a generalized seizure.",

Ccgss1 on chromosome 1 overlaps the Seizure susceptibility 1 (Szs1) locus which was previously identified using B6J and DBA/2J mice with consistent B6J allelic effects [33] [34] [35] . As proof of principle, we also examined whether the eight QTL identified in this study were enriched for genes associated with epilepsy in humans. We first identified human orthologs of genes within each QTL and found seven out of the eight QTL harboring nine genes in total (NKAIN3, COQ3, GABRB1, PTPRR, SLAMF1, ATP1A2, IGSF8, KCNJ10 and RAPGEF6) that are relevant to human epilepsies in EpilepsyGene database (Supplemental Table 1 ) 36 . Notably, the marker with the most significant LOD score (=6. 19) for Ccmss2 is on chromosome 5 between Gabrg1 and Gabra2. This result is consistent with a recent human GWA study of epilepsies that identified GABRA2 5 , and the fact that GABA receptors are a frequent pharmacological target for seizure sensitivity 37 .

For the purposes of this analysis, we focused on gene expression within the most significant QTL, Ccmss2/Ccgss2 on chromosome 5. Within a 3 Mb region surrounding the most significant marker, we identified 21 protein coding genes, of which 12 were measurably expressed in the hippocampus (Fig. 6a) .

The variant. An indel, rs225241970 located at 71,031,384 bp, was recently identified as a de novo deletion in B6J that significantly reduced gene expression 38 . When repaired using CRISPR-Cas9 editing, it fully restored expression of Gabra2 in B6J mice 38 . This finding is consistent with our observation on Gabra2 expression and sequence variation. We confirmed the presence of this indel variant rs225241970 in the B6J mice used for the RNA sequencing study, and observed that B6J is the only founder strain with a deletion in the 8 founder strains in the CC (Fig. 6c) . We also queried this region using the msBWT tool, and determined that the variant does not create alternative splicing of the transcript. Overall, this suggests that the intronic variant in B6J is private to that founder strain and causes a reduction in expression of Gabra2, which leads to enhanced seizure sensitivity consistent with the allelic effect for Ccmss2/Ccgss2 identified in QTL mapping (Table. 1 ).",

The limited genetic and molecular mechanistic insights, coupled with the near absence of suitable animal models of SUDEP, have hindered the development of preventions. Here we have identified four CC strains (CC003, CC008, CC009, and CC029) exhibiting high risk of death following a single episode of transient seizure otherwise nonfatal to classical inbred mouse strains.

The kindling process indicates a long-lasting plasticity of the neuronal excitability mimicking epilepsy development 45 . We found lack of kindling effects in many CC strains, including those with intermediate initial seizure susceptibility, such as CC055 and CC051, suggesting resistance to epileptogenesis is not a consequence of a floor effect of the flurothyl kindling model (Supplemental Fig. 4 ). The identification of the mouse models that exhibit resistance to epileptogenesis allows QTL mapping of F2 progenies of kindling resistant and susceptible strains, thus providing insights into the genetic mechanism of epileptogenesis and revealing druggable targets for preventive therapies.",

As expected in regions with different subspecific origin, there are high levels of genetic diversity (at least 1,310 SNP variants, 181 short indels). Within the ten exons of Gabra2, we observed five SNPs and one indel between B6J and CC027. The indel and three of the five SNPs are UTR variants have no reported evidence for changes in gene expression. The remaining two SNPs are synonymous variants.The most likely cause of gene expression variation in Gabra2 comes from an intronic",
