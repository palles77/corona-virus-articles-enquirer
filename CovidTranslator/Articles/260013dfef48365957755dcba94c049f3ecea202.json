The paper begins by outlining some of the key themes and issues in infectious diseases, highlighting the way which historical analysis challenges ideas of the 'newness' of some of these developments. It then discusses the role of risk communication to public accountability. The bulk of the paper presents an overview of developments of the Internet-based learning system through the Supercourse lectures that may prove to be a strong arm for the promotion of the latest medical information particularly to developing countries.",

The specific objectives of \"Supercourse for Zoonosis\" are to develop a set of educational materials for the control of zoonotic diseases, to disseminate them effectively via the Internet, to facilitate their use in the prevention and control of the diseases, and to promote human health while minimizing their economic impact. In the light of all these advances, it is most appropriate that all countries remain vigilant, not only with SARS, but also to all zoonotic diseases that may toll the productivity of human, animal, ecological, and economical sectors of our daily lives.",

The epidemic claimed an estimated 3.1 million (range 2.8-3.5 million) lives in 2004. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most affected region and is home to about 65% of the total number of people living with HIV worldwide (18) . Before jumping to humans an estimated 60-70 years ago (24) , perhaps through consumption of 'bush meat' from nonhuman primates, HIV-1 and HIV-2 had ample opportunity to evolve in hosts that were genetically similar to man (the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, and the sooty mangabey, Cercocebus atys). But HIV/AIDS may never have emerged had it not been for disruptions in the economic and social infrastructure in postcolonial sub-Saharan Africa. Increased travel, the movement of rural populations to large cities, urban poverty and a weakening of family structure, all these promoted sexual practices such as promiscuity and prostitution that facilitate HIV transmission (24) (25) (26) (27) . Infections in animals that are transmitted to humans (zoonoses), and those transmitted from one vertebrate to another by an arthropod vector (vector-borne diseases), have repeatedly been identified as ranking among the most important EIs (17, 18) . Viruses in these groups have co-evolved with specific rodent species whose contact with humans has increased as a result of modern environmental and human behavioral factors. Farming, the keeping of domestic pets, hunting and camping, deforestation and other types of habitat destruction all create new opportunities for such infectious agents to invade human hosts (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . Examples include the arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers (Argentine, Bolivian, Venezuelan and Lassa hemorrhagic fevers) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).",

Legionnaire's disease, first identified in 1976, is caused by Legionella pneumophilia, whose emergence as a human pathogen might not have occurred were it not for the environmental niche provided by air-conditioning systems (18) . Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli infect agricultural animals, gaining access to humans through food, milk, water or direct animal contact. Other enteric pathogens, such as the vibrios which cause classic cholera and the zoonotic protozoa Cryptosporidium parvum and Cyclospora cayetanensis (18), seem to have come from environmental or animal organisms that have adapted to human-to-human 'fecal-oral' transmission through water. Some EIs come from microorganisms that once caused familiar diseases, but which now cause new or previously uncommon diseases. Streptococcus pyogenes caused a fatal pandemic of scarlet and puerperal fevers between 1830 and 1900 (29) . Scarlet fever, then the leading cause of death in children, is now rare, but has largely been supplemented by other streptococcal complications such as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis and re-emergent rheumatic fever (31) . Streptococcus pyogenes has been studied more extensively, but the basis of severe disease emergence seems to be more complex. Many factors associated with streptococcal virulence have been identified in strains bearing the M1 surface protein as well as in other M protein strains, among them bacteriophage-encoded superantigen toxins and a protein known as sic (streptococcal inhibitor of complement), which seems to be strongly selected by human host mucosal factors. Several lines of evidence suggest that changes in streptococcal virulence reflect genetic changes associated with phage integration, large-scale chromosomal rearrangements and possibly the shuffling of virulence cassettes (clusters of genes responsible for pathogenicity), followed by rapid human spread and immune selection (31, 32) .",

Such environmental strains seem to act as reservoirs for human virulence genes and to undergo gene transfer events that lead to new strains containing further virulence gene combinations (54) .

In intervening years, shifted viruses undergo continual but less dramatic antigenic changes called 'drifts,' which allow them partially to escape human immunity raised by previously circulating influenza viruses.
