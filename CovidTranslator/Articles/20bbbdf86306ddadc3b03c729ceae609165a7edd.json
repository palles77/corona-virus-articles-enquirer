The incident dominated the U.S. news. Newscasters and media journalists analyzed every minute of the crash and the events leading up it. For at least 2 days, it appeared as if nothing else occurred in the world. In reality, a great deal was occurring, from a bloody civil war in Syria, to major economic crises in Europe, to gang murders in Chicago. Other news simply ceased to exist while the attention of the U.S. media became fixated on the crash of Asiana Flight 214, with the media paying a great deal of attention on issues of human error.",

            "text": "This chapter does not enter into the engineering details of plane crashes; however, it does examine the public's perception of what it perceives to be a danger in the skies and how these perceptions are translated into the world of tourism surety. \"Surety\" is the key word here for numerous reasons. The Western world is as dependent on air traffic for travel and commerce as the ancient world was dependent on water transportation. In other decades control of the seas and rivers meant not only control of economies, but it also transformed into military prowess. In today's world, sea travel is still necessary for commerce and often for military success, but ever since the Berlin airlift of 1948, the public has understood the importance of aviation as a military and political tool. By the 1960s, businesses became international and began working across borders and in many different countries. This internationalization meant that many businesspeople became dependent on efficient and safe air travel in order to conduct business around the world. The aviation industry also promoted air travel as a luxurious experience, and thus people could now fly with ease and comfort to their vacation spots or combine air and car travel in what was called a \"fly-drive vacation.\" In all of these areas, the public assumed that despite the fact that a person was thousands of miles above the earth, air travel was safe and efficient. Air safety became of paramount importance, especially as the world of aviation entered into the age of the jumbo jets.",

            "text": "If we distinguish security from safety, in the earlier decades security was a different issue in aviation. The hijackings of multiple planes to Cuba in the 1960s were often taken at first in a somewhat light-hearted manner. In most cases, airplanes were hijacked for a short while and the passengers and plane were soon returned. In October 2012, Patrick Weidinger, a specialist in aviation security and hijackings, called the period between 1958 and 1970 the \"golden age of hijackings.\" In 1969, there were 82 planes hijacked from the United States to Cuba. During this period, it was not clear what was to be done with hijackers or how to prevent hijacking. Although these hijackings were relatively benign, they alerted the public to the fact that not only did air travelers have to worry about the flight's safety but also about the flight's security. To add to this confusion, no one was quite sure if these were political acts, criminal acts, copycat actions, or pranks. Not only did hijackings destroy people's travel schedules, but also no one knew where the rash of hijackings would lead. This so-called Golden Age came to its conclusion in 1973 when (1) Cuba and the United States agreed that hijackers would be returned to the United States for criminal prosecution, and (2) the United States introduced the metal detector. Table 7 .1 indicates that the U.S. hijackings may have begun with political motives, but soon became vehicles for robbery and extortion. The preferred weapon of choice was a gun, but the claim that a bomb was on-board became an important new weapon. What began as an inconvenience soon turned into a very different and more deadly experience. By the 1980s, hijacking (or \"skyjacking\" as it came to be known) was no longer a mere inconvenience, but had become a deadly political weapon. A few incidents show the extent of how deadly hijacking had become.",

            "text": "The Entebbe Hijacking, June 27, 1976 On June 27, 1976, Palestinian and German terrorists hijacked an Air France plane flying from Tel Aviv to Paris via Athens with 250 passengers on-board. They diverted the plane to Entebbe, Uganda, where it came under the protection of the Ugandan President Idi Amin. He supported the hijackers with both extra troops and arms. The hijackers separated passengers who were either Jewish or Israeli and on July 1, 1976, released the non-Jewish passengers who were then flown to Paris. The crew was given the choice of leaving, but chose to stay with the plane and remaining passengers, all of whom were then transferred to an airport terminal building. On July 4, 1976, Israeli commandos attacked the Entebbe Airport and rescued most of the passengers. The death toll included 3 passengers, 20 Ugandan soldiers, all 7 hijackers, and 1 Israeli soldier. The Israeli commandos also destroyed 11 Russian MIG fighters. The remaining 97 passengers were flown to Tel Aviv. TWA Flight 847, June 14, 1985 Members of Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad hijacked TWA Flight 847 enroute from Rome to Athens and took the plane to Amman, Jordan. After murdering a U.S. naval diver, the plane was taken on an odyssey to other Arab Threaten to crash plane into building or city capitals including Algiers and Beirut. Many of the passengers were not released until the end of June. The capture of the TWA flight proved that, as a political and propaganda tool, hijacking was a very powerful instrument. It attracted a great deal of media and was a successful instrument in convincing the Israeli government to release some 700 prisoners. It would also lessen airline passengers' sense of security. Not only might they be inconvenienced, but also they might be held captive for weeks, and, in a style reminiscent of the Nazi era, people might be killed due to their nationality or religious affiliation.

These multiple acts at the same time changed the course of aviation security and demonstrated clearly to the world that a civilian aircraft could be used as a weapon of mass destruction. Prior to the attacks on September 11, most hijackings were of a limited scope, and although there were actions such as the Entebbe raids, most people did not necessarily integrate these acts of terror into their private lives. The 9/11 attacks not only demonstrated how vulnerable a major world power was to a well-coordinated hijacking used for military purposes against civilian targets, but created a major economic shock wave that impacted a great deal of the United States and world economies. The attacks demonstrated that tourism was now at the forefront of nonconventional warfare, that civilian homefront populations were highly vulnerable to attack, and that in a world of interconnected economies, such an attack could damage national economies around the world. The attacks not only resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent victims, but also further demonstrated how much both U.S. and international businesses had become dependent on the air transportation system over the last few decades.",

            "text": "There are certain goals that most hijackers have in mind when planning a hijacking, which include: \u2022 Media attention. Most hijackers do not seek financial gain, but rather seek publicity or political success for a particular cause. The old adage that \"all publicity is good publicity\" is true for hijackings. The hijacking of a plane receives wide media coverage. This coverage means that the group's cause and name now become public. From the hijackers' perspective, the longer the incident lasts, the more publicity their cause receives. \u2022 The airline industry is a major part of not only the transportation industry but also the tourism industry. In fact, anything that hurts the tourism industry also hurts a state or nation's overall economy. When terrorists hijack a plane, they not only receive media coverage, but they also cause both immediate and long-term economic loss. A terrorist hijacking may also result in loss of life. Even failed attacks produce a great amount of inconvenience for the traveling public. The case of Richard Reid, the infamous \"shoe bomber,\" serves as a perfect example. On December 22, 2001, Reid attempted to bomb American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami. The public was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks that had occurred earlier that year, and Reid was apprehended by a flight attendant and other passengers. Although Reid was arrested, he succeeded in further damaging the airline industry by causing a new policy to be implemented. Passengers in nations such as the United States were now required to remove their shoes for inspection before boarding a flight. This measure was meant to be an additional protection measure, but many airline passengers questioned if shoe removal was nothing more than a bureaucratic overreaction. It is not clear if shoe removal made air travel safer. Some scholars have attempted to measure airline security on a cost-benefit basis. In an essay titled \"Assessing the Risks, Costs and Benefits of United States Aviation Security Measures\" by Stewart and Mueller, the authors note that although the hardening of cockpit doors has proved to be cost-effective, the use of air marshals has not. Their analysis reduces hijacking to a statistical number. Such a number may have great value from an actuarial perspective, but tourism is not only about numbers. It is a business with a long after-life and often lives as much on perceptions as it does on facts. Thus, the traveling public, especially the leisure traveling public, often panics and this sense of panic may, if enough media attention is given to the incident, last for many years (Mueller & Stewart, 2008) .",

Many nations have developed both preventative and legal policies to deal with internal hijackings. Second, on the international level, hijackings can become a more complicated issue. For example, the hijacker may take the plane to a country that has no diplomatic relations with the nation of origin or is at a state of war with the latter nation. The United Nations has enacted a number of conventions and protocols to deal with hijacking and considers it an unlawful act. These acts, however, do not mean that any particular nation may choose to respect the protocols of an enemy nation, or protect its citizens. Thus, there is the potential for innocent civilians to be held as hostages or pawns. Third, the hijacking may do great harm to a nation's tourism industry, to its reputation, and to its overall economic well-being.",

After 9/11 most people understood that hijacking was an act of asymmetrical warfare. Once that perception entered into the public, governmental, and business consciousness, new rules were developed and it soon became clear that simply asking for a person's driver's license and if the passenger packed his or her own bags was not enough.",

            "text": "Experts in security use the word \"hardening\" to mean making a target less vulnerable or making it less susceptible to an attack. It should always be remembered that there is no such thing as 100% security. All life, reputations, and locations are always vulnerable and there is nothing made by human beings that cannot be destroyed. Nevertheless, experts can lessen a locale's vulnerability, and this lessening is called \"hardening.\" In the United States, airport and security professionals after the 9/11 attacks realized that they could not merely depend on passengers, but that airport terminals would have to become harder to target. To make the airports less likely targets, numerous measures have been taken around the world. Many airports were built, however, in a different era, and the airport's architecture does not lend itself easily to airport security, checkpoints, and metal detectors. Often airports need to be redesigned so as to accommodate a world that demands greater security. Airports have developed numerous ways to increase security. These include: 1. Vehicles are not permitted in close proximity of the terminal. 2. Vehicles are examined before being allowed to enter the terminal's premises. The preparking scan, however, is not easy to accomplish, as passengers normally carry baggage with them, and the opening of car trunks or the random scanning of vehicles hardens the target, but does not ensure security. Newer airports are taking into account the principles of CPTED (crime prevention through environmental design) and the CPTED offshoot TPTED (terrorism protection through environmental design). For example, many airports have found ways to remove blind spots from their security observers so that security personnel have a clear line of sight not only from the naked eye, but also via observational points and cameras. 3. The use of body scanners and metal detectors. Perhaps the most common way to protect a large part of the airport and its airplanes is through the use of mechanical devices such as body scanners and metal detectors. Certainly these machines have proved themselves effective in having found numerous weapons and other prohibited objects. Nevertheless, it should be noted that they are only as effective as the people watching the machine. Although a great many weapons have been caught, there are still too many that get past these machines. Furthermore, often airport security machine personnel demonstrate lack of motivation (or overmotivation), a poor understanding of the travel experience, and signs of both physical and mental fatigue. 4. Airport peripheral areas. Security personnel have questioned some of the security measures that governments have instituted. Although the areas beyond the security checkpoints are relatively safe, the precheckpoint areas are another matter. The same can be said for many airports where people must go to pick up luggage. Not only are many of these areas minimally guarded, but because so many security personnel have been moved into other areas of the airport, there is often no one guarding luggage as it comes off the conveyor belt. This lack of human supervision produces not only luggage that is taken by mistake, but means that luggage is open to being stolen or having a foreign object placed within it.",

On-board cargo (e.g., carry-on luggage, handbags, medical equipment) Each of these forms of cargo requires special treatment. From the tourism security perspective, the security professional must be able to enforce rules while acting in a civil and professional manner. Because tourism is such a media-covered industry, any mishandling of a passenger will almost immediately become a news item. On the other hand, the public demands full protection and does not tolerate security mistakes.",

This means that if security believes that a passenger's luggage or person may be a threat to the aircraft, other passengers, or the airport, the security professional has a right to investigate as he or she believes is necessary, or to deny boarding for that passenger. Most countries also have the following policies: 1. If the passenger refuses to cooperate, then that passenger is subject to the laws of the nation from which the aircraft is to depart. Carriers have the right to deny a passenger boarding rights should he or she not cooperate with security personnel. 2. Each nation has lists of who may perform baggage and personal examinations. The aircraft's captain always has the right to conduct further investigations even after the passenger has boarded the aircraft. There is little doubt that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) still has problems with its current system(s). In December 2008, it was announced that full-body scanners would be used at U.S. airports. The full-body scanners were not only disliked by the public, but took a great deal of time to pass through and, despite the government's assurances to the contrary, many people questioned their impact on personal health due to the fear of radiation.

Other experts note that screeners became less careful as the number of false-positives increases.

The locking of the cockpit door. 3. Additional training for all flight attendants. Being aware of what is happening on the plane may be a major deterrent. 4. Because most cargo is not passenger cargo (it is estimated that the number is well below 50%), it is important that cargo also be inspected. To ensure the plane's security, air cargo is subject to random searches and X-raying; other suggestions (some of which have been implemented) include the reinforcing of cargo holds and passenger plane airframes. A number of transportation companies have developed \"blast-proof baggage containers\" and it is rumored that EL AL now has multiple devices on board to deflect an incoming missile. It is almost impossible to write about airline safety and ignore the EL AL model. There are those people who approve and there are those who disapprove of some of EL AL's practices, but most people have come to see this model as the standard for the industry. Although there is a great deal we do not know about EL AL security, there is also a great deal that has been made public. Included in these known facts are: 1. Airport security personnel are well-educated professionals who speak at least two languages. 2. Airport and national security agencies work together and share intelligence. 3.

For example, security specialists tend to see airport check-in, security, and immigration customs lines as challenges. These lines may produce bottlenecks where orderly lines quickly melt into chaos. Airports must have a fire evacuation strategy that permits the exiting of potentially large numbers of people in areas that are not designed for two-way pedestrian passages. What is true of the public areas of an airport is also true of the airport's \"off-limit zones.\" Cargo areas are prime locales for a fire and this fire may then quickly spread to any number of locales.

Airport security specialists then need to identify all areas where a fire may break out and have a plan in place to contain the fire and evacuate large numbers of people in a minimum amount of time.

This potential hazard is especially true if the host country has wiped out the disease and its population is not immune to it. Because airlines are not only an enclosed space but also carry people from multiple nationalities the potential to transmit disease is extremely high. Furthermore, most airlines use a hub-and-wheel method for flights and this means that people from various parts of the world may be feed into one hub. Thus, the passengers on a plane may have originated in various locations. The potential for illness may begin in the host locale, pass onto one or more terminals, be carried on an airplane, and finally infect people in the receiving locale. In June 2012, CNN provided a list of the 10 top airports for spreading diseases in the United States (Table 7 .2). To add to the problem is the case of a media scare concerning a new pandemic. At least during the initial period it may not be clear where transmission is found or what the incubation period may be. Some of the airborne illnesses that have worried both medical personnel and travelers alike are: \u2022 Tuberculosis \u2022 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) \u2022 Common colds \u2022 Influenzas \u2022 Meningococcal diseases \u2022 Malaria \u2022 Dengue \u2022 Measles \u2022 Food-borne illnesses A good example of a false panic is SARS.

Another example is the 2006 outbreaks of avian (bird) flu (H5N1) in various nations around the world. These outbreaks caught the tourism industry's attention. Despite the great amount of publicity given to avian flu, it is important to note that as of this writing there have been less than 700 people so far who have contracted the disease.",

Although the media was a major component in scaring the public, reality proved to be different than what was stated on television. The tourism security officer then needs to be aware of not only the facts but also the perception of the facts as presented in the media. As a tourism security specialist you need to know that: \u2022 Tourism is highly vulnerable to a panic situation. The days after 9/11 ought to have retaught the tourism industry that for most people travel is a leisure purchase based on want rather than need. If travelers become afraid they may simply cancel their trips. In such cases, there may be massive layoffs of tourism workers. \u2022 You must be prepared to take care of sick employees and their families. The people staffing the tourism industry are also human. That means that their families and they are also susceptible to illnesses. Should large numbers of staff (or their families) become sick, hotels and restaurants may have 183 Transportation to close simply due to manpower shortages. Tourism industry people need to develop plans on how they will maintain their industry while suffering from manpower shortages. \u2022 Security personnel must be prepared to take care of visitors who fall ill and may not know how to contact local medical authorities or even speak the language of the local doctors. Another problem to be considered is how the tourism industry will aid people who fall sick while on vacation. Medical notices will need to be distributed in multiple languages; people will need ways to communicate to loved ones and to describe symptoms to medical personnel in their own language. \u2022 Security personnel must be prepared to fight against a pandemic not only from the medical perspective, but also from the marketing/information perspective. Because the public may well panic it is important that the tourism industry be prepared to offer concrete and credible information. This information should be given to the public almost immediately. Every tourism office should have an information plan ready should a pandemic occur in its area. Develop creative Websites so that people can gain information any time of the day and without regard to where they may be located. \u2022 Security personnel must be prepared to counter negative publicity with an action program. For example, in areas that have been impacted by a disease, make sure to advise travelers to stay current with their vaccinations and create medical information sheets. It is essential that the public know where to go for information, as well as what is true versus what is false. For travelers who may not be up-to-date with current shots, offer lists of doctors and clinics willing to accept traveler's insurance. \u2022 An up-to-date first-aid kit and proper preventative procedures at hotels and other places of lodging. For example, make sure that employees use antibacterial hand wipes and encourage hotels to provide these for travelers. \u2022 Security personnel must be prepared to work with travel insurance companies. In case of a pandemic, travelers may not receive value for money and may desire to either cancel a trip or cut it short. The best way to maintain good will is by working with such organizations as the United States Travel Industry Association (in Canada, it is called Travel and Health Industry Association of Canada). Develop travel health programs with these organizations so that visitors feel financially protected. \u2022 Be prepared to work with the media. A pandemic is like any other tourism crisis and should be treated as such. Prepare for it before it strikes. If it should occur, set your action plan in place and make sure that you work 184 Tourism Security with the media. Finally, have a recovery plan set so that once the crisis has abated you can begin a financial recovery program. The bottom line is that air travel may not produce illnesses, but the transfer of large numbers of people from one place to the next may be a source of worry not only for medical authorities, but also for tourism security professionals.",

Even good clinicians rarely have the knowledge to diagnose and treat exotic tropical diseases. Until a month ago, our attention was focused on Asia-the source of the last two influenza pandemics, in 1957 and 1968-as the likely source for the next one. And yet it appeared in Mexico while we weren't looking. The tourism industry is particularly vulnerable to biological warfare, especially in the form of contagious illnesses such as smallpox. Because tourism is a peacetime and often leisure industry, it can become the perfect undercover delivery system. Here are just a few reasons for this: 1. Traveling today, especially in a world with limited visa restrictions, is relatively easy. 2. Airports are hubs with thousands of people going to any number of places.

Not only was there the problem of derailments and other mechanical breakdowns, but there were also issues of attacks by \"hostile\" natives and by robbers.

Although it will take some time to know all of the facts, as of this writing, we know that at least 79 people died when the train derailed. The train's conductor has pled guilty to having spoken on a cell phone while taking a major curve at a speed well above what the law permitted. It is clear from the evidence given that human error caused the crash. The victims came from numerous nations around the world, and to quote one news source: \"The crash has cast a pall over the town, a Catholic pilgrimage site. Santiago officials had been preparing for the religious feast of St. James of Compostela, Spain's patron saint, the day after the crash, but canceled it and turned a local sporting arena into a morgue\" (\"Driver in Spain train crash,\" 2013, para. 23).",

Motor coaches, however, are both similar and different from other forms of tourism transportation for the following reasons: 1. They tend to have either affinity groups or groups that become affinity groups. That is, they do not accept passenger traffic along the way. 2. Unlike cruises, they provide lodging and food in other accommodations such as hotels or motels. 3. There tends to be a relationship between the driver and the passengers. 4. Baggage may be taken off the bus at every overnight stop. 5. Like the tour bus, their goal is the visitation of specific sites, but unlike the tour bus, the drivers tend to develop a relationship with the passengers over time, and the travel duration is much more than a day.
