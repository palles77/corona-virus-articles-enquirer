Until the ecological factors associated with zoonoses are better understood, disease emergence will continue. For Lyme disease, disease suppression has been demonstrated by a dilution effect, whereby increasing species diversity decreases disease prevalence in host populations. To test the dilution effect in another disease, we examined 17 ecological variables associated with prevalence of the directly transmitted Sin Nombre virus (genus Hantavirus, etiologic agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) in its wildlife host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Only species diversity was statistically linked to infection prevalence: as species diversity decreased, infection prevalence increased. The increase was moderate, but prevalence increased exponentially at low levels of diversity, a phenomenon described as zoonotic release. The results suggest that species diversity affects disease emergence.",

Of these emerging infectious diseases, 62% are zoonotic (2) , meaning they are naturally hosted by, and persist in, wildlife but also affect human populations. The ecological factors associated with zoonotic disease emergence are likely complex and are poorly understood. Most often, because of limited time, resources, and the exigencies of the situation, outbreak investigations of emerging diseases seek only to discover the pathogen responsible for the disease in humans. But ecological studies are of critical importance to long-term containment of zoonotic disease emergence; they are the only way to ascertain the wildlife source of the disease, the dynamics of the host-pathogen relationship, and the ecological factors associated with an outbreak. Knowledge of all these factors is needed to proactively protect the public from zoonotic diseases; without this knowledge, new diseases will continue to emerge. The worldwide distribution of these largely zoonotic diseases suggests a globally distributed mechanism for their emergence.",

Since their initial discovery in the Western Hemisphere in 1982, several dozen hantavirus strains have been found, each hosted by a unique rodent species (9); novel hantaviruses have recently been discovered in shrews (10, 11) . Natural hosts are asymptomatic and chronically infected; intraspecies spread is hypothesized to be through bites (12) . Humans become infected with hantavirus by inhaling aerosolized excreta from infected rodents (13) . Occasionally hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (14) develops; this syndrome has a mortality rate of almost 40% and no prophylaxis, treatment, or cure (15) . Most of the 506 confirmed cases in the United States have been caused by Sin Nombre virus (SNV). Studies have found that low diversity ecosystems dominated by the rodent hosts for 3 distinct hantaviruses had high infection prevalence in the host (16, 17) , suggesting a role for species diversity. Although the mechanism of disease dilution would differ in directly transmitted zoonoses (e.g., hantaviruses), as opposed to vector-borne diseases, a dilution effect could occur if 1) individuals of the host species remain as species diversity decreases, 2) the disease is spread within the host species through direct encounters (such as biting), and 3) presence of other species causes encounters among the host species to decrease.",

Logistic regression with binomial errors was initially used to assess the association between infection prevalence and deer mouse density and species diversity. However, the resulting models showed such extensive overdispersion that we considered logistic regression to be an unsuitable statistical method for these data (32) . Accordingly, we used nonlinear regression analysis.",

If, as hypothesized, transmission were through aggressive encounters (12) , SNV would spread most efficiently in an ecosystem composed solely of deer mice, where every encounter would be a potential disease-transmitting encounter. As more spe-cies, and more individuals within those species, are added to the community, the number of potential disease-transmitting encounters decreases because species other than deer mice are nonhost (not competent, or nonamplifying) species. This type of decreased intraspecies interaction has been termed \"encounter reduction\" (34) and would occur if increasing species diversity increases the number of competitors in an ecosystem, thereby increasing the amount of time a host species has to spend securing limited resources (food, nest sites), in turn decreasing the time spent on intraspecies encounters.",

            "text": "An increase in species diversity, in combination with an increase in the densities of individuals within those species, as we observed in this study, should also mean an increase in the number of predators of the rodent host species. It is reasonable to hypothesize that predators keep rodent numbers under control, in turn limiting pathogen spread both among rodents and into human populations, although it has been difficult to empirically support this hypothesis (35) . Our results suggest that predators control infection prevalence not by controlling the density of host species but instead by an unrelated mechanism, possibly encounter reduction. When predators are present in the ecosystem, host species should spend more time in the nest, in hiding, or within the familiarity of their territory, all to avoid predation and all likely to decrease intraspecies encounters. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that capture ratebut not density-was highest at site 1 during year 2 relative to all other parks (p<0.01), which means that deer mice were moving about and encountering traps more often. We hypothesize that when predation and competition are decreased or absent, for this small mammal community at a Simpson diversity index \u22480.43, a zoonotic release of predatory and competitive controls appears to have occurred, in which SNV infection prevalence increased drastically. This hypothesis would account for the lack of differences in infection prevalence rates at sites 2-5; although the Simpson index for these sites varied significantly; the threshold for zoonotic release had not been breached at any of those sites. Above the threshold level, sites would maintain a low level of infection, or perhaps locally lose infection altogether. In this study, SNV infection prevalence was either so low during some seasons at some sites as to be virtually undetectable by traditional trapping techniques or ephemerally absent. In particular, SNV was undetected or absent most often at the most diverse site (no SNV was detected in 8 of 12 seasons at site 5, in 6-7 seasons at sites 2-4, and in 1 season at site 1). Our system differs from the Lyme disease system, which depends on a vector that is not host specific (black-legged tick) to transmit the disease. Here, in contrast, presence of nonhost species in the small mammal community will not directly affect the transmission of SNV; instead, the behavior of members of the natural host species will be affected, decreasing SNV transmission rates among competent hosts through encounter reduction. Increased diversity in both the Lyme disease and SNV systems appears to lead to decreased disease prevalence, although the mechanisms differ. Another difference between the 2 systems is the threshold relationship between species diversity and SNV prevalence, which suggests that the shape of the dilution curve may be mechanism dependent and is the reason we proposed the term \"zoonotic release.\" Given that many hantaviruses are hosted by generalist rodent species (i.e., those able to exploit a broad variety of ecological resources) that dominate ecosystems as species diversity decreases (e. Host density should likewise be considered a factor in this phenomenon because density increased before infection prevalence increased. However, the result of the logistic regression between density and infection prevalence, although significant, was marked by considerable overdispersion, suggesting that this was the wrong model, and its significance was greatly overestimated (32) . Additionally, at all parks deer mouse density increased but infection prevalence did not, clearly indicating that density is not the sole driver of infection prevalence in this system. A logistic regression with both density and mammal species diversity in the model showed similar overdispersion. Our results suggest that dependence on both density and frequency play a role in SNV transmission, which may be one of the reasons it has been so hard to determine their respective roles in the transmission of hantaviruses (36) . More extensive studies should therefore be undertaken wherein species diversity, density, and frequency of encounters are carefully measured to determine their respective roles in disease transmission.",

The toll in illness and death from emerging zoonotic diseases is high, and outbreak investigations are costly (37) . These investigations often fail to identify the source of a pathogen, let alone answer the question of why an outbreak occurred at a given time and place. If the host species or vector is found, eradication usually is neither possible nor desirable, particularly when the species are as ubiquitous as deer mice. Prophylaxis is difficult when transmission is airborne, as in hantaviruses, for which potentially everyone in a region is at risk. Ecosystem-level control may be the best way to protect the public from the increasing threat of many zoonotic diseases. Wildlife also are at risk for infection with novel pathogens, and the factors underlying wildlife disease emergence are similar to those in humans (38) ; a dilution effect may therefore help protect wildlife as well. For example, a study of West Nile virus suggested that increased bird species richness depressed the prevalence of the virus in ecosystems (39) . Thus, wildlife could be protected in 2 ways: first, from dilution of diseases that are potentially harmful to them and second, from maintenance of healthy ecosystems.",
