These enzymes play an integral role in assimilating the major food components: proteins, lipids and carbohydrates.Pancreatic enzymes increase the efficiency of breakdown of macromolecules in the digestive tract and enhance the transport mechanisms for sugars, amino acids and fatty acids. Thus, food substances are inefficiently broken down and cannot be readily transported across the intestinal lumen without pancreatic enzymes.Diarrhea occurs due to the presence of large quantities of fats, protein and carbohydrates, which are osmotic.Maldigestion of these important nutrients leads to weight loss and may also cause deficiencies of vitamins, fatty acids or other essential nutrients.",
