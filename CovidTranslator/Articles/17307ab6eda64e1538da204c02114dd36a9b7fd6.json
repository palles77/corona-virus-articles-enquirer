A systematic profiling of the immune vulnerability landscape of SARS-CoV-2, which can bring critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism, peptide vaccine development, and antiviral antibody development, is lacking. In this study, we investigated the potential of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins to induce class I and II MHC presentation and to form linear antibody epitopes. We created an online database to broadly share the predictions as a resource for the research community. Using this resource, we showed that genetic variations in SARS-CoV-2, though still few for the moment, already follow the pattern of mutations in related coronaviruses, and could alter the immune vulnerability landscape of this virus. Importantly, we discovered evidence that SARS-CoV-2, along with related coronaviruses, used mutations to evade attack from the human immune system. Overall, we present an immunological resource for SARS-CoV-2 that could promote both therapeutic development and mechanistic research. : bioRxiv preprint Chinese and European populations.

Such analyses could also inform antiviral immuno-therapeutic development, which can be either T cell-based or B cell-based. Antibodies can neutralize viral infectivity in a number of ways, such as interfering with binding to receptors, blocking uptake into cells, etc. For SARS-CoV, the human ACE-2 protein is the functional receptor, and anti-ACE2 antibody can block viral replication (8) . On the other hand, previous studies have indicated a crucial role of both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells in SARS-CoV clearance (9, 10), while Janice Oh et al also observed that development of SARS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies requires CD4 + T helper cells (9) . In fact, there are examples of vaccines for influenza that contain both antibody and T cell inducing components (11, 12) .",

The counts of the MHC binders were weighted by the allele frequencies of the Chinese population (15) , since most, if not all, samples analyzed in this study were obtained from Chinese patients. We found that there are a small number of genomic regions that showed high peaks of immunogenicity corresponding to a large number of MHC binders in a small neighborhood, which could be better potential vaccine targets (Sup. Table 1 ). The MHC binding peptide profiles of a different racial population, i.e. European ancestry (16) , are shown in Sup. Fig. 1 . Interestingly, the total T cell epitope intensities, calculated as the sum of the number of binders weighted by allele frequency, are slightly higher in the European population than the Chinese population ( Fig. 1b and individual alleles shown in Sup. Fig. 2) , which indicates that different susceptibility to this virus may exist between differential populations. The above analyses were performed for the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The viral strains that have been sampled and sequenced so far are highly similar to each other overall, with a segment of multiple alignment shown in Sup. Fig. 3 .",

We focused on linear epitopes, rather than conformational epitopes, because linear epitopes are more suitable for vaccine design (18, 19) and bioinformatics predictions are more feasible. Similar to T cell epitopes, contiguous stretches of >10 epitope-encoding residues, which are more representative of the usual length of B cell epitopes, are located in small genomic regions (red bars in Fig. 1c , and Sup. Table 2 ). We also focused on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which attaches to the ACE-2 protein for entry into the human cell (20) . We used BLAST to align the RBM sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with that of SARS-CoV, and found there is a relatively poor conservation between the two S proteins (Fig. 1d) . This was supported by Wrapp et al (5) , which reports no binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBM by any of the three SARS-CoV RBMdirected antibodies. Therefore, antibody-based therapeutic design should start with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein de novo.",

However, in SARS-CoV-2, the genomic regions with higher mutational rates can already be discerned (Fig. 2a) , which are roughly 0-9kb and 21kb-30kb, and they largely overlap with the highly mutated regions of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 2bc) .

We examined individual mutations in each SARV-CoV-2 isolate with respect to the reference genome. We predicted the T cell epitopes and B cell epitopes that would be lost and gained due to the mutations in each strain. For T cell epitopes, we take a sum of the lost/gained epitopes weighted by the Chinese HLA allele frequency, to generate an overall \"lost\" immunogenicity score, and an overall \"gained\" immunogenicity score. Fig. 2d (CD8 + T epitopes) and Fig. 2e (CD4 + T epitopes) show that the gained and lost immunogenicity scores are very comparable for most strains, which is just an effect of random change in the epitope profiles due to mutations. But strikingly, the strains that showed a large difference in the lost and gained immunogenicity almost all have dramatic net loss, rather than net gain, of immunogenicity ( Fig. 2d and 2e) . Similarly, we calculated the number of amino acid residues that could encode B cell epitopes predicted from the protein sequences of each SARS-CoV-2 strain (Fig. 2f) , and also found that there is an overall decrease of the number of B cell epitopes in the isolates compared with the reference genome (Pval=0.001). We limited this analysis to amino acid residues in stretches of >10 epitope-encoding residues, and made the same observation (Pval=0.038, Sup. Fig. 4a) . Furthermore, we grouped the SARS-CoV-2 strains by their collection times in Dec/2019, Jan/2020, and Feb/2020, and compared the changes in T cell and B cell immunogenicity (Sup. Fig. 5) . We confirmed the latter appearing strains are indeed less immunogenic than earlier strains. Taken together, these observations show that the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is subject to immune pressure, and SARS-CoV-2 may be using this mechanism to evade immune surveillance by the host.",

To further corroborate our observation, we performed the same analyses for SARS-CoV (Fig. 2g-i and Sup. Fig. 4b ) and MERS-CoV (Fig. 2j-l and Sup. Fig.  4c) . We observed similar phenomena that the viral strains with large immunogenicity changes almost all have net loss, rather than net gain, of immunogenicity, for both T cell epitopes and B cell epitopes. This suggests that the immune pressure-induced genetic drifts are common to coronaviruses during human circulation, and further supports our conjecture that future genetic drifts can happen in SARS-CoV-2 under this mechanism.",

Similar to a previous report (17) , we also found that the amino acid sequences of the S protein RBMs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 diverge in a manner that may reflect unique immune epitopes. To disseminate our research, we created a publicly accessible database, the SARV-CoV-2 Immune Viewer, for easy exploration and downloading of results.

We found the same phenomenon in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which further supports the validity of this observation. Curiously, for all three coronaviruses, more viral strains showed large immunogenicity loss in class II MHC presentation, than class I MHC presentation. This suggests that the CD4 + T cell-class II MHC axis, compared with the CD8 + T cell-class I MHC axis, may be more important for viral recognition and clearance by the host immune system, in alignment with recent research showing the critical antiviral roles of CD4 + T cells (24-27).",
