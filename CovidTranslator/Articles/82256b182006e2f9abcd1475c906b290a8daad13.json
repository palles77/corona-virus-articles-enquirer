In this study, we sought to leverage this uneven viral antagonism to identify critical host factors that govern disease outcome. Utilizing a systems-based approach, we examined differential regulation of IFN-\u03b3-dependent genes following infection with robust respiratory viruses including influenza viruses [A/influenza/Vietnam/ 1203/2004 (H5N1-VN1203) and A/influenza/California/04/2009 (H1N1-CA04)] and coronaviruses [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV)]. Categorizing by function, we observed downregulation of gene expression associated with antigen presentation following both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Further examination revealed global down-regulation of antigen-presentation gene expression, which was confirmed by proteomics for both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Importantly, epigenetic analysis suggested that DNA methylation, rather than histone modification, plays a crucial role in MERS-CoV-mediated antagonism of antigenpresentation gene expression; in contrast, H5N1-VN1203 likely utilizes a combination of epigenetic mechanisms to target antigen presentation. Together, the results indicate a common mechanism utilized by H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV to modulate antigen presentation and the host adaptive immune response.",

Understanding how these respiratory pathogens induce disease is key for treatment and prevention strategies (1) . For successful respiratory viruses, multiple elements of the host immune response must be overcome, including both innate and adaptive immunity (1, 3) . While these immune mechanisms are relatively conserved, complex interactions govern disease outcome, and successful viruses use a combination of approaches to combat host immunity. Even among related viruses, diverse strategies may produce similar infection results through distinct mechanisms (4) . Therefore, susceptibility to a host pathway may not be uniform across a viral family or apply to all viruses infecting the same tissue. In exploring these responses, cross-comparisons may identify common strategies used by different viruses to antagonize the host immune responses. In our approach, we sought to leverage differences and similarities between respiratory pathogens to identify novel viral antagonism strategies (5) .",

When all major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and antigenpresentation genes were considered, the data demonstrated global down-regulation of gene expression that was confirmed by proteomic analysis. However, in contrast to the mechanisms controlling ISG expression (6), analysis of histone modifications did not reveal Increases in either activating or repressive markers following MERS-CoV infection. Instead, changes in DNA methylation likely facilitate MERS-CoV-mediated down-regulation of antigen-presentation molecules. For H5N1-VN1203, both histone modification and DNA methylation may play a role through the activity of viral NS1. In contrast, MERS-CoV accessory ORF mutants maintain gene expression down-regulation despite robust attenuation in virus growth.

While some reports have indicated production by epithelial cells (9), RNA expression data indicated no IFN-\u03b3 signal following infection of Calu3 cells. However, responses to IFN-\u03b3 have been shown to be critical in the innate and adaptive immune response to respiratory infection, and epithelial cell IFN-\u03b3 responses may play a key role during infection (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Calu3 cells, treated with recombinant IFN-\u03b3, induced differential expression (DE) of 426 genes [logtwofold change (FC) of >1.5, adjusted P value < 0.05]. Using these data, we developed a consensus IFN-\u03b3-responsive list from the 136 genes induced at more than one time point (Table S1 ). While significant overlap was observed with type I IFN-responsive genes (42 of 136, 31%) (6), consensus IFN-\u03b3 genes also induced transcription factors, apoptosis/cell survival genes, ubiquitination machinery, and genes within other functional categories ( Table 1 ). The consensus IFN-\u03b3 gene list was then used to examine expression changes following infection with successful respiratory viruses. Despite the absence of IFN-\u03b3 signal in these cultures, infection with influenza H1N1-09, H5N1-VN1203, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV induced expression of IFN-\u03b3-responsive genes by other factors; however, these IFN-\u03b3-responsive gene expressions varied across viral infections, despite similar kinetics of replication (Fig. 1) . For H1N1-09 and SARS-CoV, the majority of IFN-\u03b3-responsive genes were strongly up-regulated, with only \u223c10% exhibiting downregulation. In contrast, >40% of these same genes were downregulated by H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV. Examining the IFN-\u03b3-responsive genes by functional subsets revealed multiple gene groups targeted for down-regulation (Table 1 ). Most notable for both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection were genes associated with antigen presentation, including several MHC molecules; 80% or more of the IFN-\u03b3-responsive genes associated with antigen presentation were down-regulated following H5N1-VN1203 or MERS-CoV infection ( Table 1 ). In contrast, <10% of these genes were down-regulated following either H1N1-09 or SARS-CoV infection.

We next sought to determine whether down-regulation of antigen presentation was limited to IFN-\u03b3-responsive genes or could be detected across the entire spectrum of antigen-presentation molecules. Therefore, we next examined gene expression of both MHC molecules and other components associated with antigen presentation; the majority of these genes were located within the MHC locus on human chromosome 6 (chr. 6), while others were interspersed throughout the genome (Table S2 ). The results indicated broad down-regulation of antigen-presentation molecules following both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 2 ). In contrast, H1N1-09 infection had no effect or strongly increased expression of these genes; similarly, SARS-CoV also induced expression for the majority of these genes. Globally, both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection resulted in reduced expression of both MHC class I and II molecules. Similarly, the expression of other genes involved in antigen presentation, including transcription factors (CTIIA) and machinery (TAP2 and PDIA3), both in the MHC locus and on other chromosomes (distant), was also strongly down-regulated. Importantly, while adjacent genes on chr. 6 not involved in antigen presentation and MHC class III genes (complement, TNF, etc.) had some modulation, down-regulation was not uniform, suggesting specific targeting of MHC and antigenpresentation molecules by both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV.",

Previously, we demonstrated that a subset of type I ISGs are down-regulated by H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infections, and our results implicated alterations in histone modification in driving differential ISG expression (6) . To determine whether histone modifications also affect antigen-presentation gene expression, we examined enrichment of activating (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) methylation markers on the 5\u2032 promoters of MHC class I (HLA-A), II (HLA-DRB), and III (LTA) molecules in lysates from cells infected with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, H5N1-VN1203, or H1N1-09 using a chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR (ChIP-PCR)based approach. For the activating histone marker (H3K4me3), enrichment was observed only in HLA-A promoter regions following H1N1-09 and H5N1-VN1203 infection, and no enrichment or loss of H3K4 trimethylation was observed for HLA-DRB1 or LTA promoters following either influenza virus infection (Fig. 4A ). SARS-CoV infections did not result in significant enrichment or loss of H3K4me3 for any of these genes. In contrast, MERS-CoV infection reduced H3K4 trimethylation for all three genes, with significant changes observed in HLA-DRB1 and LTA promoter regions. For all three promoter regions, strong reductions in the repressive marker (H3K27me3) were also observed following SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections (Fig. 4B) ; similarly, H1N1-09 and H5N1-VN1203 also reduced repressive marks for the HLA molecules. Together, the data suggest that modest transcriptional activation was possible if H3K4me3 motifs remained intact.",

In H5N1-VN1203 infections, we observed depletion of H3K4 trimethylation across the length of chr. 6, with the strongest depletion in parts of the MHC locus (Fig. 4C) . Concurrently, few chr. 6 genes exhibited substantial depletion of H3K27 trimethylation (Fig. S1A) , and some were enriched for H3K27me3 (Fig. S1B ). Taken together, these observations suggest that H5N1-VN1203 infection may reduce the potential for transcriptional activation of chr. 6 genes, particularly within the MHC locus, and further implies that histone alterations may contribute to H5N1-VN1203-mediated down-regulation of antigen-presentation gene expression. For MERS-CoV, histone modification data offer a muddled picture, with enrichment and depletion found for both activating and repressive markers (Fig. S1) . Coupled with the ChIP-PCR of the promoter regions, these results suggest that histone modifications are not the driver of MERS-CoV-mediated antagonism of antigen presentation.",

Direct methylation of genomic DNA functionally ablates expression, indirectly leading to reduced access and loss of histone marks. To examine this possibility, we performed methylated DNA-IPs (MeDIPs) with virus-infected cells and then assessed the methylation status of three antigen-presentation-associated gene promoters (HLA-A, B2M, and PDIA3) using PCR (Fig. 5A) . For H1N1-09, infection resulted in modest changes, with increased methylation of HLA-A and reduced methylation of B2M promoter regions. Similarly, SARS-CoV infection generally resulted in modest DNA methylation trending toward reduced methylation relative to mock-infected controls. In contrast, H5N1-VN1203 infection increased methylated DNA levels in the same target genes, and, strikingly, MERS-CoV infection resulted in complete methylation (100%) of all three target genes. To verify the effect observed in MERS-CoV infections, we performed MeDIP-PCR reactions for three additional antigen-presentation gene promoters (CIITA, HLA-E, and PSMB9) and again observed complete promoter methylation for all genes (Fig. S2) . Global methylation analysis of chr. 6 revealed robust methylation across the entire chromosome following MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 5B) . Importantly, while H5N1-VN1203 infection also induced increased methylation across chr. 6, its peaks were less in magnitude than observed in MERS-CoV infection.",

Both MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 produced significant cytopathic effect by 24 h postinfection (hpi), contrasting both SARS-CoV and H1N1-09. However, while a global increase in methylation was observed following MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 infection, it was far from uniform across the entire genome. More in-depth analysis of methylation data found that, following MERS-CoV infection, the (Table S3) found lower meCpG/Mbp rates, suggesting specificity in the magnitude of DNA methylation at the MHC locus and potentially other genomic locations. Similarly, H5N1-VN1203 methylation within the MHC locus corresponded to 34.29 meCpG/Mbp vs. 7.7 meCpG/Mbp over the remainder of the chr. 6. Together, these results suggest that DNA methylation is at least one of the primary mechanisms exploited by MERS-CoV to antagonize antigen-presentation gene expression in infected cells, while H5N1-VN1203 may use a combination of DNA methylation and histone-modification alterations to achieve a similar affect. Both Viral and Host Processes Contribute to DNA Methylation. To examine how these respiratory viruses target antigen presentation via epigenetic modulation, we utilized MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 mutants that lacked key viral proteins. Previous work by our group implicated influenza NS1 in histone modification and ISG down-regulation compared with a similarly replication attenuated PB2 mutant (6) . In this study, we extended this analysis to antagonism of antigen-presentation molecules. Following infection of Calu3 cells with wild-type (WT), C-terminal truncation of NS1 (NS1trunc124), or PB2 encoding an amino acid substitution (PB2-K627E) mutant viruses, we examined changes in viral replication as well as HLA-A and -C peptide abundance ( Fig.   6 A and B ). While the overall peptide level was decreased relative to mock, truncation of H5N1-VN1203 NS1 resulted in augmented protein expression of both MHC class I molecules relative to the WT virus. Importantly, the reduction of MHC class I downregulation was not a product of attenuated viral replication, as the PB2 mutant had similar replication kinetics and titer, but maintained HLA-A and -C antagonism (Fig. S3A) . Together, the results implicate a role for NS1 in modulation of antigen presentation following H5N1-VN1203 infection.",

Seeking mechanistic insights, epigenetic studies captured robust increases in DNA methylation following MERS-CoV infection with no similar trend observed following mock or SARS-CoV infection. However, while H5N1-VN1203 had augmented DNA methylation relative to mock, its overall increase was less uniform than MERS-CoV, leaving the possibility that histone modification may also contribute to control of antigen-presentation gene expression.

Alternatively, activation of DNA methylation pathways may be initiated by MERS-CoV infection, resulting in regulation of host constitutive processes as well as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor expression (18) .

In the context of antigen presentation, the expanded tropism of both viruses potentially impacts systemic aspects of adaptive immunity and memory responses. For H5N1 strains, modulation of antigen presentation may contribute to the inefficacy of the CD8 T-cell response during acute infection (25) and marginal, waning memory responses overall (26) . Similarly, MERS-CoV infection has been characterized by uneven and often marginal antibody serum neutralization in recovering patients (27, 28) .

            "text": "For viral antagonism, the epigenetic landscape represents a potent and important avenue to disrupt the host immune response (29) . While always a consideration for DNA viruses that reside in the nucleus, recent research has focused on how viruses utilize aspects of the epigenetic machinery to enable persistence and emergence (30) . In addition, several reports have highlighted how viruses have disrupted epigenetic regulation and impact the host immune response. For example, NS1 of influenza H3N2 has been implicated as a histone mimic disrupting the antiviral response (8) . Similarly, both hepatitis C virus and adenoviruses have proteins that interfere with epigenetics functions and alter global immune function (7, 31, 32) . Previous work by our group found clear association of repressive histone modification H3K27me3 with down-regulated ISGs following both MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 infection (6); subsequently, despite pathway and transcription factor activation, the repressed state physically prevented transcription of these genes. Similarly, our results in this work argue that DNA methylation plays a similar role in the loss of antigen-presentation molecules following both MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 infection. Importantly, the sequencing data suggest that other specific regions of the genome are also targeted by global methylation, potentially signifying critical pathways modulated by viral antagonism and providing a path for future studies. In addition, viruses may utilize distinct epigenetic mechanism in parallel, resulting in specific targeting of host ISGs by H3K27 trimethylation instead of DNA methylation within that genome region. Together, these results suggest that multiple viruses target different epigenetic processes to modulate aspects of host immunity and indicate that additional studies will be required to fully understand how epigenetics modulates the host immune response following virus infection.",

Convergent evolution predicts that diverse viruses will utilize similar and divergent strategies to overcome common host immune responses to produce successful infections (33) . Therefore, in leveraging available systems-based datasets, we seek similarities and contrast between viruses while taking advantage of uniform platforms, infection conditions, and data collection methods (34) . The results have provided insights into both MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 manipulation of IFN responses and antigen presentation. These findings provide not only a better understanding of the host response to infection, but also have the potential to aid in the development of treatment and prevention strategies. Future studies should expand these approaches to explore other specific aspects of immunity, including inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and autophagy. Similarly, viral cross-comparisons can also be integrated across data types as well as in vitro and in vivo systems as an additional metric for more traditional modeling approaches (35) (36) (37) (38) . Importantly, much of this analysis can occur on publicly available datasets, increasing both the utility and impact of already existing systems data (34, 39) . Overall, surveying contrasts in host responses between viruses represents a powerful means to understand treatment and pathogenesis.",

Briefly, for ChIP analysis, Calu3 cells were plated (\u223c1.5 \u00d7 10 6 per well) and infected with H5N1-VN1203 or H1N1-09 at an MOI of 5 and harvested at 0 and 12 hpi; cultures inoculated with PBS alone served as time-matched mock controls. Sonication conditions were chosen to result in the desired size distribution of the sonicated chromatin between 250 and 1,000 bp. Sonicated samples were then immunoprecipitated with anti-H3K4me3 (Qiagen) and anti-H3K27me3 (Qiagen). To determine genome-wide histone modification, ChIP DNA was subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) on a TruSeq ChIP Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq. NGS data analysis was performed by utilizing the CLC Genomics Workbench. The Histone ChIP-Seq plugin provided analysis tools for a complete histone modification analysis. Briefly, paired end reads were mapped against the human GRCh37/ hg19 reference genome by using a stringent alignment setting (mismatch cost = 2). Peaks were called against the time-matched mock reference reads. To determine specific genomic regions of histone modification enrichment, the maximum P value for peak calling was set to P < 0.05 to detect regions that had a significant fit with the peak shape.",

Briefly, for methylated DNA analysis, Calu3 cells were plated (\u223c1.5 \u00d7 10 6 per well) and infected with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, H5N1-VN1203, or H1N1-09 at a MOI of 5 or 3 (H5N1 only). Total genomic DNA was harvested 0, 12, 18, and 24 hpi by using the PureLink Genomic DNA Minikit. Cultures inoculated with PBS alone served as time-matched mock controls. Sonication conditions were chosen to result in the desired size distribution of the sonicated total DNA between 250 and 1,000 bp. Sonicated samples were then used to enrich methylated DNA by using the methyl-CpG binding domain of human MBD2 protein (MethylMiner Methylated DNA Enrichment Kit; Invitrogen). To determine the methylation status of MHC gene promoters, qRT-PCR was performed. For this, primer pairs targeted the CpG islands of target genes. Results were reported as the relative percentage of methylated and unmethylated DNA in each target genomic DNA sequence by using the \u0394\u0394Ct method. The fraction methylated of DNA in each sample was calculated by normalizing the total DNA amount to the amount of unmethylated DNA.",
