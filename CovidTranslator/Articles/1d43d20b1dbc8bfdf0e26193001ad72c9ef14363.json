Viruses obviously differ in important respects from non-living antigens, and they differ funda mentally from living cells, including the pathogenic microorganisms. Viral immunology is a \"transdisciplinary\" subject, and several of the great figures in its history, Jenner in the eighteenth century, Pasteur in the nineteenth and Burnet in the twentieth century, are honored as pioneers by both virologists and immunologists. Since the immune response is an aspect of resistance to disease that is restricted to vertebrate animals, we shall therefore have to consider only the minority of organisms that are vertebrates, and the minority of viruses that infect vertebrates. Indeed, we are ultimately concerned with the human host and the viruses that infect man, and with model systems that enable us to study problems of human medical relevance experi mentally.",

However, there were still a number of common infectious diseases for which neither a bacterium nor a protozoan could be incrimin ated as the causal agent. In 1898, Loeffler and Frosch (3) demonstrated that the economically important disease of cattle, foot-and-mouth-disease, could be transferred from one animal to another by material which could pass through a filter that retained the smallest bacteria. The same tech nique produced comparable results with other infectious diseases of unknown etiology. Following these discoveries, such diseases were tentatively ascribed to what were first called \"ultramicroscopic filterable viruses\", then \"ultrafilterable viruses\", and ultimately just \"viruses\". We now know that viruses also occur in all other groups of org anisms, from trees to mycoplasmas, and in our present state of knowledge it is not unreasonable to postulate that for every species of organism there will be found to exist one or perhaps many more species of virus (4).",

Indeed, Burnet entitled his Dunham Lectures, delivered at Harvard University in 1944,\"Virus as Organism\" (5) . However, at about this time the question was repeatedly posed as to whether viruses, whatever their host, might have common properties that distinguished them sharply from microorgan isms. There was a great deal of discussion about the nature of the \"eclipse period\" (6), and at about this time Hershey's demonstration in 1952 of the injection of DNA by bacteriophages (7) opened the way for a proper understanding of viral multiplication. The argument about the differences between viruses and microorganisms was sharpened and focussed by Lwoff (8) whose dictum that \"viruses are viruses are viruses,\" i.e., that all viruses show some properties that distinguish them from any microorganism, is now universally accepted (Table 1) . Exceptions to some of Lwoff f s generalizations have since been discovered, but three are still valid: (a) unlike even the smallest microorganisms (chlamydiae), viruses contain no functional ribosomes or other cellular organelles, although some enveloped viruses, notably in the genus Arenavirus, contain a few ribosomes derived from the host cell, (b) in RNA viruses the whole of the genetic information is encoded in RNA, a situation unique in biology, and (c) viruses lack enzymes for energy metabolism and they lack genes for such enzymes. Other distinctions apply to some but not all viruses , e.g., the isolated nucleic acid of viruses of several genera is infectious, so that the virus can be gen erated intracellularly from a single molecule of nucleic acid.",

Viruses can be subdivided according to the nature and amount of their nucleic acid, and the shape and size of the virion, into some twenty groups, some of which currently have the status of families, others of genera. Virologists have so far refrained from making any taxa higher than family, reflecting the belief that viruses are polyphyletic and that each family or genus now recognized probably arose independently of each other one, and that all were derived ultimately from cells. The size and shape of representative members of the various groups of viruses of vertebrates are illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 1 * Many of the features of viruses that fascinate virologists, such as the nature of their genomes (whether double or single-stranded, cyclic or linear, single mole cules or fragmented, messenger or complementary strand), and the mode of replication of their genome and the translation of its message, are to a large extent irrelevant to viral immunologists. What is important to them is the way that viruses affect cells (Table 2 ) and by their effects on cells affect organs and the organism (Tables 3 and 4 the effects of viruses of particular families or genera on cells and organs of particular species of host animal, since these interactions depend upon both the cells affected and the virus involved. Nevertheless, some generalizations are possible and may be valuable as a frame of reference. Tables 3 and 4 have been constructed with this in mind. ",

People living in the country side had long been aware that persons who tended cows (which also suffered from \"the pox\") did not catch smallpox from them, but merely got blisters on the hands. However, these milkmaids did not get smallpox when this disease hit the rest of the community. Edward Jenner took up this piece of folklore and investigated it systematically, culminating with his experiment with James Phipps and his memoir on the sub ject published in 1798 (see LeFanu, ref. 14) .

An interesting immunological feature of repeated infect ions by related serotypes is what Francis in 1955 called \"original antigenic sin\" (32). He found, and others have confirmed, that the serological response of an individual to influenza type A, for example, was dominated throughout life by antibody specific to the first type A strain that he was exposed to. This response is not a peculiar feature of influenza, but is characteristic of infections of long-lived animals with any virus of which there are several crossreacting antigenic types. It can be reproduced experiment ally with inactivated influenza virus vaccines (33) . It is probably explained by the fact that the influenza hemagglutinin subunits possess at least two different antigenic deter minants; one common to many different strains and the other strain-specific (34). Immunological memory in thymus-independent (B) lymphocytes (see below) to the common deter minant results in a powerful secondary response to this determinant upon challenge with any strain of influenza virus that possesses it; the primary response to the unique deter minant is comparatively weaker (35) .",

Burnet's first review article on an immunological topic (44) was concerned very largely with observations and speculations about neutraliza tion, based mainly on his own studies using pock-counting on the chorioallantoic membrane. Dulbecco studied the subject soon after he had established the plaque method for animal virus (45), and subsequently Fazekas de St. Groth (46) wrote extensively about neutralization of the \"persistent fraction,\" largely in an adversary posture to Dulbecco.",

However, we wonder how relevant much of this earlier work was to the problem of the intact animal, since it was carried out with \"inacti vated\" serum and sought to minimize, where possible, the role of cells other than those subject to infection with the viral inoculum. Neutralization of infectivity by antibodies, nevertheless, remains a matter of vital interest to virologists. It is of major importance in controlling reinfections; the whole vast structure of immunization as a public health measure rests upon the production of antibodies. It is also important in controlling the spread of viruses between cells when the virions are free in the extracellular fluids or plasma. Even though it may not reflect what happens in infected animals, the neutralization reaction as tested in animals or in cell cultures is still a valuable method for epidemiological studies.",

The prototype is, of course, Jennerian vaccination against smallpox. Then, with the cultivation of influenza virus in the chick embryo in 1940 (47) and the fear of a repetition of the World War I exper iences of influenza, a major effort was made to produce vaccines against influenza. Although a rather unsatisfactory product, largely because of the predictable (antigenic drift) and unpredictable (antigenic shift) changes in its surface antigens (48) The principle of attenuation, first developed in 1884 by Pasteur for rabies (17), has resulted in the production of effective vaccines for yellow fever (50), poliomyelitis (51), measles (52), and rubella (53), as well as numerous veterinary vaccines. There is now renewed interest in live virus vaccines for influenza (54), using modern genetic principles for building the required properties of avirulence, growth capacity, and antigenicity into the vaccine strain. Further, in view of the demonstrated importance of IgA in infections of the respiratory tract, there is now a renewed emphasis on administration of some attenuated virus vaccines by this route. It is interesting to recall that Burnet (55) used both these principles, an attenuated virus given normally, in his wartime studies on vaccination against influenza.",

Immune complexes in which viral antigens rather than virions are involved may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of some acute infections, such as hemorrhagic dengue (62) and in the glomerulonephritis found in several chronic viral infections (Table 7 ; Chapter 20). Indeed, antigenemia and the early formation of immune com plexes, rather than viremia as such, may provide the pathogenetic basis for the fever and symptoms that mark the end of the incubation period in many generalized viral infections, and the prodromal rash may have a similar explanation. Complement may be important in these reactions (see Chapter 6), as well as in neutralization in vivo (63).",

The controversies of the latter nineteenth century between Metchnikoff's school, which championed phagocytic cells as the major factor in resistance to bacterial infections, and von Behring and Pfeiffer, who claimed that humoral factors (antibodies) were all-important, has been resolved in favor of both sides; effective host resistance depends upon both opsonins and phagocytes. The \"microphages\" (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) and macrophages (including blood monocytes) have very different roles. Clinical experience and experimental studies show that agranulocytosis (deficiency of polymorphonuclear leukocytes) greatly enhances susceptibility to bacterial infections, but hardly affects the course of viral infections, and much additional evidence shows that these cells do not play an important role in defense against viral infections. However, macrophages, both in the tissues and those circula ting in the blood as monocytes, affect the course of viral infections in a number of ways. The fixed tissue macrophages, especially the littoral cells of the liver and spleen, clear viruses from the circulation and may then destroy them, or alternatively act as foci for their multiplication (71). Several of the viruses that cause persistent infections multiply preferentially in macrophages (Table 7) . Blood monocytes are also important as effector cells in antiviral reactions. They are produced by dividing precursors located mainly in bone marrow, and spend a relatively short time in blood (of the order of one day) before migrating into tissues (72, 73) . In this way, fixed tissue macrophages are constantly replenished by new cells from blood, and there is a blood-borne supply of mobile phagocytic cells available to enter sites of infection or other inflammatory areas.",

Another major theoretical advance in immunology was the enunciation of the clonal selection theory of antibody production by Burnet in 1957 (74, 75) . As Burnet (55) recounts, this theory, which has had a major impact on modern immunology, arose from his contemplation of Jerne's (76) \"natural selection\" hypothesis for antibody production.

            "text": "Mackaness (97, 98) provided convincing evidence in the early 1960 , s that recovery from several bacterial infections was associated with the acquisition of delayed hypersensitivity and showed that this was accompanied by the appearance of \"activated\" macrophages, which possess enhanced but immunologically nonspecific bactericidal powers. In these infections humoral immunity was unimportant for recovery. Subsequently it was shown that T lymphocytes were the specific effector cells responsible for this form of cellmediated immunity (99, 100). Antiviral cell-mediated immunity is also triggered by T cells (101, 102) which operate against poxvirus infections by recruiting blood monocytes to foci of infection in target organs, thus leading to viral clearance by phagocytosis (103). Immune serum is far less efficient than T cells. Macrophage activation, and the production of interferon by antigen-sensitive lympho cytes, a phenomenon first described by Glasgow (104) , may improve the virucidal efficiency of macrophages within foci of infection.",

            "text": "In lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus infection of adult mice a cell-mediated mechanism is responsible for the production of symptoms and death (105). Recent work shows that the pathogenetic potential cannot be transferred from infected to normal adult mice by immune serum (106) but can be transferred by immune T lymphocytes (107), which are also capable of lysing LCM-infected target cells in vitro (108). Both these T cell functions are expressed only when T cell donors and recipients (or target cells) share genes in the major transplantation system of the mouse (109). This link between transplantation antigens and T cell function has been confirmed in other viral and bacterial infections, and has interesting implications in viral immunology and in other fields of biology.",
