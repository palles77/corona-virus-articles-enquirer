We estimated model parameters from published information with the statistical method and stochastic simulation, we found the parameters that achieved the best simulation test result. The next stage involved quantitative predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the QSEIR model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland China. The main results are as follows. If the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020. During March18-30, 2020, the epidemic would be controlled. The end date would be in the period from August 20 to September 1, 2020. With 80% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies.",

The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can be empirically validated. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world. In mainland China, the quarantine measures can't be relaxed before the end of March 2020. China can fully resume production with appropriate antiepidemic measures beginning in early April 2020. The results of this study also implied that other countries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act more decisively and take in time quarantine measures though it may have negative short-term public and economic consequences.",

Compared to SARS-CoV (9.56% mortality) and MERS-CoV (34.4% mortality), the COVID-19 appears to be less virulent at this point except for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions (table 1). COVID-19 was confirmed as subject to human-to-human transmission and it is very contagious. The basic reproduction number R0 for COVID-19 was estimated by WHO and some research institutes in the range of 1.4-6.6 (table 2). This value is slightly higher than that of the 2003 SARS epidemic, and much higher than that of influenza and Ebola. The incubation days of COVID-19 in Wuhan city is 5-10 days with a mean of 7 days (Fan et al., 2020). On average, the duration from confirmed stage to cure or death is 10 days in nation-wide reporting according to Guan et al. (2020) . A long incubation period and an associated large number of patients with mild symptoms increase the difficulty of prevention and control of the epidemic. The likelihood of travel-related risks of the disease spreading has been noted by Bogoch et al. (2020) and Cao et al. (2020a) wherein they indicated the potentials for further regional and global spread (Leung et al., 2020).",

The parameter \u03b2 is similar to the basic reproduction number which can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.

The parameter, \u03b1(t), was designed to represent the ratio of people who was not restricted to a specific area and had chances to contact with COVID-19 virus during special period. The \u03b1(t) and \u03b2(t) vary according to the strength of the prevention and control measures for the epidemic. To make the model accord with reality, contrast with the standard SEIR model, we added two parameters \u0394(t) and \u03b8(t). The \u0394(t) is the ratio of people with vaccination at time t. \u03b8(t) is the natural mortality of the population in a region at time t (figure 3). The value of \u03b4(t) is closely related with the virus incubation and infectious periods and \u03b3(t) is dependent on the treatment level and patients' health status. It is assumed that the virus incubation period is 7 days and the duration from confirmed stage to cure or death is 10 days based on nation-wide information (Guan et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2020) .

We estimated the model parameters reversely for the QSEIR model from published information with statistical methods and stochastic simulations; from these experiments, we found the parameters that achieved the best simulation test results. The application verified that the method is effective. The paper not only predicted the peak number and peak date of confirmed cases, but also provided estimates of the sensitivity of parameters of QSEIR, the duration of the epidemic and effects of different containment strategies at the same time. The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can be empirically validated. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world.",

As of March 7, 2020, 21, 110 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 93 countries/territories/ areas. Hence, it is imperative that the development of vaccines and specific drugs for COVID-19 should be promoted by many countries with the technical resources to conduct the necessary high-level research. Until they appear, it is the most important that appropriate quarantine measures are retained. In mainland China, the quarantine measures should not be relaxed before the end of March, 2020. China can fully resume production with appropriate anti-epidemic measures beginning in early April, 2020. The results of this study also implied that other countries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act more decisively and take in time quarantine measures though it may have negative short-term public and economic consequences (Editorial, 2020).",
