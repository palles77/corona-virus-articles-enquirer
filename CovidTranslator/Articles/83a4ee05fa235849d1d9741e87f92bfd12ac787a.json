Through time, society has integrated crocodilians species into conservation efforts as a natural resource. Countries such as Australia, India, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, and the United States maintain intensive production operations for various species. Alligators, crocodiles, and caimans are all found in farm or ranch scenarios where they are raised for skin and meat. Crocodilian farms maintain their own breeding stock of animals from which they collect eggs every year for hatching. On the other hand, a crocodilian ranch is characterized by the harvest of eggs from the wild. A percentage of the eggs collected is then returned to the wild to maintain the population. Most American Alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) are raised in a ranch scenario. Regardless of the methodology, this industry has played an integral role in the conservation of crocodilian species around the world. People now view this species as a natural resource that must be protected for future generations.",

In the United States, the American Alligator industry is also varied between and even within states. In Louisiana, most of the operations are ranches. In Florida, both ranches and farm operations are found. In a ranch operation, buildings are either circular (Figure 41 -1) or rectangular with some divisions on the inside to create a number of individual pens. The buildings are completely enclosed with one or two entrances and no source of light. The pens usually allow communication of water and are lined with rubber, fiberglass, or other nonporous material. Heating elements may also be contained within the concrete slab to aid in temperature control. Water heaters are used to maintain temperature when refilling the pens. Water sources can be city water, well water, or bayou water. Most operations do not use a filtration system. Temperature is the only water parameter routinely monitored. The frequency of cleaning the pens can range from three to six times a week depending on the ranch and the size of the animals. A commercial pelleted diet is readily available, and some diets are supplemented with chicken, fish, or nutria. Vitamin supplements are sometimes mixed with the feed. Feed is typically placed on a suspended wooden table in the middle of the pen. Feeding frequency is five to six times per week. A complete history is essential in diagnosis of diseases in a crocodilian operation.",

            "text": "Many diseases of crocodilians are considered to be caused by stress. Stress has been defined as \"a physiological answer to a perceived threat that includes, but is not restricted to, increased adrenal secretion.\" 1 Stress is also thought of as any event that challenges homeostasis, and likely the response to that challenge involves more than an adrenal response. The autonomic nervous system, the hypothalamic adrenal axis, neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, and neuroimmunologic mediators all have a role in the response of the immune system to stress. 2 How stress and immunosuppression are measured is still a subject of controversy in veterinary medicine. No one test can be used to measure stress, but rather physiologic changes are combined to give an idea of what is involved in a stress response. A number of research studies have examined the stress response in crocodilians. These studies have looked at the stress associated with restraint, long-term corticosterone implants, cold shock, and stocking densities. [3] [4] [5] [6] Lance, Morici, and Elsey 7 provide an overview of the physiology and endocrinology of stress in crocodilians. Catecholamines, glucocorticoids, glucose, and lactate have been implicated in the stress response of crocodilians. In addition, an argument is made for immunosuppression on the basis of changes observed in the white blood cells. [3] [4] [5] 7 The factors that influence stress in crocodilian and reptile species are reviewed by Rooney and Guillette. 1 Enough evidence exists to suggest that stress plays an important role in the physiology of crocodilians, and it may indeed predispose them to illness. Overcrowding, handling, excessive noise, diet changes, temperature irregularities, etc., should all be considered as predisposing or confounding factors of disease. These need to be a consideration with diagnostics and recommendation of treatment for these species.",

Only a few reports exist of Mycobacterium sp. affecting crocodilian species, perhaps because of the difficulties associated with the culture techniques.

Clinical signs are nonspecific, lethargy and anorexia, although conjunctivitis and blepharitis were observed in one of two crocodiles. 11, 12 Hepatitis is thought to be the main effect of adenoviral infection.

            "text": "Integumentary disease is likely the most important process that affects captive crocodilians. The environment in which they are raised predisposes them to it, and the economic impact can be devastating. Most integumentary lesions in crocodilians usually arise from fighting. Lacerations, abscesses, and draining tracts can all be observed in captive and wild crocodilians ( Figure 41 -2). Consequently, these open wounds can serve as a nidus for microorganisms, especially fungi and bacteria. An additional factor in captive operations is the accumulation of fatty material in the form of slime on the surface of the water. This occurs when meat supplements are fed in addition to a commercial diet. This slime attaches to the skin of the animals and the enclosure, creating an environment for bacterial and fungal growth. A surfactant disinfectant can be used to reduce the amount of slime on the enclosure. Bacterial dermatitis can lead to septicemia and death; therefore, skin lesions must be recognized early for appropriate therapy. Fungal dermatitis is also common because many fungi thrive in the water column and environment of Continued captive alligators. In most instances, both bacteria and fungi are present in skin lesions. Culture and sensitivity testing can be frustrating in these cases because of the mixed flora found in the lesions. Nonetheless, antimicrobial therapy should be instituted. Medications can be mixed in the feed to provide adequate dosage. The use of systemic antifungal medications is cost prohibitive in treatment of a large number of animals; therefore, a combination of good hygiene and water treatments with disinfectants is recommended in these situations. A number of parasites are known to affect crocodilians. Paratrichosoma spp. are capillaroid parasites that cause a zigzag lesion on the skin. These lesions are cosmetic, and no evidence has been found of further pathology in affected animals. This parasite is known to affect various crocodile species in the wild and is believed to have a stage of its lifecycle dependent on soil; therefore, it is not observed in captive scenarios where animals are kept on concrete. 11 Finally, pox virus has been reported in various crocodilian species. Regardless of the etiology, good hygiene is essential in the prevention and treatment of integumentary disease in crocodilians. The etiology itself is at times not as important as what conditions predisposed them to the disease.",

These can be found on the head, palpebrae, maxilla, mandible, limbs, palate, tongue, and gingiva. [16] [17] [18] Other signs observed include palpebral and generalized edema. Resolution of clinical signs was observed 6 weeks after improvement of husbandry in one case 17 and after 5 months in another case with no changes in husbandry. 18 On the other hand, lesions in crocodiles have been described as 2-to 8-mm-diameter, yellow to brown, wart-like, sometimes firm, and unraised to raised nodules with occasional shallow ulcers. These lesions can be found on the head, palpebrae, nostrils, sides of the mouth, oral cavity, limbs, ventral neck, and coelom and at the root of the tail. 19, 20 Resolution of lesions was reported to occur as early as 3 to 4 weeks. 19 Light microscopy reveals epithelial hyperplasia, acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and necrosis, and at times, Borrel and Bollinger's bodies are also visible. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Secondary bacterial and fungal infections may also be present at the time of diagnosis. Horner 19 reported the use of an autogenous vaccine to treat pox virus in Nile Crocodiles. No specific treatment recommendations exist. Maintaining appropriate husbandry is essential in the prevention and resolution of pox virus in crocodilian farms.",

They can be found on any section of a scale and do not appear concave or convex with respect to the scale's surface. Routine microscopic examination reveals dermal nodular lymphoid proliferation with perivascular cuffing. Similar lesions have also been observed in other tissues besides the skin. One of the problems with identification of the lesions is that they are sometimes not seen until the hides are removed from the animal. Therefore, antemortem identification is not very accurate at this time.",

However, the current thought is that alligators can have high viremias develop and shed the virus in the feces, leading to horizontal transmission of the virus. This represents an opportunity for zoonosis in captive operations. Some suspect cases exist of alligator to human transmission. A strict building quarantine and hygiene strategies should be implemented to prevent spread to other animals in the facility and to the workers. This is now a reportable disease, and one should contact the state veterinarian and the state office of Clinical signs include swimming in circles, head tilt ( Figure 41-6) , muscle tremors, weakness, lethargy, and anorexia. On necropsy, one may also observe evidence of aspiration and pneumonia. Proliferative enteritis has been diagnosed in a group of alligators with positive results for WNV. The colon lesions tested positive for WNV 26 (Figure 41-7) . Clinically, these animals appeared bloated and were unable to submerge in the water. This was likely the result of a blockage caused by the fibrous membrane in the colon. Affected animals in captive operations have ranged in age from 1 month to more than 12 months old. In younger animals, infection is usually severe and acute with as much as a 50% mortality rate. The pattern of deaths is usually seen as a sudden onset of mortalities followed by a peak and subsequent decline in the number of deaths. However, sporadic mortalities may also be seen, especially in older animals. No proposed treatments exist for WNV other than increasing hygiene to prevent the accumulation of feces. Once the infection runs its course, the surviving animals continue to thrive. Definitive diagnosis is best accomplished with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culture of brain and spinal cord. Veterinarians should take additional precautions with necropsies of suspect animals.",

In a review of articles on crocodilian diseases, a fair number show lung lesions on necropsy. Respiratory signs can often be confused with neurologic signs, and a clear distinction must be established. On the other hand, respiratory disease may accompany neurologic disease as a consequence of weakness that leads to aspiration. Clinical signs associated with respiratory disease in crocodilians may include abnormal swimming (either in circles or on one side of the body), dyspnea, tachypnea, excessive basking, nasal discharge, and anorexia, among others. As these animals become weak, the basihyoid valve does not function properly and they can aspirate food or water. Because of the pharyngeal anatomy of crocodilians, aspiration is an unlikely event in healthy animals. Therefore, any evidence of it should be indicative of animals with an underlying illness. Most respiratory infections are either bacterial ( Figure 41-8) or fungal in origin. A number of rhinitis and pharyngitis syndromes have also been described in some crocodilian species. 11 Fungal infections are perhaps not as commonly diagnosed but still need to be a consideration, especially for captive crocodilians. An early report showed a fungal pneumonia associated with Beauveria bassiana in two alligators, 27 and Fusarium moniliforme was found in another case. 28 Bacterial and fungal cultures should be obtained from the lungs in cases where respiratory disease is suspected. This allows a choice of appropriate treatment on the basis of sensitivity testing.",

Clinical signs are nonspecific and include lethargy, weakness, anorexia, white ocular discharge, paresis, and edema (facial, periocular, cervical, limbs). 9 Pneumonia, pericarditis, and polyarthritis can be diagnosed on necropsy. Pathogenicity of M. alligatoris has been documented for A. mississippiensis and for the Broad-nosed Caiman (Caiman latirostris). 29, 30 Other crocodilian species closely related to alligators are also potentially susceptible. Treatment should include antimicrobial therapy. Helmick et al. 31 reviewed antimicrobial susceptibility for M. alligatoris. A second Mycoplasma species, M. crocodyli, is known to affect Nile Crocodiles. 10 Lesions are similar to those observed with M. alligatoris. Some studies have examined the use of an autogenous vaccine for M. crocodyli, but work is still needed to determine its true efficacy. 32, 33 Mycobacteriosis Another bacterium of interest is Mycobacterium sp. Although it is not commonly diagnosed in reptiles, a number of unpublished clinical cases from alligators have shown acid-fast organisms consistent with Mycobacterium sp. These animals had evidence of pneumonia on necropsy as shown by multiple white foci, 1 to 4 mm in diameter, on the lung parenchyma. 26 Other cases of pulmonary and enteric mycobacterial infections are mentioned by Youngprapakorn, Ousavaplangchai, and Kanchanapangka. 34 Difficulties of growing Mycobacterium sp. make its definitive diagnosis a challenge.",

Only a small number of these abnormalities are observed in most captive operations. Those affected may be runts of the group and have other concurrent disease. This is seen less often as better and improved diets are offered to captive crocodilians. Nonetheless, some operations still may offer no source of calcium in the diet. The innate requirement of ultraviolet B light as a source of vitamin D 3 in crocodilians is not known. They appear to be able to obtain appropriate levels from their diet, but research in this area needs to be performed. The author has seen adult alligators raised in enclosed buildings and offered a pelleted diet with some meat supplement that show no evidence of metabolic disease.

A more common process is likely associated with infectious enteritis or septicemia. This is difficult to assess grossly because crocodilians have very thick intestines normally. However, crocodilians appear to have a characteristic response to insult of the gastrointestinal tract. Accumulation of fibrous material or necrotizing lesions is commonly seen on necropsy (Figure 41-14) . This reaction is aggressive and can even lead to obstructions caused by the fibrous material itself. Obstruction can also occur with fecal impactions and torsions. Gastric ulcerations and abnormalities of the gastric mucosa are also routinely observed on necropsy and may be associated with stress and diet. Finally, the intestinal tract contains a large amount of Peyer's patches and likely represents a site of aggressive inflammatory response to infectious agents.",
