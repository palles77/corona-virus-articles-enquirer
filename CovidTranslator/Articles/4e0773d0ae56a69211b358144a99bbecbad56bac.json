Previous studies have revealed that the expression of Arg I is increased and the expression of iNOS is reduced in the serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. As one of the most important immune organs and HIV replication sites, whether similar changes are present in the lymph nodes following HIV infection remains to be elucidated. To investigate this, the present study collected lymph node and blood specimens from 52 HIV-infected patients to measure the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS by immunohistochemistry and fluoresence-based flow cytometry. Compared with control subjects without HIV infection, the patients with HIV had significantly higher expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and higher frequencies of Arg I + CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells in the blood and lymph nodes, and these results were contrary the those of iNOS in the corresponding compartments. The expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and blood were negatively associated with peripheral CD4 + T cell count and positively associated with viral load. However, the expression levels of iNOS in the lymph nodes and blood were positively associated with peripheral CD4 + T cell count and negatively associated with viral load. These results showed that alterations in the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the peripheral T cells and peripheral nodes of HIV infected patients are associated with disease progression in these patients. These results indicate a potential to therapeutic strategy for delaying disease progression through regulating and manipulating the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in patients infected with HIV.",

L-arginine is a substrate of arginase (Arg), including Arg I and II, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), including NOS1, 2 and 3). Arg I and II hydrolyzes L-arginine into L-ornithine and urea, and L-ornithine is further metabolized into polyamines, which are involved in the proliferation and differentiation of cells (7) . NOS catalyzes the conversion of L-arginine into citrulline and nitric oxide (NO), and NO is an important effector and regulator of the immune system (8, 9) . Arg I is released from immune cells, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils, during inflammation, and is also involved in the inflammatory response (10) . NOS2, or inducible NOS (iNOS) is expressed in a variety of immune cells (11) . Studies have reported that Arg I regulates the bioavailability of L-arginine, which is involved in certain immune-associated pathological processes, including inflammation-triggered immune dysfunction, immune evasion of cancer cells, fibrosis, immunosuppression and immune responses to infectious agents (5, 11, 12) . As a competitor to Arg I, iNOS hydrolyzes L-arginine into NO, which is important in destroying parasites, bacteria, viruses and cancer cells, as well as in vascular dilation (13) (14) (15) .",

Informed consent was obtained prior to surgical resection of the LNs, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the 302 Hospital of PLA (Beijing, China) and the 4th People's Hospital of Nanning (Nanning, China). LNs were routinely collected during surgery from the neck (n=27), armpit (n=20) and groin (n=5), and were processed for further examination. At the same time, 10 ml peripheral blood was collected from the patient and control groups. HIV/AIDS was diagnosed according to the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-infected Adults and Adolescents (USDHHS 2013) (19), and these patients were divided into an asymptomatic group (n=19) and an AIDS group (n=33). In addition, peripheral superficial biopsies of the LNs were collected from the neck and armpit of 13 subjects without HIV infection, recruited from the 302 Hospital of PLA, and were processed for pathological examination by two experienced pathologists. Exclusion criteria included the presence of cancer, infection and autoimmune diseases, and the presence of reactive hyperplasia was confirmed in those subjects who then served as controls. In addition, peripheral blood was collected from 20 healthy control subjects.",

Therefore, in the present study, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry were used to detect the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in peripheral T cells and LNs. The results showed that, compared with controls, asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV infected patients exhibited increased frequencies of Arg I positive CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells in the peripheral blood and LNs, and increased protein expression levels of Arg I in the LNs. In addition, the frequencies of Arg I positive CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells in the peripheral blood and LNs, and the protein expression levels of Arg I in the LNs were negatively associated with peripheral CD4 + T cell count and positively correlated with HIV load. By contrast, the frequencies of iNOS positive CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells in the peripheral blood and LNs, and the protein expression levels of iNOS were decreased in the LNs of HIV-infected patients, compared with controls. Furthermore, the frequencies of iNOS positive CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells in the peripheral blood and LNs, and the protein expression levels of iNOS in the LNs were positively associated with peripheral CD4 + T cell count and negatively associated with HIV load. In arginine-mediated metabolism, L-arginine is hydrolyzed into urea and ornithine, and ornithine is a precursor of polyamines, which are indispensable for the proliferation of cells and parasites (5, (26) (27) (28) . At least two subtypes of arginase have been identified in mammals: Cytoplasmic Arg I and mitochondrial Arg II (29) . These are involved in the same reaction (30) , although Arg I is more important in the urea cycle of the liver. In addition to its role in L-arginine metabolism, Arg is important for immune system function (31,32) as it can inhibit NO synthesis, induce fibrosis and tissue regeneration (33, 34) . Arg is also involved in multiple inflammatory diseases, and is essential for normal T cell function (6, 35, 36) .",

In the NOS pathway, L-arginine is metabolized by iNOS into citrulline and NO, and NO is important in the destruction of cancer cells, viruses, bacteria and parasites and in regulation of a variety of immune cells (40) . NOS has three isoforms, which include two constitutive isoforms, neural NOS and endothelial NOS, and one inducible isoform (iNOS) (41) . Constitutive NOS is predominantly involved in the physiological synthesis of NO and the regulation of different physiological functions, and its activity is Ca2 + -dependent (42) . However, iNOS is predominantly involved in the immune regulation and pro-inflammatory response (43, 44) . L-arginine is a substrate of Arg and iNOS, therefore, high expression levels of Arg may deplete L-arginine and increase levels of ornithine and polyamines, which are required for the proliferation of cells and parasites. A reduction in L-arginine causes a decrease in NO through the iNOS pathway (11) . The competition between Arg and iNOS is pivotal in the immune response to infection and determines the course of infection. For example, the peritoneal macrophages in rats differ from those in mice by being resistant to Toxoplasma gondi infection in nature. This resistance has been ascribed to the increased expression and activity of iNOS and, reduced activity of Arg I in rat peritoneal macrophages, compared with mouse peritoneal macrophages (12) . HIV infection significantly reduces the number of CD4 + T cells, particularly in the AIDS phase, and as polyamine, which is the metabolic product of L-arginine by Arg, is an essential substrate for cell proliferation, increased Arg I in the peripheral blood and LNs can increase the number of CD4 + T cells following HIV infection (11) . The results of the present study indicated the negative correlation between the expression of Arg I in peripheral T cells and LNs and peripheral CD4 + T cell count, suggesting that the expression of Arg I increased to compensate for the reduction in CD4 + T cells. However, L-arginine regulates the transcription of iNOS in a concentration-dependent manner (39) and Arg significantly reduces the levels of L-arginine, leading to reduction in iNOS synthesis. Thus, the increase in the expression levels This Arg-induced reduction in iNOS synthesis leads to a reduction in the production of NO, and this release of NO by macrophages is important role in innate immunity (11) .",

All these factors contribute to the significant increase in HIV replication and compromise anti-infection ability in the AIDS phase, resulting in the development of opportunistic infections. The reduction in NO due to the competition between Arg and iNOS is also important in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including atherosclerosis and hypertension, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetes, allergic asthma and inflammatory diseases (47) (48) (49) (50) . Thus, as an important metabolic enzyme, which affects NO synthesis, mechanisms to inhibit the progression of disease by inhibiting Arg activity and functional interference remains an area of increased interest. Certain synthetic and natural compounds that inhibit Arg have been investigated as disease therapies, with certain small molecule inhibitors of Arg showing potential in the treatment of diabetes, allergic inflammation and Schistosoma mansoni parasitic infection (47, 51, 52) . At the same time, evidence in rats shows that Arg I may serve as a biomarker for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (53) . The results of the present study also showed that HIV load and peripheral CD4 + T cells were independently associated with the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS. Thus, although HAART may exert therapeutic effects by reducing the expression of Arg I and increasing the expression of iNOS, Arg inhibitors may be used as an adjuvant therapy to treat HIV infection, particularly in those with AIDS, and to improve immune function, prevent opportunistic infections and inhibit viral replication. In addition, this correlation suggests that the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in peripheral T cells may be used diagnostically to predict the progression of HIV infections.",

In addition, the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the T cells of peripheral blood and LNs may be as a potential parameter to predict disease progression, as the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in peripheral blood and LN T cells were found to be correlated with HIV load and CD4 + T cell count.
