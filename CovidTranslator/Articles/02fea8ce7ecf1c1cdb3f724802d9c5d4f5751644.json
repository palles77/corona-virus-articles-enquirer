The difference between the rates of infection in the asymptomatic group and in each of the three other categories was statistically significant (p\u22640.01). Among HRV-positive children with samples submitted to the diagnostic laboratory, 55% were hospitalized which was similar to that observed for respiratory syncytial virus (52.7%) among children of a similar age group and time period (P=0.85).

            "text": "Respiratory tract infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide (1) . Many viral pathogens have been associated with respiratory tract disease. Among the most common of these pathogens are the human rhinoviruses (HRV) which, until recently, were thought to cause mainly mild upper respiratory tract infection. HRV were found to be the cause of 80% of cases of the common cold in adults who had self-diagnosed colds (2) . HRV belong to the picornavirus family of viruses that include the polioviruses, the enteroviruses and hepatitis A virus, among others. The first HRV was isolated in 1956 (3, 4) and since that time, more than 100 genotypically and serotypically diverse HRV have been identified. New HRV continue to be discovered (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) , suggesting that this genus may be even more diverse than previously thought. The diversity of HRV and their slow growth in cell culture hampered the study and detection of these viruses, when they were thought to be of minor clinical significance. The development of more sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques such as PCR assays (12, 13) , capable of detecting multiple HRV with a single reaction, has led to a greater appreciation of the clinical significance of these viruses (for review, see (14) ).",

Category 1 included children who had evidence of upper and/or lower respiratory tract infection without wheezing (PC non-wheezing); Category 2 included children who had evidence of wheezing (PC wheezing) with or without other symptoms of respiratory tract disease or infection; Category 3 included asymptomatic children who were seen for routine well-child visits and did not have any evidence of either upper or lower respiratory tract infection on the day of enrollment or in the 15 days prior to enrollment (Asymptomatic). Category 4 included children from whom a respiratory specimen was submitted to the Yale-New Haven Hospital Clinical Virology Laboratory (Clinical Virology) for testing for respiratory viruses. Specimens from patients in Category 4 were submitted at the discretion of the medical team from the Emergency Department, inpatient wards, intensive care units and hospital-affiliated outpatient urgent care clinics. Patients were included in Category 4 only if the results of the tests on the specimens were negative for adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1-3, influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA). The specimens screened in this study were not cultured for HRV. All of the specimens from Category 4 were screened for the human bocavirus (HBoV) by PCR as previously described (39) . Collection of specimens and clinical data were approved by the Yale University Human Investigation Committee.

This rate of infection is higher than the 8% rate of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection previously detected in a similar population in New Haven (42) . Other researchers have found HRV to have a prevalence of 26% in sick children, higher than the prevalence of RSV, influenza, parainfluenza and enteroviruses (28) . That study and ours strongly suggest that HRV may be a more common pathogen than other viruses traditionally associated with lower respiratory tract infection. Furthermore, 55% of HRV-infected patients in the Clinical Virology Category were hospitalized at the time of specimen collection, suggesting that HRV infection is a major cause of hospitalization among young children which is consistent with other studies (15, 22, 43) . Indeed, the percentage of HRV-infected children who were hospitalized was similar to the percentage of RSV-infected children. The high prevalence of this pathogen, along with considerable morbidity as evidenced by high rates of hospitalizations, suggests that HRV are of major clinical significance and that a rapid sensitive assay capable of detecting most rhinovirus strains would be an important diagnostic tool.",

There appears to be no association between particular isolates and the seasonal distribution of this virus. While most cases of HRV infection occurred during spring and fall-winter months, there does not appear to have been any specific HRV isolates with peak activity during this period, suggesting that these viruses do not have a true seasonal distribution and circulate throughout the year.
