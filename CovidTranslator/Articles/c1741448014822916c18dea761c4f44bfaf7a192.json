Adults lose more time from work due to these infections than to any other single condition; children lose time from school. Although the incidence of illness is extremely high, the death rate due to acute respiratory disease is low. Acute respiratory infections comprise a spectrum of diseases ranging from a mild case of the common cold to serious bronchopneumonia or empyema. Any respiratory pathogen or group of pathogens can be associated with a variety of Clinical syndromes, and any clinical syndrome may be produced by a number of respiratory pathogens. Although most acute respiratory infections are due to known viruses, many viral agents remain unknown, and clinical observation alone cannot determine the etiologic agent in a given patient. Even under optimal circumstances it is difficult to confirm the presence of viral agents during the acute phase of illness, when such information would be most helpful. In the Cleveland family study, Dingle found that respiratory infections accounted for two thirds of the total illness in the community; approximately 97% of these infections were due to a virus.",

The culturing of bacteria, fungi or mycoplasma from the pharynx or nasopharynx does not necessarily establish those organisms as the cause of disease. Since some of these organisms are susceptible to antimicrobials, the clinician must be astute in determining which infections need therapy.",

Age is significant; certain young children will respond to a variety of viral agents with a characteristic clinical syndrome, whereas older children may respond with a different clinical disease when exposed to the same viruses. Individual variation of response occurs; some persons will acquire an upper respiratory infection when exposed to respiratory pathogens, whereas other persons might have a more severe lower respiratory infection when exposed to the same pathogens. Some persons willr have up to ten Inc., 1973) , Vol. 20. ~' __., irregular; +, common; ++, prominent infections a year and others will have only one or two. Other factors affecting the frequency and type of illness a person might acquire include allergy, the presence of cardiopulmonary disease, genetic predisposition, geographic location, prior exposure to the same agent, physiologic state of the person, personal habits and season of the year. The communicability of the respiratory pathogen depends on the agent itself and the setting in which it is found. Certain agents spread poorly (adenoviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, Mycoplasma pnemnoniae); however, with close and prolonged contact or with crowding and poor personal hygiene, spread of these agents to susceptible contacts occurs. On the other hand, in open communities with considerable mobility of inhabitants, the transmission of respiratory agents may be limited.",

The so-called normal flora (Table 1) is continually changing and new strains of organisms replace their predecessors. Frequently, the flora is composed of potentially pathogenic organisms.

The psittacosis agent is large (250-450 nm. in diameter) and an obligatory intracellular parasite. It has a complex life cycle within the infected cell, with evidence that the large (800 nm.) initial body divides by binary fission, becoming smaller and smaller. These agents are susceptible to antimicrobial drugs such as penicillin and tetracycline, are sensitive to heat, ether and acid and produce complement-fixing, agglutinating and neutralizing antibodies in the course of infection.",

The causative agents are considered to be larvae of T. canis and T. cati. The life cycle of T. canis depends on the age and sex of the dog. Pups can be infected prenatally by larvae passing through the placenta or postnatally by ingestion of larvae or infected eggs. Larvae mature into adult worms in the upper alimentary tract (in about 3 weeks) and start laying eggs. Dormant larvae become mobile during pregnancy, migrating through the placenta into the fetus and causing prenatal infection. Once the bitch is infected she is probably capable of passing the infection on to several litters of puppies. When infective eggs of toxocara are swallowed by a human being, they hatch in the upper alimentary tract and the larvae enter the portal system, reaching the liver. The ova have thick shells and are quite resistant to adverse conditions. Some of the larvae migrate. from the liver to the lung and to the heart, where they reach the systemic circulation. Pulmonary involvement is common with this infection. Visceral larva migrans occurs mainly in young children. Most pulmonary infections due to a fungus occur sporadically and have worldwide distribution. Certain geographic areas of the world have a higher incidence of fungi and subsequently a higher prevalence of disease. Males are more frequently infected with fungal diseases than females. The prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroid therapy and anticancer drugs may contribute to whether or not a fungal infection becomes symptomatic, causing clinical disease.

Some studies have demonstrated dual infections (virus and bacteria) of the middle ear. This condition may occur when a viral infection causes primary damage followed by a bacterial infection. Since 50% or more cases of otitis media are associated with bacteria, all patients with this disease should be treated with appropriate antibiotics.

The paranasal sinuses are directly contiguous to and communicate, with the upper respiratory, tract; therefore, acute viral respiratory disease, allergic rhinitis, foreign bodies, deviation of the nasal septum and enlarged adenoids may obstruct the ostia of the sinuses, followed by bacterial invasion and acute infection. Although sinusitis is common, there are no exact data regarding frequency of occurrence. Fever, pain, tenderness and swelling over the involved sinus, the usual indication of sinusitis in the adult, is not usually present in the child (Fig. 1) . The child may have a profuse mucopurulent discharge from one or both nostrils, a cough, particialarly at night, and a diffusely red pharynx with a clinging, thick, mucopurulent discharge. The organisms most frequently responsible for sinusitis in the adult are S. attretts, hemolytic streptococcus, pneumococcus, H. inflttenzae and anaerobic organisms. Therapy should con- sist of symptomatic treatment, including codeine for severe pain, the use of moist heat over the alIccted sinuses and nose drops with a vasoconstrictor to promote drainage.

Over the years, it was realized that this type of pneumonia was caused by agents too small to be collected on a bacterial filter, therefore, the etiology was presumed to be viral. Despite the diversity of etiologic agents (viruses, rickettsia, mycoplasma, chlamydia) now known to be associated with primary atypical pneumonia, the clinical picture is more or less the same. The onset of the illness may be insidious, with cough, malaise, low-grade fever and headache. At times the illness begins with abrupt chilis, high fever, headache and severe body aches and pains. The cough, present from the start or developing later, is usually never very distressing. In contrast with lobar pneumonia, chest pain and respiratory distress are minimal. Chest x-rays show a confluent, hazy opacity spreading out from the hilus or involving segmental areas of the lung. Radiologic changes may be much more extensive than the clinical picture would suggest. The disease runs a benign tzourse and symptoms usually disappear in about l0 days, although the x-ray changes may persist for several weeks. Complications are rare.",

Unfortunately, difficulties still exist and vaccines available for acute respiratory diseases are few in number and not optimal in effectiveness.",

Except for specific diseases, such as diphtheria, the specific pneumonias, such as staphylococcus, and empyema, by definition, all upper respiratory infections, infections causing airway obstruction, upper-lower respiratory infections and lower respiratory infections may be caused by viruses. If the primary infection has a viral etiology, then antibiotic therapy is not indicated. Unfortunately, all of these syndromes also may be caused by bacterial agents, or secondary bacterial infections may follow primary viral infections--and therein lies the problem and the dilemma.",

If the history and physical examination determine that the patient has lobar pneumonia, acute epiglottitis or acute otitis media, then treatment must be initiated to prevent death or such severe complications as empyema, bacteremia and mastoiditis. On the other hand, if the patient has an upper respiratory infection or vesicular tonsillopharyngitis, then withholding antibiotic therapy until bacterial cul-turcs are available would be reasonable, since these diseases are almost always due to a virus. Unfortunately, the \"gray zone\" includes the vast majority of acute respiratory infections and these are the situations that tax the clinician's diagnostic acumen.",

Histoplasmosis.--When a previously uninfected person inhales dust containing the spores of Histoplasma capsulatttm, multiple small infiltrative areas form in the lungs. With a small infecting dose there is no illness, but with a large dose there is an acute illness, usually benign, 2 or 3 weeks after infection. After a few weeks of fever and sometimes months of poor health, complete recovery is the rule. Some heavily infected infants and children with poor general resistance die of generalized histoplasmosis. Other patients, usually middie-aged men, acquire a chronic cavitary lung disease resembling chronic pulmonary tuberculosis, with slow progression of disease toward a fatal outcome. Diagnosis is confirmed by a positive histoplasmin skin test, a complement fixation test and identification of H. capstdatttm in bronchial secretions. Amphotericin B is the chemotherapeutic agent of choice. The optimal dose, the duration of therapy and the total amount of drug needed for treatment of this disease are all not definitely known. Surgery is sometimes necessary to resect a solitary pulmonary nodule; general supportive care is important. E. Blastomycosis.--When infection with Blastomyces dermatitidis",
