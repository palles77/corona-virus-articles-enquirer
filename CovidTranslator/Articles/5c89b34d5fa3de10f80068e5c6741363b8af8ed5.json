The efficacy of parenteral administration of widely used modified live virus PRRS vaccine (PRRS-MLV) against genetically divergent PRRSV strains remains questionable. Therefore, we evaluated an alternate and proven mucosal immunization approach by intranasal delivery of PRRS-MLV (strain VR2332) with a potent adjuvant to elicit cross-protective immunity against a heterologous PRRSV (strain MN184). Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate (Mtb WCL) was chosen as a potent mucosal adjuvant due to its Th1 biased immune response to PRRS-MLV. Unvaccinated pigs challenged with MN184 had clinical PRRS with severe lung pathology; however, vaccinated (PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL) pigs challenged with MN184 were apparently healthy. There was a significant increase in the body weight gain in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated PRRSV challenged pigs. Vaccinated compared to unvaccinated, virus-challenged pigs had reduced lung pathology associated with enhanced PRRSV neutralizing antibody titers and reduced viremia. Immunologically, an increased frequency of Th cells, Th/memory cells, \u2425\u2426 T cells, dendritic cells, and activated Th cells and a reduced frequency of T-regulatory cells were detected at both mucosal and systemic sites. Further, reduced secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-\u2424) and upregulation of the Th1 cytokine IFN-\u2425 in blood and lungs were detected in mucosally vaccinated, PRRSVchallenged pigs. In conclusion, intranasal immunization of pigs with PRRS-MLV administered with Mtb WCL generated effective cross-protective immunity against PRRSV.",

The economic impact of PRRS alone to the US swine producers has been estimated to be approximately $560 million annually [1] . According to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) report of January 2009, overall, 49.8% of unvaccinated grower/finisher pigs were positive for PRRSV antibodies in the US (http://www.aphis. usda.gov/animal health/nahms/swine/downloads/swine2006/ Swine2006 is PRRS.pdf). As a member of the Arteriviridae family, PRRSV contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome [2] . PRRSV causes respiratory distress in pigs of all ages and reproductive failure in sows [3, 4] . Infection with this virus results in suppression of innate immune response (reduced IFN-\u2423 production and NK cell cytotoxicity) and a delay in the onset of adaptive immune response [5] [6] [7] .",

Currently, modified live and inactivated PRRSV vaccines have been licensed for use; however, these vaccines are not always efficacious in preventing PRRSV reinfections and transmission. There continue to be questions regarding vaccine safety and efficacy against existing as well as emerging antigenically heterologous PRRSV strains [9, 10] . Therefore, development of a broadly protective PRRSV vaccine has been a challenge to PRRSV researchers. Recently, PRRSV experts and researchers collectively agreed that only replicating PRRSV vaccines have the most promise in the field and successful protection can be achieved by improving the efficacy of live PRRSV vaccines (http://vetmed.illinois.edu/news/ PRRSwhitepaper.pdf).",

Nasopharyngeal MALT contains the entire repertoire of immune cells which are strategically located to orchestrate regional immune functions against airborne infections [11] . A majority of pathogens are transmitted through mucosal surfaces, but some of them cause disease primarily at these mucosal sites (e.g. Influenza, PRRSV, HIV, Rotavirus, etc.). It has been demonstrated that systemic stimulation of the immune system mainly results in systemic protection with low mucosal immune responses. Conversely, optimal stimulation of the mucosal immune system generates both mucosal and systemic immunity [12] . The mucosal immune system possesses strong immunoregulatory mechanisms to dampen inflammationinduced pathology; therefore, mucosal immunization generally results in tolerance in the absence of suitable adjuvants or delivery systems [13, 14] . Intranasal delivery of live attenuated vaccines against bovine herpes virus-1, influenza, and parainfluenza-3 when administered with adjuvants has proven effective [15, 16] . Intranasal delivery of influenza vaccine with a potent adjuvant resulted in effective cross protection due to immune responses generated against conserved internal viral proteins [17] . Thus, mucosal immunization may be an attractive method to induce PRRSV specific cross-protective immunity.",

            "text": "Design of an effective mucosal vaccine is not easy because the adjuvant/delivery system used must not elicit any toxicity and should overcome the host-and/or vaccine antigens-induced immunosuppression. Heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in an oil emulsion has been used extensively for experimental purposes as complete Freund's adjuvant [18] . Unfortunately, adverse effects mediated by major cell wall components of Mtb such as mycolic acids, peptidoglycan, and wax D preclude use of complete Freund's adjuvant in humans and food animals [19, 20] . Adjuvanticity of various purified individual components of Mtb have been investigated [21, 22] , including water soluble whole cell lysate (WCL) of Mtb [23] . Interestingly, a few of the Mtb WCL fractions, such as heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) [21, 24] and PE (Pro-Glu)/PPE (Pro-Pro-Glu) have been identified to elicit potent adjuvant activity [25, 26] . However, the knowledge related to mucosal adjuvanticity of Mtb WCL to mucosal viral vaccines is limited.",

The frequency of PRRSV specific IFN-\u2425-secreting cells was counted using an AID \u00ae ELISpot Reader System. The background values were subtracted from the respective counts of the unstimulated cells and the immune responses were expressed as the number of IFN-\u2425-secreting cells per million PBMC.

Studies have been reported on the PRRSV mediated proliferation of Tregs in infected pigs, indicating their involvement in disease progression [51] [52] [53] . In our study, a consistently reduced frequency of Tregs in the lungs, blood, and TBLN of pigs vaccinated intranasally with PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL was detected which was associated with reduced secretion of both the immunosuppressive cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-\u2424. Co-ordinated immunosuppressive functions of IL-10, TGF-\u2424, and Tregs have been reported [54, 55] . PRRSV increases the expression of TGF-\u2424 from myeloid cells, and TGF-\u2424 is essential for the de novo induction of Foxp3 and for the regulation of differentiation and function of Tregs in mice, humans, and pigs [52, 56] .",

The key cytokine associated with a host CMI response is IFN-\u2425 produced by NK cells, \u2425\u2426 T cells, Th cells, CTLs, and Th/memory cells [62] . In our study, reduced clinical PRRS and viremia in pigs vaccinated with PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL were associated with increased frequency of IFN-\u2425-secreting cells and increased levels of activated Th cells, memory/Th cells, and NK cells in both the lungs and blood. CD4CD8 double positive T cells possess memory, T-helper, and cytolytic properties. They are generally called Th/memory cells, and they also secrete IFN-\u2425 [41, 42] . This important T cell subset was associated with protection in pigs vaccinated against pseudorabies virus [41, 42] .",

The in vivo adjuvant effects of the water soluble fraction of Mtb WCL containing HSP70 resulted in rapid and prolonged activation of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells [21] . Consistent with that in our study, Mtb WCL-mediated, increased frequency of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells with reduced frequency of Tregs was detected. Importantly, this was associated with enhanced secretion of Th1 cytokines (IFN-\u2425) and downregulated secretion of immunosuppressive (IL-10 and TGF-\u2424) cytokines.",

In our prechallenge study, increased secretion of IL-6 in the lungs and blood of PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL inoculated pigs at DPV 7 and 15 was associated with enhanced PRRSV specific CMI responses [27] . In contrast, in the current study, reduced gross lung lesions observed in vaccinated, MN184 challenged pigs were associated with reduced secretion of IL-6.
