[10] [11] [12] Rt shows timedependent variation with the implementation of control measures. R >1 indicates that the outbreak is self-sustaining unless effective control measures are implemented, while R <1",

With more precise parameters obtained as the epidemic progresses, our estimation model will also be more precise. Our estimates of the reproductive number from 3.1 to 0.5 are based on previous studies and experience from SARS control. However, this measure may change substantially over the course of this epidemic and as additional data arrives. Besides, using a fixed Rt value in each phase may incur potential bias because Rt is essentially a dynamic parameter. Thirdly, these estimated data may not be sustained if unforeseeable factors occurred. For example, if some infections were caused by multiple exposures to animals, these estimates will be exposed to a big uncertainty. Fourthly, the epidemic trend shows great difference between Wuhan and Hubei Despite the limitations mentioned above, the current study is the first to provide estimation for epidemic trend after strict prevention and control measures were implemented in China.",

We estimated the number of infections using SEIR model under two assumptions of Rt (Rt maintaining to be >1 or Rt gradually decreasing to <1) in the purpose of depicting various possible epidemic trends of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Two estimations provide an approach for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China, depending on whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020. Assuming the current control measures were ineffective and insufficient, the estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without a peak.On the other hand, assuming the current control measures were effective and sufficient, the estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February 2020.According to Read's research, 13 R0 for COVID-19 outbreak is much higher compared with other emergent coronaviruses. It might be very difficult to contain or control the spreading of this virus.

Epidemic information has been released in an open, transparent, responsible and timely manner home and abroad. Cooperation has been established with other countries and international organizations.

The relatively big difference in number may be due to the possible existence of a large number of mild and asymptomatic cases and the imperfection of current diagnostic measures. According to NHC, before 12 February 2020, the confirmed cases were diagnosed according to contact history, clinical manifestations, chest X-ray or computer assisted tomography (CT) and RT-PCR for COVID-19. Since 12 February 2020, the diagnosis has been mainly based on contact history, clinical manifestation and imaging evidence of pulmonary lesion suggestive of pneumonia, while viral detection with RT-PCR is still being performed in a part of patients.23  After the diagnosis method was changed, a large number of cases that werepreviously missed and piled up for testing were reported in Wuhan, which greatly increased the number of existing cases and made it approaching our estimated number. A peak of the estimated number of infections would occur in late February under this assumption. If the peak does occur in February, the very strong measures China has taken may have already received success in controlling the COVID-19 infection in Wuhan. The number of deaths in the current study was estimated based on previously reported CFRs. Chen et al. calculated it to be 11% based on 99 cases at the very early stage of the outbreak. 6 This mortality rate might not be representative of the whole patients population due to the relatively small sample size and scarce knowledge about the virus at early stage. More recently, Yang et al. estimated the overall adjusted CFR among confirmed patients to be 3.06%with a sample size of8,866. 24  The number of deaths estimated accordingly might be more close All rights reserved.

Hubei Province, of which Wuhan is the capital city, accounts for more than 80% of newlyconfirmed cases all over the country according to NHC daily report. The current epidemic trend in Hubei Province is similar to that in Wuhan City. Considering the high number of confirmed cases in the province, the currently strict measures should be continuously implemented both in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province no matter whether the peak of number of infections would occur or not, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and to control the epidemic. Owing to the timely transportation restriction in Hubei Province and other measures, the number of newly-confirmed cases remains relatively low and has decreased for 13 days in a row in other provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in mainland China outside Hubei Province.",

Lastly, we do not provide model fit information in the current study. SEIR model is a prediction model forecasting the number of infections in the future.
