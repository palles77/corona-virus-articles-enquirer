Such patients should be seen later in the day when they are rested, with the dental chair positioned more upright to avoid further collapse of the airway. If available, longer dental chairs, or chairs which can be extended, are useful to increase patient comfort during treatment. Cortisol levels normally increase in the postoperative period following oral surgical procedures. This increase is blunted by the use of analgesics, strongly suggesting that the increased cortisol levels are a physiological response to pain. Hence in patients with Addison's disease, postoperative analgesia is extremely important. In view of this, if significant postoperative pain is expected, the patient's usual steroid dose may be doubled on the following day. Local anaesthesia Adrenocortical hypofunction does not affect the selection of local anaesthetic. Conscious sedation There are no contraindications regarding the use of conscious sedation. General anaesthesia The major determinant of secretion of ACTH and cortisol during surgery is recovery from general anaesthesia and extubation rather than the trauma of surgery itself. In these patients, steroid supplementation with 25 mg hydrocortisone at induction, followed by 100 mg/day for 48-72h are recommended. Patients with Addison's disease are best treated early in the day -when serum cortisol levels are highest.",

The response of pacemakers to interference is varied, usually temporary and only seen while the patient remains within range of the source of interference. The response largely depends on the interference signal characteristics and includes a single beat inhibition (where the pacemaker may not pace the heart for a single cardiac cycle), total inhibition (where the pacemaker ceases to pace the heart), asynchronous pacing (where the pacemaker paces the heart at a fixed rate), rate rise, or erratic pacing. \u25a0 Modern bipolar pacemakers have improved titanium-insulated interferenceresistant circuitry, and thus the risk of electromagnetic interference is very small \u25a0 The chief and real hazard to all pacemakers is with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because of static magnetic, alternating magnetic and radiofrequency (RF) fields produced by the MRI (Box 3.2) \u25a0 Some dental electrical devices capable of generating electromagnetic radiation may pose a low-grade threat to dental patients but usually only if the devices are placed in close approximation to the pacemaker (Box 3.2) \u25a0 Brief exposure of a pacemaker to electromagnetic anti-theft or surveillance devices, typically found in airports, shops and libraries, causes little, if any, disruption of function \u25a0 An implanted ICD in contrast, will not only trigger airport security alarms but also, the use of strong magnets over the device may adversely affect its function and even render it non-operational \u25a0 Digital mobile phones, and even television transmitters and faulty or badly earthed equipment, may cause interference -but the risk is very small and only when used in close proximity to the pacemaker \u25a0 Domestic electrical appliances -remote controls, CB radios, electric blankets, heating pads, shavers, sewing machines, kitchen appliances, and microwave ovens -are safe \u25a0 If a pacemaker does shut off, all possible sources of interference should be switched off and the patient given cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the supine position.",

Thus, it is important to conserve the remaining natural teeth, and fixed prostheses are the treatments of choice. Epilepsy and ataxia are usually contraindications for removable prostheses. Tooth wear may need treatment. Periodontology Periodontal disease is common, because soft tissue movement is abnormal and oral cleansing is impaired. Mouth breathing worsens the periodontal state.

Antiseptics such as chlorhexidine can be applied more effectively as a gel or spray rather than a mouthwash.

It ranges from pinholes compatible with survival into middle age, to defects so large as to cause death in infancy if untreated. There is a leftto-right shunt. Right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular failure, reversal of the shunt and late onset cyanosis may develop. The jet of blood hitting the endocardium of the right ventricle causes it to thicken (jet lesion) and it may later be the site of infective endocarditis. Ninety per cent of patients with ventricular septal defect have an additional cardiac defect. Repair is by primary closure, or a patch of pericardium or Dacron\u00ae. \u25a0 Atrial septal defect. This is often located near the foramen ovale, and termed a secundum defect and, in 10-20%, is associated with mitral valve prolapse. It has little effect on cardiac function, though right ventricular failure usually develops. It is therefore the most common CHD presenting in adults. An embolus from a vein can pass from the right ventricle into the left and therefore directly into the systemic circulation and can occasionally cause a stroke and be fatal (paradoxical embolism). Atrial septal defect is repaired by primary closure, or a pericardial or Dacron\u00ae patch. \u25a0 Patent ductus arteriosus. This is a persistent opening (normally closed by the third month of life) between the aorta and pulmonary artery. It causes loud and continuous sawing, systolic and diastolic murmurs. Shunt is from left to right, initially acyanotic, and the typical complication is right ventricular failure. If patency of the ductus is not necessary to maintain the systemic circulation, its closure can be promoted in infancy by giving indometacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor. Alternatively, it is ligated. \u25a0 Coarctation of the aorta. This is aortic narrowing, usually sited beyond the origin of the subclavian arteries -therefore the blood supply to the head, neck and upper body is unobstructed and only the supply to the lower part of the body is restricted. As a consequence, there is severe hypertension in the upper body and a low blood pressure below with strong radial pulses but weak or absent femoral pulses (radio-femoral delay). Secondary changes are enlargement of collateral arteries (such as the intercostal) and degenerative changes in the aorta, which can lead to a fatal aneurysm.",

Lower anterior teeth are usually severely affected and lost early. Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis is also seen. Individuals with DS have a raised prevalence of periodontal disease compared with otherwise normal, age-matched control groups and other patients with learning disability. The exaggerated immune-inflammatory response of the tissues cannot be explained by poor oral hygiene alone and might be the result of an impaired cell-mediated and humoral immunity and a deficient phagocytic system. As far as the progression and severity of destruction, this is consistent with an aggressive periodontitis disease pattern. \u25a0 In contrast, caries incidence is usually low in both dentitions, possibly related to the high salivary bicarbonate and pH.",

In drug allergy, the allergen is often a complex made up from the drug (hapten) and a host protein (transporter). Some risk factors that may increase the likelihood of developing a drug allergy include: \u25a0 Composition of drug (e.g. presence of additives) \u25a0 Grade of exposure (risk increases with repeated exposure) \u25a0 Route of administration (risk of a reaction increases with parenteral administration) \u25a0 Patient's susceptibility (conditioned by genetics, age, previous episodes of drug allergy and systemic immune disorders). Allergic drug reactions are more common in adults than children. Although atopy is not a risk factor, being atopic predisposes to a more severe reaction. \u25a0 Immunosuppression -may inhibit suppressor T cells regulating IgE antibody synthesis and so enhance the sensitising potential of some drugs. HIV disease has become a major risk factor for adverse drug reactions -over half of patients with AIDS develop adverse reactions when treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The incidence of reactions to ampicillin is inversely proportional to CD4+ cell counts. Several other drugs have a higher than expected tendency to produce adverse reactions in HIV-infected patients. Most are mild-to-moderate skin eruptions, but the risk of anaphylaxis and even toxic epidermal necrolysis may also be enhanced in HIV infection. \u25a0 Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome -an association between primary Sj\u00f6gren's and allergy has been suggested, with those individuals who are anti-Ro positive more at risk.",

Potent analgesics, such as narcotics, sedatives or antidepressants, may be needed and are certainly warranted in terminal disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) threestep analgesic ladder is a guideline for cancer pain management that has been shown to be effective in relieving pain for approximately 90% of patients with cancer and over 75% of cancer patients who are terminally ill. The five essential concepts in the WHO approach to drug therapy of cancer pain are: \u25a0 by the mouth \u25a0 by the clock \u25a0 by the ladder \u25a0 for the individual \u25a0 with attention to detail. Adjuvant drugs to enhance analgesic efficacy, treat concurrent symptoms that exacerbate pain, and provide independent analgesic activity for specific types of pain may be used at any step: \u25a0 Step 1, for mild to moderate pain, involves the use of paracetamol/ acetaminophen, aspirin, or another NSAID \u25a0 Step 2, when pain persists or increases, advises that an opioid such as codeine or hydrocodone should be added (not substituted) to the analgesic regimen. When higher doses of opioid are necessary, the third step is used. \u25a0 Step 3, for pain that is still persistent or moderate to severe, involves giving opioid and non-opioid analgesics separately, in order to avoid exceeding maximally recommended doses of paracetamol/ acetaminophen or NSAIDs. Drugs such as codeine or hydrocodone are used initially but may need to be replaced with more potent opioids (usually morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, methadone, fentanyl, or levorphanol) ( Table 3 .51). Morphine and diamorphine are the drugs of choice for severe pain but hydromorphone and oxycodone are of comparable efficacy and tolerability. Phentazocine may be valuable in patients intolerant of, or allergic to, morphine. Pethidine has too short an action and the metabolite norpethidine can accumulate in renal failure and then cause convulsions. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist and should be avoided. Dextromoramide is only very short-acting but can be useful to 'cover' painful procedures. Carbamazepine or tricyclic antidepressants may relieve pain due to the tumour infiltrating nerves. Transdermal fentanyl skin patches are increasingly used since they have an effect comparable with morphine and a duration of action of around 3 days. \u25a0 Medications for persistent cancer-related pain should be administered on an around-the-clock basis, with additional 'as-needed' doses, because regularly scheduled dosing maintains a constant level of drug in the body and helps to prevent a recurrence of pain.",

Benzodiazepines such as midazolam are anti-epileptogenic. However, seizures 175 Specific problem areas -EPILEPSY have occasionally been recorded in epileptics undergoing intravenous sedation with midazolam. Flumazenil is potentially epileptogenic. Nitrous oxide can increase the CNS depression in patients on anticonvulsants, and cause nausea and vomiting in patients under phenytoin. General anaesthesia Some GA agents may enhance the toxic effects of anticonvulsants.",

Fixed prosthetics and conservation Fixed prostheses with increased metal structure (better than porcelain) are recommended. Removable prosthetics There is a risk of oral injury and airway obstruction if removable prostheses fracture during a seizure.

Desmopressin cover just before surgery, and repeated 12-hourly if necessary for up to 4 days, is useful to cover minor surgery in some very mild haemophiliacs. It is given as an intranasal spray of 1.5mg desmopressin per mL with each 0.1mL pump spray delivering a 100-150\u00b5g dose, or as a slow intravenous infusion over 20 minutes of 0.3-0.5\u00b5g/kg.

Additional doses may be minimally effective and may even increase the bleeding time. \u25a0 Tranexamic acid (which is not FDA approved for use on the US market, where epsilon amino caproic acid is an alternative), is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine, which exerts an antifibrinolytic effect through the reversible blockade of lysine binding sites on plasminogen molecules. Tranexamic acid significantly reduces blood loss after surgery in patients with haemophilia and can be used topically or systemically. Systemically, it is given in a dose of 1 g (30mg/kg) orally, 4 times daily starting at least 1 hour preoperatively for surgical procedures, or as infusion 10 mg/kg in 20 mL normal saline over 20 minutes, then 1 gm tds orally for 5 days (child dose is 20mg/kg). However, nausea is a common adverse effect and antifibrinolytics must not be used systemically where residual clots are present, because clots may form in the urinary tract or intracranially. These problems have led to the development of topical preparations, typically 5% solutions w/v, often used as a mouthwash 10mL qds for 1-2 weeks after dental extractions and/or applied to gauze swabs placed over the bleeding socket.",

A non-traumatic needle must be used, and the number of sutures minimised. Vicryl sutures are preferred as they usually remain in situ for over 4 days. Non-resorbable sutures such as black silk, if used, should be removed at 4-7 days. \u2022 Although suturing carries with it the risk, if there is postoperative bleeding, of causing blood to track down towards the mediastinum with danger to the airway, this complication is usually an indication of inadequate preoperative replacement therapy, or more rarely the presence of Factor VIII inhibitors \u2022 In the case of difficult extractions, when mucoperiosteal flaps must be raised, the lingual tissues in the lower molar regions should preferably be left undisturbed since trauma may open up planes into which haemorrhage can track and endanger the airway. The buccal approach to lower third molars is therefore safer. \u2022 Minimal bone should be removed and the teeth should be sectioned for removal where possible \u2022 Topical haemostatic agents introduced into the base of the sockets may be of use. Agents used include collagen, cyanoacrylate, fibrin glues, and oxidised cellulose soaked in tranexamic acid (Table 3 .62). Fibrin sealant, which consists mainly of fibrinogen and thrombin, provides rapid haemostasis as well as tissue sealing and adhesion (commercial, viral-inactivated products are available in Europe, Canada, and Japan). Liquid fibrin sealant (LFS) has been used but fibrin glue is unavailable in USA, because of the risk of viral infections, and concern regarding CJD; recombinant fibrin glues are becoming available. \u2022 Tranexamic acid mouthwash (used either as a mouthwash, or as a swish/swallow technique) is a helpful adjunct \u2022 Postoperatively, a diet of cold liquid and pureed/soft solids should be taken for up to 5-10 days \u2022 Infection may also induce fibrinolysis by secondary haemorrhage, so antimicrobials, such as 191 Specific problem areas -HAEMOPHILIA A oral penicillin V 250mg or amoxicillin 500 mg 4 times daily given postoperatively for a full course of 7 days, may be considered \u2022 Acrylic protective splints are now rarely used, in view of their liability to cause mucosal trauma and to promote sepsis, but they are sometimes useful in sites such as the palate \u25a0 Care should be taken to watch for haematoma formation that may manifest itself by swelling, dysphagia or hoarseness. The patency of the airway must always be ensured. \u25a0 Compounding factors, such as thrombocytopenia in HIV-infected haemophiliacs, should be considered. Maxillofacial surgery \u25a0 Factor VIII replacement is essential for all haemophiliacs \u25a0 The dose of factor VIII given before operation depends both on the severity of haemophilia and the amount of trauma expected. A Factor VIII level of between (at least) 75% and (better) 100% is required for maxillofacial surgery. Factor VIII must be given 1 hour preoperatively and regularly at least twice daily postoperatively for major surgery. \u25a0 Before maxillofacial surgery, the patient is assessed by haemostatic screening (APTT, PT, platelet count), Factor VIII assay, specific antibody test, fibrinogen estimation, hepatitis B, C and HIV tests, and liver function tests \u25a0 Blood is also grouped and cross-matched for use in emergency \u25a0 Bleeding is most likely on the day of operation or from 4 to 10 days 192 Special care in dentistry postoperatively. Trauma to the head and neck \u25a0 Haemophiliacs with head and neck injuries are at risk from bleeding into the cranial cavity or into the fascial spaces of the neck -they must, therefore, be given Factor VIII to achieve a level of 100% prophylactically after head or facial trauma 193 Specific problem areas -HAEMOPHILIA A \u25a0 If there are only lacerations that need suturing, a minimum level of Factor VIII of 50% is required at the time, with further cover for 3 days. Fixed prosthetics and conservation \u25a0 Soft tissue trauma must be avoided. Care must be taken not to let the matrix band cut the periodontal tissues and start gingival bleeding. A rubber dam is useful to protect the mucosa from trauma but the clamp must be carefully applied. Cotton wool rolls should be moistened to avoid adherence to the mucosa, which may result in mucosal bleeding when they are removed. High-speed vacuum aspirators and saliva ejectors must be used with caution in order to avoid production of haematomas. Trauma from the saliva ejector can be minimised by resting it on a gauze swab placed in the floor of the mouth. Tranexamic acid mouthwash may be of use to control local bleeding. \u25a0 Subgingival restorations may be placed with the use of haemostatic solutions such as for gingival retraction (e.g. Racestyptine) or locally applied LA containing epinephrine, to control gingival bleeding. Endodontics \u25a0 Endodontic treatment may obviate the need for extractions and can usually be carried out without special precautions other than care to avoid instrumenting through the tooth apex \u25a0 Intracanal injection of LA solution containing epinephrine or topical application (with paper points) of epinephrine 1:1000 may be useful to minimise bleeding \u25a0 However, in severe haemophilia, bleeding from the pulp and periapical tissues can be persistent and troublesome, and factor replacement may need to be considered.

Several drugs active against retroviruses (anti-retroviral drugs) are available though costly and often associated with resistance and/or adverse reactions. Some specific anti-retroviral agent combinations, the so-called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), show an especially increased antiviral activity. Specific drug groups include nucleoside analogues, protease (proteinase) inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (Box 3.14). Patients are usually monitored by CD4 counts and plasma viral load since these correlate well with clinical progress; at counts below 200/ L patients are at high risk of Pneumocystis carinii infection, and at counts below 100/ L, CMV and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare are more commonly present. Management of co-morbid conditions There has been a growing recognition that many individuals who become HIV infected also have, or are vulnerable to, a host of co-morbid conditions, including other infectious diseases (e.g. fungal/viral infections, hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections [STIs], tuberculosis), substance abuse, mental illness and homelessness. The risks and the consequences of HIV infection for these individuals must be evaluated and addressed in the context of these other conditions: \u25a0 Additional drug therapy may be required to manage the infections/tumours associated with HIV/AIDS. This may include anti-viral and anti-fungal therapy. \u25a0 Social and psychological support -the positive diagnosis of HIV infection is often extremely disturbing for a patient and counselling is critical. Newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients often face the emotionally demanding task of communicating their test results to a partner and family members. In both gay and heterosexual couples, patients may feel extreme remorse over the possibility of having infected their partners. Conversely, patients may be angry about the likelihood that they were infected by their partners. Furthermore, the patient's immediate family will often have strong, conflicting reactions to the news of the patient's HIV test results. \u25a0 Some patients testing positive may become increasingly depressed and suicidal and need close monitoring and long-term psychological support.

This is best achieved by leaving only saveable teeth and removing any of dubious prognosis at least 10 days to 2 weeks before starting radiotherapy. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) may help prevent ORN. \u25a0 ORN is managed with prophylactic antibiotics; typically the signs and symptoms of inflammation clear within a few weeks \u25a0 Complete resolution can, however, take 2 or more years despite intensive antimicrobial treatment. Hyperbaric oxygen and possibly surgical bone decortication may be required.",

The increased risk of infection is related to: \u2022 defective phagocyte function, which results from impaired interleukin-2 (IL-2), but increases in other cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor) \u2022 some patients are also immunosuppressed. \u25a0 Consideration must also be given to the effect on dental management of underlying diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, myelomatosis and amyloidosis, or complications such as peptic ulceration \u25a0 Major surgical procedures may be complicated by hyperkalaemia as a result of tissue damage, acidaemia and blood transfusion.

The main management problems in patients in CRF include: Bleeding tendencies \u25a0 The renal physician/haematologist should first be consulted \u25a0 Although dialysis overall improves platelet function, the patient is often heparinised to facilitate it -hence treatment should not be undertaken on the same day as dialysis \u25a0 Careful haemostasis should be ensured if surgical procedures are necessary \u25a0 Should bleeding be prolonged, desmopressin (DDAVP) may achieve haemostasis for up to 4 hours. If this fails, cryoprecipitate may be effective, has a peak effect at 376 Special care in dentistry 4-12 hours and lasts up to 36 hours. Conjugated oestrogens may aid haemostasis: the effect takes 2-5 days to develop but persists for 30 days. Infections \u25a0 Infections can be difficult to recognise as signs of inflammation are masked \u25a0 Odontogenic infections should be treated vigorously \u25a0 Haemodialysis predisposes to blood-borne viral infections such as hepatitis virus infections \u25a0 Tuberculosis is also more frequent, but is usually extrapulmonary and therefore does not constitute a risk to dental staff.

This has a series of letters or letters and numbers, with the largest at the top. As the person being tested reads down the chart, the letters gradually become smaller. \u2022 When checking visual acuity, one eye is covered at a time and the vision of each eye is recorded separately, as well as both eyes together. Normal vision is 20/20, which means that the eye being tested can read a certain size letter when it is 20 feet away. If a person sees 20/40, then at 20 feet from the chart that person can read letters that a person with 20/20 vision could read from 40 feet away. The 20/40 letters are twice the size of 20/20 letters; however, if 20/20 is considered 100% visual efficiency, 20/40 visual acuity is 85% efficient. \u2022 For people who have worse than 20/400 vision, a different eye chart can be used.

Sound levels seem lower. \u25a0 Sensorineural hearing loss results from damage to the inner ear (cochlea), auditory nerve or the central connections. This type of hearing loss is permanent. The affected person has difficulty hearing clearly, understanding speech, and interpreting various sounds. \u25a0 Mixed hearing loss occurs when a person has both conductive and sensorineural hearing problems.Aetiopathogenesis Conductive hearing loss May occur in association with: \u25a0 craniofacial congenital disorders (e.g. first arch defects, cleft palate) \u25a0 chronic infection \u25a0 trauma \u25a0 'glue' ear in children. Sensorineural hearing loss May be consequence of: \u25a0 genetic disorders interfering with the development of the inner ear and auditory nerve \u25a0 injuries, such as a skull fracture \u25a0 complications during pregnancy or birth, such as infections (e.g. rubella) or other illnesses; premature babies are at increased risk for hearing impairment \u25a0 infections or illnesses: mumps, measles, chickenpox, repeated otitis media \u25a0 brain tumours \u25a0 drugs, such as some antibiotics (e.g. aminoglycosides, including gentamicin) and chemotherapy drugs \u25a0 loud noise -a sudden loud noise (e.g. explosion) or exposure to high noise levels over time (e.g. pop music or road drills) can cause permanent damage to the cochlea.",

Although 5-10% of these carriers lose the hepatitis antigen each year, carriers may remain positive for up to 20 years and may not be suspected clinically. However, certain groups of patients -especially those who have received blood products, those infected with HDV and those who have immune defects -are predisposed to the carrier state. Most carriers are healthy but others, especially those with persistently abnormal liver function tests, develop chronic liver disease, which causes death in 15-25% of cases. \u25a0 In the absence of complications, infection with hepatitis B virus confers immunity. Active immunity can therefore be acquired naturally.",

If anticoagulants are to be continued after the operation, vitamin K should be avoided, as it makes subsequent anticoagulation difficult. Generally, heparin and warfarin overlap for approximately 4 days. Discontinue heparin once the INR is at the required therapeutic level.

The buccal approach to lower third molar removal is therefore safer. \u25a0 Where possible, minimal bone should be removed and the teeth should be sectioned for removal \u25a0 Bleeding should be assessed intraoperatively -if there is concern, an absorbable haemostatic agent should be placed in the extraction site, such as oxidised regenerated cellulose, resorbable gelatin sponge or collagen (synthetic or microcrystalline or porcine). Cyanoacrylate or fibrin glues, which consist mainly of fibrinogen and thrombin, provide rapid haemostasis as well as tissue sealing and adhesion. Commercial, viral-inactivated products are available in Europe, Canada and Japan, but recombinant fibrin products are preferable. \u25a0 Suturing is desirable to stabilise flaps and to prevent postoperative disturbance of wounds when eating.

The best known agent is tranexamic acid which is not FDA approved for use on the US market, where epsilon amino caproic acid is an alternative. Tranexamic acid, a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine, exerts an antifibrinolytic effect through the reversible blockade of lysine binding sites on plasminogen molecules. Systemic tranexamic acid does not result in 451 Specific problem areas -WARFARINISATION therapeutic concentrations in saliva. Topical tranexamic acid is effective even when the anticoagulant therapy remains unchanged.

Epsilon aminocaproic acid (250 mg/mL) 25% syrup 5-10mL is an alternative. \u25a0 Infection appears to induce fibrinolysis and therefore antimicrobials, such as oral penicillin V 250-500 mg four times daily (or clindamycin), may be given postoperatively for a full course of 7 days if there is risk of secondary haemorrhage \u25a0 For postoperative pain management, paracetamol (acetaminophen) is recommended as the analgesic and antipyretic of choice for short-term use (see below) in patients on oral anticoagulant therapy, and is preferred to NSAIDs since it does not affect platelets. Codeine is a suitable alternative analgesic. \u25a0 A diet of cool liquid and minced solids should be taken for several days \u25a0 Postoperative prolonged bleeding should be controlled by biting on a moist gauze, or a gauze pad soaked in tranexamic acid, or a moist tea bag with firm pressure for 30 minutes \u25a0 Faced with a patient with persistent bleeding it is important to establish if the situation is urgent, when the patient will require admission for intravenous fluids, or reversal of anticoagulation -this may well be the case if the patient is losing large quantities of blood or hypotensive (hypovolaemic) \u2022 To stop oral bleeding, wash out clots with warm saline and identify the bleeding area. Put in a local anaesthetic injection containing epinephrine and press firmly with a sterile gauze pad soaked with tranexamic acid over the extraction socket for 10-15 minutes. \u2022 If this is unsuccessful, press with fingers on either side of the socket. If the bleeding stops, suture the socket; using silk sutures to enable a tighter suturing. \u2022 If the bleeding does not stop with simple pressure, pack the socket with a resorbable haemostatic agent and then suture \u2022 If the patient continues to bleed, consult a physician about reversal of warfarin since this is best achieved with a prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
