The illness may be life-threatening, particularly in the very young and very old. Control of gastroenteritis associated with microbial infection is therefore an important aspect of preventive medicine. Laboratory investigations are necessary to establish the source of an outbreak, to determine whether chemotherapy is necessary as it is in, for example, Giardia lamblia infection and to identify long-term changes in the pattern of infections related to altered dietary habits and other social factors. In this survey we draw attention to the many infective agents which have to be considered in the investigation of cases and outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The examination of faecal samples in the microbiology laboratory is becoming increasingly complex requiring as it does the use of additional new techniques for previously unrecognised bacterial, viral and protozoal causes of gastroenteritis including, in the last two decades, Campylobacter, Clostridiurn difficile, rotavirus, Norwalk virus and Cryptosporidium. These investigations are however expensive and in the face of increasing pressure to economise, it is of paramount importance that the best use should be made of the resources available. To this end we make recommendations about the information that should accompany faecal and other samples submitted to the laboratory from outbreaks of gastroenteritis.",

Although vomiting and diarrhoea of short duration in individuals is common and not a serious problem, spread of infection by the faecal-oral route may lead to outbreaks with numerous cases in families, institutions including hospitals, day nurseries and schools and among persons attending large social functions. Gastroenteritis associated with rapid fluid loss may be life-threatening particularly in the very young and very old and prevention is very important in, for example, maternity and special care baby units and in geriatric wards. Laboratory investigations show that a wide range of micro-organisms may be responsible for outbreaks of gastroenteritis some of which have only recently been added to the list of those taken into account by microbiologists carrying out tests on faecal samples. Thus, to long-recognised organisms such as Salmonella, Shigella, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EEC), Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus and Giardia lamblia must now be added others including Campylobacter, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila, enterotoxigenic (ETC), enteroinvasive (EIC) and verotoxin-producing strains of E. coli, Clostridium difficile, Bacillus cereus, Cryptosporidium and enteropathogenic viruses including, most commonly, rotavirus and Norwalk virus.

Moreover monitoring of the prevalence of gastroenteritis and the causative agents reveals changes reflecting, for example, altered dietary habits and other social factors. These include the greatly increased consumption of mass-produced food of animal origin, notably poultry, and the much larger proportion of people who take holidays abroad during the summer.

Infection by person-to-person transmission is less common, except in, for example, clinical situations involving infants or elderly and incontinent persons or, in the household, close family contacts. By antigenic analysis about 2,000 Salmonella serotypes can be identified and the more common of these have been further divided in phage types (PT's). Thus there are 232 PT's of S. typhimurium and 32 PT's of S. enteritidis but in both cases a small minority of the PT's account for most of the infections in man. Accurate recognition of sources of infection depends on the use of these typing systems to 'finger-print' salmonellas which are widely distributed, often without causing disease, in animals that are sources of human food such as cattle, pigs or poultry and, as a result, frequently cause infection in man when there are lapses in standards of cooking or hygiene. Epidemiological typing is therefore an essential part of the laboratory investigation of salmonella infections.",

This is the enteritidis PT most commonly isolated from chickens and eggs including some batches of liquid egg and these are probably the food sources mainly responsible for the rapid increase in human S. enteritidis infections. There was however an outbreak of 12 cases of S. enteritidis PT8 infection in 1985 at an old people's home and 35 cases of S. enteritidis PT6 in 1986 including many in travellers returning from Spain and Portugal.",

This is in sharp contrast to the practice in most hospital laboratories of submitting all Salmonella cultures to PHL for further investigation including many from general practitioner patients.

The patients investigated included those involved in 24 outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the community, 3 in childrens' units, 21 in homes for old people, and 27 outbreaks in hospitals, 2 in paediatric, 2 ! in geriatric and 4 in general wards. Rotavirus or Norwalk virus were detected in 9 (18%) of the 51 outbreaks investigated (Table IX) , ",

            "text": "It is clear that control of gastroenteritis in the community is an important aspect of preventive medicine. In severe cases the symptoms are very distressing and the illness may be life-threatening particularly in the very young and very old. At all ages however there may be serious social disruption. Persons affected must take time off work or school and exclusion, for a time, of employees in high-risk occupations such as nursing or food-handling is necessary. Children have to be excluded from day nurseries and schools affecting attendance of parents at work. Gastrointestinal infection acquired at a social function is a disaster when large numbers of guests are affected. Gastroenteritis is often a disturbing accompaniment or aftermath of foreign travel. In this survey in an almost entirely urban area we draw attention to the many infective agents which have to be considered in the laboratory investigation of cases and outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The examination of faecal samples in the microbiology laboratory is becoming increasingly complex requiring as it does the use of additional new techniques for previously unrecognised bacterial, viral and protozoal causes of gastroenteritis including, in the last two decades, Campylobacter, Clostridium di~cile, rotavirus, Norwalk virus and Cryptosporidium. To cover all, or most, possibilities it is now necessary to employ a wide range of techniques which may include as many as 12 different solid or liquid culture media incubated aerobically and anaerobically and at 3 different incubator temperatures, 30\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C and 43\u00b0C; light microscopy of stained and unstained preparations; electron microscopy and either tissue culture or latex agglutination for detection of bacterial toxin. In addition to work in the laboratory that receives the specimens, it is necessary in some cases for specialised investigations to be undertaken by the Division of Enteric Pathogens, Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale Avenue (DEP) including tests for enterotoxin and epidemiological typing, for example, phage typing which may be necessary to define the source and pattern of spread of an outbreak. An example of this was the nationwide outbreak early in 1988 of Salmonella typhimurium PT124 infections traced to imported salami and halted after investigation by Communicable Diseases Surveillance Centre (CDSC) based on case-control studies of patients from whom this STM phage type had been isolated. Plasmid profiles may also be used increasingly in future in this field.",

            "text": "It may be argued that laboratory investigation of gastroenteritis is often unnecessary because, for most cases, specific chemotherapy is not recommended and because in 'high-risk' situations persons with diarrhoea are excluded irrespective of the results of laboratory tests. It is important however to take into account that specific treatment is required for patients with Giardia lamblia infections including symptomless carriers often identified among contacts of clinical cases. Also the epidemiology of gastroenteritis caused by different organisms varies so much that it is necessary to identify the agent responsible for an outbreak before appropriate and effective measures can be taken to bring it under control and prevent a recurrence. Precise identification of the cause of cases of gastroenteritis can only be achieved by microbiological examination of faecal samples or, in the case of some types of food-poisoning, the food thought to be responsible for the illness. In some food-related outbreaks, the length of the incubation period may give an important clue to the diagnosis, for example, 2 to 4 hours for staphylococcal food-poisoning, but laboratory investigation is necessary to identify the source of infection with certainty.",

There were however in this age group 6 cases of S. enteritidis PT8 infection in 1985 which were evidently not epidemiologically related. The decline in numbers ofS. typhimurium cases from 219 in 1983 to 87 in 1987 cannot be explained because of the variety of phage types involved indicating many different sources and routes of infection. In the earlier years however there were several large outbreaks of S. typhimurium infection. In 1983 there were outbreaks at 2 social functions of PT99 (9 persons) and PT135 (26 persons), in 1985 a hospital outbreak of PT12 (23 persons) 3 and in 1986 an outbreak of PT110 (14 identified cases) at a medical students ball. Campylobacter infections Since Skirrow 4 reported the first cases of Campylobacter infection recognised in UK, laboratory investigations have shown that these outnumber Salmonella infections among cases of gastroenteritis not associated with large outbreaks. Special techniques are required in the laboratory to detect campylobacters and much of the rapid increase in cases reported to CDSC during the 1980's has been the result of the successful use of these techniques by an increasing number of laboratories.
