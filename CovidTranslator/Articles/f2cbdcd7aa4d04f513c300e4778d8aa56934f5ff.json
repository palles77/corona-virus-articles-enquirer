            "text": "Six poliovirus-neutralizing Fabs were recovered from a combinatorial Fab phage display library constructed from bone marrow-derived lymphocytes of immunized chimpanzees. The chimeric chimpanzee-human fulllength IgGs (hereinafter called monoclonal antibodies [MAbs]) were generated by combining a chimpanzee IgG light chain and a variable domain of heavy chain with a human constant Fc region. The six MAbs neutralized vaccine strains and virulent strains of poliovirus. Five MAbs were serotype specific, while one MAb cross-neutralized serotypes 1 and 2. Epitope mapping performed by selecting and sequencing antibodyresistant viral variants indicated that the cross-neutralizing MAb bound between antigenic sites 1 and 2, thereby covering the canyon region containing the receptor-binding site. Another serotype 1-specific MAb recognized a region located between antigenic sites 2 and 3 that included parts of capsid proteins VP1 and VP3. Both serotype 2-specific antibodies recognized antigenic site 1. No escape mutants to serotype 3-specific MAbs could be generated. The administration of a serotype 1-specific MAb to transgenic mice susceptible to poliovirus at a dose of 5 g/mouse completely protected them from paralysis after challenge with a lethal dose of wild-type poliovirus. Moreover, MAb injection 6 or 12 h after virus infection provided significant protection. The MAbs described here could be tested in clinical trials to determine whether they might be useful for treatment of immunocompromised chronic virus excretors and for emergency protection of contacts of a paralytic poliomyelitis case.",

            "text": "Poliomyelitis is an infectious neurological disease that is caused by polioviruses of three distinct serological types. Two highly effective vaccines, one prepared from formalin-inactivated virulent virus and another from live attenuated strains administered orally, were developed in the 1950s (35, 36) . Their worldwide use resulted in almost complete eradication of the disease, with only a few countries remaining in which it is endemic and a few thousand paralytic cases annually. This dramatic success diminished interest in the development of new protective measures, as complete eradication of poliomyelitis was perceived to be very close. However, the original eradication target date of 2000 was missed by at least 10 years due to a variety of scientific, logistical, and political obstacles (13) . Therefore, in recent years, the setbacks in the global efforts to eradicate poliomyelitis, newly recognized challenges of the final phases of the WHO-coordinated campaign, and the need to prevent the reemergence of poliomyelitis in the posteradication period led to renewed efforts to develop more efficient vaccines, new strategies for their use, and other tools to protect against poliomyelitis (17, 27, 31) . They include licensure of more potent monovalent and bivalent oral polio vaccines (mOPV and bOPV, respectively), the development of a new generation of inactivated poliovirus vaccines for use in the posteradication period (8, 14) , and the development of drugs effective against poliovirus (10, 29) .",

It has also led to the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) (21) and immunodeficiency-associated VDPV (iVDPVs) (25) . VDPVs of the first type cause outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis in inadequately immunized communities and are indistinguishable from wild polioviruses in their pathogenic properties. iVDPVs emerge in OPV-vaccinated individuals with primary B-cell immunodeficiencies and can establish chronic infection and be excreted into the environment for several years (20, 24) . Besides the immediate danger to the chronic carriers (some of the patients eventually become paralyzed by the continuously evolving poliovirus), the presence of chronic excretors poses a serious challenge to the polio eradication campaign, providing an ample source of virulent polioviruses in the environment, making it impossible to halt immunization against poliomyelitis (12) . Therefore, finding an effective treatment for these patients is an important public health objective. In 2006, the U.S. National Research Council recommended the development of at least two polio antiviral drugs to treat chronically infected individuals and to assist in the management of outbreaks in the posteradication period (10) .",

Therefore, passive immunotherapy could be another way to treat chronic excretors. Even though prior attempts to use intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and breast milk were unsuccessful (22) , there is reason to think that higher doses of antipoliovirus antibodies could result in complete clearance of poliovirus from chronically infected individuals. In this communication, we report the development of hybrid chimpanzee-human antipoliovirus immunoglobulins that could be used in clinical trials to assess their effectiveness for the treatment of chronic poliovirus excretors, as well as for postexposure emergency prophylaxis and disease prevention if there is a reemergence of poliomyelitis in the posteradication period.",

Amounts of 0.5 to 1.0 D antigen units/ml of poliovirus were captured on 96-well ELISA plates coated with purified rabbit polyclonal serotype-specific IgG (2 g/ml). Then, some wells containing captured antigen were incubated with serial dilutions of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) or polyclonal serum (blocking reaction), while control wells were treated with normal rabbit serum. Wells with no antigen served as a background control. Antipoliovirus antibodies reacted with their respective antigenic sites and blocked them from subsequent reaction with biotin-conjugated polyclonal antipolio IgG (0.5 g/ml). Next, ExtrAvidin-peroxidase conjugate (1:1,000 dilution; Sigma) was added, and the reaction of bound peroxidase with tetramethylbenzidine substrate (TMB, Sigma) resulted in the development of a color reaction. After the addition of a stop reagent (Sigma), the plate was scanned at 450 nm. The OD 450 in the background wells that contained no antigen corresponded to 100% blocking activity, and the OD 450 for antigen-containing wells incubated with normal rabbit serum corresponded to 0% blocking activity. The percentage of blocking activity of a specific MAb or serum with a particular antigen was calculated from the difference between the average ODs of blocked and nonblocked wells containing the same antigen. The final results for blocking of reactivity were calculated from the following formula: % blocking activity \u03ed (average OD for wells containing normal rabbit serum \u03ea average OD for wells containing test serum)/(average OD for wells with normal rabbit serum \u03ea average OD for background wells with no antigen). The titer was defined as a serum dilution producing 50% blocking. Graphical linearization of S-shaped blocking ELISA titration curves was performed by plotting the logarithm of blocking activity/(1 \u03ea blocking activity) against the logarithm of dilution.",

The sequencing analysis of the variable domain of heavy (V H ) and light (V L ) chains showed that nine clones specific to serotype 1, three clones specific to serotype 2, and seven clones specific to serotype 3 were recovered. These positive clones were subsequently converted to produce soluble Fabs. Each soluble Fab was confirmed for its specific binding to its panning antigen (Table 1) . Further measurement of their neutralization activities by PRNT showed that Fabs A12 and H2, Fabs A6 and B2, and Fabs B10, A2, E3, and C10 neutralized Sabin poliovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Table 1) . Six Fab clones (A12, H2, A6, B2, B10, and C10) had relatively higher neutralizing activities and, therefore, were selected for conversion to fulllength IgGs (referred to hereinafter as MAbs) and further characterization. The closest human V-gene germ line usage and possible somatic mutations for each of these six poliovirusneutralizing MAbs were identified by conducting sequence similarity searches of all of the known human Ig genes compiled in the IMGT database at http://www.imgt.org/. The analysis showed that family 3 of heavy chain genes and family 1 of kappa chain genes were overrepresented. Both V H and V L genes were highly mutated, since identities of 85 to 90% for V H and 90 to 96% for V L in comparison to germ line V-gene were observed ( Table 2 ), suggesting that significant affinity maturation may have taken place.",

MAbs B10 and C10 that were recovered from panning against type 3 poliovirus reacted well with Sabin 3 (Fig. 1C) . Sabin 3 virus also reacted weakly with type 1-specific MAbs A12 and H2. Direct ELISA may not necessarily reflect functional inter-actions that lead to neutralization because it can detect relatively weak binding between antibodies and antigens. Previously, we showed that the blocking ELISA procedure in which MAbs are used to compete with neutralizing polyclonal serum is much more predictive of the functional interactions and that its results correlate well with neutralization test results (32) . The results in Table 3 show that, indeed, weak interactions between type 1-specific antibodies A12 and H2 and Sabin 3 poliovirus that were detected in a previous experiment did not occur in this setting. However, type 1-specific A12 antibody strongly reacted with type 2 poliovirus, suggesting that it may neutralize two serotypes of poliovirus. In another experiment, the blocking ELISA was performed with various concentrations of MAbs using both attenuated Sabin and wild polioviruses as antigens (Fig. 2) . With the exception of type 3-specific MAb B10 that reacted equally well with the Sabin 3 and wild Saukett strains, all other MAbs reacted better with Sabin strains than with wild strains of the same serotype. The difference was especially pronounced for type 2-specific antibody A6 that practically did not block wild MEF-1 poliovirus. Table 4 showed that all MAbs selected against each serotype effectively neutralized homotypic viruses. In addition, and consistent with the ELISA data, the A12 MAb neutralized both type 1 and type 2 polioviruses. While some MAbs, such as A12 and H2, neutralized both Sabin and wild strains of poliovirus, others exhibited a significant bias for Sabin strains. The neutralizing titer of MAb A6 tested against wild MEF-1 was more than 1,000 times lower than against the Sabin 2 strain. MAbs B2, B10, and C10 had about 10-to 100-fold lower neutralizing activities against wild-type than against Sabin strains.",

In contrast, mutation G 1225 D, which makes the Sabin 2 strain resistant to the same A12 antibody, is located on the opposite side of the canyon and is part of antigenic site 2. Thus, it appears that A12 binds the virion by interacting with both sides of the canyon, at the bottom of which the binding site for cellular receptor is located (3, 9, 42) .",

To determine whether the MAbs can protect against poliomyelitis in vivo, we intravenously inoculated Tg-21PVR transgenic mice expressing human poliovirus receptor CD155 with various doses of H2 MAb and challenged them intramuscularly with 10 50% paralytic doses (PD 50 ) of wild poliovirus (Mahoney strain). Table 6 shows that 1 g of MAb protected 30% of the mice and 5 g protected 100%. The average neutralizing titers in serum in the 5-g and 1-g groups were 1:32 and 1:9, respectively, consistent with the common notion that a neutralization titer of 1:8 protects against polio. The protective effect of the MAbs is quite predictable, considering the high potency of the antibodies. It is also important to determine whether the antibodies could be used to prevent paralytic disease if administered after exposure to the virus. The results shown in Table 7 demonstrate that some mice survived challenge with a 5-PD 50 dose if they were treated with 5 or 25 g of H2 antibody at either 6 or 12 h after infection. There was a clear protective effect, even though not all mice survived. This observation suggests that these antibodies could be used for emergency prophylaxis of nonimmune individuals exposed to poliovirus.",

Elucidation of the molecular structure of poliovirus and the introduction of MAb technology allowed epitopes to mouse MAbs to be mapped on the surface of polio virions. Mutations rendering poliovirus resistant to MAbs identify epitopes with which the antibodies interact. Epitopes to different MAbs are clustered into several structural regions (antigenic sites) on the surface of polio virions (18, 40) . Studies with three serotypes of poliovirus identified three or four such antigenic sites. Antigenic site 1 is composed of the so-called B-C loop and the adjacent regions within VP1, while three other antigenic sites are composed of a combination of different capsid proteins, in some cases belonging to adjacent capsomers. Most poliovirus epitopes are believed to be conformational and are very sensitive to disruption of the virion structure.",

The MAbs from chimpanzees, the closest relatives of humans, described in this paper support this notion. One interesting observation is the dual specificity of antibody A12. It binds and neutralizes both type 1 and type 2 polioviruses. The results of our cross-neutralization experiments with hyperimmune rabbit antisera suggest that such dual-specific antibodies may not exist in the rabbit immunoglobulin repertoire. However, there are indications that such cross-neutralizing antibodies may not be uncommon in human antisera. Uhlig and Dernick (39) isolated four immortalized clones of human B cells producing neutralizing antipoliovirus antibodies. One of the antibodies neutralized both type 1 and 2 polioviruses, and another neutralized all three serotypes, albeit at a lower potency for types 2 and 3. In another study, a mouse monoclonal antibody was shown to neutralize both type 1 and type 2 poliovirus (41) . The epitope for this antibody was mapped at amino acid residues 239 to 245 of VP2, far from the binding site of A12. Therefore, the dualreacting A12 antibody may represent a class of cross-neutralizing antibodies the role of which has been underestimated. Further studies of human antibodies are needed to assess the magnitude of this phenomenon. The method described in this communication is well suited for targeted screening for crossneutralizing antibodies by phage display panning of Fab fragments induced by one serotype against antigens of another serotype.",

            "text": "The existence of cross-neutralizing antibodies goes against the common belief that underlies the classification of polioviruses into three serotypes. This classification is based on neutralization tests performed with hyperimmune animal sera that may not contain cross-neutralizing antibodies. It is very difficult to study this question in humans either epidemiologically or experimentally. Cross-reacting antibodies in monkey sera were revealed in complement fixation testing (23) , and some circumstantial evidence based on the comparison of IPV-induced seroconversion of completely immunologically na\u00efve children and children who have been exposed to heterologous wild polioviruses suggests that there may be some cross-serotypic priming effect (15) . We successfully isolated escape mutants of type 1 and type 2 poliovirus but were unable to isolate type 3 antibody-resistant strains. The reason for this is unknown and may be related to the extremely high potency of type 3 antibodies, the inability to disrupt virus-antibody interactions by one mutation, or low viability of the resulting escape mutants. Some of the epitopes that bind to the MAbs described here map to the antigenic sites previously identified for mouse antibodies, while others may have a different binding mechanism. For instance, the dual type 1-/type 2-specific antibody A12 appears to bind to both antigenic sites 1 and 2 and, thus, fills the canyon on the virion surface where the receptor-binding site is located (3, 9, 42) . Interestingly, one of the antibody-resistant mutations generated in response to A12 treatment (G 1225 D) was previously shown to reduce binding to the cellular receptor by 7-to 14-fold (9) . Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that antibody A12 prevents virus from binding to its cellular receptor. Comparison of the amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures of relevant parts of Sabin 1 and Sabin 2 capsid proteins shows that they are similar, and amino acid differences in this region involve chemically similar amino acids. This provides an explanation of the dual reactivity of the A12 antibody. Another antibody, H2, binds to the space between antigenic sites 2 and 3. Therefore, parts of the virion that are immunologically important in mice and chimpanzees appear to differ. Further studies of native human antibodies to poliovirus are needed to better define antigenic sites.",

The availability of highly potent human-like antibodies to poliovirus opens the possibility of curing chronically infected individuals of their poliovirus infection, thereby stopping shedding of virus into the environment.
