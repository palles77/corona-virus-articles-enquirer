            "text": "Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infectious disease is one of feline infection diseases spreading broadly all over the world. For bedside diagnosis of FeLV infectious disease, an immuno-chromatographic assay was investigated. Five different monoclonal antibodies were developed against the major core protein FeLV-p27. Among them, the combination of FL6 and FL12, which had little epitopic overlap each other, showed the highest sensitivity with no cross-reaction to the other feline virus antigens when they were employed to the immuno-chromatographic assay. The system had a practical detection limit of 0.5 ng of FeLV-p27 per 0.1 ml of feline sera within 15 min. In comparison with clinical standard methods, the system gave rapidly and accurately the same diagnosis with neither false negative nor false positive. Moreover, it did not need any pretreatment of blood specimen.",

            "text": "Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was discovered from cats that lived in a cluster-household where several cats had developed lymphosarcoma (Jarret et al. 1964) . The virus was first isolated from the serum of cat with lymphosarcoma by Kawakami et al. (1967) and was characterized as an exogenous retrovirus, 115 nm in diameter, containing a protein core with single-stranded RNA protected by a lipoprotein envelope. Based on similarities in nucleotide sequences, it has been determined that the evolutionary source of the virus was from an ancestor of the rat (Benveniste et al. 1975) . Although the period of disease development is highly variable, 83% of FeLV infected cats die within 3 years (McClelland et al. 1980) . FeLV is now considered to be the most prevalent cause of severe illness and death in domestic cats. The incidence of FeLV infection in cats in a large urban area was 40%, contrasting with 6% in the surrounding rural area. This indicates that FeLV infection is common and is horizontally transmitted (Rogerson et al. 1975) . Non-infected cats living in close proximity to cats shedding FeLV have a greatly increased risk of infection, and once infected, the cat has an approximately 900 times greater risk of developing lymphosarcoma. It should be possible to break the cycle of horizontal transmission by vaccination or by selectively segregating or eliminating FeLV positive cats from the cat population. For this purpose, simple and rapid diagnosis is important. FeLV has been detected or measured quantitatively by passive hemagglutination test (Sibal et al. 1970) , complement fixation test (Sarma et al. 1971) , mixed hemadsorption test (Maruyama et al. 1971) , immunofluorescent assay (IFA) (Hardy et al. 1973) , focus formation assay using cloned cat cell line C81 (CC81) (Fischinger et al. 1974) , mixed immunoglobulin rosette technique (MIA) , ELISA using polyclonal antibody (Lutz et al. 1980a) , and ELISA using monoclonal antibody (Lutz et al. 1983a (Lutz et al. , 1983b . All of these methods require either multiple-step procedures or a long assay time. Immunochrmatographic assay is a version of immunoassay that can be used for point-of-care examination of patients (Chen et al. 1987; Lou et al. 1993 ) and also at field test of, for instance, pregnancy in cattle (Laitinen and Vuento 1996) . Here, we report on a rapid, one-step, non-instrumented, immunochromatographic assay method that measures FeLV-p27, a component of the shell of the viral core, for feline leukemia diagnosis.",

Bound materials were eluted with the Tris-HCl buffer containing KCl gradient. The concentration of KCl ranged from 0.1 to 1 M. The FeLV-p27 containing fraction was specified by western analysis as previously described (Eto et al. 1991a ). In brief, each fraction was applied to SDS-PAGE and the protein bands on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The band was visualized by using goat polyclonal antibody for FeLV-p27 (Fitzgerald Industries International Inc., Concord, USA). FeLV-p27 was eluted with Tris-HCl buffer including 565 mM KCl, and dialyzed against 100 vol. of PBS.",

All MAbs developed here could detect 1 lg/ml of FeLV-p27 at 250 ng, indicating they have sufficient affinity with FeLV- (2) grass fiber membrane for gold labelled antibody absorption pad; (3) nitrocellulose membrane with immobilized antibodies against FeLV-p27 or mouse IgG; and (4) cellulose membrane for absorbent pad. Some blood containing virus protein is introduced into the strip by the capillary action and the binding between the FeLV-p27 and the labelled anti-FeLV-p27 MAb takes place. This binding complex is transferred by the capillary flow to the nitrocellulose membrane. Then the complex reacts with the immobilized anti-FeLV-p27 MAb for result signal generation. Moreover, the complex reacts with the immobilized anti-mouse IgG antibody for reference signal generation. p27. Figure 3 shows the reactivities of MAbs against various viral particles. These MAbs were able to detect 30 lg/ml of FeLV particles at 750 ng, and shows no cross-reactivity with FIV, FPLV, and FIPV that caused other feline diseases. From the high detectability without crossreaction, it was thought that these MAbs could be used as a diagnostic agent. Sandwich assay for antigen detection needs a set of two MAbs, which recognize different epitopes. In order to choose the set, we applied competitive assay by using at first FL6 as a labelled antibody. Competitors were conveniently divided into three groups from the result shown in Figure 4 . FL30 competitively inhibited the binding of biotinylated FL6 to FeLV-p27, indicating to recognize the same or close epitope, which FL6 recognizes. Because the reaction of the biotinylated antibody was not inhibited with FL18 and FL25, the epitopes recognizable with these MAbs may differ from the one recognized with FL6. It is suggested that the epitope of FL12 is near to the epitope of FL6 since FL12 had the intermediate reactivity in comparison with the former two groups. Thus the FeLV-p27 may be validly measured by using the MAb set of FL6 and FL18, or combination of FL6 and FL25.",

Because FIV, FPLV, and FIPV present clinical manifestations analogous to FeLV infections, clear differentiation is needed (Pedersen et al. 1977; Cotter et al. 1973 ). All the obtained MAbs reacted specifically with FeLV without cross-reactivity against those three viruses which are not immunogen. However, the reactivities of the MAbs to FeLV particles were lower than against FeLV-p27 (Figures 2 and 3) . This is because p27 is a component of the shell of the viral core (Bolognesi et al. 1978) . In general, core protein is not regularly expressed in the intact virion because it is masked by the presence of envelope. However, in the case of FeLV infection, the internal structural proteins are produced in great excess in the cytoplasm of the cell during the replication cycle (Hardy et al. 1969) . Most of internal structural proteins are never packaged into FeLV particles and remain inside the cell or become solubilized in plasma. For this reason, the major core protein p27 is present in particularly high amounts in the blood and is a good marker for the detection of FeLV infection (Lutz et al. 1980b ).",

In fact, these two combinations have sensitivity (5.0 ng/0.1 ml) more than required as described later. However, it is a combination of FL6 and FL12 that the highest sensitivity (0.5 ng/0.1 ml) was obtained. Perhaps, certain parameter except steric hindrance affected this greatly. The antibody that has high affinity is advantageous to catch antigen-antibody complex that consists of conjugated FL6 and FeLV-p27 when there is little steric hindrance. Since FL12 has higher affinity for the antigen than any other antibodies, may have made up for disadvantage about competitive inhibition produced by coexistence with FL6. Moreover, maximum binding of FL12 for the certain amount of antigen is larger than those of FL18 and FL25 (Figure 2 ). It seems that this thing acts profitably to generate strong signal. In this study, the binding affinity between antigen and antibody was measured by ELISA under equilibrium conditions. Because an immuno-chromatographic assay is performed under non-equilibrium condition, rate of binding becomes more important than dissociation constant. The better choice of MAbs will be done by measurements of kinetic rate constant for the binding with the use of surface plasmon resonance biosensor (SPR).",

As shown in the case of the fifth and the sixth cats in the Table 2 , the membrane strip assay enabled us to detect FeLV even in outwardly healthy cat which has only a little virus. Because FeLV-p27 appears before IFA positive in the early period of viremia (Luts et al. 1983b) , it is important to disclose infected cat at such an early stage when infection to others is prevented. In addition, the strip has a practically high specificity; it does not react to the other pathogenic viruses which show similar manifestation with FeLV infection.",

It is well-known that this simplicity and speed are important in contagious sickness prevention. The membrane strip developed in this study has been employed for practical use by veterinarians in Japan.",
