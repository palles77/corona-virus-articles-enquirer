We investigated the rates of four major hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) (pneumonia, symptomatic urinary tract infection, surgical site infection and laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection) in order to identify current distribution and any changes after 15 years. A one-day point prevalence study was performed on 7 September 2005. All inpatients were surveyed for HAIs, community-acquired infections (CAIs), risk factors, pathogenic isolates and antibiotics prescribed. Infections were diagnosed according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. In total, 1021 patients were surveyed; of these, 41 had 42 HAIs (4% prevalence) and 389 (38%) were receiving antibiotics. The commonest HAI was pneumonia (1.4%) followed by bloodstream infection (0.9%) and symptomatic urinary tract infection (0.8%). The prevalence of postoperative surgical site infection was 5.6%. The nosocomial prevalence rate was highest in the Intensive Care Unit, followed by the Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Units, Children's Cancer Centre/Bone Marrow Transplant Unit and Orthopaedics with Traumatology. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the commonest pathogens. The rates are significantly lower than previously and reflect the increased resources for infection control made available following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

            "text": "Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are common causes of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients. Surveillance for nosocomial infections (NIs) is an important component of an effective infection control programme. 1 The National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) system coupled with feedback and interventions successfully reduced the infection rate among participating hospitals. 2 Unfortunately such prospective surveillance is costly and labour intensive. Prevalence surveys are relatively inexpensive and easy to perform, although rates obtained are higher than comparable incidence rates and may be statistically less stable. 3 Despite their limitations they provide a useful estimate of HAI. French et al. conducted serial point prevalence surveys in our hospital 15 years ago. These proved to be a practical and useful way of documenting the trend of HAIs and assessing the impact of an infection control programme. 4 Conducting a prevalence survey also raises awareness among healthcare professionals of infection risks in hospital settings. 5, 6 The objectives of this study were to determine the rate of nosocomial infection and the use of antibiotics. Knowledge of the current situation and major changes in distribution of nosocomial infections should help to prioritize resource allocation, allow a more effective infection control policy and enable a targeted prospective surveillance programme.",

All our investigators were qualified medical and nursing staff with relevant infection control training. Inter-observer bias was minimized by ensuring that the investigators agreed on the interpretation of the diagnostic criterion before the survey. However, Gastmeier et al. showed that despite the use of specific CDC criteria, there could still be subjectivity in the diagnosis of nosocomial infections. 9 The investigator effect was not known in the current survey. Only four major infections were studied. The prevalence of HAI was 4%. In point prevalence surveys using the CDC diagnostic criteria and involving the four major sites of infection (SUTI, LRTI, SSI and BSI) conducted in France, Italy, Norway and Lebanon, the prevalence of HAI ranged from 3.5 to 6.8%. 5,10e13 The inclusion of all sites of infection tends to increase the overall prevalence rate by 20e30% as compared with studies that included only major sites. 6, 14 Thus, if corrected, the HAI prevalence rate estimated for all sites would be 5e6%. This rate was much lower than those found in 1985e1988 in PWH (7.3%), 15 as well as in other countries (6.5e13.95%). 6,14,16e19 Apart from the overall rate, rate reductions were found in HAP (from 1.8 to 1.4%), SSI (from 1.5 to 1.1%), and UTI (from 2.6 to 0.8%) without making case-mix adjustments 15 (Figure 1 ). This probably relates to improved infection control following the SARS crisis in Hong Kong, as evidenced by increased resources and heightened awareness among healthcare workers (HCWs). Our hospital had one infection control nurse per 250 beds after 2003 as compared to the previous ratio of 1:700. Infection control programmes, such as 'alert organism' reporting, biannual hand hygiene audit, regular infection control educational/training to HCWs and SSI surveillance have since been implemented. Heightened infection control awareness was demonstrated by the high compliance rate in hand hygiene audit among HCW. The low prevalence may also relate to a short duration of hospital stay and rapid transferal to convalescence hospitals after initial diagnosis and stabilization.",

The prevalence of nosocomial LCBSI was relatively high, possibly due to a high overall blood culture rate and simple application of the diagnostic criteria. The rate of nosocomial urinary tract infection (UTI) was lower than the 1.5e4.5% reported from other surveys. 5,10e12,16e17 The greatest problem with defining SUTI is that if the urine is not analyzed, UTI cannot be diagnosed. Secondly, the definition did not take into account urinary catheters, as symptoms of UTI other than fever cannot be assessed in catheterized patient. 20 The frequency of SUTI therefore depended upon: (i) Frequency of catheter use: 26% of the patients had an indwelling urinary catheter; (ii) Urine analysis protocol: in our hospital, urine is only analysed when the signs and symptoms indicate a UTI or when a catheterized patient develops a fever. Symptoms of UTI in patients with a serious major disease of other organs may have been ignored; and (iii) Physician's diagnosis: data collection based on doctor's diagnosis may not have been sensitive enough to record all UTIs.",

The prevalence of nosocomial infection was greatest in ICU at 26.7%, which compared with 35.5% 15 years ago, 15 and was similar to that of other studies. 5, 6, 14, 18 The Special Pediatric unit ranked second for nosocomial infection. HAI, not limited to SSI, has been shown to be twice as common in postoperative patients. 6, 11 Thirty-eight percent of patients received at least one antimicrobial agent, more than in other studies (16.6e44%), but only 10% had an infection according to the CDC criteria. 14e18,21 Indications for antibiotic prescription were reviewed retrospectively in order to investigate this discrepancy (Table III) . Prophylactic use (6.3%) and treatment for infections that were not being investigated in the current survey (50%) may have accounted for antibiotic use in 37% of patients. The remaining 35% may have represented treatment of infections not fulfiling the CDC criteria or inappropriate antibiotic prescription. Recent surveys showed that suboptimal antimicrobial prescription is frequent in our hospital. 22 Though appropriateness of antibiotic prescription was not the aim of current study, unnecessary antibiotic combinations were noted (Table III) . Broad-spectrum antibiotics, e.g. imipenem, meropenem and cefepime, accounted for about 20% of the antibiotics being prescribed on the day of survey. Audit of 'big-gun' antibiotics in local university hospitals revealed that 20e25% of the prescriptions were not justified or suboptimal. 22, 23 The upcoming antibiotic stewardship programme targeting this group of drugs should help to optimize use of antimicrobials in the hospital. 23 In summary, provision of better resources appears to have had a definite effect in reducing HAIs. The ICU, Special Pediatric and Surgical/ Orthopaedic units warrant targeted surveillance of nosocomial infection followed by a relevant infection control programme. Another target would be improvement in nosocomial bloodstream infection by promoting proper intravenous catheter care. Repeated prevalence surveys are useful for monitoring trends in rates of both HAI and effectiveness of such intervention strategies. 4 ",
