            "text": "Management of apartment buildings is never straightforward because of the need for collective homeowner action. Mancur Olson suggests that a rational individual will not participate in collective action which provides no positive net benefit for him or her. Based on this premise, it would seem that rationality drives homeowners to free-ride on others' efforts and that, as a result, no collective action will take place. However, some homeowners do actively participate in housing management, and it is worthwhile to examine why some participate and others do not. Building on the wide-ranging applications of the collective interest model (CIM) in explaining political participation and environmental activism, this paper expands its relevance to the arena of housing management. The explanatory analysis which is based on the findings of a structured questionnaire survey in Hong Kong corroborates the central propositions of the CIM and provides a theoretical account of housing management activism. In brief, housing management activism is a function of beliefs about personal and group efficacy, the value of the collective good, and the selective benefits and costs of participation. These findings have farreaching implications for the formulation of government policies promoting homeowners' active involvement in housing management in Hong Kong and other megacities.",

            "text": "What makes the management of multi-owner housing different from that of single-owner housing is the social and economic interdependence of co-owners (Bailey & Robertson, 1997) . Because of this particular feature, the proper management and maintenance of multi-owner housing necessitate collective action on the part of co-owners, which in turn depends very much on the latter's active participation. Since the outcomes of proper building management and maintenance (e.g., better environmental cleanliness, building safety and security) are non-excludible, the free-rider problem is significant in the context of multi-owner housing management, as suggested by Olson (1965) . Olson's supposition helps to explain the prevailing mismanagement or disrepair of residential buildings in megacities such as Hong Kong, Shanghai and Taipei. Although these high-density urban settings feature high-rise developments that allow the efficient use of communal facilities and services like mass transport systems (Lynn, 1999; Vlahov & Galea, 2002) , they also pose higher health and safety risks to local communities due to high population density. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 vividly demonstrated the consequences of the poor upkeep of private housing in high-density urban areas (Hung, Chan, Law, Chan, & Wong, 2006) . The localised widespread transmission of SARS in Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong and the Wenhua community in Taipei created a community health disaster in those cities (Culpan & Lin, 2010; Hung et al., 2006) . Although Olson has a pessimistic view of homeowner participation in building care initiatives, not all buildings appear unmanaged. It is thus interesting to consider why some people choose to participate in housing management and others do not. The phenomenon of homeowner participation in housing management in Hong Kong provides an excellent laboratory for the study of such collective action behaviour. This paper draws on a cross-sectional household survey of homeowner activism in housing management in Hong Kong, and the collective interest model (CIM) is used to explain homeowner behaviour. The CIM posits that people choose to participate in a collective venture when the expected value of their participation exceeds the expected value of their non-participation. This paper is also a response to gaps within the body of academic literature on resident participation in housing management. Although there are many previous studies in this field (e.g., Leung, 2005; Somerville & Steele, 1995; Wood, 2001) , most of them focus on the justifications for or benefits of engaging residents in housing management. Only a few have addressed resident decision-making regarding participation. This paper first reviews the problem of housing mismanagement in Hong Kong from the perspective of collective action. Next is a brief introduction to the CIM, followed by the research methodology. A description of the data and the analysis results follow. The implications of the research findings will be discussed before the conclusion to the paper.",

While there is an extensive public housing programme, over half of the population (52.1%) lived in private permanent housing in Hong Kong at that time (Hong Kong Housing Authority, 2010) . As of 2010, there are around 40,000 private buildings in Hong Kong, and over 17,000 of those buildings are at least 30 years old. Of these, some 4000 are at least 50 years old (Home Affairs . In 10 years' time, that number will increase to 28,000 (Development Bureau, 2010) . The Home Affairs database indicates that over 10,000 private buildings do not have any form of building management i.e., they are not managed by an owners' association or a property management company. It is a general belief that these old unmanaged buildings are most vulnerable to dereliction and dilapidation, jeopardising public health and safety of the community. The contemporary building problem in Hong Kong can be ascribed to the longstanding lack of building care culture in the city (Housing, Planning and Lands Bureau, 2003) . Many homeowners in dilapidated buildings are indifferent to housing management affairs. They are reluctant to carry out safety inspections of their buildings and do not undertake the necessary renovations voluntarily.",

As shown in Table 1 , the number of complaints about building dangers increased at an average annual rate of 10.5% over the thirteen-year period between 1996 and 2009. More importantly, 101 deaths and 435 injuries were caused by building-related incidents from 1990 to 2001 (Task Force on Building Safety and Preventive Maintenance, 2001). In the last 5 years, there was a new wave of building dangers created by falling building components like aluminium windows and concrete pieces (Bowring, 2005; Information Services Department, 2005; Lo, 2005) . Additionally, the proliferation of unauthorised building works (UBWs) also poses safety hazards for building occupants and the general public Lai & Ho, 2001) . Finally, many buildings in the city are at a high risk of fire due to poor fire safety management and inadequate upkeep of fire service installations.",

This event once again triggered public worry over building safety in Hong Kong. Generally speaking, the building-related problems mentioned above were results of the lack of proper building maintenance (Ho, 1993; Wong, Cheung, Yau, Ho, & Chau, 2006) , which is in turn a consequence of building mismanagement. Different attempts have been made to explain the mismanagement of private residential buildings in Hong Kong. However, the co-ownership arrangement that predominates in most of the multi-storey buildings in the area is commonly claimed to be the main underlying reason for the problem (e.g., Walters, 2002; Walters & Kent, 2000; Yip & Forrest, 2002) .",

Owners of dwellings in these buildings do not actually 'own' their units exclusively (Nield, 1990) . Instead, they \"each own an individual share in the whole of the building and the ground on which it is built, which they hold together as tenants in common\" (Nield, 1990: p. 1) . In other words, these individual owners have an exclusive right to use their own units, but at the same time, they are co-owners of the entire building structure, including common areas such as entrance lobbies, access corridors, staircases, lifts, lighting, service ducts and water pumps. Under this ownership arrangement, the responsibility for managing the common areas and shared facilities in a building is thus jointly or collectively shouldered by all the coowners. In this regard, the co-ownership nature of multi-storey buildings has created social and financial connections between coowners (Bailey & Robertson, 1997) . The use, management and upkeep of a building's common areas thus require significant coordination and cooperation among co-owners and, more importantly, their active engagement in building care initiatives.",

If the situation does not change, the homeowners can form an owners' corporation for their building and terminate the PMA's service contract. To form an owners' corporation, support from homeowners of at least 30% of the overall undivided shares is required. For service contract termination, 50% support is required.

Proper building management and maintenance can offer homeowners a broad range of tangible and intangible benefits, but time and financial constraints and a lack of skills and knowledge are commonly identified as limitations on building care actions (Kangwa & Olubodun, 2003) . On this basis, homeowners may ignore building care rationally. As per the rational choice theory (Homans, 1961; Olson, 1965) , an individual can rationally ignore an issue if the cost of educating himself or herself about the issue which is sufficient to make an informed decision exceeds the expected benefits that he or she could obtain from that decision. To put it another way, given that the homeowners perceive that the benefits derived from their participation cannot cover the associated costs, it would be irrational for them to waste time and effort participating in housing management affairs. More importantly, there are homeowners who make some effort or hire a maid to clean the communal corridors in a building; then, other owners can benefit from the improvements in the environment without making a contribution themselves. The favourable outcome of any voluntary building care initiative is a non-exclusive public good. While it is theoretically possible to keep the 'free-riders' from enjoying the favourable outcome, the transaction costs incurred in monitoring and exclusion can be prohibitive. In this way, multi-family housing management exhibits the characteristics of a public good and is vulnerable to the freerider problem. Rational homeowners, from a game-theory perspective, would be better off not to co-operate if they aimed to maximise their own pay-offs (Bengtsson, 2000) . Indeed, individuals in any group will attempt to reap the benefits of others' efforts if the group is working to provide a non-excludable and non-rival good (Brunner, 1998; Buchanan & Tullock, 1962) . In his seminal work, Olson (1965) suggests that non-action or non-participation is a rational choice if the personal benefits derived from taking action are perceived to be less valuable than the personal cost of making the effort. When homeowners must decide unilaterally whether or not to contribute to the provision of a public good, the dilemma of collection action predicts that most owners will behave opportunistically and free-ride on others' contributions (Hovi & Foss, 1995; Lai & Chan, 2004; Walters & Kent, 2000) .",

In this approach, participation is explained in terms of collective interests as a combination of individual demands for the public good and perceptions of individual and group efficacy in the collective provision of the good. Elster (1978) suggests that collective or community action is likely to occur when members of a 'group' are geographically close, have low turnover or membership, share a common interest and believe that they can succeed. Under such conditions, homeowners may feel that participation offers genuine opportunities to influence collective decision-making and make gains. They are more willing to participate, and as a result, collective action is more likely to occur.",

As far as housing management is concerned, the collective good is a housing management outcome that is desirable for all homeowners e the creation of a hygienic, safe and pleasant living environment within the building. The terms in parentheses (V, p i and p g ) are collective interest variables. As indicated by Lubell et al.

Secondly, there exists a wide variety of buildings ranging from old low-rise tenement blocks to high-rise apartment towers. This range of buildings creates a high degree of variation in buildings in terms of age, settings, and management regimes, which is essential to obtaining a diversified sample for analysis.",

Perceived group cohesion, COHE, is also measured using a five-point Likert scale (with 1 \u00bc strongly disagree and 5 \u00bc strongly agree) and indicates the extent to which the individual believes that all co-owners in his or her building share the same values and can co-operate amicably and effectively to provide the collective good. These two variables are especially relevant in housing management. As previously mentioned, homeowner participation is essential for monitoring and maintaining the standard of housing management in a building. Additionally, the assent of the majority of the co-owners in a building is required to kick off projects such as the formation of owners' corporations, the termination of a PMA service contract or the execution of improvement projects. The activism of other homeowners is thus perceived as an important consideration for an individual homeowner considering participating in housing management. At the same time, if the homeowners are not united or do not form a cohesive unit, it is difficult for them to act collectively and work toward the same goal. In such a case, an individual may feel that no collective good will be produced in the absence of consonant views and actions by all (or the majority of) the homeowners. It is hence hypothesised that both EXRE and COHE increase housing management activism.",

These results confirm Yau's (2010) findings that the approach of homeowners to building care in Hong Kong is predominantly reactive.

Perceived outcome influence, INFL, is found to be nearly as important as discontent level.

Both variables gauging the collective efficacy of the 'homeowners groups' have an influence on individual homeowner decisions regarding housing management activism. These results confirm Weible's (2008) proposition that a group's collective efficacy shapes individual members' expectations, which in turn determines their participation (and non-participation). Selective cost measures how the typical demographic variables considered in other studies fit into the CIM for housing management activism. Although gender has no significant effect on housing participation level, better-educated and older homeowners engage more actively in housing management affairs. Interestingly, the estimated coefficient of HINC is negative, but it is not significant even at the 10% level. That means that income shows no effect on housing management activism.

However, the empirical findings of this study suggest that although self-perceived personal influence affects the likelihood of housing management activism, homeowners will participate only if they are dissatisfied with housing management outcomes. These findings reflect the reactive nature of these homeowners to housing problems: as long as they can tolerate existing housing management outcomes, they continue letting others do the work for them.

Given that the selective costs of participation are relatively fixed, we can boost the expected value of housing management activism by increasing either the selective benefits of participation or the collective interests. In the first approach, institutional arrangements or economic incentives can play a role. Currently, if the majority of homeowners at an owners' meeting come to a consensus (e.g., a decision to upgrade the elevator system), the minority may not participate. The owners' corporation can only bring the case to court to bring the uncooperative owners in line. Since this method is often too costly and time-consuming, it is not used very often. The resolution in question will then be discarded or simply put on hold. This frequently occurs and is a major reason why plans for improving building conditions or management are suspended. Legislation can be developed to punish uncooperative owners or those who do not participate even if the majority of homeowners in a building collectively agreed. This tactic increases the costs of free-riding, which indirectly increases the selective benefits for those who participate in housing management.",

However, it is sometimes difficult for the average homeowner to visualise the association between housing management performance and property value because with the exception of physical conditions, the various performance aspects of housing management (e.g., financial management and dispute resolution) are not easily observable by outsiders. Therefore, assessment schemes for benchmarking the overall performance of housing management should be devised and implemented for all apartment buildings in Hong Kong. This step would make additional information available to the market and create a 'league of value' in the form of higher-scored properties that should command a higher rent or value. With a view toward the potential economic benefits, homeowners may perceive greater value in housing management and may be more likely to participate actively in housing management. Another approach would be to enhance collective interests by reinforcing social bonding among homeowners. If a strong sense of community and cohesion exists among neighbours within a building, homeowners may hold very similar values regarding housing management. As a result, each of them will expect a greater degree of reciprocity from the other and a close working relationship will be there to keep their building a pleasant place to live. The government and owners' associations can help amplify the collective or group efficacy in achieving the collective good by fostering long-term partnerships among homeowners. More supports or subsidies should be offered by the government and owners' associations to organise social gatherings and activities which can bring homeowners together. Mechanisms like mediation should also be put in place to resolve disputes or conflicts between homeowners in an amicable and non-destructive manner. Otherwise, a long-term relationship cannot be ensured.",

On the other hand, it may potentially create health and safety risks for the community because there is a strong link between the built environment and people's state of health. Another drawback of high-density living environments is the predominance of high-rise multi-family buildings, the management of which can be particularly difficult. Co-ownership arrangements in these buildings create a need for collective action among homeowners in order to achieve effective housing management. Nevertheless, because its outcome is a public good, housing management is always subject to the freeriding problem. In investigating the dilemma of collective action among homeowners, this article uses the CIM to investigate the benefit-cost expectations associated with participation in the management of apartment buildings in Hong Kong. Based on the analysis results, key elements of the CIM e the perceived value of housing management outcomes, personal efficacy, group efficacy, selective costs and selective benefits e were found to be directly and positively related to the level of housing management activism.",

The findings of this study can have a positive impact on housing management policy-making in Hong Kong and can also offer insight into the sustainable management of the housing stock in other megacities. Additionally, this study should stimulate more research on the dilemma of collective action for homeowners. It may be very interesting to further explore whether homeowner activism is sensitive to the existence of owners' associations and the involvement of PMAs. It would also be worth studying how government policies or schemes adjust the decision calculus of homeowners. Moreover, given the rise of urban activism (e.g., in fights for public open spaces or heritage conservation) in many Asian cities in recent years, the applications of the CIM might include future analyses of the behaviour associated with community participation.",
