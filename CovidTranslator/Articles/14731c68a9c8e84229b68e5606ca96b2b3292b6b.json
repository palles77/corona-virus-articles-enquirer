However, many neighbourhoods around the world are distressed by neighbourhood nuisances or unacceptable behaviour of the residents. While interventionist approaches and incentives have been adopted in many countries to curb these problems, a punitive measure is used in Hong Kong instead. The Housing Department launched the Marking Scheme for Tenancy Enforcement in Public Housing Estates immediately after the SARS epidemic. The scheme operates as a penalty-point system where sitting tenants will be expelled from public housing if they receive sixteen points for the misdeeds they have committed. Yet, the marking scheme itself was put onto the stage without any prior public consultation. Besides, it has been criticised for its unfair and tenure-biased enforcement. Also, whether the scheme is widely accepted is highly doubtful. Against this background, this study aims to explore the tenants' views regarding residents' unacceptable behaviour and the marking scheme in Hong Kong's public housing. The findings of this research offer valuable insights into the perceived extent and causes of the neighbourhood problems. Moreover, this research lets the public administrators know the acceptability of the marking scheme among public housing tenants.",

Yet, it is not guaranteed even if housing is flawlessly designed and constructed because the quality of living environment. In fact, apart from housing design and construction, residents' well-being is contingent also on housing management (Yau, 2010) . While non-participation or inactivity of residents has been regarded as one of the major causes of poorly-managed housing, the impacts of neighbourhood nuisances or residents' unacceptable behaviour started gaining growing attention from policy makers, housing authorities, residents and academics in the western countries in recent years (e.g. Adderley, 2008; Burney, 2005) . Frequently reported nuisances or unacceptable behaviour include deliberate littering in communal areas, using dwellings for illegal dealings, creating disturbing noise, spraying graffiti and other vandalistic acts. The seriousness of these problems has been vividly demonstrated by the increasing number of complaints and residents' dissatisfaction with their neighbourhoods (e.g. Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland, 2008; Scottish Government Social Research, 2007) . These nuisances do not only lower the level of housing satisfaction (Pacione, 1982) , but also adversely affect the health and well-being of the residents (Agyemang et al., 2007; Curtis, Dooley, & Phipps, 2004; Jacobson, Millie, & Hough, 2008) . The neighbourhood nuisances aforementioned are, in general, socially unacceptable behaviour for their adverse impacts on other residents and the stability of society. The problems should thus be addressed.",

            "text": "In Hong Kong, neighbourhood problems did not attract much social concern before 2003, and they were dealt with in a rather fragmented manner. For example, noise nuisances were regulated by the Noise Control Ordinance whereas deliberate littering and spitting were controlled by the Fixed Penalty (Public Cleanliness Offences) Ordinance. An integrated policy to crack these problems was absent. Nonetheless, a structured control was institutionalised in 2003. As the aftermath of the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in early 2003, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong Government) implemented the Marking Scheme for Tenancy Enforcement in Public Housing Estates in August 2003, with a stated aim to improve the hygienic and living conditions in public housing estates in the territory (Team Clean, 2003) . The scheme operated as a penalty-point system where sitting tenants would receive penalty points for committing the prescribed misdeeds, and would be expelled from their public housing units if their penalty points accumulated up to a certain level. Yet, the marking scheme was put onto the stage without any prior comprehensive public consultation so its legitimacy has been subject to challenges. To justify the institutionalisation of the scheme, it is necessary to understand the public housing residents' experience of neighbourhood problems, and evaluate their levels of acceptance to the scheme. Against this background, this study attempts to find out the extent and causes of neighbourhood problems in public housing perceived by the residents, who are intolerant of these problems and who support the implementation of the marking scheme in their estates through a structured questionnaire survey.",

In particular, ABS is the terminology most commonly used by policy makers and academicians. The Chartered Institute of Housing (1995) defined ASB as wrong-doings conducted in opposition to the society's norms and accepted standards of behaviour. ASB was defined by the Local Government Information Unit (1997) as \"behaviour that causes harassment to a community; amounts to anti-social criminal conduct, or is otherwise anti-social; disrupts the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of a neighbourhood by others; intimidates a community or section of it\" (p. 5).",

On one hand, ASB can pose adverse impacts on the quality of the living environment. On the other hand, housing plays a significant role in the governance of ASB (Flint, 2002 (Flint, , 2006 .

Around 25% and 10% of the households there complained against vandalism (including graffiti and damage to property) and illegal drugs, respectively, in their neighbourhoods (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2006) . According to the findings from the American Housing Survey in 2009, around 25.4 million and 9.8 million occupied housing units suffered from the characteristic neighbourhood problems of noise and litter, respectively (United States Census Bureau, 2010) . In England and Wales, one of the major statutory weapons against neighbourhood nuisances is the Anti-social Behaviour Order (ASBO) issued by the court. This measure was introduced under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which defines ASB as \"acting in a manner that caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or no more persons not of the same household as the defendant\" (Berman, 2009, p. 3 In addition to littering, throwing of objects from height (TOH) is one of the commonly seen neighbourhood problems in housing in Hong Kong. 1410 and 1422 cases were reported in the 1996e1998 and 1998e2000 periods, respectively (The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, 1999 Government, , 2001 . 62 TOH cases happened in public housing estates in the period between 1996 and 1998, with another 45 cases between 1998 and 2000. This problem was then growing serious. During the period between 2007 and 2009, the Hong Kong Government received 335 reports of objects being dropped from height in public housing estates (The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, 2009). The ASB or neighbourhood problems in Hong Kong seem to proliferate quickly, which arouses concern among public administrators and the community.",

In Millie's (2009) opinion, social forces like the decline in moral standards and family values bring about the predicament.

Perhaps, the first principle to contain the problems is to make the residents to be selfmotivated to act in a conforming manner by means of internal social controls. In most situations, however, internal social controls do not work, and various formal and informal social sanctions (i.e., external social controls) are thus necessary for ensuring behavioural conformance by the residents. In general, these external controls can be classified into three main heads, namely contractual, legal and social approaches. Examples of contractual approaches include the uses of introductory tenancies and acceptable behaviour contracts (Crawford, 2003) . In the former method, for instance, the concept of probationary period in employment contract is applied. Instead of a secure or permanent tenancy, what local housing authorities offer to the new tenants is an introductory tenancy with a term of nine or twelve months in the first place. If a tenant behaves properly in the introductory or probationary period, a secure tenancy will be offered. Otherwise, the tenant will not be offered any secure tenancy or the introductory tenancy will be terminated by the social landlord before the end of the term. The application of introductory tenancies has its merits because it allows social landlords to evict 'trouble tenants' without the need for obtaining statutory possession orders from the courts. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that the tenants will keep on behaving properly after the probationary period. On the other hand, legal approaches rely on punitive legislation, and involve the issuances of statutory parenting, injunction and ASB orders by courts at different levels (Flint & Nixon, 2006; Millie, 2009) .",

Other interventionist means adopted in the United Kingdom include the Family Intervention Projects (FIPs) which aim to stop the ASB of families and restore safety to their homes and to the wider community. Upon referrals by statutory agencies, housing associations or voluntary sector organisations or even self-referrals, families with ASB problems have to live in FIP core accommodations and fulfil a set or rules set by the local authorities (Respect Task Force, 2006) . The rules include visitors by permission only, restricted access in and out of the FIP building, and mandatory presence of the children and adults in the accommodation at a set time in the evening. The families will be sanctioned if the rules are broken. Apart from the restrictive measures, motivating approach has been adopted in Australia where tenants who meet the conditions of their tenancy agreements can enjoy rent concessions and accelerated home repairs under the Tenant Incentive Schemes (Jacobs, 2008) .",

In this regard, the Hong Kong Government set up the Team Clean which was an inter-departmental taskforce in May 2003.

The rationale behind the scheme was that the unacceptable behaviour, or misdeeds as coined by the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA), 1 of the residents played a large part in the poor or unhygienic living environment in public housing. In this light, apart from promoting personal and environmental hygiene in public housing estates and building up a sustained healthy living environment, the marking scheme also aims to \"assist tenants in rectifying bad habits that jeopardise personal and public hygiene\" (Audit Commission, 2005, p. 13). The marking scheme was, by its nature, the first structured control to tackle the neighbourhood or ASB problems in Hong Kong's public housing estates (Yau, 2008) . To signify the wider use of the scheme for more effective management of public housing estates, the HD renamed it as the Marking Scheme for Estate Management Enforcement in Public Housing Estates on 18 October 2006 (Hong Kong Housing Authority, 2010).",

For twelve prescribed misdeeds, prior warnings are given before point allotment with the purpose of encouraging timely rectification by perpetrators.

To strengthen the deterrent effect of the marking scheme, upon the tenancy termination under the marking scheme, the HKHA will bar the evicted households from applying for public rental housing via the general waiting list for two years, counting from the day after the date of tenancy termination. This is a form of the access conditionality on evicted tenants. To avoid the tenants taking advantage of the marking scheme to move to a better-quality flat (e.g. one with better geographical locality, young age or higher floor level), the HD will not offer a flat of better quality to those households with tenancies terminated under the scheme upon rehousing (Hong Kong Housing Authority, 2010). In other words, access of public housing tenants who carry valid penalty points to other public housing premises is also constrained. In case the extenants evicted from public housing become genuinely homeless, they may be offered interim housing flats in the New Territories. Table 2 summarises the numbers of warning and point allotment cases from 1 August 2003 to 30 November 2009. In that period, 11,204 households received penalty points and there were 12,003 point-allotted cases in total. At the period's end, around 4700 households still remained in the penalty-point system. Over the years, 550 households have accrued ten or more points. Of the 24 households receiving sixteen points or more, two have moved out of their premises voluntarily. For the other 22 cases, the HD issued a total of 19 NTQs (Transport and Housing Bureau, 2009). As indicated by Table 3 , littering has been the most frequently committed misdeed. Second to this is 'smoking or carrying a lighted cigarette in estate common area'. On the other hand, while over 1000 warning letters were issued for 'utilising laundry pole-holders for drying floor mop' and 'obstructing corridors or stairs with sundry items rendering cleansing difficult', point allotments for these cases were unlikely.",

Although the HKHA ascribed pushily the improvement to the operation of the marking scheme, the scheme itself is not free from censure. Yau (2008) condemned the scheme for its tenurebiased selective control as it regulates only public housing tenants, and not residents in other tenure modes, in Hong Kong. More importantly, the marking scheme was put onto the stage without inclusive public consultation. As postulated by Yau (2011), the real intention of the marking scheme is not to curb the unacceptable behaviour of public housing tenants. Instead, the scheme is likely to be a tool for strengthening the HKHA's sovereignty over public housing resources in Hong Kong. In this regard, it is worthwhile to study how the residents perceive the neighbourhood problems in public housing. Also, it is interesting to know what the causes of these problems are, who cannot tolerate the problems and who support the implementation of the marking scheme in their housing estates. These findings can help the community to justify whether the marking scheme should be institutionalised or not.",

The TPS was announced by the Hong Kong Government in December 1997. Under the scheme, sitting tenants of selected PRH estates were allowed to purchase their own flats at a discount from estimated market price. The scheme was implemented in phases, starting in 1998, and suspended in 2002. 39 public housing estates have so far been covered by the TPS. In these estates, the residents can be public housing tenants, owneroccupiers or private tenants. Since written consents from the owner's corporations of the TPS estates are required for the implementation of the marking scheme, the scheme is not put in force in all the TPS estates. As at the end of 2010, the marking scheme was applicable to 15 TPS estates only. Furthermore, the number of enforceable prescribed misdeeds in TPS estates is 15 only, as indicated in Table 2 . Misdeeds occurring in the estates' communal areas such as smoking, littering and spitting are not sanctioned in the TPS estates. What the marking scheme caters in TPS estates are 'in-flat' misdeeds. With these enforcement differences, residents in these two types of housing estates may hold different opinions to the marking scheme. Table 5 presents the socio-demographic profile of the respondents. On average, the respondents had been living in public housing for 20.0 years, as at the time of interview. Since public housing tenants are means-tested, most respondents belonged to the low-income class. Not less than 57% of the respondents had monthly household income less than HK$17,250, the median monthly domestic household income of the whole population in Hong Kong in 2006 (Census and Statistics Department, 2007) . Over 60% of the respondents were below 45 years old. Those with tertiary education attainment (including diploma and higher certificate) or above accounted for less than one-third of the sample only.

As shown in Table 6 , over 60% of the respondents opined that 'litter and rubbish' was serious problem in their estates. The seriousness of 'illegal gambling in public spaces' and 'objects thrown from height' was also affirmed by about half of the respondents. Among the twelve problems under research, only the mean scores of 'dripping water', 'burglary' and 'illegal hawking' are not significantly different from three, at least at the 10% level. Illegal hawking is the only problem with a mean score lower than three although the difference is not statistically significant. The respondents did not regard illegal hawking as a serious neighbourhood problem in their estates perhaps because of the stepped-up enforcement against illegal hawkers by the HD in the 1990s. The HD's Mobile Operation Units were given the statutory powers to arrest illegal hawkers and seize their goods in public housing estates. ",

This finding echoes with those by Millie et al. (2005) and Ipsos MORI (2006) in which poor parenting was also found to be the most imperative cause of ASB in the United Kingdom. As for poor discipline at school, the perceived relevance with Hong Kong's public housing seems being higher than the cases in the United Kingdom. These findings may be a reflection that parents from the low-income families need to work long hours so they do not have time and resources to take care of their children. Besides, the schools may not have equipped the students with good discipline. In light of these findings, the Hong Kong Government should offer more community services to support the working parents in child custody and youth development. Besides, not only should the schools discipline the students strictly, but also should the schools promote a sense of civic awareness among students.",

Failure in effectively policing against residents' unacceptable behaviour was perceived as a main cause by the third most respondents. Therefore, the respondents believed that the proliferation of neighbourhood problems in public housing was the fault of the HKHA and property management companies. Furthermore, some prescribed misdeeds such as 'obstructing corridors or stairs with sundry items rendering cleansing difficult' and 'drying clothes in public areas' can be stamped out through better housing design or better spatial use of communal areas by the HKHA (Yau, 2011) . To facilitate clothes drying of the households, for example, building-integrated drying facilities (e.g. balconies or utility platforms) can be provided and spacious communal areas on the roof or podium level of the housing blocks can be designated. In light of the inadequate provision, the HKHA was considered liable for the neighbourhood problems in public housing.",

In the structured questionnaire survey, each respondent was asked whether he or she agreed that the neighbourhood problems in his or her housing estate were very serious and intolerable. The respondent had to express his or her answer with a five-point Likert scale (with 5 \u00bc strongly agree and 1 \u00bc strongly disagree). A higher score indicates a higher level of intolerance of the respondent to the neighbourhood problems or unacceptable behaviour in his place of living. The level of support of the respondent (SUP) for the marking scheme is measured using a fivepoint scale (with 5 \u00bc strongly support and 1 \u00bc strongly oppose).

Put it another way, new immigrants from mainland China and respondents from other ethnic groups did not support the marking scheme. It is possibly because these groups of people are marginal residents in the local public housing sector. In the absence of any explicit policy or regulation governing ethnic integration in neighbourhoods, these people are not well-received by the local community. Given the predominance of locally born and trained Chinese in public housing, these marginal residents can be picked on by their neighbours and edged out from their public housing units easily under the marking scheme.

The household-based enforcement of the scheme can offer a good explanation for this finding. Under the scheme, household is taken as the counting unit. The whole household has to receive the sanction even if only one of its members has committed a prescribed misdeed. It is reasonable for one to predict, if other things are constant, the chance for being sanctioned will be higher for households with more members due to the larger number of potential perpetrators. Therefore, subject to a higher chance of tenancy termination, respondents with more cohabiting family members tended were not in favour of the marking scheme. In point of fact, this kind of household-based enforcement is essentially punishment by association, or collateral punishment. It induces no-fault eviction of innocent tenants simply because of the misconducts of their household members. In addition, this penalty system can doubly victimise the innocent household members. Supposedly, the punishment by association attempts to mobilise the household members' efforts to help the perpetrators to prevent the latter's misbehaviour, and to rectify the latter's bad habits. Nonetheless, it also creates injustice to the innocent parties. Even worse, family harmony can be blemished by the marking scheme.",

            "text": "Neighbourhood nuisances and ASB problems in housing have long been creating many troubles to local residents and governments globally. In western countries, foci are put on social or public housing when these problems are addressed. The rationale behind is rather straightforward: public housing is generally regarded as the marginalised housing sector because of the prevalence of the residual welfare model (Forrest & Murie, 1988; Malpass, 1990) . Therefore, people living in public housing are regarded less competent in taking care of themselves, and thus more problematic. While public renting in Hong Kong is still not a heavily residualized sector, formal control against residents' unacceptable behaviour started in this sector. Since 2003, the HD implemented the marking scheme in all PRH estates and some TPS estates with a stated aim to improve the environmental hygiene in public housing. However, whether the institutionalisation of the marking scheme is justified by the seriousness of the neighbourhood problems and residents' acceptability has remain unanswered. This article contributes to the body of knowledge by exploring the views of 339 control subjects (i.e., public housing tenants) in Hong Kong towards the neighbourhood problems in their estates and the marking scheme. As indicated by the survey findings of this study, the marking scheme does not receive wide support from the public housing tenants. More importantly, it has been conceived unfair and abusive by certain groups of residents. In this regard, the HKHA may need to conduct a comprehensive review of the marking scheme, in which public housing tenants should be involved.",

Over the period between 1 April 1999 and 31 December 2007, 14,972 ASBOs have been served. A similar situation has happened in Scotland where the number of applications for the issuance of ASBO increased by over 900%, from 26 in 1999/2000 to 283 in 2005/2006 (Scottish Government Social Research, 2007).
