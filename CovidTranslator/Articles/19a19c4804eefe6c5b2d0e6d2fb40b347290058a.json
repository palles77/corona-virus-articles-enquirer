Each circle represents all the peptides bound by each allotype (HLA-B*15:01 -red, HLA-C*01:02 -blue and HLA-B*46:01 -orange).

(E) Shown is a space filling model of HLA class I seen from above the top face and looking at the bound peptide. For each of the six peptide binding pockets (A, B, C, D, E and F) there is an alignment of the residues in HLA-B*46:01, HLA-B*15:01 and HLA-C*01:02 that are key positions within the pocket.

For label-free relative quantitation of ligands, LC-MS spectra were collected in data-independent (DIA) mode. The3363 msec DIA cycles consisted of one survey MS1 scan followed by 34 MS2 fragment scans with 25 m/z transmission windows overlapping by 1 m/z, covering a mass range of 300-1150 m/z. DIA data was interpreted by Skyline 3.5.0.9319. First, an annotated fragment spectrum library was exported into an mzXML by PEAKS 7.0 from the large-scale de novo identification experiments. For HLA-B*15:01, HLA-B*46:01 and HLA-C*01:02 the library consisted of 8868, 3313 and 1073 peptides, respectively. The library was imported into Skyline for analysis. For each peptide in the library at least 8 ions were monitored including the precursor, precursor+1, precursor+2, and the top 5 most intense fragment ions (transitions). Only peptide matches in any given sample with library dot-product scores of > 0.7 were considered a true hit. For all of the hits, the intensity for each peptide was determined using a summed area underneath the curve for all transition ion extracted ion chromatograms. Intensity data for each peptide were normalized to the combined intensity of four HLA-A*02:01 restricted West-Nile virus derived standard reference peptides (RLDDDGNFQL, ATWAENIQV, YTMDGEYRL, and SLFGQRIEV). These reference peptides were added to the denatured complexes to give a concentration of 400nM for each peptide. Sequence encoding the D1 and D2 domains (amino acids 1-200) of KIR2DL3*001 and a Cterminal BirA ligase site (amino acid sequence: GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pet30A (EMD Biosciences), immediately downstream of sequence encoding a 6-His purification tag.

Cell lysis was augmented by ultrasonication for 20 mins and cell lysate was collected by centrifugation (30,000 rpm for 25 min). The cell lysate was washed a further 3 times in 60ml chilled lysis buffer, each time discarding the supernatant.
