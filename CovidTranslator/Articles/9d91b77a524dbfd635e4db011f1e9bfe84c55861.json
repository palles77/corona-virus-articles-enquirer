Large peplomers or spike glycoproteins (S) are the viral attachment proteins that protrude from the virion and give it the appearance of a corona. Coronaviruses are members of the Nidovirales, which produce 3\u2032 co-terminal nested subgenomic mRNAs upon entry into susceptible host cells. The genome is the largest of all RNA viruses (27.6-31.2 kb), and the genomic RNA is infectious when transfected into cells from a wide variety of species and tissue types. Yet most strains of coronavirus have very restricted species and tissue tropism, illustrating the major role S-receptor interactions play in the species specificity and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. SARS-CoV sequence analysis shows that it has many of the unique characteristics of coronaviruses and that it shares the most predicted amino acid similarity and other molecular signatures with serogroup 2 coronaviruses (6) .",

Upon entry into host cells the coronavirus gRNA (27-31.5 kb) serves as an mRNA to translate two large polyproteins (1a and 1ab). The polyproteins are autocatalytically processed into replicative enzymes, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which synthesizes both negative-sense and positive-sense sgRNAs, and the positive-sense sgRNAs serve as mRNAs for all of the open reading frames (ORFs) downstream of ORF1b (6, 11) . SARS-CoV infects Vero, Vero E6, and primary rhesus monkey kidney cells in culture, and infected cells have a nested set of eight 3\u2032 co-terminal of mRNAs, each of which has at its 5\u2032 end a leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032 terminus of the genome (6, 12) . We took advantage of the unique features of CoV replication, sgRNA transcription in particular, to develop multiplex primers to differentiate input gRNA from sgRNA that is produced upon entry into the host cell. A 180-bp amplicon is produced from a sense primer (SARS-1 [5\u2032-ATATTAGGTTTTTACCTACCCAGG-3\u2032]) that is specific for the leader sequence and an antisense primer specific for the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein gene (SARS-21,593R [5\u2032-AGTATGTTGAGTGTAATTAG-GAG-3\u2032]). This amplicon is produced only when sgRNA is present and indicates virus entry and replication. To identify gRNA (input and newly synthesized), a sense primer that binds the 3\u2032 terminus of the 1b gene (SARS-21,263 [5\u2032-TGCTAACTACATTTTCTGGAGG-3\u2032] was paired with SARS-21,593R to produce a 276-bp amplicon. The amplification was performed as a multiplex reaction for SARS-CoV gRNA, sgRNA, and G3PDH by using a OneStep RT-PCR procedure (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA); thus, both positive-and negative-sense SARS-CoV RNAs served as templates for reverse transcription.",

In contrast, sgRNA was not detected in nonpermissive murine (L2) or human (MRC5) cell lines, and gRNA fell below detectable limits by 5 d. The reaction conditions were optimized to favor amplification of SARS-CoV gRNA and sgRNA; thus, when they were present at high levels, amplification of G3PDH was reduced.

Subtle clinical disease was observed in some of the mice; four mice had ruffled fur for >3 days, including mouse 12, which had qualitatively high levels of gRNA and sgRNA in its lung ( Figure 1B ). No respiratory distress or diarrhea was observed throughout the study. The virusinoculated mice tended to gain less weight than the mockinoculated mice (Figure 2A ). In addition, 3 of 15 mice lost 5%-6% body weight 3 days p.i., and 1 of 9 mice lost 6% body weight on day 7. Overall, six mice exhibited either mild clinical signs or weight loss throughout the study, while mock-inoculated mice remained unaffected. This finding suggests that SARS-CoV caused a subclinical infection or a very mild disease in mice. Serum antibody to SARS-CoV was analyzed by a virus neutralization assay ( Figure 2B ). Mock-inoculated mice showed no virus neutralization, nor was neutralizing antibody detected in mice euthanized 3 or 5 days p.i. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all mice sacrificed 7, 10, and 28 days p.i., and the titers were 8-to 16fold higher on day 28. These neutralizing titers are similar to those reported for naturally and experimentally infected animals (5, 8) . In addition, seroconversion to SARS-CoV is the accepted standard for the determination of human infections by SARS-CoV and continues to be more reliable than RT-PCR methods (4) .",

Furthermore, the high neutralizing antibody titers on day 28 p.i. are supportive of an active viral infection. The presence of SARS-CoV RNAs or neutralizing antibodies demonstrates that all 15 inoculated mice were infected. The results of this study suggest that SARS-CoV peaks early (days [3] [4] [5] , and the immune response clears the virus from the lung and intestine by 10 days, which suggsts that viral clearance in mice is more rapid than in human patients, who begin to recover 7-12 days after the onset of clinical illness (approximately 9-14 days after infection) (3, 4) . In 10% to 15% of patients, the initial phase of disease is followed by more severe pulmonary disease characterized by respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells, multinucleated syncytia, and fibrosis (3, 4) . The pathophysiology of the late complications of SARS is not understood, but immunopathology could play a critical role in the disease. This study opens many potential avenues of research using wild-type, transgenic, or knockout mice to answer questions of how age, sex, prior exposure, and immune response influence the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.

A) Vero E6, murine fibroblast (L2), and human lung fibroblasts (MRC5) were inoculated with SARS-CoV at an MOI of \u22480.001 or were mock-inoculated (M). G3PDH, SARS-CoV gRNA, and sgRNA were amplified by multiplex RT-PCR from total RNA extracted at 1 h, 16 h, or 5 days after inoculation. Amplicons were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis; negative images are shown. B) Mice were inoculated with 2x10 5 50% tissue culture infective dose of SARS-CoV (lanes labeled 6-17) or were mock-inoculated (M) and euthanized after 3, 5, 7, or 10 days. G3PDH, SARS-CoV gRNA, and sgRNA were amplified by multiplex RT-PCR from total RNA extracted from the lung (L) and intestine (I) harvested at various time points. Heminested PCR (HN) was used to amplify gRNA and sgRNA from RT-PCR reactions. Positive and negative controls for PCR reactions are indicated by + and -, respectively. D indicates DNA marker ladder. *The doublet observed in HN-PCR reactions results from residual primers used in the primary amplification reaction.",
