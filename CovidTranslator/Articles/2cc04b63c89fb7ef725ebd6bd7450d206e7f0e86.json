To understand the mechanism of recombination in murine coronavirus, we have performed RNA sequencing of viral genomic RNA to determine the precise sites of recombination in a series of recombinants which have crossovers within the gene encoding the peplomer protein. We found that all of the recombination sites are clustered within a region of 278 nucleotides in the 5'-half of the gene. This region in which all of the crossovers occurred represents a small fraction of the distance between the two selection markers used for the isolation of these recombinant viruses. This result suggests that this region may be a preferred site for RNA recombination.",

            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the prototypic member of the Coronaviridae, is an enveloped virus which contains nonsegmented positive-sensed RNA of 32 kb in length (Lai and Stohlman, 1978; Pachuck et al., 1989; Baker et a/., 1989) . The virus particle is composed of three envelope proteins (S, M, and HE) and a nucleocapsid protein (N). The S protein (Spike protein, formerly named E2) forms the surface projections or peplomers, which are the outermost components of the virus surface. This protein is responsible for the attachment of virus to target cells and the induction of cell-to-cell fusion and is the target for neutralizing antibodies (Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . Alterations in the S protein have been shown to result in changes in viral pathogenicity, as demonstrated by virus variants selected by escape from neutralization with monoclonal antibodies (Fleming et a/., 1986; Dalziel et a/., 1986) . The peplomer is composed of two 90-kDa glycoprotein heterodimers, which are the cleavage products of a 180-kDa glycoprotein. The cleavage of the S protein is carried out by cellular proteases and is required for virus infectivity (Storz eta/., 1981; Yoshikura and Tajima, 1981; Sturman et a/., 1985) . This protein most likely interacts with the receptors on the target cells. The functions of the other two envelope proteins are less well understood. The HE protein (formerly named E3 or gp65) contains an esterase activity but is present only in certain strains of MHV (Lai and Stohlman, 1981; Siddell, 1982; Makino et al., 1983; Makino and Lai, 1989; Shieh et a/., 1989) . The M protein (formerly named El) is mostly embedded within the viral envelope (Armstrong eta/., 1984; Rottier eta/., 1984 Rottier eta/., , 1986 ; however, monoclonal antibodies against M protein can also alter the pathogenicity of the virus (Fleming eta/., 1989) .",

Only the 5'-terminus of each mRNA, representing the unique portion which does not overlap with the next smaller mRNA, is utilized for translation (Leibowitz et al., 1982; Siddell, 1983) . The S protein is translated from mRNA 3, representing a genetic region roughly 8.5 to 4.5 kb from the 3'-end of the genome. The complete sequence of this gene (gene 3, previously named gene C) has been reported for two different strains, A59 and JHM, of MHV (Schmidt et a/., 1987; Luytjes et a/., 1987) . The two sequences are 93% homologous but differ in a major aspect in that A59 contains 156 nucleotides of additional sequence at the 5'-terminal onethird of the gene. The significance of these extra sequences in A59 is not known. resistance to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies, or ability to induce cell-to-cell fusion as selection markers. Most interestingly, the recombinants obtained have crossovers not only in the genetic region between the two selection markers but very often also in other regions without selection pressure (Makino er a/., 1987; Keck et al., 198813) indicating an extremely high frequency of recombination. Although RNA recombination has also been observed in picornavirus (King et a/., 1982) and more rarely in brome mosaic virus (Bujarski and Kaesberg, 1986) , the frequency of RNA recombination in coronavirus is exceptionally high. This finding suggests that coronaviruses have a unique mechanism of RNA replication, leading to a high frequency of RNA recombination.",

These recombinants were obtained using temperature sensitivity in viral replication and viral sensitivity to neutralizing monoclonal antibodies as selection markers (Makino et al., 1987) . Previous oligonucleotide fingerprinting studies have indicated that all of these recombinants have a crossover site within the S gene of the virus. These recombinants have been used to map various biological determinants associated with the S protein (Makino eta/., 1987) . RNA sequencing studies presented in this report reveal that all of the recombination sites are localized within a small region of the S gene. Furthermore, these sites are adjacent to an area which is subject to frequent deletions in several different MHV strains and some monoclonal antibody escape variants (Parker et al., 1989) .

In Fig. 1 A, the sequences of the two parental strains along with the published sequence of MHV-JHM (Schmidt eta/., 1987) are compared for the region corresponding to nucleotides 1 100 and 2 100 from the 5'-end of the S gene, which encodes the peplomer protein. These 1000 nucleotides cover the genetic region which encompasses all of the recombination sites of the recombinants examined in this study (see below) and also represent the most diverged region in the S gene between the published A59 and JHM sequences (Luytjes eta/., 1987) . It has previously been shown that the S genes of A59 and JHM are 93% homologous in overall sequence, with the amino terminal half (Sl) showing less homology than the carboxyl terminal half (S2) (Luytjes et a/., 1987) . The sequence shown in Fig.  1A is contained within the Sl region. Surprisingly, the sequence of JHM-DL used in our laboratory differs from the published JHM sequence, even though both were derived from the same source. These two strains share 98% homology (excluding the deleted sequence), while JHM-DL and A59 are 85% homologous. Most interestingly, both A59 and published JHM strains have large areas which are missing from the corresponding region of JHM-DL. The A59 strain is missing 156 nucleotides starting at position 1501, while the deletion in JHM encompasses 423 nucleotides beginning at position 1359. These deletions result in an S protein which is 52 amino acids smaller for A59 and 141 amino acids smaller for the published JHM strain. These results are presented diagrammatically in Fig. 1 B. The deletions in both A59 and JHM occurred in the same region. No additional deletions in other areas of the S gene for either A59 or JHM were detected (data not shown).",

Because the two parental strains contain many nucleotide differences which are scattered throughout the S gene, the recombination sites could be determined by comparing specific nucleotide differences between the two strains. An example is shown in Fig. 2 , in which a portion of the Sl gene of recombinant EL5 is compared with those of the two parental strains. EL5 contains A59-specific sequences 3'to nucleotide 1308 of the S gene. The next base difference between A59 and JHM-DL, in the 5' direction, occurs at nucleotide 1293; at this position, EL5 is identical to JHM-DL, as are the remaining nucleotides on the 5' side. Thus, recombinant EL5 has a crossover site between nucleotides 1293 and 1308. Since JHM-DL and A59 are completely homologous within this region, the crossover site can only be localized to these 15 nucleotides. A comparison of RNA sequences of some of the recombinants with the parental strains is shown in Fig. 3A . Among all of the recombinants examined, EL3 has a crossover site closest to the 5'-end of the S gene, switching from JHM-DL sequences at nucleotide 1148 to A59-specific sequences beginning at nucleotide 1162. EL2 has a crossover site slightly closer to the 3'-end, switching from JHM-DL to A59 between nucleotides 1231 and 1236. The remaining seven recombinants have recombination sites between nucleotides 1291 and 1426, as shown in Fig. 3B Nucleotides are numbered according to Luytjes et a/. (1987) .

            "text": "Coronavirus undergoes a very high frequency of RNA recombination (Makino eta/., 1986) . The data pre- sented in this report precisely determined the sites of recombination for a series of recombinant viruses with crossovers within the gene encoding the peplomer (S) protein. The crossover sites of the nine recombinants from two different crosses are clustered in the amino half of the protein. All of the recombination events occurred in a stretch of 278 nucleotides within the S gene, which is greater than 4 kb in total length. Seven of the recombination sites are within 135 nucleotides of each other; among these, three are located at the same site. This finding that the recombination sites are clustered within a short stretch of the S gene is of considerable interest. These recombinants were selected by using two selection markers (Makino et a/., 1987) : resistance to monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific for JHM-DL (Fleming et al., 1986) and temperature sensitivity in virus replication. The MAbs used (J2.2 and J7.2) have been shown to react with the S protein (Fleming et al., 1986) . The ts mutants used were t&47 and tsLA12, both of which have an RNA (+) phenotype (data not shown). Preliminary sequence analysis of another set of recombinants between A59 and MHV-2, which were generated using the same ts mutants (Keck et a/., 1988b) , suggests that the ts lesions of these mutants are located upstream of the S gene, probably within the gene encoding the HE protein (Shieh et al., 1989 ) (data not shown). Thus, the potential sites of recombination between the two selection markers is greater than 1.5 kb. The fact that nine separate recombination events occurred in a small area within the potential recombination sites of more than 1.5 kb suggests that this area may be highly susceptible to recombination. It should be noted that several of these recombinants have been shown by oligonucleotide fingerprinting to have more than one crossover in the genome (Makino et a/., 1987) . These additional sites were not selected by selection pressure and were scattered throughout the 32-kb genome. Thus, there may be other recombinational hot spots as well. It has previously been shown that poliovirus RNA recombination also follows a pattern of nonrandom distribution, suggesting the presence of preferred crossover sites (Tolskaya et al., 1987) .",

We have previously used this series of recombinants to localize sites of neutralizing epitopes and neuropathogenic determinants of JHM strain to the carboxyl terminus of the peplomers (Makino et al., 1987) . Now that the crossover sites of these recombinants have been mapped within the N-terminal half (Sl region), the possible localization of both the neutralizing epitopes and neuropathogenic determinants has to be expanded to include not only the carboxyl terminal half (S2) but also the C-terminus of the Sl protein as well.",

This area, encompassing more than 400 nucleotides, is subject to frequent deletions of varying sizes. The deletions within this region occurred not only during in vitro passages in tissue culture (such as JHM-X, 1 a, 2c, and possibly A59), but also during in vivo passages (probably the JHM strain sequenced by Schmidt et al. (1987) ). We have recently found that a JHM strain isolated after passages in rat spinal cord, Atllf (Morris et al., 1989) , also has a similar deletion of 441 nucleotides in the same region (La Monica et al., in preparation) . Furthermore, Parker et al. (1989) have recently found that many of their monoclonal antibody escape variants have a large deletion within the same area of the S gene. Thus, we conclude that this is a hypervariable region which is highly susceptible to deletions. It should be noted that the end points of these deletions are not at the same nucleotides. Also, JHM-X-l a and -2c have two deletions within the same general area. Thus, the deletions are probably not a sequence-specific event.",

It is possible that this hypervariable region has a very complex structure which may interrupt RNA synthesis. As a result, the \"pausing\" RNA intermediates may dissociate from the template. In the case of recombination, the dissociated RNA intermediates and RNA polymerase rebind to an RNA template derived from a different virus; the continuing RNA synthesis will result in a recombinant virus. For a deletion to occur, the RNA intermediates rebind to the original or homologous template but at a downstream location. Further RNA synthesis on these intermediates will lead to deletions. We have previously provided evidence for the generation of such RNA intermediates during MHV RNA synthesis (Baric et a/., , 1987 . Indeed, the computer analysis of the 1000 nucleotides surrounding the area of recombinations and deletions suggests the possible presence of extensive and stable secondary structures (data not shown). Additional experiments are needed to determine whether this is indeed the mechanism of coronavirus RNA recombination.",
