During an immune response, B cells specific for the inciting antigen(s) are activated and differentiate into \"plasmablasts\", which are released into the blood. In this study we sequence the plasmablast antibody repertoire to define the targets of the active immune response in RA.",

ACPAs target proteins that have undergone citrullination 124 , a posttranslational modification that converts peptidyl-arginine to peptidyl-citrulline. Presently, such antibodies are detected in the clinic using the cyclic-citrullinated-peptide (CCP) assay 15 . The CCP assay uses as detector antigens a mixture of cyclized, citrulline-substituted peptides derived from filaggrin, a protein not expressed in joint tissue 4 , and therefore does not identify the bona fide, in vivo targets of ACPAs. Thus, uncovering the specificity of the ACPAs that contribute to the pathogenesis of RA remains a critical challenge 14 . To gain further insights into the specificity of the autoantibody response in RA, we developed and applied a DNA barcoding method to sequence the cognate heavy-and light-chain pairs of antibodies expressed by individual peripheral blood plasmablasts derived from individuals with anti-CCP autoantibody positive RA (anti-CCP + RA).",

Several methods exist for the profiling and isolation of native human antibodies, including single B cell RT-PCR [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, single B cell RT-PCR is laborious, requiring Sanger sequencing of each B cell, followed by production and screening of a large number of antibodies [7] [8] [9] [10] . Two recently developed methods have begun to address the issue of heavy-and light-chain pairing on a larger scale. One method involves the deposition of single B cells in highdensity microwell plates followed by the sequencing of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of their antibody genes 13 . The other involves mass spectrometric analysis of circulating antibodies against specific antigens followed by combinatorial expression and screening of possible heavy-and light-chain pairs 14 . Although useful tools, these methods have shortcomings: they use V-gene-specific primers that fail to amplify all immunoglobulin sequences (especially mutated 5'-end sequences that have arisen from extensive somatic hypermutation that may confer interesting biological properties); they cannot distinguish between sequencing errors and closely related sequences that have arisen through somatic hypermutation; they sequence only the CDR3 regions and thus cannot accurately identify clonal families of antibodies that share other heavy-and light-chain variable region sequences; they cannot accurately determine the size of clonal antibody families; and they require PCR cloning and Sanger sequencing to deliver complete V-region sequences.",

Recombinant antibodies RA1, RA2 and RA3 bound weakly, whereas RA8 bound relatively strongly.

            "text": "Schematic of a DNA barcode-enabled method for high-throughput sequencing and recombinant production of endogenous antibodies (A to C) Overview of the method. (A) Plasmablasts are single-cell sorted into 96-well plates, and cDNA is generated by reverse transcription, during which a unique well-ID barcode is added to all the cDNA in an individual well. (B) All the barcoded cDNA from one plate is pooled and tagged with a unique plate-ID. (C) cDNAs, which are now double-barcoded with well-IDs and plate-IDs, are pooled and sequenced using next-generation 454 sequencing. (D to E) Specifics for barcoding and library preparation. (D) During reverse transcription, an adaptor containing a unique well-ID barcode is incorporated at the 3' end of the first-strand cDNA by using the 3'-tailing activity of a thermally stable RNaseH \u2212 reverse transcriptase. (E) Plate-IDs and 454 Titanium Primer A are added during PCR amplification by using a barcoded adaptor. A further round of nested PCR is performed, adding 3' plate-IDs and 454Titanium primer B. (F) For cloning and expression of an antibody, either PCR or gene synthesis is used. For PCR, a 5' primer specific to a particular well-ID is used to amplify only the desired pair of heavy-and light-chain cDNA from the pooled cDNA of the appropriate plate. Standard molecular biology is used to insert the antibody V(D)J or VJ sequences in-frame into an expression vector containing the appropriate antibody ACPA production by RA plasmablasts (A) Fluorescence-activated gating strategy for single-cell sorting IgG-secreting plasmablasts from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of individuals with RA. Plasmablasts were first gated on live, single PBMCs and then gated on surface staining for IgG + plasmablasts, as shown. SSC, side scatter (B) Antigen array screening of the binding to citrullinated peptides of antibodies produced by bulk cultured plasmablasts from patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), with anti-CCP + , or with anti-CCP \u2212 RA. Antibody-binding values were normalized as described in the methods; blue represents no reactivity, yellow moderate reactivity, andTan et al.",
