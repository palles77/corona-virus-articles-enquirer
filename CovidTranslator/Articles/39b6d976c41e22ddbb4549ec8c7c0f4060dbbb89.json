Therefore, the procedures were assumed to be aerosol generating, and previously described precautions to prevent contact and airborne infection were undertaken to prevent nosocomial SARS infection [3] . Although the CDC provided guidelines for the prevention and control of SARS infection on 6 May 2003 [4] , those guidelines have, to the best of our knowledge, never been tested for the procedure described here.

However, PPE should be used that covers all exposed areas of skin including the arms, torso, eyes, nose and mouth. N95 or higher standard respirators are also necessary. A fit-check should be performed each time a respirator is put on. For better protection of staff working inside operating theatres, we used HEPA units with hoods completely covering the head and neck and portions of the shoulders and torso. Factors to consider when choosing respirators in this setting include availability, impact on mobility, comfort, duration of use and recharge power supply. With the units we used, the HCWs did not encounter any major difficulty, apart from slightly reduced mobility and difficulty in communicating while carrying out the operation. Some problems known to be associated with HEPA units include partially charged batteries, ineffective filters, and contamination of HCWs during disrobing. Proper training prior to use may reduce such problems.",
