The relative importance of different respiratory pathogens and relevant microbiological data in Asian children are unclear. This study elucidated the epidemiology of respiratory infections in Hong Kong children with asthma exacerbation. Methods: A total of 209 children aged 3-18 years with asthma exacerbations and 77 controls with stable asthma were recruited. The severity of asthma exacerbations was assessed according to Global Initiative for Asthma guideline, and subjects aged 6 years or older performed exhaled nitric oxide and spirometric measurements. Nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect 20 different respiratory pathogens. Results: Respiratory pathogens were detected in 105 (51.0%) subjects. The presence of any respiratory pathogen was associated with asthma exacerbation (odds ratio [OR], 2.77; 95% CI, 1.51-5.11; P , .001). Specifi cally, human rhinovirus (HRV) infection was more common among children with asthma exacerbation (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.09-5.32; P 5 .018). All other pathogens or coinfections were not associated with asthmatic attacks. None of these respiratory infections was associated with the severity of asthma exacerbation ( P . .15 for all). During peak HRV season in the winter of 2007 to 2008, this virus was detected in 46.4% of children with asthma exacerbations. Conclusions: Respiratory viral infections are commonly found in children with asthma exacerbation, with HRV being the most important pathogen in our patients. Respiratory viral infection is a triggering factor for asthma exacerbation but does not correlate with its severity.",

Our primary outcome was the difference in detection rate for any respiratory pathogen between children with asthma with acute exacerbation and controls (ie, stable asthma). Secondary outcomes consisted of differences in the clinical severity of asthma exacerbation, lung function parameters, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide concentration (FeNO) in relation to patients with different respiratory pathogens.

Deep nasal swabs were obtained as an alternative in situation where an isolation facility was unavailable. 19 These specimens were put immediately in viral transport medium and kept at 4\u00b0C during transportation. Both viral RNA and DNA were extracted on the same day of collection by PureLink Viral RNA/ DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). RNA extracted was converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase (Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase; Invitrogen). All DNA and cDNA were used immediately for nested multiplex PCR for 20 respiratory pathogens as described previously. 20 Tables 1a and 1b in the online supplement summarize sequences and amplicon sizes of the outer and inner sets of PCR primers. Briefl y, each nested multiplex PCR assay detected four pathogens. Group 1 comprised infl uenza A and B group-specifi c and subtypes H1N1, H3N2, H5N1specifi c primers; group 2 comprised parainfl uenza viruses (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4a, and PIV-4b); group 3 comprised RSV A and B, HRV, and enterovirus; group 4 comprised HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, and HMPV; and group 5 comprised M pneumoniae , C pneumoniae , HBoV, and adenovirus. Both the fi rst and second rounds of PCR were conducted in 20-m l reaction mixtures using fast thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA). Two microliters of cDNA was used as the template for the fi rst round of PCR for groups 1 to 4, whereas 8 m L of the extracted preparation was used for group 5. In the second round of PCR, a 0.2-m L aliquot of the fi rst-round PCR product was used as a template. Table 1c in the online supplement summarizes the PCR conditions of fi ve multiplex nested PCR assays. The PCR products were stained by SYBR Safe (Invitrogen) and visualized by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels.

Infected respiratory epithelial cells, and possibly macrophages, produce a variety of proinfl ammatory cytokines, chemokines, and leukotrienes. These mediators in turn attract different infl ammatory cells to the airway, resulting in worsened immunopathology and increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness observed in patients with asthma. In addition, airway epithelium from patients with asthma is defi cient in mounting adequate antiviral responses to HRV. 31, 32 HBoV was detected in 5.0% of 1,906 local children hospitalized for acute RTIs, 33 and seasonal distribution was noted from September to February. Despite this, the detection of HBoV in 2.4% of cases and 2.6% of controls was not associated with asthma exacerbation in the present study. This fi nding might be explained by our exclusion of infants and young children, who were at increased risk of HBoV infection. 9, 33 Three-fi fths of adults with asthma exacerbation had M pneumoniae and/or C pneumoniae , 34 and telithromycin was shown to be a useful treatment in these patients. M pneumoniae was detected in more than half of patients with asthma, 11 and also in upper airway secretions from 11% of patients with chronic stable asthma. 14 Hahn 12 claimed oral macrolides to be effi cacious for patients with acute asthma. On the other hand, Cunningham et al 10 failed to show any relation between M pneumoniae and childhood asthma exacerbation. M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae were detected only in 2.4% of our children with asthma exacerbations, which was similar to that observed in patients with stable asthma. Our fi ndings do not support atypical bacteria to be important pathogens for asthma exacerbations in children or the usefulness of macrolides in treating these patients.",

The number of controls was much lower than that of our recruited cases, mainly because casecontrol matching within 1 week was not possible on many occasions when stable and especially younger patients also complained of nonspecifi c upper respiratory symptoms (eg, rhinorrhea, blocked nose, sore throat) during change of weather. Our sample size had a power of 97% for detecting any difference in the detection of any virus between cases and controls, published data about the importance of HRV in white populations. In the Childhood Origins of Asthma birth cohort, a total of 259 children were followed prospectively from birth to 6 years of age. 24 HRV-associated wheezing in years 1 and 3 were the strongest predictor for asthma diagnosis at the age of 6 years. Nearly 90% of children who wheezed with HRV in year 3 subsequently developed asthma. Two other studies found HRV to be the most important microbiological risk factors for asthma diagnosis and disease exacerbation. [25] [26] [27] More recently, Miller et al 28 reported that childhood asthma exacerbations were associated with the novel group C of HRV rather than the two previously known phylogenetic groups A and Results expressed in mean (SD) and only included data for pathogens that were detected in fi ve or more patients. a P , .05 for between-group comparisons. b P , .005 for between-group comparisons. c P , .01 for between-group comparisons.

Thus, larger studies are needed to delineate the possible association between asthma exacerbation and RTIs by these organisms. The lack of standardization on the methodology of HRV detection would also pose a problem. A recent study revealed that HRVs consist of . 100 distinct serotypes. 35 In view of this degree of phylogenetic heterogeneity, the PCR primers designed for our multiplex assays were not able to detect all HRVs. Despite the use of sensitive multiplex assays as discussed previously, our molecular approach for detecting viruses would miss some HRVs that were not covered by our PCR primers. Future studies need to adopt multiple PCR primers that specifi cally target as many HRV serotypes as possible. Another weakness is that NPA samples were collected from 236 (83.4%) subjects, whereas nasal swabs were collected from the remaining subjects. As we previously reported, the overall sensitivity of detecting infl uenza, parainfl uenza, RSV, and adenovirus in NPA was higher than that obtained by nasal swabs in local children. 36 On the other hand, we did not have relevant data for HRV. Although more than 80% of subjects had NPA samples, it is possible that we might have missed some organisms in those with only nasal swabs. We also observed that only 30% of patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation had successfully performed FeNO measurement according to guideline (Table 1) . 18 As patients with severe bronchospasm were probably too breathless for the procedure, only patients with milder attacks would contribute to FeNO readings in this group. In addition, a substantial proportion of these patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids prior to FeNO. These reasons explain the lower FeNO in these patients when compared with patients with stable asthma.",
