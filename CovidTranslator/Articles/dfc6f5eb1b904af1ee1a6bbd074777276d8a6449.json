This information is urgently needed for the planning and effective implementation of preventive and control measures to combat dissemination of the virus within and outside of the Middle Eastern region. Despite the strong link between the transmission patterns of the disease and both zoonotic transfers and human-to-human transmission [12] , data on the risk and contributing factors to the rapid spread and health effects of the virus are lacking, particularly in hospitalized patients from the KSA [8] . Significant questions remain unanswered on the extent of the Saudi people's awareness of the characteristics and nature of this virus. Finding answers to these questions is instrumental for the implementation of effective preventive measures to reduce and control the frequent occurrence of MERS-CoV outbreaks. Increased public awareness of the disease may decrease the risk of the virus and help combat the disease in the annual mass-gathering events that occur in the KSA, such as the Hajj and Umrah. This study aimed to identify the gap in knowledge of the adult population residing in Riyadh, KSA, toward the nature and transmission modes of MERS-CoV infection.",

A two-stage sampling method was employed. The first stage consisted of selecting 5 top malls located in different zones of Riyadh city (north, south, middle, east, and west). Then, a simple random sample of adults shopping in these malls who were willing to participate in the study was interviewed using a self-administered questionnaire. To measure the level of knowledge in both males and females, a 1:1 ratio was purposefully chosen. The enrollment strategy was undertaken to cover all three different work shifts of the malls (morning, afternoon, and night).

No significant differences were found in the sources of information between respondents with a good or poor level of knowledge on MERS-CoV in this cohort of participants (Table 2) . Table 3 shows the frequencies of correct responses to each question in the epidemiological and clinical domains. Almost all of the participants had heard of the coronavirus disease and were able to relate its cause to a viral origin (100% and 99%, respectively). The participants also highly recognized the mode of transmission of the disease as via the respiratory tract through coughing (99.0%) and from person to person (94.4%). However, they were less likely to associate the transmission of infection with talking with an infected person or to shaking hands with an infected person (52.4% and 49.3%, respectively). Frequencies of correct answers to questions related to whether the virus could be transmitted from an animal to a person, whether the camel was a reservoir of the causative agent, whether the agent could cause repeated infections and whether they knew of any vaccine against the agent were 86.4%, 84.8%, 66.3%, and 75.1%, respectively. Knowledge about signs and symptoms, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, pharyngitis and diarrhea, was high (97%). Questions such as \"Could MERS-CoV lead to direct death\" also showed a high rate of positive answers (89.5%). However, the participants' knowledge about other questions related to the incubation period of the disease, the recovery of patients and infection without signs and symptoms was poor (59.2%, 25.0%, and 24.1%, respectively).",

Approximately 66% of the study participants had overall good knowledge regarding MERS-CoV (66.4%). This frequency is comparable to the reported knowledge score from a study conducted in Al Qaseem (73.2%) but higher than the knowledge score reported in a study conducted in Makah (32.4%) [15, 16] . However, these two studies enrolled only healthcare workers and had different sample sizes and respondent characteristics. More nurses were included in the study from Makah than in the study from Qaseem. Our study went further to explore the gap in knowledge among the general population regarding the characteristics of the disease and to determine related factors. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively assess the necessary and required epidemiological and clinical knowledge aspects of the disease. The study highlights gaps in knowledge and the essential elements required to educate and encourage the Saudi public to play active roles in the prevention and treatment of the disease and possibly reverse the course of this rapidly growing, highly infectious and fatal disease. Additionally, our study adopted a unique approach of separately evaluating the epidemiological and clinical knowledge domains, which typically are combined together in similar studies. Combined assessment of these two domains might overstate the overall knowledge score and obscure the identification of areas with a significant lack of knowledge. Reliance mostly on the clinical manifestations of these types of diseases to assess public knowledge might produce biased results. Our approach allowed us to glean information concerning these areas and identify inadequate epidemiological knowledge and skills that need urgent educational interventions. This approach could be useful for similar studies evaluating public knowledge toward infectious diseases other than Mers-Cov, such SARS, H1N1, Zika, and Ebola.",
