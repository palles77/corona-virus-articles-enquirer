For instance, previous studies that were conducted in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom showed that participants recruited via the Internet had higher prevalence of risk behaviors such as unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) and multiple partnerships, as compared with those recruited from other gay venues [18, 19] . Other studies showed that participants recruited from some venues, such as gay saunas, had higher prevalence of HIV/sexually transmitted disease (STD), as compared with participants recruited from other sources [20, 21] . A cohort study reported that \"sourcing male sex partners mostly from saunas\" is a significant predictor of HIV seroconversion, with a relative risk of 2.35 [3] .",

            "text": "Gay saunas operate quite openly in China-information and addresses are available in most of the Chinese gay websites and are known to the majority of MSM. Some countries, excluding China, have established policies governing gay saunas or have house rules within saunas to reduce the chance of having high-risk behaviors occurring on-site [22] . Prevention efforts targeting gay saunas in China are at the preliminary stage. In some individual cities in China, limited but sporadic outreach work in gay saunas has been provided by some peer MSM health educators. Nevertheless, there are studies showing that condom availability is a factor associated with UAI taking place in gay saunas [12, 23, 24] . Previous studies also showed that the high risk of HIV transmission exist while cruising in parks [25, 26] . Very few studies have systematically compared HIV/STD prevalence among MSM according to key venue type for sourcing sex partners [4, 27] , although there are a number of studies reporting variations in HIV/STD prevalence according to where the survey took place [20, 21, 28] . There are in fact two different types of studies regarding gay venues-those investigating variations by site of partner sourcing and those investigating variations by site of data collection. Regarding the latter, a respondent recruited from a bar, for instance, may also go to saunas or other gay venues so that the interpretation is less specific than it sounds. It is important to find out whether having gay sauna and/or other gay venues as the main sites for sourcing sex partners is going to catalyze HIV/ STD transmissions in China. The results have important policy and programming implications.",

Eligibility criteria included those who selfreported having had oral or anal sex with men in the last 12 months, aged 18 years or over when the survey was conducted. With verbal informed consent, anonymous face-to-face questionnaire interviews were administered by peer MSM workers in some private rooms. After pretest counseling, a 5 mL blood specimen was taken from the participants for HIV and syphilis testing. Following a face-to-face interview, participants were informed about the results of the HIV rapid testing, and posttest counseling was provided to them thereafter. Those showing an HIV-positive rapid test result were asked to return to the CDC in person after 2 weeks to receive the confirmatory result by the method of Western Blot test. Those with confirmed HIV-positive status received additional posttest counseling and were referred to receive HIV-related services. Participants were informed about the syphilis testing result within 2 weeks by phone. Those who tested positive for syphilis were referred to receive relevant treatments and services.

For instance, when saunas were compared to bars as venue types for partner sourcing, only city 01 gave a significant OR, while the result obtained from the meta-analysis was statistically significant. Methodologically speaking, it is a reminder that statistically negative results obtained from HIV and STD prevalence surveys targeting MSM in China should be interpreted with extreme caution, as the usual sample size of 200-500 [5, 27] might not have an adequate power for detecting significant differences.

Animals were removed from wet markets to control severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian flu [37] , and schools were closed to control human swine flu [38] . This is, however, not the case regarding gay saunas in China, which have been shown to have a potentially important role in HIV/STD transmissions. It is arguable whether gay saunas in China should be shut down. Such a measure would damage the relationship between HIV workers and stakeholders such as gatekeepers and MSM clients. HIV workers may argue that closure of saunas would make MSM even \"harder-to-reach,\" as they approach MSM for HIV prevention mainly through venues such as gay saunas. A nation-wide open debate may be necessary to facilitate policy making.",

Applying Bonferroni adjustment to the data would mean that we should reject the null hypothesis of no difference only when the P value is lower than about 0.0083. The significant results from the comparisons of HIV prevalence between the cases of saunas vs. bars and saunas vs. Internet remained significant, although the comparisons of syphilis prevalence would not meet this stringent adjustment. Another important limitation of the study was related to the way of asking the question about venues of sourcing male sex partners. Participants were requested to give a single answer of the most frequently used venue for sourcing male sex partners. For some participants, there might be two equally frequently used venues. Multiple venues could have been used but the role of the other venues could not be analyzed as such infor-mation was not available in the surveys of this meta-analysis. Furthermore, the 10 cities did not cover the whole of China although efforts have been made to cover different parts of China. We need to pay attention to the representativeness of the 10 cities when interpreting the results. Gay saunas exist in almost all 61 cities and are important venues for sourcing male sex partners among MSM all over China. Even the 61 cities could not truly represent the entire China, especially the smaller cities and towns. The 10 cities covered a large population (over 8% of the national population). The results are hence important but they may overrepresent the larger cities in China.",
