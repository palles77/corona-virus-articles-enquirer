[7] , we were able to rescue measles virus antigens from the jejunum of 7 of 11 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in a clinically stable state by the cell fusion technique using polyethylene glycol [ 3 ] . It was hypothesized that the manifestation of measles virus in iejunum cells at certain times, probably at exacerbation, by an unknown mechanism results in the infection of nascent T-lymphocytes [9] and the modification of T-cell membranes. Then the modified T-lymphocytes can be recognized as foreign bodies and anti-modified T-lymphocyte sera will be produced as T. Ebina et al. auto-antibodies. These auto-antibodies, frequently found in the sera from MS patients in the exacerbation state, were proved to be detectable as lymphocytotoxic antibodies (10/12 patients, 83%) [10] . As the cell membrane of T-lymphocytes shares common antigens with human brain tissue [1, 2, 12] , it is likely that the virus-induced lymphocytotoxic antibodies would further cross-react with brain cell membranes, leading to the immunopathological demyelination in the central nervous system of MS patients. We propose briefly that MS is an auto-immune desease triggered by a virus infection. The purpose of this paper is to confirm our hypothesis and to develop a new treatment for MS. Therefore, in order to inhibit the growth of measles virus in the patient's jejunum at exacerbation, we obtained an lgA-rich colostrum containing anti-measles neutralizing antibodies, which are resistant to proteases, and orally administered it to patients with MS.",

For a clinical assessment, disability scores adopted by the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies (IFMSS) and listed as the Minimal Record of Disability were used. The Minimal Record of Disability containes data with which comparisons can be made between one MS centre and another or between one country and another. The Multiple Sclerosis Minimal Record of Disability consists of five sections: demographic information, functional systems, the disability status scale in MS, incapacity status and environmental status. For this report, the data for functional systems and the disability status scale were used. In evaluating functional systems, ratings are based on the results of standard neurological examinations (pyramidal, eerebellar, brain-stem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual and mental functions). For the disability status scale, scoring is based on the functional systems rating on a 10-point scale.",

Also Table 2 shows the contents of IgA and lgG in colostral non-fat milk. It is clear that 1st day colostrum contains the greatest amount of laetoglobulins with the highest NT titre when compared with 2nd and 3rd day colostrums. Market milk contains few lactoglobulins and no neutralizing antibodies to measles virus. Therefore, we studied the effect of the 1st day colostrum on altering the course of MS. Next, in order to characterize an effective lg component having anti-measles neutralizing antibodies in colostrum, IgG and IgA were purified as described in Materials and methods. As shown in Table 3 , the neutralizing activity of IgG and IgA against measles virus (Edmonston strain) was 1:1.5/rag and l:10.7/mg respectively. Therefore, it seems that the neutralizing activity of IgG in colostrum is quantitatively dependent ( Table 2) and that IgA is important qualitatively for inhibiting measles virus growth in the jejunum.",

[5] reported that intrathecal interferon reduced exacerbations of MS, but serial lumber injections of interferon are painful. Mertin et al. [6] reported on the marginally beneficial effect of immunosuppressives (azathiopurine, antilymphocyte globulin and prednisolone), which were especially effective for HLA-A3-positive patients. However, immunosuppressive treatments also cause various side-effects. On the other hand, our oral colostrum administration did not cause any side-effects. Present data show that colostral non-fat milk containing lactoglobulin with NT titre to measles virus seems to hinder the clinical course of MS. Recently, Watanabe et al. [11 ] reported that infecting rats with murine coronavirus JHM led to the development of demyelinating encyphalomyelitis several weeks to months post infection. Lymphocytes from these diseased Lewis rats were restimulated with basic myelin protein and adoptive transfer of these cells led to lesions resembling those of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in recipients. This model demonstrates that a virus infection in CNS tissue is capable of initiating an auto-immune response, which may be of pathogenic importance. We would like to propose that MS is also an auto-immune disease triggered by a morbillivirus infection in the small intestine.",
