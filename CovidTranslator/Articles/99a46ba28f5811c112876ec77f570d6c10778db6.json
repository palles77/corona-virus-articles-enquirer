As of February 23, 2020, 78,811 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,462 deaths have been reported globally and the vast majority of the cases and deaths has happened in China [5] . With a series of measures such as knockdown of 13 cities in Hubei province and stringent travel restrictions throughout the nation, the disease spread is slowing down. However, China still reports quite a few new cases and new deaths every day and the epidemic may rebound as people return to workplace after extended Spring Festival holiday. Meanwhile, the number of infected patients is increasing in other countries (especially in South Korea, Japan, and Italy) [5] .",

Since then, Chinese physicians are alert to SARS and similar diseases [14] . If the manifestations and chest images indicate viral pneumonia and similar cases occurs in a region during a short time, they naturally think of SARS that is called Feidian in Chinese language. When suspected cases admitted to hospitals, involved physicians may mention Feidian and communicate in WeChat using this word. As showed in the current study, the activity of Feidian in WeChat began to rise on Dec 15, 2019. According to publications of early cases with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection, five to eleven patients had symptom onset by this day, with the first onset on Dec 1, 2019 [1, 11] . Furthermore, the activity of Feidian persisted at levels higher than those ahead of Dec 15, 2019 and it dramatically rose to a peak on the day of the outbreak announcement.

Data by now shows that the symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. Whether there was an inner link between the word activity in WeChat and early patients is unknown. The activity of novel coronavirus in WeChat was abnormally high on Dec 11, 2019 with an Index value of 400. However, its baseline value of WeChat Index (value equals 0 or 50) was very low compared with those of other keywords (Appendix A). It is unclear whether the abnormality was a signal or a noise. As for keywords related to symptoms such as shortness of breath, dyspnea, and diarrhea, WeChat Index increased in value ahead of 9-13 days of the outbreak announcement. These symptoms are not specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection. The increases may have some association with emergence of the disease, or just a coincidence. Though lack inner link and not performed that well in detecting the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak compared with keyword Feidian, other keywords explored in the study, including those not considered as potential candidates for the outbreak sign, and even keywords not explored in the study (such as the names of drugs treating SARS-CoV-2 infection), may still have value in future outbreak detection and monitoring. Experience from Google Flu Trends showed that a combination of potential keywords other than a single keyword is more successful [9] .",

As far as we know, GPHIN and other established tools do not gather data from WeChat, the dominant Chinese social media. The current study shows that gathering and analyzing data from WeChat may be amazing to early detect disease outbreak. This may have an advantage especially for detecting outbreaks in China considering the population of WeChat users. Previous studies used search query data, including Baidu Index, to monitor the activity of emerging infectious diseases [15] [16] [17] . As far as we know, this is the first time to use WeChat data in this field. As the current study indicated, using WeChat data may perform better than using Baidu search query data in early detecting the outbreak of a new disease because people may communicate first in WeChat in the times of WeChat as a lifestyle of Chinese",
