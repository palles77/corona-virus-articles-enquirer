The results demonstrate that upon binding to membraneanchored ligand, DC-SIGNR undergoes a conformational change similar to that previously observed for DC-SIGN. The results also validate a model for the extracellular domain of DC-SIGNR derived from crystallographic studies. Force measurements were performed with DC-SIGNR variants that differ in the length of the neck that result from genetic polymorphisms, which encode different numbers of the 23-amino acid repeat sequences that constitute the neck. The findings are consistent with an elongated, relatively rigid structure of the neck repeat observed in crystals. In addition, differences in the lengths of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR extracellular domains with equivalent numbers of neck repeats support a model in which the different dispositions of the carbohydrate-recognition domains in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR result from variations in the sequences of the necks.",

            "text": "T he human glycan-binding receptors DC-SIGN (dendriticcell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 1-grabbing nonintegrin; CD209) and DC-SIGNR (DC-SIGN-related receptor, also designated as L-SIGN, CD209L, and CD299) share overall sequence identity of 77% and arose by a relatively recent gene duplication within the primate lineage. DC-SIGN is expressed on dendritic cells and some macrophages, while DC-SIGNR is expressed on endothelial cells in the liver and lymph node sinusoids and in cells lining placental capillaries. 1\u00c03 Expression of these receptors on distinct cell types suggests that they have potentially different functions. Both bind to the T-cell surface receptor ICAM-3 1,2 in order to facilitate infection of T cells by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 4 ) and act as primary receptors that mediate entry of Ebola virus into cells. 4, 5 However, they bind differentially to other pathogens. 6 For example, DC-SIGN plays a critical role in modulating the host response to schistosomal parasites, and it interacts with Helicobacter pylori, while DC-SIGNR facilitates infection of hepatocytes, by presenting hepatitis C virus on liver endothelial cells. 7 DC-SIGNR also promotes transmission of human immunodeficiency virus across the placenta. 8 These differences in the biological properties of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are mirrored by differences in their molecular properties. For example, although both receptors bind to highmannose oligosaccharides, these are the only glycans that are detected in glycan array analysis of DC-SIGNR, while the presence of key residues in the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of DC-SIGN, particularly Val351, supports binding to fucosylated Lewis-type oligosaccharide structures as well. 9 Such differences probably explain why DC-SIGN binds to parasites that are rich in such structures, while DC-SIGNR does not. 10, 11 In addition to these differences in the ligand-binding domains of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, there appear to be significant but less well understood differences in their overall architectures ( Figure 1A ,B). In both receptors, the carbohydrate-recognition domains are projected from the cell surface by a neck domain comprising multiple copies of a 23-amino acid repeat sequence, but the number of copies of the repeat is largely fixed fixed at 7.5 in DC-SIGN, while polymorphisms in the gene for DC-SIGNR result in variant forms of the neck containing between 4.5 and 9.5 repeats. 12, 13 The allele frequency of the 7.5-repeat variant is over 50% in the human population, but the frequencies of the 6.5and 5.5-repeat variants are 12\u00c016% and 26\u00c037%, respectively. Different neck-length genotypes have been associated with variations in susceptibility to certain viral infections. The 7.5-repeat form is more common in HIV-infected individuals than in uninfected individuals. 14 However, this correlation with HIV susceptibility has not been observed in all cases. 12 The presence of 4.5repeat and 9.5-repeat variants correlates with decreased viral load in hepatitis C virus infection. 15 The shorter necks are also associated with diminished rates of SARS coronavirus infection. 16 It is also noteworthy that the neck repeat adjacent to the CRD of DC-SIGNR differs significantly in sequence from the Biochemistry ARTICLE corresponding sequence in DC-SIGN. Recent structural analysis of a truncated form of the neck domain of DC-SIGNR, combined with a structure of the final neck repeat attached to the CRD, has indicated that a phenylalanine in the final neck repeat of DC-SIGNR causes the polypeptides forming the necks to splay apart at this point. 17 In DC-SIGN, the presence of a valine residue at this position suggests that the neck could remain packed as they are in the other neck repeats, thereby placing the CRDs closer to each other. Thus, differences in the neck regions of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR may also contribute to differences in their interactions with pathogens.",

HEPES was purchased from Fisher Bioreagents (Fair Lawn, NJ), and all other high-purity salts were from Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The neoglycolipid Man 9 GlcNAc 2 -DPPE was synthesized according to described procedures. 18 DC-SIGNR Expression and Purification. Restriction fragments from vectors used for bacterial expression of the extracellular domains of three variants of human DC-SIGNR 19 were moved into a vector encoding an N-terminal His 6 tag previously designed for use with DC-SIGN. 18 The vector encodes the sequence Met-Ala-His-His-His-His-His-His-Gly-Glu-Leu, which begins at residue 101 of the full-length DC-SIGNR protein, and corresponds to the middle of the first 23-amino acid repeat in the extracellular domain. The tagged protein was purified by affinity chromatography on mannose\u00c0Sepharose following the protocol used for the untagged extracellular domain. 20 The affinity purification confirms that the CRDs are folded and active. Biochemistry ARTICLE DC-SIGNR Immobilization on Planar Lipid Bilayers. The recombinant proteins with hexahistidine tags at the N-termini of the extracellular segments of DC-SIGNR were immobilized on asymmetric, planar lipid bilayers, which were supported on mica sheets affixed to hemicylindrical silica disks with 1\u00c02 cm radii of curvature. 18 The first layer is a gel phase DPPE monolayer that was transferred at a surface pressure of 38 mN/m by Langmuir\u00c0 Blodgett deposition onto the mica. DPPE was transferred from a pure water subphase at 21\u00b0C. At this temperature and pressure, the area per lipid is 43 \u00c5 2 . The outer leaflet is a 100% NTA-TRIG-DLGE monolayer deposited onto the DPPE monolayer at 65 \u00c5 2 per lipid, from a subphase of buffer A (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaNO 3 , 3 mM Ca(NO 3 ) 2 , and 50 \u03bcM NiSO 4 at pH 7.8) at 21\u00b0C. The deposition surface pressure was 35 mN/m, and the NTA-TRIG-DLGE monolayer is in the fluid phase at 21\u00b0C. The resulting supported bilayer was kept under buffer A at all times. It was then incubated for 1.5 h with 0.5 \u03bcM of either of the hexahistidine-tagged 7-, 6-, or 5-repeat DC-SIGNR variants in buffer A.

Assuming a linear dependence of the refractive index on surface concentration, the surface coverage \u0393 (molecules/m 2 ) of the different DC-SIGNR variants was calculated from the refractive indices and use of a refractive index increment dn/dc of 0.187, where c is the surface concentration in mg/m 2 . 22, 23 The error in protein densities determined from refractive index measurements is \u223c20%. 22, 23 This analysis differs slightly from that used previously (see Supporting Information). 18 The protein (tetramer) densities of the 7-repeat and 6-repeat forms are determined by dividing the monomer density by four.

The greater uncertainty in determinations of D eq is due to the low force values relative to the measurement uncertainty of (0.03 and the shallow slopes near D eq , especially with the 5-repeat variant (cf.

In the majority of the measurements, at D < D C the force curve is nearly flat for \u223c1.5 nm (Figure 2 ), before increasing more steeply.

All three DC-SIGNR variants exhibit this jump-to-contact behavior, which was also observed in comparable experiments with DC-SIGN. 18 Furthermore, the observation that both D C and D eq are significantly less than D T , despite the presence of the bulky glycan on the target membrane, is attributed to flexibility in the DC-SIGN structure that enables the proteins to undergo a conformational change upon binding the target neoglycolipid. 18 Such protein flexibility would increase the reaction cross section of the CRDs and hence the range of interaction of the CRDs as well as their ability to bind ligands at different, lateral spatial distributions on target surfaces. Both DC-SIGN and all three DC-SIGNR variants exhibit this flexibility, although it is less apparent with the 5-repeat form of DC-SIGNR, due to the weaker attraction.",

In pairwise comparisons, a p value less than 0.05 signifies a statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence level.

The slopes of the curves obtained with the 6-repeat and 7-repeat forms, as well as with DC-SIGN, 18 are indicative of relatively rigid protein layers and hence relatively rigid necks ( Figure 3A,B) . By contrast, the force\u00c0distance curve measured with the 5-repeat form at D < D eq is much shallower and does not increase steeply until D < 4\u00c05 nm ( Figure 3C ), which is the approximate diameter of a folded CRD. 29 The force\u00c0distance profile at D > 4 nm is similar to flexible polymers 30 and suggests that the neck region is unstructured in a significant population of the immobilized 5-repeat protein. The difference between the 5-repeat and other forms of DC-SIGNR and DC-SIGN is attributed to the loss of rigidity conferred by the tetramer. Tetramer dissociation into dimers could also lead to greater protein inactivation under applied force. This exception, relative to the behavior of the stable 6-and 7-repeat tetramers, provides evidence that the rigid neck region and relatively steep force profiles at D < D eq ( Figure 3A,B) requires stable tetramers.",

There is no evidence of irreversible damage to the membranes due to, for example, lipid pull-out or the rupture of the NTA\u00c0hexahistidine linkage. This would be evident in altered force curves measured at the same position after membrane separation, as documented previously. 31 In these studies, Biochemistry ARTICLE upon reapproach after detachment, the measured force curve, D J , and D C were unchanged (Figure 2 ). When separating the surfaces, D Adh and the pull-off force were similar within experimental error, even after as many as seven successive measurements at the same contact site. The average time between successive measurements was 10\u00c015 min, which is too short for damaged membranes to heal 31 but more than sufficient to allow re-equilibration, as evidenced by the reversibility of the measurements. The reversibility is expected because this is a multivalent (number of bonds = 4) interaction, and the affinity of individual monomer\u00c0glycan bonds is relatively low. Leckband et al. 31 showed that lipid pull-out occurs at receptor\u00c0ligand bond energies >\u223c15kT, which is much higher than the energies of the individual monomer\u00c0glycan bonds.

The larger error in the latter reflects the greater uncertainty in the estimated value of D eq , as discussed above. However, the comparative length measurements presented here provide exceptionally important direct experimental evidence that the neck repeat structure, which is observed essentially as a fragment out of context in the crystal structure, is an accurate reflection of the conformation of the neck in the intact molecule.",

These variants have comparable adhesion energies and solution binding affinities. However, disruption of the tetramer in the 5-repeat variant both produces a more flexible/compressible molecule and substantially reduces the adhesion. Further, loss of neck repeats in this variant reduces the extension of the CRDs from the membrane surface-a feature that could reduce access to pathogens.",
