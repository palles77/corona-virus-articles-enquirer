Owing to its involvement in multiple areas, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020. Up to February 26, 2020, there were 78,630 laboratory-confirmed and clinical-confirmed cases in China and over 3,000 cases outside China while about 2/3 of cases in China was located in Wuhan. 1 Zhang et al reported the largest epidemiological investigation of 72314 cases and showed the crude case fatality rate in Hubei province (2.9%) was 7.3 times higher than other provinces (0.4%) in China, 2 which indicated that there are differences in clinical outcome between the patients in Hubei and other provinces. The features and outcomes of patients with COVID- 19 in Wuhan have been described in detail in several studies. Currently, there has been limited studies about patients with COVID-19 in Zhejiang and Beijing, which is far from Hubei. 3, 4 However, the clinical characteristics and progression of disease outside Hubei, especially in areas near Hubei which have a relative higher risk of importing patients than remote areas, were still unknown.",

The proportion of family clusters infection in our study was 39.2% which was lower than other studies. 3 Besides, none of our patient was medical staff while 1080 medical staff were infected in Wuhan until February 11, 2020. 2 For demographic and clinical characteristics, 53.6% patients aged between 15-49 years, followed by the 50-64 years age group (27.5%). In severe/critical group, 32.0% and 40.0% patients aged from 50 to 64 and over 64 respectively, consistent with report of Guan et al. 13 Female and male patients both accounted for half in all three groups. The median time from disease onset to first admission in our study was 5.0 days. Similar to the recent publications, [13] [14] [15] [16] our data also showed that fever, cough and fatigue were the most common symptoms. The severe/critical group patients were more likely to have two or more symptoms at admission. While most symptoms were more frequently seen in severe/critical group, nausea or vomiting were more common in mild group, which may indicate different body responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with different health state and immune system defensive characteristics. 58.0% patients in severe/critical group had at least one underlying disease. In concert with the study of Guan et al, 13 Bases on these findings, we suggest clinicians pay more attention to and closely observe patients with multiple symptoms and underlying diseases to prevent disease deterioration.",

Besides, Obvious disorder of renal function and electrolyte were relatively rare in our patients. 77.6% patients with available coagulation function test result had elevated fibrinogen on admission, and the proportion in severe/critical group was even higher, which have not been observed in other studies. In the early stages of SARS patients, researchers also found an increase in fibrinogen. 18 Previous studies had shown that SARS-CoV 3a protein can up regulate the expression of fibrinogen in lung epithelial cells. 19 We speculate in the lung inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 or the secondary systemic inflammation, the activated body stress system may lead to the increase of fibrinogen. Another interesting phenomenon was that considerable proportion of patients had positive results in Mycoplasma pneumonia or Chlamydia pneumonia antibody tests, which indicate Mycoplasma pneumonia or Chlamydia pneumonia co-infection, which was higher than other research.",
