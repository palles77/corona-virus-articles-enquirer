The etiologic agent of SARS was named 'SARS-associated coronavirus' (SARS-CoV) that can be detected with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. In this study, 12 sets of nested primers covering the SARS-CoV genome have been screened and showed sufficient sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV in RNA isolated from virus cultured in Vero 6 cells. To optimize further the reaction condition of those nested primers sets, seven sets of nested primers have been chosen to compare their reverse transcribed efficiency with specific and random primers, which is useful to combine RT with the first round of PCR into a one-step RT-PCR. Based on the sensitivity and simplicity of results, the no. 73 primer set was chosen as the candidate primer set for clinical diagnoses. To specify the amplicon to minimize false positive results, a Taqman RT-nested PCR system of no. 73 nested primer set was developed. Through investigations on a test panel of whole blood obtained from 30 SARS patients and 9 control persons, the specificity and sensitivity of the Taqman RT-nested PCR system was found to be 100 and 83%, respectively, which suggests that the method is a promising one to diagnose SARS in early stages.",

In the absence of effective drugs and vaccines for SARS, rapid identification of this disease is of importance for controlling spread. At present, virus isolation by cell culture, ELISA, IFA and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the major methods to diagnose SARS. ELISA and IFA methods depend on the detection of IgG and/or IgM against SARS-CoV virus that emerged in the blood during the later phase of infection Drosten et al., 2003) . There is a critical need for a test that can detect SARS at early stages of illness (days 1-3) since persons infected with the SARS-CoV can infect a large number of individuals easily (Rosling and Rosling, 2003) . The detection of viral RNA with RT-PCR assays is the most widely used approach for early detection of pathogens Poon et al., 2003) . Based on the genomic sequence of BJ01 (accession number: AY278488), 12 sets of nested primers covering SARS-CoV have been synthesized. In this study a methodology for selecting the no. 73 nested primers as the most promising primers for clinical purposes and a Taqman RT-nested PCR system using the no. 73 nested primer set are described, and the system was evaluated on a test panel.",

The results showed that three out of seven sets of nested primers have better efficiency on templates reverse transcribed with the specific primer, and three other sets of primers showed that the reverse transcription with the random primer has higher efficiency than with the specific primer. It is worthy to note that the four sets of nested primers located on the terminus of the genome have higher efficiency when transcribed with the random primer.

The spike (S) protein, together with the E and M proteins, constitute the components of the surface of coronaviruses. The replicase (R) protein, which occurs in limited amounts, including 1a and 1b is the defined unique non-structural protein responsible for RNA replication. According to the Northern blot, the subgenomic regions for S, M, and E are transcribed in larger quantities . With the 10-fold diluted RNA as template, the sensitivity of primers targeting the S, M, E, and N proteins is higher than 10-100-fold than those primers targeting the R protein, which suggests that the sensitivity of detection is determined mostly by the quantity of transcripts.",

Compared with longer PCR products, this range and flexibility enables many assays to be produced successfully. For these primers, the reverse transcriptions with random primer and specific primer have different effects.

The Taqman system was developed by ABI and employs a fluoregenic probe-based 5 , exonuclease technology that enables amplification and detection to be carried out simultaneously, eliminating the need for post-PCR analysis (Heid et al., 1996; Fortin et al., 2001) . Use of the fluorescent probe in real time PCR provides an additional level of assay specificity. Although fluorescence increases in direct proportion to the amount of specific amplicons, the Taqman probe was used to specify the product in this study because the fluorescence increases non-linearly in the second round of amplification compared with the original virus RNA concentration. To confirm positive amplicon, the PCR procedure should include appropriate negative and positive controls in each run, including negative and positive controls for the extraction procedure and the PCR run.",
