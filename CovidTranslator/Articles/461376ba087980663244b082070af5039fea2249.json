Exposure to infection might be more likely in animals than in human beings, given their closer relationship with the natural habitat of the yeast, vegetation and soil. Thus, animals, and especially pets, can act as indicators of the presence of this yeast in a determined area. Domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) have become common pets in the past 10-20 years. Their natural behavior of sniffing around and going inside narrow spaces makes them prone to contact with decaying organic matter and soil, the substrate for Cryptococcus species. This study describes two cases of cryptococcosis in ferrets in the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands and documents a relationship of ferret cryptococcosis with environmental isolates in the same locations. Here, we emphasize the importance of how an adequate identification and environmental search of the yeast leads to a better understanding of the epidemiology of cryptococcosis and suggests ferrets may act as sentinels for this fungal disease.",

Cytological analysis of this mass obtained by fine-needle aspiration revealed large colonies of yeast like cells with a thick clear halo that did not pick up Indian ink morphologically suggestive of Cryptococcus spp. A 6-week course of itraconazole (10 mg/kg/po/sid) was initiated and the cough resolved during the fourth week of treatment. At that time, a second sample was taken by fineneedle aspiration from the same thoracic mass. The culture in brain-heart infusion broth and on Sabouraud dextrose agar yielded yeast colonies that were identified as C. gattii and molecularly characterized by AFLP fingerprinting as genotype AFLP6/VGII. The cryptococcal isolate was deposited in the yeast collection of the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre with accession number CBS12659. Control chest radiographs were taken 2 months later and did not show any masses. Cryptococcal blood antigen levels were undetectable. One year after the initial presentation, this ferret was found dead without any prior respiratory symptoms. Postmortem studies were not performed.",

Of these, two cases came from Europe, one from the United Kingdom and the other from Spain [15] , the latter corresponding to case number three in the current study. No other cases of cryptococcosis in ferrets have been reported since then. The two newly described cases of cryptococcosis in ferrets in this study corresponded to infections caused by C. neoformans variety grubii genotype AFLP1/ VNI (case 1) and by C. gattii genotype AFLP6/VGII (case 2). Environmental sampling in the vicinity of the house where the ferret from case 1 resided yielded five isolates of the same species, variety and genotype, namely C. neoformans var. grubii genotype AFLP1/ VNI ( Table 3 ). The molecular characterization of these isolates and their genetic profiles evidenced a very close relationship between them suggesting the same origin and the acquisition of the disease from natural sources. In case 2, all environmental samples obtained from the surroundings of the house, as well as nasal swabs from the owner and a companion ferret, were negative. Cryptococcosis in ferrets has been reported in areas where the presence of C. gattii has been extensively documented, such as Australia and Vancouver Island (Canada) [16, 17] . Reports from other geographical areas are scarce [14] . The low number of cases in ferrets may be due to a real low incidence but also to the fact that ferrets became popular pets quite recently. This social change could increase significantly the chance for the detection of diseases affecting this species. Therefore, it is difficult to infer whether these cases of cryptococcosis in ferrets correspond to a real epidemiological change in the global distribution of Cryptococcus in the environment.",
