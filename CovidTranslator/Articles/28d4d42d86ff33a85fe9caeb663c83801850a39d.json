The etiologic agent of SARS has been identified as a novel SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) whose virions are composed of four proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Ksiazek et al. 2003 , Peiris et al. 2003 . The N protein binds to a defined packaging signal on the RNA, leading to formation of the helical nucleocapsids. The E protein is a minor yet critical structural component in coronavirus assembly because virus-like particles (VLP) can form upon co-expression with M protein, whereas expression of M protein alone does not produce VLP (Bos et al. 1996) .",

The development of either vaccines or diagnostic reagents often requires large quantities of recombinant proteins. Currently, research efforts have mostly been directed toward exploring the potentials of S, M and N proteins for these purposes, but relevant studies concerning the potential of E protein is absent. Although the functions of E protein are partly known, a detailed characterization of E protein has been impeded due to its very low abundance in the virus and in the infected cells. To test the possible applications of E protein as vaccines or diagnostic reagents and to investigate the fundamental roles in pathogenesis, purified E proteins are desired. To address this need, the expression of histidine-tagged SARS-CoV E protein using the baculovirus system and its purification using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) are reported here and the proteins are compared with those of SARS-CoV N proteins.",

These two proteins exhibited striking differences in expression levels and physical properties which, in turn, affected the purifica- tion schemes. The N protein is a major constituent of the coronavirus virion and can be expressed to high levels in the cytoplasm and nucleolus of insect cells (Ren et al. 2004 ). Our confocal microscopy data confirmed that the majority of rNH protein was localized within the nucleus. Such protein is very suitable for expression using the baculovirus/insect cell system as the yield of other similar viral proteins is very high (Hu et al. 2002) . It is therefore not surprising that our specific yield of rNH amounted up to %90 lg/10 6 cells at 3 dpi as estimated by scanning densitometry. On the other hand, the E protein of other coronaviruses is present in minute amounts on the envelope, and is reported to target to the Golgi complex (Corse & Machamer 2000) . Our confocal microscopy data and the finding that rEH is tightly bound to intracellular membranes also support this notion. The excessive overexpression of such membrane protein inevitably undermines the secretion, sorting and modification of cellular proteins, hence the maximum specific yield of rEH protein was only 12.5 lg/10 6 cells at 3 dpi as estimated by densitometry, which was %7-fold lower compared to rNH protein.",

The onset of rEH expression was concurrent with the dramatic decrease in viability, implying a correlation between the rEH expression and cell viability. Therefore, the quick drop of viability was originally deemed a result of apoptosis induced by rEH protein because the E protein of mouse hepatitis virus (also a coronavirus) induces apoptosis in cultured cells (An et al. 1999) . However, no signs of DNA fragmentation, a characteristic of apoptosis, were observed in the vBacEH-infected cells even at 3 dpi (unpublished observation). Another possibility to account for the rapid death is that rEH protein permeabilized the cell membrane, caused the infiltration of Trypan Blue dye, and contributed to the rapid ''cell death'', because SARS-CoV E protein was recently suggested to be a viroporin that can alter the membrane permeability upon expression in E. coli (Liao et al. 2004) .",

These properties contributed to its high solubility in the NBB buffer which, in turn, enabled simple purification of rNH protein in a single step using IMAC. In marked contrast, SARS-CoV E protein contains a transmembrane domain (aa 12--34) that forms an unusual palindromic helical hairpin around a pseudo-center of symmetry (Arbely et al. 2004) . Furthermore, SARS-CoV E protein was recently suggested to form cation-selective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers (Wilson et al. 2004) , which supports the notion that SARS-CoV E protein forms an oligomer (Liao et al. 2004 ). These characteristics might account for its strong propensity to associate with the membrane. Albeit uncommon, such oligomer could have formed detergent-resistant structures (Weisz et al. 1993 , Sevier & Machamer 1998 , so that the detergents commonly used for solubilizing integral membrane proteins failed to completely solubilize rEH. In this study, we have tested parameters such as salt concentrations (0.15--1 M NaCl), sonication time (0.5--1.5 min per 0.5 ml solution), incubation time (30 min to overnight) (data not shown) and detergent types (see Figure 4 ) in order to extract rEH from the pellets more efficiently, but only a limited degree of success was achieved. The rEH protein could only be completely released from the cellular pellets when a two-stage process incorporating 8 M urea in the second stage was adopted. One benefit of this process was that lots of other soluble, contaminating materials were removed in the first stage, thus reducing the complexity in the subsequent IMAC purification.",

Equally important is the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs to prevent or treat the disease. Among the known SARS-CoV proteins, N protein has been demonstrated to be a valuable marker for early detection of SARS-CoV infection (Che et al. 2004) . Furthermore, recent publications have suggested that N protein is involved not only in capsid assembly, but also in the activation of AP1-pathway (He et al. 2003) and in the induction of apoptosis in COS-1 cells (Surjit et al. 2004) , indicating that N protein may serve as a target molecule for the development of vaccine or antiviral drugs. On the other hand, the roles of E protein are poorly characterized comparing to S, M and N proteins, probably due to its small size and low abundance in the virions. Although SARS-CoV E protein is shown to form ion channels, whether the ion channel activity is involved in the known physiological roles remains to be investigated. Also, SARS-CoV E protein is recently suggested to be a viroporin, disruption of the E protein functions thus may possibly abrogate viral infectivity, rendering SARS-CoV E protein a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs. All these together further substantiate the importance of producing and purifying SARS-CoV N and E proteins in the heterologous expression system. Although many reports concerning the expression and purification of SARS-CoV N protein have been published, however, the expression of SARS-CoV E protein in the eucaryotic system and its purification have yet to be reported, probably due to its lower expression level and extra difficulty in purification. Our system thus provides a tool for the expression and purification of SARS-CoV E protein and may facilitate the development of diagnostic kits, vaccines or antiviral drugs against SARS.",
