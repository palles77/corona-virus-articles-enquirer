The sequence of the 3D region of the kobuvirus genome is highly conserved and encodes the enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). By contrast, the VP1 protein is the most exposed region of the picornavirus capsid and has a high probability of structural variation. This characteristic makes the VP1 gene the Abstract Aichivirus B has been reported worldwide in calves and adult cattle with and without diarrhea. The aim of this study was to describe the molecular characteristics of the RdRP and VP1 genes of aichivirus B strains identified as the most frequent etiologic agent in a neonatal diarrhea outbreak in a high-production Brazilian dairy cattle herd. Preliminary laboratory analysis ruled out important enteropathogens (Cryptosporidium spp; Eimeria spp., E. coli F5, and bovine coronavirus). Fecal samples from diarrheic (n = 24) and asymptomatic (n = 5) calves up to 30 days old were collected for virological analysis. RT-PCR assays were performed for the detection of aichivirus B RdRP and VP1 genes and for rotavirus A VP7 and VP4 genes in fecal samples. Asymptomatic calves (control group) were negative for both viruses. Aichivirus B and rotavirus A G10P [11] genotypes were found in 54.2% (13/24) and 25% (6/24) of the diarrheic fecal samples, respectively. Aichivirus B was only identified (83.3%, 10/12) in calves up to two weeks old. Phylogenetic analysis 1 3 most useful one for distinguishing different members of the genus Kobuvirus [22, 25] .",

However, the genomic region used for a classification of picornaviruses by molecular analysis is the VP1 capsid protein gene [22] . Therefore, the Brazilian aichivirus B VP1 gene sequences were classified in putative lineage 1, revealing greater (89.2 to 89.5%) nucleotide sequence identity to the aichivirus B prototype strain (U-I, accession numbers AB084788, NC004421) according to the classification proposed in 2014 by Chang and colleagues suggesting new genotype or lineage with a cutoff of 85.1% nucleotide sequence identity based on VP1 protein of aichivirus B. This result confirms the molecular diversity of aichivirus B strains circulating worldwide and demonstrates that the strains identified in South America exhibit molecular divergence from Chinese strains.",
