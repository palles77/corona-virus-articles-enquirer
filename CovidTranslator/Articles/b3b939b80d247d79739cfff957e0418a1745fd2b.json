Ishida's group thought that from the therapeutic point of view, it would be desirable to develop noncovalent-type low-molecular-weight version of E-64 and its analogues for cathepsin B. Epoxy-free versions of known inhibitors such as CA074 were tested, but due to the lack of an epoxy ring in CA074 led to a considerable loss of inhibitory activity. The strategy that they follow was to design compounds that are able to block both S n and S n \u02b9 subsites simultaneously. Thus, compounds were constructed by manual model building based on X-rays atomic coordinates of cathepsin B-E-64c and B-CA074 complexes, and the possible binding modes and energetic stability of these candidates at the active site of cathepsin B were simulated by molecular dynamics (MD) calculations [27] . Among all synthetized compounds, CAA0445, which includes the peptide structure of both E-64c and CA074 (Fig. 6.6 ), exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity (initial IC 50 < 100 nM). MD simulation suggested that the interactions between cathepsin B and CAA0445 were all conserved ( Fig. 6.7) .",

A similar chemical structure to the epoxide is an aziridine, also a three-membered ring with an atom of nitrogen instead of oxygen. These chemical analogues were first synthesized and tested against cysteine proteases by Martichonok et al. [28] . They published some aziridine E-64 analogues and compared the bioactivity against different cysteine protease versions of previously synthetized E-64 epoxy analogues. One of the most interesting conclusions this publication brings is the fact that pH dependency for the inactivation of the enzyme is quite different for the aziridine inhibitors compared with the epoxide inhibitors. This effect can be explained because aziridine ring has the potential to be easily protonated on the nitrogen atom. In addition, aziridines have been shown to be more reactive at low pH [29] , and in contrast to E-64, this protonation is likely to occur in the pH range where cysteine proteases are active (optimal pH \u223c 4.5 for lysosomal activity).

(2) The selection of proper protecting groups that allow for a selective unmasking of the N-terminus and also protecting/deprotecting friendly conditions with the double bond present in the vinylogous arginine. Thus, the Bpoc/Boc combination for fragments 4 and 5, respectively, was selected. Starting from 4, miraziridine A was synthetized with a 16% overall yield. Synthetic miraziridine A was tested against trypsin (serine protease), cathepsin B, and cathepsin L (cysteine proteases), as well as pepsin (aspartyl protease), obtaining chain-unprotected vArg-OEt at the late stage of the backbone construction, which makes it possible to adopt a convenient solid-phase procedure for the fragment preparation [34] .

That suggested the facile formation of a hemiacetal with water or MeOH. Interpretation of 2D NMR data confirmed the presence of the methyl hemiacetal in CD 3 OH. Further NMR data led to all structural subunits, and the extracted conclusions were that tokaramide A exists in equilibrium mixture of aldehyde, hemiacetal, and cyclic carbinolamine.

One of these compounds is gallinamide A (Fig. 6.13 ). However, this compound has majorly been studied for its activity against malaria; recent studies have found that gallinamide A offers inhibitory activity against human cathepsins [39] . [40] . After isolating the bioactive compound via HPLC-MS, they performed a series of NMR experiments to elucidate the structure. The absolute configuration of the stereocenters was assigned by subsequent degradation and derivatization. However, they were not able to determine the absolute configuration of the carbon atoms on the N,N-dimethyl isoleucine residue. Curiously, the same year another natural product with the same structure, isolated from Symploca cyanobacteria, was reported on the literature, namely symplostatin 4 [41] . In this paper, configuration for all stereocenters was assigned, being (S, S) for the two stereocenters on the N,N-dimethyl isoleucine residue. Nevertheless, they ensured that symplostatin 4 was a different compound from gallinamide A, probably a diastereomer, because the NMR spectrum of both compounds was slightly different. The doubt was not cleared up until the total synthesis of the compound and the possible diastereomers was reported.",

The chemical structures were elucidated using NMR, X-rays, and MS experiments, and it was observed that the difference between three grassypeptolides resided in only two of the residues (Fig. 6.16 ). Moreover, A and C were found to be epimers. The question that worried the researchers is whether the intact molecules can interconvert. There is some precedent for similar natural products for example, a synthetic diastereomer of lissoclinamide 7 showed conversion to the natural isomer in the presence of pyridine and CDCl 3 at 60\u00b0C, although the reverse conversion was not observed [47] . Using these same conditions, Luesch's group was not able to convert intact grassypeptolide C into grassypeptolide A or vice versa. A reduced tendency for base-induced interconversion may reflect less overall strain in the macrocycle; grassypeptolides A and C are 31-membered, whereas lissoclinamide 7 is 21-membered.",

In addition, the total syntheses of these compounds have been reported as a mixture of enantiomers, via Diels-Alder cyclohexenyl formation by Porco et al. [56, 57] . Majumdar et al. used the reported syntheses by Porco to obtain enough amounts of compound in order to perform a series of experiments to relate the bioactivity of these cyclohexenyl chalcones with cathepsin inhibition and compare the results with the activity of the natural extracts [51] . Cytotoxicity assays with racemic panduratin A and nicolaioidesin C against human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells PC-3 and DU-145 showed an estimated IC 50 of 4 \u03bcM for panduratin A and 20 \u03bcM for nicolaioidesin C, which is consistent with the activity for the natural extracts. Synthetic panduratin A was subjected to protease profiling experiments and the results demonstrated that panduratin A possesses substantial inhibitory activity against cathepsins G, H, K, L, S, V, and X. Both synthetic (+) and (\u2212)-panduratin A enantiomers were also tested for their ability to inhibit selected cathepsins. The IC 50 values of (+) and (\u2212) were similar to those determined for the racemic mixture. While nicolaioidesin C was not subjected to a full protease profiling protocol, selected assays demonstrated anticathepsin K activity (IC 50 = 4.4 \u03bcM) similar to that observed for panduratin A. Importantly, protease profiling assays of panduratin A did not show activities against other classes of proteases, including matrix metalloproteases, caspases, and papain. Based on protease profiling results and the significance of cathepsin L in prostate cancer, Majumdar et al. also tested the synthetic racemic cyclohexenyl chalcone compounds in a cell-free human cathepsin L enzyme assay. Using the nonselective protease inhibitor E-64 as a positive control, the presence of panduratin A and nicolaioidesin C resulted in significantly reduced human cathepsin L enzyme activity, with a calculated IC 50 of 1.8 and 1 \u03bcM, respectively.",

Polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol (PPAP) isolated from those plants, have gained interest due to their many biological properties, such as anticancer, antiviral, anticonceptive, or antiinflammatory [58] [59] [60] . Martins et al. have published a study which describes the in vitro inhibitory activity of three natural products isolated from Garcinia brasiliensis against different cysteine and serine proteases, including cathepsin B and cathepsin G, respectively [61] , namely guttiferone A, 7-epiclusianone, and garciniaphenone ( Fig. 6.18 ). These natural polyprenylated benzophenones were isolated from the ethanolic and hexanic extracts of G. brasiliensis dried and powdered seeds and fruits, as it has been previously reported by them [62] [63] [64] and were tested for their potential to inhibit papain, trypsin, and cathepsins B and G by spectrofluorometric measurements. Referring to cathepsins, leupeptin and chymostatin were used as reference inhibitors in the trials of cathepsin B and cathepsin G, respectively. One of the benzophenone derivatives, guttiferone A, has avidly inhibited all assayed enzymes with different degrees of selectivity for the proteases. It is important to highlight that its IC 50 value (2.7 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM) against cathepsin G is almost the same to that obtained from the classical inhibitor of serine proteases, chymostatin (2.1 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM). On cathepsin B, guttiferone A was also the most active compound of the series (2.1 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM). However, in this case the activity was lower than the control compound leupeptin (0.047 \u00b1 0.003 \u03bcM). The other two natural products gave lower inhibition values, for 7-epiclusianone IC 50 values were 73.7 \u00b1 5.8 \u03bcM and 37.9 \u00b1 2.1 \u03bcM for cathepsin B and cathepsin G, respectively, while garciniaphenone offered IC 50 values of 103.5 \u00b1 4.4 \u03bcM and 97.6 \u00b1 5.2 \u03bcM.",

SAR studies were also performed for guttiferone A with flexible docking simulations. Then it was stated that the presence of the bicycle[3.3.1]-nonanetrione and 13,14-dihydroxy substituted phenyl groups and keto-enol tautomeric form [63] where the bridge carbon is hydroxylated enhances the enzymatic inhibitory activity [61] . Likewise this biological effect on serine and cysteine proteases improves according to the number of prenyl groups attached at the diphenylmethanone moiety and the coplanarity between bridge hydroxyl/carbonyl and 13,14-dihydroxyphenyl/phenyl groups. Further research performed by Murata et al. linked the activity against cathepsins B and G of garciniaphenone and 7-epiclusianone with the antiproliferative effect in various cancer cells [65] . Again, better results were observed for the molecule with more prenyl groups.

The collection of natural products included seven alkaloids, seven flavonoids, and two triterpenes, and the natural flavonoid quercetin was used as a standard for all tested proteases. Among the tested compounds, the triterpenes inhibited all the proteases at the \u03bcM scale, while most alkaloids barely had any effect on any protease (IC 50 > 1 mM). Some flavonoids moderately inhibited urokinase, but many of them inhibited cathepsin B. The compound with major activity was the triterpene \u03b2-ursolic acid (Fig. 6.19 ) which inhibited cathepsin B (IC 50 = 10 \u03bcM) similar to the standard (IC 50 = 11 \u03bcM). The effect of \u03b2-ursolic acid that inhibited in vitro cell growth of a large list of cancer cell lines including mouse melanoma B16 cells [68] was evaluated in vivo at daily doses of 50, 75, and 100 mg/kg for its ability to inhibit lung colonization. No mortality and no body weight changes were observed at chosen doses. The most interesting fact is that the macroscopic appearance of the lungs from untreated and treated mice clearly showed that ursolic acid at the dose of 50 mg/kg reduced the number of lung metastases, but the effect was lower at higher doses. Unfortunately, this fact was not explained, and along with the mechanism of ursolic acid action should be further investigated.",

However, only 3-oxo-urs-12-en-28-oic acid showed significant selectivity when comparing inhibitory activity of rCPB2.8 and human cathepsin L. In constrast, the inhibitory activity was 27-fold higher for rCPB2.8 compared to human cathepsin L, while for the rest of compounds this ratio was reduced to 1.5-to 2-fold higher for rCPB2.8 compared to human cathepsin L. Kinetic studies of the inhibitory activity against rCPB2.8 were also performed for all compounds, except for quercetin. Experiments showed partially noncompetitive inhibition for agathisflavone and 3-oxo-urs-12-en-28-oic acid, and uncompetitive inhibition for tetrahydrorobustaflavone.

In addition to the polar contacts, nonpolar interactions contribute to the orientation of 7 in the cathepsin V binding site. In conclusion, SAR and computational studies highlighted acridone 7 as a lead compound for designing synthetic competitive inhibitors of cathepsin V, as it has been reported recently by the same research group [84] .",

Numerous potent inhibitors of cathepsin K have already been identified from natural sources including epoxide inhibitors such as E-64 [87] as well as various small peptide-based aldehydes of natural product origin as leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, and alpha-MAPI mentioned above. These compounds, together with pepstatin [88] are all potent cathepsin K inhibitors (antipain gave K i = 41 nM against cathepsin K). However, they are not selective enough at inhibiting only one protease and instead inhibit a whole array of cysteine and serine proteases rendering the inhibitors too toxic for therapeutic use [89] . Two antipain analogues have been recently isolated from L-91-3 strain of Streptomyces collected in the rainforests of British Columbia [90] displaying inhibition activity against cathepsin K. Lichostatinal (Fig. 6.24) is a tripeptide aldehyde (Ser-Ile-Arg-H) with agmatine attached by urea linkage to the \u03b1-amino group of Ser. Agmatine is a decarboxylated arginine. Lichostatinal is the first example of a natural product to be isolated from a complex mixture by co-crystallization with its biological target [90] . Second compound named as vince-2 results from dehydration of cycloarginine in antipain. This compound is a cathepsin K inhibitor displaying a value of K i = 295 nM.",
