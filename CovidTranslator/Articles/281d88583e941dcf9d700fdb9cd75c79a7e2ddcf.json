Some processes among them are irreversible, such as helix hairpin formation of the ectodomain, whereas others are reversible, such as exposure of the fusion peptide. Using this property, we attempted to dissect, in temporal order, different stages of the fusion reaction involving the fusion peptide by an acidic-neutral-acidic pH cycle. The fluorescence-quenching data indicated that both insertion depth and self-assembly are pH-reversible. In addition, lipid mixing assay was demonstrated to be arrested by neutral pH. By contrast, membrane leakage was shown to be irreversible with respect to pH. Our results, along with those from other studies on the pH-dependence of membrane fusion, are used to build a model for the virus-mediated fusion event from the perspective of pHreversibility.",

            "text": "The fusion activity of the influenza virus is pH-dependent. Entry of the virus into the target cell is effected by fusion of the viral and cell membranes at the endosomal pH (\u2248 5) in a multi-step mode involving various parts of the fusion protein and co-ordination of neighbouring protein molecules. Examination of the response of different components of the fusion protein to pH change can provide valuable insight into the complex fusion reaction [1] [2] [3] [4] . It was demonstrated, by biochemical measurements [5] , that the proteolytic fragment of HA2 (haemagglutinin HA2 subunit), TBHA2, consisting of residues 38-175, folds spontaneously into a low-pH conformation, implying that the fusogenic structure is thermodynamically stable and thus is pH-irreversible. A similar proposition has been put forward by Carr and Kim [6] for a synthetic peptide encompassing the coiled-coil domain of HA2. It has been shown that the six-helix bundle of the ectodomain of HIV-1 gp41 (transmembrane glycoprotein 41) is highly thermodynamically stable [7] , hence the formation of this core structure is an irreversible process in virus-mediated fusion. The assertion is supported by a recent study on the kinetics of cell-cell fusion induced by the HIV fusion protein [8] . It was found that folding of the helix bundle occurs immediately following formation of the nascent fusion pore, indicating that the helix bundle is probably a post-fusion structure or at least a late product of the fusion reaction. A kinetic study of the fusion process under sub-optimal conditions, for example, lowering the temperature, enabled a dissection of fusion intermediates. Thus Markosyan et al. [9] found that the rate-limiting step of the influenza-HA (haemagglutinin)-induced fusion occurs after the intermediate captured by employing a lower temperature; Leikina et al. [10] examined the irreversible steps of the HA refolding by varying the incubation time at pH 5.0 or 7.4 at 22 \u2022 C.",

Thus, following a neutral-to-fusogenic pH change, an essential early step of the process is exposure of the Nterminal FP (fusion peptide) of the membrane-anchored subunit HA2, leading to its protrusion towards, and subsequent insertion into, the target membrane. This process has been shown to be pHreversible by a fluorescence study probed by bis-ANS [4,4 -bis-(1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulphonate)] binding to the virus [3] . In particular, binding of an N-terminal 20-mer FP to the fluorophore bis-ANS was shown to decrease significantly with increasing pH. In addition, the ability to mediate mixing of phospholipid vesicles by the synthetic 23-mer and 20-mer peptides corresponding to the FP region of HA2 was demonstrated to be reversible in response to pH change [4, 11] .",

Using fluorescence-quenching techniques, we showed that the insertion depth and self-assembly of the HA2 FP with membrane bilayer are pH-reversible and that the lipid mixing mediated by the FP can be arrested by neutral pH and the activity resumed with acidification. The latter result is in contrast with the irreversible proceeding of six-helix bundle formation of the HA2 fusion core with respect to pH alteration. A pHcycle experiment probed by a liposome-encapsulated cation leaking into bulk aqueous medium demonstrated that the process involving disruption of both leaflets of the membrane bilayer is pH-unarrestable and hence irreversible. The dissection of the reversible, arrestable and irreversible processes in the pathway of the fusion reaction illustrated in our proposed scheme may afford a better understanding of this complex event. Taking these data along with the premise that, in general, reversible and arrestable steps are followed by irreversible ones, we constructed a working model for the HA-induced membrane fusion. Our findings can be compared with the scheme advocated recently by Markosyan et al. [8] . All reagents were used in the experiments without further purification.",

The former represents inter-trimer association, whereas the latter reflects intra-trimer association. Both sets of results show that FP has higher propensity for self-assembly at acidic pH in a pH-reversible manner. Leakage is monitored by Tb 3+ fluorescence increase resulting from complexing with DPA. In the continuous curve (--) the continually increased intensity at neutral pH after acidic pH activation of the HA2(1-25)-promoted leakage shows that the process is not pH-arrestable. In the \u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7 trace, the E1 analogue is shown to cause a low level of membrane rupture. In particular, the neutral pH stage does not exhibit an abrupt increase in the extent of leakage, in support of the idea that the observed membrane leakage is dominantly induced by the fusion-active FP molecules.

A control experiment in which the pH was kept constant at 5.0 exhibited a gradual decrease in the mixing rate. Note that the extent of mixing is higher for the final low-pH stage in the data for the pH cycle than for the control result. The large increase in lipid mixing at the second stage of re-acidification displayed in Figure 3 is probably due to a better realignment of the trimeric subunits to proceed to the vesicle merger. A similar result has been documented by Stegmann et al. [12] , who showed an enhanced fusion rate between influenza virus and RBC ghosts obtained with pre-incubation of the mixture at neutral pH and 0 \u2022 C. The gradual levelling off of lipid mixing is likely to be due to a decreased population of the active FPs on the vesicle surface that have free energy available to surmount the barrier to membrane merge. To further check that the observed Rho dequenching arises from organization of active FP molecules, a fusion-inactive analogue, E1-HA2(1-25) [24] was used. A near baseline intensity variation ( Figure 3 , \u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7 trace) is found for the inactive peptide.",

This indicates that the leakage is not arrested by neutral pH, in sharp contrast with the data in Figure 3 , which indicated an arrest in lipid mixing by neutral pH. Similarly, minimal membrane leakage can be detected for the inactive E1 analogue, demonstrating that the observed activity for HA2(1-25) is mainly due to specific interaction of the active FP molecules with the membrane.

The latter result merits more attention, since lipid mixing requires appropriate co-operation of neighbouring FP molecules. It is proposed that the lateral diffusion of the FPs and recruitment of adjacent trimer subunits surrounding the fusing site accounts for the bulk of experimentally observed delay time in initiating membrane fusion, which decreases sharply with increased surface density of the fusion proteins [23, 25] . This hypothesis is also supported by a report that the transition from reversible to irreversible forms of HA depends on its surface density [10] . Because self-association of the FP molecules is pHreversible, Figure 2 indicates that the clustering of FP in the target membrane is not part of a rate-limiting irreversible step of the fusion event. The data presented in Figures 1 and 2 suggest that the pH-reversible insertion depth and self-association may contribute to the arrest of FP-mediated lipid mixing at neutral pH. In a previous study the secondary structure of HA2(1-25) was found be insensitive to pH variation [18] . By contrast, we observed a greater self-quenching of Rho with acidification for the labelled peptide due to longer range of interaction {of the order of 1.5 nm (15 \u00c5) between the fluorophores; see [26] }. This property was therefore used to obtain the data shown in Figure 2 . That the insertion of FP precedes lipid mixing or membrane fusion was shown by White and co-workers using the disrupted coiledcoil structure of HA that exhibited membrane insertion devoid of membrane fusion [27] .",

Evidence that the former change is more important comes from the secondary-structure analysis. Thus the helical structure encompassing residues 1-11 (see the supplementary data at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/396/bj3960557add.htm) of the FP incorporated into the membrane mimic is stabilized at pH 4.9 compared with that at pH 7.2, as revealed by coupling-constant analysis of the peptide in SDS micelles. The increase in helical structure has been shown to correlate with insertion of the FPs of influenza virus and HIV-1 into the membrane [18, 28] , hence the data in Supplementary Figure S1 (http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/ 396/bj3960557add.htm) suggest a deeper penetration of the Nterminal half of the peptide at acidic pH. Regardless of whether the former alone or both factors cause(s) the observed pH reversibility in K SV , interaction of the FP with the membrane bilayer is clearly shown in the reversible stage of the fusion event. It is noteworthy that Pak et al. [29] have shown that the FP inserted into the target membrane in a pH-reversible manner.",

We have similarly observed neutral-pH-arrested lipid mixing mediated by the HA2 FP (Figure 3 ). Strictly speaking, the arrest of lipid transfer by neutral pH does not reflect a reversible process, but indicates that the FPs, along with the fusing membranes, are brought by re-neutralization to a state incapable of progressing to the next stage which, however, is not necessarily the same as that prior to lowering the pH. In other words, the arrested state is not equivalent to a reversible one. Nonetheless, recovery to the fusogenic state can be obtained by re-acidification at this stage of the fusion reaction.",

Rather, the coalescence of inner leaflets to create membrane continuity and generation of robust pores (according to the model proposed by Markosyan et al. [8] ) probably imposes a higher energy barrier for the fusing partners to complete the fusion. Furthermore, the required energy is provided, at least in part, by helix-bundle formation. Interestingly, in a kinetic study on lipid mixing, Stegmann et al. [30] found that the lag time necessary for virus/liposome mixing is low-pH-dependent, and the process can be arrested by the neutralization that interrupted the low-pH incubation period at various time points (cf. Figure 4 in [30] ), again indicating that the lipid mixing is pH-arrestable. That envelope-induced hemifusion and the nascent fusion pore formation are reversible with respect to pH is implied in a study on the avian sarcoma and leukosis virus with a class I fusion protein [31] . It was concluded that low pH is necessary for the stages leading to hemifusion, but not for pore growth -a result which supports the argument that the pore growth does not require low pH because the process is pHirreversible and hence would proceed regardless of pH variation (i.e. with or without re-neutralization), whereas low pH is needed for reversible processes to proceed forward. The conclusion that the pore-growth step is irreversible is temporally consistent with the hypothesis that this step is energetically driven primarily by an irreversible formation of the helix hairpin in the late stage of the fusion reaction. Skehel and Wiley [32] deduced from the formation of the N-cap clamping of the N-and C-terminal regions of HA2 -presumably the last step of N-and C-helix refoldingthat the free energy of capping is released at a late stage of the fusion events. This energetic consideration will be incorporated into the following fusion model.",

Insertion of the FP into the outer layer of the membrane with a concomitant induction of helical structure [18, 34] releases free energy to facilitate subsequent processes; this is arrestable by neutralization, as suggested by Figure 1 (Figure 5, step 2) . The membrane diffusion of FP leading to self-association can be arrested by neutral pH (Figure 2 ), as shown in step 3 ( Figure 5 ). According to Figure 3 , stalk formation or hemifusion (step 4, Figure 5 ) is also arrestable with elevating pH. The time required for the movement and juxtaposition of adjoining FP subunits may be manifested as delay time in the fusion experiments. It is noted that, in accordance with the finding by Morris et al. [14] , the steps leading up to hemifusion proceed relatively rapidly. The nascent pore with a narrow passage illustrated at step 5 of Figure 5 flickers (opens and closes rapidly), this arising in part from thermal fluctuation (as revealed by patch-clamp experiments [35, 36] ), and eventually dilates to a long-lived pore with the required energy provided by interaction between FP and the transmembrane domain, as well as the formation of helix hairpin bundle [8] synchronized by adjacent trimer subunits. That stable pore formation is irreversible is also supported by a Tb 3+ /DPA leakage experiment ( Figure 4) . Experimental evidence of a significant free-energy barrier for the fusion intermediates to transit to complete fusion was provided by Markosyan et al. [9] from a kinetics study on HA-mediated fusion.

Similarly, exposure of the FP and the ectodomain of HA has been shown to be pH-reversible [3] . That the insertion of FP into the target membrane precedes the refolding of C-helix to the groove formed by the N-terminal coiled coil is consistent with the finding that binding of the FP domain was not affected, but the membrane fusion was impaired, by a double mutation at positions 63 and 70 of HA2 that disrupted coiled-coil formation [27] . In our model, steps 4 and 5, namely the formation of the lipid stalk and the nascent pore, are at the committed state [8, 37] characterized by progress to complete fusion in a highly temperature-dependent fashion. We also note that flickering (rapid opening and closure) of the nascent pore observed in electrophysiological experiments is also reversible [35] at step 5 in our model. It implies that this process precedes the irreversible formation of six-helix hairpin shown in the low-pH crystallographic structure [2, 38] and irreversible stable pore formation (Figure 4) .",

            "text": "Dissociation of HA1 headgroups is assumed to occur between steps 5 and 6. The pH-irreversibility of the pore enlargement is underscored in part by the thermal stability of the helix bundle and the fact that it exists at both acidic and neutral pH [5] . Moreover, completion of packing of the C-helix domain against the N-terminal coiled coil of the fusion protein should take place during the coalescence of the two inner leaflets to provide free energy to facilitate the close-up of fusing membranes. Therefore the latter part of step 5 would overlap step 6. That the helix-bundle formation is at a post-lipid mixing stage can be inferred from the finding of Mu\u00f1oz-Barroso et al. [39] on the inhibition of aqueous content mixing induced by HIV-1 fusion protein with a C-helix peptide up to 15 min after co-culture of the effector and target cells. In the final steps of the fusion event, co-operation of adjoining trimer subunits facilitates surmounting of the barrier to the formation of stable, enlarged pores. Because clustering of trimers is likely to be favoured by low pH (Figure 2) , the final process is irreversible and kinetically controlled [40] ; this means that the last step proceeds under both neutral and acidic conditions, although faster at low pH.",

The lack of significant dequenching for the latter inactive peptide throughout the pH variation in contrast with the wild-type FP shows that the lipid coalescence is induced by ordered alignment of FP molecules on the membrane surface, but not membrane deformation caused by non-specific peptide contact. The arrest of lipid mixing, as manifested by the ceasing of the increase in dequenching at pH 7.1 in the pH cycle, suggests that hemifusion is not an irreversible process. ----, Lipid mixing triggered by HA2(1-25) under a constant pH of 5.0.Lipid mixing assayed by dequenching of Rho-PE showed the process is pH-arrestableFigure 3displays dequenching of the Rho-PE that is incorporated with the DMPC vesicle measured in a pH cycle (5 \u2192 7 \u2192 5).
