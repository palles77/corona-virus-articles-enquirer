However, no T. gondii specific HLA-B07 restricted peptides were proven protective against T gondii. Recently, two T gondii-specific HLA-B*0702-restricted T cell epitopes, GRA7 20-28 (LPQFATAAT) and GRA3 27-35 (VPFVVFLVA), displayed highaffinity binding to HLA-B*0702, and elicited IFN-\u03b3 from PBMCs of seropositive HLA-B*0702 persons. Herein, these peptides were evaluated to determine whether they could elicit IFN-\u03b3 in splenocytes of HLA-B*0702 transgenic mice when administered with adjuvants and protect against subsequent challenge. Peptide-specific IFN-\u03b3 producing T cells were identified by ELISPOT and proliferation assays utilizing splenic T lymphocytes from HLA transgenic mice.",

Our earlier work had definitively proven that L d was essential for restriction of cyst number and brain pathology in L d mice. Our recent study also demonstrated that immunization of H-2L d mice with the lipopeptide constructed by HF10 and PADRE or HF10 with monophosphoryl lipid A (GLA-SE, #2573) protected Balb/c mice. However, HF10 administered to HLA-B07 transgenic mice in a similar manner was not immunogenic despite a common L d and B7 peptide binding motif (10) . TheReference:ore, in order to find effective peptides for T. gondii derived HLA-B07 + restricted CD8 + T cells, we utilized bioinformatic algorithms to identify novel, T. gondiiderived, CD8 + T cell epitopes restricted by the HLA-B07 supertypes, which will collectively provide coverage for 30% of the human population worldwide (11, 12) . We screened the amino acid sequences from nine surface and secreted proteins (SAG1, SUSA1, GRA2, GRA3, GRA6, GRA7, ROP2, ROP16, ROP18) of the type II T. gondii strain, ME49, for HLA-B*0702-specific peptide binding scores using bioinformatic analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seropositive and seronegative persons were tested for response to these peptides using IFN-\u03b3 Elispot assay. Strikingly, two T. gondii-specific HLA-B*0702-restricted T cell epitopes, one derived from GRA7 20-28 (LPQFATAAT), the other derived from GRA3 [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] (VPFVVFLVA) both displayed high-affinity binding to HLA-B*0702 and stimulated IFN-\u03b3 production by peripheral blood cells from HLA-B*0702 persons infected with T. gondii, but not seronegative controls (10) .",

After drying, 25\u00b5l of Microscint was added to each well and the filter plate was sealed and counted in a Top Count (Packard Instrument) to determine radioactivity incorporated into DNA. Results are expressed as the stimulation index (SI), calculated as the ratio between the mean counts per minute (cpm) for triplicate stimulated cultures and the mean counts per min for triplicate unstimulated cultures. SI values 2.0-fold greater than the SI of the control groups were considered to be significant.",

To study the ability of \u03b1HLA-B*0702 to block response of CD8 + T cells in the same experiment, blocking \u03b1CD8 T cells and blocking \u03b1HLA-B*0702 were used with the same spleen cells in the same experiment. The data in Fig. 4A ,B shows that blocking CD8 + T cell receptors using \u03b1CD8 + antibody significantly reduced LT9-specific IFN-\u03b3 production and T cell proliferation (P<0.05). (Fig.  1B) Then, to further analyze the association of LT9 presentation by HLA-B*0702, blocking experiments using a monoclonal anti-HLA-B*0702 antibody (BB7.2) was performed. Results indicated that the IFN-\u03b3 secretion was significantly decreased by the anti-HLA-B07 antibody but not by the control antibody (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4C) . These results demonstrate that the peptide specific IFN-\u03b3 response is HLA-B*0702 restricted and involves CD8 + T cells. The partial blocking by the HLA B7 antibody is likely a function of the antibody's capacity for blocking, and not reactivity of the peptide with the murine H2 haplotypes. This is because the algorithms predict poor affinity of all of the background Balb/c and B6 H2 molecules with these peptides.

However, although peptide VPFVVFLVA was recognized by T cells from Toxoplasma gondii-specific HLA-B07-restricted human PBMC, it did not induce a significant IFN-\u03b3 response in HLA-B*0702 transgenic mice. We therefore concluded that VA9 was presented by HLA-B07 supertype molecules to CD8 + T cells in humans, but was not present in significant quantity to be presented by HLA-B07 supertype molecules to CD8 + T cells in the transgenic mice. We speculate that this seems most likely to be due to the relative insolubility of the VA9 peptide although other differences in formulation could also explain this result. The VA9 peptide was 90% insoluble with overall percent solubilities of 10% in PBS. In contrast, LT9 was soluble, with 99% solubility in PBS. LT9 was effective in the peptide vaccine construct, but VA 9 was not, reduce solubility of peptides in the vaccine peptides might correlate with reduced immunogenicity.",

The PADRE epitope was demonstrated to deliver help for a MHC Class I restricted peptide-specific CTL response to the T. gondii peptide herein. Requirement for CD4 + T cell help in the generation of a CD8 + T cell response also has been proved in viral, bacterial, and parasite models (30, 31) . In studies of Trypanosoma cruzi infections (32) , it was demonstrated that CD4 + T cell help is required during the primary response to immunodominant epitopes.

These observations have led to investigations to co-administer additives known as adjuvants with vaccine antigens to potentiate activity of vaccines and the weak immunogenicity of the synthetic epitopes (33, 34) . Adjuvanting antigens contribute to the success of vaccination. For example, 3-deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA, #2573) a detoxified derivative of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella minesota R595 is a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist and thus a potent activator of Th1 responses (35) (36) (37) . It has been used as an adjuvant in human vaccine trials for several infectious diseases and cancer (38) . It has been very effective as an adjuvant providing CD4 + T cell help for immunizations against other protozoan infections such as leishmaniasis (39) . In our study, a robust response was observed when GLA-SE was included in preparation for immunization of mice. Pam 2 Cys (S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl]cysteine) is a lipid component of macrophage-activating lipopeptide. Pam 2 Cys binds to and activates dendritic cells by engagement of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) (40, 41) . Toll-like receptors (TLRs) function as pattern-recognition receptors in mammals (42) . It is suggested that both TLR2 and TLR4 receptors might participate in the host defense against T. gondii infection through their activation by the GPIs and could work together with other MyD88-dependent receptors, like other TLRs, to obtain an effective host response against T. gondii infection (43) . In our study, an even more robust response was observed in the Pam 2 Cys coadministration group and robust protection was achieved in the transgenic mice challenged with Type II parasites following immunizations. The background of these HLA-B07 mice is a multigeneration back-cross of C57BL/6J mice and BalbK mice (11) . There are no comparable mice without this transgene.",

This peptide vaccine reduced parasite burden in immunized mice challenged with type II parasites. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a T. gondii specific HLA-B07 restricted CD8 + T cell epitope based vaccine that protects HLA-B07 transgenic mice against T. gondii. These findings facilitate development of an immunosense(i.e., based on a bioinformatics, followed by empiric testing approach based on HLA binding,effects with human cells in vitro and testing in HLA transgenic mice [44] ) epitope-based vaccine for human use.",

Immunization was given three times at two week intervals. 11.5 +/\u2212 0.5 days after the last immunization, spleen cells were obtained from immunized mice and stimulated by the specified peptide in an ex vivo IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay. This experiment was performed 3 (4) times. (B) HLA-B*0702 mice immunized with peptide pools and tested for recall responses with LT9 or VA9 or PADRE. HLA-B*0702 transgenic mice immunized with mixtures of two identified peptides (LT9 and VA9), PADRE or Pam 2 Cys mixed with GLA-SE, three times at two week intervals. Fourteen days after the last immunization, spleens were removed from immunized mice and splenocytes were cultured with peptides, LT9 or VA9 or PADRE. The results are expressed as IFN-\u03b3 spot formation by one million cells. Data presented are a representative example from three independent experiments. (C) IFN-\u03b3 spot formation was significantly reduced in the presence of anti-CD8 antibody. Splenocytes from immunized mice were incubated with antibodies to CD8, and their isotype control for 60-90 min prior to stimulation with LT9 or VA9. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01. IFN-\u03b3 spot formation was tested for splenocytes from mice that received different vaccine formulations in the absence or presence of blocking antibody.

Splenocytes were isolated from peptide-immunized HLA-B07 transgenic mice 10 days after immunization and incubated with antibodies to CD8\u03b1 or HLA-B07 and their common isotype control for 60-90 min prior to stimulation with LT9.

Xenogen imaging of brain ex vivo following the injection of luciferin intraperitoneally and then exposure of the brain to luciferin solution Twenty one days earlier mice had been challenged with 20,000 FLUC Prugneaud parasites. They did not appear ill when they received three doses of GLA-SE-PADRE-LT9. However, when they received three doses of PBS or three doses of GLA-SE-PADRE they appeared ill 8 days after challenge. There were 5 mice per treatment group. FLUC challenge followed immunization by 2 weeks. Neither GLA-SE-PADRE nor PBS elicited splenocytes that produced IFN-\u03b3 when re-stimulated with LT9 whereas GLA-SE-PADRE-LT9 immunization did (data not shown). This was also shown in other HLA transgenic mouse strains (Table  S2) . Neither PBS nor GLA-SE-PADRE led to decrease in luciferease detetion but GLA-SE-PADRE-LT9 did.
