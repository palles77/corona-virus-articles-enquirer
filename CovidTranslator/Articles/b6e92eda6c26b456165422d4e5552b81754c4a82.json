This emphasises the importance of 26 current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing 27 outbreak will not become a large global epidemic. Here, we present data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 52 patients from the current outbreak, obtained from publicly available line lists [11] . We fit 53 an exponential distribution to these data, accounting for uncertainty due to the limited 54 numbers of patients from whom data were available. Assuming that this distribution 55 characterises the time spent by infected hosts generating new transmissions in the 56 community, it is then possible to infer the probability that a case arriving in a new location 57 is followed by an outbreak driven by sustained human-to-human transmission. We 58 estimate this probability under the assumption that the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV 59 is similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, and then go on to consider the effect of The distribution of times from symptom onset to hospitalisation was estimated using 69 patient data from the ongoing outbreak [11] (data are shown in Fig 1A) .

For example, for a case showing symptoms on 9 January 2020, and then 73 being hospitalised on 14 January 2020, the time between symptom onset and 74 hospitalisation lies between four and six days (see e.g. [12] for a similar calculation). 75",

We found that, if surveillance is 134 intensified so that the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation is halved, the 135 probability that each imported case leads to sustained transmission is reduced to only 136 0.005 (Fig 1D) .

Since then, cases have been recorded in other countries, and initial 38 estimates suggest a case fatality rate of around 14% [6]. Even countries without 39 confirmed cases are on high alert. For example, the United Kingdom has not yet seen a 40 confirmed case, but officials are reported to be attempting to trace as many as 2,000 41 visitors that have travelled to that country from Wuhan. 42 43 The most devastating infectious disease outbreaks are those that have a wide 44 geographical distribution, as opposed to being confined to a small region [7,8]. The 45 previously known virus that is most similar to the 2019-nCoV is the SARS coronavirus [9], 46 which generated cases in 37 countries in 2002-03 [9,10]. Since the 2019-nCoV is clearly 47",

We made the assumption that symptom appearance 187 coincides with the onset of infectiousness. One of the features of the SARS outbreak in188 2002-03 that allowed it to eventually be brought under control was the low proportion of 189 onward transmissions occurring either prior to symptoms or from asymptomatic infectious 190 hosts [21].

One example 202 might be to consider spatial variation in host population densities and surveillance levels, 203 leading to spatially inhomogeneous outbreak risks. It would also be possible to 204 differentiate between mild and severe cases in the model. On the one hand, a mild case 205 might be more likely to go unnoticed than a severe case, potentially leading to a higher206 outbreak risk. On the other hand, mild infections may generate fewer secondary cases 207 than severe infections, thereby decreasing the outbreak risk. Complex interactions may 208 therefore affect the risk of sustained transmission in an unpredictable fashion. 209 210 Despite the necessary simplifications made in this study, our analyses are sufficient to 211 demonstrate the key principle that rigorous surveillance is important to minimise the risk 212 of the 2019-nCoV generating large outbreaks in countries worldwide.
