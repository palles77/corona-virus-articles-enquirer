Although Ab present in 2 colostrum enter the circulation, the protection against this enteric disease is primarily 3 dependent on the presence of RVA-specific Ab in the calves' intestinal lumen, indicating 4 that protection could be achieved by the presence of passive Ab in the gut lumen 5 combined with a rapid active antibody secreting cell (ASC) response in the intestinal 6 lamina propria (Saif and Fernandez, 1996; Fernandez et al., 1998). Regarding passive 7 immune protection, calves receiving pooled colostrum from vaccinated dams prior to gut 8 closure (within 4 hours after birth) were protected against severe diarrhea (Fernandez et 9 al., 1998; Parre\u00f1o et al., 2004). However, RVA-specific Ab from colostrum decline after 10 calving and seem to be insufficient against high challenge doses of virus (Parre\u00f1o et al., 11 2004). On the other hand, supplementation of the milk diet with immune colostrum 12 significantly reduced diarrhea and delayed viral shedding onset (Kohara and 13 Tsunemitsu, 2000; Parre\u00f1o et al., 2010).

In agreement, bovine RVA infectious 12 viral particles were detected in feces from all animals by the same day that diarrhea 13 appeared. Results for diarrhea and virus shedding are detailed in Figure 1. Following 14 the experimental design, calves assigned to G1 received RVA IgY Ab treatment within 2 15 hours since the development of diarrhea and for seven consecutive days. Diarrhea in 16 this group terminated an average of 3.2 days after the beginning of the passive 17 treatment (range 2 to 5 days). This duration was significantly shorter than the ones 18 registered for CD calves (10.4 days, G3) while animals fed colostrum followed by RVA 19 Ab free milk (G2) developed RVA-associated diarrhea of an intermediate duration 20 (average 7.6 days). Interestingly, virus shedding duration was significantly shorter in 21 calves in G1 (average 4.5 days) than in animals in G2 (average 11.6 days), while calves 22 in G3 showed an intermediate duration of 6 days in average. However, the areas under 23 the curve of virus shedding (AUC) were not significantly different between the groups of calves. Severity of RVA-associated diarrhea, considered as the 1 average AUC of diarrhea score for each group of calves, was also significantly lower in 2 RVA IgY Ab treated calves (G1) than in either of the other groups of animals (G2 and 3 G3). Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the number of days with RVA-4 associated hyperthermia for calves in G1 (2.5 days in average) compared with animals 5 in control groups (G2: 12 days and G3: 11.4 days). It is important to mention that 6 animals receiving passive RVA-specific IgY Ab treatment (G1) did not show other 7 clinical signs of bovine RVA infection like anorexia, dehydration or depression (personal 8 observation, data not shown), while they were evident in all calves in G2 and specially in 9 G3.10All the calves in G1 cleared the viral infection while they were under passive treatment11 with IgY Abs and infectious virus was not detected during the experiment(Figure 1a). As 12 shown, IgY Abs to Indiana RVA strain from the passive treatment were detected by13 ELISA in feces from calves in G1(Figure 1a). The ELISA IgY Ab titers to RVA varied14 daily and could be associated with the viral replication and shedding, especially because 15 there was an increase in the titers observed once RVA-infection was cleared, around16    PID 9-10.

Although normally newborn calves would receive at least one 3 liter of colostrum from their mothers, many of them fail to stand in the first hours of life 4 and nurse soon enough before gut closure. These calves are frequently found in dairy 5 herds from Argentina and their survival is compromised by the lack of passively 6 transferred maternal immune factors and antibodies (Tripathi and Vashishtha, 2006; 7 Osaka et al., 2014). The results obtained demonstrate that daily oral administration of 8 egg yolk powder enriched in IgY Ab to bovine RVA at a final ELISA Ab titer of 4096 (VN 9 titer: 2048, to Indiana RVA strain, genotype G6P[5]) significantly reduced the number of 10 days with diarrhea and hyperthermia as well as the severity of the illness when 11compared with colostrum deprived calves that did not receive any virus-specific 12 treatment.13 Regarding virus shedding, calves treated with IgY Abs to bovine RVA cleared virus14 infection before the end of the passive treatment and significantly earlier than control 15 animals receiving colostrum but without IgY Ab treatment (G2). Also, heterologous IgY16 Abs were detected by ELISA in feces, suggesting that they were not completely 17 degraded in the intestinal tract. The resistance of IgY Abs to the calf\u00b4s gut environment 18 was also previously observed by our group in the administration of fluid crude egg yolk 19 as a passive prophylactic treatment to prevent RVA-associated diarrhea in newborn 20 calves (Vega et al., 2011). 21 Another important novel feature observed in this study is the induction of a stronger 22 RVA-specific ASC response in calves receiving milk supplemented with chicken egg 23 yolk powder than in control animals receiving colostrum (G2) or CD calves (G3) fed RVA Ab free milk. This feature was previously observed in calves fed milk supplemented with 1 crude egg yolk administered as a preventive strategy for a longer period of time (Vega 2 et al., 2011). These results together demonstrate that this immunomodulatory activity is 3 local, affecting only GALT ASC responses. In the current experiment, calves were fed 4 egg yolk powder for only 7 days, half of the time compared to previous prophylactic 5 experiments. Yet, the modulatory effect of egg yolk supplementation was clearly 6 maintained. These high numbers of bovine RVA-specific ASC detected in the GALT of 7 egg yolk treated animals represent a powerful active immune strategy to control bovine 8 RVA diarrhea as well as potentially other enteric infections. These results are in 9 agreement with the presence of immunomodulatory molecules in the egg yolk, that 10 promote B cell clonal expansion and IgA switching related to anti-inflammatory 11 responses to dietary antigens(Nelson et al., 2007). It has been previously demonstrated 12 that this immunomodulatory effect of egg yolk is not related to IgY Abs itself, as calves13 treated with semi-purified IgY Abs for 14 days as well as gnotobiotic pigs fed milk14 supplemented with semi-purified IgY Abs for 9 days did not develop statistically higher 15 ASC responses in GALT than control groups(Vega et al., 2012).

We also shortened the our group (Parre\u00f1o et al., 2010; Vega et al., 2011). However, even with 2 only 7 days of twice daily continuous treatment, IgY Abs were a strong and versatile 3 immune strategy against bovine RVA-associated diarrhea. Another important feature is 4 the fact that the passive treatment administered to calves in this experiment consisted 5 mainly of egg yolk powder, which can be easily manipulated and kept at room 6 temperature for long periods of time (even until 12-16 months). These properties 7 emphasize the advantages of egg yolk as a source of specific antibodies. Avian Ab 8 represent both a reduction and refinement in animal use (Karlsson et al., 2004). When 9 considering Ab production for passive immunotherapy applications, chickens present a 10 much more economical source of large quantities of specific Ab being also less invasive 11 as it only requires daily collection of eggs (Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002; Karlsson et 12 al., 2004; Schade et al., 2005; Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2012).

All animals in G1 and G2 had a circulating ELISA mean IgG1 Ab titer to Indiana bovine RVA strain of ~1024/4096 in serum after colostrum intake. Calves in G3 did not receive colostrum but 1 L of RVA Ab free milk at this time point, remaining seronegative to bovine RVA, as expected. The this group were fed milk without supplemental Abs. Calves in G2 and G3 were fed commercial RVA Ab free milk during the experiment. All the calves were euthanized at PID 21 to study the primary Ab responses to bovine RVA infection. Clinical observations and sample collection: Calves were examined daily for the 12 development of diarrhea and virus shedding after virulent bovine RVA inoculation. Rectal temperatures were measured during the experiment and values over 39\u00baC were considered as hyperthermia. To estimate the severity of the diarrhea, fecal consistency liquid; considering a score equal or greater than 2 as diarrhea (Parre\u00f1o et al., 2010).The area under the fecal scores curve (AUC) for each calf was determined and then the average AUC for diarrhea was calculated for each group. Prior and after virulent bovine RVA inoculation, fecal samples were collected daily to assess virus shedding. Serum",
