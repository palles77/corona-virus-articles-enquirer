Although serological surveys show that BVDV exposure is widespread in cattle in Uruguay, BVDV-associated diseases are greatly underreported. The aim of this work is to describe the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, and virological findings from spontaneous outbreaks of BVDV-associated diseases in cattle in Uruguay. Diagnostic investigations were performed during 6 spontaneous disease outbreaks on beef and dairy cattle farms in the departments of Colonia, Rio Negro, and Soriano between November 2016 and April 2018. Carcasses of 8 naturally deceased cattle from these outbreaks were necropsied and subjected to histological examination and immunohistochemistry to detect BVDV antigen in the tissues. Reverse transcription real-time PCR and genomic sequencing were also performed to identify BVDV at the species and subtype levels. Other ancillary diagnostic tests, including bacterial cultures, were performed on a case-by-case basis to rule in/out differential diagnoses based on initial clinicopathological presumptive diagnoses. BVDV-associated conditions that were diagnosed in the 8 cases included mucosal disease, transient postnatal BVDV infections associated with digestive/septicemic salmonellosis by Salmonella serovar typhimurium, Histophilus somni bronchopneumonia, urinary tract coinfections with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus sp., enteric coinfection with coccidia, and transplacental fetal infections and abortions with Neospora caninum coinfection. BVDV-1a and BVDV-2b were each identified in four of the eight cases. We conclude that BVDV-1a and BVDV-2b contribute significantly to disease and mortality in cattle in Uruguay. Future research should estimate the economic impact of BVDV in the Uruguayan livestock sector.",

BVDV causes significant economic losses to the dairy and beef livestock industries, which are attributed to morbidity, mortality, growth retardation, reduced milk production, premature culling, reduced reproductive performance, and increased occurrences of other diseases [2, 3] . The two currently recognized BVDV species are BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, and they were recently renamed Pestivirus A and B, respectively [4, 5] . BVDV-1 is the most genetically diverse, with 21 subtypes (BVDV-1a through u) currently recognized, while 4 subtypes (a-d) have been described for BVDV-2 [6] [7] [8] [9] . More recently, the Pestivirus HoBi-like virus has been proposed as a new BVDV species (BVDV-3 or Pestivirus H) based on antigenic and genetic similarities [4, 5, 10, 11] .",

A FFPE section of archived intestine from a naturally infected calf that tested positive for BVDV by RT-PCR and IHC was used as a positive control.

PI cattle are viremic, lifelong viral shedders, and immunotolerant to the NCP strain with which they are infected because their immune systems do not recognize the BVDV antigens as foreign, thus leading to extensive viral replication in the target cells [13, 27] . In our case, viremia was confirmed by identifying BVDV-1a in the serum, while IHC allowed detecting abundant viral antigen in the alimentary tract tissues (esophagus, small, and large intestines), which showed typical MD lesions. MD occurs in PI animals when the NCP BVDV strain is converted to the cytopathic biotype via mutation, recombination, and/or genomic rearrangements. Generally, the NS2/3 viral protease containing the NCP strain is cleaved to NS2 and NS3 in the cytopathic strains [12, 28] . This results in a devastating infection that destroys the host cells, to which the animal's immune system cannot respond [13] .",

However, coinfections with BVDV-1a (case 2) and BVDV-2b (case 8) were identified by RT-qPCR/ sequencing, indicating a congenital/transplacental circulation and transmission of both viral species/subtypes in these fetuses.

In contrast, in our fetuses (cases 2, 7, and 8), the virus was undetected by IHC, although it was identified by RT-qPCR, suggesting that the viral load may have been below the IHC detection limit and indirectly suggesting that these fetal infections were transient/acute. The roles of BVDV-1a and BVDV-2b infections as causes of abortions in these cases could not be determined. Interestingly, in a study conducted in dairy cattle, BVDV-induced immunosuppression was hypothesized to contribute to the occurrence of abortions due to N. caninum [31] , although more detailed investigations are needed to confirm the possible synergistic association between these agents [32] .",

Bielefeldt-Ohmann et al. [29] reported that both BVDV-2 and BVDV-1b have a similar tissue tropism, although BVDV-2 passes through the placenta more quickly. Additionally, antigenic immunolabeling in the fetal tissues was more intense for BVDV-2 than for BVDV-1b [29] . In the 3 fetuses evaluated in our study, BVDV immunolabeling was negative in all analyzed tissues, independent of the infecting viral species/subtype. This finding suggests that the fetuses were not PI, but rather were acutely/transiently infected, which may or may not have contributed to abortion due to N. caninum in cases 2 and 8 as discussed previously. When infection occurs in the last third of gestation, the fetal bovine immune system is sufficiently developed to respond to the virus, being comparable with a transient postnatal infection [35, 36] . Serological assays to assess whether these fetuses had developed specific humoral responses to BVDV were not performed in our study. Transient/acute BVDV infections are largely subclinical or cause mild clinical signs, although they can induce leukopenia (lymphopenia, monocytopenia) and reduce antibody production and neutrophil release and function, resulting in immunosuppression. Such immunosuppression favors secondary bacterial and/or viral infections [13] that can contribute to respiratory, digestive, or septicemic diseases [13, 37] . In the three animals from outbreaks 3 and 4 (cases 3-5), BVDV infection likely contributed to the occurrence of pneumonic histophilosis (case 3), enteric/septicemic salmonellosis (case 4), and septicemia or urinary infection by opportunistic pathogens such as Streptococcus sp. and E. coli (case 5). These coinfections were confirmed by isolating the bacterial agents involved in each case, and their pathogenic role was established by evaluating the lesions compatible with those caused by these agents in the respective pathological examinations.",

This is directly related to introducing PI animals that can carry the infection or new viral strains into the herds [38] [39] [40] [41] . In 3 of the outbreaks reported here (outbreaks 3-5), the anamnestic information revealed that cattle from different origins were introduced and mixed into the herds without prior BVDV testing, which possibly contributed to disseminating and spreading infection and disease between farms. Detecting and removing infected cattle from the herds is key in controlling BVDV infections.",

However, in a study conducted in the USA, both BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 were diagnosed in cattle with clinical respiratory and digestive manifestations, as well as in necropsied cattle [42] , with BVDV-1 being the most common species [42, 43] . BVDV-1a (cases 1, 5, and 6) and BVDV-2b (cases 3 and 4) were identified in heifers/steers in our work, indicating that both species are related to postnatal morbidity and mortality in cattle in Uruguay. In other South American countries, clinical disease has been reported for BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b, BVDV-2a, and BVDV-2b in Argentina [44] [45] [46] ; BVDV-1b, BVDV-1d, BVDV-1i, and BVDV-2b in Brazil [47] [48] [49] [50] ; and BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b, and BVDV-1c in Chile and Peru [17, 51] . Although cattle exposed to BVDV in utero constitute a significant portion of clinical presentations, cases of transient/acute postnatal infection may be significant sources of direct losses [1] . Several of the deaths reported in outbreaks 3 and 4 (cases 3-5) were likely due to transient/acute BVDV infections aggravated by secondary bacterial infections. The arteriolitis observed in case 3 is a lesion frequently found in BVDV cases [13] , whereas it is not a typical finding in salmonellosis [52] , the agent with which this calf was coinfected. This case presented typical lesions of both agents, and although Salmonella typhimurium can cause disease and death by itself, it also behaves as an opportunistic pathogen, and thus, in this case, the BVDV may have predisposed to clinical salmonellosis. Additional evidence of transient/acute infection in these cases included detection of intralesional BVDV antigens by IHC in only some of the calf tissues examined by this technique.",

Even with a high viral circulation in the country's cattle population, only 3% of farmers implement preventive vaccinations [22] . More recently, active BVDV infections in cattle in Uruguay were explored in a study in which 390 serum samples from 14 herds were analyzed to search for viral antigens by capture ELISA and for viral genomes by RT-qPCR. Sixteen (4.1%) of these animals were positive by both techniques [18] , suggesting that they were either PI animals and/or acute/transient infections acquired postnatally. Interestingly, the mortality rate was 3.5% in the herd with MD from outbreak 1 in our study, suggesting, hypothetically, that 3.5% of this herd could have been PI animals, a value close to that found by Maya et al. [18] . Although the prevalence of PI animals in a herd is generally < 2%, it can be as high as 25-30% in herds where many cows/heifers were exposed to NCP BVDV strains during early pregnancy [13] .",

Recent investigations in Argentina have led to developing an enhanced BVDV subunit vaccine expressed in a baculovirus, based on a truncated E2 glycoprotein fused to a single-chain antibody that targets antigenpresenting cells [58] . This vaccine's immunogenicity was tested in guinea pigs and cattle, and immunized cattle developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against BVDV up to 1 year after immunization. Based on these results, the vaccine was scaled up and registered and is being commercialized as the first Argentinean subunit vaccine for cattle [59] . Whether these vaccines protect against Uruguayan BVDV strains remains to be addressed.",

Costbenefit analyses and feasibility studies could help establish preventive and control programs for BVDV at the farm, regional, and national levels.",
