The sequence data indicate that segment 1 contains 3302 bp and is A+T rich (65.3%). The positive strand of segment 1 contains a single open reading frame that extends 1088 codons and possesses 5'-and 3'terminal untranslated regions of 18 and 20 bp, respectively. The first AUG conforms to the Kozak consensus sequence and if utilized, would yield a protein having a calculated molecular weight of 124,847, very close to the apparent molecular weight of VP1 (M.W. 125,000). The deduced amino acid sequence presents significant similarities with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of several RNA viruses. VP1 was also synthesized in baculovirus using two transfer vecors: pAC461 and pVL941. Following infection of Sf9 cells with a recombinant baculovirus, a full-length nonfusion protein was synthesised which shares properties with authentic VP1 made in monkey kidney cells. The level of VP1 synthesis was about 1 O-fold higher when the baculovirus recombinant was derived from the pVL941 transfer vector. In that case, VP1 was expressed in yields approximately equivalent to 10% of the cellular protein. The recombinant protein was immunoprecipitated by hyperimmune serum raised against purified rotavirus. It also was immunogenic; a hyperimmune serum made in guinea pigs reacted with VP1 using immunoprecipitation and Western blot. This serum did not possess neutralization activity.",

Nucleotide sequences have been reported (for one or another rotavirus strain) for the RNA segments 4 to 11 (Both et al., 1982 (Both et al., , 1983a (Both et al., ,b, 1984 lmai eta/., 1983; Estes et a/., 1984; Kantharidis et al., 1987; Bremont et a/., 1987) .

Three polypeptides are associated with cores (Liu et al., 1988) . VP2 is the major component of cores and has been shown to bind RNA (Boyle and Holmes, 1986) . VP1 represents only 2% of the viral protein moiety of the complete virion and probably does not act as a scaffolding protein. As a minor component of single-shelled particles, VP1 could function as pat-t of the transcriptase present in activated particles. VP1 with VP2, VP6, and two nonstructural proteins is also a component of subviral particles containing replicase activity (Patton and Gallegos, 1988) . Temperature-sensitive mutants which map to genome segment 1 have RNA-negative phenotypes (Gombold and Ramig, 1987) . These observations support a putative enzymatic role for VPl.",

All three recombinants derived from the transfer vector pAC461 expressed equal amounts of VP1 The same observation was obtained with recombinant derived from pVL941. Consequently only pAC461/RFl .l and pVL941/RFl. 1 were used for the subsequent studies. VP1 synthesis in Sf9 cells infected with these two recombinant viruses was compared with that of the proteins of wild-type baculovirus (Fig. 4A) . The polyhedrin was absent in recombinant virus-infected cells, and a new band of the expected molecular weight (125,000) was easily identified at 24 hr postinfection. This band migrated the same as the in vitro translation product of gene 1 mRNA (data not shown). The kinetics of VP1 expression obtained with each of the recombinant viruses were similar with a peak of synthesis between 36 and 48 hr followed by a gradual decline until 72 hr postinfection. The level of VP1 synthesis by pVL941derived recombinant was 5 to 10 times greater than from viruses derived from pAC461. Analysis of the stained gels infected with pVL941/RFl .l recombinant indicated that rotavirus VP1 represent about 10% of the cell proteins and 20% of the amount of the polyhedrin found in Sf9 cells infected with wild-type virus (Fig.  4B) . Comparison of the amount of pulse-labeled protein with the total amount of protein in stained gels showed that of VP1 in Sf9 ceils was not degraded as the intensity of the 125K band constantly increased until 3 days postinfection whereas the rate of synthesis decreased after 48 hr. lmmunoreactivity and localization of recombinant VP1",

An antiserum to gene 1 recombinant-infected Sf9 cells was shown to recognize VP1 in rotavirus-infected Ma1 04 cell lysate by immunoprecipitation or Western blot. VP1 was not excreted into the supernatant of recombinant virus-infected cells and only 10% of the protein was soluble in RIPA buffer (data not shown).

Examination of thin sections at various times postinfection failed to detect specific inclusions in recombinant virus infected cells.

In three places there is an accumulation of basic residues (87-96; 159-l 66; 451-460), similar to short stretches of basic residues found in histones. The deduced amino acid of VP1 was also analyzed to determine predicted hydropholic and hydrophobic domains. Although the N-terminal region is hydrophobic and the first 18 amino acids could correspond to a signal peptide (polar residue at position 3 and 9 hydrophobic residues in the 18 first residues) according to Perlman and Halvorson (1983) . However, these predictions are not supported by evaluation of the translocation of rotavirus proteins made in cell-free systems in the presence of microsomal membranes (Ericson et al., 1983) . Although there are nine potential N-type carbohydrate attachment sites there is also no direct evidence that this gene product is glycosylated. The deduced amino acid sequence yields limited information on the secondary structure of the protein. Using the rules proposed by Garnier et al. (1978) most of the a-helical regions were found to be confined to the amino-terminal half of the molecule. An examination of the carboxy-terminal region revealed the presence of 8 Ser-Lys or Lys-Ser di-amino acids which have been described as favored phosphorylation sites.",

One region, between amino acids 517 and 636, presents a statistically significant homology with consensus sequences that have been established for a number of conserved regions in putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) from several RNA viruses of eukaryotes by comparison to the known poliovirus polymerase (Pietras et al., 1988). The amino acid sequence Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) is present in this region. This sequence is thought to be characteristic of RdRp (Kamer and Argos, 1984) . Moreover two regions upstream of the GDD sequence bear a close resemblance to the published alignment (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1988) . The matches present in these three elements are shown in Fig. 6 . A fourth consensus sequence usually found 30-50 residues downstream of the thrid element is not present in the VP1 sequence. It should be noted that similar sequences have been found in infectious bursal disease virus whose genome consists also of doublestranded RNA (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1988; Dobos et al., 1979) .",

The sequence data presented here favor this hypothesis and the production of viral proteins in high yield from the baculovirus system offers a new way to analyze the enzymatic role of VP1 by using the monospecific anti-VP1 antiserum either to inhibit transcriptase activity or to test the poly-merase activity of the recombinant protein. Experiments to test these hypotheses are in progress.",

We thank Peggy Janus and Sue Crawford for technical assistance and A.M. Spite for excellent secretarial help. We also thank Dr. Max Summers and Verne Lockow for providing us with the pVL941 vector.Note added in proof. Since submission of the manuscript sequences of reovirus X3 and bluetongue virus P have been published. In both sequences a motive similar to the putative polymerase site ( fig. 6 ) could be identified between positions 666-769 and 585-739 respectively for the bluetongue and the reovirus.",
