The incidence of required reintubation ranges from 6% to 20%, and it depends on the clinical mix of patients, 15, 17, 18 their critical acuity, critical care resources, and the threshold levels for extubation. Even if reintubation is successful, patients who failed their initial extubation had increased rates of ICU mortality and cost of care, prolonged ICU stay, and hospital length of stay. 19 Compared with routine postoperative patients, intensive care patients are more likely to fail extubation because neurologic obtundation may leave them unable to protect their airways. Debilitation and impaired mucociliary clearance may interfere with pulmonary toilet, and diminished strength, altered pulmonary mechanics, increased dead space, and venous admixture may result in hypercapnic or hypoxemic respiratory failure.",

Studies involving a wide case mix of postoperative patients show a high degree of concordance regarding the incidence of required reintubation. Combining the results of four large studies enrolling more than 150,000 patients, the incidence ranged from 0.09% to 0.19%. [20] [21] [22] [23] The reintubation rate appears to be significantly higher (1% to 3%) after selected surgical procedures such as panendoscopy 20 and a variety of head and neck procedures. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Postoperative reintubation, although uncommon, may offer some unexpected challenges, including anatomic distortion, physiologic instability, incomplete information concerning the patient, lack of essential equipment and time, and inexperienced personnel. These problems may convert a previously easily managed airway into a life-threatening disaster. A difficult airway adequately managed during a controlled intubation is completely different from the difficult airway in an agitated, hypoxemic, and hypotensive patient.",

Textbooks, reviews, and conferences focusing on the airway frequently ignore this aspect of management, despite the observation that airway complications are significantly more likely to be associated with extubation than intubation. 1 These complications range from the relatively minor, such as coughing and transient breath holding that have little impact on outcome, to those that are life-threatening. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Closed Claims Project analyzed adverse respiratory events and found that 17% of brain injuries and deaths occurred after extubation in the operating room or postanesthesia care unit (PACU). 2 Complications associated with extubation in critical care areas are likely to occur more frequently and have more serious consequences. 3, 4 The ASA Task Force on Management of the Difficult Airway and the Canadian Airway Focus Group recommended a preformulated strategy for extubation of the difficult airway and an airway management plan for dealing with post-extubation hypoventilation. 5, 6 This chapter classifies the complications associated with routine and more complex tracheal extubation or reintubation, proposes a risk stratification for extubation and reintubation in various clinical settings, and suggests strategies that may prove helpful in reducing serious complications or death.",

[13] [14] [15] [16] To minimize the risks, discomfort, and expense of prolonged intubation, a trial of extubation is occasionally the PACU. The highest proportion was attributed to inadequate ventilation, and many of these patients died or suffered brain damage. 31 Many clinical conditions may give rise to postoperative ventilatory failure. A multicenter, prospective survey in France that looked at almost 200,000 general anesthetics administered between 1978 and 1982 found that postoperative respiratory depression accounted for 27 of 85 respiratory complications that were life-threatening or had serious sequelae. These complications were responsible for seven deaths and five cases of hypoxic encephalopathy. 32 A respiratory rate of less than 8 breaths/min was observed by PACU nurses among 0.2% of 24,000 patients after general anesthesia. 22 Hypoventilation may be mediated centrally at the level of the upper motor neuron, anterior horn cell, lower motor neuron, neuromuscular junction, or respiratory muscles. Clinical correlates include central sleep apnea, carotid endarterectomy, 33 medullary injuries, demyelinating disorders, direct injury to peripheral nerves, poliomyelitis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, motor neuron disease, myasthenia gravis, and botulism. Hypoventilation may result from the loss of lung or pleural elasticity, diaphragmatic splinting caused by abdominal pain or distention, thoracic deformities such as kyphoscoliosis, or multifactorial entities such as morbid obesity and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Rarely, hypercapnia results from excess carbon dioxide production or a marked increase in physiologic dead space.",

These events are more likely in some clinical situations because of preexisting medical conditions or anesthetic and surgical interventions. If sufficiently severe, there may be a requirement for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or reintubation and mechanical ventilation. 3 . Inability to Protect the Airway ICU or postoperative patients may be unable to protect the airway because of preexisting obtundation, neurologic injury, or the effects of residual anesthesia. In the latter case, it may be possible to temporize by turning patients on their sides, altering their positions (head up or head down) or by reversing residual medications with antagonists. These measures may not restore airway competency, and lack of resolution may necessitate reintubation.",

The most common respiratory causes were hypercapnic or hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency (60%), respiratory obstruction (20.5%), and laryngospasm or bronchospasm (19.5%). Failed extubations from a respiratory cause occurred at a rate of 112/107,301 or 0.1%. Unintended extubation accounted for 25 of 191 reintubations, all of which occurred in the operating room. Surgical complications, including neck hematoma, pneumothorax, laryngeal nerve paralysis, and bleeding, accounted for 16 of 191 reintubations. Contrary to their expectations, the investigators found that excessive narcotics (9 cases) and prolonged neuromuscular blockade with pancuronium (2 cases) were responsible for only 11 of 191 reintubations. This self-reported information was retrospective, and sometimes required interpretation of the causes from the therapies applied (e.g., narcotic antagonists, additional doses of anticholinergics).",

[89] [90] [91] Anatomic or functional laryngeal problems are more likely to develop as a consequence of a difficult or prolonged intubation attempts. 22 Possible airway injuries include laryngeal edema, laceration, hematoma, granuloma formation, vocal fold immobility, and dislocation of the arytenoid cartilages. 92 Glottic edema has been classified as supraglottic, retroarytenoidal, and subglottic. 93 Supraglottic edema may result in posterior displacement of the epiglottis, reducing the laryngeal inlet and causing inspiratory obstruction. Retroarytenoidal edema restricts movement of the arytenoid cartilages, limiting vocal cord abduction on inspiration. Subglottic edema, a particular problem in neonates and infants, results in swelling of the loose submucosal connective tissue that is confined by the nonexpandable cricoid cartilage. In neonates and small children, this is the narrowest part of the upper airway, and small reductions in diameter result in a significant increase in airway resistance. In children, laryngeal edema is promoted by a tight-fitting ETT, traumatic intubation, intubation longer than 1 hour, coughing on the tracheal tube, and intraoperative alterations of head position. 94 Koka and coworkers found an incidence of 1% among children younger than 17 years. Laryngeal edema should be suspected when inspiratory stridor develops within 6 hours of extubation. Management of laryngeal edema depends on its severity. Treatment options include head-up positioning, supplemental humidified oxygen, racemic epinephrine, helium-oxygen administration, reintubation, and tracheostomy.",

[95] [96] [97] [98] In the setting of adult ICUs, a large, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of methylprednisolone (20 mg administered 12 hours before and every 4 hours until extubation) versus placebo found that steroids significantly reduced post-extubation laryngeal edema (11 of 355 versus 76 of 343, P < 0.0001) and required reintubation due to laryngeal edema (8% versus 54%, P = 0.005). Laryngeal edema was defined by any two of stridor, inspiratory prolongation, and use of a round tube through a triangular opening. The trachea can be lacerated or penetrated by the ETT or its introducer or by ischemic compression by the cuff on the tracheal mucosa. Palatopharyngeal injuries have been described as a consequence of blind insertion of an ETT during video laryngoscopy. [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] Although these injuries are not often apparent at the time of laryngoscopy, they have been managed conservatively and should not complicate extubation. The epiglottis can be downfolded during intubation, but the consequences of downfolding, even if prolonged, are unknown. 128 Laryngeal injuries accounted for 33% of all airway injury claims and 6% of all claims in the ASA Closed Claims Project database. 129 They range from transient hoarseness to vocal fold paralysis. Even when direct laryngoscopy provides a satisfactory glottic view or intubation is facilitated by fiberoptic instrumentation, 89,91 airway injury can occur and go unsuspected until after the ETT is removed. Airway injuries are presumed to be less likely if intubation is easy, but analysis of the ASA Closed Claims Project revealed that 58% of airway trauma and 80% of laryngeal injuries were associated with intubations that were not difficult. 129, 130 Judging from the findings of the Closed Claims Project, difficult intubations were more likely to result in pharyngeal and esophageal than tracheal injuries.",

It may be a consequence of a subluxation or a hemarthrosis with subsequent resolution or fixation. Prolonged or stressful contact between the ETT and the posteromedial aspects of the vocal cords, arytenoids, or posterior commissure may result in ulceration of the perichondrium, which heals with fibrous adhesions that produce an immobile glottis. This complication may be more common than the literature indicates. 92, 141 Persistent post-extubation hoarseness, a breathy voice, and an ineffective cough should prompt assessment by an otolaryngologist.

Differentiation may require palpation of the cricoarytenoid joints under anesthesia or laryngeal electromyography. 88 When vocal fold paralysis occurs as a surgical complication, it is usually associated with neck, thyroid, or thoracic surgery. The left RLN can also be compressed by thoracic tumors, aortic aneurysmal dilatation, left atrial enlargement, or during closure of a patent ductus arteriosus. Occasionally, a surgical cause cannot be implicated.

The cricothyroid muscles are the vocal cord tensors, an action mediated by the SLN. Management of laryngospasm consists of prevention by either extubating at a sufficiently deep plane of anesthesia or awaiting recovery of consciousness. 56 Potential airway irritants should be removed and painful stimulation should be discontinued. If laryngospasm occurs, oxygen by sustained positive pressure may be helpful, although this may push the aryepiglottic folds more tightly together. 109 Larson described a technique of applying firm digital pressure anteriorly directed to the \"laryngospasm notch\" between the ascending mandibular ramus and the mastoid process and observed that this technique is rapid and highly effective. 110 Very small doses of a short-acting neuromuscular blocker with or without reintubation may be necessary. 111, 112 ",

The lip or tongue may become entrapped between the laryngoscope blade and the mandibular teeth, resulting in swelling or bleeding, although this is unlikely to be severe enough to complicate extubation. The glottis may be injured as a result of insertion of A variety of conditions may lead to airway edema severe enough to result in post-extubation stridor. It occurred in 2% to 37% of ICU patients after \"prolonged intubation.\" 150 A test was sought to predict patients with sufficient airway swelling to compromise safe extubation. The cuff-leak test was initially proposed for children with croup. 151 The concept is that marked airway swelling is likely if air does not escape around the deflated ETT cuff when the ETT is occluded as the patient exhales. The cuff-leak test was the best predictor of successful extubation in a pediatric burn and trauma unit, and although sensitive, it was not specific for predicting stridor, necessitating reintubation in 62 adults. 152, 153 The test has been refined by evaluating cuff-leak volume as the difference between inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes during assist-control ventilation after cuff deflation. 41, 154 Two studies found the cuff-leak volume could predict post-extubation stridor. In one study, 8 of 45 patients exhibited stridor, 4 of whom required reintubation. 154 In the other study involving 88 adult medical ICU patients, 6 patients exhibited stridor, 3 of whom required reintubation. 41 They observed a significantly smaller cuff leak in patients who subsequently developed stridor, concluding that this measurement was the best predictor of the presence or absence of stridor. However, a study of 561 consecutive cardiothoracic patients who were extubated within 24 hours (median, 12 hours) defined a the cuff leak as the difference between the inspired and expired tidal volumes during assist-controlled ventilation. None of the (20) patients with leaks <110 mL developed stridor whereas one patient with a leak of 350 mL did and required reintubation. This led the investigators to conclude that the quantitative cuff-leak test was not reliable in this patient population. 155 In another study involving 110 trauma victims, cuff leaks of less than 10% had a 96% specificity for predicting post-extubation stridor or the need for reintubation. 156 De Bast and colleagues studied 76 adults in a combined medical-surgical ICU. 157 An equal number of patients had been intubated for more or less than 48 hours. Assistcontrol ventilation was reinstituted after cuff deflation, and the percentage of cuff leak was determined. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves yielded a cutoff value of 15.5% cuff leak to equalize the false positives and false negatives for reintubation due to laryngeal edema, but this study was relatively small. Among patients intubated for more than 48 hours, only 2 of 22 with large-volume leaks and 6 of 16 with small-volume leaks required reintubation for laryngeal edema.",

This produces a breathy voice but no obstruction and usually resolves within days to months. Bilateral ex-SLN injury causes the epiglottis to overhang, making the vocal folds difficult to visualize. If seen, they are bowed. This produces hoarseness with reduction in volume and range but no obstruction. Unilateral RLN injury causes the vocal fold to assume a fixed paramedian position and produces a hoarse voice. There may be a marginal airway with a weak cough. Bilateral RLN injury results in both vocal folds being fixed in the paramedian position and inspiratory stridor, often necessitating a surgical airway. 143 Pharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, and esophageal injuries include perforation, lacerations, contusions, and infections. These injuries may be associated with difficult laryngoscopy or intubation, but they may also result from the blind passage of a gum elastic bougie, 144 nasogastric tube, 145 nasotracheal tube, 146 suction catheter, esophageal stethoscope transesophageal echo probe, or temperature probe. 147 Penetrating injuries can communicate with the esophagus, resulting in a tracheoesophageal fistula, or with the mediastinum, which may go unrecognized and result in mediastinitis, retropharyngeal abscess, and death. 131 After a brief intubation, soft tissue injuries resulting in airway obstruction are more likely to result from edema or hematoma than infection. Most of the described injuries do not significantly complicate extubation. Laryngeal and tracheal stenoses are serious complications, but they are rarely evident at the time of extubation.",

It may be difficult to secure the tracheal tube because of involvement of the adjacent skin, and burn victims may be agitated or uncooperative, increasing the risk of unintended extubation. 148 Kemper and coworkers reported their management of 13 burn patients younger than 15 years, 7 of whom exhibited post-extubation stridor. Patients treated with heliumoxygen mixtures had lower stridor scores than patients treated with an air-oxygen mixture. 149 They found that 11 of 30 extubated burn victims required treatment for stridor after extubation, consisting of racemic epinephrine, helium-oxygen, reintubation (n = 5), or tracheostomy (n = 1). The absence of a cuff leak was considered to be the best predictor of failure, with a sensitivity of 100% and a positive predictive value of 79%. 149 patients developed post-extubation stridor, and 13 of 414 patients with volumes greater than 15.5% developed stridor, yielding positive and negative predictive values of 0.15 and 0.97, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of this test for post-extubation stridor were 0.35 and 0.91, respectively. The prevalence of post-extubation stridor was 20 of 462. Seven of these patients required reintubation; 15 were managed with racemic epinephrine or helium-oxygen mixtures, or both, and 2 of the 15 failed, requiring intubation. The investigators concluded that neither threshold adequately predicted postextubation stridor or could justify delaying extubation.",

The increase in venous pressure is aggravated by a lowered alveolar pressure, resulting in transudation of fluids into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli. It may also result in a rightward shift of the interatrial and interventricular septa, raising left atrial and ventricular pressures. Some instances may be complicated by a permeability defect with exudative fluid and inflammatory cells. [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] Postobstructive pulmonary edema usually occurs in adult patients with upper airway tumors, severe laryngospasm, or rarely, bilateral vocal cord palsy, 167 whereas in children, it occurs most commonly as a complication of croup or epiglottitis. 168 The onset may be within minutes of the development of airway obstruction. It typically resolves with relief of the obstruction and supportive treatment for pulmonary edema. 166",

Indirect laryngoscopy was performed on the third or fifth postoperative day. The RLN was damaged in 0.5% of patients with benign goiters and 10.6% of patients with thyroid cancer. RLN injury produces hoarseness, persistent coughing with phonation, and risk of aspiration. Unilateral RLN palsy was observed in 1.1% of patients. Three patients had bilateral RLN palsy and required tracheostomy. Six of a total of 16 deaths during the first 30 postoperative days were attributed to respiratory complications. One death occurred after failed intubation due to a deviated, constricted trachea. A second death was attributed to difficulties performing a tracheostomy. Two deaths resulted from aspiration or pneumonia, possibly related to RLN dysfunction. SLN injury is more challenging to diagnose. It produces dysphonia and vocal fatigue, particularly in the higher registers. In a 5-year, multicenter study involving 42 centers and almost 15,000 thyroid operations, the diagnosis was suspected in 3.7% and confirmed in 0.4% of patients. 172 Local hemorrhage or hematoma occurs postoperatively in 0.1% to 1.6% of patients undergoing thyroid surgery and in 0.36% of the patients cared for by Lacoste and colleagues. 27, [172] [173] [174] These complications occurred 5 minutes to 3 days postoperatively. Re-exploration within the first day was required only twice. Airway obstruction may result from significant laryngeal and pharyngeal edema, and wound evacuation may be of limited value in the relief of airway obstruction. 173, 175, 176 It may result from or be aggravated by ligature slippage, coughing, vomiting, 174 coagulopathies, and reoperation. 173 The prophylactic placement of surgical drains likely reduces the incidence of this complication. Wound evacuation may result in significant improvement; however this is not always the case. If time permits or intubation fails, wound evacuation should be considered. 176 Laryngeal edema may persist after the wound has been evacuated, necessitating postoperative intubation.",

[177] [178] [179] [180] [181] Although symptoms, computed tomography (CT), and pulmonary function test results make it easy to recognize airway compression preoperatively, tracheomalacia may be difficult to predict or even detect from the surgical field, and it does not become apparent until after the ETT is removed and spontaneous ventilation has resumed. 182 reduction of 62% \u00b1 9% (P < 0.025). Those remaining intubated as a result of swelling had contralateral extension of the swelling. These observations may help to explain why opening the wound frequently fails to provide benefit in many patients. Nonetheless, it may be difficult to clinically differentiate bleeding from swelling. After radiologic demonstration of swelling, the same group evaluated the benefits of prophylactic dexamethasone but failed to demonstrate any clinical benefit. 190 A 10-year, retrospective review of 3224 carotid endarterectomies performed at The Mayo Clinic revealed that 44 (1.4%) patients required wound exploration within 72 hours of surgery, despite the nonreversal of heparin. 191 In two patients, re-exploration occurred before the initial extubation. The decision to re-explore was made in the PACU for 7 patients; the remaining 35 were identified in the ICU or ward. Only one patient required a surgical airway when direct laryngoscopy failed in the ICU. Several techniques were initially employed: awake bronchoscopic intubation (15 of 20 of which were successful), direct laryngoscopy after induction (13 of 15 were successful), and awake direct laryngoscopy (5 of 7 were successful). When awake bronchoscopy failed, direct laryngoscopy was successful whether the patient was awake (3 of 3) or asleep (2 of 2). When direct laryngoscopy initially failed after induction in two patients, it succeeded after opening the incision. When awake direct laryngoscopy failed, one patient required a surgical airway; in the other, direct laryngoscopy succeeded after opening the incision. Despite the size of this series, it is not possible to draw conclusions about which techniques are most successful. Success likely depends on the skill and judgment of the airway manager. It is also possible that this study differed from the other studies in that the decision to re-explore was made earlier and patients had less airway distortion.",

            "text": "Neck swelling or hematoma formation after carotid endarterectomy may be relatively common. The New York Carotid Artery Surgery (NYCAS) study analyzed 9308 procedures performed between 1998 and 1999 at 167 hospitals. 183 A hematoma was identified in 5% of patients, substantially increasing the risk of death (OR = 4.30; 95% CI, 2.72 to 5.00) and stroke (OR = 3.89; 95% CI, 2.82 to 5.38). Hematoma occurrence reported in the literature ranges from 1.2% to 12%, depending on the definition used. 183 The overall rate of wound hematomas in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET), involving 1415 patients was 7.1%, 3.9% of which cases were considered to be mild (i.e., no delay in discharge), 3.0% were moderate (i.e., delay in discharge), and 0.3% were severe (i.e., permanent functional disability or death). The moderate and severe cases required re-exploration or wound evacuation (3.3%). Hematoma contributed to the death of four patients. 184 When wound hematomas are identified by a comparison of preoperative and postoperative CT scans, it occurs far more frequently (26%). 185 The postoperative reintubation or exploration rate is 1% to 3.3%. 184, 186 Kunkel and colleagues described 15 patients who developed wound hematomas after carotid endarterectomy. 187 Eight of these were evacuated under local anesthesia. In six of seven cases in which general anesthesia was induced before opening the wound, difficulties arose with airway management, resulting in two deaths and one patient with severe neurologic impairment. O'Sullivan and coworkers reported a similar experience for six patients with airway obstruction after carotid endarterectomy. 188 Stridor was not relieved by wound evacuation. Administration of muscle relaxants made manual mask ventilation and tracheal intubation virtually impossible due to marked glottic or supraglottic edema. Cyanosis and extreme bradydysrhythmias or asystole occurred in four patients. The providers endorsed Kunkle's recommendation for wound evacuation but thought that much of the airway compromise was caused by edema from venous or lymphatic congestion. They emphasized that the outward appearance may lead to an underestimation of the situation's gravity. Voice changes are early signs of danger and may be relatively subtle. Rapid clinical deterioration can occur after stridor develops. 189 Studies by Carmichael and colleagues provided additional evidence for the role of swelling and bleeding in a small but elegant study. They compared the CT scans of 19 patients before and after carotid endarterectomy surgery. 185 Clinically, 1 patient had severe swelling, 4 had moderate swelling, and 3 had mild swelling, but 10 were deemed normal. However, postoperative CT scans demonstrated significant swelling of the retropharyngeal space and a reduction of the anteroposterior and transverse airway diameter, particularly at the level of the hyoid. Compared with preoperative CT scans, the calculated volume reduction averaged 32% \u00b1 7% for extubated patients. The scans revealed a wound hematoma estimated to be greater than 10 mL (range, 44 to 94 mL) in 5 of 19 patients. Patients who remained intubated postoperatively showed a significantly greater volume and breathing difficulties, and 5 (2.7%) required reintubation. Two patients required tracheostomy, and two deaths were attributed to airway obstruction and unsuccessful reintubation.",

This surgical approach requires tracheal and esophageal retraction toward the opposite side to permit exposure. Drains were placed, and all patients were immobilized by a halo vest or a rigid head-cervical-thoracic orthosis. They identified seven patients (5.3%) who required postoperative reintubation, and although they did not compare these patients with those not requiring reintubation, they attempted to identify common features that increased the risk of postoperative airway compromise. Three patients were immediately reintubated in the operating room, and four were reintubated 12 to 91 hours postoperatively. Severe hypopharyngeal swelling was observed at reintubation in four of seven patients and possibly in a fifth. Five of the seven reintubations had no serious sequelae; these patients were extubated within 2 to 8 days. One patient required a cricothyroidotomy, but delay resulted in hypoxic encephalopathy and death. Another patient was reintubated but developed and succumbed to severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. The investigators think that preexisting pulmonary disease, moderate or severe preoperative myelopathy, extensive multilevel decompression with prolonged surgery, and tissue retraction were risk factors for postoperative airway obstruction, but there were no controls. 26 They recommended 1 to 3 days of elective intubation postoperatively, a cuff-leak test, and direct laryngoscopy at extubation.",

Gunshot wounds or physical altercations also cause maxillofacial injury. Airway obstruction is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients, and many die before they reach the hospital. 203 Those with less life-threatening injuries are likely to present with a full stomach, and many have associated head and neck injuries, lacerations, loose or avulsed teeth, intraoral fractures, and fractures extending into the paranasal sinuses, into the orbit, or through the cribriform plate. They may also have an unstable cervical spine or damage to the neural axis. Injuries to the lower face raise the possibility of a laryngeal fracture. Intermaxillary fixation may be part of the surgical plan, necessitating a nasal intubation or a surgical airway. Timing of tracheal extubation is complex and must take into consideration factors such as the patient's level of consciousness, ability to maintain satisfactory gas exchange, coagulation status, and integrity of protective airway reflexes. Attention must be paid to the difficulties originally encountered in securing the airway and an evaluation of whether reintubation would be easier or more difficult after surgery and resuscitation. Most of the trauma literature about airway management addresses intubation and offers little help with extubation, making cooperation between the anesthesiologist, 204,205 surgeon, and critical care physician essential. Intermaxillary fixation requires wire cutters to be immediately available and personnel to know which wires to cut. A flexible bronchoscope, provisions for an emergency surgical airway, and the required expertise should be immediately available at the time of extubation. Alternatives include prophylactic tracheotomy, submental intubation, 206-208 nasal intubation, and bronchoscopic airway evaluation performed before extubation, 209 although assessment may be limited to supraglottic structures and exclusion of tube entrapment. Ideally, extubation should be accomplished in a reversible manner, permitting supplemental oxygenation, ventilation, and reintubation if needed (see \"Extubation Strategies\").",

When head frames are used, they may impede access for SGA placement or laryngoscopy. Similarly, patients in cervical immobilization devices for spinal cord protection may undergo high-risk surgical procedures. 116 Careful planning for their extubation is critical because reintubation may be difficult, and rapid surgical access may be virtually impossible. Full recovery of strength and consciousness, persistence of respiratory drive, the presence of a cuff leak, preservation of protective reflexes, and absence of significant tongue swelling are the essential prerequisites for extubation. Postoperative seizures, vomiting, elevated intracranial pressure, and neurologic obtundation may make extubation particularly hazardous. Several of the strategies described subsequently should be given serious consideration in managing these patients.",

Treatment with bronchodilators produced no benefit, and his condition improved immediately after intubation. With the ETT, compliance and resistance appeared normal. This patient's levodopa or carbidopa had not been resumed postoperatively, and the investigators speculated that this caused or contributed to upper airway obstruction. Because most patients with Parkinson's disease are elderly and may have comorbidities that can make the diagnosis uncertain, it is important to consider involvement of the upper airway and the dramatic effect withdrawal and reinstatement of medications can have on their clinical course. This concern is reinforced by a case report describing a patient who developed airway obstruction and acute respiratory acidosis requiring intubation preoperatively because five doses of his antiparkinsonian medications were withheld while he was being fasted. 244 Easdown and colleagues emphasized the importance of continuing these medications, and avoidance of dopamine antagonists throughout the perioperative period. 243 Backus and colleagues described a patient with longstanding Parkinson's disease who became aphonic, developed stridor, and suffered respiratory arrest shortly after taking cough medication. 245 Complete upper airway obstruction recurred with vocal fold apposition immediately after extubation. Four days later, the patient extubated herself with no further complications. The investigators interpreted this spontaneous laryngospasm as a manifestation of Parkinson's disease. Others have observed upper airway dysfunction, airflow limitation, and bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis in association with Parkinson's disease. The first episode might not have been spontaneous but instead a consequence of aspiration of the cough medicine. Nonetheless, there remains a possibility that these patients are more prone to laryngospasm, whether spontaneous or induced by glottic stimulation.",

Dysphonia, most frequently hypophonia, occurs in approximately 70% to 90% of patients with Parkinson's disease. 238, 239 Video stroboscopic findings include laryngeal tremor, vocal fold bowing, and abnormal glottic opening and closing. 239 Several neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple system atrophy, have some features in common with Parkinson's disease, including dysphonia, and these patients may exhibit bilateral abductor vocal fold paresis. Typically, symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease progress insidiously, are not recognized by the patient, and may be associated with nocturnal stridor. These features resemble those of OSA identified by polysomnography. Many of these patients may benefit from nocturnal CPAP or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP). 238 Blumin and Berke described seven patients, only one of whom presented for surgery. This patient underwent a transurethral prostate resection under general anesthesia, and 2 weeks after surgery, he returned with biphasic stridor that necessitated an emergent tracheostomy. It is unclear whether there was a relationship between the surgery or anesthesia and subsequent airway obstruction. Patients with multiple system atrophy have daytime hypoxemia associated with abnormal laryngopharyngeal movements, including obstruction at the arytenoids, epiglottis, base of the tongue, and soft palate. The significance of these problems is unclear, but they may contribute to complications after extubation. 240 Vincken and colleagues studied 27 patients with extrapyramidal disorders. 241 Twenty-four had flow-volume loops, many of which demonstrated saw-toothed oscillations, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. They observed oscillations with rhythmic (4 to 8 Hz) or irregular movements of the glottis and supraglottic structures. Ten patients exhibited intermittent upper airway obstruction. Four patients had stridor or dyspnea. The investigators believed that the upper airway was the primary site of involvement. In a subsequent report, they observed symptomatic improvement with levodopa despite persistence of the oscillatory pattern on flow-volume loops. 242 Inspiratory and expiratory flows after levodopa increased from 1.40 to 3.50 L/sec and 0.95 to 5.05 L/sec, respectively. Bronchodilators provided no additional benefit. This case may have important implications for the direct laryngoscopic or flexible bronchoscopy. Retrospectively reviewing 128 consecutive posterior cervical procedures, upper airway obstruction characterized by stridor occurred in 9 of 128 patients, 1 of 70 patients intubated with bronchoscopic guidance, and 8 of 58 patients intubated otherwise (i.e., direct laryngoscopy or blind nasotracheal technique). Five patients (all in the nonbronchoscopic group) required emergency reintubation that proved to be very difficult, with two near fatalities and one death. Although the two groups were similar with regard to age, gender, American Rheumatology Association classification, ASA physical status, duration of surgery and anesthesia, fluid balance, and postoperative immobilization, there were significant differences in time to extubation. Seven of the patients could not be intubated by flexible bronchoscopy and were therefore intubated by a nonfiberoptic technique. The patients were not randomized to different methods; criteria for the method of intubation and techniques were not described; all patients were intubated awake; and the study was carried out over an 11-year period. 261 Although it is not possible to draw firm conclusions from this study, there was a high incidence (7%) of post-extubation stridor and difficult or failed reintubations, regardless of the intubation technique.",

Inflammatory changes may include effusion, pannus formation, joint erosion, and ankylosis, any of which may compromise the joint's functions. Its involvement may be unsuspected or mistaken for asthma until intubation or after extubation and may necessitate a surgical airway. 258, 259 Dysphonia, dyspnea, or stridor should raise suspicion of this possibility. Complete airway obstruction is a welldescribed but uncommon complication, despite involvement of the cricoarytenoids in 26% to 86% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 251, 259 Laryngoscopy may reveal a rough and thick mucosa with narrowing of the vocal chink. Although airway obstruction occurs most commonly in patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis with polyarticular and systemic involvement, laryngeal stridor has been described as the sole manifestation of this disease. 260 Keenan and coworkers described tracheal scoliosis, which consisted of tracheal deviation, laryngeal rotation, anterior angulation, and vocal fold adduction seen fiberoptically and on CT scans. 255 It was presumed to result from the loss of vertical height and asymmetrical bony erosions.",

It usually occurs early in the course of the disease and may manifest as hoarseness, nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, and stridor. Upper airway obstruction is usually diffuse and may progress to involve the glottis, subglottic area, trachea, and bronchial cartilages. Histologically, there is evidence of perichondral inflammation and replacement of cartilage by fibrous tissue that manifests as inflammatory swelling and progressive destruction of cartilage. The clinical manifestations range from bronchorrhea and recurrent pneumonia to airway collapse. Medical management consists of steroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and immunosuppressant agents, but their benefit varies. Surgical management consists of external airway splinting or selfexpanding metallic stents. These patients may present for bronchoscopy, tracheostomy, tracheal or nasal reconstruction, aortic valve replacement, or stent placement. 264, [267] [268] [269] [270] [271] Airway collapse after extubation should be anticipated and may be temporarily dealt with by CPAP. 272, 273 ",

The pathophysiology and perioperative airway management of OSA in obese patients has been comprehensively reviewed. [274] [275] [276] Many surgical patients have undiagnosed or untreated OSA. OSA syndrome is associated with an increased risk of gastroesophageal reflux, difficult mask ventilation [276] [277] [278] and laryngoscopic intubation, [279] [280] [281] [282] and accelerated arterial oxygen desaturation. 276, 283 The risk of airway obstruction after surgery is increased for patients with OSA; life-threatening post-extubation obstruction occurred in 7 (5%) of 135 patients. 279, 284 Rapid desaturation, difficult mask ventilation, and difficult direct laryngoscopy make this a particularly high-risk setting. 285 The ASA practice guidelines nor intubated. Knowledge of prior difficulties may result in intubation conditions that are less favorable to success. Repeated attempts at laryngoscopy are associated with a significant increase in the risk of hypoxemia, esophageal intubation, regurgitation, aspiration, bradycardia, and cardiac arrest. 2, 301 To avoid this risk, flexible bronchoscopic intubation may be considered, but in an agitated, hypoxic patient with secretions or blood in the airway, it may be difficult to achieve adequate topical anesthesia, and the procedure may be difficult or impossible.",

Ideally, the strategy should permit continued administration of oxygen or ventilation of a failing patient even while the airway is emergency surgery, pain, obesity, narcotics, nausea, ileus, bowel obstruction, pregnancy, some surgical positions, depressed level of consciousness, inadequate depth of anesthesia, postoperative drowsiness, and residual neuromuscular blockade. Despite the ubiquity of these conditions, perioperative aspiration is not commonly identified. Before intubation, difficult bag-mask ventilation may result in gastric distention, which may be further complicated if laryngoscopy proves difficult because it may delay securing the airway. Repeated laryngoscopic attempts may cause edema, thereby increasing glottic resistance. Aspiration may also result from obtundation or conditions that impair vocal cord apposition (e.g., vocal cord paralysis, laryngeal incompetence, residual neuromuscular blockade, granulomas). Aspiration can cause serious morbidity and death. [292] [293] [294] [295] Although most incidents of aspiration seem to occur at induction, many occur during maintenance and recovery from anesthesia. 296 Numerous strategies have been described to reduce the risk at induction, but relatively little information is available on how best to prevent this later. Premature extubation, postoperative nausea, delayed gastric emptying, residual neuromuscular blockade, relaxation of the esophageal sphincters, decreased level of consciousness, gagging on an ETT, supine recovery, and impaired laryngeal competence may make emergence from anesthesia and tracheal extubation as problematic as induction. A kinked or clamped nasogastric tube may promote regurgitation and aspiration. Evidence-based recommendations on an extubation strategy to reduce aspiration are not available. It would seem logical to minimize the contributing factors: postoperative nausea and vomiting, residual neuromuscular blockade, decreased level of consciousness and associated diminished protective airway reflexes, and gastric evacuation. We do not know whether gastric decompression reduces aspiration; a well-seated i-gel SGA 297 or ProSeal LMA may or may not offer some protection from aspiration. [298] [299] [300] With the current information, it is not appropriate to recommend the elective use of these devices in a patient at increased risk for aspiration.",

In urgent or emergent circumstances, methods that had previously been successful may not be available or appropriate. The required equipment, necessary skills, or time required to perform alternative techniques may not be available. Uncertainty regarding the ease of ventilation or intubation may correctly lead to disinclination to administer paralytic and sedating drugs. Although they may facilitate ventilation and intubation, failure will result in an apneic patient who can neither be ventilated procedures. 304 Muscle relaxation was then reversed, and the anesthetic was discontinued. The LMAs were removed when the patients resumed spontaneous ventilation and obeyed commands. None of the 10 patients coughed, and changes in the rate-pressure product (indicating cardiac oxygen requirements) were minimal. The investigators concluded that the technique might prove useful in patients undergoing other types of surgical procedures. They stressed that this substitution should be performed only by those skilled in LMA insertion. Patients must be at a sufficient depth of anesthesia or coughing, breath-holding, laryngospasm, and the very pressor responses this substitution is intended to avoid may occur. Bailey and others recommended that the LMA be inserted before removal of the ETT to prevent losing the airway after tracheal extubation. 80, 305 Compared with deep tracheal extubation followed by Guedel airway insertion, there was a lower incidence of coughing and requirement for airway manipulation. 305 Koga and coworkers compared this technique with deep and awake tracheal extubation. 80 They observed no difference in recovery conditions between patients in whom the ETT was removed by deep or awake methods; however, they noticed a significant improvement in recovery conditions when the LMA substitution was performed. This technique is useful but can jeopardize a secure airway if not properly executed. It should be practiced on routine airways before use in higher-risk extubations. 306 Brimacombe suggested (personal communication, December 2010) that a ProSeal LMA or LMA Supreme with a gum elastic bougie inserted through the drainage tube could produce a more secure substitution for an ETT. 307 Sometimes, it is desirable to perform the exchange of an ETT for an SGA in reverse. Several types of tube exchanges have been described. Asai wanted to replace a damaged ETT in a patient who had been a difficult intubation. 308 He inserted an LMA Classic behind the existing ETT. A fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) with a replacement 7-mm ETT was introduced through the LMA; the FOB was advanced through the vocal cords, and the original ETT was removed. The new ETT was then advanced over the FOB, which was removed. To extend the length of the ETT to enable its removal from the LMA, another ETT was inserted into the proximal end of the replacement ETT. 308 This technique was complicated and could easily have failed.",

Deep extubation ordinarily occurs after full recovery of neuromuscular function and the resumption of spontaneous ventilation. Its purported advantage is avoidance of the adverse reflexes associated with extubation, such as hypertension, dysrhythmias, coughing, laryngospasm, and increased intraocular or intracranial pressures. The fundamental disadvantage of deep extubation is the patient's inability to protect his airway against obstruction and aspiration. When deep extubation is improperly executed, laryngospasm and its attendant complications are more likely to occur. Although not having to wait for the recovery of consciousness may accelerate operating room turnover, this approach is more difficult to justify when anesthetic agents having a faster elimination time are available. Delays in recovery usually are brief. Unscavenged volatile anesthetic agents may also represent an occupational health hazard. A significant proportion of American anesthesiologists practice the technique, at least some of the time, but there are few data for adults that compare the safety of deep extubation with that of awake extubation. 12 Koga and colleagues compared three small groups of adult patients who underwent deep extubation, awake extubation, or deep extubation after the insertion of an LMA. 80 Straining occurred in a high (but comparable) proportion of patients whether the ETT was removed before or after recovery of consciousness.",

Replacement of an ETT with an SGA provides an excellent means of performing a fiberoptic assessment of glottic and subglottic anatomy and function. After the substitution is performed and the patient is under anesthesia or a suitable degree of sedation, muscle relaxation can be reversed and spontaneous ventilation allowed to resume. An FOB is then passed through the SGA, and vocal fold movement and appearance can be assessed while the concentrations of oxygen and volatile agents (if necessary) can be controlled. The view is protected from oral secretions, and inadequate ventilation can be supplemented. PVCM or tracheomalacia can be visually and functionally evaluated, although both may be minimal if the patient is deeply anesthetized. This technique is useful in patients with recurrent post-extubation stridor or those at risk for static or dynamic tracheal stenosis. We frequently employ this technique in patients undergoing thyroidectomy when tracheomalacia or vocal fold paralysis is suspected. 181",

Others have used a gum elastic bougie to achieve similar objectives. [321] [322] [323] [324] Cook Critical Care designed the Mizus Endotracheal Tube Replacement Obturator (METTRO) for the replacement of endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes ( Fig. 50-2) . It is available in two sizes: 70 cm long (7.0 F, 2.3 mm) for replacement of ETTs as small as 3 mm and 80 cm long (19 F, 6.3 mm) for passing through tubes 7 mm or larger. The METTRO is a single-use, flexible, radiopaque, solid device with a tapered tip and distance markings. The package insert instructs the user to advance this device until resistance is encountered, but this recommendation can result in coughing, discomfort, ProSeal, 314, 315 and the LMA Supreme. 316 The Aintree intubation catheter is 56 cm long and has an internal diameter (ID) of 4.7 mm; its outer diameter (OD) is 6.3 mm (19 F). A bronchoscope (<4 mm) can be inserted through the device, leaving 3 or 4 cm protruding beyond its tip. A 7-mm or larger ETT can be advanced over it. Only the distal 3 to 4 cm of the protruding bronchoscope is flexible, but it is usually sufficient to allow successful maneuvering into the trachea, after which the SGA is removed and a replacement ETT is advanced over the Aintree catheter. A Rapi-Fit adapter is provided to enable positive-pressure ventilation while the substitution is performed. The Aintree intubation catheter and FOB are inserted together through the SGA. There are several advantages of this technique. 315, 317 It can be used to facilitate conversion from an unmodified LMA to an oral ETT of adequate size. Sufficient length allows the LMA to be removed with minimal risk of losing the airway. The Aintree intubation catheter fits tightly to the insertion cord of the FOB and to the ETT, thereby reducing the size discrepancy that often results in difficult glottic passage. The catheter can be used as a conduit for manual or jet ventilation during an exchange. An LMA Classic, inserted as a rescue device (for \"cannot intubate, cannot ventilate\" cases) can facilitate safe tube exchange without the need for an intubating LMA.",

It also permits assessment of supraglottic structures. 318 These opportunities can be maximized by reassuring the patient and by providing judicious sedation, an antisialagogue, and the use of a Yankauer sucker for oral secretions. The oropharynx is suctioned, taking care to avoid inducing a gag reflex. The FOB is placed above the carina, and the cuff is slowly deflated to minimize coughing. The ETT is slowly withdrawn into the oropharynx, followed by very gradual withdrawal of the FOB to the supraglottic region. After the patient is comfortable, the FOB is further withdrawn to a position just above the vocal cords. Even with this deliberate technique, the exercise is frequently frustrated by excessive secretions, coughing, swallowing, or poor tolerance with insufficient opportunity of visualizing the structures of interest.",

Proximally, two types of connectors are secured and released by a patented Rapi-Fit adapter (see Fig. 50 -5B).

The T.T.X. was then grasped with two Magill forceps; the caudal one was used to stabilize the catheter, and the cephalad one was used to withdraw the proximal end out of the mouth. An oral tube was then railroaded over the T.T.X. Cooper described a similar maneuver in a patient in whom oral fiberoptic intubation could not be accomplished, but fiberoptic nasal intubation was achieved. 354 He passed an ETVC through the existing nasal tube and removed the latter. The ETVC was then stabilized with caudal Magill forceps and withdrawn through the mouth with the cephalad forceps. Oxygen insufflation was provided through the ETVC, which was then used to thread an oral tube into the trachea.

[344] [345] [346] The WuScope provided a good glottic view in a morbidly obese patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome and permitted insertion of a suction catheter anterior to the existing nasotracheal tube. The nasotracheal tube was withdrawn, and the replacement oral ETT was easily advanced over the suction catheter with minimal interruption of mechanical ventilation. We think that a visually direct tube exchange with a WuScope, Bullard Scope (Circon, Santa Barbara, CA), Upsher UltraScope (Mercury Medical, Clearwater, FL), or video laryngoscope is preferable to blind passage of an ETT over a flexible bronchoscope or tube exchanger. A hollow tube exchanger, however, would have permitted oxygen insufflation or jet ventilation had desaturation or difficulties with tube advancement occurred. A supraglottic view (in contrast to the infraglottic view provided by a flexible bronchoscope) of the exchange enables identification and correction of an ETT impingement or the outward migration of the exchange catheter. 347 The concept of visually direct tube exchange was assessed retrospectively in a population in whom no view of the larynx could be obtained by direct laryngoscopy. 348 Using one of three indirect laryngoscopes-the Glidescope (Verathon Medical, Bothell WA), Airtraq (Prodol Meditec, Vizcaya, Spain), or McGrath Series 5 (Aircraft Medical, Edinburgh, Scotland)-in conjunction with an AEC, 51 exchanges were performed. Four of the cases tube and its loading dilator are placed over the AEC, which is connected to the Rapi-Fit adapter, permitting ventilation as required. The loading catheter and tracheostomy catheter are advanced using the AEC as a guide. If stomal dilatation is required, the set is equipped with Ciglia Blue Rhino dilators (32 to 38 F). 360 The only description of this device advocates jet ventilation and high-flow oxygen insufflation. AEC insertion must be atraumatic, confirmed with a carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) tracing, and the depth verified to ensure it is not beyond the carina. Only the amount of oxygen (O 2 ) required to prevent significant oxygen desaturation should be supplied.",

In most circumstances, a patient's oxygen content can be adequately sustained with insufflation, obviating the need for high-pressure jet ventilation. If oxygen requirements are high before a tube exchange, the equipment should be immediately available to provide jet ventilation. This equipment consists of a manually cycled, Venturi-type jet ventilator with a Luer-Lok adapter and an in-line pressure-reducing valve (see Fig. 50-8) . 361 The objective of jet ventilation is to correct life-threatening hypoxemia-not to normalize arterial blood gases. Although the achievement of normal PaCO 2 may be attainable, the risks quite likely exceed the benefits. 343 Barotrauma has occurred through such misguided objectives, and it has been fatal in some cases.",

He was awake and comfortable at the conclusion of surgery. He was extubated over an AEC, through which oxygen was insufflated at 5 L/min. On arrival in the PACU, he was distressed and complained of back pain and difficulty breathing. Shortly thereafter, he had a cardiac arrest. Needle thoracentesis revealed a tension pneumothorax, and although the initial resuscitation restored a pulse, he developed hypoxic encephalopathy and died. It is unclear whether the insertion was traumatic (although the autopsy did not reveal a laceration or perforation at the distal tip location), whether the flows were at some point much higher, or whether jet ventilation had been employed at any time. The specific device, its size, and details regarding its insertion and fixation are unknown, but it is advisable to obtain a capnographic tracing before applying oxygen insufflation or jet ventilation.

The patient recovered but had a left pneumothorax that was attributed to catheter migration and unilateral ventilation. The investigators mentioned that they had encountered three cases of pneumothoraces and one pneumoperitoneum in approximately 600 similar procedures. They drew attention to the importance of catheter placement and advised that even brief airway obstruction can result in barotrauma. However, they failed to mention that vocal fold apposition occurring during recovery might promote this complication. In a subsequent paper, the same investigators stated that the jet stylet had been used for the ventilation of six patients, resulting in normocarbia and adequate ventilation. 331 Baraka described a patient with a poor laryngeal view in whom an ETT exchange was facilitated using a CAEC. 366 This was advanced until resistance was encountered. Jet ventilation at 50 psi was commenced before withdrawal of the ETT or deflation of its cuff. The result was right-chest expansion but incomplete deflation, but within three breaths, asystole was observed. A needle thoracotomy confirmed the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax, and sinus rhythm was restored. 366 Egol and colleagues described pneumothoraces and a pneumoperitoneum in three patients using a variety of delivery devices and driving pressures. 333 They included an 18-F suction catheter at 50 psi, a nasogastric sump tube at 20 psi (inspiratory time at 30%), and a fiberoptic laryngoscope at 40 psi. They attributed the barotrauma observed to incorrect catheter placement, ventilation during phonation, and possible direct mucosal penetration from jet injection. They examined the relationship between the number of distal side holes in the tube exchanger and the pressure at the catheter tip. At any given driving pressure, the more side holes, the lower the pressure at the catheter tip. They recommended vigilance regarding the location of the catheter tip, including avoidance of direct mucosal contact and insertion into orifices where exhalation might be restricted. They advocated securing the catheter to minimize migration, use of catheters with multiple side holes, use of small-diameter jet catheters to minimize the resistance to exhalation, and use of the minimal effective driving pressure. They encouraged the development and use of an effective pressure sensor and pressure-cutoff device.",

They simulated upper airway obstruction by using various sizes of ETT adapters (11-to 3.5-mm ID) in the proximal airway. The gas flows through the large, medium, and small tube exchangers, when connected to a pressure source of 50 psi, were 63, 33, and 12 L/min, respectively. In their model, if the difference between the tracheal and T.T.X. diameters resulted in an effective tracheal diameter that was greater than 4 to 4.5 mm, air trapping did not occur. Because increased upper airway resistance and reduced effective tracheal diameter resulted in larger tidal volumes, they concluded that jet ventilation through a long catheter that was positioned close to the carina caused little Venturi effect or air entrainment. Placement of the catheter close to the carina may ensure a higher oxygen concentration by reducing room air entrainment, but it also increases the risk of distal catheter migration and barotrauma.",

The ASA Task Force and the Canadian Airway Focus Group have recommended that each anesthesiologist have a preformulated strategy for extubation of the difficult airway. A risk stratification scheme can be used to identify patients for whom special extubation precautions seem to be warranted. Although many strategies are available, their benefits have not been subjected to rigorous evaluation. A reversible extubation can be performed with a tube exchanger. Use of a stylet does not guarantee that reintubation will succeed.

Arterial blood gases in 12 consecutive, critically ill patients revealed a pH of 7.37 \u00b1 0.09, PaCO 2 of 45.5 \u00b1 10.8, and PaO 2 of 256 \u00b1 126 (mean \u00b1 SD). In a subsequent report, a patient ventilated for 90 minutes at only 20 psi developed a pneumothorax. 343 Chan and Manninen also described use of the ETVC to provide jet ventilation. 368 After performing a fiberoptic intubation in a patient with an unstable cervical spine, they discovered that the cuff of the ETT had been damaged. They inserted a flexible bronchoscope through the other nostril and advanced it through the vocal cords anterior to the original ETT. They then passed an ETVC through the original ETT and provided three breaths of jet ventilation at 50 psi. The patient developed a pneumothorax. Unfortunately, they used a high driving pressure through an exchange catheter that might have been too deeply inserted in the setting of near-complete glottic occlusion (i.e., partial cuff deflation, 6-mm ETT, and an FOB passing through the vocal cords). These cases reinforce the general principles previously stated. 343, 369 The need for jet ventilation should always be weighed against its possible risks. It should be immediately available and used when there is evidence of deteriorating oxygenation. If a 15-mm connector is available, capnography should be used to confirm intratracheal placement. An in-line pressure-reducing valve should be used, and ventilation should begin with the lowest pressure capable of producing adequate chest expansion. The duration of inspiration should be minimized while the duration of exhalation is determined by observing the return of the thoracic diameter to its position before inspiratory. The depth of catheter insertion should be far enough from the carina that distal migration does not occur but not so proximal that jet ventilation results in the catheter's ejection from the glottis. Multiple distal side holes can reduce catheter whip and the distal catheter pressure during jet ventilation. Every effort must be taken to minimize expiratory resistance. \u2022 Reintubation may fail because of inadequate access to the airway (e.g., halo fixation, maxillomandibular fixation), preexisting anatomic features (e.g., retrognathism, prominent incisors), inadequate preparation, lack of expertise or insufficient information (e.g., emergencies), a rapidly deteriorating clinical state, or blood, secretions, or swelling obscuring the visual field.",

The patient has been extubated, and a laryngeal mask airway has been introduced before reversal of neuromuscular blockade or awakening. This reduces coughing on emergence, allowing gradual recovery and assessment of spontaneous respiratory function while minimizing the potential distraction of the surgical anastomosis. It also provides the optimal means of performing flexible laryngobronchial examination under controlled conditions. (Courtesy of Patrick Gullane, MD, University Health Network, Toronto, Ont.)",

The adapter permits continuation of positive pressure ventilation while a bronchoscope is introduced through the original endotracheal tube (ETT). The guidewire is inserted through the bronchoscope's working channel, and the original ETT and bronchoscope are withdrawn. A tapered exchange catheter is advanced over the guidewire, and it may be connected with a 15-mm or jet Rapi-Fit adapter to provide ventilation.
