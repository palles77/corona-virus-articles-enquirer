The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that one third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and that 1 in 8 deaths in the world today is due to tuberculosis. 1 After the discovery and introduction of antituberculosis medications in the late 1940s, there was hope that TB would soon be eliminated. However, after decades of steady decline, the number of reported TB cases began to increase in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the United States. This resurgence was fueled by several factors: the deterioration of the TB public health infrastructure, the onset of the HIV epidemic, increases in immigration of persons from countries where TB was common, and outbreaks in congregate settings such as hospitals and correctional institutions.",

In the early 1990s, several outbreaks of MDR-TB occurred in hospitals and correctional facilities in Florida and New York, involving more than 250 MDR-TB cases. 2,3 Most patients in these outbreaks were coinfected with HIV. The mortality rate was approximately 80%, and the interval between TB diagnosis and death was short, ranging from 4 to 16 weeks. In addition to hospitalized patients and inmates, transmission of MDR-TB to health care workers and prison guards occurred; at least 9 of these workers developed active MDR-TB, and 5 died. Globally, 400,000 new cases of MDR-TB occur each year. 4 Currently, drug-sensitive TB can be treated with first-line drugs for 6 to 9 months, and 95% of patients can be cured with these regimens. In contrast, MDR-TB requires treatment for 18 to 24 months with second-line drugs (Table 2) 5 that are inherently less effective, often poorly tolerated by patients, and much more expensive. Under optimal conditions, the cure rate is 70% to 90% but is closer to 50% in diverse clinical practice.",

In early 2005, physicians from KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa reported an outbreak of TB with an alarmingly high mortality rate. 6 Of 221 patients with MDR-TB, 53 were found to have what is now known as XDR-TB; 52 of the 53 patients died, and the median survival was only 16 days from the time the first sputum sample was collected.",

Patients in whom the diagnosis of XDR-TB is delayed spread the infection to close contacts who then acquire primary XDR-TB. Areas of the world that have high HIV rates are especially at risk for XDR-TB outbreaks because HIV infection predicts extreme vulnerability to TB. Conventionally, TB is diagnosed by culturing the organism on liquid or solid media followed by identification of the species and then drug susceptibility testing. Since mycobacteria are slow growing, this process can take several weeks and can be technically challenging. This is highlighted in the case of Speaker, in whom the initial diagnosis of TB was made in late March. However, he was identified as having only MDR-TB on May 10, and it was not until May 22 that the extent of drug resistance was realized. 10 Recent advances in molecular biology and understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance in TB have led to newer diagnostic tools, some of which can provide information on susceptibility patterns in days. 11 A pilot study to evaluate some of these tests is currently under way in South Africa. 12, 13 Speaker was smear negative (ie, no tuberculosis bacilli were visible on microscopic examination of his sputum); hence, the risk of TB transmission from him is low but not zero. Subsequently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that all his copassengers on 2 international flights be tested for TB. 14 This has caused a great deal of anxiety in the general public about the risk of infections related to air travel.",

Most modern aircraft have recirculation systems that recycle up to 50% of cabin air. However, this air is passed through high efficiency particulate air filters, similar to the ones used in hospitals, that remove 99.9% of particulate matter, bacteria, fungi, and viruses that are between 0.1 and 0.3 \u00b5m. The tubercle bacillus is approximately 0.5 to 1.0 \u00b5m and thus is removed by high efficiency particulate air filters. 16 Air enters and leaves the cabin at approximately the same seat row, and little front to back airflow occurs ( Figure  2 ). This air circulation pattern means that essentially the cabin is divided into sections, and spread of airborne particles from a passenger is limited to the section in which he or she is seated. This is borne out by the fact that in reports of airborne disease transmission on aircraft, transmission has generally occurred to people close to a contagious passenger (within 2 rows) for a long time (>8 hours). Important exceptions are when flights are delayed, the aircraft is parked on the ground, and the aircraft ventilation system is not operating. 18 According to the US Department of Transportation, \"if the ventilation system is not operating, passengers should not stay aboard the plane for more than 30 minutes.\"",

            "text": "Isolation and quarantine are public health strategies that aim to control exposure to infections. Isolation refers to the separation of persons who have a specific infectious illness from those who are healthy to stop the spread of that illness. In contrast, quarantine refers to the separation and restriction of movement of persons who, although not yet ill, have been exposed to an infectious agent and therefore may become infectious. Local, state, and tribal jurisdictions are primarily responsible for isolation and quarantine within their borders. The federal government has the primary responsibility to prevent interstate spread of disease and to prevent the introduction of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States. 23 The communicable diseases for which federal isolation and quarantine are authorized by presidential order are infectious TB, cholera, diphtheria, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers, SARS, and influenza with pandemic potential. This federal quarantine provision was last invoked in 1963 to deal with a patient infected with smallpox, but local public health authorities exercise the right to enforce isolation more frequently. In fact, a person with XDR-TB is currently incarcerated in a Phoenix jail for failing to comply with a physician's instructions to wear a mask in public. 24 SUMMARY It remains unclear how Speaker became infected with XDR-TB. Additionally, it may never be known whether he understood the fact that he had a serious and potentially communicable form of TB and still chose to ignore medical advice or whether he simply did not understand all the implications of his diagnosis. His trans-Atlantic multicountry odyssey highlights the fact yet again that spread of infectious agents via global air travel remains a very real threat and that international cooperation remains vital to limit the spread of infections. Moreover, this case draws attention to the fact that TB remains a great threat to humanity worldwide; in the words of US Representatives Eliot L. Engel and Gene Green \"We'll get nowhere on TB till we tackle it everywhere.\" 25 Priya Sampathkumar, MD Division of Infectious Diseases Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minn",
