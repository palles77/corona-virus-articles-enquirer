Several of these findings have also been reported in medRxiv [7] .",

Second, it is our opinion that COVID-19 can be either prevented or controlled within a hemodialysis facility, and the key is to take effective measures early, including timely upgrading of personal protection measures and implementation of universal screening (Box 1), followed by quarantine and isolation as needed. We found that chest computed tomography (CT) was an appropriate screening test given easy availability and high sensitivity. Third, we were surprised to find that, although HD patients are susceptible to COVID-19, most presented with either no symptoms or only mild clinical signs and symptoms.",

            "text": "Although 7 HD patients died during the epidemic, including 6 with and 1 without COVID-19, no patient died of severe pneumonia caused by COVID-19; interestingly, the major cause of death was cardiovascular events, which seem to be related to insufficient dialysis due to patients missing hemodialysis sessions to avoid possible infection. In addition, we hypothesize that, because of chronic immune dysfunction seen in hemodialysis patients, SARS-Cov-2 virus infection did not trigger the inflammatory storm that appears to mediate clinical deterioration or death in many COVID-19 patients [8] .",
