WHO assembled an international multidisciplinary panel to develop rapid advice for the pharmacological management of human H5N1 virus infection in the current pandemic alert period. A transparent methodological guideline process on the basis of the Grading Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to develop evidence-based guidelines. Our development of specifi c recommendations for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of sporadic H5N1 infection resulted from the benefi ts, harms, burden, and cost of interventions in several patient and exposure groups. Overall, the quality of the underlying evidence for all recommendations was rated as very low because it was based on small case series of H5N1 patients, on extrapolation from preclinical studies, and high quality studies of seasonal infl uenza. A strong recommendation to treat H5N1 patients with oseltamivir was made in part because of the severity of the disease. Similarly, strong recommendations were made to use neuraminidase inhibitors as chemoprophylaxis in high-risk exposure populations. Emergence of other novel infl uenza A viral subtypes with pandemic potential, or changes in the pathogenicity of H5N1 virus strains, will require an update of these guidelines and WHO will be monitoring this closely.",

Rare cases of anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions were reported during post-marketing experience, and data from regulatory trials reported nausea and vomiting as the most frequent adverse event. 17, 18 Even allowing for the sparse direct evidence, most panel members judged that oseltamivir should be used as treatment and made a strong recommendation (recommendation 1; see below) following a vote (one abstention and one vote for a weak recommendation out of 13 panel members). It was noted that even small relative risk reductions could lead to large net benefi t in mortality. Recommended treatment regimens are shown in the table. There were no clinical data to recommend higher drug doses or more prolonged treatment, but the panel noted that two-fold higher doses did not provide greater antiviral or clinical eff ects in adults with uncomplicated seasonal infl uenza. 19, 20 Should H5N1 patients receive treatment with zanamivir?",

Primary (pretreatment) resistance appears to be common in clade 1 H5N1 virus isolated from human beings in Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia, 14, 15, 29 and resistance has occurred in some clade 2 H5N1 viruses, particularly those isolated in Indonesia. 14, 15, 29 Resistance has been found in H1N1 viruses from the preamantadine era. 30 Thus, amantadine or rimantadine do not off er greater net clinical benefi t as fi rst-line agents in the treatment of H5N1 infection compared with the neuraminidase inhibitors, and drug resistance is a major limitation.

However, oseltamivir has shown large eff ects on infl uenza incidence as post-exposure chemoprophylaxis for seasonal infl uenza and is active as pre-exposure prophylaxis in animal models of H5N1 infection. 21 Oselta mivir might eff ectively provide an important reduction in H5N1 virus transmission. The panel, therefore, recom mended that chemoprophylaxis courses should begin as soon as possible after exposure status is known and be used continuously for 7-10 days after the last known exposure (recommendations 8 to 11), but the strength of the recommendation diff ers by risk group.",

Because these recommendations were developed in the context of the current pandemic alert period without sustained human-to-human transmission, extrapolation to stockpiling decisions related to pandemic preparedness is limited, since diff erent criteria for judgment are likely to apply including changing estimates of benefi t and harm.",

The greatest barrier to implementation results from the limited availability of the neuraminidase inhibitors and the lack of resistance data. However, the clear description of the guiding principles of the panel's values and preferences will facilitate their application by clinicians treating H5N1 patients. In particular, weak recommendations will require careful evaluation of values and resources before they can be implemented. WHO will begin collecting feedback from user countries on the practicality of these guidelines. Emergence of novel human infl uenza A viral subtypes or a change in the pathogenicity or transmissibility of H5N1 virus strains, availability of new pharmacological agents, or important clinical research data on H5N1 will necessitate an update of these guidelines. In view of the potential for rapid change in the situation in relation to avian infl uenza, WHO will continue to monitor these factors carefully before deciding when to revise or update the recommendations.
