All 36 patients received a combination of corticosteroids and ribavirin. The patients were at risk of drug-related adverse reactions and deterioration of respiratory function, and nursing vigilance was required. Conclusion: Nursing patients with SARS was challenging as the disease was highly contagious and potentially lethal, and not much was known about this disease. In addition to the use of frontline treatment, infection control and sensitivity to individual responses to sudden and catastrophic illness were required to support these patients. From this outbreak of SARS, we have learned the importance of infection control in containing and controlling the disease. Other lessons included the need to strengthen the surge capacity in our hospitals and support health care workers during the crisis.",

The diagnosis of SARS was based on clinical, radiological and epidemiological features as outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO) 16 and Center for Disease Control (CDC) (US). 17 Very briefly, these patients had fever ( \u03fe 38\u00b0C), presence of respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea) and history of close contact with a suspected or confirmed SARS patient.

For example, all potentially aerosol-generating procedures were avoided. These included diagnostic sputum induction, endotracheal intubation, nasopharyngeal aspiration, and the use of nebulizer and nebulized medication. In cases where intubation and assisted mechanical ventilation were required, patients were transferred to the SARS ICU where negative pressure room and closed suction system were available to prevent air leaks. Since lapses in infection control (for example, using one's hand to adjust the mask or goggle, forgetting to wash hands after patient contact) were linked to heavy workload and failed attention span, special measures were taken to ensure that the staff were not over-worked. These included instituting a lower nursepatient ratio (1:4.5 for a 20-bedded SARS ward, 1:8 for a 30-bedded non SARS ward), providing more breaks while on duty, and scheduling a shorter working week. Nursing procedures, while essential for patient care, were also high-risk activities for nurses. In order to minimize the risk of prolonged exposure and extensive contact, a system of pairing up nurses, designed to improve efficiency and effectiveness, was instituted whenever nursing procedures were performed. To further reduce the risk of cross contamination, air-flow exchange cycle in SARS wards was increased from 7 to 11 per hour, beds were kept at 3 to 7 feet apart, and a distance of 3 feet was maintained between the patient and health care worker.",

In this cohort of patients, 20 (55.5%) of those with dyspnea had episodes of oxygen saturation of \u0545 94% on room air and required oxygen therapy. Two of the patients subsequently required ventilatory support and were transferred to the intensive care unit. Observations for adverse reactions to corticosteroids such as hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hypertension, edema, gastro-intestinal irritation, and depression were critical; hence the need to regularly monitor the patient's weight, blood pressure, serum electrolyte levels and blood glucose. It was important, too, for nurses to observe for failure to respond to treatment (displayed as persistent fever or dyspnea), or relapses (ie, patient becoming febrile again after an interval of normal body temperatures). Where appropriate, patients who were health care workers were involved in the monitoring of their own condition in order to enhance their sense of control.",

However, whether prolonged contact would increase the viral load and cause nosocomial infection has not been subjected to scientific testing.

In addition, an infection control team should be set up in each hospital to enforce the precautionary measures, monitor staff compliance and identify areas for improvement. Also, each incident of breakthrough infection must be investigated immediately and thoroughly to find the cause.

At present, the patients are being followed up weekly after discharge in order to monitor their physical condition. To the best of our knowledge, there are no provisions to rehabilitate these patients, even though many of them believe they have experienced the worst ordeal in their life. Nurses are in close contact with these patients when they return for their follow-up visits, and are in an excellent position to assess, plan, implement and evaluate a comprehensive model of physical-psycho-social-spiritual care.

The valuable lessons learned during this crisis should not be forgotten and should indeed be the basis for strategic planning for future similar events. Among the lessons learned, the most obvious one is the importance of infection control. This was most acutely felt in the beginning of the outbreak when so little was known about the disease and health professionals had to resort to control tools (isolation and quarantine) dating back to the earliest days of empirical microbiology. 23 In the battle against SARS, we have learned that infection control is broader than just having standards and guidelines in place or having the provision of personal protective equipment. It encompasses surveillance, infrastructure and staff training. In the USA, the CDC has already shown that hospitals that conduct ongoing surveillance on nosocomial infections have a significantly lower infection rate than those without such programs.",

An administrative infrastructure with the establishment of a hospital-wide Infection Control Committee with proper support (Infection Control Officers, space, computers and clerical support) is also essential to contain the spread of SARS. Since such an infrastructure cannot be built in a day, health authorities should make a concerted effort to establish it before the next outbreak of SARS or other similar catastrophes. Any effort at instituting infection control is futile without the support of health professionals who have received formal training in infection control. Although staff education may appear to be costly, the reduction in the spread of SARS, as well as other communicable diseases and infections, would more than pay for the education program.",
