This highly infectious disease has spread through 32 countries, infecting more than 8,400 patients with over 790 deaths in just over 6 months. Over one quarter of those infected were unsuspecting healthcare workers. The major transmission mode of SARS-coronavirus appears to be through droplet spread with other minor subsidiary modes of transmission such as close contact and fomites although air borne transmission has not been ruled out. There is as yet no definitive treatment protocol. Although the peak period of the outbreak is likely to have passed and the risk of SARS in the UK is therefore assessed to be low, the World Health Organisation has asked all countries to remain vigilant lest SARS re-emerges. Recent laboratory acquired cases of SARS reported from Taiwan and Beijing, China are a testimony to this risk. Until reliable diagnostic tests, vaccine and medications are available, control of SARS outbreaks depends on close surveillance, early identification of index cases, quick isolation of carriers and effective infection control and public health measures.",

This novel disease entity, termed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), is an atypical pneumonia that is likely to have originated in the Guang-dong province of Southern China in the fall of 2002. 1, 2 As of August 2003 more than 8,400 SARS cases and 916 deaths have been reported worldwide from 32 countries. 3 The brunt of the disease has thus far been borne by the East, especially China (including Hong Kong) and Singapore whilst the West, except for Canada, still remains relatively unscathed with only sporadic infections brought home by travellers to affected areas. During this period the UK had a total of four probable cases, one of which had a confirmed exposure to the SARS coronavirus. All four had fully recovered and there was no secondary spread. 4 The World Health Organisation (WHO) has announced recently that the peak period of the outbreak is likely to have passed and the associated dwindling in the morbidity and mortality rates is a testimony to this. In countries like the UK the risk of SARS is therefore assessed to be low. However, WHO has asked all countries to remain vigilant. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) of the UK also advised that the situation in the UK may have to be re-assessed if SARS does re-emerge. 5 And indeed a confirmed case of SARS coronavirus infection was reported in Singapore as recently as September 2003 although the infection was transmitted through laboratory contamination and not via the community. 6 We provide in Part I of this paper a brief account of the epidemiology, virology and clinical features of SARS, the general infection control measures and public health concerns. Part II will provide a detailed account of infection control measures that may be applied in the general dental practice, especially in the SARS-affected areas. There is a virtual explosion of knowledge on SARS, the virus, the clinical features of \u2022 SARS is a highly infectious and rapidly progressive form of atypical pneumonia caused by a newly identified strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV). \u2022 Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, epidemiology and exclusion from other pneumonias and is confirmed by a positive seroconversion. There is as yet no definitive treatment protocol. \u2022 Symptoms may be similar to other less infective or morbid diseases and over one quarter of those affected have been unsuspecting healthcare workers. \u2022 HCW must be familiar with the clinical features and case definitions of SARS to assist in the screening of the disease and prevention of spread. \u2022 Surveillance for possible SARS is recommended and control of the epidemic depends on early identification and isolation of carriers and effective infection control and public health measures.",

Its unique genetic composition has led to its categorisation into a separate group, for instance from those that cause common cold in humans and other, animal coronaviruses (eg murine and avian). Structurally, it is an enveloped, single stranded RNA (80-100 nm) virus covered by spike-like projections, resembling a crown, when viewed electron microscopically, hence its name. 11 Although the genome organization of SARS-CoV is similar to that of other coronaviruses, they are not closely related. 12 In one study RNA from the SARS-CoV was found in half of the nasopharyngeal specimens from SARS patients but in no specimens from 40 patients with other respiratory illnesses. 13 Rising antibody titres to the virus were noted in all 32 SARS patients from whom second serum specimens were obtained. Viral RNA was found in 10 of 18 faecal samples from SARS patients. Further, a SARS-like disease has been reproduced in monkeys through inoculation of the SARS-CoV. 10 Thus all of Koch's postulates (see Box 2) have been fulfilled with regard to the viral aetiology of SARS. Finally, and remarkably, within a short period of 3 months, the entire viral genome has been sequenced and is freely available for scientific use through the worldwide web.",
