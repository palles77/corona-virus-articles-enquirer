            "text": "In recent decades, many emerging infectious diseases have been occurring at an increasing scale and frequencyi.e. Ebola virus disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian and pandemic influenza, Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recently emerged coronavirus disease 2019 . The outbreaks of these diseases resulted in wide ranging socioeconomic consequences, including loss of lives and disruption to trade and travel. Preparedness is a crucial investment because its cost is small compared with the unmitigated impact of a health emergency. The financing gap for preparedness, estimated at US$4\u00b75 billion per year, is miniscule compared with estimated pandemic costs of $570 billion per year. 1,2 Within urban settings, preparedness activities have the added challenge of navigating a host of disruptive determinants that demand innovative solutions, especially the way in which diseases and their human hosts behave. 3 Ensuring that urban settings are prepared for emerging infectious diseases is crucially important. In 2018, 55% of the world's population (4\u00b72 billion people) resided in urban areas, and this proportion might increase to 68% by 2050. 4 Emerging infectious diseases also either originate in urban settings, such as the emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, or rapidly propagate because of urbanisation once they are established, such as outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and Zika virus disease in the Americas. [5] [6] [7] Many cities are important hubs of travel and trade; hence an uncontained outbreak would result in severe economic consequences beyond lives lost. More importantly, these urban centres risk becoming conduits of transmission to the world. As seen from the spread of COVID-19, diseases now follow major patterns of travel connections both domestically (with major cities in China connected by high speed rail) and internationally through flights. 8 For example, as of Feb 17, 2020, there were 172 exported cases of COVID-19 from China to 25 countries, with 156 secondary cases in 14 countries, and these were mostly in major cities with travel connections to China. 9 Urban settings have some common characteristics, many of which are disruptive factors that need to be addressed for effective preparedness. 3 For example,",

Inequalities, exacerbated by the rapid influx of people from rural areas, often results in poor housing, insufficient supply of fresh water, poor sanitation facilities, and ineffective ventilation systems, all of which increase outbreak risks. Rapid urbanisation might lead to encroachment into natural habitats and closer encounters with wildlife and zoonoses, and increased proximity to animals in backyard farms and food markets also provides opportunities for zoonotic infections. Both SARS and COVID-19 might have originated from food markets, and of the 335 emerging infectious diseases recognised between 1940 and 2004, more than 60% were of zoonotic origin. 10 Ensuring better preparedness in urban settings will require a fresh emphasis on strengthening capacities to deal with outbreaks and other health emergencies. Many of these efforts are applicable across all settings, urban or otherwise, such as having a good understanding of the local socioeconomic and cultural milieu and an active involvement of communities and local leaders in both planning and implementation. However, urban settings also offer new opportunities (table), such as securing the commitment of local leaders and strengthening public health networks to prevent, detect, and respond to disease threats early. Businesses can be appropriately engaged to manage employees in an emergency, and risk communication can be pushed through prevalent social media networks. Many lessons will also be learned from the city-wide community containment measures in Wuhan-the largest community quarantine exercise in history-and other containment measures rolled out in other Chinese cities and in Singapore.",
