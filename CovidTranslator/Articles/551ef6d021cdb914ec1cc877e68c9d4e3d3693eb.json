In the last 15 years, because of the strong market demand for buffalo cheese and as a consequence of the 'milk quotas' restriction imposed by the European Union, the number of buffaloes has increased in Italy. In Egypt, Iran and Azerbaijan also, there is a preference for buffalo dairy products compared to cows' milk products. During the 1990s, buffaloes have been imported to Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, where a few milk-producing herds can be found.",

Major morphological differences between the buffalo populations of different countries include: (1) the variable size, ranging between a minimum of 280 and 300 kg liveweight for adult females and males, respectively, in Egypt to a maximum of 900 and 1000 kg in Iraq, the most frequent weights being 600 and 800 kg; (2) the shape of the horns; and (3) the coat color, from dark-gray and dark-brown to black, showing white spots in some cases.",

Bulls in the breeding stations are provided by development programs of the government or other agencies. Due to difficulties in estrus detection and lack of organization, artificial insemination (AI) is still practiced only to a very limited extent for buffaloes in the Mediterranean region: in Italy for 2.5% of the buffaloes, in Egypt and Iran for 0.5% and in Romania for 0.1%. In the large cooperative and state farms in Bulgaria, AI is used on 80% of the buffaloes. In the other countries it is not used at all. The low use of AI has slowed down the implementation of national selection schemes for genetic improvement of milk productivity. Research trials conducted in Italy have indicated that artificial insemination is feasible and successful in buffaloes using the following technique to synchronize estrus and boost fertility. A progesteronereleasing intravaginal device (PRID) of silicon coils is inserted and left for 10 days; on the 7th day injections of 1000 IU of eCG (equine chorionic gonadotropin) and 15 mg of luprostiol (prostaglandin F 2 ) are given; artificial insemination is performed at 48, 72 and 96 h after removal of the PRID on day 10.",
