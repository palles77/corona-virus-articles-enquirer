The serially passaged virus interfered with the multiplication of the standard JHM virus, but not with vesicular stomatitis virus. After sucrose equilibrium centrifugation of high passage virus, a single peak contained both infectious virus and interfering activity. This virus population resembled the original JHM virus in its structural proteins, but it contained an increased proportion of a protein with a molecular weight of 65 X 10'. Genomic RNA from standard JHM virus contained a single species of RNA with a molecular weight of 5.4 X 106. After five undiluted passages, however, the virion population contained two RNA species with molecular weights of 5.4 X lo6 and 5.2 X 106. RNase Ti resistant oligonucleotide fingerprinting of these RNAs showed that the lower molecular weight RNA had lost several oligonucleotide spots that were present in the genomic RNA of the standard JHM virus. After several serial diluted passages of passage 10 virus, a single virus population was obtained which again had only standard virus RNA with a molecular weight of 5.4 X lo6 and lacked interfering activity. These results indicated that defective interfering particles were generated by serial undiluted passages of JHM virus. 9",

The oligonucleotide fingerprinting pattern of genomic RNA of passage 1 virus is almost identical to that reported by others. The numbering of oligonucleotides in this paper is therefore as described previously (Lai et al, 1981; Stohlman et cz& 1982) . However, three oligonucleotides (numbered as 2a, 2b, and 42a) appear not to be present in the previously reported fingerprints. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting of genomic RNA of passage 10 was essentially identical to that of passage 1 virus. However, an oli-gonucleotide (42b) (indicated by an arrow) appeared in the genomic RNA of passage 10 and an oligonucleotide, 42a, had disappeared (indicated as an open circle). The oligonucleotide fingerprinting of the lower MW RNA species of passage 10 virus showed the loss of nine oligonucleotides including 42a and 42b (indicated as open circles) and the appearance of three additional oligonucleotides (indicated by arrows). These studies clearly indicated that the lower MW RNA species had undergone deletions. Thus, these data strongly suggested that DI particles were present in culture fluids after passage 5.",

The reason for failure to detect the generation of DI particles of JHM virus in these experiments is unclear, but minor genetic differences might play some roles, because although the oligonucleotide fingerprinting pattern of our standard JHM virus was very similar to that reported by others (Lai and Stohlman, 1981) , some differences existed (see Fig. 5 ). During undiluted passages DI RNA was first detected at passage 5, and the virus yield was gradually reduced thereafter until passage 8, indicating that DI particles, generated at passages 4 to 5, accumulated in the culture and played a crucial role in the reduction of the infectivity. After reduction of the yield of infectious virus, fluctuating patterns of infectivity were observed. Such a phenomenon has been described in other viruses during passages without dilution (Holland et al, 1980; Huang and Baltimore, 1977) , indicating that the DI particles can replicate only with the aid of helper standard infectious virus and that the replication of the helper standard virus was inhibited by DI particles. The fluctuating pattern of infectivity has also been observed in the case of persistent infections with many viruses in tissue culture, in which DI particles have been detected.",

It is not possible to conclude, however, whether there is only a single, or multiple deletion ,sites.
