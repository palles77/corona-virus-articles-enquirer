Receptor binding by soluble tailspikes and the receptor-inactivating endorhamnosidase activity of the tailspike protein were studied using octa-and dodecasaccharides comprising two and three 0-antigen repeats of Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharides. Wild-type tailspike protein and three mutants (D392N, D395N, and E359Q) with defective endorhamnosidase activity were used. Oligosaccharide binding to all three subunits, measured by a tryptophan fluorescence quench or by fluorescence depolarization of a coumarin label attached to the reducing end of the dodecasaccharide, occurs independently. At 100C, the binding affinities of all four proteins to oligosaccharides from both bacterial strains are identical within experimental error, and the binding constants for octa-and dodecasaccharides are 1 x 106 M-1 and 2 x 106 M-1, proving that two 0-antigen repeats are sufficient for lipopolysaccharide recognition by the tailspike. Equilibration with the oligosaccharides occurs rapidly, but the endorhamnosidase produces only one cleavage every 100 s at 100C or about 2 min-1 at the bacterial growth temperature. Thus, movement of virions in the lipopolysaccharide layer before DNA injection may involve the release and rebinding of individual tailspikes rather than hydrolysis of the 0-antigen.",

Being an extracellular reaction, the attachment represents an ideal target for agents designed to interfere with the infection (Lentz, 1990) . However, very few structural and biophysical data on the interactions between viral adhesins and their host cell receptors are available. The major reason is that both reaction partners, the adhesin as a viral structural or envelope protein and the cellular receptor, a membrane protein, glycoprotein, or glycolipid, are usually insoluble and thus are hardly accessible to solution biophysical methods.",

P22 belongs to a large group of phages which, like many animal viruses, use surface carbohydrates as receptors. Its adhesin is the 215-kDa, homotrimeric tailspike protein. Up to six tailspikes are attached at one vertex of the P22 capsid ( Fig. 1 ), but three spikes may be sufficient to form an infectious particle (Israel, 1978) . The P22 tailspike recognizes the repetitive 0-antigen in the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide of (1 ->3)-a-D-galactose-(1-4) in common, but differ in the dideoxyhexose substituent at C-3 of the mannose (Fig. 1) .",

Receptor-inactivating enzymatic activities are common to polysaccharide-specific bacteriophages (Lindberg, 1977) and have been found in many carbohydrate-specific animal viruses, like influenza, paramyxo, and corona viruses. The 0-antigen polysaccharide forms a carbohydrate layer extending about 100 nm from the enterobacterial cell wall. Infection of Salmonella by phage P22 is thought to require not only penetration of the polysaccharide layer, but also a surface walk of the phage particle to reach a site suitable for injection of the phage DNA and accompanying proteins. The tailspike endorhamnosidase activity has been implicated in both processes (Lindberg, 1977; Bayer et al., 1980) . During normal infection, some excess tailspike accumulates as a soluble protein, and soluble tailspikes can be purified in large amounts from Salmonella infected by mutant P22 defective in capsid assembly and from Escherichia coli carrying a recombinant plasmid coding for the tailspike. P22 tailspike protein lacking its amino-terminal 108-residue head-binding domain is fully functional in carbohydrate binding and hydrolysis (Danner et al., 1993) . We have recently succeeded in crystallizing this N-terminally shortened tailspike protein, and its x-ray structure has been determined at 2.0 A resolution (Steinbacher et al., 1994) . Bacteriophage P22 recognizes lipopolysaccharide, its receptor at the surface of the bacterial host cell, with its tailspikes. The phage head binds six homotrimeric tailspikes, which are also accessible as soluble proteins (cf. Fig. 2 ). Associated with the tailspike protein is a receptorinactivating enzymatic activity, which cleaves the repetitive 0-antigen polysaccharide, the outer part of the lipopolysaccharide. The 0-antigens of Salmonella strains susceptible to phage P22 contain around 20 repeats of a common main-chain trisaccharide unit consisting of D-mannose, L-rhamnose (6-deoxymannose), and D-galactose. They differ in the dideoxyhexose (DDH) substituent at C-3 of the mannose, which is abequose (3,6-dideoxygalactose) in S. typhimurium, tyvelose (3,6-dideoxymannose) in S. enteritidis, and S. typhi and paratose (3,6-dideoxyglucose) in S. paratyphi. In addition, the S. typhi 0-antigen carries a glucose substituent at C-4 of the galactose that does not interfere with receptor binding and inactivation by the P22 tailspike. The cleavage site of the endorhamnosidase activity is indicated by the jagged arrow.",

The purpose of the present paper is a biophysical characterization of the interactions between such lipopolysaccharide fragments of defined length and the P22 tailspike endorhamnosidase. Using solution biophysical methods, we have measured binding affinities of native and of fluorescence-labeled octa-and dodecasaccharides from S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium to wild-type tailspike protein and to mutants with strongly reduced endorhamnosidase activity. We present a quantitative description of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by the tailspike protein and investigate three active-site carboxy-late residues suggested by the x-ray structure as critical in the enzymatic mechanism.",

            "text": "Previous biochemical assays for the enzymatic activity associated with bacteriophage tails relied on the liberation of radioactivity from labeled cell envelopes (Iwashita and Kanegasaki, 1976a; Svenson et al., 1979; Berget and Poteete, 1980) or on the determination of reducing ends produced by the glycosidic cleavage of partially purified Salmonella polysaccharide (Seckler et al., 1989; Danner et al., 1993) . Because we found such assays to be unsuitable for a quantitative analysis of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by the P22 tailspike protein and a characterization of the catalytic mechanism, we attempted to set up an endorhamnosidase assay based on a homogeneous substrate. The smallest substrate known to be efficiently cleaved by the enzyme, a dodecasaccharide fragment from Salmonella lipopolysaccharide purified by gel filtration chromatography (Weintraub et al., 1988) , was labeled at its reducing end by reductive amination with the fluorescent dye Amc, and the labeled oligosaccharide was purified by reversed-phase HPLC. Upon incubation with purified P22 tailspike protein, the labeled dodecasaccharide was efficiently cleaved into labeled tetrasaccharide and unlabeled octasaccharide, as identified by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography Endorhamnosidase activity of the wild-type protein For quantitative analysis of DodAmc cleavage, reversedphase HPLC with fluorescence detection was used (Fig. 3) . At a flow rate of 1 ml/min, the HPLC retention times of DodAmc, OctAmc, and TetAmc were 16.8 min, 17.5 min, and 18.1 min, respectively. Fig. 3 A shows the elution profiles of pure DodAmc and of a sample from a 15-min incubation at 10\u00b0C with purified wild-type protein. As the amino-terminal head-binding domain of the tailspike protein is dispensable for oligosaccharide binding and hydrolysis (Danner et al., 1993) , wild-type and point mutant proteins used in this study lack the N-terminal 108 residues that interfere with the crystallographic analysis (Steinbacher et al., 1994) . We have not detected any significant differences between full-length and N-terminally shortened proteins in the oligosaccharide hydrolysis and binding assays used. The HPLC peaks of DodAmc and TetAmc were very well separated and could be integrated independently. The fraction of TetAmc was calculated from the peak areas, and the rate of DodAmc hydrolysis was found to be nearly constant up to 10% total turnover (Fig. 3 B) . Rates determined at increasing substrate concentrations increased in a hyperbolic fashion, and a fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation yielded a KM of 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 ,uM and a turnover rate constant of kcat = 0.01 \u00b1 0.002 s-1 at 10\u00b0C (Fig. 3 C) . To achieve substrate saturation, the DodAmc concentration was kept above 25 X KD of the unlabeled dodecasaccharide measured at the respective temperature (cf. below). An Arrhenius plot of the rates measured under these conditions between 2\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C was close to linear and resulted in an activation energy of 35 5 kJ/mol.",

            "text": "Based on the x-ray structure of a S. enteritidis octasaccharide complexed to the wild-type protein (Steinbacher et al., manuscript submitted for publication), three candidate active-site carboxylates were selected for site-directed mutagenesis. These residues are Asp392, Asp395, and Glu359. They were replaced by the corresponding amides in the mutants D392N, D395N, and E359Q, respectively. Upon expression in E. coli, the mutant proteins folded efficiently and could be purified to homogeneity, as judged by gel electrophoresis with silver staining. None of the mutants showed detectable DodAmc hydrolysis at 10\u00b0C. At 37\u00b0C and a tailspike subunit concentration of 1.7 ,uM, significant turnover by the mutant proteins was detected after 1-4 days. Under these conditions, the wild-type protein hydrolyzes 10% of the DodAmc in less than 1 min. Because the mutants bind oligosaccharides with wild-type affinities (cf. below), their turnover numbers could be estimated directly from the observed TetAmc production. They are reduced to about 1/30,000 (D392N), 1/25,000 (D395N), and 1/10,000 (data not shown). (B) Time course of DodAmc hydrolysis by wild-type tailspike protein (0.5 ,tM subunits) at 10\u00b0C. The substrate concentration was 15 ,uM; the solid line represents a simulation assuming rapid equilibration with substrate and product, and using turnover number, substrate KM, and product dissociation constants determined in the present study. The simulation was done with KINSIM (Frieden, 1994 Oligosaccharide binding equilibria Upon addition of purified Salmonella 0-antigen fragments, the intrinsic fluorescence of the tailspike protein was significantly quenched and blue-shifted (Fig. 4 A) . At saturation, the reduction in fluorescence intensity was 19 \u00b1 1% for the wild-type and between 13% and 22% for the mutant proteins (Table 1 ). The fluorescence quench can be rationalized by two out of seven tryptophans of each tailspike subunit being located in the oligosaccharide binding site (Steinbacher et al., manuscript submitted for publication). Both tryptophans (residues 365 and 391) are highly solventexposed in the structure of the unliganded protein, and more exposed than any of the other tailspike tryptophans. Thus, quenching of emission from W365 and W391 by the bound oligosaccharide is expected to result in a blue shift concomitant with a reduction in intensity. The observed spectral change allowed us to determine the equilibrium constants for the binding of a number of oligosaccharides to wild-type and mutant tailspike proteins by fluorescence titrations. Example titrations for the wild-type protein with octasaccharides from S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis are presented in Fig. 4 B, together with a maltoheptaose control. As evident from the results of nonlinear regression represented by the solid lines, the titrations were well described by hyperbolic binding to a single class of binding sites. The dissociation constants for both octasaccharides (KD = 0.9 + 0.1 ,uM; cf. Table 1 ) were identical within experimental error. The binding affinities to Salmonella 0-antigen octa-and dodecasaccharide fragments, i.e., to product and substrate of the endorhamnosidase reaction, were measured for the mutant proteins E359Q, D392N, and D395N, which did not hydrolyze significant amounts of dodecasaccharide during the fluorescence titrations. All three mutants bound octasaccharides with wild-type affinity (Table 1) , whereas the dissociation constants of octasaccharide complexes with four other point mutants (E359G, W391G, V331A, V331G, data not shown) were 10-100-fold higher. Binding constants for the dodecasaccharides were twofold higher than those of the octasaccharides. Again, oligosaccharides from the two Salmonella species bound with equal affinity, and binding by the three mutants was not significantly different.",

            "text": "The interactions of the tailspike protein with Salmonella 0-antigen oligosaccharides at around 10\u00b0C can be summarized in a simple scheme: This model is based on results obtained with wild-type tailspike protein and with three mutant proteins that bind oligosaccharides with wild-type affinity but do not hydrolyze significant amounts over the time course of a binding titration. The binding equilibria for substrate and product are fast compared to the rate of hydrolysis. Equilibration with free oligosaccharide is observed in the dead time of manual mixing, and the KM for the labeled dodecasaccharide DodAmc in the endorhamnosidase reaction catalyzed by the wild type closely coincides with its KD determined by fluorescence depolarization with the D392N mutant. The general scheme also holds at the physiological temperature of around 35\u00b0C, although both dissociation constants and the catalytic rate are threeto fivefold higher. As the binding constants and their temperature dependence are similar for octa-and dodecasaccharides, the additional 0-antigen repeating unit in the dodecasaccharide appears to contribute little to the interactions. This is consistent with the observation that the binding free energy of DodAmc is reduced by less than 1 kcal/mol, although the pyranose ring at the reducing end of the dodecasaccharide is broken and a bulky fluorescence label is added by the chemical modification. Oligosaccharides from S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium, in which the side-chain dideoxyhexoses are tyvelose (3,6-dideoxymannose) and abequose (3,6dideoxygalactose), bind to the tailspike with essentially identical affinities, in agreement with the two Salmonella species being equally susceptible to infection by bacteriophage P22 (Eriksson et al., 1979) . The temperature dependence of the equilibrium constants indicates a large negative heat capacity change upon oligosaccharide binding. Compared to literature values for the binding of monosacccharides to proteins, this value appears unusual, but large heat capacity changes on the order observed here have been reported for the binding of oligosaccharides to antibodies (Zidovetzki et al., 1988; Sigurskjold and Bundle, 1992) . A negative heat capacity change is usually taken to indicate a significant reduction of exposed hydrophobic surface area. Accordingly, the large heat capacity change observed for the tailspike-oligosaccharide interaction (1-2 kJ mol-1K-I; compare Spolar and Record, 1994) (Steinbacher et al., manuscript submitted for publication). Although wild-type and D392N mutant tailspikes bind octasaccharide and dodecasaccharide with essentially identical affinities at 10\u00b0C, differences above experimental error were observed between the two proteins in the van't Hoff enthalpies of octasaccharide binding and their temperature dependencies. There is no obvious explanation for this result, and further studies by titration calorimetry and x-ray crystallography will be required to resolve this apparent difference in the mode of binding. Compared to other endoglycosidases, the P22 tailspike endorhamnosidase has a remarkably low turnover number but a high substrate binding affinity. This may have been expected, as the principal function of the tailspike protein is to attach the bacteriophage to its host's cell surface. Although the bacteriophage particle holds six tailspike trimers, each of which can bind three oligosaccharides, only three or four binding sites appear to be used simultaneously (Israel, 1978) . Nevertheless, the observed binding free energies of close to 30 kJ/mol for each site at physiological temperature add up to essentially irreversible attachment. Rapid release and rebinding of individual tailspikes to pairs of 0-antigen repeats may prevent the phage from becoming stuck at unproductive sites, i.e., locations not suitable for DNA injection.",

Endoglycosidase activities of bacteriophage tail particles have been assumed to be required for the lateral movement of phage particles to a DNA injection site or to clear a path through the lipopolysaccharide layer down to the outer membrane of the bacterium (Lindberg, 1977; Bayer et al., 1980) . For P22, lateral movement is more likely to occur through receptor relase and rebinding than by its hydrolysis. Phage attachment and DNA uptake require only seconds to very few minutes at physiological temperature, during which the enzymatic activity would hardly be sufficient to cut a clearing into the lipopolysaccharide jungle. Furthermore, the tail structures of S. anatum bacteriophage g34, are associated with an esterase activity capable of inactivating, but not physically shortening, the receptor 0-antigen (Iwashita and Kanegasaki, 1976b; Bayer et al., 1980) . On the other hand, the receptor-inactivating activities of carbohydrate-specific bacteriophages may be required upon completion of an infectious cycle for detachment of newly assembled viral particles from the host cell debris. Recent studies on the neuraminidases and esterases of influenza viruses indicate that these analogs of the P22 tailspike endorhamnosidase activity, in fact, facilitate the release of viral particles into the supernatant and are dispensible for viral entry (Herrler et al., 1992; Liu et al., 1995; Huberman et al., 1995) .",

Experimental support for the oligosaccharide contacts to both W365 and W391 being responsible for the fluorescence change comes from the fact that the fluorescence quench upon oligosaccharide binding to a mutant that lacks Trp391 is reduced to about half the amplitude observed for the wild type (B. Schuler and R. Seckler, unpublished data). All seven of the tryptophan residues of the tailspike protein are partially accessible to solvent, but W365 and W391 are among the least buried.

The 0-antigens of Salmonella strains susceptible to phage P22 contain around 20 repeats of a common main-chain trisaccharide unit consisting of D-mannose, L-rhamnose (6-deoxymannose), and D-galactose. They differ in the dideoxyhexose (DDH) substituent at C-3 of the mannose, which is abequose (3,6-dideoxygalactose) in S. typhimurium, tyvelose (3,6-dideoxymannose) in S. enteritidis, and S. typhi and paratose (3,6-dideoxyglucose) in S. paratyphi.
