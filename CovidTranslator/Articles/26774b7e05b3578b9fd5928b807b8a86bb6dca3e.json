The goals of the conferences are to encourage a better understanding of health and medicine, The self-healing capacities of people play a central role in this approach. The third conference was held in October 1996 (Zichron Yaacov, Mount of Carmel) on the 'Potentiating Health and the Crisis of the Immune System'. The organizers stressed that 'The world is an era of integration, synthesis, better understanding and willingness to listen. There is a new potential to cooperative politically, socially and in the most important areas of health and medicine. Currently, there is a tremendous interest in potentiating health. Yet, this is far from being achieved. The list of today's modern sicknesses is long: disordered immunity and resistance, chronic diseases (mainly rheumatic problems, multiple sclerosis), allergy, asthma, eczema, cancer and AIDS. Since most conventional methods have failed to prevent and/or treat these health problems, new approaches are required. These approaches will integrate conventional and alternative techniques, inspired by a more compassionate and holistic view of the human being, nature and our planet. The issue of stress, mind-body health, ' An impression of the Third Dead Sea Conference, October 20-24, 1996, Zichron Yaacov, Israel. vitality and energy of diet and lifestyle, as well as self-care and health education, should be our major concerns' [l] .

Indeed, when we look beneath the surface there is much to be learnt from the signs and symptoms which both patient and carer, a clear picture as to the direction taken. We are, as humans, more than just our physical body. We possess a very powerful mind with instincts, emotions, logic and intuition integrated with our essential spirit. Physical illness often occurs in response to a deeper impulse from within urging the individual to change or consideration of their actions. By understanding the subtle energies, especially in relation to the chakra system, it is possible to recognize the links between personality and illness, and illness and soul growth there by enhancing the potential of the experience. In her contribution she presented a review of the psychosomatics of several diseases, emphasizing the important spiritual: impulses emotional expression, autonomy in the self-healing capacities of men and women. She concluded the preventive medicine cannot occur until all health care professionals acknowledge the power and the effect of the mind, body and spirit when they function in harmony.

            "text": "Stephen Fulder (Israel) reviewed 'The health consequences of competing conventional and alternative definitions of health'. He stated in his abstract 'Health and resistance to disease are not often defined. They are relatively invisible concepts implicit in medicine. Conventional medicine has an operational definition of health as lack of obvious pathological symptoms. This can lead to a frustrating lack of interest in health and its manifestations. It can have drastic effects on our experience of illness and health. An utopian definition is sometimes used, such as by the World Health Organization, but it has no practical outcomes'. He described other views on health as a response to the extremely mechanistic view of the human being within modern medicine. They all have major effects on our health. For example the perspective of symptoms theory and the salutogenic concepts of Antonovsky reduces the power of the individual human being to protect his health, and gives responsibility to society and its institutions for health problems. This has led to health promotion schemes, which have had disappointing results. Alternative medicine involves a rich and ancient source of experience into the nature of health and human resistance to disease. Most alternative therapies i Patient Education and Counseling .30 (1997) 201-208 203 see the individual and his life's journey as the key to health or sickness. They acknowledge that health is essentially a mystery, like life itself, but that there are ways to life, and to seek treatment, which can increase our resistance, our health and our well-being. The alternative therapies imply an open-ended.tiew of health, stating that it is defined only in relation to the context of that individual at that moment. There is a belief in the natural will to be well, the self-healing powers, which are affirmed and supported. There is usually a more 'natural' or unfabricated orientation, with less confidence in drastic and unsafe treatments, and less intervention, i.e. more respect for the integrity and experience of the human being. These views are essentially vitalistic, and as such run counter to the mechanistic world view of modern life. This can create a real struggle for patients, and nowhere is this better illustrated than in the prevention of chronic diseases. For example a mechanistic orientation to cancer prevention can lead to fitness obsessions and the consumption of vitamins. A vitalistic orientation, in contrast, will lead to the direction of an harmonious and balanced life. In any treatment the same conflict can emerge. Alternative medicine itself can be mechanistic for example in formula acupuncture or 'quick-fix' chiropractic, and as such unsatisfying to many patients. It is very helpful to expose and explore these underlying themes, so that both patients and practitioners learn more deeply the basis of the various ways on offer at present to prevent and treat disease [4] .",

He stated that 'Conventional Medicine is now facing a critical stage in its development, with the growing awareness of its shortcomings, despite the tremendous technical and scientific achievements it has gained. The remarkable success of the technological disciplines, particularly in the area of diagnosis, the fantastic developments, especially in the intervention surgical disciplines, and the new fast developing scientific fields, such as that of molecular biology, are all testimony for the tremendous progression biomedical sciences have made. And yet, as an indicator for the shortcomings, a growing proportion of the population in all western countries, seek the help of alternative-complemental medicine, in solving various health problems that have not been solved by regular medicine. Several reasons may account for this striking discrepancy between the tremendous scientific achievements on the one hand and the public dissatisfaction, on the other hand. The most important reason being the neglect of the human aspect of disease and alienation of the medical systems, and the chronic nature of diseases most common in the affluent societies of the west. The continuous growth of the complex and huge medical centers, as best representatives of modern medicine, has not helped to overcome these shortcomings. This phase in the development of conventional medicine should therefore be viewed as a phase of true challenge and possible change of direction. Complementary medicine presents one aspect of this challenge: (1) It presents empirical claims that need to be substantiated by regular clinical investigation. (2) It opens up questions of unrecognized and undefined mechanisms of disease not properly and seriously dealt with before scientifically. (3) It raises the issue of mind body interactions as a central factor in disease. (4) It presents concrete examples for a better doctorpatient relationship. These challenges should be met and special efforts to make the most of them should be encouraged. Conventional medicine should try to integrate as much as possible from complementary approaches including some of the more distant philosophies behind these disciplines'.",

Patients recently diagnosed with cancer, who have the primary tumor surgically removed, and who have not had either radiation or chemotherapy, respond particularly well. It may also be used prophylactically-in persons whose cancers have been treated with success in the past but who are concerned about relapse. A few cases were presented about the affectivity of this approach in cancer treatment.",

Its immunological profile is similar to interleukin 2 and gamma interferon. Met-enkephalin specifically increases numbers of cytotoxic cells (CD8 and NK) that are effective against viruses and tumors. Antivial activity was demonstrated against Herpes, AIDS, CMV, coronavirus, FluA, and Japanese Encephalitis either alone or in combination with known anti-virals. Anti-tumor activity was seen against melanoma, sarcoma, lung cancer, colon, leukemia, and neuroblastoma. Clinical studies in AIDS and cancer patients were discussed'.",

She described in her abstract that human beings are born with a functioning yet immature immune system already in place. Several influences around the time of birth will enhance or weaken it. The genetic influence of the parents and ancestors is a given, and not under their control. Influences that are under a reasonable amount of control include the basic health of the parents as a result of their diet and the use (or non-use) of drugs and alcohol. During pregnancy, the mother's diet and use (or non-use) of drugs and alcohol will more specifically affects the fetus. The type of birth experience, natural or with drugs, vaginal or caesarean, will affect the child's central nervous system. Perhaps the most important early immune enhancer is breast-feeding and specifically the infant's intake of colostrum; the symbiotic feedback loop between mother and infant sets up the basic working of the immune system for life, Therefore, a history of bottle feeding may indicate a priori a weaker immune system. It is the suggestion that health professionals always inquire if their clients have been breast or bottle fed, and long of each. Three other influences upon the immune system were discussed: (a) the infant's diet once solid are introduced; (b) the use of antibiotics: (c) the use of vaccins.",

Results were reported on the intervention and psychosocial determinants studies on: breast cancer, cervical cancer, melanoma and prostate cancer. The studies are based on a stressor-support-coping model, developed in cooperation with researchers at the University of Miami (USA).

The so called crisis of the immune system did not get much attention. Is there a general crisis? In which populations. 3 How to measure? So, several unanswered questions. Immunology seems to be a metaphor in the new-aged engaged health care providers. There is still a big gap between integrate approaches using the human (self) healing potention and its measurable effects in immune functioning as well as the course of diseases. Due to this gap, there is a strong need for education and counseling on the integrative approaches to prevention and healing in modern diseases.",
