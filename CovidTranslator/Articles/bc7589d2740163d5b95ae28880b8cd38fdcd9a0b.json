This subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) develops weeks to months after viral inoculation and is characterized neuropathologically by primary demyelination in the brain and the spinal cord and by inflammatory changes consisting mainly of infiltration by macrophages and lymphocytes with perivascular cuffing in the vicinity of plaques. During the clinical disease, the virus can be isolated from the brain and the spinal cord tissue and viral antigens are detectable. predominantly in the glial cells (Nagashima et al. 1978 , 1979 : Sorensen et al. 1980 : Koga et al. 1984 . Rats surviving this disease recover, but ma~' develop a relapse of SDE with fresh demyelinating lesions, weeks to months after the first attack (Wege et al. 1984a) . Moreover, during the course of SDE sensitization of lymphocytes to myelin basic protein (MBP) occurs, suggesting that an immunopathological reaction to brain antigens contributes to the development of this demyelinating disease (Watanabe et al. 1983) .",

            "text": "The observation of a virus-induced cell-mediated immune reaction (CMI) to a host antigen in the course of a coronavirus infection of the brain has raised a question about the humoral immune reactions in the CNS during SDE. It has been shown, especially in man, that in other acute and chronic viral infections of the brain, antiviral antibodies are synthesized intrathecally by a limited number of cell clones thus leading to a characteristic electrophoretic pattern with restricted heterogeneity of immunoglobulins. These antibodies are predominantly directed against the causative agent but also against other viral antigens which are not involved in the pathogenetic process (Vandvik et al. 1976 , 1978a , b: Nordal et al. 1978 : Skorr et al. 1981 : Vartdal et al. 1982 . Therefore, in the current study we collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood from SDE animals and analysed it for JHM antibodies and for the presence of restricted heterogeneity in the immunoglobulins. To our surprise, many of SDE animals studied did not reveal an intrathecal JHM immune response despite the presence of viral antigens in the CNS tissue. Other animals showed an oligoclonal pattern of CSF Ig, the specificity of which was not determined. These findings suggest that in SDE induced in rats by coronavirus, humoral antiviral immune response does not contribute directly to the disease. Perhaps the absence of viral antibodies allows the spread of the infection and permits the development of cell-mediated immunity to host antigens. Whether or not the immune response in the CSF of some of these animals is due to autoantibodies, is not yet known.",

Due to a shortage of CSF, this analysis could only be completed for 8/12 animals. Only 3 rats (G826, G4232, G4263) exhibited virus-specific Ig in the CSF but not in the corresponding serum specimen. Typical results of this technique are given in Fig. 2 which demonstrates the isoelectric pattern of total and JHMspecific Ig in CSF and serum samples of animal No. G4263. In the CSF an oligoclonal distribution of total Ig towards the cathodic part of the gradient can be seen beside a polyclonal pattern at the neutral pH. However, only part of the total CSF Ig shows a virus-specific activity.

Although one of these animals (G4263) did reveal significant BBB dysfunction which may contribute to the increased specific antibody index, we do not believe that the BBB disturbance alone explains this finding. The increase of the albumin CSF/serum ratio of the diseased animal as compared to the control JHM hyperimmunized animal (N22) increase in CSF/serum ratio of JHM antibody titer is 250-fold.

It is interesting that clinical disease in these two animals had an unusually long incubation period, suggesting that changes in the BBB may be detectable only within a certain time after the inoculation of the virus. The proportion of animals with increased CSF/serum Ig ratios approximately one month after inoculation of the virus is high. This suggested to us that intrathecal Ig synthesis may be an important marker of the disease.

This interpretation was further supported by the calculation of JHM-specific antibody indices in the CSF specimens of animals with SDE and without CNS disease but hyperimmunized with different antigens intraperitoneally. Antibody indices of diseased animals were significantly higher than those of non-diseased animals, a fact that supported the view that JHM-specific antibodies in the CSF are a result of intrathecal synthesis.

This is in contrast to other subacute viral infections of the central nervous system, such as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) or progressive rubella panencephalitis, in which measles or rubella virus antibodies are found in the CSF of each patient (Johnson 1982) . Thirdly, electrophoretic distribution of virus-specific Ig exhibited an oligoclonal pattern of a broader pH range than that observed in viral CNS infections in men. This phenomenon cannot be interpreted at present since no comparable data from other animal models are available. Perhaps antibodies synthesized intrathecally as a response to viral antigen in rats do not focus as cathodic, unlike in men. Fourthly, there was no correlation between increased total Ig in the CSF and the presence of virus-specific antibodies. This observation supports the interpretation that viral antigens are not the only ones that can evoke a local humoral immune response; non-viral antigens can also cause intrathecal Ig synthesis. Moreover, the presence of virus-specific antibodies in the CSF with a normal Ig concentration shows clearly that intrathecal virus-specific Ig is not necessarily reflected in an increased total Ig concentration. A similar observation has been made in human mumps meningitis, in which mumps-specific IgG titers in the CSF are not always accompanied by an increased IgG concentration in CSF Ukkonen et al. 1981) . It seems that, either the contribution of virus-specific antibodies to the total Ig concentration in the CSF is low, or virus-specific immunoglobulin replaces non-viral immunoglobulins in the CSF.",
