            "text": "Infections caused by Fasciola hepatica are of great importance in the veterinary field, as they cause important economic losses to livestock producers. Serodiagnostic methods, typically ELISA (with either native or recombinant antigens), are often used for early diagnosis. The use of native antigens, as in the MM3-SERO ELISA (commercialized as BIO K 211, BIO-X Diagnostics), continues to be beneficial in terms of sensitivity and specificity; however, there is interest in developing ELISA tests based on recombinant antigens to avoid the need to culture parasites. Of the antigens secreted by adult flukes, recombinant procathepsin L1 (rFhpCL1) is the most commonly tested in ELISA to date. However, although adult flukes produce three different clades of CLs (FhCL1, FhCL2, and FhCL5), to our knowledge, the diagnostic value of recombinant FhCL2 and FhCL5 has not yet been investigated. In the present study, we developed and tested three indirect ELISAs using rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, and rFhpCL5 and evaluated their recognition by sera from sheep and cattle naturally infected with F. hepatica. Although the overall antibody response to these three rFhpCLs was similar, some animals displayed preferential recognition for particular rFhpCLs. Moreover, for cattle sera, the highest sensitivity was obtained using rFhpCL2 (97%), being equal for both rFhpCL1 and rFhpCL5 (87.9%), after adjusting cut-offs for maximum specificity. By contrast, for sheep sera, the sensitivity was 100% for the three rFhpCLs. Finally, the presence of truncated and/or partially unfolded molecules in antigen preparations is postulated as a possible source of cross-reactivity.",

The genus Fasciola includes two species, F. hepatica and F. gigantica, the former of which is distributed worldwide and the second of which is restricted to several regions of Africa and Asia ). The broad distribution of F. hepatica seems to be associated with its ability to adapt to new definitive hosts and with its capacity to infect different snail species (intermediate hosts) living in diverse habitats and under different environmental conditions (Correa et al. 2010) .",

Finally, the parasites move into biliary ducts where they mature and begin producing eggs. Nevertheless, sometimes a small proportion of parasites reaches ectopic locations (Mas-Section Editor: Xing-Quan Zhu * Florencio M. Ubeira fm.ubeira@usc.es Coma et al. 2013 Coma et al. , 2014 , thus preventing elimination of the eggs through the biliary ducts. Considering the characteristics of the biological cycle of Fasciola, diagnosis of infections by either F. hepatica or the more pathogenic F. gigantica (Valero et al. 2016) has traditionally been carried out by microscopic observation of parasite eggs in fecal samples from infected hosts (Mas-Coma et al. 2014 ). However, these methods are tedious, have poor sensitivity, and depend to a greater or lesser degree on the experience of the examiner. Moreover, fecal examination cannot detect acute infections when the parasites feed on liver parenchyma, before egg production has started (Charlier et al. 2014; Mas-Coma et al. 2014 ).",

            "text": "In the past two decades, considerable effort has been made to develop rational ELISA methods for the diagnosis of human and animal infections caused by F. hepatica and F. gigantica in order to prevent the limitations inherent in microscopic examination of fecal samples (Espino and Dumenigo 2003) . Such methods include the use of whole or purified natural antigens from Fasciola as well as recombinant antigens, to detect anti-Fasciola circulating antibodies (Cornelissen et al. 1999; Carnevale et al. 2001b; Espinoza et al. 2007; Mezo et al. 2007; Gonzales Santana et al. 2013; Gottstein et al. 2014) . They also include ELISA methods capable of detecting secreted antigens present in serum or fecal samples from infected humans and animals (Espino and Finlay 1994; Abdel-Rahman et al. 1998; Mezo et al. 2004; Ubeira et al., 2009; George et al., 2017) . Because antibody titers may remain elevated for long periods of time after treatment of the infection, ELISA methods for the detection of specific antibodies cannot distinguish between current or past infections. Nevertheless, these ELISAs offer the advantage of being able to diagnose early prepatent (acute) infections (Salimi-Bejestani et al. 2007; Mezo et al. 2010a,b; Mas-Coma et al. 2014) , and, for this reason, they are frequently used to screen herds of domestic animals in serum and mostly in milk samples (Mezo et al. 2010b; Duscher et al. 2011; Mezo et al. 2011 ). Most of these methods are indirect or capture ELISAs that include Fasciola cathepsins L (CLs) as antibody targets, as these antigens probably induce the highest proportion of anti-Fasciola antibodies during natural infections. However, except for ELISAs based on the use of single recombinant CLs (rCLs) or recombinant procathepsins L (rpCLs), typically L1 clade members, the suitability of each of the several cathepsins secreted by Fasciola for detecting anti-Fasciola antibodies by ELISA has not previously been investigated. This aspect is relevant, as it has been reported that the pattern of cathepsins that are secreted by F. hepatica varies during its biological cycle, so that immature parasites begin producing FhCL3, FhCL4, and cathepsins B, but that expression is gradually replaced by FhCL1, FhCL2, and FhCL5 in adults (Robinson et al. 2008; Smooker et al. 2010; Cwiklinski et al. 2015) . Moreover, production of these FhCLs by adult flukes has been reported to be imbalanced, with proportions of 69, 22 and 9% for FhCL1, FhCL2, and FhCL5, respectively ). It is therefore important to determine which of these molecules are most relevant from the point of view of their antigenicity and suitability as target antigens for serodiagnosis of human and animal infections by Fasciola. In the present study, we developed and tested indirect ELISAs based on recombinant procathepsin L1 (rFhpCL1), rFhpCL2, or rFhpCL5, in order to investigate which of these targets are best recognized by sera from sheep and cattle naturally infected with F. hepatica. We also evaluated if any of these rFhpCLs is advantageous over the use of native CLs using as reference method of this study the MM3-SERO ELISA, in which the monoclonal antibody (mAb) MM3 captures native Fasciola CLs (Mezo et al. 2007 ).",

At each visit, 15 adult cows (over 2 years old; Friesian breed, females) were selected at random, and their livers as well as stool and blood samples were collected and transported to the laboratory promptly. In total, samples from 100 naturally F. hepatica-infected and 200 F. hepatica-free adult cattle, as determined, respectively, by the presence or the absence of flukes in livers (gold standard), were collected. For recovering and counting all flukes, each liver was thoroughly examined. In the first step, we proceeded to the opening of the bile ducts and the gallbladder to obtain the most of intact adult flukes and then the livers were cut into slices (approximately 1 cm thick) which were manually squeezed to obtain the immature flukes inhabiting the parenchyma. This procedure prevented any possible problems of low sensitivity when liver inspection is not performed thoroughly, as has been described in previous studies (Rapsch et al. 2006; Charlier et al. 2008) .",

The alignments revealed a high percentage of sequence identity among the three FhpCLs, although the percentage of identity was higher between FhpCL1 and FhpCL5 (87%), in comparison with the 84% calculated for FhpCL2 and FhpCL5, and the 78% for FhpCL1 and FhpCL2.

As indicated in the previous section, the optimal concentration of the target antigens was determined in ELISA plates by their recognition by mAb MM3, which binds to an epitope that is present in the three FhCL clades. Moreover, as the MM3 epitope is conformational in nature , their recognition by this mAb in ELISA strongly suggests correct folding of these recombinant molecules. The results presented in Fig. 2a (Fasciola-infected) and Fig. 2b (Fasciola-free) show the individual IgG antibody response of the 33 and 22 cows, respectively, to the three recombinant cathepsins in indirect ELISA, and to native cathepsins in capture ELISA (MM3-SERO). Most of the sera from Fasciolainfected cows produced OD signals higher than 0.5 to the three rFhpCLs although, considering the samples individually, the antibodies in some sera displayed a preference for certain rFhpCLs. For example, this was the case with serum #5, which reacted preferentially with rFhpCL5 and rFhpCL1, and serum #15 which produced the highest OD value with rFhpCL2. Finally, only two serum samples (#14 and #29) produced low responses with \u2264 0.25 OD (Fig. 2a) . With respect to sera from Fasciola-free cattle (Fig. 2b) , unlike for the ELISA MM3-SERO, several serum samples produced high backgrounds in indirect ELISA, with OD values \u2265 0.1. The highest background values were obtained with rFhpCL1 (sera #10, #17, and #19) and with rFhpCL5 (sera #10, #15, and #21), although one sample (serum #22) also produced a considerable background (OD > 0.2) with rFhpCL2.",

Regarding infected sheep, the response to the three recombinant antigens follows the same pattern as indicated above for cattle, with good ELISA signals and only one sample yielding an OD signal Diagnostic value of the indirect ELISA with rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, or rFhpCL5 versus the MM3-SERO capture ELISA For a better comparison of the signals obtained in indirect ELISA with rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, and rFhpCL5 with those of the classical MM3-SERO ELISA, we elaborated a graph grouping the response given by each individual serum in each of the four ELISAs tested (Fig. 4a, b) . In these figures, the corresponding cut-offs, calculated as the maximum OD value from negative sera plus one SD (method A) or obtained by ROC analysis (method B) are represented, respectively, by horizontal dashed red and blue lines. The sera from infected cattle produced similar mean OD signals (p > 0.05 for all comparisons), ranging from OD = 0.177 to OD = 2.398 for rFhpCL1-ELISA, from OD = 0.192 to OD = 2.268 for rFhpCL2-ELISA, from OD = 0.186 to OD = 2.673 for rFhpCL5-ELISA, and from OD = 0.254 to OD = 2.238 for MM3-SERO ELISA (Fig. 4a ). However, due to the big differences observed between the cut-off of the reference test MM3-SERO ELISA (OD = 0.043) and the calculated cut-offs for the indirect ELISAs (OD = 0.632, 0.310, and 0.597, respectively, with method A, and 0.265, 0.265, and 0.285, respectively, with method B) several positive sera were incorrectly classified by these latter. Specifically, n = 4, n = 1, and n = 4 sera from infected cattle were misclassified by rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, and rFhpCL5 ELISAs, respectively, considering the cut-off obtained by method A, while n = 2, n = 1, and n = 2 of these sera were incorrectly classified using the cut-off obtained by method B (ROC analysis). These results yielded sensitivity values of 87.9, 97.0, and 87.9%, respectively, considering the former cut-offs (method A), and sensitivities of 93.9, 97.0, and 93.9%, respectively, considering the latter cut-offs (method B). Although the sensitivity values of the rFhpCL1 and rFhpCL5 ELISAs obtained using cut-off values calculated with ROC curves (method B) are apparently better than those obtained with method A, it is relevant to consider that this increase in sensitivity was done at expenses of lowering the specificity of the assays by about 5% (see Table 2 ). With respect to infected sheep, the distribution of OD signals obtained in indirect ELISA with the three rFhpCLs was similar to that obtained for infected cattle (the lowest OD signal obtained with rFhpCL5 (OD = 0.185) and the highest with rFhpCL2 (OD = 2.260)). Interestingly, as the cut-off values calculated with method A (rFhpCL1, OD = 0.140; rFhpCL2, OD = 0.114; rFhpCL5, OD = 0.095; MM3-SERO, Age (range) 8.8 (4-12) 8.5 (9-12) 7.1 (4-10) 4.7 (3-8) a Statistic differences (p < 0.05) with group harboring 1-10 flukes b Statistic differences with group harboring 1-10 flukes (p < 0.01) and with group harboring 11-25 flukes (p < 0.05) c Animals in production, not sacrified at the moment of sample collection OD = 0.055) or the method B (rFhpCL1, OD = 0.121; rFhpCL2, OD = 0.100; rFhpCL5, OD = 0.085) were much lower than for cattle, the three ELISA variants and the MM3-SERO ELISA were capable of correctly classifying all sera from infected and non-infected sheep, i.e., with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% (Table 2) . Nevertheless, the comparison of the OD signals obtained in any of the indirect ELISAs with those yielded by the MM3-SERO capture ELISA (either for cattle or sheep) revealed that the signal-tonoise ratio was much more favorable in the latter. Finally, the r values obtained on comparing the four ELISA methods for Fasciola-infected cattle and sheep sera are shown in Table 3 . The correlation was strongest between the data obtained with rFhpCL5 and rFhpCL1 ELISAs for both cow and sheep sera, while the lowest r value corresponded to the comparison between the OD values of the tested cow sera in the MM3-SERO and rFhpCL5 ELISAs.",

For this purpose, we evaluated the presence of IgG antibodies reactive with a recombinant A. simplex allergen (rAni s 1) expressed in E. coli and purified using the same procedure as for rFhpCLs, or reactive with mouse IgG1 (purified mAb MM3 without F. hepatica antigens, which is used as control for each individual serum in the MM3-SERO ELISA). A relevant proportion of sera from cattle infected with F. hepatica had IgG antibodies reactive with rAni s 1, three of which produced OD signals above 1.0 (see Fig. 5a ). Although the reactivity of sera from the Fasciola-free population of cattle was much lower (Fig.  5b) , these samples still showed a notable reactivity to rAni s 1 (Fig. 5b) . Moreover, anti-mouse IgG1 crossreactivity was also observed for a significant number of sera within the samples from Fasciola-infected and Fasciola-free cows (Fig. 5e, f) . On the other hand, regarding serum samples from sheep, the population infected with F. hepatica did not recognize the rAni s 1 (Fig. 5c ) allergen, and only two serum samples from non-infected sheep produced OD values > 0.2 (Fig. 5d) . Also, no reaction to mouse IgG1 antibodies was observed when testing sheep sera from both populations (Fig. 5g, h) .",

            "text": "This is the first study that comparatively evaluates the performance of three rFhpCLs (rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, and rFhpCL5) as targets antigens in ELISA for the serodiagnosis of fasciolosis in sheep and cattle. These molecules were selected since (i) they are produced by adult flukes and thus continue stimulating the immune system during the chronic phase of the illness, and (ii) Fasciola cathepsins L1, L2, and L5 contain a common epitope recognized by mAb MM3, which is the capture antibody in the MM3-SERO ELISA (Mezo et al. 2007) . Although rFhpCLs from the L1 clade have already been successfully used to develop a very sensitive and specific lateral flow test for immunodiagnosis of human fascioliasis , as well as to design ELISA tests for human (O'Neill et al. 1999; Carnevale et al. 2001a, b; Gonzales Santana et al. 2013; Gottstein et al. 2014) and animal use (Cornelissen et al. 2001; Kuerpick et al. 2013; Selemetas et al. 2014; Bloemhoff et al. 2015) , the performance of rFhpCLs from L2 and L5 clades as ELISA targets has not previously been investigated. From a functional point of view, a single amino acid substitution may be sufficient to affect substrate specificity in cysteine proteases from F. hepatica (Smooker et al. 2000) . The comparison of the new FhpCL2 (gb|KY464953) and FhpCL5 (gb|KY392883) sequences described in the present study with other reported cathepsins L2 (gb|ABQ95351.1; gb|AAC47721.1) and L5 (gb|AAF76330) revealed some nucleotide and amino acid changes. However, as none of the amino acid changes were in the positions referred by Norbury et al. (2012) as being typical of the Fasciola L2 and L5 clades, the assignation of our recombinant molecules as FhpCL2 and FhpCL5 was probably correct. The alignment of the sequences of the three FhpCLs used in this study showed a mean of amino acid changes of 17%, which, besides affecting substrate specificity, it may be enough to induce variations in the level of circulating antibodies produced in infected animals. The results showing preferences in procathepsin recognition in the population of sera from Fasciola-infected animals, mainly cattle (see Fig. 2a ), are consistent with this hypothesis. More importantly, our results indicated that indirect ELISAs based on rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, and rFhpCL5 show differences in sensitivity, despite the fact that the target antigens were expressed and purified in the same way. Specifically, considering the OD values obtained with the different immunoassays, the cut-off values calculated to maximize specificity (method A), and the number of false negatives obtained for each rFhpCL, the rFhpCL2 might be a better target antigen than the other rFhpCLs. However, the MM3-SERO ELISA had a better performance, as this method classified correctly all samples from sheep and cattle. There are at least two explanations for the superiority of the MM3-SERO ELISA over the ELISAs based on the use of individual rFhpCLs: (i) mAb MM3 is able to virtually capture all native cathepsin isoforms of the CL1, CL2, and CL5 clades from Fasciola ; and this study), including those from the more pathogenic F. gigantica species Valero et al. 2016) . This may explain the fact that OD values obtained in MM3-SERO ELISA tended to be higher than in indirect ELISAs among infected animals with low anti-Fasciola antibody levels (see Fig. 2a ), and (ii) the MM3-SERO ELISA includes an individual control for each serum, which ensures that particular animals with anti-species cross-reactive antibodies or antibodies against other irrelevant proteins present in the ELISA plate (see Fig. 5e , f) can be easily detected, thus allowing this signal to be subtracted from that of the corresponding positive well. Consequently, good OD signals and low backgrounds (which translates into lower cut-offs) are normally achieved, yielding an excellent signalto-noise ratio, for both cattle and sheep sera. These results suggest that the use of a single recombinant cathepsin/ procathepsin as target antigen in ELISAs for serodiagnosis of fascioliasis may limit the sensitivity of the assay when testing sera from some species, particularly cattle.",

However, considering that representatives of all mature Fasciola CLs are captured in MM3-SERO, the high backgrounds obtained with the rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, and rFhpCL5 antigens for Fasciola-free cattle (see Fig. 2b ) may appear unexpected at first sight. Moreover, this phenomenon was not limited to the samples investigated in this study, nor to the expression of rpFhCLs in E. coli. In agreement with this, a similar finding was recently reported in a study where the performance of an indirect ELISA based on a rFhpCL1 expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris was compared with that of a commercial indirect ELISA test containing a purified fraction from Fasciola ESAs (f2 antigen; Institute Pourquier, Montpellier, France) (Kuerpick et al. 2013 ). Cross-reactivity was also observed by Cornelissen et al. (2001) who tested sera from sheep and cattle harboring other parasites, mainly nematodes, suggesting that the cross-reactivity may be due to common epitopes between recombinant Fasciola cathepsins and antigens present in other parasites. However, as such cross-reactivity did not occur with the three tested rFhpCLs (see Fig. 2b ), this explanation seems unlikely.",

            "text": "Another possible source of cross-reactivity is that rFhpCLs produced in E. coli were contaminated by bacterial proteins retained in the IMAC column during the affinity purification process. Coelution of native E. coli proteins (e.g., proteins containing clusters of histidine residues) with recombinant proteins is a recognized feature, mainly when recombinant proteins are expressed at low level (Robichon et al. 2011 ). However, this seems also unlikely for several reasons: (i) rFhpCLs are produced as inclusion bodies, and contaminating proteins are removed during the washing procedures before denaturation and subsequent IMAC purification of rFhpCLs; (ii) as indicated above, the reactivity of a particular serum does not occur with the three rFhpCLs, despite the fact that all of them were produced and purified following the same procedure; and (iii) preincubation of the cross-reactive sera with a bacterial extract prior to the incubation in ELISA plates, or the use of a rFhpCL1 expressed with a second tag in order to eliminate possible remaining contaminants in a capture ELISA did not eliminate the observed backgrounds (data not shown). Conversely, we hypothesize that the phenomenon may be related to a greater opportunity of cross-reactive antibodies to bind non-specific linear epitopes present in rpFhCL preparations than in native CLs. While in native antigens, the availability of non-specific linear epitopes may be low due to the correct folding of the protein, such epitopes may be exposed for antibody-binding when truncated, partially folded, or unfolded molecules are present, as occurs frequently when recombinant proteins are overexpressed in bacterial or yeast cell systems (Lilie et al. 1998; Cornelissen et al. 2001 ). In addition, an unexpectedly high number of samples from Fasciola-infected and non-infected cattle reacted with a recombinant form of the A. simplex Ani s 1 allergen (Fig. 5a,  b) , an antigen that is present in a fish parasite never naturally in contact with cattle, or with other herbivorous animals (Anad\u00f3n et al. 2010 ). Such allergen is structurally related with Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors (Audicana and Kennedy 2008) . Thus, with respect to Fasciola-infected cows, it could be hypothesized that cross-reactivity with rAni s 1 is due to the presence of common epitopes between this allergen and the Kunitz-type molecules secreted by Fasciola (Bozas et al. 1995; Di Maggio et al. 2016; Smith et al. 2016) . Nevertheless, the fact that the response was irregular among these cows, and that it also occurred, to a lesser extent, among Fasciola-free cows, suggests again that cross-reactive antibodies may be induced against antigens not related with Fasciola but which share some linear epitopes. Considering the above argumentations and the sensitivity obtained in the indirect ELISAs tested, the usual purification conditions of recombinant proteins expressed in bacterial or yeast systems may render these antigens not suitable for use as target in ELISAs for serodiagnosis of fascioliasis in certain animal species. Besides, there is also experimental data suggesting that cross-reactivity may not occur in the same way in different host species. In this sense, we observed that the OD responses to rFhpCLs were more homogeneous in infected sheep than in cattle (see Figs. 3a and 2a, respectively), which was also reflected by the higher r values obtained for sheep sera relative to cattle sera, when comparing the OD values obtained on testing the different rFhpCLs (see Table 3 ). Moreover, interspecific differences in the generation of cross-reactive antibodies to Fasciola procathepsins can also be deduced from a previous study in which no cross-reactivity was observed for human sera in a lateral flow test based on the same rFhpCL1 ) used in the present study. This reflects that some species may be more prone to induce cross-reactive antibodies than others or that the antigens to which humans are exposed have fewer common epitopes with Fasciola CLs than those to which ruminants are exposed.",

Moreover, it did not condition the fact that recombinant CLs purified by IMAC may be more prone to be recognized by cross-reactive antibodies than the corresponding natural antigens. Finally, although liver necropsy and coproantigen detection may not be perfect gold standards, since some animals may only have migrating or ectopic flukes, considering the age of cattle in our study (4-12 years old), the probability of having a single contact within the previous weeks before slaughtering is minimal.",
