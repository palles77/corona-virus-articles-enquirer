Meanwhile, the relative levels of miR-17-92 were measured by using real-time qPCR. The association between the relative levels of miR-17-92 and the anxiety and the depression of CHD patients after PCI was analyzed.

The proportion of anxious (P = 0.045) and depressed subjects (P = 0.042) in the TG group was lower than that in the CG group.

Tai Chi has been proven to improve SSD and SSA symptoms over 1 year of intervention (Rawtaer et al., 2015) . Meta-analysis has shown that Tai Chi intervention reduced the Hamilton Depression Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores of stroke patients (Yang et al., 2018) .

The miR-17-92 cluster is an important indicator in the development of the immune system, the heart, and the lung and in oncogenic patients. It is involved with cellular innate and adaptive immunity, such as B cells, T-lymphocyte subsets, T follicular helper cells, regulatory T cells, monocytes, macrophages, and so on (Kuo et al., 2019) . The miR-17-92 cluster plays a critical role in cardiomyocyte proliferation (Gao et al., 2019) and affects the development of various diseases by regulating many related cellular processes and multiple target genes, including neurological diseases and cardiac diseases (Bai et al., 2019) . The members of the miR-17-92 cluster and the expression of their passenger miRNAs expressions promote exercise-induced cardiac growth and reduce adverse ventricular remodeling (Shi et al., 2017) . Cardiac rehabilitation will contribute in protecting against the development of depression and anxiety (Zheng et al., 2019) . A recent study showed that miR-17-92 may regulate neurogenesis and anxiety-and depression-like behaviors (Jin et al., 2016) . Tai Chi can affect the level of miRNA, and it possibly also affects the level of miR-17-92 because it can improve the symptoms of anxiety and depression (Rawtaer et al., 2015) .",

The primers for miR-17-92 (forward primer 5 -TCATACACGTGGACCTAAC-3 and reverse primer 5 -CTCTCTAAGAAACCAATCC-3 ) and U6 (forward primer 5 -GCTTCGGCAGCACATATACTAAAAT-3 and reverse primer 5 -CGCTTCACGAATTTGCGTGTCAT-3 ) were synthesized by TaKaRa. The PCR was performed as follows: 95 \u2022 C for 3 min, one cycle and 45 cycles of 20 s at 94 \u2022 C and 40 s at 60 \u2022 C, respectively. Default threshold settings were used as threshold cycle (Ct). After calculating the Ct value, the level of miR-17-92 was normalized to U6, and the relative quantification of miRNA expression was calculated with 2-Ct. The miRNA stability was measured by using the total RNA harvested at 4, 8, and 12 h (Mall et al., 2013) , and the miRNA expression was confirmed using the abovementioned real-time qPCR.",

For instance, preclinical evidence supports that the microRNA-34 family is involved in stress-related psychiatric conditions and in the modulation of depression (Lo Iacono et al., 2019) . miR-140-5p has been found to be associated with the pathogenesis of late-onset poststroke depression . The miR-101a-3p and its target, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2) in the amygdala, contribute to anxiety-like behavior (Cohen et al., 2017) . The microRNA levels may change based on the training type or exercise (Domanska-Senderowska et al., 2019) . Aerobic exercise delays neurodegenerative diseases and lesions by regulating miR-3557/324 . It is quite possible that Tai Chi also induces the changes in miRNA. The present work also showed that the serum level of miR-17-92 was increased after Tai Chi intervention. Furthermore, a negative correlation between the serum level of miR-17-92 and the scores of anxiety, depression, and stress was observed (Figure 5) . The results suggested that the miR-17-92 changes may contribute to the emotional changes.",

The exact molecular mechanism for the functional role of Tai Chi was not explored in the CHD patients after PCI. The possible side effects of Tai Chi were not investigated, although most reports showed that Tai Chi could reduce most side effects of various diseases (Murley et al., 2019; So et al., 2019) . According to our experiences, there is a difference in learning Tai Chi between males and females, but the issue was not explored in the present study. Further work is highly needed in the future.",
