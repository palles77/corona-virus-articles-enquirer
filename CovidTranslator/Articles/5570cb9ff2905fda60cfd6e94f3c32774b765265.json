Almost certainly the high number of predicted gene models and proteins is 212 an overestimation due to fragmented genes, very different isoforms or unresolved alleles, that will be 213 consolidated as annotation of the Parhyale genome improves. We also included additional high 214 confidence gene predictions that were not found in the transcriptome ( Figure 4C ). The canonical 215 proteome dataset was annotated with both Pfam, KEGG, and BLAST against Uniprot.

            "text": "High levels of heterozygosity and polymorphism in the Parhyale genome 224 To estimate the level of heterozygosity in genes we first identified transcribed regions of the genome by 225 mapping back transcripts to the assembly. Where these regions appeared in a single contig in the 226 assembly, heterozygosity was calculated using information from mapped reads. Where these regions 227 appeared in more than one contig, because haplotypes had assembled independently, heterozygosity was 228 calculated using an alignment of the genomic sequences corresponding to mapped transcripts and 229 information from mapped reads. This allowed us to calculate heterozygosity for each gene within the 230 sequenced individual (Supplemental Data 9). We then calculated the genomic coverage of all transcribed 231 regions in the genome and found, as expected, they fell broadly into two categories with higher and lower 232 read coverage ( Figure 6A ; Supplemental Data 9). Genes that fell within the higher read coverage group 233 had a lower mean heterozygosity (1.09% of bases displaying polymorphism), which is expected as more 234 reads were successfully mapped. Genes that fell within the lower read coverage group had a higher is not substantially different between genes from the higher (0.88%) versus lower coverage group genes 244 (0.73%; Figure 6C ). This analysis suggests that within captive laboratory populations of Parhyale there is 245 considerable additional polymorphism distributed across genes, irrespective of whether or not they have 246 relatively low or high heterozygosity in the individual male we sequenced. In addition the single male we 247 have sequenced provides an accurate reflection of polymorphism of the wider laboratory population and 248 the established Chicago-F strain does not by chance contain unusually divergent haplotypes. We also 249 performed an assessment of polymorphism on previously cloned Parhyale developmental genes, and To further evaluate the extent of polymorphism across the genome, we mapped the genomic reads to a set 256 of previously Sanger-sequenced BAC clones of the Parhyale Hox cluster from the same Chicago-F line 257 from which we sequenced the genome of an adult male. [18] . We detected SNPs at a rate of 1.3 to 2.5% 258 among the BACs (Table 3) and also additional sequence differences between the BACs and genomic 259 reads, confirming that additional polymorhism exists in the Chicago-F line beyond that detected between 260 in the haplotypes of the individual male we sequenced. 261 Overlapping regions of the contiguous BACs gave us the opportunity to directly compare Chicago-F 262 haplotypes and accurately observe polynucleotide polymorphisms, that are difficult to detect with short 263 reads that do not map when polymorphisms are large, but are resolved by longer Sanger reads. (Figure   264 7A). Since the BAC clones were generated from a pool of Chicago-F animals, we expected each 265 sequenced BAC to be representative of one haplotype. Overlapping regions between BAC clones could 266 potentially represent one or two haplotypes. We found that the genomic reads supported the SNPs 267 observed between the overlapping BAC regions. We found relatively few base positions with evidence 268 supporting the existence of a third allele. This analysis revealed many insertion/deletion (indels) with 269 some cases of indels larger than 100 base pairs ( Figure 7B ). The finding that polynucleotide with Scr in the first maxillary segment where they are co-expressed ( Figure 10A-A\") . As a negative 359 control, we detected no linkage between engrailed1 (en1) and Ubx or abd-A transcripts ( Figure 10B -B\" 360 and C -C\"). We then demonstrated the tightly coupled transcripts of lab with Dfd (co-expressed in the 361 second antennal segment, Figure 10D The ParaHox and NK gene clusters encode other ANTP class homeobox genes closely related to Hox 371 genes [83]. In Parhyale, we found 2 caudal (Cdx) and 1 Gsx ParaHox genes. Compared to hexapods, we 372 identified expansions in some NK-like genes, including 5 Bar homeobox genes (BarH1/2), 2 developing 373 brain homeobox genes (DBX) and 6 muscle segment homeobox genes (MSX/Drop). Evidence from 374 several bilaterian genomes suggests that NK genes are clustered together [84] [85] [86] [87] . In the current assembly 375 of the Parhyale genome, we identified an NK2-3 gene and an NK3 gene on the same scaffold 376 (phaw 30.0004720) and the tandem duplication of an NK2 gene on another scaffold (phaw 30.0004663).",

Genotyping of one of these 613 embryos demonstrated that the tagged PhDll-e locus was indeed encoding a functional PhDll-e protein 614 with a small in-frame deletion around the targeted region (Figure 16, Supplemental Figure 1 F). 615 These results, together with the other recent applications of the CRISPR/Cas system to study Hox genes 616 in Parhyale [18, 19], demonstrate that the ability to manipulate the fertilized eggs together with the slow 617 tempo of early cleavages can result in very high targeting frequencies and low levels of mosaicism for 618 both knock-out and knock-in approaches. Considering the usefulness of the genome-wide resources 619 described in this report, we anticipate that the Parhyale embryo will prove an extremely powerful system 620 for fast and reliable G0 screens of gene expression and function. 621 CONCLUSION 622 In this article we described the first complete genome of a malacostracan crustacean species, the genome 623 of the marine amphipod Parhyale hawaiensis. At an estimated size of 3.6 Gb, it is among the largest 624 genomes submitted to NCBI. The Parhyale genome reported here is that of a single adult male from a 625 sib-bred line called Chicago-F. We find Parhyale has an abundance of repetitive sequence and high levels 626 of heterozygosity in the individual sequenced. Combined with analysis of available transcriptome 627 sequences and independently sequenced genomic BAC clones, we conclude high levels of heterozygosity 628 are representative of high levels of single and polynucleotide polymorphisms in the broader laboratory 629 population. Our comparative bioinformatics analyses suggest that the expansion of repetitive sequences 630 and the increase in gene size due to an expansion of intron size have contributed to the large size of the 631 genome. Despite these challenges, the Parhyale genome and associated transcriptomic resources reported 632 here provide a useful assembly of most genic regions in the genome and a comprehensive description of 633 the Parhyale transcriptome and proteome. 634 Parhyale has emerged since the early 2000's as an attractive animal model for developmental genetic and 635 molecular cell biology research. It fulfills several desirable biological and technical requirements as an 636 experimental model, including a relatively short life-cycle, year-round breeding under standardized 637 laboratory conditions, availability of thousands of eggs for experimentation on a daily basis, and 638 amenability to various embryological, cellular, molecular genetic and genomic approaches. In addition, 639 Parhyale has stereotyped cell lineages and cell behaviors, a direct mode of development, a remarkable 640 appendage diversity and the capacity to regenerate limbs post-embryonically. These qualities can be 641 utilized to address fundamental long-standing questions in developmental biology, like cell fate 642 specification, nervous system development, organ morphogenesis and regeneration [155].

From a functional genomics 651 perspective, the Parhyale immune system appears to be a good representative of the malacostracan or 652 even the multicrustacean clade that can be studied in detail with existing tools and resources. Besides the 653 evolutionary implications and the characterization of alternative strategies used by arthropods to defend 654 against pathogens, a deeper mechanistic understanding of the Parhyale immune system will be relevant to 655 aquaculture. Some of the greatest setbacks in the crustacean farming industry are caused by severe 656 disease outbreaks.
