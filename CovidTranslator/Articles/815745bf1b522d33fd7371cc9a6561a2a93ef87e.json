The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data.",

This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. We assume that 2019-nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. Use the latest reported data from National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCov. Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated.

That means, the incubation individual is being infected and maybe has the ability of infectiousness but without symptom. However, the existing forecasting model, Susceptible-Exposed-Identified-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. And other forecasting model, such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, even doesn't consider the exposed process. So, maybe traditional transmission models of epidemic spreading are not suit for 2019-nCoV. That is a possible key reason for why the estimating infected population based on SEIR model are too far more than the official number. The estimate number is 75815 individuals in Jan. 25 2020 [4] while the official number is only 688 individuals; the estimate number is 190000 individuals in Wuhan in Feb. 4th 2020 [5] while the official number is only 1967 individuals.

So, we assume the identified individual has no ability of spreading since she/he will be pharmaceutical quarantined.

From the simulation of baseline scenario, the estimation of the first half of the epidemic spreading from Jan. 20 (t=66) to Feb.7 (t=84) is higher than the official data. This could be explained by that, at the first stage, as the absence of the knowledge of the novel virus, the diagnoses are impossible to identify all the exposed individuals in time. So, it is naturally the confirmed number would be less than the actual exposed individuals at the beginning period of epidemic spreading.",

However, the reported case numbers are still rising rapidly. Simulating the epidemic spreading trend of 2019-nCoV under the control measures are of crucial importance for public health planning and control domestically and internationally. Several earlier publications have given some useful forecasting of 2019-nCoV [4, 5, [8] [9] [10] [11] , but their estimating numbers are too far more than the official data. The estimating of epidemic spreading should consider the effect of actions have been taken to mitigate the spreading. Furthermore, the asymptomatic infection and transmission characters should be considered in the transmission model. Transmission model and parameters are essential for the generation of accurate forecasting of infected population and spreading trend [12] .",

Nonetheless, our study has several major limitations. First, we assumed that the transmission of 2019-nCoV mainly caused by exposed individuals (without symptoms) and the transmission ability of identified (without symptoms) is ignored. Second, our transmission model was somewhat sensitive to several key parameters: the starting date of epidemic spreading, the exposed (incubation) period and the identified (treatment) period. And our assumption regarding the exposed (incubation) period and the identified (treatment) period is keeping stable.
