Dentin is produced by columnar cells with basal nuclei called odontoblasts, which differentiate from mesenchyme of the dental papilla. Initially it is unmineralized (predentin), but later mineralized. The odontoblasts move away from the dentinenamel junction, gradually encroaching on the pulp cavity as they produce dentin. Each odontoblast has a process extending into the dentin, encased in a dentinal tubule, that arborizes at the dentin-enamel junction. The process also anastomoses with the processes of other odontoblasts. Dentinal tubules are visible in histologic sections, but the anastomoses are not.

The most common form of odontogenic dentigerous cysts in animals are those involving the vestigial wolf teeth of horses and the vestigial canines, especially of mares. The smaller cysts appear as tumors of the gums, while some of the larger ones may cause swelling of the jaw or adjacent maxillary sinus. Dentigerous cysts of animals are not as destructive as those in humans, in which they are regarded as the most common benign destructive lesion of the skeleton.",

Subnormal wear, due to loss of the opposing tooth, occurs in oligodontia, abnormal spacing of adjacent teeth, and acquired loss of teeth; it results in abnormal lengthening. Such elongated teeth may grow against the opposing gum or, if deviated, into an adjacent soft structure such as cheek or lip. These teeth usually wear in abnormal places because complete loss of antagonism is unusual, because the upper and lower arcades do not coincide exactly, and the coincidence is further reduced by the displacement of chewing. Incomplete longitudinal coincidence of the molar arcades allows irregular wear and hook formation on the first and last cheek teeth. Abnormal wear due to abnormal chewing is caused by voluntary, as in painful conditions, or mechanical impairment of jaw movement. Lateral movements of the jaws without the normal rotary grinding movements allow the ridges of the teeth of herbivores to become accentuated. Steep angulation of the occlusal surfaces results from inadequate lateral movement of the jaws, and sharp edges form on the buccal aspect of the maxillary teeth and the lingual aspect of the mandibular teeth. This may be unilateral when the animal chews with only one side of its mouth, the other side then being affected. The teeth wear progressively sharper and pass each other like shear blades, hence the term \"shear mouth.\" Subnormal resistance to wear on the part of the molar teeth is common and results in \"weave mouth\" or \"step mouth,\" in which successive teeth in an arcade wear at different rates. The weave or step form of the antagonistic arcade is reversed so that the teeth of the two arcades interdigitate. This pattern of attrition is caused by variation in the hardness of opposing teeth, and usually is caused by intermittent odontodystrophy. Opposing teeth of the upper and lower jaws do not develop at the same time, thus discontinuous nutritional deficiencies often result in unequal wear. Certain vices, such as crib biting, also produce abnormal wear. In severely worn ruminant incisors a central black core may be visible, which is secondary dentin deposited in the pulp cavity.

It is considered more fully under Infectious and Parasitic Diseases of the Gastrointestinal Tract. VESICULAR STOMATITIDES. Stomatitis, characterized by the formation of vesicles, occurs in most species of domestic animals. The vesicles develop as accumulations of serous fluid within the epithelium or between the epithelium and the lamina propria. These may coalesce to form bullae, and the elevated epithelium is easily rubbed off during chewing to leave raw eroded patches with bits of epithelium still adherent. The transition from vesicle to erosion occurs rapidly so that in individual animals, vesicles may not be seen. This is especially so in dogs and cats because the oral mucosa is very thin. Because the basal epithelium or basement membrane remains intact, regeneration and healing are complete in a few days unless the local lesions are complicated by bacterial or mycotic infections. However, foci of previous erosion may be identifiable for some months by their slight depression and lack of pigmentation. Vesicular stomatitides in animals have been associated with viral infections, and these are still the most common causes. In horses, cattle, and swine, oral vesicles should be regarded as indicating foot and mouth disease, vesicular stomatitis, swine vesicular disease, or vesicular exanthema until proven otherwise.

Typical clinical signs associated with these tumors are excessive salivation, halitosis, pain, dysphagia, loose teeth, oral bleeding, coughing, and a change in voice. All of these signs are determined by the location of the tumor. All malignant oral tumors in dogs and cats tend to follow a rapid course, and re-gardless of the type of malignancy, the prognosis is poor.

It can be transmitted only to the scarified oral mucosa and not to other mucous membranes. The incubation period is generally 1 month.

The warts first develop on the lips as single, smooth, papular elevations that are pale or the color of the mucosa.

There is compression of the posterior vena cava, which results in a redirection of blood flow from the caudal areas of the animal. The blood is shunted through the lumbar veins, into the longitudinal vertebral sinuses, from there to the intercostal veins, and into the hemiazygos or costocervical vein.

There is marked edema, congestion, and hemorrhage of the cervical muscles and of the lymph nodes of the head and neck. An inconsistent, but significant, finding is the so-called bloat line in the esophageal mucosa ( Fig. 1.8E ). This lesion is formed due to congestion with petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages in the mucosa of the cervical esophagus, which changes abruptly or gradually to a pale mucosa at the level of the thoracic inlet. The tracheal mucosa is hemorrhagic, especially anterior to the thoracic inlet. Blood clots are frequently seen in the bronchi and paranasal and frontal sinuses. The lungs are compressed into the anterior thorax by the bulging diaphragm. There is pressure ischemia of the abdominal viscera, especially the liver. The extreme margins of the hepatic lobes may be congested. Lymph nodes and the muscles of the hind legs are pale. There may be marked subcutaneous edema, particularly of the vulva and perineum.

The affected villi are necrotic, but ulceration may be delayed if there is ruminal atony and stasis. If the animal recovers from the immediate effects of overeating, the necrotic epithelium sloughs, the ulcer contracts, and epithelial regeneration begins from the margins. The regenerated epithelium is flat and white, and the specialized villi do not completely return. A stellate scar remains, but many of the smaller lesions may disappear completely ( Fig. 1.9C ). Hepatic metastases are initially typical of necrobacillosis, consisting of coagulative necrosis, but in time they liquefy to form typical abscesses and these often persist long after the initial ruminal lesions have healed, cicatrized, and disappeared.",

There is no storage of thiamine. In the normal ruminal flora, thiamine production depends on a delicate balance between thiamine and thiaminase-producing bacteria. In ruminal acidosis this balance may be disturbed by the proliferation of Streptococcus bovis, which is known to consume thiamine. In addition, the acid medium may be favorable for thiaminase-producing organisms such as Clostridium sporogenes and Bacillus thiaminolyticus.

Bovine alimentary papillomas are usually solitary, though a minority of infected animals may have multiple lesions. Most are small ( < 1 . 0 cm), broadly pedunculate, tapering, acuminate masses. They are composed of a number of closely packed fronds of squamous epithelium, each supported by a light core of fibrous stroma and arising from a common fibrous base. Some form flattened sessile hyperplastic epithelial plaques, while others, usually limited to the esophagus, form fibropapillomas. The latter are smooth, nodular masses comprised of acanthotic epithelium supported by a fibromatous stroma, occasionally found in close physical association with a more typical papilloma. In a low proportion of typical alimentary papillomas in cattle, but not in fibropapillomas, eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies may be present in keratinizing cells. In these, and in vacuolate nuclei containing amphophilic material, papovaviruses may be found by electron microscopy.

Gastrin alone appears to be a weak calcium-ion-dependent stimulator of acid production by isolated cells, but it contributes to the synergistic effects on secretion seen in cells exposed to histamine and acetylcholine. This probably explains its contribution to phasic acid secretion in the intact animal. In addition, gastrin has an important trophic effect on parietal cell mass, stimulating synthesis of nucleic acid and protein and increasing the number of parietal cells in fundic mucosa.",

Fundic surface mucous cells also may actively secrete bicarbonate into a thin, unstirred layer of surface mucus. Here a sharp pH gradient is maintained, neutral on the cell-surface side, acid on the luminal side. By this means, bicarbonate secretion of relatively small magnitude in relation to total acid secretion may hypothetically protect the mucosa against attack by acid.

Primary gastric dilation, and sometimes rupture, in horses is a sequel to consumption of excess fermentable carbohydrate or sudden access to lush pasture. The pathogenesis is analogous to that of grain overload in cattle. Ingesta may swell through absorption of saliva and gastric secretion. Evolution of gas and organic acids, including lactic acid, by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrate occurs in the cranial portion of the stomach. An influx of water follows as the result of increased osmotic pressure in the stomach, contributing to increased distention and systemic dehydration. Animals surviving for any time with acute gastric dilatation of this type may develop laminitis. The contents of the stomach in gastric dilation may be fluid, especially in secondary dilatation, and can smell fermented in primary dilation. Gastric rupture may ensue. Rupture usually occurs along the greater curvature parallel to the omental attachment, releasing gastric content into the omental bursa or the abdominal cavity. Death ensues acutely as the result of shock and peritonitis. The margins of the gastric laceration, which may be 10-15 cm long, show evidence of antemortem hemorrhage. Postmortem rupture of the dilated stomach is common and must be differentiated. There may be congestion of the cervical esophagus and blanching of the thoracic esophagus, producing a prominent \"bloat line.\" This, and compression atelectasis of the lungs in some cases, attests to the tremendous increase in intraabdominal and intrathoracic pressure exerted by the dilated stomach prior to rupture. Congestion of cervical and cranial soft tissues and blanching of the abdominal organs also are found.

The gas, which appears to play a large part in the development of dilation, is probably the result of aerophagia and evolution of carbon dioxide by physiologic mechanisms, rather than the product of intragastric clostridial fermentation. Inability to relieve the accumulation of food, fluid, and gas in the stomach causes the organ to dilate and alter its intraabdominal position, so that its long axis rotates from a transverse left-right orientation to one paralleling that of the abdomen. In simple dilation, the esophagus is not physically completely occluded, the spleen remains on the left side, and the duodenum is only slightly displaced dorsally and toward the midline.

The stomach rotates about the esophagus in a clockwise direction, as viewed from the ventrocaudal aspect. The greater curvature of the distended organ moves ventrally and caudally, and then rotates dorsally and to the right. This forces the pylorus and terminal duodenum cranially to the right and clockwise around the esophagus. Ultimately, they lie to the left of midline across and ventral to the esophagus, compressed between the esophagus and the dilated stomach. Depending on the degree of volvulus, the spleen, which follows the gastrosplenic ligament, usually ends up lying in a right ventral position, between the stomach and liver or diaphragm. It is bent into a V shape by tension on its ligaments, becomes extremely congested, and may undergo torsion, infarction, and rupture. The esophagus becomes completely occluded in volvulus, which may involve rotation of up to 270 to 360\u00b0. Venous infarction of the gastric mucosa ensues as volvulus progressively constricts venous outflow from the stomach.

Subacute to chronic ulcers are typified by a base and sides composed of granulation tissue of varying thickness and maturity, infiltrated by a mixed inflammatory cell population, and overlain by a usually thin layer of necrotic debris. Chronic ulcers wax and wane. Depending on the relative dominance of reparative processes and aggressive ulceration, the layer of granulation tissue may be thick and mature, or thinner, less mature, and with superficial evidence of recent necrosis. There is mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia in glands at the periphery of the ulcer, which, with time, overhang the edge of the lesion. Under favorable conditions they gradually fill in the mucosal defect from the margins. Healed ulcers are usually depressed and may be somewhat puckered, with a scirrhous submucosa on cut section. The mucosa of healed ulcers, even in the fundic zone, is comprised of mucous glands. Excessive scarring of healed ulcers strategically located near the pylorus may lead to pyloric obstruction in any species.",

Stressful husbandry practices have been considered to contribute to development of ulcer, though glucocorticoid administration causes lesions of the fundus, not pars esophagea, in pigs. High dietary copper levels, feeding of whey, starchy diets low in protein, and high levels of dietary unsatu-rated fatty acids have been associated. Experimental infection with Ascaris suum has been implicated with ulcer, but natural infection is not considered causally associated. Experimentally, factors stimulating acid secretion, especially histamine, consistently cause ulcers of the pars esophagea, suggesting that gastric acidity may play an etiologic role. Repeatedly, finely ground rations have been found to be ulcerogenic and are the single most important contributing factor. Squamous epithelium has no innate buffering capacity, and it is highly susceptible to attack by gastric acid, as occurs in reflux esophagitis. Similar events may initiate ulceration of the pars esophagea. Swine with gastric ulcer often have abnormally fluid stomach contents. In experimental studies there is slow gastric emptying with progressive declines in pH with time. Feeding of finely divided rations is associated experimentally with increased water in stomach content. There is loss of partitioning of gastric content, and the pH gradient from esophagus to pylorus that occurs in the normal porcine stomach is not established. Relatively low pH occurs at the esophageal end of the stomach, while the pH at the pylorus is higher than normal. Under these conditions of prolonged gastric distention and relatively high antral pH, gastrin-stimulated acid secretion may be excessive. Fluidity and increased mixing of content may expose the pars esophagea, which should normally be in contact with material buffered to pH 5 or greater, to excess acid. This may initiate the epithelial changes described, which culminate in ulceration. Whey may in itself be acid, and would presumably cause an abnormally fluid gastric environment. This could explain its association with ulcer in swine. How other factors mentioned above might be implicated in ulcerogenesis is less clear.",

Fundamentally, sodium absorption depends on electrochemical forces established by the ATP-dependent sodium pump on the basolateral cell membrane of the enterocyte. This pump moves N a + up a concentration gradient from the cell in the lateral intercellular space. The first mechanism involves independent, or uncoupled, electrogenic N a + absorption. Sodium ion enters the cell from the luminal solution down an electrostatic and concentration gradient established by the sodium pump, which exchanges K + for Na + , but not at an equal rate. Absorption of N a + is also coupled to that of organic solutes such as amino acids and glucose. Sodium moves into the cell down the electrochemical gradient established by the sodium pump, but it does so coupled to movement of the organic solute. Sodium is then pumped out across the basolateral membrane, while the organic solute moves via carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion out of the cell. Most sodium and chloride is probably absorbed together by a neutral process, involving transcellular route for both ions. Sodium ion moving into the cell at the apical margin, as a result of the gradient established by the sodium pump, is coupled with C l~, carrying it \"uphill\" into the cell, whence it moves passively to the interstitium, while N a + is pumped out.",

The selectivity of macromolecular transfer varies with the species, being least specific in neonatal ruminants, piglets, and foals, which take up most macromolecules contacting the epithelium. Permeability of the gut to macromolecules is the result of energy-dependent pinocytosis by the apical cell membrane at the base of microvilli. Colostral protein is transferred in membrane-bound vacuoles in the cytoplasm to the basolateral membrane, where, by exocytosis, the contents are extruded, to find their way via the lacteal and lymphatics to the general circulation.

In dogs, it may be the result of voluntarily suppressed painful defecation, as in prostatic enlargement and inflammation of the anal sacs. Occasionally it is due to an impaction with foreign bodies, especially fine bones in the colon or rectum. It may also complicate paralyzing lesions of the spinal cord. Impaction of the cecum or colon in horses is largely a disease of older animals in which probably there is some degree of motor and secretory insufficiency. It is often precipitated by a change of diet from something soft and lush to hay or chaff, which because of the dental attrition of old age is poorly masticated and salivated. In these animals, impaction of the cecum may be recurrent. Ingestion of rope or pieces of conveyor belt has been associated with colonic impaction caused by indigestible synthetic fibers. Ingestion of large numbers of acorns and leaves may also cause impaction of the intestinal tract in ruminants.",

Therefore, most of them involve the anterior-dorsal part of the abdominal cavity and impinge on the duodenum. Inflammatory peritoneal adhesions are common, and fibrous bands may stretch from the wall of the bowel to some fixed point or between two or more points along the bowel or mesentery; the obstruction develops gradually as cicatrization ties the bowel down or puts kinks in the mesentery. Large, firm masses of abdominal fat necrosis cause compression stenosis of small intestine, coiled colon, and particularly, descending colon and rectum of cattle. Peduncles of some tumors, especially mesenteric lipomas in older horses, occasionally become wound about loops of intestine and cause obstruction and strangulation. Incarceration in hernias, discussed elsewhere, is also a common cause of compression obstruction of the gut.",

Torsion of the long axis of the mesentery occurs commonly in suckling ruminants, in swine, uncommonly in horses, and rarely in dogs and cats. In all species, the result is rapid death. The abdomen is distended, and on opening the cavity, the tensely dilated deep red to black loops of bowel are immediately apparent. In swine, the mesentery of the small intestine and sometimes the large bowel is often involved in a torsion that usually is counterclockwise, when viewed from the ventrocaudal aspect. In torsion involving the small and large intestines, the apex of the cecum may be pointing cranial in the anterior right quadrant of the abdomen, reflecting the rotation pf -180\u00b0. In swine, mesenteric torsion may be due to gas production from a highly fermentable substrate in the colon, and its subsequent displacement, with progression to mesenteric torsion. Mesenteric torsion is a common cause of sporadic sudden death in swine but may occur as a herd problem. Many cases of so called intestinal hemorrhage syndrome in that species are probably misdiagnosed mesenteric torsion ( Fig. 1.13B ). The presence of red-black or bloody content in the intestine of feeder swine, without torsion, may also signal bleeding gastric ulcer or proliferative hemorrhagic enteropathy associated with Campylobacter.",

In \"shock gut\" in dogs and, rarely, other species, associated terminally with heart failure, hemorrhage, hypo-volemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, part or all of the mucosa of the small intestine is deeply congested and the content hemorrhagic. The pathogenesis of the lesion is related to reflex vasoconstriction in the mucosa and submucosa, shunting of blood away from the mucosa, dilation of mucosal capillaries, and reduction in rate of flow of blood through the villus. Countercurrent transfer of oxygen from the afferent to efferent vessels in the villus aggravates hypoxemia in the villus by increased shunting of oxygen to the efferent venule. Splanchnic pooling of blood, systemic arterial hypotension, and intestinal vasoconstriction occur in endotoxic shock in dogs, causing similar mucosal lesions. Microthrombosis associated with sluggish flow, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and endotoxemia may contribute to mucosal ischemia by obstructing capillaries in the villi, and mucosal and submucosal venules; microthrombi in these vessels in association with hemorrhagic mucosal necrosis suggest the possibility of ischemia due to slow flow.",

Slow flow due to reduced arterial perfusion with inadequate collateral flow may be expected to affect the ' 'watershed'' of a circulatory field preferentially. In the horse, this may be the explanation for mucosal lesions at the pelvic flexure and apex of the cecum in which thromboembolism cannot be implicated, but in which mural thrombi in the cranial mesenteric root could have caused significantly reduced perfusion. Ischemia at the periphery of the circulatory field of the caudal mesenteric artery may possibly predispose to rectal perforation in horses. The precarious perfusion of the mucosa at this site may contribute to ischemic ulceration and the development of rectal stricture in swine.

Soluble chalones released from the functional compartment have been proposed as the effectors of a negative-feedback mechanism acting on crypt cells, but they are poorly characterized.

Hence, it is highly desirable to correlate the histologic appearance with the microtopography of the mucosa as seen under the dissecting or scanning electron microscope. The degree of differentiation, and therefore, the functional status of enterocytes on villi, can be inferred from their appearance.

Vibrio cholerae a n d \u00a3 . coli are the most important sources of such toxins, though only the latter occurs in domestic animals; some Salmonella serotypes, Yersinia enterocolitica, and perhaps Shigella also produce enterotoxin. Cholera and heat-labile E. coli enterotoxin act through the mediation of cyclic AMP. In surface enterocytes, toxin-stimulated cAMP shuts down sodium chloride cotransport at the luminal cell membrane, reducing passive water absorption. Meanwhile, in crypt epithelium, cAMP-stimulated chloride secretion is promoted, and water follows. The resultant increase in secretion by crypts and decrease in absorption by villi increases the solute and water load passing from the small bowel for the colon.

It has been proposed that dilated lacteals may rupture, releasing lymph into the lumen of the intestine. Hypocalcemia may be related to loss of the mineral bound to plasma albumin, and perhaps to formation of soaps with malabsorbed lipid in the gut lumen.

Inflammatory cells, mainly neutrophils, and tissue fluid effuse into the lumen through defects in the epithelium. Persistent erosion or previous erosion in a healed mucosa is marked by the development of a thin, horizontally arrayed layer of connective tissue in the superficial lamina propria. With increasing chronicity in colitis of mild or moderate degree, there may be deposition of a collagenous stroma, throughout which inflammatory cells are interspersed, which separates glands abnormally throughout the mucosa.

Lesions affecting Peyer's patches in the small intestine strongly suggest bovine virus diarrhea or rinderpest. Coronavirus causes microscopic lesions in colonic crypts, as well as in small intestine, in young calves. Rarely, a mild fibrinous typhlocolitis is seen grossly. Salmonellosis affects all age groups from neonate to adult and may frequently involve both small and large intestine in catarrhal to fibrinohemorrhagic enteritis; mesenteric lymph nodes are usually enlarged. Coccidiosis may involve ileum and large intestine; it often can be diagnosed by mucosal scraping at autopsy. Adenovirus infection may cause severe hemorrhagic colitis, with few lesions elsewhere, as may malignant head catarrh on occasion. Arsenic, other heavy metals, and oak or acorn poisoning may also cause hemorrhagic typhlocolitis and dysentery. Rarely, trichuriasis causes a hemorrhagic mucosal typhlitis in calves.",

Generally, the subtypes cross-immunize to a useful degree, but exceptions do arise and become recognizable, especially when vaccination fails. Antigenic drift can also be demonstrated experimentally; new subtypes can be produced by passing the virus in immune or partially immune animals, or by growing the virus in vitro in the presence of immune serum.

The necrotic cells fragment and slough and may cause dilation of affected glands. The mucosa is locally infiltrated by a variety of leukocytes and is edematous. In some affected foci, the glandular epithelium loses its differentiated appearance, becoming cuboidal, basophilic, and apparently mucus secretory. These glands too may be dilated with a small quantity of contained epithelial and leukocytic debris. In some abomasa, mucous metaplasia may be patchy but widespread and may reflect inflammation in the mucosa. There is some edema, hemorrhage, and modest leukocytic infiltration of the submucosa. Some necrotic foci in the abomasal glands appear to be associated with necrosis of adjacent mucosal lymphoid follicles.",

The condition is enzootic or seasonally epizootic in most of Africa, the Middle East, the eastern Mediterranean basin, the Indian subcontinent, the Caribbean, and the United States. A strain of bluetongue has been isolated from Culicoides in northern Australia, but spontaneous disease has not been recognized. It has made sporadic appearances in the Iberian peninsula, and seropositive cattle have been detected in Canada. Cattle, sheep, and goats are the susceptible domestic species wherever bluetongue occurs. Infection in cattle usually produces only inapparent infection or mild clinical disease. Goats, though susceptible to infection, rarely show signs; however, significant disease has occurred in goats in the Middle East and India. Sheep are the domestic species most highly susceptible to bluetongue, but there is considerable variation in expression of the disease, depending on the breed, age, and immune status of the sheep, the environmental circumstances under which they are held, and the strain of virus. In Africa, a wide variety of nondomestic ungulates and some small mammals may be inapparently infected; mortality has occurred in naturally or experimentally infected topi, cape buffalo, and kudu. In North America, wildlife species, particularly whitetailed deer, black-tailed or mule deer, elk (wapiti), bighorn sheep, and pronghorn antelope, are also infected. Bluetongue is responsible for significant mortality in all these species except elk, which usually develop mild or inapparent infection. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, or a closely related virus, has been isolated in Nigeria, but the natural vertebrate hosts there are not known. In North America, white-tailed deer, black-tailed or mule deer, pronghorn antelope, and elk are susceptible to infection. The white-tailed deer is extremely susceptible, and widespread epizootics have occurred among this species in the United States. A single outbreak has been recognized in Alberta, Canada. The rate of survival is much higher among black-tailed deer and pronghorn antelope, and elk are only very mildly affected. Clinical disease similar to that produced by bluetongue may occur in cattle, but sheep do not develop disease when infected with this virus. In Japan, the closely related virus of Ibaraki disease also produces a clinical syndrome resembling bluetongue in cattle, but not in sheep.",

Viremia about 4 -6 days after inoculation results in secondary infection of endothelium in arterioles, capillaries, and venules throughout the body, with microscopic lesions and fever beginning a day or so later, about a week after inoculation. Bluetongue virus in the blood appears to be closely associated with, or in, erythrocytes, and it may cocirculate with antibody. Endothelial damage caused by virus infection initiates local microvascular thrombosis and permeability. This is reflected microscopically by the presence of swollen endothelium, and fibrin and platelet thrombi in small vessels, with edema and hemorrhage in surrounding tissue. These lesions in turn mediate the full spectrum of gross findings. These are fundamentally ischemic necrosis of many tissues, edema due to vascular permeability, and hemorrhage resulting from vascular damage compounded, in severe cases, by consumption coagulopathy due to thrombocytopenia and depletion of soluble clotting factors.",

The enterocytes present on villi shortly after the initial exfoliative episode are mainly poorly differentiated, low columnar, cuboidal, or squamous cells, with stubby irreg-ular microvilli. Within 2 or 3 days, villi begin to regenerate and the epithelium becomes progressively more columnar, though still lacking a well-developed brush border and its complement of enzymes. Defective fat absorption is reflected in the accumulation of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of enterocytes on villi. This is particularly marked over the period of about 2 to 5 days after experimental inoculation. With progressive epithelial regeneration from the crypts, the villus fusion, which may be the result of adhesion of temporarily denuded lamina propria of adjacent villi, regresses. Separation begins along the basal margins of the adhesions and progresses toward the tips of the villi. There may be focal acute inflammation in the lamina propria of temporarily denuded villi, and a mild mononuclear infiltrate in the stroma of collapsed villi. Though several cycles of virus replication may occur, poorly differentiated enterocytes appear relatively refractory to infection, and the virus titer falls, presumably as local immune mechanisms also come into play.

Coronaviruses were at first associated with the pandemic of diarrhea in dogs in 1978, which was subsequent demonstrated to be due to canine parvovirus-2. Coronavirus is probably widely prevalent in the dog population, but a cause of diarrhea in only a minority of animals. Very few animals with lesions consistent with coronavirus infection are submitted to biopsy or come to autopsy. Viral replication is reported to occur in the enterocytes of the small intestine, and in experimental infections in neonatal puppies, the lesions resemble the villus atrophy associated with coronavirus infection in other species. Diarrhea began as early as 1 day after inoculation, and in most animals by 4 days. Onset of signs coincided with the development of moderate villus atrophy and fusion. Enterocytes on villi became cuboidal, contained lipid vacuoles, and had an indistinct brush border. Lesions were most consistent and severe in the ileum.

The disease usually occurs in young animals exposed after decay of passively acquired maternal antibody, but it may occur in naive cats of any age. Clinical signs of several days duration, including pyrexia, depression, inappetence, vomition, diarrhea, dehydration, and perhaps anemia, may be evident in the history.

The second mechanism involves enterocyte-adherent E. coli strains, which colonize the surface of epithelial cells, do not produce recognized enterotoxin, but are associated with villus atrophy. They currently are not known to occur in domestic animals. Enterotoxemic colibacillosis is represented by edema disease of swine. In this condition a toxin produced by specific strains of E. coli colonizing the small intestine is absorbed and has its pathogenic effect on tissues other than the gut. Postweaning E. coli enteritis is also caused by the same strains, presumably by different means. Enteroinvasive E. coli strains induce disease by a fourth mechanism. They have the capacity to invade the epithelium of the intestine and cause acute exudative enteritis, often endotoxemia, and perhaps terminal septicemia. Enteroinvasive colibacillosis is apparently rare in domestic animals. Septicemic colibacillosis is the final, and common, manifestation of disease caused by this organism. The intestine is not necessarily the portal of entry, and there may not be alimentary disease.

The rate of intestinal transit may also be reduced by ST-enhancing proliferation of E. coli and perhaps promoting absorption of toxin. The effect is rapid in onset and requires persistence of toxin, in contrast to that of the heat-labile toxin, which has a latent period after exposure and is relatively irreversible.",

The serotypes usually incriminated are Salmonella typhimurium, S. enteritidis, and S. dublin, the latter having often in the past been classified as S. enteritidis. These serotypes are of worldwide distribution. Salmonella dublin is not common in North America east of the Rockies, and wherever it is found it tends to show some specific adaptation to cattle and to occur in epizootics, whereas the other infections are more often sporadic. Salmonella muenster has become enzootic in cattle in Ontario and appears to be spreading to other eastern Canadian provinces and the northeastern United States. The behavior of this serotype is similar to that of S. dublin. Whatever the infecting serotype, the manifestations of infection in individual animals are the same.",

In calves, salmonellosis is a febrile disease typified by dejection, dehydration, and usually diarrhea. Diarrhea is not always present, but when it is, the feces are pulpy, yellow or grayish, and have a very unpleasant odor. In older calves there is often blood and mucus in the feces. In less acute cases there may be delayed evidence of localization in the lung and synovial structures. Morbidity and mortality may be considerable, especially in calves that are confined, such as in vealer operations.

Campylobacter invades epithelium in crypts and glands, where the bacteria lie free in the apical cytoplasm and replicate.

These form a crowded, pseudostratified columnar epithelium, with basophilic cytoplasm. Nuclei may be open and vesiculate with prominent nucleoli, or laterally compressed.

Three types of lesion are produced: hemorrhagic and infarctive, caseating, and granulomatous. Hemorrhagic and infarctive lesions are illustrated by mycotic rumenitis following grain overload in ruminants ( Fig. 1.8A,B) . They often complicate Peyer's patch necrosis in cattle with bovine virus diarrhea and are seen along the tips of the abomasal folds in calves in the later stages of bacterial gastroenteritis. The fungi have a propensity to invade mucosal and submucosal veins, producing thrombosis and necrosis. Usually there is full-thickness necrosis of the gut wall, which is edematous and blue-black due to venous stasis ( Fig. 1.11A-C) . Often there is a relatively mild inflammatory response to the fungi. Spread to the liver and other organs via portal and systemic circulations is common (Fig. 1.8D ). Mycotic ileitis and colitis in cats occasionally may be a sequel to panleukopenia. Intestinal lesions caused by the fungi (usually Aspergillus) may be hemorrhagic and necrotizing with a prominent cellular response but sometimes are small, localized, and difficult to find. In the latter cases, lesions of panleukopenia in the intestine and multifocal mycotic emboli in the lung suggest the pathogenesis. The lung appears to be the favored site of dissemination in cats.

It seems likely that the ability of the fungus to cause thrombosis and necrosis determines whether generalization occurs. In the absence of infarctive lesions, fungi may produce a localized granulomatous lesion in specialized lymphoid tissue of the Peyer's patch or may be carried to the regional lymph node while the mucosal lesion heals. In the lymph nodes, a granulomatous response with giant cells that contain hyphal fragments often develops; asteroid bodies may form around Aspergillus.

The larvae fasten themselves to the mucosa by the chitinous oral hooks, and they bore into the mucosa. They apparently subsist on blood, exudate, and detritus and produce focal erosions and ulcerations at the point of contact. These defects in the cardia are surrounded by a narrow rim of hyperplastic squamous epithelium.

Undoubtedly many are removed mechanically, and often some are found free in the ingesta. Severe infestations produce a dense, pockmarked appearance with chronic inflammatory thickening. Ulcers may occur in the glandular mucosa, and a large proportion of the pyloric mucosa may be lost. Healing occurs when the larvae migrate, but may be complicated by secondary bacterial infection. Histologically, the ulcers penetrate the submucosa, which is chronically inflamed.

At necropsy, other than the changes associated with dehydration and perhaps cachexia, findings are limited to fluid mucoid content in the upper small intestine, and soft or fluid feces in the colon. The mucosa of the duodenum is usually unremarkable or perhaps hyperemic with excess mucus on the surface. Worm counts will reveal tangled, cottony masses of elongate, lightly coiled nematodes in heavy Nematodirus infections. Clinical disease is associated with populations of about 10,000 to 50,000 or more Nematodirus worms.",

The larvae initially lie about the level of the base of the mucosa. They incite a reaction causing local loss of the muscularis mucosae, so that the nodule formed involves both mucosa and submucosa, and the larvae ultimately reside in the submucosa. The nodules are grossly about 1-20 mm in diameter, umbilicate, and may contain yellow or black, cheesy exudate in the center. An eosinophilic \"cyst\" wall surrounds the third-stage larva. Nearby lymphatics may undergo thrombosis. Once the larvae molt and begin to move to the lumen, an intense influx of eosinophils and neutrophils occurs into the nodules, and a focus of necrotic debris and fibrin lies over the evacuated nodule. Mucosal and submucosal edema cause thickening of the wall of the large bowel and contraction of the cecum.

Disease in sheep is associated with the presence of mature worms in the colon. Feces are soft, mucoid, and perhaps blood flecked, and ill thrift may occur. The adults penetrate to the muscularis mucosae and take a plug of mucosa into the buccal capsule; minor hemorrhage may be related to physical trauma to the mucosa. More significant is loss of plasma protein from the mucosa, associated with numerous focal sites of trauma, and widespread areas of mononuclear infiltration in the mucosa and submucosa. There is also hyperplasia of goblet cells. Grossly, the lesions are characterized by edema of all layers of the wall of infected parts of the colon, and enlargement of colonic lymph nodes. Worms are generally concentrated in the proximal portion of the spiral colon, and the area they inhabit may have numerous hemorrhagic foci corresponding to sites of former attachment.

Puppies may be infected by ingestion of larvated ova, in which case they follow the pathway of hepatopulmonary movement in the bloodstream, and tracheal migration to the pharynx and gut, though some larvae reach other tissues in the circulation. In older dogs, most larvae ingested in eggs are disseminated in the circulation to various tissues, where they encyst still in the second stage rather than undergoing development and a tracheal migration. In the pregnant bitch, these larvae are mobilized, crossing the placenta to infect the fetus in the 7 to 10 days before parturition. In the fetus, they molt in the liver and pass to the lungs as third-stage larvae, where they are present at birth. Transmammary transmission of mobilized second-stage larvae also occurs, infecting the neonate via the colostrum. In addition, paratenic hosts may be infected by ingestion of larvated eggs. In a wide variety of species, second-stage larvae are disseminated hematogenously to many organs, where they settle mainly in muscle. In some abnormal hosts, including humans, a syndrome termed visceral larva migrans has been described, characterized by eosinophilia, general malaise, and perhaps signs related to granulomatous reactions to larvae in the eye, liver, lungs, and brain.

Some migrate in the liver, eventually to enter the peritoneal cavity.

The coenurus is a single or loculated fluid-filled cyst, on the inner wall of which up to several hundred nodular invaginated scolices are present in clusters.

These strains seem to be based on adaptations to prey-predator relationships among definitive and intermediate hosts, which are relatively isolated geographically and ecologically. Since Echinococcus species may be self-fertilizing, they have a high potential for forming double recessives. The large number of genetically identical worms that may result from asexual reproduction by the cystic metacestode developing from a single oncosphere gives the genus a high capacity for establishment of mutant populations. These adaptive advantages may predispose to the development of strains. The species recognized are E. granulosus, E. multilocularis, E. oligarthus, and E. vogeli. The latter two involve sylvatic cycles in South America, with felids and canids as definitive hosts, respectively, and rodents as intermediate hosts.

It begins with infection of a cell, usually in the intestinal mucosa, by a sporozoite released from a sporocyst in the lumen of the gut.

Separate sexual stages or gamonts subsequently develop into nonmotile macrogametes and motile male forms or microgametes. A nonmotile zygote produced by union of microand macrogametes forms an oocyst. Sporogony, or production of sporocysts containing infectious sporozoites within the oocyst, may occur in the host, or more commonly after the resistant oocysts are passed in feces. Members of the genus Eimeria are homoxenous, sexual and asexual development taking place in a single host.

Developing meronts or schizonts are multinucle-ate. Merogony may occur by a variety of mechanisms that may or may not involve apparent \"budding\" of merozoites from the periphery of the meront or from infoldings of it. A single residual body, surrounded by slightly curved, fusiform, or banana-shaped, uninucleate merozoites, or many spherical clusters of merozoites with a central residuum, may be present. The location of a schizont, and the number of merozoites it contains, vary with the species and the generation of schizogony.

However, fully differentiated microgametes differ from merozoites in being small, densely basophilic, comma-shaped, with two or three flagella.

Macrogametes, the female stage, have a large nucleus with a prominent nucleolus and with time usually enlarge to contain refractile eosinophilic \"plastic granules\" or wall-forming bodies, which give rise to the layers of the oocyst wall.

The development of coccidiosis is a function of the innate virulence of the organism, the size and viability of the inoculum, and the susceptibility of the host. Some species of coccidia are much more commonly associated with disease than others. Species virulence reflects a number of factors. Among these are the location and type of cell infected by various stages of the organism, the function of infected cells, and the degree of host reaction stimulated by infection. The biotic potential of the organism within the host (i.e., the degree of asexual replication) coupled with the size of inoculum determines to some extent the number of cells infected by subsequent asexual and sexual generations of the coccidium.

The intercellular relationships may be affected. The rate of movement of infected epithelial cells up villi appears to be altered in some cases, and epithelial cells infected by some species seem more resistant to autolysis. At least in chickens, and perhaps in mammals, epithelial cells infected by coccidia may migrate into the lamina propria. The release of merozoites and oocysts is cytolytic, and if this is synchronous and widespread, as may occur in heavy infections, considerable loss of function may be expected. This may result in villus atrophy if many surface epithelial cells are lost, as in piglets infected by Isospora suis.

In toxoplasmosis, necrosis and focal acute or chronic inflammatory reactions may be incited by actively replicating asexual stages in many organs.

The life cycles of both agents are similar, two schizogonous generations preceding gametogony.

These schizonts may be large, up to -300 |xm in diameter, and are visible to the naked eye as pinpoint white nodular foci in the mucosa.

Merozoites released from these schizonts about 14-18 days after infection enter cells deep in cecal and colonic glands. In heavy infections, crypts of Lieberkuhn in the terminal ileum may also be infected.

They release merozoites that enter epithelium in the glands of the cecum and colon, and perhaps distal ileum. There small, second-generation schizonts evolve, and other cells in glands in the same area subsequently become infected by the gametocytes. These species are considered highly pathogenic, and E. ovinoidalis is a species often encountered in association with disease in feedlot lambs. Lesions other than those related to diarrhea, dehydration, and hypoproteinemia are limited to the terminal ileum, and especially the cecum and proximal colon, and are associated with second-generation schizogony and gametogony. Affected areas of gut are edematous and thickened, and there may be focal or more diffuse congestion and hemorrhage in the mucosa. Heavily infected animals may have bloodstained feces. Occasionally, pinpoint white foci, the giant schizonts, may be seen in the mucosa of the ileum. In sections, schizonts and gamonts are in many or most cells lining glands in affected areas. Neutrophils and macrophages may accumulate in response to merozoites released from ruptured giant schizonts, but the most significant microscopic lesions are those in the cecum and colon, which resemble those in cattle due to E. bovis and E. zuernii.",

It is a sporadic or minor cause of fatal diarrhea in other species, usually but not always occurring in the neonatal age group. Though cryptosporidiosis can be induced experimentally in piglets, it is a relatively rare cause of spontaneous disease in them. The pathologic diagnosis is based on the presence of large numbers of Cryptosporidia in sections of freshly fixed lower small intestine. Examination of smears of ileal mucosa stained with Giemsa may allow a more rapid answer or permit a diagnosis on tissue from an animal dead for some hours. In neonatal animals, other infectious causes of diarrhea should be sought at the same time.",

Infection in dogs appears to have a low prevalence, and most cases are sporadic, probably acquired by exposure to cysts in feces from infected people.

Ulcers advance as an area of necrosis and predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate, causing loss of glands, and extend for the full depth of the mucosa. Established ulcerative amoebic colitis classically has a flask-shaped ulcer, the narrow neck through the mucosa, and the broad base in the submucosa. There amoebae, and necrosis, expand laterally, apparently less constrained by the architecture of the tissue. The ragged mucosal margin of the ulcer overhangs the excavation in the submucosa. The muscularis is rarely invaded. Amoebae may attain the deeper tissue via mucosal blood vessels or lymphatics. A mixed inflammatory reaction is present about the periphery of areas of necrosis. Amoebae may be present, commonly in small clusters, in necrotic debris or in adjacent viable tissue, often not involved in an inflammatory reaction. Amoebae in tissue, often surrounded by a clear halo, may be spherical or irregular, with extended pseudopodia, and are about 6 to 40 or 50 |xm in diameter. The nucleus has a central dense karyosome and peripheral chromatin clumps. The cytoplasm may appear foamy, can contain remnants of erythrocytes in phagolysosomes, and contains glycogen, which makes the cytoplasm PAS-positive.

In young dogs and cats, in which the disease is most important, though still uncommon, the main sign is intermittent or chronic diarrhea, which may persist for several months. The stool is soft, pale, mucoid, and greasy. Though appetite is not usually impaired, there may be a reduced growth rate or weight loss, suggesting malabsorption. A poor hair coat is attributed to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins. Gastrointestinal dysfunction has not been extensively documented in animals. Some people with Giardia infection have malabsorption of d-xylose and vitamin B 1 2 , and steatorrhea and hypocarotinemia.

Although villous atrophy may occur in human patients with giardiasis, this usually occurs mainly in a subgroup of patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. Marked histologic abnormality is not found in many cases of giardiasis in humans, and this seems also to be true for dogs and cats. In experimental murine giardiasis, infection is associated with hypertrophy of crypts and increased production of cells, combined with an increased rate of movement of enterocytes along villi. Intraepithelial lymphocytes are common in infected intestine, and altered epithelial kinetics may be related to cell-mediated immune reactions in the mucosa. Atrophy of villi has been associated with restoration of cell-mediated immune competence in Giardia-infected athymic mice, suggesting that immune phenomena may be involved in the pathogenesis of giardiasis.",

A diagnosis is sometimes based on findings in biopsies of small intestine, or at autopsy. In dogs and cats, morphologic changes in the mucosa are not well defined. The mucosa may appear normal, but there may be equivocal blunting of villi, perhaps associated with a moderate infiltrate of mononuclear cells into the core of the villus, or a heavy population of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Giardia should be sought in animals with malabsorption syndromes. They lie between villi and are usually evident as crescent shapes, applied by their concave surface to the brush border of epithelial cells. In favorable sections through the level of the nuclei, they may appear to have a pair of' 'eyes.'' Trophozoites oriented along the plane of section may look as they do in smears, the paired nuclei giving the organism a facelike appearance. An abnormal number of bacteria, suggestive of overgrowth, may be present in the mucus and content in the vicinity, in symptomatic animals. A diagnosis of giardiasis should always be reserved for those cases in which no other explanation for the syndrome can be identified.
