Tobis, RN, COHN-S I n March 2003, the World Health Organization issued a global alert on an atypical pneumonia that produced a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The index SARS case was a doctor from China who was a guest in a Hong Kong hotel. Before the patient's death, he infected a family member, other hotel guests, and health care workers. 1 While more is being learned about SARS, health care workers are working to redefine personnel protective equipment that is appropriate for use with SARS. Standard Universal Precautions (eg, gloves, gowns, surgical masks, and eye shields or glasses to protect the eyes from body fluid splashes) are intended to protect from bloodborne pathogens and do not take into account the possibility of airborne transmission of diseases.",

Each employee is fit-tested for the appropriate respirator size and is provided training on how to put on, take off and how to clean the respirator. The effectiveness of a respirator will depend on a good mask-to-face seal, and OSHA requires that respirators be checked annually to determine that the fit remains acceptable. During the fitting session, employees are given several respirator options and are allowed to choose the option they prefer on the basis of comfort and adequacy of fit. Room for eye protection, to talk, and the position of the mask on the nose, face, and cheeks determine comfort. The fit of the respirator is determined by proper chin placement, adequate strap tension, fit across the bridge of the nose, ability to cover the distance from nose to chin, tendency to slip, and a seal check. 5 Not all employees will be able to wear the N95 particulate disposable respirator; therefore, they may need to be fitted with a powered air-purifying respirator. Employees may only wear the respirators for which they have been medically cleared and fit-tested. The N95 disposable particulate filter respirator should be disposed of after use.",
