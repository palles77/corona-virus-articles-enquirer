            "text": "An outbreak of aseptic meningitis occurred in the northern area of Jiangsu Province in China from January to July in 2003. A total of 1,681 cases were involved in this outbreak, and 99% of patients were <15 years of age. To identify the etiologic agent, 66 cerebrospinal fluid specimens were tested by cell culture. Eighteen showed an enteroviruslike cytopathic effect on MRC-5 human fetal diploid lung cells. An enterovirus primer-mediated reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, a standard neutralization assay, and sequencing of the complete capsidencoding (VP1) gene identified the 18 isolates (FDJS03) as echovirus 30. At least a 10% difference was seen in nucleotide sequences of VP1 between FDJS03 isolates and other global strains of echovirus 30. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete sequences of VP1 was performed to further characterize the FDJS03 isolates. This report is the first to identify a distinct lineage of echovirus 30 as a probable cause of this outbreak.",

During the past decade, numerous outbreaks of enteroviral meningitis were documented throughout the world (2) (3) (4) (5) . In China, infections with other enteroviruses are reported more frequently because wildtype polioviruses were eradicated by the expanded immunization program in 1992. Outbreaks associated with nonpolio enteroviruses have been sequentially reported in recent years (6) (7) (8) . Specific serotypes of etiologic agents were not identified in outbreaks involving nonpolio enteroviruses in China, since serotyping usually had no influence on clinical management of a given patient with an enteroviral infection. However, identification of the serotype and the molecular characteristics of the prevailing virus can provide valuable epidemiologic information in outbreak investigations. The serotype-specific immune status of the population, territorial competition among serotypes, and transmission efficiency of the virus may also be important factors influencing epidemiologic behavior of human enteroviruses (HEV) (9, 10) . An understanding of circulating virus strains in local regions would be essential in effectively controlling enteroviral infections.",

Viruses were isolated from the original clinical specimens and propagated in cell culture by standard methods (11) . Briefly, 200 \u00b5L of each CSF specimen was added in duplicate into 24-well plates covered with monolayers of each cell culture. Maintenance medium (MEM plus 2% newborn calf serum) was then added to each well. All cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 and observed daily for 7 days for an enteroviruslike cytopathic effect (CPE). In cultures exhibiting no CPE by the end of observation period, blind passage was performed for another 7 days. Passage was performed twice before the culture was reported as negative. Cultures showing an enteroviruslike CPE were passed once more for confirmation. The primary identification of positive isolates as enterovirus was done by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with 2 pairs of enterovirus general primers (12) (13) (14) , which detect nearly all types of enterovirus (12, 15) . The reference enterovirus strain used in this study was coxsackievirus B1. Positive isolates were designated Echo30-FDJS03, which was abbreviated as FDJS03.",

According to proposed molecular typing criteria (1), the limits of intraserotypic divergence should be <25% nucleotide sequence differences or <12% amino acid sequence differences.
