Moderate and strong water deficit decreased the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and biomass production. Water use efficiency and the root to shoot ratio increased significantly in response to water deficit, indicating a high tolerance to drought. Weak water deficit did not decrease root biomass production, but significantly increased the production of glycyrrhizic acid (by 89%) and liquiritin (by 125%) in the roots. Therefore, a weak water deficit can increase the yield of root medical compounds without negative effect on root growth.",

Recently, glycyrrhizic acid has been found to be highly active in inhibiting the replication of the severe acute respiratory syn drome (SARS) associated virus and has been sug gested as a potential therapeutic agent for chronic hepatitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [3] . Licorice plants appear to be highly drought tolerant, being a favorable plant to restore degraded desert, arid and semiarid ecosystems of northwest China [4] . However, data on physiological processes, such as biomass production and secondary metabolite yield, in response to environmental condi tions are lacking [5] .",

In this study, licorice plants were able to grow and pro duce biomass even at 20-30% WC (Table 2) , suggest ing that this plant can acclimate in response to unfa vorable environment and exhibit high drought resis tance. Water deficit induces partial closing of stomata and both transpiration and photosynthesis decrease, thereby slightly increasing WUE [16] , especially at 60-70% WC ( Table 1 ). The increase in the efficiency of water use under drought occurs at the expense of absolute biomass production [16] . In order to dimin ish metabolism consumption and increase uptake of water under dry conditions, plants often decrease their growth rate and biomass production, and contribute more synthesized biomass to roots, so that they could maintain a higher root to shoot ratio ( Table 2) . Parti tioning more assimilate to the underground parts and maintaining the higher root to shoot ratio may con tribute to enhanced water uptake [16] . Thus, these responses allow licorice plants to survive and even to continue to grow under conditions of water shortage, i.e., to develop drought tolerance.",

            "text": "It has been well documented that water deficit can also affect the production of secondary metabolites in some medicinal plants [10, 12, 13] . Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites is known to be affected by drought, indicating influence by environmental stim uli [10, 11] . For example, the content of several alka loids increased in response to drought in Tabernae montana pachysiphon [13] . Liu [10] also found that camptothecin concentrations briefly rose when Camp totheca acuminata seedlings experienced drought. Glycyrrhizic acid and liquiritin, the major bioactive components of G. uralensis, are accumulated in the underground parts of licorice plants [1, 2] . Thus, soil WC plays a key role in their biosynthesis. Weak water deficit significantly increased not only glycyrrhizic acid and liquiritin concentrations per gram dry weight (Figs. 1a, 1b) , but also total amount of these com pounds in plant roots (Figs. 1c, 1d) . The synthesis of secondary metabolites was stimulated under weak drought conditions. Zhu et al. [12] also found that mild water deficit significantly increased saikosaponin a and d contents in Bupleurum chinense roots. Our results confirm that weak water deficit can increase secondary metabolite contents and thereby increase the quality of medical row material.",
