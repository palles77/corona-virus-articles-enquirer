The feasibility study investigates the reliability of the state of the art heart rate measuring methods in realistic situations. Therefore, an experiment was designed and carried out on 45 subjects to investigate the effects caused by illumination, motion, skin tone, and distance variance. The experiment was conducted for two main scenarios; human-computer interaction scenario and health monitoring scenario. The human-computer scenario investigated the effects caused by illumination variance, motion variance, and skin tone variance. The health monitoring scenario investigates the feasibility of health monitoring at public spaces (i.e. airports, subways, malls). Five state of the art heart rate measuring methods were re-implemented and tested with the feasibility study database. The results were compared with ground truth to estimate the heart rate measurement error. The heart rate measurement error was analyzed using mean error, standard deviation; root means square error and Pearson correlation coefficient. The findings of this experiment inferred promising results for health monitoring of subjects standing at a distance of 500 cm.",

The applications mainly spread through, monitoring of neonatal patients, health monitoring for ergonomics, for driving assistance, monitoring while training/exercising and monitoring during human-computer interaction [5] .

Specialist utilizes technology driven modules to perform monitoring. The specialist has used technologies based on Internet-based systems, wireless sensor network, and mobile phone application and syndromic surveillance system. Fever monitoring using a thermometer or thermal camera are example of some of the common devices used to detect individuals with the infectious disease (see Fig. 1 ). Change in temperature of the human body is a pathological variation that occurs when the body is affected by a foreign agent (i.e. infectious disease).However, most of the infectious diseases are respiratory or cardiovascular diseases that affects the heart rate and breathing rate [7, 8] , such as; SARS, H1N1 influenza, swine flu, coronavirus and Ebola. Therefore the ability to monitor the heart rate of an individual remotely would be ideal to monitor potentially infected persons from mixing with large gatherings. Recently many methods have been proposed to estimate the heart rate remotely. Kranjec et al. [9] , in 2014 presented a feasibility study reporting the reliability of different remote heart rate measuring methods such as; Capacitively Coupled ECG (CCECG) [10] , Microwave Distance Measurement Method (MDM) [11] , and Ultrasound Distance Measurement method (UDM) [12] , The feasibility study was for a variable distance between 5 cm and 60 cm. Remote heart rate measuring methods have grown rapidly, and many methods using different mediums have emerged. The technological maturity along with the reliability of each of the methods are discussed in detail in [9, 13] .",

The proficiency to perform multiple sensing using single sensor has motivated researchers to make this technology sustainable [14, 1] . The application and maturity of the technology are still in progress. Digital camera based heart rate measurement method operates based on two broad principles, photoplethysmography (PPG), and ballistocardiography (BCG). The digital camera based heart rate measurement method using photoplethysmography extracts physiological signals from the heart by capturing microscopic color variations of the skin, mainly the facial area [15] [16] [17] . Ballistocardiography based methods rely on the mechanical motion of the heart. The mechanical motion contributes to a microscopic displacement of the head/face or facial skin [18, 19] . Many digital camera based heart rate measuring methods have been proposed using these two principles; a comprehensive survey and review on the details of the methods can be found in [20, 13] .",

Therefore, we performed this feasibility study to investigate real world factors that could challenge the reliability of RGB camera based heart rate measuring methods. The study investigates the reliability of the methods for challenges such as; Illumination variance and motion variance, the effects caused by different skin tones and finally, we investigate of distances variance which would be one of the major concerns on deploying RGB camera based methods for health monitoring.

However, the overall accuracy of the heart rate measurement did reduce as indicated by the Pearson correlation coefficients of Table 4 and Table 8 . The BSS based methods [2, 14] suffered largely due to failure in ROI tracking. The Viola-Jones face detector based face tracking method failed to track the face at 17 occasions. Similarly the green spectrum based PPG method [26] also failed to track the ROI at nine sessions.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the computer vision aspect of selection of ROI, ROI detection, ROI loss and ROI drift and rigid motion variation and spatial illumination variance appeared to be the main problem for heart rate measuring methods to operate at the realistic environment. Future research should be conducted to address these issue. An interesting direction would be to incorporate advanced computer vision and deep learning based method to perform face/landmark detection and tracking in realistic environments. Remote health monitoring using RGB camera would provide a cheap yet highly efficient solution for health monitoring of crowd. One could perform health monitoring at bottleneck locations of public spaces (e.g. exit and entrance of train stations, malls, and airport) or by using multiple RGB cameras at checkpoints (e.g. immigration checkpoint or ticket counters) to perform individual health monitoring.",

            "text": "The main idea of this study is to understand the effect of the realistic situation while measuring heart rate remotely. The heart rate measurement is performed by remotely extracting the physiological signals (BCG/PPG) from the human body. Understanding heart rate variability of these physiological signals can further derive respiratory and autonomic nervous system functions of the human body. Therefore the application of RGB camera based health monitoring would be encouraging as, developing a remote health monitoring method to monitor the physiological state of people in public spaces would prevent fatalities, the spread of communicable disease.
