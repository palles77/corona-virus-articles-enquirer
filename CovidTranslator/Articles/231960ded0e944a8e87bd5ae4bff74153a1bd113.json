            "text": "Artemether (AM) is an antimalarial drug derived from artemisinin (Qinghaosu), an extract of the herb Artemisia annua L., sweet wormwood. Its antiparasitic effect is that of a schizontocide and is explained by rapid uptake by parasitized erythrocytes and interaction with a component ofhemoglobin degradation resulting in formation of free radicals. It has been shown to exhibit a high clinical cure rate. Previous animal safety studies with Qinghaosu derivatives revealed dose-dependent neurotoxicity with movement disturbances and neuropathic changes in the hindbrain of intramuscularly treated dogs, rats and monkeys. Such effects have not been seen in man. The objective of our present studies was to compare the effects of high levels of AM administered to dogs p.o. versus i.m. In a pilot study 20 mg/kg/day of AM was given i.m. to groups of 3 male Beagle dogs for 5 and 30 days, respectively. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity were noted in some individual dogs from test day 23 on. One dog had to be sacrificed pre-term. Hematologic findings indicated a hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Microscopic examination demonstrated neuropathic changes only at 30 days, but not at 5 days. The animals had neuronal and secondary axonal damage, most prominent in the cerebellar roof, pontine and vestibular nuclei, and in the raphe/paralemniscal region. The affected neurons showed loss ofNissl substance, cytoplasmic eosinophilia, shrinkage of the nucleus and in advanced stages scavenging by microglia. In a subsequent experiment, AM was administered to groups of 4 male and 4 female dogs, respectively, at 8 daily doses of 0, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg i.m., or 0, 50, 150 and 600 mg/kg p.o. Neurologic signs were seen at high i.m. doses only. In most animals they were inconspicuous and consisted of reduced activity with convulsions seen in single dogs shortly before death. Neuronal damage occurred in all animals at 40 and 80 mg/kg following i.m. treatment. At 20 mg/kg minimal effects occurred in 5/8 dogs only, indicating that this level was close to tolerated exposure. No comparable lesions were observed after oral administration. Both i.m. and p.o. exposure at high dose levels was associated with a prolongation of mean QT interval of ECG, suggesting slowing of repolarization of the myocardium. Individual data indicated that in 1 of 4 females at 80 mg/kg i.m. this prolongation was above the 25 % level considered as threshold for concern. After intramuscular administration pharmacokinetics indicated peak plasma levels of AM at 2 to 4 hours postdose, slow elimination and a tendency to accumulate after repeated administration. Only low levels of the major metabolite, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), were found. AM levels in",

            "text": "Derivatives of artemisinin (Qinghaosu), an extract of the herb Artemisia annua L., or \"sweet wormwood\" (Qinghao) are promising new antimalarials currently available for the treatment of malaria caused by multiple resistant Plasmodium falciparum, with high clinical cure rate. They are now in widespread use especially in Southeast Asia where resistance to other antimalarials has become common (KAM-CHONGWONGPAISAN et al. 1997; KARBWANG et al. 1997) . Chemically, artemisinin has a sesquiterpene lactone peroxide structure. Its antiparasitic effect is explained by rapid uptake by parasitized erythrocytes and interaction with a component of hemoglobin degradation resulting in formation of free radicals. Antimalarial activity is increased by reducing the lactone oxygen to yield dihydroartemisinin (DHA), which can be further derivated to ether or ester analogues. Such derivatives include artemether (AM) and arteether (AE) which appear to have similar physical, chemical and antiparasitic properties. These agents have been shown to be effective against blood stages of the malaria parasites (schizonts) and to produce very little clinical toxicity other than changes in electrocardiogram (ECG). AE was selected by the US Army and the World Health Organization for development as a remedy of severe malaria (BREWER et al. 1994a) .",

In these animal studies the compound was administered parenterally and over a prolonged time period. In contrast, clinical trials indicated rapid clearing of parasites thereby limiting treatment to few days only. This difference in treatment duration between intramuscular animal studies and the clinical situation greatly impedes risk assessment based on such data. Using a short administration period to compare both clinical and pathologic effects and the pharmacokinetics of oral and intramuscular routes of administration is considered a better basis for extrapolation to man, and for estimating a safety margin for neurotoxic effects of AM when used as intended in clinical trials. Therefore, in the present experiments treatment was limited to 8 days which is closer to the maximum 5 day treatment intended for humans, but long enough for neural lesions to develop (BREWER et al. 1994a) . Experiments with AM in dogs described in this report demonstrate characteristic neural lesions after high-level intramuscular treatment and their total absence following oral administration.",

Most extensive lesions occurred in the prematurely sacrificed dog: they involved also the regions of the lateral geniculate body, substantia nigra, nucleus ruber and even the neurons in gray matter of the lumbar spinal cord. The changes affected the nerve cell bodies. There were only few occasional degenerating nerve fibers probably representing secondary degeneration of processes of damaged neurons. The affected neurons were characterized by loss of basophilic staining, probably reflecting loss or dissolution of Nissl bodies. Their perikarya were eosinophilic in hematoxylin and eosin and pale in cresyl violet stain. Such chromatolytic neurons showed occasional nuclear eccentricity, a feature resembling \"axonal reaction\" (figs. 1 and 2). The advanced lesions were characterized by shrinkage of the nuclei and fragmentation of the cytoplasm. Silver stain demonstrated clumping and break-down of the perikaryal neurofilaments. Such necrotic neurons were surrounded by scavenging microglia cells, forming characteristic microglial nodules, positive for RCA-l lectin binding reaction (figs. 3 to 6). In the peripheral nerves, no lesions were found. The brain of the prematurely sacrificed animal showed additional lesions in the cortex and hippocampus with features of ischemic neuronal change, which probably were non-specific and associated with the debilitated condition of this animal.",

This is in accordance with the findings of GENOVESE et al. (1995) who observed normal behavioral performance in AE treated rats as measured by an operant conditioning task despite substantial neuronal damage. Similarly BREWER et al. (1994a) described that in dogs treated with AE neurological changes appeared only shortly before death. There are several factors that may contribute to the apparently normal function despite the presence of neuronal damage: 1) neuronal reserve capacity and/or the capability of the nervous system to compensate for lost neurons and 2) some areas affected are involved mainly in auxilliary functions. In the absence of early clinical signs that could act as warning signals, neurotoxicity induced by intramuscular AM has to be evaluated with great caution. The neurotoxic changes were restricted to the central nervous system and affected primarily the nerve cell bodies, so that the lesion can be classified in terms of cellular targets as \"neuronopathy\". The early change, characterized by dissolution of Nissl bodies and occasional nuclear eccentricity resembled \"axonal reaction\" known to occur in response to damage ofaxons. However, whereas in axonal reaction the rough endoplasmic reticulum rearranges at the neuronal periphery in order to produce cytoskeleton needed for reconstitution of the damaged axon (KRINKE et al. 1985; KRINKE and FITZGERALD 1988) , such rearrangement did not occur in AM toxicity. It is quite possible that an initial partial neuronal damage in AM toxicity triggers some of the signals involved in axonal reaction and that transduction of such signals results in similar remodeling of neuronal soma. The features of neuronal changes resembled pathology known to occur in spontaneous motor neuron diseases such as amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS) ",

Neuropathologic changes were found in these animals as well proposed to playa role in the etiology of ALS, specifically a malfunction of superoxide dismutase, resulting in surplus of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals or peroxynitrite damaging the neurons (CEBALLOS-PICOT 1997). Since oxidative mechanisms are involved in the antiparasitic effect of AM, it is conceivable that the toxic effect of AM could employ similar mechanisms acting on the neurons after excessive exposure. The reasons for selective distribution of the lesion in the brain, affecting the lower brain stem and preserving the upper brain stem and the cortex, are unclear. It may reflect selective vulnerability of the affected neurons, uneven distribution of AM in the brain, or both. The explanations of the mechanisms involved in neuronal damage due to oxidative stress usually consider triggering of apoptosis. In our studies however, nuclear shrinkage occurred rather than karyorrhexis which is known to result form apoptosis. In AM neuropathy the early microscopic changes appear to affect the cytoplasm and apoptosis does not seem to play any significant role. Therefore, to mitigate an overdose of AM, scavengers of free radicals could be relevant antidotes rather than agents inhibiting apoptosis.",

In contrast to earlier reports (BREWER et al. 1994a ) no inversion of the T-wave was observed. Prolongation of the QT interval in the absence of any effect on QRS-interval indicates that the ST-interval is prolonged selectively which reflects slowing of ventricular repolarization. Similar effects are known from other pharmaceuticals such as quinidine or procaine. For these two compounds a prolongation of the QT interval of 50 % and more is associated with the danger to provoke syncopes or sudden death while a 25 % increase is considered as threshold for concern. Compared to their pretest values QT _500 interval was prolonged by 25 % or more in 1 of 4 females each at 80 mg/kg i.m. (137 %) and at 40 mg/kg i.m. (125 %), while after oral administration prolongation was below 25 % in all animals. Using a 25 % prolongation as criterion for adversity, only the increase in the QT _500 interval observed after i.m. administration of 80 mg/kg of artemether is considered to be of toxicological relevance. Although available data do not allow to elucidate the mechanism underlying these ECG changes, it is interesting to note that prolongation of QT intervals occurred both after intramuscular and oral administration and therefore appears unrelated to neurotoxicity which is observed after i.m. administration only.",
