            "text": "BACKGROUND: Evaluation of interindividual variability is a challenging step in risk assessment. For most environmental pollutants, including perchloroethylene (PERC), experimental data are lacking, resulting in default assumptions being used to account for variability in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. OBJECTIVE: We quantitatively examined the relationship between PERC toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics at the population level to test whether individuals with increased oxidative metabolism are be more sensitive to hepatotoxicity following PERC exposure. METHODS: Male mice from 45 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) were orally administered a single dose of PERC (1,000 mg/kg) or vehicle (Alkamuls-EL620) and euthanized at various time points (n = 1=strain=time). Concentration-time profiles were generated for PERC and its primary oxidative metabolite trichloroacetate (TCA) in multiple tissues. Toxicodynamic phenotyping was also performed. RESULTS: Significant variability among strains was observed in toxicokinetics of PERC and TCA in every tissue examined. Based on area under the curve (AUC), the range of liver TCA levels spanned nearly an order of magnitude ( \u223c 8-fold). Expression of liver cytochrome P4502E1 did not correlate with TCA levels. Toxicodynamic phenotyping revealed an effect of PERC on bodyweight loss, induction of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPARa)-regulated genes, and dysregulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis. Clustering was observed among a) liver levels of PERC, TCA, and triglycerides; b) TCA levels in liver and kidney; and c) TCA levels in serum, brain, fat, and lung. CONCLUSIONS: Using the CC mouse population model, we have demonstrated a complex and highly variable relationship between PERC and TCA toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics at the population level. https://doi.",

            "text": "Interindividual variability in susceptibility to toxicity has been observed or assumed to exist for all environmental chemicals and drugs; however, little empirical data are available to quantify such differences (Zeise et al. 2013) . Traditional in vivo toxicity testing relies on the use of a single strain of rodent (typically an inbred or hybrid strain), with multiple identical animals being used at each time point or in each dose group; thus, extrapolation from these data to a diverse human population is difficult and necessitates the use of default assumptions. In the past decade, the utility of a mouse population-based approaches to in vivo toxicity testing has been demonstrated for a number of toxic agents and the appreciation of genetics as an important dimension in science and practice of investigative pharmacology and toxicology is increasing (Rusyn et al. 2010) . Importantly, genetically heterogeneous mouse models have been combined with the limited data for interindividual differences in chemical toxicity from human studies to characterize the extent of the variability , discover genetic determinants (Harrill et al. 2009 ), and understand the molecular underpinnings of toxicity (French et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "One of the most ubiquitous environmental pollutants without solid experimental data on variability in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics is tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene, PERC). PERC is a chlorinated olefin solvent with a variety of industrial applications, a ubiquitous contaminant of groundwater, soil, ambient and urban air, and is one of the most common pollutants present in many hazardous waste sites (National Research Council 2009a) . The most well-known application of PERC is in dry-cleaning. Of the approximately 32,000 dry cleaners in the United States operating as of 2006, about 28,000 ( \u223c 88%) were using PERC as a solvent (Goehl and O'Neil 2005) . Not only are workers exposed to PERC via dry-cleaning, but consumers are also potentially exposed via \"off-gassing\" of PERC from treated clothing (Sherlach et al. 2011) . PERC is therefore of great concern to public health protection agencies, including the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). PERC has been classified by IARC (2013) and the U.S. EPA (2011b) as a possible human carcinogen, mainly based on evidence for carcinogenesis from chronic studies in rodents (National Toxicology Program 1986) .",

Although there have been previous attempts at characterizing toxicokinetic variability of PERC Covington et al. 2007; Gelman et al. 1996) . Chiu and Ginsberg (2011) found that all these efforts were hampered by inadequate experimental data, leading to substantial uncertainty in the ultimate risk assessments. Moreover, variability exists in both toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics, and may be a consequence of multiple factors, including genetics. Therefore, the contribution of such factors to population level variability in both toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic responses to PERC deserves further attention.",

All animals were acquired between 6 January 2015 and 20 February 2015. Exact dates of birth, dates of acquisition, and original IDs (if applicable) are available online on the Mouse Phenome Database (see \"Data Availability\" subsection, below). Strain nomenclature is used as suggested by the nomenclature committee (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012). Of the 45 strains exposed to PERC, one animal from one strain (CC059/TauUnc) died in the 24-hr treatment group as a result of a gavage error. Comparisons between time-matched vehicle-and PERC-exposed individuals within a strain was required for data interpretation, toxicodynamic data are only presented for 44/45 strains. Animals were housed in disposable HEPA-filtered polycarbonate cages with hardword chip bedding (Sanichip, P.J. Murphy Forest Products, Bowling Green, KY) with access to food (Teklad #8,604, Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) and purified water ad libitum. The animal room was maintained on a 12-hr light/dark cycle. Animals were allowed to acclimate to the room for at least 10 days prior to beginning experimentation. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Texas A&M University. For all animal studies, exposures were conducted between 0800 and 1100 hours to limit potential diurnal variation in PERC metabolism. The in-life portion of the study was conducted over a 6-week time frame to limit seasonal variations. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the overall experimental design. Mice were administered a single dose of PERC (1,000 mg/kg) or vehicle (5% Alkamuls EL-620 in saline) by oral gavage (i.g.; 10 mL/kg). All dosing solutions were prepared fresh daily (and used within 1.5 hr of preparation) in amber glass vials with foil-lined septa to minimize adsorption of PERC to the container walls and/ or septum. For PERC-treated animals, the time points for tissue collection were 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 hr postgavage (n = 1= strain=time point); vehicle-treated mice were euthanized only at the 24-hr time point (n = 1=strain). Prior to necropsy, animals were weighed and were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of EuthasolE (3 mL/kg; Med-Vet International, Mettawa, IL) and euthanasia was performed via exsanguination through the vena cava. Serum was prepared by centrifugation using Z-gel tubes (Starstedt; Numbrecht, Germany). All other tissues were removed, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and weighed. The left lobe of the liver was separated from the other Figure 1 . Study design consisted of two groups (PERC and vehicle) and five time points (1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 hr postdosing). lobes after weighing. The kidneys, lungs, brain, and epididymal fat pads were collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For animals in the 24-hr group, small sections of left and median liver lobes and kidney were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 lm, and stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E).",

Thus, we examined transcript levels for two PPARa target genes, Cyp4a10 and Acox1, in liver tissue 24 hr following exposure (Figure 8 ). In vehicle-treated mice, levels of individual transcripts were fairly consistent among strains. Almost every strain exhibited induction of both transcripts upon PERC exposure; however, the extent of induction was highly variable for both Acox1 (GM = 1:99-fold; GSD = 1:45) and Cyp4a10 (GM = 5:02-fold; GSD = 1:64).

However, at the population level, no correlation was observed between liver PERC or TCA AUC and induction of these genes. Importantly, liver triglyceride level and liver PERC and TCA AUCs were clustered together, suggesting that either parent chemical or metabolite may be responsible for the observed dysregulation of hepatic lipids. Coincident with this finding was the observation of a negative, albeit weak, correlation between serum triglycerides and PERC and TCA AUCs in the liver. When all toxicodynamic phenotypes were parameterized for strain-to-strain correlations, we observed several clustered subpopulations, as displayed in the heatmap ( Figure 6C ); however, overall there was no obvious clustering of strains based on hepatic TCA levels.",

In the current study, levels of PERC and TCA were measured in a large number of target and nontarget tissues, including liver, kidney, serum, brain, lung, and fat across a much larger panel of inbred strains of the CC. We found that serum TCA AUCs were highly correlated with those in fat, lung, and brain, but were uncorrelated to those in liver and kidney.

Importantly, the extent of variability observed among inbred strains of mice intragastrically exposed to a single high dose of TCE closely approximated that predicted from PBPK models calibrated to population toxicokinetic data in humans that included both occupational (e.g., Monster et al. 1976 ) as well as lower, more environmentally relevant exposures (Chiu et al. 2007 ). Therefore, population-based PBPK modeling of rodent-derived toxicokinetic data is useful for understanding interindividual variability in toxicokinetics among the human population, and potentially applicable to risk assessment by replacing the \"uncertainty factors\" with values based on chemical-specific data. Specifically, data-derived estimates for toxicokinetic variability could conceivably be made by incorporating the current population-level data into a population PERC PBPK model. Because of the single high dose level in this study, such a PBPK model would likely to be incorporate previously collected data (Chiu and Ginsberg 2011) in a Bayesian manner.

In this study, we measured hepatic levels of CYP2E1 in vehicleand PERC-treated mice 24 hr after dosing. Hepatic protein levels of CYP2E1 in vehicle-treated mice were variable across strains, and overall there was no effect of PERC treatment on modulation of hepatic CYP2E1 levels. Similarly, Philip et al. (2007) reported no effect of PERC treatment on hepatic CYP2E1 levels. When hepatic CYP2E1 levels in vehicle-treated mice were correlated by strain to hepatic TCA AUCs, there was no correlation at the population level (Spearman's rho = \u2212 0:01), suggesting that CYP2E1 may not be a major contributor to PERC metabolism to TCA. Indeed, in human lymphoblastoma-derived MCL-5 cells transfected with various human CYPs (hCYP), hCYP2B6 (and, to a lesser extent, hCYP2C8 and hCYP1A2) was able to catalyze the reaction of PERC to acetylated neoantigens, which Figure S2 for concentration-time profiles).

Specifically, this is the first study to use CC mice to perform parallel and tissue-specific toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic phenotyping at the population level. Using this approach, the variability in toxicokinetics of PERC in multiple tissues across a population was quantified. Utilizing an inbred mouse population model permits genetically identical individuals to be tested at multiple time points, with different doses, and with different chemicals, thereby increasing statistical power and confidence and allowing chemical-to-chemical comparisons. Even though such a study design does not yield toxicity phenotypes that are more traditionally used for human health assessments, it serves as a prerequisite step to subsequent sub-chronic and chronic studies. By assaying a large number of genetically diverse but genetically defined individuals through an acute study design one can select a smaller set of strains that are representative of the diversity in toxicokinetics for the follow up studies. For instance, subpopulations of strains based on a particular phenotype (e.g., hepatic TCA levels) can be selected for a 90-day study where the use of a large number of strains would be challenging because of ethical and financial considerations.",
