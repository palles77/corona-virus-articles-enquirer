The availability of reagents for detection of cytokines has increased considerably during recent years, also for domestic species such as the pig (Murtaugh, 1994, Myers and Murthaugh, 1995) . Porcine cytokines and their regulation are however not solely of interest in the field of veterinary medicine, since swine are increasingly used in models of human disease (Misfeldt and Grimm, 1994) and are also potential donors for xenotransplantation (Sachs, 1994) . The production of several porcine cytokines can be induced and studied in vitro (La Bonnardihre et al., 1994; Murtaugh, 1994) but results obtained under such conditions are not necessarily reflecting the in vivo situation. Thus, reliable and practical models for in vivo studies of porcine cytokines would be beneficial for a better understanding of the initiation and regulation of immune responses.",

In the tissue chamber models, perforated chambers create artificial, fluid filled, compartments in e.g. the subcutaneous tissue (Clarke, 1989) . A variety of such chambers have been used in several species, most of the models being developed for pharmacological studies, but some types have also been used for other purposes. For instance, tissue chambers have been used to monitor cellular and cytokine responses to infections and other inflammatory stimuli in mice (Dawson et al., 1993) ; guinea-pigs (Vaudaux et al., 1992) ; and horses (Higgins et al., 1987) .",

Similar chambers have also been used in rabbits, dogs, rats and sheep (Calnan et al., 1972; Chisholm et al., 1973; Piercy, 1978) . The fluid in such chambers is considered a product of the young capillary network of the granulation tissue invading the chamber and communicates with the general interstitial fluid compartment.

The infections were in eight of these chambers detected close to surgery, before or at the first occasion of sampling. The other two chambers became infected during the course of the experiments. From all but one of the infected chambers Staphylococcus hyicus was isolated, from the other chamber Streptococcus equisimilis was isolated. These local infections developed into abscesses that healed without residues after removal of the chamber. Infected tissue chambers were excluded from the experiments and removed from the pig. The anatomical location of the tissue chambers, i.e. flank or lateral neck, did not influence the incidence of post operative infections, sample collection procedure or the cellular and cytokine responses in the TCF.",

In total, 36% of the implanted chambers became infected with bacteria commonly present on the skin of pigs. However, only two chambers became infected during the experiments, which indicates that infections seldom were introduced by the sample collection. Instead, it is more likely that the close proximity between chamber and the skin wound augmented the risk for infections, especially in the second set when the pigs had four chambers implanted and thus rested on the wounds before they had healed. By only implanting tissue chambers on one side of the pigs, post surgical infections of the wound appeared to be less frequent according to the first and second set of the present study, possibly because the animals could rest on the non operated side. When a similar model was used on larger animals, i.e. cattle (Bengtsson et al., 1984) the frequency of infected tissue chambers was initially about 10%. This figure was further reduced to almost nil, by extending the distance between the tissue chamber and the skin wound (Bengtsson, personal communication, 1996) and by introducing antibiotic treatment of the animals during the pre-and post-operative period (Bengtsson, 1990) . Consequently, precautions could be taken to reduce the risk of post-operative infections also in the porcine model. For instance, it might be beneficial to use larger/older pigs to operate on. The cytokine responses were studied in TCF after administration of fixed ADV-infected PK15 cells or poly 1:C which both are known to induce the production of Type I IFNs. In addition, poly 1:C can induce the production of several other cytokines such as TNF and IL-6 (Bunning et al., 1990; North et al., 1991; Pyo et al., 1993) . In the present experiments, the kinetics of IFN-a and TNF could be monitored simultaneously in tissue chambers injected with poly 1:C. The highest levels of TNF were achieved in the first sample and then gradually decreased while the EN-(Y levels were increasing during the first three occasion of sampling. Thus, the sample collection procedure marginally affected the kinetic and magnitude of the cytokine responses. The poly 1:C induced IFN-a production in TCF was however delayed compared with that earlier recorded after systemic administration of this inducer. The highest IFN levels were then recorded already 2 to 4 h after intravenous injection of poly 1:C in pigs (Vengris and Mare, 1972; Loewen and Derbyshire, 1986 ). This discrepancy is probably due to a more rapid degradation of the inducer when administered systemically. In fact, rapid hydrolysis of poly 1:C by serum ribonucleases has been observed in humans (Nordlund et al., 1970) . A further advantage of the tissue chamber model could therefore be that metabolization of substances, in for instance the liver, could be avoided or delayed.",

An individual variation in the IFN-(w production was similarly observed after intra-dermal administration of ADV-PKl5 in pigs (Artursson et al., 1995) and is well documented for IFN-a production of porcine leukocytes when induced in vitro (Edfors-Lilja et al., 1994; . Indeed, leukocytes obtained from the pig which did not produce any detectable amounts of IFN-a in TCF after the primary injection of ADV-PKl5, responded poorly to IFN-LU induction in vitro. When a second injection of ADV-PK15 was administered in the tissue chambers 2 weeks after the primary injection, the IFN-cx response was abolished. This inhibition of the IFN-a responses was most likely due to the presence of antibodies to ADV in the TCF at this time, since antibodies to certain viral glycoproteins can inhibit IFN-a production in vitro (Lebon, 1985; Charley and Laude, 1988; Ankel et al., 1994) . In contrast, markedly higher IFN-(Y levels were noticed after ADV-PK15 induction in the bacterially infected tissue chamber. The magnitude of the IFN-a response can be increased in vitro by addition of other cytokines to the cell cultures (Cederblad and Aim, 1991; Charley et al., 1994; Wattrang et al., 1995) and enhanced IFN production has been observed during bacterial infections in man (Ikossi-O'Connor and Chadha, 1984) . Thus, 'priming' effects on the IFN-a producing cells by inflammatory cytokines could explain the high IFN-a levels in the infected tissue chamber.",

However, IFN-y was recorded in the TCF 2 weeks after injection of ADV-PKl5 in one of the pigs and in serum and TCF of both experimental pigs 2 months after the injections. These systemic and long-lasting IFN-y responses suggest an on-going immune response, possibly triggered by locally preserved antigens. In contrast, the IFN-(Y and TNF responses induced in the experiments stayed localized to the tissue chamber in question, allowing the animal to be its own control during short term experiments.",

During frequent sample collection the total number of TCF cells remained rather constant although the proportion of neutrophilic granulocytes increased. Immunofluorescence labeling confirmed the shift in TCF cell composition, determined by histologic characterization of the TCF cells. For instance, the proportion of granulocytes expressing the MIL2 antigen, which among granulocytes only is present on neutrophils (Haverson et al., 1994) increased. Moreover, the proportion of granulocytes expressing the MIL4 antigen, which is present on the majority of eosinophils but only on 50% of the neutrophils (Haverson et al., 19941 , decreased after sample collection. The most prominent changes in TCF cell numbers were however the rapid increases in neutrophil number and proportional increase of MIL2+ mononuclear cells observed after injection of poly I:C.
