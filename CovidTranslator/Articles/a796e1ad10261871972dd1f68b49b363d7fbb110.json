            "text": "A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) assay was developed to detect and distinguish feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline bocavirus (FBoV) and feline astrovirus (FeAstV). Three pairs of primers were designed based on conserved regions in the genomic sequences of the three viruses and were used to specifically amplify targeted fragments of 237 bp from the VP2 gene of FPV, 465 bp from the NP1 gene of FBoV and 645 bp from the RdRp gene of FeAstV. The results showed that this mPCR assay was effective, because it could detect at least 2.25-4.04 \u00d7 10 4 copies of genomic DNA of the three viruses per \u03bcl, was highly specific, and had a good broad-spectrum ability to detect different genotypes of the targeted viruses. A total of 197 faecal samples that had been screened previously for FeAstV and FBoV were collected from domestic cats in northeast China and were tested for the three viruses using the newly developed mPCR assay. The total positive rate for these three viruses was 59. 89% (118/197). From these samples, DNA from FPV, FBoV and FeAstV was detected in 73, 51 and 46 faecal samples, respectively. The mPCR testing results agreed with the routine PCR results with a coincidence rate of 100%. The results of this study show that this mPCR assay can simultaneously detect and differentiate FPV, FBoV and FeAstV and can be used as an easy, specific and efficient detection tool for clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigation of these three viruses.",

To date, the population of domestic cats kept by humans worldwide is estimated at 80-400 million [17] , and humans are increasingly paying more attention to the health of cats. Viral diarrhea is common in cats, especially in young kittens, and it is also a major threat to their health. It is commonly recognized that feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) is the major virus that causes diarrhea in cats [21] . Over the past few years, more diarrhea-related viruses, such as feline bocavirus (FBoV) [10] , feline astrovirus (FeAstV) [11] and feline kobuvirus (FeKoV) [4] , have been described in cats, and new detection techniques have been developed and applied [17] .",

            "text": "FPV, a member of the species Carnivore protoparvovirus 1, which belongs to the genus Protoparvovirus within the family Parvoviridae, is a highly contagious pathogen in domestic and wild cats [1] . FPV is transmitted by the faecal-oral route and primarily infects young kittens aged 3-6 months [15, 21] , resulting in severe enteric and immunosuppressive diseases characterized by fever, depression, anorexia, vomiting, acute diarrhea, haemorrhagic enteritis and leukopenia [16] . At present, FPV is widely spread throughout the world, with a high mortality rate of 25% to 90% [18] , 1 3 and represents a serious threat to the life and health of cats. Furthermore, infections with canine parvovirus 2a, 2b and 2c (CPV-2a, -2b and -2c) have also been described in domestic cats in many countries [18] . CPV-2 and FPV belong to the same viral species, Carnivore protoparvovirus 1, within the family Parvoviridae [6] . FeAstV, species Mamastrovirus 2, belongs to the genus Mamastrovirus within the family Astroviridae and is a non-enveloped, single-stranded positive RNA virus [11] . FeAstV was first reported in 1981 in faeces from diarrheic cats [9] , and a novel FeAstV genotype was found in 2012 [11] ; however, studies on FeAstV pathogenicity are limited. FBoV was first detected in a stray cat in Hong Kong in 2012 [10] and has been reported in the USA [27] , Portugal [17] , Japan [22] and China [25] . According to the latest report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), FBoV-1, FBoV-2 and FBoV-3 have been recognized as members of the species Carnivore bocaparvovirus 3, 4, and 5, respectively, within the genus Bocaparvovirus [5] , based on the amino acid sequence of the complete NS1 gene [25] . Epidemiological investigations in different countries have suggested that FeAstV and FBoV may cause diarrhea in cats with a prevalence of 4.8%-23.4% [3, 14, 20, 24] and 5.5%-25.9% [10, 22, 25, 27] , respectively, and coinfections with FPV, FBoV and FeAstV are also common in cats with diarrhea. Because of the similar clinical symptoms and frequency of coinfections with these three viruses, differentiation of these viruses during clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigations is difficult.",

            "text": "PCR has become the most widely used method for detection of pathogens due to its high sensitivity and specificity. Routine PCR/RT-PCR methods for detection of FPV, FeAstV and FBoV have been described in previous reports [12, 16] , but ??there have been no reports of?? the application of routine PCR for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of these three viruses. Multiplex PCR (mPCR) can simultaneously detect and distinguish two or more target viruses in one reaction, can save time and cost, and has been widely used in large-scale epidemiological investigations [8, 28] . In the present study, a mPCR assay was developed by combining three pairs of universal primers targeting different members of the species Carnivore protoparvovirus 1, FBoV and FeAstV in one reaction. This mPCR assay can be used as an easy and effective method for the detection and differentiation of these three viruses in clinical samples.",

Highly conserved regions of the same virus were discovered by multiple alignment using the MEGA 7.0 software. Then, three pairs of specific primers based on the conserved regions of these viruses, the VP2 gene of FPV, the NP1 gene of FBoV, and the RdRp gene of FeAstV, were designed for the mPCR assay. Primer Blast and MFE primer software were used to determine the T m value and specificity of these primer pairs. The nucleotide sequences of the primers are provided in Table 1 .",

FPV is generally considered in the clinical diagnosis of viral diarrhea in cats, while other viruses are often ignored in clinical testing. Recently, some novel enteric viruses, including FBoV, FeAstV and FeKoV [13] , were found in domestic cats, and studies suggest that these viruses are associate with viral diarrhea in cats. Over the last two years, our laboratory has investigated the prevalence of new feline enteric viruses in northeast China and has found that FBoV and FeAstV are widespread in China, with a high prevalence of approximately 25% [24, 25] . Furthermore, coinfections with FPV, FBoV and FeAstV were also found to be frequent in our investigation. However, there is no scientific detection assay to test for the three viruses. Therefore, a multiplex PCR assay that can simultaneously detect and differentiate FPV, FBoV and FeAstV in one reaction was developed and evaluated in the present study.",

M, DL2000 DNA marker so primer design and selection are critical for the development of multiplex PCR assays. In this study, three pairs of primers targeting highly conserved regions of the genomic sequences of FPV, FBoV and FeAstV were designed to detect different genotypes of the same virus. The primers' annealing temperature and amplicon length were also evaluated using the online software MFE primer. The primer combination produced amplicons of 237 bp for FPV, 465 bp for FBoV and 645 bp for FeAstV, which were easy to distinguish from one another by electrophoresis using 2.0% agarose gels. Then, a multiple PCR method with this primer combination was established by optimizing the reagent concentration and reaction conditions.",

We think that primer competition affects the specificity and sensitivity of mPCR. Second, the epidemiological investigations of feline diarrhea-associated viruses performed in our laboratory suggest that the prevalence of FPV, FBoV and FeAstV is higher in healthy and diarrheic cats and that mixed infections with these three viruses are common in clinical cases. The establishment of this method provides a convenient and advantageous test for epidemiological investigations of these three viruses.
