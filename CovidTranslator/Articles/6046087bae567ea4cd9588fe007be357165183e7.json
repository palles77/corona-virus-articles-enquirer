[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The most widely used assay format is the fluorescence-based detection, which measures either the PCR-product accumulation in real time or at the end of a given amplification reaction. The analytical signal can be generated by using intercalating dyes (e.g. SYBR green I) that become fluorescent when bound to double-stranded DNA. [11] The method is simple and cost-effective with a single reagent used for signal generation, but can be susceptible to false-positives (e.g., from primer-dimer formation). Alternatively, sequencespecific fluorescent probes (e.g., Taqman, Molecular beacon, LightCycler, and Scorpions probes) can be used to improve the accuracy. [12] This approach, however, requires separate, specialized probes (labeled fluorophore and quencher) for each nucleic acid target, thus increasing the assay cost.",

            "text": "We herein report on a new PCR-detection scheme that enables sequence-specific, costeffective detection of pathogens. The method integrates three elements: (i) a detection probe that can regulate DNA polymerase activity in the presence of a complementary target DNA, [13] [14] [15] (ii) a universal DNA reporter conjugated with a single fluorophore, and (iii) fluorescence polarization (FP) detection. When hybridized with target oligonucleotides, the detection probe binds to and inactivates DNA polymerase. The fluorophore can then be retained in the reporter DNA, and the complex assumes slow diffusional rotation, which results in high FP values. In the absence of target oligonucleotides, on the other hand, uninhibited DNA polymerase can catalyze primer extension reactions, which cleaves fluorophore from the reporter probe. The free fluorophore can rotate rapidly to lose initial, uniform polarization, which results in low FP values. The developed approach has several advantages over conventional PCR detection: (i) the assay is simple and rapid without requiring washing steps; (ii) the separation of target recognition (a detection probe) and signal generation (a universal reporter) reduces the assay cost while maintaining high specificity; (iii) the FP detection, for its ratiometric nature, is robust against environmental noise (e.g., pH, photobleaching, temperature, opacity) and can be performed in a simple homogenous assay format. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] As a proof-of-concept, we applied the FP assay to detect Salmonella bacteria. We achieved the detection sensitivity of ~1 CFU in blood samples, and were able to subtype different strains based on their genetic differences. Scheme 1 illustrates the assay procedure for bacterial detection. We chose bacterial mRNA as the primary target, because multiple copies of mRNA per bacterium would increase the likelihood of detection. We first extracted total RNA from a specimen and amplified target mRNA via a asymmetric reverse transcription (RT-) PCR. [21] We next added the all-in-one master-mix containing detection and universal reporter probes. The DNA polymerase used in the RT-PCR retained its activity [22] and could be recycled for the extension reaction on the reporter probes. The entire process can thus be performed in a single tube without washing steps. The level of fluorescence polarization (FP) was measured following an incubation step at room temperature.",

[13] Although the length of the capture sequence has negligible effect on the polymerase-inhibition, [ 13] we determined to use 30mer sequences to maximize the specificity for target Salmonella DNA. The designed probes showed no similarity to any other targets according to the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Sequence Tool) search (Table S1 in Supporting Information). We also designed primers to flank the target sequences for hybridization. For the signal detection, fluorescein-labeled DNA, its primer and template were prepared, ensuring no sequence overlap with other targets ( Figure 1A ).",

The kinetic measurement showed that the extension reaction reached a plateau 20 min after mixing detection probes and target oligonucleotides (STY3007; Figure 1B ). We thus chose 20 min as the optimal extension. As an analytical signal, we defined the differential output \u0394FP = FP -FP0, where FP0 is the fluorescence polarization of control samples containing DNA polymerase and the reporter probe only. The reaction was highly sequence-specific; we observed high \u0394FP only in the presence of target oligonucleotides ( Figure 1C ). Electrophoretic band-shift analysis [23] confirmed that detection probes, in the presence of target oligonucleotides, complexed with DNA polymerase and limited its catalytic activity ( Figure S1 in SI). We further compared two assay procedures, namely a sequential and a one-pot condition (see Methods for assay details). In the sequential assay, detection probes were first incubated with target DNA and polymerase, followed by the addition of universal reporter probes; in the one-pot assay, both detection and reporter probes were mixed together with target DNA and polymerase. The observed \u0394FP values ( Figure 1D ) were statistically identical (twotailed t-test, P > 0.76), [24] which demonstrated that PCR amplification was compatible with our detection system. The one-pot reaction was possible due to the favorable reaction kinetics: DNA hybridization has a dissociation constant in low picomolar ranges, [25] whereas DNA polymerase binds to a primer-template DNA with a dissociation constant in sub-micromolar ranges. [26] Therefore, the hybridization between the detection probe and a complementary target DNA occurs faster than the binding of DNA polymerase to a universal reporter probe. This is effectively the same reaction order in the sequential assay wherein the target DNA and the detection probe are mixed first, followed by the addition of the universal probe. We opted for the one-pot scheme, as it speeds up the assay time and is better suited for point-of-care applications.",

For example, we prepared bacterial samples through the serial dilution of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) in culture media. Following mRNA extraction and asymmetric RT-PCR (40 cycles), we added STY3007-detection and reporter probes. The measured \u0394FP signal showed CFU-dependent changes with the limit of detection (LOD) of ~1 CFU/ml ( Figure 2B ). We further spiked S. Typhimurium in human blood.

The assay is simple, modular, and cost-effective (see Table S4 in SI for comparison with other modalities). It is complete in less than 20 min at room temperature without washing steps (one-pot reaction) after the completion of PCR, and the same universal reporter can be used for different DNA targets. The FP assay's performance is comparable to that of Taqman assay, and its cost is much lower and favorable for multitarget detection (~$1 for 100 targets, Table S4 in SI). When applied to Salmonella in blood, the developed assay achieved high sensitivity (~1 CFU/mL) and could differentiate S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A. In combination with miniaturized PCR and optical detectors, [4] this assay could be a powerful platform for point-of-care pathogen detection. With judicious probe design, [27] it is also conceivable to adopt the assay to detect single-nucleotide mismatch.
