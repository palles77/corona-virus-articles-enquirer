It is worth emphasizing that pulmonary function tests do not diagnose specific diseases. Different diseases cause different patterns of abnormalities in a battery of pulmonary function tests. These patterns allow us to quantify the severity of respiratory disease, which enables us to detect disease early and characterize the natural history and response to treatment. It is important to remember, however, that these conclusions are based on inferences, not specific proofs. The accuracy of our inferences depends on a complete knowledge of the physiologic basis of the functions tested, properly validated equipment, and appropriate protocols. The purpose of this chapter is to describe these pulmonary function tests, reviewing briefly their physiologic basis, their equipment and protocol requirements, and their clinical results.",

In any occupation that is potentially hazardous to the lungs, individual workers should be monitored periodically by spirometry to detect and quantify evidence of pulmonary problems. 2. Spirometry appears to be the best method to identify smokers at risk for developing severe chronic airflow obstruction. 1 3. Spirometry can indicate the statistical risk of specific surgical procedures for a group of patients but is probably not useful for the individual patient. Arterial oxygen desaturation is a much better indicator of the probability of a high risk associated with a surgical procedure (e.g., the need for prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation) than is spirometry. 2 4. Many government agencies (e.g., the Social Security Administration) require results of spirometry to quantify impairment in patients who claim disability caused by chronic bronchitis or emphysema, as well as pneumoconioses, pulmonary fibrosis, and other pulmonary disorders. 5. Spirometric results, including peak flow rates, are extremely useful in assessing the effectiveness of treatment in asthmatic patients. These simple tests are equally valuable for quantifying the effects of treatment in patients with other forms of chronic airflow obstruction, as well as many forms of restrictive disorders. 6. Spirometry can be very sensitive for evaluating progression of disease, especially if baseline values, or results obtained early in the course of the illness, are available for comparison. Variation in the range of normal is so large that changes in serial test results are much more sensitive than a single value for detecting abnormal function. For example, changes in forced vital capacity were found to be predictive of survival time in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 3 7. Spirometry is an excellent screening test for detection of chronic airflow obstruction, localizing and grading a critical orifice in the central airways, but may also be useful in detecting restrictive disorders.",

Lung volumes and capacities are defined in Figure 25 -2. The results are obtained and displayed in a standardized manner as a spirogram (Fig. 25-3 ). Tests can be performed with a simple recording spirometer, which is inexpensive enough to be standard equipment in a physician's office or the diagnostic laboratory of a small clinic or determination as to whether the subject has a normal ventilatory reserve or an abnormal pattern characteristic of obstructive, restrictive, or mixed ventilatory abnormalities. None of these patterns is specific, although most diseases cause a predictable type of ventilatory defect. Spirometry alone cannot establish a diagnosis of a specific disease, but it is sufficiently reproducible to be useful in following the course of many different diseases. In addition, the results of spirometry make it possible to estimate the degree of exercise limitation due to a ventilatory defect (e.g., maximal Middle and bottom, Conditions at the onset of maximal flow and with increased expiratory effort, respectively. Dotted lines show static airway dimensions for comparison with the dynamic state. All three panels show pressures (cm H 2 O) at the same lung volume: 60% of total lung capacity where lung elastic recoil pressure is +16 cm H 2 O and equals the transpulmonary pressure (PL) (PL = Palv \u2212 Ppl). Top, When conditions are static, Palv is zero (i.e., atmospheric) and flow ( V ) at the mouth is zero. Middle, The subject makes a forced expiratory effort at the same lung volume. Now V is 6.5 L/sec driven by Palv of +36 cm H 2 O. Because of the resistances down the airways from alveolus to mouth, the PAW decreases to the point where PAW = Ppl (+20 cm H 2 O, which is called the equal pressure point [EPP] because Ppl = PAW). Between the alveolus and the EPP, the airways are not compressed, but distal to the EPP there is compression and airway narrowing, because Ppl exceeds the pressure within the airways. For this lung volume, 6.5 L/sec is the maximal flow possible (see discussion of bottom panel, next). Bottom, The subject makes a forced expiratory effort starting at the same volume as in the top and middle panels (PL = Palv \u2212 Ppl = +16). In this instance, the expiratory effort is markedly increased, reflected by the increased Ppl (+50 cm H 2 O) and Palv (+66 cm H 2 O). However, the flow generated is still only 6.5 L/sec because the increased effort succeeds only in compressing the airways more, dissipating the increased driving pressure across the increased resistance offered by the more narrowed airways; thus flow is maximum for this particular lung volume. On the tracing shown on the left, the subject breathes quietly (slow recording speed), then takes a maximal inspiration followed by a maximal expiration without concern for time (vital capacity). On the tracing shown to the right, after a maximal inspiration (not shown), with a rapid recording speed, the subject then exhales completely, forcefully, and as rapidly as possible (forced vital capacity). test is more clearly defined, permitting more reliable correspondence between measured and referenced values. 15 Furthermore, as demonstrated by Swanney and associates, 15 the degree of airflow obstruction, reflected in the FEV 1 / FEV 6 obtained from spirometry, can serve as an independent predictor of subsequent decline in lung function; it may therefore be used to detect smokers at higher risk for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 15 FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME OVER TIME AS A PERCENTAGE OF FORCED VITAL CAPACITY. The ratio of FEV t to total FVC has been defined precisely in healthy subjects. 16 It declines with age, but abnormally decreased ratios indicate airway obstruction; normal or increased ratios do not reliably exclude airway obstruction, particularly in the presence of hospital. Recommended criteria for acceptable performance standards for equipment have been published. 7 Although normal values have been established in a spectrum of subjects of different sex, age, size, and ethnic background, few have been reported using the standards of the American Thoracic Society (ATS). [8] [9] [10] [11] Many samples are deficient in older subjects. Almost no data exist concerning the proper prediction equations to use in individuals of foreign extraction after the family has lived in the United States for several generations. Some regression equations that include \"weight\" as a determinant yield absurd values in very obese subjects. 12 All these measurements depend heavily on patient understanding and cooperation and must be conducted by a well-trained technician able to communicate instructions clearly.",

The measurement incorporates the early, effort-dependent portion of the curve and enough of the midportion to make it reproducible and sensitive for clinical purposes. Forced expiratory volume (FEV) measurements taken at 0.5, 0.75, 2.0, and 3.0 seconds add little information to the FEV 1 measurement. The forced expiratory volume exhaled in 6 seconds (FEV 6 ) is useful, however, because it closely approximates FVC, has been shown to be a valid alternative to the conventional FEV 1 /FVC, and is easier for patients with severe airflow obstruction to attain. 14 In addition, the end of the :214, 1963. ratus permits flow-volume curves to be as readily available in the physician's office as spirometry. All of the indications for spirometry probably apply equally to the flow-volume curve. This maneuver requires the subject to inspire and expire fully with maximal effort into an instrument that measures flow and volume simultaneously. These values are plotted on the two axes of an x-y recorder or computer monitor ( Fig. 25-6 ). As summarized in Figure 25 -1, analysis of these curves has contributed to the basic understanding of the mechanical events that limit maximal exhalation. Maximal flow clearly depends on lung volume: for every point on the lower two thirds of VC, a maximal flow exists that cannot be exceeded regardless of the effort exerted by the subject. Thus maximal flow must depend on mechanical characteristics of the lungs. Flow-volume curves also provide a useful way to display ventilatory data for diagnostic purposes. By superimposition of repeated curves using graphic means or a computer, a maximal flow-volume envelope can be constructed for any subject. This envelope represents the maximal flow values of which the respiratory system is capable, and it may exceed the airflow rates achieved in any single maneuver. As illustrated in Figure 25 -7, the maximal flow-volume envelope can be approximated by having the subject make repeated trials of increasing effort or by having the subject cough repeatedly while flow-volume relationships are recorded. The flow-volume curve and FEVtime curve are mathematically interchangeable; either one can be derived graphically, or by computer analysis, from the other. This relationship can provide an internal check on the accuracy of the tests. Spirometric values can be computed from flow-volume curves. Thus values for both forced expiratory tests can be obtained with fewer efforts while still defining the maximal capacity of the respiratory system accurately. From a practical point of view, this means that the subject can generate the needed data with fewer maximal efforts and in a shorter time.",

(The FEV t /FVC ratio may also be increased in subjects who fail to make a maximal effort throughout the expiratory maneuver.) The absence of an increased ratio in patients in whom one would expect the ratio to be increased suggests the presence of concomitant airway obstruction. Absolute flow may be increased initially, probably because of outward traction of increased elastic forces on airway walls. However, because flow is volume dependent, it eventually decreases in restrictive disorders without airway obstruction, although precise quantification for the various types of pure restrictive disorders is not available.

This measurement was intended to reflect the most effort-independent portion of the curve and the portion most sensitive to airflow in peripheral airways, where diseases of chronic airflow obstruction are thought to originate. 17 These properties have gained support from clinical experience and theoretical analysis, 18 and the FEF 25%-75% is widely used currently. However, the FEF 25%-75% shows marked variability in studies of large samples of healthy subjects, and the 95% confidence limits for normal values are so large that they limit its sensitivity in detecting disease in an individual subject. 6, 19 Flow-Volume Relationships GENERAL PRINCIPLES.

A heavy dashed line connects two points on the volume-time curve of the forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuver. One point is marked when 25% of the FVC has been exhaled (2 L); the other point is marked when 75% of the FVC (6 L) has been exhaled from the level of maximal inhalation indicated by the solid line (a). In this example, the elapsed time between these two points is 1 second; thus the calculated FEF 25%-75% is 4 L/sec. FEV 1 , forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Peak Expiratory Flow Rate. Expiratory flow reaches a transient peak early in the forced expiratory maneuver. Peak flow manifests during the most effort-dependent portion of the expiratory maneuver, so decreased values can result from even slightly submaximal effort rather than from airway obstruction. Nevertheless, the ease of measuring peak flow with an inexpensive, small, portable device 20 has made it a popular means of following the pattern of airflow obstruction on an ambulatory basis. For example, the test is used to monitor patients suspected of having occupational asthma and those who seem insensitive to the severity of bronchospasm. When a maximal effort is made, peak flow is largely a function of the caliber of large airways; it is also influenced by the transient flow caused by expulsion of air from compressed central airways. For these reasons, peak flow is abnormally decreased only in moderate to severe airway obstruction.",

It appears to have prognostic value in preoperative evaluation, possibly because the extrapulmonary factors to which it is sensitive are also important for recovery from a surgical procedure. 24 It also provides a measure of respiratory muscle endurance that may be important in the evaluation of respiratory muscle fatigue, whether from obstructive or restrictive ventilatory defects or from specific neuromuscular diseases. 25 In myasthenia gravis, for example, the patient can often produce maximal efforts for a short time, so that FVC and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures are normal. However, the effort cannot be sustained, so the MVV or repeated FVC values decrease, even within 12 to 15 seconds. The respiratory crisis of myasthenia gravis may happen rapidly and lead to respiratory failure. As a result, some investigators have suggested that MVV should never be measured in patients with myasthenia gravis, except under carefully controlled circumstances when it may be useful in evaluating treatment. 6 maximum midway through inspiration and then decreasing as inhalation proceeds to TLC. It is less influenced by diffuse airway or parenchymal disease. When central airway obstruction is suspected, the inspiratory limb of the flow-volume curve has great diagnostic usefulness, whereas ordinary spirometry reveals a nonspecific pattern. OBSTRUCTIVE VENTILATORY DEFECTS. Some studies suggest that early asymptomatic airway obstructive disorders may be associated with decreased maximal flow at low lung volumes, 26 but sufficient numbers of anatomic studies that correlate findings in patients with emphysema and with central and peripheral airway lesions are not available. 17, 27 The variability of the flow-volume curve at low lung volumes has made it difficult to interpret individual curves even when compared with studies of large populations. 28 In patients with obstructive ventilatory patterns, peak flow is diminished. However, it is probable that abrupt emptying of large central airways associated with vigorous exhalation causes these central airways to be compressed, generating a brief period of relatively high flow, which preserves peak flow relative to flow at lower lung volumes. Furthermore, the usual linear descent of the flow-volume curve is disrupted by an exaggerated concavity of the descending limb of the curve. This curvilinear portion of the lower half of the flow-volume curve is characteristic of obstructive ventilatory patterns and suggests the presence of airflow obstruction even when the FVC, FEV 1 , and FEV 1 /FVC ratio are well preserved. 29,30,30a This loss of linearity relates to the severity of the obstruction as well as the type of disease. A decrease in volume is seen in conjunction with both obstructive and restrictive ventilatory defects, reflecting decreased VC. The decrease is relatively less in airway obstruction than in restrictive ventilatory defects, so the characteristic flow-volume curve in obstructive ventilatory defects tends to have its major axis oriented along the horizontal (volume) axis; in restrictive defects, the major axis appears to be along the vertical (flow) axis (see \"Pathophysiologic Patterns\" section).",

            "text": "Gas Dilution Methods. The two most commonly used gas dilution methods for measuring lung volume are the open-circuit nitrogen (N 2 ) method and the closed-circuit helium (He) method. Both methods use a physiologically inert gas that is poorly soluble in alveolar blood and lung tissues, and both are most often used to measure functional residual capacity (FRC), the volume of gas remaining in the lung at the end of a normal expiration. In the open-circuit method, UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION: STENOSIS AND MALACIA. Flowvolume curves may be especially helpful in identifying tracheal or other upper airway lesions as a cause of obstruction. 31 Central airway obstruction (i.e., proximal to the tracheal carina) that is located within the thorax produces a plateau during forced exhalation instead of the usual rise to and descent from peak flow ( Fig. 25-8 ). When more than 50% of the VC has been exhaled, the curve then follows the usual flow-volume envelope to RV. In patients with stridor, particular attention should be paid to the configuration of the inspiratory portion as well as the expiratory portion of the flow-volume curve. Lesions located in the trachea within the thorax cause decreased airflow particularly during exhalation; during inhalation, the posterior tracheal membrane is pulled out by negative intrathoracic pressure, so increased effort increases airflow rates and the inspiratory limb of the flow-volume curve can appear normal. Conversely, tracheal lesions located outside of the thorax cause decreased airflow during inhalation; during inhalation, the tracheal membrane is sucked in and is usually associated with stridor. It is possible to estimate the diameter of a stenotic lesion by analysis of the flow-volume curve with an accuracy of \u00b11 mm (eFig. 25-1), but the length of the flow-limiting segment must be confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan to plan surgical correction, if required. Because a critical orifice located at the thoracic outlet is not affected by pressure above or below the lesion, airflow is limited equally during both inhalation and exhalation. 32 Similarly, if a lesion is fixed and not altered by surrounding pressures, whether intra-or extrathoracic, airflow should be limited equally during inhalation and exhalation. RESTRICTIVE VENTILATORY DEFECTS. The increase in lung elastic recoil that accounts for the decrease in VC seen with restrictive defects also increases the force driving expiratory flow and pulling outward on airway walls; thus, the usual flow-volume curve in restrictive ventilatory defects is tall and narrow. Peak expiratory flow is relatively preserved, and the descending portion of the expiratory limb is linear, decreasing rapidly from peak flow to RV. The loop often GAS DENSITY. Comparison of flow-volume curves obtained when the subject is breathing air and breathing low-density gas mixtures such as \"heliox\" (80% helium, 20% oxygen) has been advocated to detect early airway obstruction 33 or localize the site of obstruction. 14 During a forced exhalation, when flow limitation develops in large central airways where flow is turbulent, a low-density gas such as heliox increases maximal flow (defined by the increased maximal flow at 50% VC, or \u2206 Vmax 50% ). As lung volume decreases, the flow-limiting segment moves into small peripheral airways, where flow is laminar and density independent. At this lung volume, air and heliox flow-volume curves can be superimposed; the lung volume at which flow becomes density independent is called the volume of isoflow. Clinical application of heliox in detecting airflow obstruction is generally not performed because a number of controversial issues have not been resolved. [34] [35] [36] ( Fig. 25-10) , the theory is similar. The subject rebreathes a gas mixture containing helium, a physiologically inert tracer gas, in a closed system until equilibration is achieved. If the volume and concentration of helium in the gas mixture rebreathed are known, measurement of the final equilibrium concentration of helium permits calculation of the volume of gas in the lungs at the start of the maneuver.",

This type of plethysmograph has a closed chamber with a fixed volume all exhaled gas is collected while the subject inhales pure oxygen. By assuming values for the initial concentration of nitrogen in the lungs (alveolar nitrogen fraction varies slightly with the respiratory quotient but is assumed to be approximately 0.81) and, for the rate of nitrogen elimination from blood and tissues (about 30 mL/min), measurement of the total amount of nitrogen washed out from the lungs permits the calculation of the volume of nitrogencontaining gas present at the beginning of the maneuver (Fig. 25-9 ). In the closed-circuit helium dilution method Figure 25-9 Open-circuit nitrogen method to measure functional residual capacity. Dots represent nitrogen (N 2 ) molecules. A, Initially all the N 2 molecules are in the lungs (as 80% N 2 ). B, When N 2 -free oxygen (\"pure O 2 \") is breathed, the N 2 molecules are washed out of the lungs and collected with the O 2 as expired gas in the spirometer. The spirometer contains 40,000 mL of mixed expired gas with a N 2 concentration of 5%. Thus the spirometer contains 0.05 \u00d7 40,000 = 2000 mL of N 2 ; the remaining 38,000 mL of gas is mainly O 2 used to wash the nitrogen out of the lungs, plus some carbon dioxide. The 2000 mL of N 2 was distributed within the lungs at a concentration of 80% N 2 when the washout began; therefore the alveolar volume in which the N 2 was distributed was 2000/0.8 mL = 2500 mL. Corrections must be made for the small amount of N 2 washed out of the blood and tissue when O 2 is breathed and for the small amounts of N 2 in \"pure O 2 .\" An advantage of the open-circuit method is that it also permits an assessment of the uniformity of ventilation of the lungs by analyzing the slope of the change in nitrogen concentration over consecutive exhalations, by measuring the end-expiratory concentration of nitrogen after 7 minutes of washout, 38 or by measuring the total ventilation required to reduce end-expiratory nitrogen to less than 2%. 39 The open-circuit method is sensitive to leaks anywhere in the system (especially at the mouthpiece) and to errors in measurement of nitrogen concentration and exhaled volume. If a pneumotachygraph is used to measure volume, attention must be paid to the effects of viscosity changes in the exhaled gas, because it contains a progressively decreasing concentration of nitrogen. The opencircuit method shares several disadvantages with the closed-circuit method: it does not measure the volume of gas in poor communication with the airways (e.g., lung bullae); it assumes that the volume at which the measurement was made corresponds to the end-expiratory point on the spirometry tracing used to calculate expiratory reserve volume and inspiratory capacity (needed for the computation of RV and TLC from the measured FRC); and it requires a long period of reequilibration with room air before the test can be repeated. Measuring spirometric volumes immediately before measuring FRC as a combined, continuous sequence can eliminate the assumption of a constant or reproducible end-expiratory volume. This can be achieved with appropriate valves connected to the mouthpiece, which are available in many commercial systems.",

Because the meter is sensitive to carbon dioxide, and because carbon dioxide must in any case be removed from a closed system, a carbon dioxide absorber is added. The removal of carbon dioxide results in a constant fall in the volume of gas in the closed circuit, as oxygen is consumed and the subject produces carbon dioxide. An equivalent amount of oxygen is therefore introduced as an initial bolus or as a continuous flow. In either case, it is important that the subject be \"switched into\" the system at the end-tidal point. It is possible to calculate the correction for an error in this point, but only if the subject is able to relax and exhale reproducibly to the actual end-tidal point while breathing from the circuit. In a cooperative subject the closed-circuit method also permits the measurement of inspiratory capacity, expiratory reserve volume, and VC from maneuvers recorded on the spirometer while the subject is switched into the system.

One involves measurement of the mean concentration of nitrogen in the air exhaled after the VC inspiration of pure oxygen in the single-breath nitrogen washout test of the distribution of ventilation. 42 The other involves measuring the change in concentration of the neon, helium, or methane used as the inert tracer gas in the single-breath measurement of the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DL CO ). 43 Indeed, the alveolar volume achieved during performance of the standard diffusing capacity maneuver is approximately TLC and must be calculated in order to measure DL CO . Although the lung volume calculated from the single-breath nitrogen washout test of distribution is reported rarely, the TLC calculated from measurement of DL CO is used commonly in many pulmonary function laboratories. Because the time for dilution of the tracer gas is short (10 seconds), true TLC is underestimated in patients with severe airway obstruction or uneven distribution of ventilation. FEV 1 /FVC must be less than 0.40 for TLC measured by single-breath dilution to be underestimated significantly. In healthy subjects and in patients with mild airflow obstruction, the values obtained correspond well with those obtained by body plethysmography. 6, 44 Radiographic Methods.

Volume changes associated with compression or expansion of gas within the thorax are measured as pressure changes in gas surrounding the subject within the box. Volume exchange between lung and box does not directly cause pressure changes, although thermal, humidity, and carbon dioxide-oxygen exchange differences between inspired and expired gas do cause pressure changes. Thoracic gas volume and airway resistance are measured during rapid maneuvers, so small leaks are tolerated or are introduced to vent slow thermal-pressure drift. This device is best suited for measuring small volume changes because of its high sensitivity and excellent frequency response. It need not be leak-free, absolutely rigid, or refrigerated because the measurements are usually brief and are used to study rapid events. THORACIC GAS VOLUME. The thoracic gas volume is the compressible gas in the thorax, whether or not it is in free communication with airways. By Boyle's law, pressure times the volume of the gas in the thorax is constant if its temperature remains constant (PV = P\u2032V\u2032). At endexpiration, alveolar pressure (Palv) equals atmospheric pressure (P) because there is no airflow; V (thoracic gas volume) is unknown (eFig. . Then, the airway is occluded and the subject makes small inspiratory and expiratory efforts against the occluded airway. During inspiratory efforts, the thorax enlarges (\u0394V) and decompresses intrathoracic gas, creating a new thoracic gas volume (V\u2032 = V + \u0394V) and a new pressure (P\u2032 = P + \u0394P). A pressure transducer between the subject's mouth and the occluded airway measures the new pressure (P\u2032). It is assumed that the mouth pressure (Pmouth) Figure 25 -12 A closed, constant-volume, variable-pressure wholebody plethysmograph. As described in eFigure 25-5, at end-expiration airflow is zero, thoracic gas volume (V) = functional residual capacity, and alveolar pressure (Palv) = mouth pressure (PM) = barometric pressure (Pbar). The rectangle represents the plethysmograph. When the subject inhales against an occluded shutter in the airway, airflow remains zero, but V increases by \u0394V to V\u2032 and PM (= Palv) increases by \u0394P (P + \u0394P) to equal P\u2032. When PM is plotted against box pressure (Pbox), the slope of the line (\u03b1) yields \u0394V/\u0394Palv, and V=\u0394V/\u0394Palv \u00d7 Pbar, as indicated in the text. V, airflow. has constant pressure and variable volume. When thoracic volume changes, gas is displaced through a hole in the box wall and is measured either with a spirometer or by integrating the flow through a pneumotachygraph (or flowmeter). This device is suitable for measuring small or large volume changes. To attain good frequency response, the impedance to gas displacement must be very small. This requires a low-resistance pneumotachygraph, a sensitive transducer, and a fast, driftfree integrator, or meticulous use of special spirometers; consequently this form of plethysmography is challenging and is used in the research setting only.",

The displacement volume, V \u222b , is added to the plethysmograph compression volume, PboxKbox, to produce the \"true\" volume. If the volume change were instantaneous, the \"true\" volume event would be as illustrated in eFigure 25-4A. During this rapid inspiration, pressure in the plethysmograph increases abruptly and then decays exponentially (see eFig. 25-4B). If the plethysmograph flowmeter has a linear response, the plethysmograph flow signal (see eFig. 25-4C) will have a shape similar to that of the pressure signal (see eFig. 25-4B). The plethysmograph flow signal is integrated to determine volume (see eFig. 25-4D). The integrated flow signal attains the same level as that of the \"true\" volume event, but the shape of the integrated flow signal does not conform to that of the \"true\" volume event. The difference between the two waveforms is due to compression of the large volume of gas in the plethysmograph and is directly proportional to plethysmograph pressure. Thus, by adding a portion of the plethysmograph pressure to the integrated plethysmograph flow, the \"true\" volume event may be reconstructed accurately (see eFig. 25-4E) using Equation 1. The relative contributions of these two variables vary with frequency, but when added together, they always yield the total \u0394V. RAW is measured during airflow and represents the ratio of the driving pressure (between the alveoli [Palv] and mouth [Pmouth] ) and instantaneous airflow ( V). In a closed plethysmograph, inspiration of 500 mL of gas from the box into the lungs increases plethysmographic pressure. At the start of inspiration, thoracic gas volume enlarges, and Palv (previously at atmospheric pressure) becomes subatmospheric throughout inspiration; thus alveolar gas occupies a larger volume. This decompression of thoracic gas is equivalent to adding a small volume of gas to the plethysmograph, so its pressure increases (as measured by a sensitive pressure transducer). The reverse results during exhalation, when alveolar gas is compressed. Thus V is measured continuously with a pneumotachygraph, Pmouth is measured with a pressure transducer connected to a side tap in the mouthpiece, and Palv is estimated continuously with the body plethysmograph ( Fig. 25-13 ).",

            "text": "GENERAL PRINCIPLES. Airway resistance (RAW) is easy to measure and is always related to the lung volume at which it is measured. It is useful to detect diseases such as asthma that are associated with increased airway smooth muscle tone. This can be accomplished by demonstrating that RAW is abnormally increased relative to lung volume, or by inducing significant relaxation of bronchomotor tone by administration of bronchodilator drugs. The test is very sensitive in detecting increased airway smooth muscle tone induced by provocative stimuli. This approach is useful in the assessment of nonspecific hyperirritability in response to pharmacologic agents, exercise, or cold air, or in response to specific agents such as allergens or chemicals (e.g., isocyanates) that are associated with occupational asthma (see \"Bronchial Provocation\" section). Measurements of RAW may also be useful in differential diagnosis of the type of airflow obstruction or localization of the major site of obstruction. The rectangle represents a closed, constant-volume, variable-pressure, whole-body plethysmograph, as in eFig. 25-5. The subject is represented by a single alveolus and its conducting airway. The top pressure transducer measures pressure within the plethysmograph, or box pressure (Pbox). The middle pressure transducer measures the pressure drop across the pneumotachygraph connected in series with the open shutter to the airway, which yields airflow ( V ). The bottom pressure transducer measures airway pressure (alveolar pressure during no flow, or Palv). During inspiration, the alveolus enlarges by \u0394V from the original volume (broken line) to a new volume (solid line); during expiration, the alveolus returns to its original volume. Throughout inspiration, alveolar gas (previously at atmospheric pressure) is subatmospheric and therefore occupies more volume. This is the same as adding this increment of gas volume resulting from decompression of the alveolar gas to the plethysmograph, so Pbox increases and is recorded by the sensitive Pbox transducer. The reverse happens during expiration when alveolar gas is compressed. Thus alveolar pressure can be monitored throughout the respiratory cycle. When V is plotted against Pbox, the slope of the line (\u03b2) yields the ratio of \u0394Pbox/ V as indicated in the text. In practice, RAW is determined by measuring the slope (\u03b2) of a curve of plethysmograph pressure (x-axis) displayed against airflow (y-axis) on a computer monitor during rapid, shallow breathing through a pneumotachygraph within the plethysmograph. Then, a shutter is closed across the mouthpiece, and the slope (\u03b1) of plethysmographic pressure (x-axis) displayed against Pmouth (y-axis) is measured during panting under static conditions. Because Pmouth equals Palv in a static system, the second step serves two purposes. First, it relates changes in plethysmographic pressure to changes in Palv in each subject. Palv is effectively measured during flow, provided that the ratio of lung to plethysmographic gas volume is constant, because Palv for a given plethysmographic pressure is the same whether or not flow is interrupted. Second, it relates RAW to a particular thoracic gas volume:",

Alternatively, both artifacts may be avoided if the subjects breathe quietly at body temperature (37\u00b0 C) and standard pressure fully saturated with water vapor (760 mm Hg) (BTPS) or may be compensated for electronically. 53 RAW measured plethysmographically is not the average of unequal resistances throughout the lungs; rather, it is the average Palv per unit volume divided by average airflow rate at the mouth. It corresponds to average airway conductance (GAW). GAW = G 1 + G 2 + \u2026 +G n , which is equivalent to adding resistances in parallel according to reciprocals: 1/RAW = (1/R 1 ) + (1/R 2 ) + \u2026 + (1/R n ).

Thus the test may not be practical for the routine evaluation of patients with restrictive ventilatory defects but may be of great value in the assessment of various obstructive ventilatory defects, including those with isolated bullae or advanced emphysema, to determine whether patients will benefit from resection of nonfunctioning or very poorly functioning lung tissue.

This relationship may be used to analyze the mechanism of airflow limitation in various obstructive ventilatory defects (e.g., bullous lung disease). 48, 49 AIRWAY SMOOTH MUSCLE TONE. The airways are affected markedly by smooth muscle tone, depending on the state of inflation and the subject's previous pattern of breathing (referred to as \"volume history\"). 50 These relationships are relevant to diseases in which smooth muscle tone is increased (e.g., asthma) or low lung volumes are encountered (e.g., during cough). Thus, bronchoconstriction is not demonstrable temporarily after a deep breath or at TLC in healthy subjects. Similarly, RAW in healthy subjects may be greater when a given lung volume is reached from RV than from TLC. PANTING. Panting minimizes changes in the plethysmograph caused by thermal, water saturation, and carbon dioxide-oxygen exchange differences during inspiration and expiration; hence these factors may be neglected if measurements are made during panting. Panting also improves the signal-to-drift ratio, because each respiratory cycle is completed in a fraction of a second; gradual thermal changes and small leaks in the box become insignificant compared with volume changes attributable to compression and decompression of alveolar gas.

Increasingly laboratories are using commercial plethysmographs that estimate RAW during so-called quiet breathing, relying on computer software rather than panting to compensate for the effects of humidity, temperature, and gas exchange. In fact, the subject must breathe at higher than normal frequencies and tidal volumes to estimate RAW using this software. The limitation to this approach is that the average resistance values tend to be slightly higher than those observed during Impulse Oscillometry and Forced Oscillation Methods to Measure Respiratory Resistance (Rather Than Airway Resistance). 54, 55 DuBois and colleagues 52 described an oscillatory method to measure the mechanical properties of the lung and thorax. In contrast to the methods already described, the oscillation techniques use an external loudspeaker or similar device to generate and impose flow oscillations on spontaneous breathing, rather than using the respiratory muscles. Impulse oscillometry measures RAW and lung compliance independently of respiratory muscle strength and patient cooperation. Sound waves at various frequencies (3 to 20 Hz) are applied to the entire respiratory system (airways, lung tissue, and chest wall); a piston pump can be used to apply such pressure waves around the body in a whole-body respirator. With modern computer methods, the slow frequency changes in pressure, flow, and volume generated by the respiratory muscles during normal breathing are subtracted from the raw data, permitting analysis of the pressure-flow-volume relationships imposed by the oscillation device (eFig. .",

This approach has been used extensively in Europe because it is fast, noninvasive, and reproducible; moreover, it seems to yield clinically meaningful results in healthy subjects before and after use of a bronchodilator, as well as in the evaluation of airflow obstruction in COPD, asthma, and congestive heart failure. [59] [60] [61] It should be noted that the lungs and chest wall rarely respond to a driving pressure with diverse frequencies in the same way as a simple model assumed to be composed of single values of resistance, compliance, and inertance, as described earlier. The resonant frequency of the ribs is 7 to 10 Hz, whereas the resonant frequency of the abdomen and diaphragm is about 3 Hz. The air in the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles has an inertial reactance that is significant at relatively high frequencies (\u22486 Hz or greater). Consequently, when the whole system appears to be at resonant frequency, the impedance is probably not a pure resistance at all, but rather an admixture of other forces of the lungs and chest wall, as described earlier. [62] [63] [64] [65] Bijaoui and colleagues 66 have taken advantage of the impact of cardiogenic oscillations on the adjacent lungs to estimate mechanical output impedance of the lung. They observed that the beating heart creates small oscillations in flow that can be measured at the mouth when the glottis is open. Using the Fourier-domain ratio of these oscillations in pressure and flow, Bijaoui and coworkers calculated the respiratory impedance to be between 1.5 and 10 Hz. The real portion was similar to or smaller than the resistance measured simultaneously by the forced oscillation method. They suggested that they are measuring the flow resistance of the central and upper airway. This approach may prove to be useful to obtain information about the mechanical properties of the lungs without the need for an external source of applied flow. static lung elastic recoil pressure is plotted against lung volume expressed as a percentage of predicted TLC. 70 Such a plot often makes it obvious whether a reduction in TLC is a function of the inability to generate an adequate lung elastic recoil pressure due to neural, muscular, or chest wall disease or is caused by a true loss of lung compliance. If lung compliance is reduced, it can still be difficult to determine whether the abnormality is due to a true increase in elastic forces or to a decrease in the number of alveoli communicating with the airways (see later discussion).",

However, it is clear that lung compliance changes with lung volume, with the highest values observed at volumes around FRC and lower values prevailing as the lungs are expanded more nearly to TLC (Fig. 25-14) . Compliance therefore is usually reported as the slope of the curve at the point 0.5 L above FRC. However, when this convention is used, the value expressed for lung compliance is influenced by the determinants of FRC, rather than simply by the relationship between lung volume and distending pressure. Another value commonly calculated is the coefficient of retraction (lung elastic recoil pressure at TLC divided by TLC). Normal values are available for both compliance and the coefficient of retraction, although the great variability of these measurements limits their utility in individual patients. Because lung compliance is so dependent on lung volume (compliance can fall by 50% with resection of one lung, for example, even though the elastic properties of the remaining lung are unaltered), its variability can be somewhat reduced by correcting it for height, predicted TLC, or measured FRC. 69 Maximum information about lung elastic recoil can be derived by analyzing the whole curve, when, for example, To preserve the patency of a tube placed in the esophagus to measure esophageal pressure, it is necessary to cover the end of the tube with a balloon. This complicates the situation, for now intraballoon pressure is assumed to reflect intraesophageal pressure, which in turn is assumed to reflect the surrounding Ppl. The artifacts caused by the balloon generally cause the measured pressure to be too positive, owing to the compression of the balloon by the walls of the esophagus (eFig. . A long (10 cm), narrow (2.5-cm perimeter), thin-walled (0.04 cm), highly compliant latex balloon containing a small amount (0.2 to 0.4 mL) of air can reduce these artifacts. The volume of air that minimizes this artifact varies slightly for different balloons. The volume can be determined for each balloon by suspending it vertically in water, with the top (proximal end) of the balloon at the surface, allowing it to empty before the tube is closed with a stopcock. 67 Ppl changes along a vertical gradient, with pressures being most negative at the base of the thoracic space. It is customary to measure pressure in the lower third of the esophagus, to estimate the pressure necessary to expand the greater proportion of the lungs. The balloon is advanced to the gastroesophageal junction (identified easily by the positive pressure caused by an inspiratory sniff) and then pulled back 10 cm.",

From published data in normal lungs and in patients with emphysema, they calculated specific lung elastance (change in lung elastic recoil pressure to produce a given fractional change in lung volume) for normal and emphysematous lungs. They found that specific lung elastance and the change in specific elastance with lung elastic recoil were increased in patients with emphysema compared with normal subjects. They speculated that this finding probably represents two distinct abnormalities in the elastic properties of emphysematous lungs: (1) an increase in resting length of alveolar walls, accounting for hyperinflation (TLC); and (2) a decrease in extensibility of alveolar walls once they become stressed (specific lung elastance). Surprisingly, these studies found no correlation between either of these factors and FEV 1 . They concluded that the change in elastic properties of the lungs in emphysema does not appear to account for flow limitation in this disease. Furthermore, because of the decreased extensibility of emphysematous lungs, they also suggested that these emphysematous regions are not only poorly perfused but also poorly ventilated; therefore they speculated that emphysema per se may not seriously disturb ventilationperfusion relationships. 70f An equally surprising study of patients with severe expiratory airflow obstruction was reported by Gelb and colleagues. 70g They documented that marked loss of lung elastic recoil, causing hyperinflation with increased TLC, associated with decreased DL CO , can be present despite the absence of or only trivial emphysema on lung CT scans and in morphologic studies. These authors attributed the decreased DL CO to errors related to inhomogeneity of ventilation and increased physiologic dead space. They attributed the severe, fixed expiratory airflow limitation to intrinsic disease of the bronchioles. They speculated that bronchiolar obstruction caused dynamic hyperinflation and gas trapping, leading to chronic loss of lung elastic recoil through unknown mechanisms, despite the absence of macroscopic emphysema. Thus the combination of increased TLC plus spuriously reduced DL CO may be mistaken for emphysema; in such cases high-resolution lung CT scanning may help to clarify the source of lung hyperinflation as resulting from bronchiolar disease.",

[72] [73] [74] In 2010 the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis lung study assessed the performance of the NHANES III reference equations in 3893 participants, of which approximately one third were Asian Americans. This study found the equations to be valid for the previously mentioned ethnic groups and, in addition, the investigators suggested that a correction factor of 0.88 be applied to the predicted and lower limits of normal values when comparing whites and Asian Americans. 75 The ATS statement also emphasizes the importance of laboratory control of technical sources of variation, including strict adherence to ATS guidelines for equipment performance and calibration, minimizing temperature-related errors, careful validation of computer calculations when purchasing or changing equipment or software, and proper performance of the tests. Although certain withinindividual sources of variation fall within the control of each laboratory, between-individual sources of variation are critical to the choice of appropriate reference values. Furthermore, environmental sources of variation pertinent to a given patient (in addition to other relevant clinical data) are likely to be known by the referring clinician.

Furthermore, distributions of flow rates and ratios (FEV 1 /FVC) are not symmetrical. 28 Therefore publications describing reference populations should include not only the prediction equations but also a means to define their lower limits. A lower limit can be estimated from a regression model. For spirometry, values below the 5th percentile are taken as below the \"lower limit of normal.\" 28 If there are sufficient measurements within each category, percentiles can be estimated directly from the data.

Several investigators have analyzed this problem and have provided predicted mean values and estimates of the lower limit of normal values. 6, 28 This wide range of normal values limits the interpretation of spirometric and flow-volume curves. 81 If a subject has values in the very low normal range at a given time, the results may be normal for that person or may be significantly abnormal in a person whose VC or flow rates were much higher than average before the onset of the disease. In such cases a discrepancy between static and dynamic measurements, expressed as a percentage of predicted value, may yield a clue to this situation. For example, it would be unusual for a normal person to have a VC that is 115% of the predicted value and a FEF 25%-75% that is 85% of the predicted normal value.

Thus some regions of lung fill and empty more slowly than others, resulting in abnormal single-breath nitrogen test results. Why, then, is a test of distribution indicated in clinical evaluations? First, in mild disease, spirometry and clinical evidence may be equivocal, but tests of distribution may provide a more sensitive indicator of the presence of disease and the response to treatment. Second, not only is the test sensitive, but the degree of abnormality of the single-breath may be necessary to document this phenomenon and to rule out a mixed restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect.

            "text": "A restrictive ventilatory defect is suggested by a decreased VC, reflecting limitation in chest excursion (which, according to the ATS expert panel, requires confirmation by a decreased TLC). Typical results consist of a decreased VC, little or no reduction in expiratory airflow, and relative preservation of MVV. Early in the development of an interstitial lung disease, before development of decreased lung volumes, volume-corrected flow (i.e., flow divided by the total lung capacity, to account for lung size) and FEV 1 /FVC ratios are increased. These increased airflow rates result from the increased force causing outward traction on airway walls. Thus airway diameters become larger than normal relative to lung volume, so airflow rates are increased. Because of the increased flows relative to lung volume, the usual flowvolume curve in restrictive defects is tall and narrow (see Fig. 25-15 ). With time, as the disease becomes more severe, lung volumes decrease, as reflected by a decreased VC. If the disease can be reversed, volumes return to normal first, then volume-corrected flows, and then the FEV 1 /FVC ratio. [98] [99] [100] ",

Thus they are useful for detecting the presence of abnormal function early, when other test results are normal, or to confirm the presence of airflow obstruction when other test results are only mildly abnormal. They are particularly important in the evaluation of patients the assumption that TLC does not change during exercise and hence that changes in inspiratory capacity reflect changes in end-expiratory lung volume. Most reports indicate that TLC does not change with exercise, 86 ,87 but others have found that TLC does increase. 88 In addition, this approach assumes that the patients can make a truly maximal inspiratory effort during exercise. In fact, some COPD patients are not able to perform these maneuvers during exercise. 2. Maximal expiratory airflow depends on the volume and time history of the preceding inspiration. 89, 90 However, the previous volume and time history always differ between tidal breathing and maximal inspiration. Therefore assessment of flow limitation by comparison of tidal and maximal flow-volume curves may lead to erroneous assumption of abnormal airway collapsibility, even if the measurements are made plethysmographically. 3. In nearly all reports, the tidal and forced flow-volume loops were obtained from measurements of expired gas volume at the mouth. The assumption is made that both loops develop at the same lung volume when, in fact, the forced loop may be at a smaller volume due to gas compression during the forced maneuver. Such gas compression artifacts can be avoided by measuring volume with a body plethysmograph, as suggested by Ingram and Schilder. 91 ",

An alternative approach, called the negative expiratory pressure method, has been developed by Koulouris and associates 93 (eFig. . This method does not require flow-volume maneuvers by the subject, nor must it be performed in a body plethysmograph. A negative pressure is applied at the mouth during a tidal expiration, and the ensuing expiratory flow-volume curve is compared with that of the previous control tidal expiration. With this method the volume and time history of the control and test breath are the same. The negative expiratory pressure method has been validated in mechanically ventilated patients by direct comparison with isovolume pressure-flow curves. 94 It has also been used to study stable COPD patients at rest and during exercise. 95, 96 Ninane and associates 97 have offered another approach to the technical issues associated with comparing tidal breathing with maximal flow curves. They described a method to detect expiratory flow limitation by manual compression of the abdominal wall. In healthy subjects, abdominal compression causes decreased abdominal diameter, increased gastric and pleural pressures, and increased expiratory flow. This method has been used successfully to study expiratory flow limitation in neonates, but in adults with COPD abdominal compression fails to increase expiratory flow despite increased gastric and pleural pressures. 97 Protocol. The single-breath nitrogen washout test (sometimes called the single-breath oxygen test) is designed to assess the uniformity of gas distribution in the lungs and the behavior of the dependent airways. 101 At present the most clinically useful aspect of the test is the measurement of the slope of phase III (alveolar gas plateau) to determine the uniformity of gas distribution. The subject inspires a single breath of pure oxygen from RV to TLC (inspiratory VC maneuver); nitrogen concentration at the mouth during exhalation is measured with a nitrogen analyzer or mass spectrometer. At end-inspiration, the dead space is filled with oxygen that has just been inspired (see eFig. . At the beginning of the subsequent expiratory VC maneuver, the nitrogen meter continues to record 0% nitrogen, because the first gas to leave the lungs is from conducting airways-the so-called anatomic dead space (phase I) (see eFig. . Subsequently, the nitrogen concentration increases in a sigmoid curve upward and reflects mixing of gas from dead space and alveoli (phase II). The slightly sloping plateau in phase III reflects the almost constant nitrogen concentration in alveolar gas. If inspired oxygen is distributed evenly to all alveoli so each has the same nitrogen concentration, then phase III of the nitrogen tracing is almost horizontal (alveolar plateau). However, if inspired oxygen is distributed unevenly (as happens to a small extent even in healthy subjects), then the end-inspiratory nitrogen concentrations are not equal throughout the lung. The concentrations of exhaled nitrogen from different alveoli are not recorded as a horizontal line; the first portion of phase III usually contains a lower nitrogen concentration than the last portion.",

This variability appears to be due to differences between individual lungs; when a subject generates such a curve, usually all curves produced by that subject are difficult to analyze. On the other hand, if a subject generates a curve that is easy to analyze, most curves produced by that subject are reproducible. Obviously, analysis of these curves requires good judgment; some curves, although conforming to the criteria of acceptability, are unreadable and therefore should be ignored. It appears difficult, if not impossible, at present to establish a uniform set of criteria for this analysis. 102 Normal Values. The slope of phase III (percentage of nitrogen per liter) is determined as the line of best fit (by least-squares linear regression) between 70% of VC and the onset of phase IV.

In the multiple-breath nitrogen washout, for example, continuous breath-by-breath measurement of nitrogen concentration at the mouth during tidal breathing of pure oxygen is performed until end-tidal nitrogen concentration falls to less than 1%. The fall in endtidal nitrogen concentration on a breath-by-breath basis is related to the cumulative volume of ventilation or breath number. By extending the nitrogen washout time to 30 minutes or more in subjects with severe chronic airway obstruction, estimates of lung volume may be obtained that compare favorably with those calculated by plethysmographic or radiographic methods. 107 Exponential analysis of the end-tidal nitrogen concentration with time, cumulative ventilation, or breath number reveals that in normal subjects nitrogen concentration decreases in a single exponential curve. In the presence of uneven distribution of ventilation, the curve can be described by two or more exponentials. This analysis can be extended to estimate the size of poorly ventilated regions of the lung, but these multiple-breath tests are cumbersome and time-consuming, may have no anatomic correlates, and cannot be repeated rapidly (i.e., until all the added oxygen is washed out).",

Molecules of carbon monoxide diffuse across the membrane, dissolve in the plasma, and then combine with hemoglobin. Carbon monoxide has a high affinity for hemoglobin, 210 times that of oxygen; thus carbon monoxide in the vicinity of a hemoglobin molecule binds avidly to it, and the partial pressure of dissolved carbon monoxide remains very low. Except in a patient with severe anemia, the available binding sites for carbon monoxide are so numerous that they cannot be saturated by the number of carbon monoxide molecules that diffuse from the air spaces to the capillary blood at the low concentrations of carbon monoxide used in the test. Therefore carbon monoxide transfer is not limited by pulmonary blood flow; instead, it is limited primarily by the alveolar-capillary diffusion rate and, to a lesser extent, by the red blood cell membrane diffusion rate and the chemical reaction rate between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide transfer therefore can be considered a measure of the capillary surface area available for gas exchange.",

Many pulmonary diseases are manifested by a diffusion defect when there is no abnormality apparent in other routine pulmonary function tests. These diseases include all interstitial lung diseases, asbestosis, scleroderma, lupus erythematosus, emphysema, pulmonary thromboembolism, diffuse metastatic cancer of the lungs, 112 Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and rejection of a transplanted lung. There is now considerable evidence correlating the diffusing capacity and its subdivisions (membrane diffusing capacity [DM] and pulmonary capillary blood volume [VC]) with the morphometric study of normal lungs. 113 Similar correlative studies of the lungs of patients with emphysema 48 document the structural basis for the abnormal alveolar-capillary interface as a result of decreased numbers of patent pulmonary capillary segments. 114 Finally, the tests are relatively simple (as far as the patient is concerned) and easy to repeat, making it practical to study the diffusing capacity frequently and to evaluate the effects of therapy or the natural history of the disease.",

            "text": "Diffusing Capacity STEADY-STATE METHOD. In the steady-state method, the patient breathes a mixture of 0.1% carbon monoxide in air for several minutes through a one-way valve system. During the last 2 minutes, exhaled gas is collected in a plastic bag and analyzed for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide concentrations (requiring rapidly responding gas analyzers). During collection, an arterial blood sample is drawn and analyzed for PCO 2 . 121 The amount of carbon monoxide transferred from the air spaces to capillary blood per minute ( VCO) can be calculated from the inspired and expired gas concentrations and the volume of gas exhaled ( VE) at standard conditions (i.e., STPD, where the \"ideal gas\" is corrected to standard pressure dry [760 \u2212 47 mm Hg] and 0\u00b0 C or 273\u00b0 K, where 1 mole of ideal gas occupies 22.4 L. Steady-state DL CO can be measured during tidal breathing, anesthesia, sleep, and exercise. Nevertheless, the method is not used widely because its results are more subject to error than those of the single-breath technique, especially in patients with uneven distribution of ventilation or with ventilation-perfusion abnormalities. In these conditions, a decreased DL CO (steady state) may reflect impairment of the ventilation-perfusion ratio V /Q A C, where VA is alveolar ventilation and QC is pulmonary capillary blood flow, or an alteration of pulmonary gas transfer. A major problem is the estimation of alveolar carbon monoxide concentration. In addition, the method requires obtaining an arterial blood sample and is extremely sensitive to changes in breathing pattern. The \"end-tidal\" modification 112 of the steady-state method does not require arterial blood samples but suffers from even more sources of error. Both approaches to the estimation of diffusing capacity really reflect ventilationperfusion abnormalities in the lungs more than characteristics of the alveolar-capillary surface and functioning pulmonary capillaries. Marshall 122 has reported another modification of this method, in which mixed venous PCO 2 was computed by an equilibration method that avoids arterial puncture but may be too imprecise for use in the Filley equations (Equations 21 and 22) at rest. REBREATHING METHOD. In the rebreathing method, 123 the patient rebreathes the test gas (air plus a low concentration of carbon monoxide) from a reservoir, the volume of which equals the patient's FEV 1 . The patient exhales to RV before a valve is turned, then rebreathes from the reservoir, which should be emptied with each inspiration. Rebreathing continues for 30 to 45 seconds at a controlled rate of 30 breaths/min (to ensure mixing between lung and reservoir). The volume of RV plus reservoir, multiplied by the change in carbon monoxide concentration, equals the carbon monoxide volume transferred. Mean capillary PCO is neglected. Mean alveolar PCO is calculated from the same equation used in the single-breath method. The rebreathing method for measuring DL CO is more variable and requires considerable patient cooperation, but it is less influenced by abnormalities in distribution of ventilation and is easier to use during exercise than the steady-state or single-breath technique. The rapid respiratory rate may be difficult for some patients to maintain and is not physiologic. THREE-GAS ITERATION METHOD. Graham and associates 124 have described a method of calculating DL CO that uses separate equations for the inhalation, breath-hold, and exhalation phases of the single-breath maneuver rather than trying to force them to fit the breath-hold equation. The method is now available commercially using a rapidly responding infrared analyzer. This method has been reported in a theoretical paper, 125 analyzed in a lung model, and compared with the standard Ogilvie method, 119 the Jones-Mead modification, 120 and the ATS epidemiology standardization modification of the Ogilvie method. 23 It has also been reported during exercise. [116] [117] [118] Although DL CO values calculated using the three conventional methods showed large changes with variations in inspiratory flow rates, inspiratory volumes, and collection times, the three-equation method yielded calculations of DL CO that were minimally affected by these changes. 124 These results agree with previous results obtained in the lung model, support the hypothesis that diffusing capacity is independent of lung volume, and indicate that the threegas iteration method significantly improves the accuracy and precision of single-breath measurements. 126",

As originally described, the subject performs two VC maneuvers, then exhales to RV and rapidly inhales a mixture containing 0.3% carbon monoxide, 15% helium, 21% oxygen, and the remainder nitrogen from a bag-inbox. After a 3-second breath-hold, the subject exhales while watching a flow signal to maintain a constant flow of 0.5 L/ sec. Carbon monoxide concentrations are measured continuously with a rapidly responding infrared meter, and helium concentrations are measured with a mass spectrometer. Airflow is measured with a pneumotachygraph and integrated electrically to obtain volume. Data are converted from analog to digital form at 30 points per second and recorded by a digital computer to adjust carbon monoxide and helium recordings for time lags and to remove cardiac oscillations using a sliding, 30-point curve-averaging technique. The exhaled VC is divided into 2% decrements, and the corresponding exhaled carbon monoxide and helium values are used for calculations. The initial part of the VC, until the onset of phase III of the helium curve, is discarded as dead space. The lower portion of the VC, after the onset of phase IV of the helium curve, is also discarded because of uncertainties regarding contributions by dependent regions to expired gas concentrations. Approximately 40 data points are obtained over the lower 80% of the exhaled VC, and the rate of carbon monoxide uptake is calculated over 10% intervals of the exhaled VC (e.g., 20% to 421.e2 30%, 22% to 32%). Alveolar volume is calculated at the midpoint of each 10% interval by subtracting the exhaled volume from TLC (measured by the single-breath helium dilution method). Intrabreath DL CO is calculated in each interval by the Krogh equation 129 and plotted against exhaled volume. latter in being independent of Po 2 and the hematocrit. It has been suggested that DL NO can be used to describe pulmonary DM directly. 151a",

A normal single-breath diffusing capacity in the setting of an obstructive pattern argues against the presence of emphysema. 48 In fact, a normal or increased single-breath DL CO associated with airflow obstruction is often associated with asthma. 160 The single-breath DL CO may be abnormal in patients with emphysema when there is no evidence of airflow obstruction, and it may become progressively more abnormal much more rapidly than tests of airway function, even when they do become abnormal. 161 Several studies have demonstrated a correlation not only with the presence of emphysema but also with the amount of emphysema. 134, [162] [163] [164] [165] DL CO has also been used to study the earliest stages of emphysema. For example, some studies suggest that alveolar septal destruction may be seen in cigarette smokers before the development of either increased air space size or anatomic evidence of emphysema. 166 In our laboratory, single-breath DL CO was found to correlate with emphysema grade by panel grading 167 from grade 1 to 100 (r = \u22120.73) in 50 patients whose lungs were studied at surgical resection, which was performed within 1 week of their pulmonary function tests (eFig. .

Exercise raises DL CO and DL O2 by enlarging the surface area of functioning alveoli in contact with pulmonary capillaries (eFig. . This is due primarily to recruitment of capillaries. Exercise causes an approximate doubling of pulmonary diffusing capacity and pulmonary capillary blood volume. 142, 143 Huang and coworkers 109 studied 105 healthy subjects with the intrabreath method and reported reference equations for diffusing capacity at rest and during exercise based on age, sex, and height. Hsia and associates 143 found that DL CO increased normally as cardiac output increased during exercise in patients who had undergone pneumonectomy compared with normal subjects. Although an upper limit to DL CO with respect to oxygen uptake during exercise was observed by Stokes and colleagues, 144 using the intrabreath carbon monoxide method, our group and Hsia et al found no upper limit to DL CO in normal subjects or in pneumonectomy patients with respect to cardiac output during exercise. 116, 145 Maximal values attained during exercise in patients who had undergone pneumonectomy were less than those attained by normal controls, as might be expected because the patients had been chronic smokers and probably had emphysema in the remaining lung.",

Kinker and associates 147 used a modified steady-state method to determine breath-bybreath DL CO during exercise. They found that the rise of DL CO with increasing work was attenuated at high levels of exercise (maximal oxygen uptake, or VO max 2 , approximately 4 L/min) in most subjects, suggesting that alveolarcapillary surface area tends to approach a maximum. 147 These findings are consistent with studies of capillary perfusion patterns in single alveolar walls visualized through a transparent thoracic window implanted in anesthetized dogs. 148 Results of this study agreed with a computer model of capillary flow developed by West and associates. 149 BODY POSITION. DL CO is 15% to 20% greater in the supine than in the sitting position and 10% to 15% greater in the sitting than in the standing position, because of the effects of changes in posture on pulmonary capillary blood volume. ALVEOLAR OXYGEN PRESSURE. Alveolar PO 2 affects DL CO because of the former's effect on the carbon monoxide reaction with hemoglobin. For example, diffusing capacity values measured at alveolar PO 2 values of 40 and 600 mm Hg are approximately 45 and 18 mL/min per mm Hg, respectively (see Fig. 25-11) . Changes in DL CO caused by variations in alveolar PO 2 in the physiologic range are much smaller. In patients with severe hypoxia (arterial PO 2 < 40 mm Hg), increased pulmonary blood flow and dilation of the pulmonary capillaries may increase the DL CO . Hypoxia may also increase DL CO as a result of its effect on the reaction rate between carbon monoxide and hemoglobin.",

DL CO would be decreased by pulmonary vascular obstruction alone; however, DL CO would be normal if the obstruction led to an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure that then distended apical capillaries that were not perfused previously.

This possibility can be assessed by measuring the level of ventilation when the patient breathes room air and again with oxygen. Whereas normal subjects show a small decrease in ventilation, some example, may present with a TLC 50% of predicted normal, associated with a DL CO that is also 50% of predicted normal, in which case the D /V L A CO ratio is normal. Following treatment with systemic corticosteroids, the lung volume may return to normal, but diffusion may not, in which case the DL CO and D /V L A CO ratio may both be 50% of the predicted normal. In such cases, it is thought that the granulomas and fibrosis cause lasting damage to the alveolar membranes and capillaries, even though the lung volumes return to normal levels. Therefore clinical interpretation of the DL CO corrected for alveolar volume in patients with interstitial lung diseases is limited. It should not be assumed that a normal D /V L A CO ratio indicates that the capillary beds are functioning normally.",

DL CO is reported to be decreased abnormally in most patients with single-lung, double-lung, or heart and lung transplants. Great emphasis has been placed on the importance of detection of bronchiolitis obliterans in these patients as a potentially reversible manifestation of rejection that is lethal if treated inadequately or too late. 177 Given the frequency of diffusion defects in patients with lung transplants, and given that rejection is mediated via the vascular bed, it is surprising that little emphasis has been placed on the potential value of serial evaluation of DL CO to detect rejection early. 178, 179 A major limitation to the use of simple lung function monitoring in single-lung transplant patients is the bias caused by the contribution of the native lung. Ikonen and associates used relative ventilation, perfusion, and ventilation-perfusion ratio of the transplanted lung, as determined with multidetector xenon-133 ( 133 Xe) radiospirometry, to assess function of the graft specifically. Fractions of FEV 1 , FVC, and single-breath DL CO were also determined using corresponding radiospirometric parameters to calculate their distribution between the lungs. This approach may have potential for distinguishing between acute rejection and infection. 178",

The evidence of airway obstruction may be associated with uneven distribution of ventilation, as reflected by an abnormal single-breath nitrogen washout test, and associated hyperinflation, as reflected by increased RV and FRC. If the airway obstruction is severe (FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 0.4), the TLC measured by single-breath dilution may be underestimated significantly. 43, 44 In restrictive ventilatory defects, if airway function is normal, screening pulmonary function tests permit an early diagnosis by the finding of an increased FEV 1 /FVC ratio associated with increased maximal expiratory airflow. With more advanced disease, TLC, VC, and associated lung volumes are decreased, with evidence of uneven distribution of ventilation. In mixed ventilatory defects, the interpretation of the spirogram may be aided by examining FEV 1 as a percentage of predicted normal rather than as a percentage of FVC; however, mixed defects are more easily defined by measurement of TLC using a multiple-breath dilution technique or, preferably, body plethysmography. patients with chronic carbon dioxide retention show a marked decrease in ventilation.

This includes anatomic dead space and alveolar dead-space ventilation. The latter includes ventilation of alveoli without perfusion; alveoli with decreased perfusion and increased, normal, or slightly decreased ventilation; and alveoli with normal perfusion and marked overventilation. Because it is technically impossible to distinguish the various types of increased V /Q A C ratios, we assume that part of alveolar ventilation to regions with diminished perfusion goes to regions without any blood flow. That is, the physiologist assumes two compartments: one with and one without perfusion. Overventilation relative to perfusion wastes ventilation with respect to oxygen transfer because of the shape of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. Little oxygen is added to blood by increasing alveolar PO 2 from 100 to 140 mm Hg. This excess ventilation is not wasted with respect to carbon dioxide elimination, because increased ventilation decreases arterial carbon dioxide. Regions with excess ventilation are usually accompanied by other regions with diminished ventilation and increased PCO 2 . Ventilation is still \"wasted\" with respect to carbon dioxide, because it is not distributed proportionately to perfusion.

Under these circumstances the bolus is distributed in a pattern reflecting the early phase of inspiration starting at end-expiration. Because ventilation tends to be sequential, it is preferable to label the whole tidal breath. A bolus given at the beginning of inspiration after a maximal exhalation to RV is distributed preferentially to the lung apex. An inspiratory capacity breath of 133 Xe reflects regional compliance, not regional ventilation, and measures the regional inspiratory capacity. Thus it is possible to use the gas dilution principle to calculate regional inspiratory capacity or regional VC using a variety of radioisotopes. 202 The most widely used radioisotope study of the lung is the perfusion scan following intravenous injection of human serum albumin microspheres or microaggregates labeled with technetium-99m ( 99m Tc). 203 Particles are 20 to 50 \u00b5m in diameter and impact in small pulmonary vessels in proportion to local perfusion. Regional perfusion is measured, not perfusion per unit volume, so the volume of lung in the counting field influences the measurement. Calculations suggest that from 1 mg of protein, particles of 500, 100, and 30 \u00b5m in diameter obstruct, respectively, 0.12%, 0.31%, and 0.26% of the vascular bed. 204 On this basis, injection is potentially hazardous in patients with severe pulmonary vascular disease, and deaths in this situation have been recorded. However, with reasonable precautions, the risk is minimal. Passage of particles into the systemic circulation through right-to-left intrapulmonary or intracardiac shunts does not appear to be accompanied by side effects. The radiation dose from most pulmonary isotopic procedures is low and confined primarily to the lungs. A typical 133 Xe or 99m Tc study yields 0.2 to 0.4 rad (the annual permitted dose is 5 rad).",

Distribution of ventilation-perfusion ratios is evaluated with six inert gases of varying solubility dissolved in saline and infused intravenously and concurrently at a constant rate. Under these circumstances in the steady state, the amount of any gas exchanging between alveoli and pulmonary capillary blood is identical to that exchanging between alveoli and atmosphere. For each compartment, the quantity of gas is a function of the ventilation-perfusion ratio and the bloodgas partition coefficient for the gas in question, expressed as a fraction of that in the mixed venous blood. For the lung as a whole, the mixed arterial concentration is a blood flow-weighted mean of the values for several compartments, and the mean expired level is similarly a ventilationweighted mean of the compartmental values. These parameters are measured directly, together with the cardiac output and the minute volume of ventilation. They are used to calculate the corresponding mixed venous and alveolar concentrations and then a distribution of ventilation-perfusion ratios that is compatible with the arterial and alveolar concentrations of all gases concurrently (eFigs. 25-17 and 25-18) .",

Even preliminary deviations from this range can be interpreted only by also examining the PCO 2 , making use of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, to infer whether the deviation in pH is due primarily to a metabolic or a respiratory cause and whether it is due to an acute or chronic disturbance. In clinical use the pH meter has proved to be a rugged, dependable device. Repeated measurements of a single sample by the same instrument fall within a narrow range of \u00b10.02 unit (\u00b12 SD). Generally there is good agreement among the values obtained on unknown samples by the different instruments used by laboratories enrolled in quality-control programs (SD = 0.014 pH unit has been obtained in more than 800 laboratories). 207 This remarkable accuracy depends on the integrity of the differential permeability of the glass membrane to hydrogen ions. The permeability may be altered by the deposition of protein or by the development of cracks on the membrane surface. Proper quality control requires that pH calibration be checked at one point before each series of pH determinations and at two major points every 4 hours. A number of standard phosphate buffer solutions are suitable for routine calibrations and are available commercially. Protein contamination of the membrane can be minimized by flushing the electrode with a cleaning solution at regular intervals (every 10 samples) and by taking care to follow injections of blood with injections of saline (not distilled water).",

A correction factor is sometimes introduced into the calculation of arterial PO 2 when gases are used for calibration.

The measurement or estimation of oxygen content of arterial and venous blood is required for calculating cardiac output by the Fick equation and for estimating the \"shuntlike effect\" in hypoxemic patients. The chemical method for measuring total oxygen content involves liberating chemically bound oxygen and carbon dioxide from blood by adding ferricyanide, measuring the total quantity of gas displaced, and then absorbing the carbon dioxide with sodium hydroxide. This is the basis of the Van Slyke method, which served as the reference method for many years but is now used infrequently because of its demands on time and technical skill. 208 Another method is the galvanic cell method, in which oxygen is chemically liberated from blood and transferred to a fuel cell, where a current is generated in proportion to the amount of oxygen delivered. This device yields values with an accuracy and precision similar to those obtained by the Van Slyke method. 214 The method used most commonly for calculating oxygen content is measurement of the total hemoglobin concentration by the cyanmethemoglobin method, 215 the percentage of oxyhemoglobin by a spectrophotometric method, and the dissolved oxygen as the product of arterial PO 2 and oxygen's solubility coefficient (0.003 mL per 100 mL blood).",

In the absence of other materials that absorb light at the same wavelength, the concentration of a substance in a solution is proportional to the amount of light absorbed. This method is especially applicable to hemoglobin analysis, because the various forms of hemoglobin (e.g., oxyhemoglobin, reduced hemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, sulfhemoglobin, methemoglobin) have characteristic spectra of light absorption. A simple two-wavelength spectrophotometer developed in 1900 could relate the amount of oxyhemoglobin to total hemoglobin but gave falsely high values when carboxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin was present. Three-wavelength instruments can simultaneously measure total hemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, and carboxyhemoglobin; and a four-wavelength device is now marketed that enables measurement of methemoglobin as well. 215 The importance of measuring carboxyhemoglobin lies not just in quantifying correctly the proportion of nonreduced hemoglobin that is actually available for carrying oxygen but also in identifying a cause of a shift in the position of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. The presence of carboxyhemoglobin increases the affinity of adjacent hemoglobin molecules for oxygen, so the curve is shifted to the left (i.e., less oxygen is unloaded from oxyhemoglobin at normal tissue PO 2 ). Similar disorders may result from inherited abnormalities in hemoglobin structure, as with hemoglobin Chesapeake, for which 50% desaturation does not develop until the PO 2 is lowered to 19 mm Hg, as opposed to the normal 50% unloading point of 27 mm Hg.",

Alternatively, a close estimate of PO 2 can be drawn from single measurements of PO 2 and hemoglobin saturation. 215 Measurement of P 50 is rarely needed in clinical practice. With the important exception of conditions in which carboxyhemoglobin is likely to be present in appreciable quantities (as in victims of fires or of exposure to closed-space combustion, or in heavy cigarette and cigar smokers), the estimation of blood oxygen content from measurements of arterial PO 2 and hemoglobin concentration usually provides sufficient information for decisions about clinical management.",

However, in elderly patients and in patients with arteriosclerotic vascular disease, the adequacy of ulnar flow should be confirmed by the Allen test (appearance of palmar flush when the radial artery alone is decompressed). In infants, samples are most safely collected from the temporal or umbilical arteries. If radial and femoral arterial cannulation cannot be accomplished, then the brachial, axillary, and dorsalis pedis arteries should be considered. Sometimes physicians have been advised to avoid percutaneous cannulation of the brachial artery because of a lack of collateral vessels and the anatomic proximity to the median nerve. Aneurysm formation, thrombosis with loss of radial arterial pulse, and permanent median nerve neuropathy caused by hematoma have all been reported as complications of brachial cannulation. On the other hand, the literature associated with left heart catheterization states that percutaneous cannulation of the brachial artery is as \"safe and effective\" as surgical cutdown and arteriotomy. 216 Venous blood gases (VBG) are increasingly used as alternative samples to estimate systemic carbon dioxide and pH that do not require ABG sampling.

[221] [222] [223] [224] [225] In clinical studies there is good agreement for pH and HCO 3 \u2212 between ABG and VBG in COPD patients, but not for PCO 2 or PO 2 . To avoid misleading results, clinicians should avoid VBG in hemodynamically unstable patients and rely on ABGs instead. [226] [227] [228] If serial monitoring of critically ill patients is done routinely, VBG and ABG should be compared periodically. Widespread clinical use of VBG is limited because of the lack of validation studies on clinical outcomes. 229 An alternative to arterial puncture is to obtain a sample of \"arterialized\" capillary or venous blood. The assumption is that the vasodilation produced by heat or by application of vasodilator cream to a region with low metabolic activity will result in delivery of such an excess of arterial blood that local metabolism causes only small changes in PO 2 , PCO 2 , and pH. Under these circumstances, analysis of capillary or venous blood should provide close estimates of arterial values. The sites most commonly used for capillary sampling are the earlobe in adults and children and the lateral margin of the foot in infants; for sampling of arterialized venous blood, a dorsal hand vein is most commonly used. From any of these sites, the values obtained correlate well with arterial pH and PCO 2 . 230 The values for PO 2 are also accurate, except in patients with arterial hypotension or local reductions in flow to the sample site (as may develop with the vasoconstrictive response to severe hypoxemia), in newborns, and in patients with high arterial PO 2 (i.e., breathing oxygen-enriched gas mixtures).",

The basic idea of the transcutaneous electrode is that a small polarographic electrode can measure the oxygen pressure in a bubble of gas trapped over the skin. Because the PO 2 at the surface of unwarmed skin is near zero, the success of the transcutaneous oxygen electrode depends on producing enough local vasodilation to compensate for the arterial-capillary gradient and also for the further loss of oxygen due to skin metabolism and imperfect diffusion of oxygen through the skin layer. This degree of vasodilation is achieved by warming the skin to 42\u00b0 C. The increase in temperature causes local vasodilation and displaces the hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right. Thus the oxygen pressure is increased for any blood oxygen pressure, partially correcting for the losses of oxygen between the arterioles and the skin surface.",

Not surprisingly, transcutaneous PO 2 most severely underestimates arterial PO 2 when skin perfusion is decreased from hypotension. Arterial PO 2 was also underestimated in infants treated with tolazoline for pulmonary hypertension, possibly because the general peripheral vasodilation caused by the drug exceeded the effect of the preferential local vasodilation intended from local heating of the skin. These problems have not prevented the application of this noninvasive device for regulating oxygen therapy or ventilatory assistance to infants with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, for monitoring apnea, for sleep studies, or for analyzing the impact of nursery procedures on oxygenation. The technique is not as well accepted for estimating PO 2 in adults, in whom the greater thickness of skin impairs oxygen diffusion. Carter and Banham 236 reported that transcutaneous electrodes for measuring PO 2 and PCO 2 during exercise in adults with a variety of pulmonary disorders were reliable, provided the electrodes were kept at a slightly higher temperature (45\u00b0 C) and the work rate intervals were gradual to allow for the slow response time. Unfortunately, most other workers have failed to confirm these findings, 237 although the technique appears reliable for measuring the direction of change in arterial PO 2 in adult patients performing exercise 238, 239 or during sleep studies.",

The measurement of carbon dioxide during the respiratory cycle is called capnometry, and the display of the analog waveform is called a capnogram (eFig. . This measurement can be made using an infrared spectrometer, which is widely available. Care must be taken to calibrate the instrument regularly and to avoid interference by nitrous oxide, acetylene, and carbon monoxide. 240 A mass spectrometer can be used to measure all the respiratory gases (carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen) as well as many anesthetic gases. This device is very rapid but very expensive. It is used most commonly in pulmonary and exercise laboratories and in operating rooms where sample gases from several patients may be tested in sequence. Capnography is valuable in detecting successful tracheal intubation versus esophageal intubation and in monitoring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Capnography is also useful in detecting a variety of problems in ventilated patients, including an obstructed endotracheal tube, a disconnected airway, ventilator malfunction, severe pulmonary hypoperfusion, and pulmonary embolism. [241] [242] [243] The end-tidal carbon dioxide may decrease suddenly in a life-threatening situation such as ventilator malfunction or a disconnected airway, as illustrated in eFigure 25-25. The end-tidal carbon dioxide data may be misleading when dead space is increased (increased anatomic dead space, dead space added in series to the airway of the patient, abnormally increased respiratory rate). In these situations there is an increased difference between arterial and end-tidal carbon dioxide, and the end-tidal level does not plateau. When wasted ventilation is increased because of regional increased ventilation relative to perfusion (e.g., restrictive or obstructive ventilatory defects, parallel dead space, or pulmonary vascular obstruction), differences between arterial and end-tidal carbon dioxide are also increased. In these situations the alveolar plateau is present but abnormally reduced. The shape of the waveform may be diagnostic of pulmonary vascular obstruction (eFig. [25] [26] .",

Extravascular on-demand blood-gas analysis appears accurate, allows monitoring of trends of blood-gas changes, and decreases the risk for infection, the therapeutic decision time involved, and blood loss.

Although a variety of stimuli have been used, including exercise and eucapnic ventilation, the most common stimuli are histamine and methacholine. Responses to these stimuli have good correlation and reproducibility. 261 These agents are delivered in incremental concentrations until a desired in a clinically defined population. Furthermore, when applied to a patient population, they resulted in selection of the most obstructed patients (a contradiction of the definition of reversibility). Instead, these authors suggested that the difference in FEV 1 before and after bronchodilator administration (expressed either as an absolute value or as a percentage of predicted FEV 1 ) appeared more appropriate as an expression of reversibility. Their study indicated that, when one compares results from two different bronchodilator studies, careful attention must be paid to the definitions of patient populations, the definitions of obstruction and reversibility, the degree of obstruction present, and the methods used to calculate bronchodilator response. Jain et al 258 studied 321 physician-diagnosed asthmatic patients and found a significant proportion had increased RV and abnormal RV/TLC ratio in the presence of normal FEV 1 /FVC ratio and no significant bronchodilator response. Failure to demonstrate significant responses to acute bronchodilator therapy does not rule out reversible airway obstruction. Many reports confirm that asthmatic patients with completely reversible airway obstruction may initially fail to respond to inhaled bronchodilators. 259 In fact, one of the pharmacologic benefits attributed to corticosteroids in this situation is that they enhance responsiveness to \u03b2-adrenergic agonists. 260 We have observed that many patients with severe chronic airflow obstruction are undertreated with the usual treatment regimens. These patients show significant bronchodilation during exercise and in response to increased \u03b2-adrenergic treatment.",

However, the maximal effect of ipratropium bromide may take 30 to 45 minutes. Furthermore, many patients with reversible airway obstruction do not respond to a standard clinical dose of either class of dilator, but airway obstruction still reverses completely if they are treated with larger doses. Thus, in some patients with airway obstruction who have never been treated before and who do not respond to a standard clinical dose of inhaled dilator, we often administer a cumulative dose-response protocol. Spirometry is measured before (baseline) and 15 minutes after administration of progressively increasing doses of albuterol (180 \u00b5g) or ipratropium bromide (36 \u00b5g) aerosol. The aerosol is administered every 15 minutes until a maximal increase in FEV 1 or FVC is attained or limiting symptoms are reached.

In certain obstructive ventilatory defects, a variety of specific tests may prove useful. For example, in a patient with a localized bulla who is being considered for surgical resection of the lesion, it is important to show that the bulla, and not intrinsic airway disease or emphysema, is responsible for the pulmonary function abnormalities and disability. An exercise study can quantitate the disability caused by the bulla or associated disease. Physiologic studies relating RAW and Vmax to static PL can differentiate the effects of loss of lung elastic recoil from those of intrinsic airway disease. Radioisotope perfusion lung scans, pulmonary angiograms, and thin-section CT scans can determine whether the vascular defects are localized (i.e., bullae) or diffuse (i.e., emphysema). These studies may also indicate whether the bulla is compressing normal lung tissue. This possibility can be confirmed by a shunt study to determine whether compression of normal lung effect on pulmonary function is achieved; usually, less than 0.1 mg/mL is the initial concentration to avoid inducing an inordinately severe reaction.",

Medications, baseline airway function, respiratory infections, and exposure to specific allergens and chemical sensitizers influence responses. Bronchodilators, antihistamines, and other agents that decrease bronchial responsiveness should be withheld before the test. 262 Compared to methacholine and histamine, which have direct effects on airway smooth muscle to cause airway narrowing, so-called indirect challenge tests (which cause airway narrowing indirectly by triggering mast cell degranulation by osmotic stimuli, or mediator release from inflammatory cells) may have an important place in the assessment of asthma. Such indirect challenge tests (including exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction, eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea, hypertonic and hypotonic aerosols, and mannitol) are useful for monitoring treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. 263 Indirect tests identify subjects with the potential for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and therefore are useful for members of the armed services, firefighters, police, and elite athletes. A positive indirect test result suggests that inflammatory cells and their mediators are present in sufficient numbers and concentration to indicate that asthma is active at the time of the test. A negative test result in a known asthmatic patient means good control or mild disease. Healthy subjects do not experience bronchoconstriction during the indirect tests. 263 Although histamine and methacholine are wellestablished agents for identifying airway hyperresponsiveness, the response to these agonists is not specific for the diagnosis of asthma. Both agents are better at excluding the diagnosis of asthma than making the diagnosis. Furthermore, neither agonist can establish or exclude the diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma, so they are not appropriate for assessment of persons at occupational risk or of athletes. Identification of airway hyperresponsiveness by pharmacologic agents does not indicate who will respond to inhaled corticosteroids, nor does it distinguish between the effects of different doses of steroids. Many asthmatic patients remain reactive to histamine and methacholine long after treatment, so airway hyperresponsiveness is not useful as a guide to withdrawal from steroid treatment.",

A positive response to mannitol depends on activation of mast cells secondary to osmotic changes in the airways, release of leukotrienes and other mediators, and development of active inflammation in the airways. 263 If the mannitol response is positive, sufficient numbers of inflammatory cells are present to release enough mediators to cause bronchoconstriction. The response to mannitol is reduced by corticosteroid therapy and may disappear within 6 to 8 weeks. Thus mannitol responsiveness may be able to predict the risk for a clinical flare during reduction of the corticosteroid dose. Mannitol alone may be able to identify those patients who will respond to inhaled corticosteroids and also (in patients already treated with corticosteroids) serve to guide the reduction of the steroid dose.

The implications for selection criteria are straightforward: if increased FEV 1 is the goal of LVRS, then the optimal candidates are those with the highest RV/TLC. Finally, the critical factor in comparing outcomes among patients, procedures, or centers is the amount of lung removed, which cannot be estimated accurately by weighing the resected specimens. Fessler and Permutt 280 suggested that the best measurement of the fraction of lung resected may be derived from the ratio of residual volumes: 1 \u2212 RV A /RV B , where RV A is the residual volume before LVRS and RV B is the residual volume after LVRS. Several studies have examined the mechanisms responsible for improved function in these patients. Fessler and associates 281 studied 78 patients and found that the results supported their model, as discussed previously; that is, RV/TLC is an important predictor of improvement in FVC because it reflects the mismatch in size between the hyperinflated lungs and the surrounding chest, and increased FVC is an important determinant of increased FEV 1 after LVRS. Ingenito and associates 282 performed an elegant study of 37 patients undergoing LVRS and found that increased FEV 1 (increased by 28% \u00b1 44%) correlated closely with increase in maximal flow of 78% \u00b1 132%. The increased expiratory flow was largely due to increased lung recoil pressure, and FEV 1 improved without changes in small airway conductance, airway closing pressure, or lung compliance. These results support the Fessler and Permutt concept that \"resizing of the lung to the chest wall\" is the primary mechanism by which LVRS improves function. In another study, Mineo and colleagues 283 showed dramatic improvement in right heart function during exercise following LVRS; furthermore, the improvement in right ventricular ejection fraction during exercise correlated closely with the change in RV/TLC ratio, also supporting the Fessler and Permutt theory.",

They noted that most patients undergoing LVRS show improved expiratory flow and less hyperinflation and air trapping. These effects result from increased lung elastic recoil and better matching of lung and rib cage size, which also leads to decreased respiratory pressure required for tidal breathing and decreased cost of carbon dioxide removal. The mechanisms responsible for these benefits include improved alveolar ventilation, decreased operating lung volumes, decreased dynamic positive end-expiratory pressure, and decreased dynamic lung and chest wall stiffness. According to Laghi and Tobin, the surgery also improves the length-tension relationship of the respiratory muscles.

Radioisotope ventilation lung scans also help determine whether the ventilatory defects are localized (i.e., bullae) or diffuse (i.e., emphysema). The single-breath DL CO is useful for detecting decreased numbers of pulmonary capillaries, reflecting the presence of pulmonary emphysema. Measurement of \"trapped gas\" by comparison of TLC measured by single-breath gas dilution and by body plethysmography should provide an estimate of the size of the bulla. This same multipronged approach may be useful for evaluating patients with advanced emphysema before consideration for possible surgical treatment (see later discussion).",

They extended their analysis from LVRS to previously published data on mechanical properties of the lungs in patients with alpha 1antitrypsin deficiency, COPD, and asthma. In each of these diseases, a major determinant of airflow limitation is the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC). Their analysis suggested that RV/TLC determines the improvement in pulmonary function following surgical treatment of emphysema. Regardless of the underlying disease, impaired airflow appears to be due to the mismatch between the size of the lung and the size of the chest wall; surgical resection of lung tissue improves the matching.

Colebatch and coworkers 309 showed that the index of curvature in the exponential expression of lung elastic recoil (see \"Lung Elastic Recoil\" section) increases with age. They concluded that this change was related to increased alveolar size. These findings were confirmed by Knudson and Kaltenborn, 310 and morphologic studies have confirmed the increased alveolar dimensions. The effect of age on airflow rates depends on whether the data are based on crosssectional studies or longitudinal studies. Burrows and associates 311 found that the progressive decline in FVC and FEV 1 did not begin until the middle 30s, and that the subsequent particularly in cases involving financial compensation, the pulmonary function tests must be carried out as part of a complete clinical evaluation, and the evaluating physician involved must observe the test results generated. Nevertheless, \"poor cooperation\" can usually be identified on the basis of the features listed in Table 25 -6. The VC is decreased and does not show a smooth curve, reaching a maximum value. The decreased VC is often accompanied by relatively normal expiratory airflow, increased FEV 1 /FVC ratio, and decreased MVV. Supplemental data confirming invalid test results include uneven, slurred, or notched curves on inspection; poor reproducibility on repeated testing; and decreased maximum lung elastic recoil pressure. A valid restrictive pattern differs from a test with poor effort in that it is reproducible and shows smooth expiratory curves on direct examination, increased lung elastic recoil, and a normal or nearly normal MVV.",

Reduction in the supply of vital metabolic substrates may limit the efficiency of respiratory muscles under certain circumstances.

Disease processes and inactivity may alter the number and relative proportions of fibers in the diaphragm. Under certain conditions, changes in the distribution of fiber types or the loss of fibers may play an important role in the development or maintenance of respiratory failure. For example, atrophy of respiratory muscles is a potentially important problem in patients undergoing long-term mechanical ventilation. 326 Muscular efficiency depends on mechanical factors as well as on structure. 284 The position and configuration of the diaphragm at the beginning of inspiration determines the resting length of the muscle fibers. As FRC increases, the contour of the diaphragm flattens, and muscle fibers are not stretched to their optimal length. Acute hyperinflation (as in asthma) may cause a mechanical disadvantage of the diaphragm by shortening muscle fibers. In addition to changing muscle fiber length, hyperinflation also causes a mechanical disadvantage by changing the shape of the diaphragm. The Pdi max is determined by the radius of curvature of the diaphragm at any value of muscle tension (Laplace's law). Thus, increasing the radius of curvature of the diaphragm (i.e., flattening the diaphragm) greatly reduces its capacity to develop Pdi and to change lung volume.",

Furthermore, the curvilinear relationship between pressure and volume means that a greater loss of muscle strength (pressure) is required to produce a loss of volume; for example, a 50% decrease in MIP is associated with only a 15% decrease in VC. Although MIP may be reduced markedly before lung volume decreases, most patients with respiratory muscle weakness have decreased VC and decreased lung compliance. The latter finding is thought to result from atelectasis, which may be detectable in chest radiographs. FRC, inspiratory capacity, expiratory reserve volume, and TLC may also be decreased in decline in FEV 1 /FVC was linear with age, independent of FVC, similar in men and women, and much less severe than that described in cross-sectional studies. Gelb and Zamel 312 reported decreased maximal flows but no change in lung elastic recoil pressure or RAW with age, suggesting that airway collapsibility increased with age. More recently, Babb and Rodarte 313 confirmed work by Janssens and coworkers, 314 indicating that decreases in maximal expiratory airflow and in the minimum pressure needed to generate maximal flow in older subjects were due to decreased static lung elastic recoil compared with that in younger subjects. VC decreases with age, whereas RV and closing volume increase with age, 315 suggesting that lung emptying is limited with increasing age because of airway closure (see earlier discussion). 316 MVV decreases approximately 30% between 30 and 70 years of age, probably as a consequence of decreased maximal respiratory pressures, decreased distensibility of the total respiratory system, decreased lung elastic recoil, and impaired coordination of the respiratory muscles.",

The maximally negative airway pressure measures the maximally negative airway pressure generated by an inspiratory effort against an occluded airway. In this test the subject inspires maximally from RV against an obstructed mouthpiece with a small leak (1 mm in diameter) to prevent closure of the glottis or development of pressure above the glottis by the muscles of the cheeks. A plateau pressure should be maintained for at least 1 second. Reproducible maximal values are difficult to obtain; the coefficient of variation is about 9% for duplicate tests for the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and the maximal expiratory pressure (MEP). 320 MAXIMUM TRANSDIAPHRAGMATIC PRESSURE. Pdi max is measured during the same maneuver by determining the difference between intragastric and esophageal pressures. These pressures should be measured at RV because maximally negative airway pressure is reduced at larger lung volumes. Conversely, MEPs are greatest at TLC. Because it is difficult to obtain cooperation from patients to exhale to RV, MIP, MEP, and Pdi max are often measured at FRC (which probably accounts in part for the reported variability). Healthy persons can sustain respiratory patterns requiring 40% of Pdi max for long periods without fatigue. When a patient must increase the Pdi/Pdi max ratio to overcome a resistive load, endurance decreases in proportion to the resistive load (eFig. [25] [26] [27] . Normal subjects can inspire with varying degrees of diaphragm and rib cage contraction. Thus Pdi max may be decreased because of marked recruitment of the rib cage during the test. The range reported is accordingly large: 18 to 137 cm H 2 O. Training results in improved coordination and reproducible values with a coefficient of variation of 19%. 321 Similowski and colleagues 322 have reported the use of cervical magnetic stimulation (CMS) as a method of phrenic nerve stimulation. They reported the results of comparisons of stimulated Pdi with the maximal Pdi obtained during the static combined expulsive-Mueller maneuver (Pdi max ) and with the Pdi generated during a sniff test. Their results were comparable to those obtained in other studies using transcutaneous phrenic stimulation. They were highly reproducible in all the subjects. EMG data provided evidence of bilateral maximal stimulation. CMS is a nonspecific method and may stimulate various nervous structures. Cocontraction of neck muscles, including the sternomastoid, was present, but its influence in the CMS-induced Pdi appeared minimal. The method appears to avoid the pain of transcutaneous phrenic stimulation and the potential danger of needle stimulation of the phrenic nerves. However, subsequent studies showed that CMS stimulated many muscles of the upper thoracic cage as well as the diaphragm. Investigators have used chest wall electrodes to record the diaphragm compound action potential to assess the extent of stimulation of other muscles. 323 Although initially promising, these studies have demonstrated difficulty in obtaining surface signals of acceptable quality. 324 The variable shape and latency of the action potential induced by magnetic stimulation plus the shorter phrenic nerve conduction times with CMS compared with electrical stimulation indicate that diaphragm EMG after CMS is potentially unreliable, perhaps because chest wall electrodes also record electrical activity from other muscles. As demonstrated by Luo and associates, 325 the method also appears unreliable for the measurement of phrenic nerve conduction time.",

This is another technique used to evaluate respiratory muscle strength and endurance. Changes in respiratory muscle electrical activity appear to reflect closely other aspects of muscle contraction. Normally the phrenic nerve stimulates the diaphragm at a mixture of frequencies between 20 and 400 Hz. A graphic display of the EMG signal strength against frequency is called the power spectrum. When the EMG is analyzed over two limited frequency ranges (<50 Hz and >150 Hz), the power spectrum shifts to the low-frequency range as the diaphragm fatigues. This change precedes failure of contraction, and it therefore may be useful to predict decompensation of the respiratory muscles. Phrenic nerve conduction time may also be used to assess diaphragmatic paralysis or weakness. With recording electrodes placed over the rib cage above the diaphragm, the phrenic nerve is stimulated in the neck. Normal conduction time is 7.7 \u00b1 0.8 msec.",

The surface area of the dome also becomes smaller on the side of the graft compared with controls. 329 This effect results from mediastinal displacement toward the graft, due to the lesser lung elastic recoil of the native (emphysematous) lung and greater lung elastic recoil of the graft. The disparity in elastic recoil may be increased if the graft is infected or undergoes rejection. It has also been suggested that mediastinal shift toward the graft may reflect dynamic hyperinflation of the native lung. Such dynamic hyperinflation seems unlikely because single-lung transplants do not show flow limitation during tidal breathing except during maximal exercise. 330 Mediastinal displacement is usually counterbalanced by equal expansion of the rib cage on the side of the graft. Compensatory expansion of the rib cage on the graft side is not always sufficient to accommodate expansion of the contralateral hyperinflated lung.

Using this family of curves, it is possible to determine the diameter of a critical orifice in a patient with upper airway obstruction. Assuming a driving pressure of 100 cm H 2 O, the diameter is given by the curve closest to the maximum flow observed in the flow plateau obtained from the flow-volume loop obtained from the patient. Curves were constructed by using graded external resistances in a normal subject. In this constantpressure, variable-volume type of plethysmograph, the subject also breathes through a shutter/pneumotachygraph apparatus, which usually is located outside the plethysmograph itself. The shutter is open for tidal breathing, measurement of airway resistance, and spirometry. It is closed for measurement of thoracic gas volume. In the closed-shutter mode, mouth pressure is measured by a transducer (1) and approximates alveolar pressure with no flow and small volume changes. The pneumotachygraph measures flow via another transducer (2, above the pneumotachygraph). Flow is integrated electronically to obtain volume. Changes in volume of the plethysmograph, reflecting movement of the chest wall, are measured with a spirometer and a linear volume-displacement transducer (LVDT). The spirometer illustrated is a Krogh water-sealed spirometer with good frequency response and very small impedance to gas displacement. A low-resistance pneumotachygraph (flowmeter) with a fast, drift-free integrator may be used instead. Processing is usually performed by computer and permits slow and forced vital capacity maneuvers as well. However, neither approach is routine. The shutter is open for tidal breathing, measurement of airway resistance, and spirometry. It is closed for measurement of thoracic gas volume. In the closed position, mouth pressure (alveolar pressure) is measured by a transducer (top). The pneumotachygraph at the mouth (pneumotachygraph 1) measures airflow with another transducer (middle). This airflow at the mouth is integrated to obtain volume inhaled and exhaled at the mouth. Changes in plethysmograph or box volume resulting from movements of the chest wall are measured by a pneumotachygraph in the wall of the plethysmograph (pneumotachygraph 2) with a third transducer (bottom), and this signal is integrated to obtain volume change of the thorax. The signals from all three transducers usually are processed by computer to obtain slow and forced vital capacities as well as resistance and thoracic gas volumes.",

            "text": "Pneumotachygraph 1 Shutter Transducer eFigure 25-4 Physical principles underlying pressure-volume plethysmography. A, The theoretical \"true\" instantaneous volume event. During this event, plethysmographic pressure increases rapidly and then decays exponentially (B). If the plethysmographic pneumotachygraph is linear, the flow signal has a shape similar to that of the pressure transducer (C). This flow signal is integrated to obtain volume (D), which reaches the same level as the true volume event, but the shape does not conform to the \"true\" event. The difference is a result of the compression of a large volume of gas in the plethysmograph and is directly proportional to the plethysmograph pressure. Therefore, by adding a portion of the plethysmograph pressure to the integrated plethysmograph flow (E), the true volume event is reconstructed accurately: \u0394V = Pbox + Vbox \u222b . Thus the true volume is obtained by adding the plethysmographic compression volume (Pbox) and the displacement volume ( Vbox \u222b ). More precisely, (1) box pressure (Pbox) is multiplied by a constant (Kbox), a factor to correct pressure to volume that is proportional to the gas volume in the box (total box volume \u2212 patient volume); and (2) Pbox is also divided by the box flowmeter resistance (Rbox) to yield box flow ( Vbox), and integrated to obtain volume (Vbox). These two signals are added together to yield the change in lung volume: \u0394V = PboxKbox + Pbox/Rbox Vbox A loudspeaker may be driven to produce a sinusoidal oscillation at a single frequency, a sequence of sinusoidal oscillations at diverse single frequencies, or a random noise signal. The flow signal is integrated to yield tidal volume or, at the end of the study, inspiratory capacity. The recorded signals for mouth pressure (Pmo) and flow ( Vmo) are directed to a Fourier analyzer, and the component of each signal caused by the applied oscillation is differentiated from changes caused by tidal breathing. Impedance (Zrs) is calculated over a wide range of frequencies. The impedance is subdivided into the in-phase and out-of-phase components of the primary signals. The in-phase signal is the resistance of the total respiratory system (Rrs), and the out-of-phase signal is the reactance (Xrs), sometimes called the imaginary part of the impedance. The reactance is related to the compliance and inertance of the respiratory system (see text). Top, Schematic illustration of a ventilatory unit near the lung apex (dark blue) and a ventilatory unit near the base (light blue) subtended by a common airway. The intensity of color reflects the end-inspiratory concentration of the resident gas (N 2 ) at the end of a single maximal inspiration of pure oxygen (O 2 ) (at total lung capacity [TLC]). The differences in N 2 concentration in each unit result from the effect of differences in regional residual volume (RV) and the distribution of inspired gas (see text). Bottom, At the start of exhalation, the gas (pure oxygen) in the conducting airway empties first, and 0% N 2 is recorded (phase I). As exhalation continues, gas from both ventilatory units mixes in the airway, and the N 2 concentration increases rapidly (phase II). With continued exhalation, mixed alveolar gas is recorded by the N 2 analyzer (phase III). Finally, dependent airways at the base of the lungs close near RV (closing volume), and exhalation continues from the apical ventilatory unit of the lung only, which contains a higher N 2 concentration than the basal unit (phase IV).",

Morphometric analysis showed that 21% of the alveolar walls were occupied by red blood cells in zone I lobes, 43% in zone II lobes, and 61% in zone III lobes. Independent changes in pulmonary arterial or venous pressure were associated with changes in the pulmonary capillary blood volume over a threefold range. (From Vriem CE, Staub NC: Pulmonary vascular pressures and capillary blood volume changes in anesthetized cats.

As the alveolar PO 2 was increased from 40 mm Hg to 600 mm Hg, the duplicate measurements of DL CO decreased from approximately 45 to 15 mL/min per mm Hg. Changing alveolar PO 2 changes the reaction coefficient (\u03b8), reflecting the change in hemoglobin affinity for carbon monoxide. The reaction coefficient is plotted against 1/DL CO in A. There is a linear relationship between 1/DL CO and 1/\u03b8 such that 1/DL CO = 1/\u03b8VC + 1/DM. Under these conditions, DM is derived from the value of the y-intercept and VC from the slope of the line. Top, The single-breath DL CO , expressed as the log of the percentage of predicted normal, is displayed on the ordinate. Emphysema grade is displayed on the abscissa and was determined by the panel grading method on lung tissue resected from these patients within 1 week of pulmonary function testing. The solid line is the line of best fit (r = \u22120.73), the outer dashed lines show the 95% confidence limits for the points, and the inner dashed lines show the 95% confidence limits for the line. The single-breath DL CO correlates with the presence and amount of emphysema except when emphysema is mild (grades 0 to 30); when single-breath DL CO was plotted against emphysema for patients with minimal disease (grades 0 to 30), there was no significant correlation. Bottom, The intrabreath DL CO , expressed as the log of the percentage of predicted normal at 50% exhaled vital capacity, is displayed on the ordinate. Emphysema grade is displayed on the abscissa and was determined by the panel grading method on lung tissue resected from these patients within 1 week of pulmonary function testing. The solid line is the line of best fit (r = \u22120.77), the outer dashed lines show the 95% confidence limits for the points, and the inner dashed lines show the 95% confidence limits for the line. Thus the intrabreath DL CO correlates with the presence and amount of emphysema even when emphysema is mild (grades 0 to 30) and cannot be detected or quantified by the single-breath method. for two experiments on the same subject. In one experiment, the steadystate points were defined by inhalation of each of four carbon dioxide mixtures for 20 minutes without intervening periods of air breathing. In the other experiment, the steady-state points were defined by inhalation of each carbon dioxide mixture for 30 minutes, with an intervening rest period of 30 minutes. The figure illustrates a difference in position of the response lines due to a smaller PCO 2 gradient between arterial blood and chemoreceptor tissue during the rebreathing method. The close agreement in slope implies that the ratio of change in end-tidal PCO 2 to change in chemoreceptor PCO 2 is the same in the two methods. 50 eFigure 25-16 Assessment of regional lung function using xenon-133 ( 133 Xe). Top, After injection, the initial peak reflects the regional blood flow ( QC ); the isotope then passes into the gas phase, in which the clearance during normal breathing reflects the ventilation of lung tissue that is perfused. A slow washout indicates a low ventilation-perfusion ratio ( V /Q A C). Bottom, During rebreathing, the plateau count rate when mixing is complete reflects the volume of lung gas in the field of counting. The slopes of the wash-in and washout curves indicate the ventilation per unit volume. The structure of a pH electrode, which comprises two cells. The measurement half-cell consists of a fine capillary tube of pH-sensitive glass separating the introduced sample of 25 \u00b5L from the buffered solution and a silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode to conduct the generated potential difference to the electronic circuitry. The reference half-cell usually contains a calomel (mercury/mercurous chloride) electrode in an electrolyte solution to provide a constant reference voltage and is connected to the measurement half-cell by a contact bridge to complete the circuit. Both cells are enclosed in a sealed jacket and maintained at a constant temperature. KCl, potassium chloride. Hb Extinction (x 10) eFigure 25-24 Normal capnogram. During inspiration, PCO 2 is zero. At the start of exhalation, PCO 2 remains zero as gas from the anatomic dead space leaves the airway (comparable to phase I in the single-breath nitrogen washout test). Next, PCO 2 rises rapidly as alveolar gas mixes with gas from the dead space (comparable to phase II in the single-breath nitrogen washout test), and then the PCO 2 level stabilizes as gas from the dead space decreases and all the gas comes from alveoli containing carbon dioxide. The PCO 2 at the end of the \"alveolar plateau\" is called the end-tidal PCO 2 (comparable to phase III in the single-breath nitrogen washout test). The sudden decrease in end-tidal PCO 2 suggests a life-threatening situation in which the capnograph no longer detects carbon dioxide in the exhaled gas. This capnogram suggests the possibility of esophageal intubation, obstructed endotracheal tube, disconnected airway, or ventilator malfunction; these possibilities must be excluded before it can be assumed that the capnograph is malfunctioning.

Capacities: There are four capacities, each of which contains two or more primary volumes: (1) total lung capacity (TLC) is the amount of gas contained in the lung at maximal inspiration; (2) vital capacity (VC) is the maximal volume of gas that can be expelled from the lungs by a forceful effort following maximal inspiration, without regard for the time involved; (3) inspiratory capacity (IC) is the maximal volume of gas that can be inspired from the resting expiratory level; and (4) functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume of gas in the lungs at resting end-expiration.

The magnitude of PPA or PPV is indicated by the height of the fluid columns. For simplicity, the pressure in alveoli (Palv) is assumed to be equal to atmospheric pressure. Single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DL CO ) is given in arbitrary units indicating the relative contribution of various zones of the lung. A, In the control state, at the bottom of the lung, both PPA and PPV are greater than Palv, and both keep the capillaries open. In the middle zone, PPA is greater than Palv and PPV, so PPA holds capillaries open.(The exact anatomy of capillaries in the zone in which Palv is greater than PPV is unknown; in the diagram, the compressed segment at the end of the capillary is meant to suggest a \"Starling resistor\" effect.) In the upper zone, Palv is greater than PPA and PPV, and capillaries are \"collapsed.\" B, When arterial inflow is occluded to the lower zone (indicated by red solid sphere), PPV is greater than Palv, so the capillaries in this zone remain distended and DL CO is unchanged. C, When arterial inflow to the middle zone is occluded, Palv is greater than PPV and capillaries in this area are collapsed, so there is a decrease in DL CO . D, When arterial inflow to the upper zone is occluded, the capillaries are already collapsed, so there is no change in DL CO . E, When arterial inflows to the lower and middle zones are occluded simultaneously, capillaries in the middle zone may collapse. However, if PPA increases, capillaries in the upper zone may become distended, and the net result may be no change in DL CO . Under these circumstances, if PPV also increases (F), DL CO may actually increase.
