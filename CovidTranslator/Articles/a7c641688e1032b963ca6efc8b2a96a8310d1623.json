To the best of our knowledge, no attempts at quantitatively predicting the effect of 533 sequence variation exist to date. We used our measurements of frameshifting signal of thousands of 534 variants of known PRF sites to build a computational model based on known and novel sequence 535 features affecting frameshifting, leading to accurate prediction of frameshifting potential (up to ROC 536 AUC=0.93) and frameshifting rates (up to Pearson r=0.81). In many cases sequence properties other 537 than slippery site identity or downstream secondary structure rigidity yielded high prediction scores, 538 emphasizing the importance to include additional features such as amino acid properties and tRNA 539 availability in the investigation of PRF regulation. 540",

For example, no universally optimal slippery site exists, but in each of the PRF events 545 tested the native slippery site was found to be optimal given the sequence context. In addition, our analyses highlighted amino acid properties around the frameshifting sites as another 570 factor influencing PRF efficiency. Specifically, a charged amino acid at the last position before the 571 slippery site was associated with reduced frameshifting rate. Together with reports of a frameshift-572 promoting effect of specific amino-acid sequences upstream of the frameshifting site in the case of 573 +1 PRF in fungal OAZ genes (Yordanova et al., 2015) and the copA gene of Escherichia coli (Meydan 574 et al., 2017) , this observation provides additional evidence for a role of the nascent peptide in 575 regulating ribosomal frameshifting. 576",

More than in other 594 cases, maintaining the wild-type slippery site UUUUUUA is crucial for frameshifting, and tends to be 595 absolutely invariable across otherwise diverse natural isolates (Biswas et al., 2004) . The quantitative 596 nature of our assay allows us nevertheless to accurately quantify the effect of sequence variation 597 away from the slippery site, revealing sub-type specific differences. Furthermore, we devised a 598 machine learning model that is able to predict the natural variation in HIV frameshifting rates for novel 599 variants (Pearson r=0.60).

We then created for each PRF event two sets of ten sequences each (using antaRNA) that 672 are predicted to fold into the downstream secondary structure as determined using ViennaRNA and 673 pKiss, respectively. Furthermore we designed variants of the predicted HIV, SRV1 and nsp2F 674 (PRRSV) downstream secondary structure, e.g. by extending or reducing the length of hairpins, and 675 completely synthetic secondary structures and again used antaRNA to create sets of corresponding 676 sequences that we used to replace the native downstream structure in all 15 PRF events.

As we do not find evidence for an effect of MFE on overall RNA levels (Fig S7, 363S8, S9; e.g. through triggering No-Go decay(Belew et al., 2011)), we suggest that this reflects a 364 strong preference for downstream secondary structure rigidity to be close to that of the wild-type 365 sequence (in particular for SARS, SRV1 and HERV-K10,Fig S7, S8, right panels). Although present 366 secondary structure prediction algorithms might not be sufficiently accurate for this task, especially in 367 the case of pseudoknots, our results support a view according to which not only the structure, but also 368 the sequence downstream of a slippery site is critical for triggering frameshifting.369 370 Additional regulatory elements contribute to PRF 371 The distance between the slippery site and the downstream secondary structure has been shown to 372 be important for efficient frameshifting (Brierley et al., 1989; Kollmus et al., 1994; Lin et al., 2012), 373 probably to position the paused ribosome at the slippery site (Brierley and Pennell, 2001). To test 374whether this is generally true or if there are PRF event-specific differences, we introduced between 375 one and nine nucleotides from different constant sequences or deleted between one and six, mutating 376 downstream stop codons as required(Fig 4A top). Most insertions or deletions led to substantially 377 reduced frameshifting signal(Fig 4B), no matter what the context and if the original downstream 378 coding frame was preserved or not, suggesting that the exact position of the downstream regulatory 379 elements is important across PRF events. This is in contrast to an earlier study reporting unchanged 380 or even dramatically increased -1 frameshifting efficiency at the HIV site upon reducing spacer 381 lengths, which the authors attribute to a change in local secondary structure triggered by the specific 382 deletion introduced in their construct(Mouzakis et al., 2013). Overall, our results are in line with the 383 regulatory elements being in optimal distance from one another and the downstream secondary 384 structure creating a roadblock that causes the ribosome to pause exactly at the slippery site(Brierley  385    and Pennell, 2001;Tu et al., 1992). 386",

Our results corroborate the functional link between minimum 550 free energy of downstream structures and show that this is true for most PRF events tested. However, 551 this correlation generally depended on the length of the downstream region taken into account, in 552 agreement with the specific association between PRF efficiency and thermodynamic stability of the 553 start of the HIV stem loop structure reported earlier (Mouzakis et al., 2013). Furthermore, the 554 correlation between PRF signal and MFE only held true when testing small variations of the native 555 sequence and structure; when sequences and structures different from the native one were tested, 556 this correlation was lost. 557 Slippery site and a downstream stimulatory signal are central -and therefore intensely studied -558 regulatory elements present in all known PRF events. Here, we expanded the repertoire of regulatory 559 inputs and demonstrated that both tRNA availability as well as amino acid properties can affect PRF 560 efficiencies across native sequence contexts. 561 Ribosome stalling due to limited tRNA availability has the potential to lead to slippage of the ribosome 562 (Gallant and Lindsley, 1992; Weiss et al., 1988) and contributes to non-programmed frameshifting in 563 huntingtin (Girstmair et al., 2013). Availability of tRNAs decoding slippery site codons have been 564 shown to influence HIV gag-pol frameshifting efficiency (Korniy et al., 2019) and HIV-1 itself has the 565 ability to modulate the tRNA pool of the host cell (van Weringh et al., 2011). Our observation that 566 limited tRNA availability in the codons leading up to the slippery site progressively contributes to PRF 567 efficiency is in line with these data and expands the notion of an influence of the tRNA pool on 568 frameshifting beyond the slippery site codons and individual PRF events. 569",

In addition to deciphering the effect of cis-606 regulatory elements, regulation by trans-acting factors like the recently discovered case of the 607 frameshift repressor shiftless (Wang et al., 2019) constitutes another area where a systematic 608 approach like the one presented here can yield novel insights into the mode of action and its 609 specificity. Libraries of frameshifting reporters provide a platform for screening putative modifiers of 610 ribosomal frameshifting, offering a powerful tool to identify ways to generally or selectively control 611 frameshifting and opening new possibilities for interfering with viral replication and for controlling 612 cellular processes depending on translational frameshifting. excluded from the design. All the variants were composed of an 18 nt forward primer, 620 12 nt barcode sequence, 162 nt variable region and 18 nt reverse primer sequences. DNA barcodes 621 were designed to differ from any other barcode in the library in at least 3 nt. 622 623 Selection of frameshifting sites for systematic sequence manipulations 624 60 PRF events reported previously or listed in FSDB (Moon et al., 2007) were included in the library 625 design. Sequences were aligned in a way that the site of frameshifting would be at the same position 626 in all variants (slippery site ending at position 42). In case there were stop codons downstream of the 627 PRF site in any of the three frames, additional versions with stop codons mutated (changed to TGG) 628 were included for testing only. Out of these, 15 were selected for systematic sequence manipulations 629 based on the amount of experimental evidence supporting them, lack of stop codons in the relevant 630 reading frames, biological significance and mechanistic diversity (i.e. covering +1, -1 and -2 631 frameshifting sites). The HIV and OAZ frameshifting sites were tested beforehand in isolation to 632 confirm that our experimental setup is able to reproduce well established cases of -1 as well as +1 633 PRF. 634 635 Design of individual rationally designed subsets 636 For each of the subsets in the libraries, systematic sequence manipulations were performed on the 637 set of 15 previously reported frameshifting sites. Design of subsets was carried out in Python. 638 Multiple barcode controls: We added multiple variants to the library that contained the same variable 639 region, but different barcodes, in order to gauge potential effects of the barcode and the technical 640 noise of our assay. 641 Slippery site: We tested all possible variations of the different slippery site patterns found in previously 642 reported frameshifting events (XXXYYYZ, XYYZZZZ, influenza, OAZ (for +1 PRF)). In the case of 643 OAZ, both the first and the second codon in the slippery site UCC UGA were replaced with all other 644 codons. In addition, we created all possible point mutations in -1 PRF slippery sites that would not 645 give rise to a stop codon. PRF slippery sites that would not give rise to a stop codon. In addition, we removed 648 up to 6 bps immediately downstream (in 1 or 3 bp increments, depending on the presence of stop 649 codons in downstream reading frames) or introduced up to 12 bps from five different constant randomly recoded five times. Moreover, variants were added for all 15 PRF events in which the same 656 part of the upstream region was replaced by four different constant sequences in increments of six 657 bps, starting from the beginning of the variable region. In addition, we included the following structural 658 variations in the design: We designed sequences 30 nt in length predicted (using ViennaRNA 2.0 659 (Lorenz et al., 2011) and antaRNA (Kleinkauf et al., 2015a, 2015b)) to fold into the respective native 660 structure (but having a different primary sequence or to have no secondary structure, a 9 bp long 661 stem-loop at the 5' or at the 3' end (6 sequences per set) and replaced the endogenous region in all 662 15 PRF events. 663 Downstream region: Variants were added for all 15 PRF events in which the same part of the 664 downstream region was replaced by three different constant sequences (different sets were used for 665 predicted +1 and -1 PRF sites to avoid stop codons in the relevant frames) in increments of six bps, 666 starting from the end of the variable region. For scanning mutagenesis, 30 positions (leaving the first 6676 bp after the slippery site unchanged) were replaced with either A or C (G and T were avoided as 668 they often give rise to stop codons in one of the frames).

The master plasmid contained the EF1alpha 704 promoter, mCherry, a designed multiple cloning site containing restriction sites for library cloning 705 (RsrII and AscI), gfp and the SV40 terminator sequence. In the case of the master plasmid for cloning 706 the stop-vector library, two complementary DNA oligonucleotides (GACTGATAGCTGACTAGTCG 707 and GTCCGACTAGTCAGCTATCAG) were synthesized (IDT), annealed and introduced into the 708 vector described above (cut with RsrII) such that the mCherry-proximal RsrII site was destroyed and 709 the downstream RsrII site (after the inserted stop cassette) was subsequently used for inserting the 710 of oligonucleotides (10 pmol). The two subsets of this pool corresponding to the designed 717 and native libraries tested here were defined by unique amplification primers. The reverse primer 718 contained a spacer of either 4 or 5 nucleotides to create the offset in the gfp reading frame. The oligo 719 pool was dissolved in 200 \u03bcl Tris-ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (Tris-EDTA) and then diluted 1:50 720with Tris-EDTA, which was used as template for PCR. We amplified each of the four libraries by721 performing 8 PCR reactions, each of which contained 19 \u03bcl of water, 5 \u03bcl of DNA, 10 \u03bcl of 5\u00d7 Herculase 722 II reaction buffer, 5 \u03bcl of 2.5 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTPs) each, 5 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM forward 723 primer, 5 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM reverse primer, and 1 \u03bcl Herculase II fusion DNA polymerase (Agilent 724 Technologies). The parameters for PCR were 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 14 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 20 s, and 68\u00b0C 725 for 1 min, each, and finally one cycle of 68\u00b0C for 4 min. The oligonucleotides were amplified using 726 library-specific common primers in the length of 35 nt, which have 18-nt complementary sequence to 727 the single-stranded 210-mers and a tail of 17 nt containing RsrII (forward primer) and AscI (reverse 728 primer) restriction sites. The PCR products were concentrated using Amicon Ultra, 0.5 ml 30K 729 centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore). The concentrated DNA was then purified using a PCR mini-elute 730 purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified library DNA (540 ng total) 731 was cut with the unique restriction enzymes RsrII and AscI (Fermentas FastDigest) for 2 hours at 732 37\u00b0C in two 40-\u03bcl reactions containing 4 \u03bcl fast digest (FD) buffer, 1 \u03bcl RsrII enzyme, 1 \u03bcl AscI enzyme, 733 18 \u03bcl DNA (15 ng/\u03bcl) and 16 \u03bcl water, followed by heat inactivation for 20 min at 65\u00b0C. Digested DNA 734 was separated from smaller fragments and uncut PCR products by electrophoresis on a 2.5% agarose 735 gel stained with GelStar (Cambrex Bio Science Rockland). Fragments were cut from the gel and 736 eluted using electroelution Midi GeBAflex tubes (GeBA, Kfar Hanagid, Israel). Eluted DNA was 737 precipitated using sodium acetate-isopropanol. The master plasmid was cut with RsrII and AscI 738 (Fermentas FastDigest) in a reaction mixture containing 6 \u03bcl FD buffer, 3 \u03bcl of each enzyme and 3.5 739 \u03bcg of the plasmid in a total volume of 60 \u03bcl. After incubation for 2.5 hours at 37\u00b0C, 3 \u03bcl FD buffer, 3 \u03bcl 740 alkaline phosphatase (Fermentas) and 24 \u03bcl water were added and the reactions were incubated for 741 an additional 30 mins at 37\u00b0C followed by 20 min at 65\u00b0C. Digested DNA was purified using a PCR 742 purification kit (Qiagen). The digested plasmid and DNA library were ligated for 30 min at room 743 temperature in a 10 \u03bcl reactions, containing 150 ng plasmid and the library in a molar ratio of 1:1, 1 744 \u03bcl CloneDirect 10\u00d7 ligation buffer, and 1 \u03bcl CloneSmart DNA ligase (Lucigen Corporation), followed 745 by heat inactivation for 15 min at 70\u00b0C. Ligated DNA was transformed into E. coli 10G 746 electrocompetent cells (Lucigen) divided into aliquots (23 \u00b5l each, plus 2 \u03bcl of the ligation mix), which 747 were then plated on 4 Luria broth (LB) agar (200 mg/ml amp) 15-cm plates per transformation reaction 748 plasmid library for each rationally designed library (frame -1 and frame +1) and 5 for each 761 native library. For each nucleofection, 4\u00d710 6 cells were centrifuged and washed twice with 20 ml of 762 Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, SIGMA). Cells were resuspended in 100 \u03bcl solution (warmed 763 to room temperature) composed of 82 \u03bcl solution V and 19 \u03bcl supplement (Amaxa\u00ae Cell Line 764 Nucleofector\u00ae Kit V). Next, the cells were mixed with 2.75 \u03bcg of donor plasmid and 0.6 \u03bcg ZFN mRNA 765 (prepared in-house) just prior to transfection. Nucleofection was carried out using program T-16 on 766 the NucleofectorTM device, immediately mixed with ~0.5 ml of pre-cultured growth medium and 767 transferred to a 6 well plate with additional 1.5 ml of pre-cultured growth medium. A purified plasmid 768 library was also transfected without the addition of ZFN and served as a control to determine when 769 cells lost non-integrated plasmids. 770 771 Sorting the library by FACS 772 K562 cells were grown for at least 14 days to ensure that non-integrated plasmid DNA was eliminated. 773 A day prior to sorting, cells were split to ~0.25\u00d7106 cells/ml. On the day of sorting, cells were 774 centrifuged, resuspended in sterile PBS and filtered using cell-strainer capped tubes (Becton 775 Dickinson (BD) Falcon). Sorting was performed with BD FACSAria II SORP (special-order research 776 product) at low sample flow rate and a sorting speed of ~18000 cells/s. To sort cells that integrated 777 the reporter construct successfully and in a single copy (~4% of the population), we determined a 778 gate according to mCherry fluorescence so that only mCherry-expressing cells corresponding to a 779 single copy of the construct were sorted (mCherry single population). We collected around 350 780 cells/variant on average for each library in order to ensure adequate library representation. combined rationally designed and native library, but separately for -1 PRF reporters, +1 783 PRF reporters and the stop-vector control) into 16 (in the case of the stop-vector 12) bins according 784 to GFP fluorescence, after gating for a narrow range of mCherry expression to avoid effects coming 785 from the influence of the variable region on overall expression level. This resulted in the loss of a 786 significant fraction of variants (as only around 50% of the cells fell into the narrow range of mCherry 787 fluorescence) but ensured that the subsequent sorting by GFP fluorescence was not biased by 788 expression level. Each bin was defined to span a range of GFP fluorescence values such that it 789 contains between 1-10% of the cell population. We collected around 1000 cells/variant on average in 790 order to ensure adequate library representation. Cells from each bin were grown separately for 791 freezing and purification of genomic DNA. 792 793 Genomic DNA purification, amplification and sample preparation 794 For each of the bins we purified genomic DNA by centrifuging 5\u00d710 6 cells, washing them with 1 ml 795 PBS and purifying DNA using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's 796 protocol. In order to maintain the complexity of the library amplified from gDNA, PCR reactions were 797 carried out on a gDNA amount calculated to contain a minimum average of 200 copies of each oligo 798 included in the sample. For each of the 16 bins, we used 15 \u00b5g of gDNA as template in a two-step 799 nested PCR.

This approach was used for each of the features sets in isolation 926 as well as all of the features combined. 927For classification, the same pipeline was used. Here, XGBClassifier was trained and the performance 928 scored on the test set, reporting the area under the ROC curve as a metric. 929Feature importance and effect on the model was determined using SHAP analysis (Lundberg et al.generated in this study are available in the NCBI gene expression omnibus (GEO",

At the first codon position, UUU was the only codon leading to +1 PRF signal 276 similar to wild-type (Fig 2F, left), maybe due to the creation of a stretch of four Us and thereby 277 facilitating re-pairing of the tRNA in the +1 frame. Indeed, UUU is the second most widely used codon 278 found in that position in the OAZ frameshifting site in other species, e.g. certain funghi and nematodes 279 (Ivanov and Atkins, 2007). Some reported -1 PRF sites deviate from the canonical slippery site pattern (XXXYYYZ). To test the 281 ability of the alternative patterns to induce frameshifting across sequence contexts we replaced the 282 slippery site in a set of PRF events with all combinations of nucleotides following the pattern found in 283 west nile virus (XYYZZZZ, Fig 2G; Melian et al., 2014; Moomau et al., 2016). In general, the ability of 284alternative slippery site patterns to cause frameshifting was limited to their native sequence contexts. 285",
