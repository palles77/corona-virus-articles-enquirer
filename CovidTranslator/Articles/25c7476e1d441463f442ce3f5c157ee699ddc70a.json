Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a receptor of 2019-nCoV spike 1 protein (S1) and mediates viral entry into host cells. Despite the abundance of ACE2 in small intestine, few digestive symptoms are observed in patients infected by 2019-nCoV. Herein, we investigated the interactions between ACE2 and human defensins (HDs) specifically secreted by intestinal Paneth cells. The lectin-like HD5, rather than HD6, bound ACE2 with a high affinity of 39.3 nM and weakened the subsequent recruitment of 2019-nCoV S1. The author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. : bioRxiv preprint cloak of HD5 on the ligand-binding domain of ACE2 was confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation. A remarkable dose-dependent preventive effect of HD5 on 2019-nCoV S1 binding to intestinal epithelial cells was further evidenced by in vitro experiments. Our findings unmasked the innate defense function of lectin-like intestinal defensin against 2019-nCoV, which may provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.",

S protein is composed of 1160-1400 amino acids and presents as a trimer before membrane fusion 6 . Many S proteins can be divided into S1 and S2 subunits after degradation by protease 7 . The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and devotes to the initial viral attachment via recognizing a variety of host cell receptors, including aminopeptidase N (APN), angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), and sugar 8, 9, 10 . Since the sequence of 2019-nCoV S protein is 76.47% homology to that of SARS-CoV 11 , ACE2, which is identified as the crucial target for SARS-CoV, was also considered the host receptor of 2019-nCoV 12 . In fact, it was reported that host cells expressed ACE2, instead of APN and DPP4, were sensitive to 2019-nCoV 13, 14 . In vitro binding assay demonstrated that ACE2 enabled a potent interaction with 2019-nCoV S protein with an affinity of 14.7 nM 15 , which is 10-to 20-fold higher than that of ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S protein.",

The binding affinity of HD5 was much higher than that of a hexapeptide inhibitor, 438 YKYRYL 443 , derived from the RBD of SARS-CoV spike protein (46 \u03bcM) 27 . We previously discovered that HD5 is reduced to linear peptide, HD5 RED , under the catalysis of thioredoxin system in vivo 28, 29 . Interestingly, BLI revealed that similar to HD6, HD5 RED failed to bind ACE2 ( Figure 1C ). The structure-dependent interaction of HD5 with ACE2 is consistent with that cysteine replacement impairs the bactericidal and immunoregulatory efficiencies of HD5 30,31 , which expands the known roles of disulfide pairings in keeping the conformation of defensins.",

We reversely loaded S1 and measured the recruitment of ACE2. As shown in Figure S1 , the binding thickness was low, whereas the affinity (3.8 nM) was comparable to that of S1 binding to ACE2.

After 20 ns of simulation, the complex conformation kept stable with residue fluctuations smaller than 0.11 nm in five trajectories relative to the starting coordinates ( Figure S2A ). HD5 formed many potent H-bonds with ACE2, which average number is 5-6 and the max number is 12 in an average To validate the inhibitive effect of HD5 on 2019-nCoV S1 binding to ACE2, we further conducted a cell experiment, in which human intestinal epithelium Caco-2 cells were exposed to 8 \u00b5g/mL of 2019-nCoV S1. Confocal microscopy observed that S1 largely adhered to the cell surface in the absence of HD5 (Figure 4 , Figure S3 ). Nevertheless, when cells were author/funder. All rights reserved.

Notably, the protection of HD5 was in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5C ). As shown in Figure 5D , HD5 could significantly decrease S1 binding to epithelial cells at concentrations as low as 10 \u00b5g/mL, which is within the range of HD5 concentration in intestine 22 . The protective effect of HD5 was also observed for human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells abundant in ACE2 ( Figure   S4 ) 16, 17 . However, S1 pretreated with HD5 was still efficient to contact Caco-2, as revealed by either immunoblotting or immunofluorescence. These data are in line with the results shown in Figure 1E and 2B, demonstrating that HD5 inhibits 2019-nCoV S1 adhering to host cells possibly by blocking ACE2 but not S1.

S1 and ACE2 were loaded on HIS1K and AR2G biosensors, respectively, at a concentration of 15 \u03bcg/mL. The immobilized ACE2 was incubated with 200 and 50 nM HD5 for 300 s at 30 o C. After a 300 s of disassociation, the signals of 400 nM S1 binding to ACE2 were recorded for another 300 s. Otherwise, the immobilized S1 was covered with 100 nM HD5 for 300 s. The bindings of 100 nM ACE2 to S1 were recorded for 300 s after peptide disassociation. 44 ) and the LBD of ACE2 (PDB: 6ACG 45 ) was performed on ZDOCK server 46 . The Gromacs 2020 software package 47 , AMBER99SB-ILDN force field, and TIP3P water model were applied for the simulation with a time step of 2 fs. Firstly, 1000-step minimization was carried out. Then, for fully relaxation, four 1-ns pre-equilibration simulation with restrained coordinates of the atoms belonging to the heavy atoms, main chain, backbone, and C-\u03b1, respectively, were performed step by step.

Recently, a novel pathogenic virus named novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged worldwide 1 , bringing about a pneumonia epidemic due to human-to-human transmission 2 . The clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV-infected patients are similar to those of patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) rife in 2003 and 2012, respectively 3,4 . Respiratory failure, septicopyemia, cardiac failure, hemorrhage, and kidney failure are the primary causes leading to the death of patients infected by 2019-nCoV 5 .",

Additionally, three electrostatic interactions (HD5-Arg 6 ~ ACE2-Glu 23 , HD5-Glu 21 ~ ACE2-Lys 31 , HD5-Glu 21 ~ ACE2-His 34 ) and three hydrophobic interactions (HD5-Ala 1 ~ ACE2-Leu 79 , HD5-Tyr 4 ~ ACE2-Phe 28 , HD5-Tyr 4 ~ ACE2-Leu 79 ) took part in the interface stabilization (Figure 3A), resulting in a net free binding energy of -1866.53 kJ/mol. Driven by the potent intermolecular interaction, HD5 tightly attached the surface of ACE2 LBD (Figure 3B) and cloaked Thr 7 , Gln 24 , Asp 30 , and Lys 31 on \u03b1-helix 1 and Tyr 83 on loop 2 (Figure 3C). The exposure of Met 82 was partially shielded. Among the blocking sites, Asp 30 , Lys 31 , and Met 82 might be more important than the others, as mutations of Asp 30 and Lys 31 caused a marked loss of interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV S1 37 , and Met 82 mutations in rat and mouse lowered the entry of SARS-CoV 38 . Considering the sequence difference between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV 11 , further research is required for investigating whether these sites are critical determinants for 2019-nCoV binding to ACE2.",

            "text": "Collectively, we found for the first time that lectin-like intestinal defensin can protect host cells against 2019-nCoV entry. Paneth cell-secreted HD5 efficiently bound and blocked ACE2 which locates on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells, lowering the recruitment of 2019-nCoV S1 (Figure 6). It is an interesting explanation to the clinical phenomenon that few intestinal symptoms are observed in patients infected by 2019-nCoV19 . Due to the immature Paneth cells and deficiency in HD539 , it is might also be a potential reason for the infection of a newborn 30 h after birth40 . Similarly, adult patients receiving small intestine transplantation or suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases such as the Crohn's disease, whose HD5 content are deficient in vivo41,42 , might be more susceptible to 2019-nCoV than the healthy.More importantly, as there is a shortage of effective drugs to prevent and treat 2019-nCoV infection, we think that it may be a useful strategy to increase the content of HD5 in vivo by immunoregulation or exogenous supplement of HD5 as we recently described43 .MethodsPeptide synthesis.
