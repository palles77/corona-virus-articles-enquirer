Barracudas are attracted by shining objects, such as rings and bracelets on hands dangled in the water and may leap out of the water in pursuit of a fish that is being pulled in on an angler's line.",

Attacks are unusual but the eels' multiple rows of long, fang-like, backward-pointing teeth may cause deep puncture wounds with avulsion of tissue if the animal is forcefully removed (Fig. 134.3 .3). Despite much speculation, they have no venom apparatus but a major threat is infection of the bite wounds with a variety of marine Vibrio, Aeromonas and Pseudomonas spp. [7] . (Fig. 134.3.4A ,B)",

Bites may be \"slashing\" in type, in which the anterior maxillary teeth strike and can envenom but do not engage, and \"gripping\", when the animal clings on and chews for up to 15 minutes before it can be removed [6] . Not all bites result in envenoming. [6] [7] [8] [9] Envenoming by H. suspectum and H. horridum causes identical clinical syndromes. Pain may start immediately and is described as throbbing or burning. It may radiate up the bitten limb to the shoulder, chest and epigastrium, and is often excruciating in intensity, persisting for 24 hours or more. Swelling also develops rapidly, extending, in some cases, to involve the whole limb, but although it may be tense, compartment syndrome has never been described. The bite site is erythematous or cyanosed with traumatic ecchymoses and persistent bleeding, but tissue necrosis does not develop. Red lymphangitic lines extend up the limb and regional lymph glands may become tender and enlarged. Local paresthesia, hyperesthesia and even paralysis have been described. The earliest systemic symptoms start within five minutes of the bite: dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, profuse generalized sweating, breathlessness and weakness. Hypotension and tachycardia are commonly recorded. These symptoms may be transient or recurrent. Less commonly, there is angioedema (swelling of lips, tongue, throat and upper airway) [10] , increased secretions, chills, fever and tinnitus.",

Scientific and common English names are given. [2] Snake bite is an important medical emergency in some parts of the rural tropics but its incidence is usually underestimated because most victims seek the help of traditional healers rather than practitioners of Western-style medicine. EPIDEMIOLOGY [3] Most snake bites are inflicted on the lower limbs of farmers, plantation workers, herdsmen and hunters in rural areas of tropical developing countries. The incidence of bites by a particular species in a particular geographic area depends on the densities of human and snake populations, the snake's irritability (its inclination to bite when trodden on or disturbed) and diurnal rhythm, and the extent to which human activities encroach on its chosen habitat. The snake is usually trodden on at night or in undergrowth. Some species, such as the Asian kraits (Bungarus spp.) and African spitting cobras (Naja nigricollis, Naja mossambica, etc.), enter human dwellings at night and may bite people who roll over onto them while sleeping on the floor. Snakes do not bite without provocation, but may strike if inadvertently trodden upon or touched. In Europe, North America, and Australia, exotic snakes are increasingly popular pets. In these countries, bites are inflicted on the hands of (usually) males who are picking up their pets, often late at night while drunk. In the USA, 25% of bites result from snakes being attacked or handled. Serious bites by backfanged (colubrid) snakes usually occur only under these circumstances. Seasonal peaks in the incidence of snake bite are associated with agricultural activities, such as ploughing before the annual rains in the West African Sahel and the rice harvest in Southeast Asia, or to fluctuations in the activity or population of venomous snakes. Severe flooding, by concentrating the human and snake populations, has Table 134 .5.2 and reference [11] )",

The high proportion of bites without envenoming (\"dry bites\") reported for species such as Calloselasma rhodostoma (>50%) or Pseudonaja spp. (>80%) is more likely to reflect mechanical inefficiency than to voluntary control by the snake, and the concept of a defensive bite may not be valid.

Thus, patients who are bitten, but not envenomed, may feel flushed and breathless, with constriction of the chest, and a thumping pulse, palpitations, sweating and effects of hyperventilation, such as faintness, acroparesthesia and even tetany, may be noticed. Such symptoms dominate many accounts of snake bites written by the victims and are falsely attributed to neurotoxicity. Misguided traditional prehospital treatments can result in swelling and ischemia of limbs whose circulation is occluded by tourniquets, bleeding or sensory loss resulting from local incisions, vomiting and other side effects caused by ingested herbal remedies, smarting eyes and conjunctivitis from instillation of plant juices, and bronchospasm from insufflation of oils.

In practice, the entire bitten limb is bound firmly, using a 10-cm wide elasticated bandage, starting at the toes or fingers and finishing at the groin or axilla. A splint is incorporated to aid immobilization. Anecdotal experience supports the use of the method but it has proved difficult to train people to apply it correctly. However, it is the only known method for delaying the onset of potentially fatal respiratory paralysis after a neurotoxic elapid bite before the patient reaches medical care without incurring the dangers of a tight arterial tourniquet. If the necessary skills and equipment are available immediately, pressure-immobilization (P-I) should be applied, unless it is possible to eliminate the possibility of a neurotoxic elapid bite (e.g. by confident identification of the snake or exclusion on geographical grounds).

Some antivenoms raised against the venom of one or two species have paraspecific activity against venoms of related species.

            "text": "The medical importance of bats (Order Chiroptera) to human health is increasingly recognized. They are proven, or potential, reservoirs of zoonotic human pathogens and vectors. Transmission may be direct, by bat bites, scratches or more subtle contact; or indirect by infecting other mammalian hosts or by creating in their accumulated feces (bat guano)-a culture medium for pathogenic fungi whose spores may be inhaled by people entering bat caves. Bats may damage fruit crops, and cattle and other domestic animals are vulnerable to battransmitted infections. In Latin America, vampire bat-transmitted bovine rabies (\"derriengue\") and trypanosomiasis (Trypanosoma evansi infection causing \"surra\") threatens meat production. Nipah virus causes fatal disease in pigs in Southeast Asia where epidemics have led to the culling of more than 1 million of these animals. Hendra, Menangle and Tioman viruses have been responsible for fatal diseases in horses and pigs in Australia and Malaysia. However, bats are much less important, medically and economically, than rodents. Rats, mice and voles are vectors and reservoirs of many prevalent zoonotic pathogens, such as Hanta-and Arena-viruses, plague bacillus, leptospires, rickettsiae and parastrongyloids. Rodents also consume crops and food stores and damage human dwellings and installations. In their favor, bats are fascinating and beautiful animals which are protected and conserved in many Western countries and which benefit the environment by controlling insects, pollinating fruit trees and distributing seeds. Bats are eaten medicinally in China and elsewhere and as a delicacy and valuable source of protein in West Africa, Southeast Asia, Indonesia, New Guinea and Australia (by native Australians). Catching and butchering bats and consuming inadequately cooked bats incurs the risk of infection.",

Since the late 14th century, European explorers of the Caribbean and South America reported the association between vampire bat attacks and fatal human illness. Ecologic changes, such as destruction of forest and introduction of cattle ranching, construction of trans-Amazonian highways, the invasion of newlyaccessible jungle by gold miners and electric power failures, have led to small epidemics of human rabies transmitted by vampires. These have accounted for more than 500 deaths since 1975, usually affecting rural communities of indigenous Amerindians, such as the Warao in north-east Venezuela. There have been recent outbreaks in Colombia (Choc\u00f3, Santander), Peru (Condorcanqui, Bagna, Puerto Maldanado, Ayacucho), Brazil (Para, Maranh\u00e3o) and Venezuela (Delta Amacuro). Humans are bitten at night on their extremities, ears and faces. Children appear particularly vulnerable. They may not wake up but discover bleeding wounds showing a double puncture made by the incisors (Fig. 134.6 .12) or a depressed lesion with raised edge (Figs 134.6.13 and 134.6.14) in the morning. Mosquito nets are normally protective but accessible body parts may be attacked and the vampire's melena stool may be found staining the net (Fig. 134.6.15 ). Historical epidemics of vampire bat rabies, such as occurred in Trinidad from 1929, were characterized by predominantly paralytic disease, but a minority of patients develop hydrophobia and other features of furious rabies. Vampire bat-related strains of classic Genotype 1 rabies virus have been found in many South American wild and domestic mammals and have been transmitted to humans, for example by pet marmosets in Brazil.",

[6] People, especially children, living in areas where vampire bat bites are common should, ideally, be protected by rabies pre-exposure immunization, but this is rarely practicable. However, the high risk of fatal rabies in affected communities (e.g. 16 of 57 people bitten by vampires in one village in north-east Brazil) reflects the inaccessibility of post-exposure prophylaxis. Bat proofing of dwellings and sleeping under mosquito nets affords some protection and electric house lighting may deter vampires. Vampires are highly susceptible to anticoagulants, such as warfarin, which can be distributed to vampire colonies by capturing the bats and releasing them after plastering them with warfarin paste. Treatment of cattle with controlled doses of warfarin will kill vampires feeding on them. Cattle can be vaccinated using adjuvanted Pasteur Virus strain (PV) vaccine and vampires themselves with recombinant vaccinia-vaccine.",

Fifteen were associated with Lasionycteris noctivagans or Pipistrellus subflavus, 11 with Tadarida brasiliensis, and 1 each with Myotis spp. and Eptesicus fuscus. However, there was a clear history of a bat bite in only a few of these cases, although some had been in direct contact with bats and others had bats in their homes. This suggests the possibility of subtle contact such as the bat's licking an open wound or intact mucous membranes of a sleeping person [7, 8] . Bat strains of Genotype 1 appear more tolerant of low temperatures and are more able to replicate in endothelial cells than canine strains of Genotype 1. The survival of three American children from bat-transmitted rabies may also suggest decreased virulence of bat strains. Aerosol transmission of rabies was claimed to explain infection of two visitors to Frio Caves in Texas inhabited by 20-30 million T. brasilensis, but it is far more likely that they were infected transdermally.",

Even the handling of a dead bat has been associated with transmission. Grounded, trapped or sick bats should, ideally, be handled only by experts and never without gloves.

In the Benue Valley of north-east Nigeria, Echis ocellatus causes some 500 bites per 100,000 population per year, with a 12% mortality. Recently, a study of snake bite mortality in India, based on verbal autopsy, estimated 46,000 deaths each year. In Burma, Russell's viper bite is a common cause of acute kidney injury and is responsible for most of the estimated 1000 snake-bite deaths each year. In the USA, there are about 45,000 bites and a few deaths each year. Rattlesnakes, especially (Crotalus adamanteus, Crotalus atrox, Crotalus horridus, Crotalus oreganus, Crotalus scutulatus, Crotalus viridis and Sistrurus miliaris), are the most dangerous species. In Britain, the adder or viper (Vipera berus) is the only venomous species, biting more than 200 people each year. Only 14 deaths have been reported since 1876-the last in 1975. This species is important in Scandinavian countries. Vipera aspis causes most bites in France, while Vipera ammodytes is important in eastern Europe.Some hunter-gatherer tribes, such as the Yanomamo of Venezuela, the Waorani of Ecuador, the Kaxinawa of Brazil, the Hadza of Tanzania and some tribal groups in Papua New Guinea, suffer high mortality from snake bites. Global estimates of annual snake bite mortality vary from 20,000 to 125,000. Many survivors are left with permanent physical disability.",
