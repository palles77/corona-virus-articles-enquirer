However, most studies rely on the clinical presentation of the illness to initiate diagnostic procedures [1] . Unrecognized asymptomatic infections are likely to form important links in transmission of respiratory viruses in the community. Few community studies have attempted diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection irrespective of symptoms [2] [3] [4] . Consequently, estimates of the proportion of RSV infections that are without symptoms are limited, and their contribution to transmission patterns at the community level has not been characterized. This may be especially important in older children and adults, in whom virus shedding (both amount and duration) is less than for younger individuals [5, 6] . These issues find focus in this article.",

This involves collecting samples at intervals of the order of the infection generation time (ie, days for most respiratory viruses), regardless of illness status, and using highly sensitive diagnostic procedures. Additionally, the procedures must be acceptable to the local population, to maintain compliance over a sufficient period of study. The current work analyses data from a study conducted in rural coastal Kenya that conformed to these requirements. The primary objective was to identify who infects whom and, in particular, who infects young infants in rural households [7] . The current analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic RSV infections, identify predictors of asymptomatic episodes, and assess the role of asymptomatic cases in the spread of RSV in households.",

A household was defined as a group of individuals living in the same compound and with communal cooking arrangements. The RSV season was identified from surveillance conducted by the local county hospital and was defined as a period in which at least 2 RSV cases were detected per week in each of the 2 contiguous weeks and continued as long as these conditions were met [9] . During every home visit, trained field assistants recorded the presence of respiratory symptoms (ie, cough, runny or blocked nose, or difficulty in breathing). The presence of 1 or more of these symptoms defined acute respiratory disease (ARD). Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected and screened for RSV (groups A and B), human rhinovirus (hRV), human coronavirus (hCoV-OC43, NL63, and 229E), and adenovirus (AdV), using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [10] . For each test target, a cycle threshold (Ct) value of \u226435 was considered positive for virus [11] .",

Episodes whose first sample was positive for both RSV group A and B counted as 1 infection episode and were assigned to either RSV group in the final analysis, depending on the RSV group with the higher peak viral load or longer virus shedding duration. An asymptomatic case was defined as the absence of any ARD symptoms in the course of the RSV infection episode. The timing of the start of symptoms was defined for every episode. The first person(s) in the household to acquire RSV infection, based on the date of sample collection, was referred to as the index case(s). A household RSV outbreak was identified when at least 1 other infection occurred during or within 14 days from the end of the infection episode of an index case in the same household. The outbreaks were confirmed to be of the same strain by comparing partial G gene sequences of the selected virus-positive specimens in the household [7] . The prevalence of asymptomatic RSV episodes was estimated and stratified by a number of characteristics, including age, infecting RSV group, sex, minimum Ct value during the episode, detection of other respiratory viruses before and during the episode, and presence of concurrent RSV infection in the same household. The minimum Ct value over the RSV episode was used as a proxy measure for the peak viral load, on the assumption that Ct values are inversely proportional to the quantity of specific viral nucleic acid in the sample [12] .",

The missed sampling was mainly due to refusal of swabbing or when the individuals were away during home visits, as previously reported [5, 7] . Of the 483 individuals with at least 1 sample collected, the median number of nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected was 41 (IQR, 30-44).",

            "text": "We report the prevalence of asymptomatic RSV infections from a study following 47 households with 493 individuals over the 26 weeks of an RSV epidemic. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected twice weekly regardless of symptoms and screened for a range of respiratory viruses, including RSV. Over 40% of the 205 RSV infection episodes were asymptomatic. The probability of symptomless RSV infection increased with age, peaking at about 40 years, and declined in older ages (Supplementary Figure 2 ). This accords with published observations that the risk of severe disease from RSV infection decreases with age [14] [15] [16] [17] and increases in elderly individuals [18] . Evidence from experimental challenge and epidemiological studies also support these observations and provide possible mechanisms [9, 16, 19, 20 ]. An experimental study using RSV A2 strain in young adult volunteers, together with infection being determined by virus isolation, reported a greater risk of infection in individuals administered a high RSV inoculum, compared with those administered a low dose (57% vs 36%), with asymptomatic infections occurring in 63% and 40% of the infections, respectively [19] ; individuals who were infected had statistically lower serum neutralizing antibody titers than uninfected individuals. In another experimental infection study involving 13 adult volunteers, with low neutralizing antibody titers, 12 had detectable viral shedding and respiratory illness when administered a high dose of RSV A2 inoculum [19] . Even though these experiments used a prototype virus, rather than the wild-type virus as in the current study, their findings suggest that acquired immunity against RSV and physiological development of the airways could play an important role in reducing the severity of RSV-associated respiratory disease. Serological studies show that antibody produced during RSV infection in young children and elderly individuals is ineffective and associated with an inappropriate cytokine response and excess inflammation of the airways [21] , partly explaining the increased disease severity in these age groups. RSV has been identified as an important pathogen in older ages [22] . In a US family study by Hall et al that used a similar intensive specimen collection regimen but detection by virus culture [2] , the prevalence of asymptomatic infection was low in families exposed to RSV, which could be due to exposure to large inoculum from close contacts within the household. Only 5% of infected individuals (2 of 39) had asymptomatic infection in the US study. In a study of infants admitted with RSV to intensive shedding in a household cohort study in Kenya, by clinical and household transmission status. Acute respiratory disease (ARD) presence is denoted by red, ARD absence is denoted by blue, and cases linked with virus spread are denoted by green. Data are mean values (95% confidence intervals). P values were calculated by 2-sided t tests comparing the mean values in index cases linked with spread, stratified by clinical status. Abbreviation: AU, arbitrary units. care units, Crowcroft et al reported a prevalence of asymptomatic infection, as determined by PCR of pernasal swabs, of 48% and 49% in the siblings and parents, respectively [23] . This suggests that the study by Hall et al [2] might have missed subclinical infections, particularly in older children and adults, owing to reduced sensitivity of the viral culture in asymptomatic cases. Alternatively, it is possible that in the present study, virus shed from asymptomatic cases was not viable, resulting in an overestimation of subclinical infections. We show that infection episodes with low peak viral load or absence of concurrent RSV infections in the household were associated with a reduced risk of ARD. In general, it appears that asymptomatic RSV infections are likely in individuals with previous exposure to RSV (and with concomitant high levels of neutralizing antibodies), such as older children and young adults [19] .",

We found that group B RSV infections were associated with higher risk of asymptomatic infection than group A infections. This association had a stronger statistical significance when we excluded the atypical household (Supplementary Table 3 ). The consistency of this finding with results from published studies [25, 26] supports the hypothesis that group B RSV infections are less severe than group A RSV infections in the community. Walsh et al observed that hospitalized infants without underlying medical conditions who were infected with RSV group B rarely required respiratory support, compared with those infected with group A (1% vs 12%) [25] . The individual attack rates for groups A and B were similar (48.0% and 56.4%, respectively), and the preceding epidemic was predominated by group A (Nokes et al, unpublished data) . This precludes that any differential effect of infection severity was due to dominance of one group in the community. However, other studies have reported conflicting results on the relationship of RSV groups to disease severity [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Most of these are hospital studies that used less sensitive virus detection methods (ie, viral culture and immunofluorescence techniques) or collected specimens upon report of respiratory illness.",

In the current study, hRV infection <14 days before the start of RSV infection was associated with a reduced risk of asymptomatic infection. However, no significant association was observed between the presence of other respiratory viruses (AdV and hCoV) before or during the RSV episode and the risk of symptomless RSV infection. This association between RSV and hRV infections is more likely to be mediated through nonspecific cross-reactivity of innate immunity, such as the physiological status of respiratory epithelia following virus infection. Additional investigation is required to explore these effects.",

We observed a strong positive correlation between the markers of RSV shedding (ie, duration and viral load) over the infection period ( Figure 4 ) and the probability of spread. Longer RSV infection episodes or those with a higher peak viral load were more likely to be symptomatic than their counterparts. The presence of symptoms and correlates of the amount of virus shedding (ie, duration and load) were independently associated with the risk of within-household spread among the index cases, after adjustment for age and household size. These findings taken together indicate that symptomatic individuals were more infectious and, thus, better transmitters than those without symptoms. The correlation of ARD and the amount of virus shedding suggests that vaccines that decrease viral shedding severity upon exposure to RSV, even if they do not reduce the risk of infection itself, could diminish virus transmission in the population. However, 34% of the symptomatic RSV episodes had the illness appear on average 4 days after first detection of the virus. If individuals change their behavior as a result of symptoms, such as by reducing their contacts, the period of shedding before symptoms appear or the prevalence of asymptomatic infections might have an accentuated role in transmission of RSV in the population. Furthermore, the high frequency of asymptomatic RSV cases observed in this study, coupled with the nonnegligible infectivity of the asymptomatic state, suggests that these individuals could play an important role in the transmission of RSV in a population.",

The detection of RNA does not necessarily correlate with the presence of infectious virus. In the future, the Ct value associated with the potential to infect must be established, and assessment of the viability (infectiousness) of the viruses detected in asymptomatic infections is warranted. However, one fourth of the index cases linked with household spread were without symptoms in the current study. Despite the intensive sampling regimen, RSV infections with low viral load or short duration of shedding (<3 days), especially the asymptomatic cases, might have been missed. Our estimate of the prevalence of asymptomatic infections might be an underestimate, even though use of sensitive PCR screening methods might have diminished the detection bias.",

We provide empirical data that will be useful in developing a realistic RSV transmission model for assessing the impact of RSV vaccines and other interventions on viral circulation.",
