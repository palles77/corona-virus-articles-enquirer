We also know that evolutionary change is more easily selected for in a large population than in a small one. On page 658 of this issue, Antia et al. 1 combine these facts to reach a previously unappreciated conclusion about emerging infectious diseases: some types of infectious parasites that attack the human population may pose a serious threat even if they are not initially able to cause epidemics.The reason is that certain parasites are specially poised to evolve so that they can cause epidemics.",

This is the average number of new infections caused by the first infected individual in the population. The epidemic threshold is R 0 \u01c31, above which the disease spreads (neglecting random effects) and below which it eventually dies out. R 0 is not, however, a measure of virulence or of the harm inflicted on the host by infection. In humans, for example, R 0 is virtually zero for some diseases with a high mortality rate (such as rabies, and hantavirus respiratory infections); but R 0 is well above unity for other diseases that also have high mortality rates (such as measles in undernourished populations,AIDS and smallpox).",

An obvious reason for this is that it takes less change to achieve an R 0 of more than one if the initial R 0 is just below one. A less obvious reason -and the focus of Antia and colleagues' paper -is that the length of time a parasite persists in the population before disappearing increases with R 0 ; parasites with R 0 nearly at unity can persist for a considerable time by chance. The longer the parasite persists,the greater will be its opportunity to evolve to a higher R 0 . This is merely a population size effect: each additional host infected before the parasite dies out provides yet another opportunity for a mutation that might push R 0 over the epidemic threshold.",

R 0 encapsulates the long chain of events involved in the parasite's association with its host -its first contact, entry, growth in the initial tissue infected, infection of secondary tissues, and so on, until the final stage of its dissemination to make contact with other hosts. A mutation that increases R 0 may arise at any stage in this chain, provided that it ultimately leads to an increase in the number of infections.For instance,an increase in R 0 may evolve through changes in surface molecules that improve parasite infection of new hosts directly, or it may evolve through improved growth within the host (possibly increasing virulence) so that more parasite progeny are disseminated from the host, resulting in higher numbers of secondary infections.",

However, a parasite could also begin its foray into humans by being fairly infectious but poor at surviving the onslaught of our immune system (as seems to have been the case with the Ebola virus that, in 1989, destroyed an imported Philippine monkey colony in Reston, Virginia 3 ). Mutations that increase R 0 might then improve within-human growth. This type of emerging pathogen is the most easily missed and potentially the most dangerous. Efforts to understand the relationship between parasite adaptation to hosts, virulence and transmission have developed into a small industry in evolutionary biology. The relationship is complicated because it involves group versus individual selection, population bottlenecks and trade-offs 4,5 .",

Quantifying the likely threat of emerging diseases isn't easy, but evolution is a crucial factor that may tip the balance in favour of such human parasites. easy to achieve: the light frequency should be tuned close to the resonant frequency of the atoms, and then the group velocity may be slowed by a factor of a thousand or more.The bad news is that minimum pulse velocity also means maximum absorption of the light by the material: the pulses move very slowly, but they are so strongly absorbed that they penetrate only a few wavelengths' distance through the material.",

We now have 'phase-coherent' materials, which give the huge dispersion associated with resonance but do not absorb light. These materials are truly a new state of matter, aptly called 'phaseonium' , and their electromagnetically induced transparency 8 has proved useful in slowing light down to just a few metres per second. It has been shown 9,10 that the quantum state of a light beam can be stored in phaseonium vapour and then retrieved by a later pulse of light. This works because in slow-light propagation, part of the light beam is converted into atomic excitation (that is, it is mapped onto atomic spins). This transfer of the information contained in the light's quantum state onto the atoms (writing), together with its subsequent retrieval (reading), is a vital tool in the emerging field of quantum information, including cryptography and computing. However, although the concept of storing light by 'drawing' its quantum blueprint in the atomic medium is interesting, this is not the same as freezing light.",

For example, my own group is investigating the passage of slow-light pulses through a moving phase-coherent medium, such that the pulse would appear stationary to a fixed camera in the laboratory 11 . The route chosen by Bajcsy et al. 1 , following the theoretical outline of ref. 12, does not involve a moving medium. Instead, a light pulse is trapped inside a gaseous, phase-coherent medium by changing the optical properties of the medium. There are two steps to the process: first, two laser pulses, the 'control' and 'signal'fields, are injected into a medium in which all the atoms are in the lowest-energy, ground state; then, with both control and signal fields in the medium, the control pulse is turned off. This results in the atoms' absorbing the signal field and storing the quantum state of the signal. Following the example of previous work, the next step news and views 610 NATURE | VOL 426 | 11 DECEMBER 2003 | www.nature.com/nature may act as stepping stones to foster evolution of new pathogens capable of attacking people with healthy immune systems 7 .

Furthermore, the result draws attention to the neglected topic of parasite dynamics in the pre-epidemic stages.This was brought into focus earlier this year when it was realized that the initial spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; Fig. 1 ) depended heavily on the social connectivity of the first (index) case in a community.

The landmark slow-light experiment 6 -down to a speed of just 17 metres per second -was carried out in an ultracold gas. The advantage of such low temperatures is that they eliminate the spread in atomic frequencies that is caused by atomic motion: this optical Doppler effect could otherwise obscure, even spoil, the measurements of slow light. It is not necessary, however, to use trapped ultracold atoms and get rid of the Doppler effect to slow light down: this has been proved by the slowing of light to less than 100 metres per second in a hot gas of rubidium atoms 7 .",

Atoms and molecules tend to interact with light more strongly at certain frequencies, and this is manifest in a variation of the material's index of refraction, which causes different waves to move with different velocities.Of course,this affects the group velocity of the pulse -and is the reason that light is dispersed by a prism or water droplets to make a rainbow.",
