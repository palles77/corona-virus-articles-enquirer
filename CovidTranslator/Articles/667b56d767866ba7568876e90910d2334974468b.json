We read the publication on \"Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control\" with a great interest. Li et al. studied vicarious traumatization scores and concluded that \"Early strategies that aim to prevent and treat vicarious traumatization in medical staff and general public are extremely necessary (Li et al., 2020) .\" The reliability of mobile app-based questionnaire might be a weak point as it is unable to identify those who did not respond to the questionnaire. In addition, traumatization scoring might lack sufficient details for a proper plan for corrective actions. Nevertheless, we appreciate the effort to address the problem.",

Such aggressive attitude toward doctors and other medical staff is not a generic problem with Thailand healthcare; it seems to be a specific problem with coronavirus outbreak, because local people also have high levels of stress, because of the crisis situation.
