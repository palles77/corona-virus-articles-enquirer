            "text": "Lentiviral vectors are increasingly used in clinical trials to treat genetic diseases. Our research has focused on strategies to improve lentiviral gene transfer efficiency in the airways. Previously we demonstrated that a feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-based lentiviral vector pseudotyped with the baculovirus envelope glycoprotein GP64 (GP64-FIV) efficiently transduced mouse nasal epithelia in vivo but transduced mouse intrapulmonary airways with 10-fold less efficiency. Here, we demonstrate that members of a family of proteins with antiviral activity, interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), are more highly expressed in mouse intrapulmonary airways as compared with mouse nasal airways. Using GP64-and VSV-G (vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein)-pseudotyped FIV, we show that expression of mouse IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 restricts gene transfer. Further, we show that both the nasal and intrapulmonary airways of IFITM locus knockout mice are more efficiently transduced with GP64-FIV than their heterozygous littermates. In anticipation of transitioning our studies into pig models of airway disease and clinical trials in humans, we investigated the ability of pig and human IFITMs to restrict lentiviral gene transfer. We observed that both human and pig IFITMs partially restricted both VSV-G-FIV and GP64-FIV transduction in vitro. Previous studies have focused on IFITM-mediated restriction of replication-competent wild-type viruses; however, these results implicate the IFITM proteins as restriction factors that can limit lentivirus-based vector gene transfer to airway epithelia. The findings are relevant to future preclinical and clinical airway gene therapy trials using lentivirus-based vectors.",

            "text": "CURRENT LENTIVIRAL VECTOR TECHNOLOGY has progressed considerably toward the goal of creating a vehicle with the ability to efficiently, safely, and persistently express a transgene in the appropriate cell types. 1, 2 Several features of lentiviral vectors make them attractive vehicles for delivering therapeutic genes, including their large transgenepackaging capacity, efficient gene transfer capabilities, persistent expression, the capacity to transduce mitotically quiescent cells, and lack of virus-encoded proteins that could elicit undesirable immune responses. [3] [4] [5] For our studies, we developed gene transfer vectors derived from a nonprimate lentivirus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). 6, 7 Tissue and cellular tropism of lentiviral vectors can be modified by substituting the envelope glycoprotein with other glycoproteins from many different viruses. We previously demonstrated that FIV pseudotyped with the envelope glycoprotein from baculovirus Autographa californica multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrosis virus (GP64) confers apical entry into well-differentiated primary cultures of human, mouse, and pig airway epithelial cells. 4, [8] [9] [10] We further demonstrated that GP64-FIV efficiently transduced the airways of mice or pigs in vivo, was repeatedly administered without the generation of blocking immune responses, and expressed a reporter gene for the life span of mice. 9, 11 Thus, GP64-FIV is a candidate gene therapy reagent for genetic pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",

            "text": "Multiple host factors have been identified that limit lentiviral gene transfer efficiency. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] The interferon-induced transmembrane family of proteins (IFITMs) are robustly stimulated by both type I and type II interferons. 17 IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 are all expressed ubiquitously, whereas IFITM5 expression is unique to osteoblasts. 18 Mice and pigs express IFITM orthologs of their human counterparts, and are induced by interferon similarly. 19 The IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 proteins exhibit antiviral activity, including restricting influenza A, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus infection. [20] [21] [22] IFITMs are the only known host restriction factors to block a prefusion step in virus replication. 23 This event occurs in the late endosome or lysosome; however, the exact molecular mechanism of restriction is still unclear. Studies suggest that the prefusion restriction is a result of IFITM presence in the endosomal membrane that renders it unable to achieve the conformational changes in membrane curvature required for hemifusion, an intermediate in the viral envelope fusion process. 23 One report suggests that IFITM proteins will also restrict wild-type, replicationcompetent HIV-1 24 ; in addition, IFITM proteins restrict in vitro entry of VSV G glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped HIV-1-based vectors. [24] [25] [26] We previously reported that GP64-FIV transduces mouse nasal airway epithelia with *10-fold greater efficiency than mouse intrapulmonary epithelia. 10 This difference was not the result of surface area, immune responses, or clearance because the difference was recapitulated in well-differentiated primary cultures derived from mouse septa and trachea. In addition, the transduction efficiency difference was also observed with VSV-G-and Ebola-pseudotyped FIV. 10 These data suggested that a cellular restriction factor was responsible for the difference in transduction efficiency. Here, we investigate whether the IFITM family of proteins contributes to the differential transduction efficiency observed between the nasal and tracheal airways.",

Doxycycline-inducible stable lines expressing C9-tagged mouse IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 were established. As demonstrated by Western blot, the levels of IFITM were detectable only in the presence of doxycycline ( Fig. 2A) . For the restriction assay, cells were treated with doxycycline or vehicle for 24 hr. The cells were then transduced with FIV expressing GFP and pseudotyped with VSV-G, GP64, or Machupo virus (MACV) envelope glycoprotein. MACV is a New World arenavirus that is reported not to be subject to IFITM restriction 22 and serves as a negative control. The native VSV ''G'' envelope glycoprotein has reproducibly been shown to be restricted 22 and thus serves as a positive control. The cells were transduced at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) sufficient to result in *20% positive cells in the vehicle-treated groups. Three days after vector transduction, the percentage of GFP-positive cells was quantified by flow cytometry. In the presence of doxycycline, we observed that VSV-G-FIV was re- stricted by mIFITM1 (Fig. 2B), mIFITM2 (Fig. 2C) , and mIFITM3 (Fig. 2D) . No significant restriction was observed for MACV-FIV. Similar to VSV-G-FIV, GP64-FIV was also restricted by each of the IFITM family members tested. These results were the first indication that IFITM family members restrict viral vector pseudotyped with baculovirus GP64 and may help to explain why GP64-FIV transduces mouse nasal epithelia with greater efficacy than mouse intrapulmonary airways.",

We observed significantly increased levels of gene transfer in both the nose and lung of knockout mice (Fig. 3) . Because basal IFITM expression is higher in the intrapulmonary airways than in the nasal airways (Fig. 1) , we hypothesized that in Ifitm locus knockout mice the level of transgene expression in the intrapulmonary airways would equilibrate to the levels of expression in the nasal airways. However, we observed that nasal luciferase expression after GP64-FIV transduction in knockout mice was enhanced to a greater extent than was observed in the lung. In addition, gene transfer to the lung of knockout mice was similar to gene transfer to the nose of hemizygous littermates. These data suggest that one or more of the IFITM family members are restriction factors to lentiviral gene transfer in both the nasal and intrapulmonary airways of mice.

On the basis of the microarray results, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were equally expressed; furthermore, no differences were observed in other putative restriction factors such as tetherin, MOV10, or TRIM5a (data not shown). These data suggest that the differential expression pattern of IFITM family members may be species specific.",

We observed that the IFITM proteins restrict GP64-FIV transduction of stable cell lines. In addition, Ifitm locus knockout mice were more permissive to GP64-FIV transduction than were hemizygous littermates. These results suggest IFITMs may contribute to the differential transduction of mouse nasal and lung airways. However, a greater increase in luciferase expression was observed in mouse nasal airways despite higher basal levels of Ifitm1, Ifitm2, or Ifitm3. Thus, addional factors must play a role.",

However, the mice used in the previous study were deficient only in type I interferon signaling and retained functional type II (IFN-c) and type III (IFN-k) interferon signaling. All three signaling pathways are thought to induce IFITM expression. 17 These redundancies may explain why the interferon receptor a/b knockout mice were phenotypically identical to wild-type mice in terms of lentiviral gene transfer properties.",

Importantly, pig models of cystic fibrosis manifest airway disease phenotypes present in humans with cystic fibrosis. 31, 32 Advantages of the pig as a model include lung anatomy, physiology, histology, and biochemistry that are more similar to humans. 33 In addition, pigs share greater DNA sequence homology with humans than do mice, have a larger body size, and longer life spans. Similar to the mouse, we observed that pig and human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 all restrict GP64-FIV transduction in vitro. However, unlike in mice, there was no difference in basal expression of IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 in tracheal and nasal airway epithelial cells. This is consistent with our previous observation that GP64-FIV transduces pig nasal and tracheal epithelial cells with equal efficiency. 10 We conclude that IFITMs partially restrict transduction of lentivirus-based vectors in both pig and human airway cells. We note that mouse, pig, and human IFITMs also restricted VSV-G-pseudotyped FIV, an envelope that The procedure was repeated for cells stably expressing Myc-tagged human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3. n = 11; *p < 0.001, **p < 0.00001. is widely used in gene transfer applications. 5, 34 Because it is known that IFITMs restrict entry of other enveloped viruses, including influenza, Ebola, and others, 20-22 our findings likely have broad relevance.",

In this setting, it is likely that the basal levels of IFITM protein have one chance to prevent the trafficking and fusion steps necessary for endosomal fusion and entry. The overexpression of the IFITMs in the inducible cell lines may represent the ''worst case scenario'' for viral vector transduction.
