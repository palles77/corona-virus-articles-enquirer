Metabolic acidosis develops as a result of intestinal and fecal loss of sodium bicarbonate, increased L-lactate from hypoperfused tissues, and increased absorption of L-lactate and D-lactate produced by bacterial fermentation in the intestinal tract. 1 As dehydration and acidosis worsen, clinical signs progress, leading to weakness, loss of suckle reflex, and recumbency. Vascular collapse and electrolyte imbalances can lead to heart failure, whereas death can also result from malnutrition and hypoglycemia in neonates.

Parameters for assessing dehydration in neonates are presented in Table 1 . 2 Also, a previous issue (March 2009) covers this topic as well. 3 Fig. 1 shows a calf with eyeball recession caused by dehydration. Signs of endotoxemia or septicemia: assess mucous membranes for color and capillary refill time. Assess the sclera for injected, dilated blood vessels. Septicemic calves may show evidence of hypopyon (Fig. 2) in the anterior chamber of the eyes, swollen joints, omphalophlebitis, or meningitis on physical examination. Evidence of sepsis negatively affects prognosis. Posture: the posture of the patient may indicate evidence of abdominal pain; for instance, abdominal distension, arching of the back (kyphosis), treading of the hind feet, and lying down with hind legs outstretched. In cases of overt abdominal pain, the possibility of surgical conditions should be investigated and ruled out. In primary cases of neonatal enteritis that do not show evidence of septicemia or endotoxemia, the attitude and posture of the animal can provide evidence of dehydration and metabolic acidosis. Recumbent animals with greater mentation deficits in general have more severe metabolic acidosis. Rectal temperature: body temperature may be either pyrexic, normal, or hypothermic in neonates with enteritis. Hypothermia generally indicates that the patient's body is decompensating. It may also be an indication of hypoglycemia. The presence of hypothermia is often a poor prognostic indicator. Body condition: poor body condition may indicate chronicity or malnutrition, which could be a compounding factor and worthy of further herd investigation with the client. Oral examination: examination for oral ulceration and hypersalivation (ptyalism) is important because some viral causes of enteritis can also cause oral lesions. The presence of a suckle reflex is important and helps to determine the most appropriate fluid therapy strategy. The presence of a suckle reflex makes oral nutritional support much easier and allows a more cost-effective treatment plan. Abdominal palpation, auscultation, percussion and succussion: abdominal palpation may help identify evidence of pain or allow palpation of abdominal viscera. Simultaneous auscultation and percussion (pinging) on the left and right abdominal walls aids in identification of viscera filled with fluid and air under pressure. Intestinal structures that may ping in a neonate include the abomasum, small intestine, and cecum. Succussion of the abdomen is used to evaluate for the presence of excessive fluid in abdominal viscera, including the abomasum, small intestine, cecum, and rumen. The presence of sloshing fluid sounds in the abdomen (succussion splash) is an indication of fluid distension of the viscera caused by decreased intestinal motility and fluid accumulation. Characteristics of the diarrhea: patients should be evaluated for color, odor and volume of feces, presence of tenesmus, blood, and mucus.",

Clostridium perfringens proliferates quickly postmortem, making definitive diagnosis difficult. Diagnosis is usually based on history, rapidly progressing clinical signs, necropsy findings, culture results, and the presence of toxins. C perfringens types A, B, C, D, and E can cause abomasitis or enteritis in young ruminants. Table 3 lists common diseases caused by each type and the specific toxins produced. The different types produce different toxin profiles, and the actions of these various toxins largely dictate the clinical signs observed. C perfringens type A causes hemorrhagic abomasitis and enteritis in calves. Clinical signs include pasty feces, which may progress to hemorrhagic diarrhea, accompanied by a painful distended abomasum. Clinical signs progress quickly and calves can be found dead without previously observed clinical signs. The alpha toxin is a phospholipase that causes endothelial damage, resulting in hemorrhagic and necrotic intestinal lesions. Normal abomasal pH and GI motility reduce the likelihood of clostridial overgrowth. Bacterial proliferation and toxin production are usually associated with decreased abomasal motility and increased abomasal pH. C perfringens types B and C both cause severe necrotic enterocolitis and enterotoxemia in lambs, kids, calves, piglets, and foals. The disease is characterized by diarrhea that swiftly becomes hemorrhagic and contains sloughed GI mucosa. Systemic signs progress rapidly from weakness, dehydration, and depression to toxemia and death. Progression may be so swift that overt signs of diarrhea may not be observed. Types B and C produce beta toxin, which is highly pathogenic but readily inactivated by proteolytic enzymes present in the intestinal tract, such as trypsin. Neonates are predisposed because of the presence of trypsin inhibitors in colostrum. The disease is generally seen in neonatal ruminants most commonly less than 10 days of age but can occur up to 1 month of age if trypsin inhibitors are still present in the diet. Diagnosis should be suspected based on rapidity and severity of disease, necropsy findings that include severe mucosal ulceration of the small intestine and colon, and identification of the bacteria in intestinal contents. Beta toxin assays are not generally available from diagnostic laboratories in the United States. C perfringens type D is associated with overeating disease and is most commonly seen in fast-growing lambs and kids. Bottle-raised animals and animals consuming large amounts of readily fermentable carbohydrates are most susceptible. The epsilon toxin may cause local intestinal necrosis but is also absorbed and results in systemic disease related to disruption of endothelial cells in affected organs. Please refer to Simpson KM and colleagues', \"Clostridial Abomasitis and Enteritis in Ruminants,\" in this issue. Clinical signs associated with peracute BVD include severe diarrhea, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic disease, and death. Persistently infected calves may have severe enteritis as part of mucosal disease syndrome or may be more susceptible to diarrhea caused by other diarrheal agents because of their immunocompromised status.",

            "text": "There are currently 13 species of Cryptosporidium with varying degrees of host specificity. Multiple genotypes of Cryptosporidium parvum have been identified and can cause enteritis in sheep, goats, and humans. 8 Although it can infect all ages of ruminants, clinical signs are typically seen in preweaning animals. Cryptosporidium hominis infects humans, and Cryptosporidium andersoni has been found in the abomasum of cattle but its clinical significance is unknown. Infection occurs via ingestion of an encysted sporulated oocyst. The parasite invades intestinal epithelium but remains extracytoplasmic, residing in the cell membrane cleft. Epithelial destruction causes mild to moderate villous atrophy, resulting in a malabsorptive diarrhea. Small infective doses can result in prolonged infection and high parasite burdens because of the phenomenon known as autoinfection, in which the parasite replicates within the host and is directly reinfective without exiting the body. The organism is extremely hardy in the environment and is resistant to most chemical disinfectants, including bleach and alcohol. Ammonia-based or peroxide-based products are effective. Care should be taken to avoid contamination of watersheds, which can result in significant environmental and public health issues. Diagnosis is through fecal smear or sugar floatation; however, the parasite is very small and may be missed by less experienced technicians. Acid-fast staining of samples increases sensitivity. In areas where acid-fast stain may not be readily available, there is also a technique for using more typical Ziehl-Neelsen stain to identify Cryptosporidium oocysts. 9 On-farm control of cryptosporidiosis is difficult because of the extremely high levels of oocytes shed and the environmental hardiness of oocytes resulting in a high environmental burden. The infective dose is small because of the replication and autoinfection that take place within the host. Several drugs have been tested and found to have limited activity against Cryptosporidium, including paromomycin, 10 decoquinate, 11 and halofuginone. Of these, halofuginone is considered the most promising but is not available or labeled in all countries and has limited efficacy in cases of multipathogen diarrhea complex. 12",

The choice of the crystalloids may depend on the test results of a serum biochemical analysis. When serum biochemical analysis test results are not available, a balanced electrolyte solution such as lactated Ringer or Plasma-Lyte should be considered for intravenous fluids. Both the level of dehydration at presentation and ongoing fluid losses caused by diarrhea must be considered when calculating fluid administration rates. Administration rates greater than maintenance are often necessary to treat hypovolemic shock caused by dehydration and account for continued losses from diarrhea. The patient's STP status must also be considered. Intravenous fluids should be administered with caution in patients with albumin levels less than 2 g/dL. Initial treatment of shock with intravenous fluid replacement may be indicated in severely compromised patients. A typical shock fluid therapy plan is to provide 90 mL/kg of intravenous fluids at a maximum rate of 40 to 50 mL/kg/h. 18 Slower rates should be used for small ruminants and in animals with low total protein levels. Signs of appropriate response include improved mentation and activity, decreased skin tent or eyeball recession, improved suckle response, decreased capillary refill time, and improved peripheral perfusion noted by warming of distal extremities. Signs of fluid overload include wet cough, harsh lung sounds, increased respiratory rate, and edema. General maintenance fluid rates for juvenile ruminants range from 4 to 6 mL/kg/h (100-150 mL/kg/d). Additional fluid losses from diarrhea may increase fluid needs by 50% to 100%. Thus, total fluid rates in ruminants with active diarrhea are in the range of 1.5 to 2 times maintenance. Any oral fluid administration also contributes to the daily fluid requirement and should be taken into account when calculating fluid volume to correct dehydration and when calculating maintenance requirements. Most neonates with enteritis have decreased nutritional intake and absorption. They benefit from additional intravenous dextrose supplementation. Dextrose may safely be added to intravenous fluids at a concentration of 2.5% to 5% when administered at a maintenance fluid rate. This concentration should be decreased proportionally when increasing fluid rate to more than Table 4 Recommendations for electrolyte, carbohydrate, buffering capacity, and osmolality of oral electrolyte replacement fluids used to treat enteritis and diarrhea in neonatal ruminants maintenance, or if blood glucose measurements are greater than the normal range (6.5 AE 1.2 mmol/L, 117 AE 21.6 mg/dL). 19, 20 Note that neonatal ruminants are effectively monogastrics and normally have higher blood glucose levels than adults, so adult reference ranges should not be applied to them. A reasonable goal for blood glucose management in calves is to keep blood glucose within 80 to 120 mg/dL. Correction of hyperkalemia can be accomplished by administering small volumes of hypertonic (8.4%) sodium bicarbonate, followed by oral electrolytes. 21 Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate can safely be administered at a rate of 6.4 mL/kg body weight (equivalent to 6.4 mEq HCO 3 -/kg body weight) as a bolus over 5 minutes in calves with diarrhea and evidence of metabolic acidosis.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics, with special attention to adequate gram-negative coverage, should be instituted in patients showing signs of endotoxemia or sepsis. Although the choice of antibiotics should be based on susceptibility of the isolate cultured, broad-spectrum antibiotics may be initiated while awaiting these results. Susceptibility of Salmonella to tetracyclines, ampicillin, and amoxicillin is variable, whereas resistance to penicillin, erythromycin, and tylosin is highly likely. 23 Florfenicol should be considered for treatment of salmonellosis. 23 Use of aminoglycosides should be avoided because of prolonged tissue residues in animals intended for food. Cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones may not be used in an extralabel manner in the United States. Tetracyclines should be avoided in dehydrated neonates until fluid hydration and renal perfusion are restored to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity. Use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; eg, flunixin meglumine) may be considered to control pyrexia and inflammation. Flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg intravenously) or meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg intravenously or subcutaneously) were reported to improve outcome in calves with nonspecific diarrhea. 24, 25 The use of NSAIDs should be restricted in dehydrated ruminants and only administered once the patient has been sufficiently hydrated. Metaphylactic use of antimicrobials can only be recommended for outbreaks caused by a specific bacterial pathogen. Prophylactic treatment with antimicrobials has been shown to increase the risk of diarrhea in neonatal calves. 26 ",

Few clinicians dispute a link between inadequate colostrum consumption and an increased risk for diarrhea in neonates. Supplementing calves with colostrum orally past the traditional 24 hours after birth decreases diarrhea and diarrheal treatments in preweaned calves 26, 27 A minimum of 150 to 200 g of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in colostrum or a colostrum replacer should be fed to calves within the first 24 hours (Chigerwe and colleagues, 2008) 28 to provide adequate transfer of passive immunity. The concentration of IgG in colostrum can be estimated before feeding calves using a hydrometer or a Brix refractometer. Evaluation of the passive transfer status of neonates provides valuable risk assessment, husbandry, and epidemiologic information in both individual cases and herd outbreaks. Passive transfer status can be assessed using STP, sodium sulfite precipitation, immunocrit test, or radial immunodiffusion. Other factors associated with an increased risk of diarrhea include hygiene of the maternity area and neonate housing, stocking density, and disinfection practices. Attention should be paid to maternal health prepartum as well. Vaccination of the dams before parturition with a K99 E coli, rotavirus, coronavirus product can reduce the diarrhea associated with that pathogen. 29, 30 Vaccination for other diarrheal agents is of varying efficacy. In beef operations, a method known as the Sandhills Calving System can be used to prevent calf diarrhea in a herd or to break a herd of a recurring neonatal diarrhea problem. 31 In this method, cows are continually calving on new ground, reducing contamination and reducing mixing of calves of different ages.",

            "text": "Diseases caused by Clostridium perfringensRotavirus is a common cause of diarrhea in neonatal calves and is often involved in coinfections with other diarrheal pathogens. The virus invades small intestine villous epithelial cells, and replicates in the cytoplasm. Infection is usually self-limiting because enterocytes undergo cytolysis faster than they can be replaced by the host. This infection causes intestinal villi to become blunted as villous epithelial cells are replaced by squamous/cuboidal epithelial cells. Small intestinal villus atrophy results in maldigestion and malabsorption. electron microscopic examination, or PCR. Other immunoassays exist but may not be readily available for clinical diagnostics. Feces collected early in the disease, during the first 24 to 48 hours, generally have a higher diagnostic value, because signs of diarrhea frequently continue after fecal shedding of viral particles has ceased. Viral infection begins in the small intestine but can spread to the colon. Viral S protein facilitates attachment and fusion with host cells. Mature villous epithelial cells are the primary target; however, crypt cells can also be affected. The virus replicates within the enterocytes and causes cell lysis. Disease caused by coro-",
