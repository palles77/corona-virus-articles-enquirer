A 68 years-old woman with cardiovascular and cholecystic comorbidities developed rapidly progressed pneumonia with influenza-like-illness as initial symptom, recovered after 23 days-hospitalization including 8 days in ICU. Laboratory indicators for liver and blood coagulation dysfunction were observed. Oseltamivir phosphate, glucocorticoids and antibiotics were jointly implemented, with nasal catheterization of oxygen inhalation for this patient. We obtained the medical records and collected serial respiratory and blood specimens from her. We collected throat, cloacal and/or feces samples of poultry and wild birds from the patient's backyard, neighborhood, local live poultry markets (LPMs) and the nearest lake. All close contacts of the patient were followed up and sampled with throat swabs and sera. Influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens were tested by real-time RT-PCR, viral culturing and/or sequencing for human respiratory and bird samples. Micro-neutralizing assay was performed for sera. A novel reassortant wild bird-origin H7N4 virus is identified from the patient and her backyard poultry (chickens and ducks) by sequencing, which is distinct from previously-reported avian H7N4 and H7N9 viruses. At least four folds increase of neutralizing antibodies to H7N4 was detected in her convalescent sera. No samples from close contacts, wild birds or other poultry were tested positive for H7N4 by real-time RT-PCR.",

The H7 subtype HA gene has been found in combination with all nine NA subtype genes [9] . Other influenza A subtype H7 viruses, such as H7N2, H7N3 and H7N7, were documented being capable of infecting human as well [10] [11] [12] [13] , but usually selflimiting.",

Analogous treatment [22] , such as the combination of antiviral, immunoglobulin and antibiotics therapy, showed effectiveness for treating H7N4 infection in this case as well. The patient's recovery was associated with the negativity of H7N4 virus in throat swabs and the elevation of neutralizing antibody titers to H7N4 in sera. Both results of clinical blood biochemistry tests, such as normal or decreased number of white blood cells and lymphocytopenia during acute phase, and fast progressed diffuse ground-glass opacities with consolidation indicated by chest CT scans, are the typical characteristics of infection with avian influenza, rather than MP, which is featured with slowly developing syndrome and bibasilar streaky infiltrates presented on chest CT scan [23] . The detection of HSV-1 was probably due to the reactivation of the latent virus [24] , and the detection of HCov 229E during the patient's recovery phase was likely a mild secondary infection. The occasional identification of Klebsiella pneumoniae in patient's sputum was probably due to a transient nosocomial infection or contamination [25] , as the pathogen was consistently negative for PCR in the patient's throat swabs collected from day 11 to day 27. Our PCRtesting platform for 28 respiratory pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, provided an efficient alternative for detecting infection or co-infection of pathogenic agents.",
