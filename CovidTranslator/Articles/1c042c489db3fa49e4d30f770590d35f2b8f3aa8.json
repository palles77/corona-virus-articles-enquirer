Viral infection has emerged as the most common cause of severe episodes of asthma. For the treatment of bronchial asthma, the root of liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) has been used as a traditional medicine in the East and West. Licochalcone A is the predominant, characteristic chalcone in liquorice root. To determine whether licochalcone A possesses an anti-inflammatory effect, we tested its effect on the expression and production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in BEAS 2B cells and primary bronchial epithelial cells. We found that polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly-IC)-induced TSLP expression was suppressed by treatment with licochalcone A in a dose-and time-dependent manner. We also found that poly-IC-induced mRNA expression of other proinflammatory mediators such as MCP-1, RANTES, and IL-8 was suppressed by licochalcone A. Furthermore, licochalcone A suppressed poly-IC-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity by suppressing the Ikb kinase (IKK) activity but not by direct phosphorylation of p65 at serine 276. Collectively, our findings suggest that licochalcone A suppresses poly-IC-induced TSLP expression and production by inhibiting the IKK/NF-kB signaling pathway, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of virus-exacerbated asthma. Further elucidation of the mechanisms underlying these observations can help develop therapeutic strategies for virally induced asthma.",

Bronchial biopsy studies have demonstrated the overexpression of TSLP mRNA in the bronchial epithelial lining in severe asthma. 10 The potential role of TSLP in virally exacerbated asthma is additionally supported by findings that double-stranded RNA-a viral infection surrogate stimulus-can evoke overexpression of TSLP and overproduction of its protein in primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) obtained from asthmatic individuals compared to epithelial cells from non-asthmatic individuals. 11 Inducible expression of TSLP in airway epithelial cells has been shown to be controlled by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB). 12, 13 Recent studies show that TSLP expression is induced in airway epithelial cells exposed to pro-inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly-IC), by NF-kB activation. 12, 14 Furthermore, licochalcone A has been found to inhibit TNFa-induced NF-kB activation by the inhibition of IkB kinase complex activation. 15 Interestingly, another study has demonstrated that licochalcone A inhibits LPS-induced NF-kB activation by direct inhibition of p65 phosphorylation at serine 276 (Ser 276). 16 Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of licochalcone A on poly-IC-induced TSLP expression and related mechanisms.",

In the lung, TSLP is expressed primarily by airway epithelial cells, and it has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the development of airway inflammation in mice. 26 Elevated levels of TSLP mRNA have been found in the airway epithelium of asthma patients. 10 TSLP can potently activate myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) by up-regulating their surface expression of MHC class II, CD54, CD80, CD83, CD86, and DC-lysosomal-associated membrane protein. 27 TSLP-activated DCs can induce na\u00efve T cells to differentiate into  inflammatory Th2 cells producing the classical Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, as well as a large amount of  TNFa. 28 Moreover, in vitro, only TSLP-activated DCs can induce allergen-specific Th2 memory cells to undergo homeostatic expansion and further Th2 polarization, as well as to mediate recall responses. 29 In this study, we demonstrated that the microbial mimic poly-IC induces TSLP expression in human PBECs and BEAS 2B cells via an IKK/NF-kB-mediated pathway. Both PBECs and BEAS 2B cells have a low basal expression of TSLP, which can be elevated by poly-IC exposure. This increase in expression was seen at both the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting the role of a transcriptional mechanism.",

Airway viral infections are a dominant trigger for worsening asthma. 32 Ample preliminary studies have shown the importance of RV-and RSV-triggered IKK activation, p65 nuclear accumulation, and DNA binding, all of which are characteristic of the classical pathway for NF-kB activation. 33-37 NF-kB regulation appears to be stimulus specific, and several recent studies have shown additional regulation by direct p65 phosphorylation at Ser 276 and Ser 536. 38, 39 Ser 276 is phosphorylated by PKA, while phosphorylation at Ser 536 depends on the IKK-or PI3K-dependent pathway. [20] [21] [22] [23] 40 In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, the inhibitory effect of licochalcone A on poly-ICinduced TSLP expression and production by the inhibition of IKK activation and subsequent NF-kB activation. Further research is needed to confirm the inhibitory effect of licochalcone A on RV-or RSV-infected bronchial epithelial cells.",
