There is an increasing awareness that public health education should be reformed to meet the demands of public health practice. This paper summarizes the current status of increasing public healthcare demand and public health service capacity in China, especially in lessdeveloped provinces, and introduces the current public health educational system and public health administration structure. The paper also provides evidence for a considerable gap between public health education and practice, and suggests possible measures to bridge the gap.",

Alongside this, infectious disease remains a serious problem, especially in the less-developed provinces of China, such as Guangxi and Yunnan. Both provinces are located in southern China, have a warm climate, many ethnic minority groups and a lower level of social and economic development. For example, the prevalence rates of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in Yunnan and Guangxi provinces are highest and second highest in China. The incidence rates of some infectious diseases, such as HIV and tuberculosis, are much higher than those in more-developed provinces, and pose a serious threat to the health and social stability of these areas. Additionally, both provinces are bordered by other countries of South-east Asia including Vietnam, Laos and Burma. Co-operation with these countries in order to prevent and control new and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as avian flu, H1N1 flu and HIV/AIDS, is an important part of the health strategies of the two provinces. 1, 2 Additionally, an inverse care law is in operation. The lessdeveloped provinces in China face much greater public health problems than the more-developed provinces, but there are fewer public health professionals available to respond.",

This, in turn, will increase demand for public health professionals. It has been recognized that there are insufficient qualified, capable public health workers in the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) and other public health organizations, 3 particularly in less-developed provinces. This is partly a result of the gap between education and practice in public health, 3, 4 with a need to develop capacity in the public health workforce for disease control and health protection, and also to ensure that health systems deliver effective healthcare. 5 China is currently reforming its healthcare system. The latest iteration of the direction for the reform has emphasized the importance of the public health system as one of the four essential elements of a basic universal healthcare system. Alongside this, in 2002, the Institute for International Medical Education proposed the Global Minimum Essential Requirements in Medical Education, which includes seven core competencies for medical students. 6 Consequently, the public health education system in China faces challenges from both recent internal healthcare reform and international public health trends for education and workforce development.",

Healthcare in both rural and urban areas in China is organized through a four-tired service system consisting of national, provincial, municipal (formerly prefectural) and district (in cities) or county (in rural areas) organizations and facilities under the management and supervision of the Department of Health. At each level of the system, there are hospitals and a CDC. Hospitals provide clinical care and CDCs offer preventive and public health services. More recently, in many cities and rural areas, community health centres and clinics have been established to re-inforce primary care, enabling the co-location of primary clinical and public health services.",

Alternatively, schools of public health and CDCs can be brought together to work more closely in other creative ways. A promising model has emerged in Yunnan. The Director of Yunnan CDC was concurrently appointed as the Dean of the School of Public Health of Kunming Medical College in 2008. This was the first appointment of its type in China. As p u b l i c h e a l t h 1 2 5 ( 2 0 1 1 ) 2 5 e2 9 a result, good communication, fruitful collaborations and a reduction in the educationepractice gap have occurred in the region. For example, senior experienced staff at the provincial CDC have been appointed as adjunct professors to teach at the school, and are able to participate in both teaching and research. Conversely, teachers at the school are also appointed as adjunct staff of the provincial CDC, so that they can participate in and observe the service work on the one hand and help with training programmes for the CDC on the other. Staff of the two organizations are frequently invited to give lectures and seminars at the opposite institution, and they can also attend each others' lectures and seminars of interest. Furthermore, municipal and county CDCs have become members of the teaching base of the school, and 18 municipal and county CDCs have opened their laboratory facilities to the school. These arrangements have extensively widened the opportunities for exposure to real public health work for both teachers and students, and also opened up many new opportunities for collaboration in public health activities across the two sectors. 17 The model for public health education in China needs to be reshaped to reflect the needs and implications of the new biopsychosocial medical model and the ecological model for the determinants of health, 18, 19 which would entail the development of a multidisciplinary public health workforce, rather than hygiene and disease control technicians.",

Most schools in China and worldwide are now called 'schools of public health'. However, in official communications and policy documentations in China, 'preventive medicine' is still used to represent all aspects and areas of public health. This may negatively affect the development of some new public health areas in the schools of public health. At the same time as maintaining public health as a medical degree, efforts should be made to develop multidisciplinary public health, which recognize the contribution to public health from many other disciplines.",
