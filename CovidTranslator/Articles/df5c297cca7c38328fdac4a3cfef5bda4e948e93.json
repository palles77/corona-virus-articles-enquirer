Samples from dromedaries ADFCA-HKU1-3 were selected for further analysis, and a sequence contig encompassing the 3\u2032 end of the ORF1AB gene through the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the MERS-CoV genome (\u22488,900 nt; sequence coverage 4) was obtained from each sample. Contigs from the 3 samples were identical, with the exception of a V221I (GTT\u2192ATT) mutation in the ORF4b protein of the sample from dromedary ADFCA-HKU2. The viral RNA content of the 2 human samples available for analysis was too low to provide long PCR amplicons (cycle threshold 35.5 and 36.9 by upstream of E gene assay). However, partial sequences of MERS-CoV spike (466 nt, contacts 1 and 2), ORF3-4a (273 nt, contact 1), and nucleocapsid (451 nt, contacts 1 and 2) gene regions could be detected from the samples. All of these sequences were identical to those deduced from the dromedary specimens. Genomic sequences determined from this study were submitted to GenBank (accession nos. KT275306-KT275315). The 3 sequence contigs obtained from the dromedary samples were phylogenetically closely related to those of viruses detected in humans in the Saudi Arabia, China, and South Korea in 2015 (Figure) . All sequences from this cluster, together with the partial ORF3-4a sequence detected in the sample from contact 1, shared 2 cluster-specific mutations, 79S (TCA\u2192TCT) and P86L (CCT\u2192CTT), in the ORF3 protein, suggesting that these viruses may share a common lineage. Apart from the unique V221I mutation, the sequences for viruses from the 3 dromedaries shared a unique ORF4a-Q102E (GAG\u2192CAG) mutation that was not found in any published MERS-CoV genomes. Other than those mutations, All 8 dromedaries were found to be RT-PCR positive for MERS-CoV and were quarantined in a separate structure located at the same border location. Active surveillance of persons with direct or indirect contact with the infected dromedaries was initiated. A sputum sample was obtained from contact 1; it tested positive for MER-CoV by RT-PCR on 12 May, 2015. 12",

Neither man had a concurrent medical condition or a history of exposure to human MERS cases in the 14 days before their first MERS-CoV-positive test results. Genomic sequences for the viruses derived from the men and dromedaries and findings from the epidemiologic investigation suggest possible zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV from dromedaries to humans. Although it is unlikely, we cannot exclude the possibility that the men and dromedaries were independently infected by other sources. Both infected humans were kept in the hospital for \u22482 incubation periods and were asymptomatic during this period. Clinical observations and positive RT-PCR results suggest that the men were asymptomatically infected with MERS-CoV. Asymptomatic infections have been detected previously (14) . Our findings provide further evidence that asymptomatic human infections can be caused by zoonotic transmission. It is not clear whether asymptomatic infection can lead to transmission between humans. Nonetheless, our findings highlight the importance of systematic surveillance of persons who have frequent contact with dromedaries. A recent study demonstrated that persons who have frequent exposure to camels are more likely than the general population to be seropositive for MERS-CoV (4). The unique border screening program and multisectoral collaborations highlighted in this investigation serve as a model for effective MERS-CoV surveillance at the animal-human interface.",

The infected dromedaries in this study were imported from Oman, which suggests that viruses from this clade are widely circulating on the Arabian Peninsula. Sequence analyses of MERS-CoVs found in South Korea and China do not suggest that viruses from this clade are necessarily more transmissible variants (15) . However, given that a single introduction of MERS-CoV from this clade caused >180 human infections in hospital settings (2) and that viruses of this clade are causing other human infections in Saudi Arabia, further phenotypic risk assessment of this particular MERS-CoV clade should be a priority.",
