To determine the mechanism(s) of protection, lymph node and central nervous system (CNS) tissues from SINVinfected mice treated daily for 1 week with low (0.3 mg/kg) or high (0.6 mg/kg) dose DON were examined. DON treatment suppressed lymphocyte proliferation in cervical lymph nodes resulting in reduced CNS immune cell infiltration, inflammation, and cell death compared to untreated SINV-infected mice. Production of SINVspecific antibody and interferon-gamma were also impaired by DON treatment with a delay in virus clearance. Cessation of treatment allowed activation of the antiviral immune response and viral clearance, but revived CNS pathology, demonstrating the ability of the immune response to mediate both CNS damage and virus clearance.",

Encephalomyelitis induced by infection with alphaviruses can be severe, with outcome dependent on the virus species (Babi et al., 2014; Baig et al., 2014; Bruyn and Lennette, 1953; Ethier and Rogg, 2012; Harvala et al., 2009; Lury and Castillo, 2004; Mancao et al., 2009; Przelomski et al., 1988; Reddy et al., 2008; Rivas et al., 1997; Rozdilsky et al., 1968; Schultz et al., 1977; Vilcarromero et al., 2010) . Eastern equine encephalitis virus is most neurovirulent with fatalities most commonly in infants and children and frequent neurologic sequelae in those that survive (Deresiewicz et al., 1997; Finley et al., 1955) . Currently, no treatments beyond supportive care are available, and no licensed vaccines for alphavirus encephalomyelitis are approved for non-military human use, so there is a need to identify new approaches to treatment (Go et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "The immune response to alphavirus infection of the CNS presents a double-edged sword: while the immune response is necessary for bringing virus replication and production under control, it is also responsible for many of the pathological changes and neurological damage produced. After infection with the neurovirulent NSV strain of SINV, fatal encephalomyelitis coincides with infiltration of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells into the brain (Kulcsar et al., 2014) , and in studies of mice lacking components of the immune response, particularly T cell deficits, mortality and severity of disease are decreased (Rowell and Griffin, 2002; Kimura and Griffin, 2003) . Furthermore, previous studies have shown that inhibition of the immune response and glutamate excitotoxicity with 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl) propranoic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists can protect NSVinfected mice from fatal encephalomyelitis (Greene et al., 2008; Nargi-Aizenman et al., 2004) . DON is a diazo-containing glutamine analog that acts as a broad irreversible competitive inhibitor of several glutamine-utilizing enzymes (Thangavelu et al., 2014) . During growth and proliferation, T cells preferentially use glutamine instead of glucose as an energy source, and rapidly dividing activated T cells show increased glutamine uptake and metabolism Maciolek et al., 2014) . Therefore, glutamine antagonism can inhibit lymphocyte proliferation (Wang et al., 2011) . In the CNS, the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is synthesized from glutamine by the amidohydrolase enzyme glutaminase. Excess production of glutamate leads to neuronal death through glutamate excitotoxicity, so inhibition of glutaminase via DON might abrogate this process (Sattler and Tymianski, 2001) . In support of this approach, mice infected with the fatal NSV strain of SINV show reduced mortality with DON treatment (Manivannan et al., 2016) , and in the less virulent TE strain of SINV, DON reduces the development of clinical disease and hippocampus-dependent memory deficits .

Because lymphocyte proliferation in response to antigen stimulation requires utilization of glutamine as an energy source (Maciolek et al., 2014) , we hypothesized that treatment with DON would reduce production of SINV-specific lymphocytes and infiltration of immune cells into the CNS during SINV infection. To examine the effect of daily low (0.3 mg/kg) and high (0.6 mg/kg) doses of DON on the cellular immune response to infection, changes in the numbers of total cells and of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and B cells were evaluated in the CLNs, brains, and spinal cords of SINV-infected mice during DON treatment (5 and 7 DPI) and after cessation of treatment (9 and 11 DPI) (Fig. 1) . Mononuclear cells were isolated from tissue homogenates, total live cells were counted , low (0.3 mg/kg) dose DON, or high (0.6 mg/kg) dose DON at 5, 7, 9, and 11 DPI (n =2-5 pooled mice per group per time point from 2 to 3 independent experiments, except for SINV, 0.6 mg/kg DON group at 11 DPI, which is from 1 to 2 independent experiments; data presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM; double-headed arrows indicate the period of DON treatment; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, by Tukey's multiple comparisons test).",

While inflammation and pathological changes were present throughout the brain, the hippocampus was chosen for closer evaluation due to the predilection of SINV for those neurons (Kimura and Griffin, 2003) . In the hippocampi and spinal cords of untreated, SINV-infected mice, perivascular cuffs of mononuclear cells and increased parenchymal cellularity were appreciable by 7 DPI (Figs. 2A and 3A). At 7 and 9 DPI, there was disruption of neuronal architecture in the hippocampus, with multifocal areas of granule cell loss and immune cell infiltration in the dentate gyrus ( Fig. 2A) , and at 9 DPI, tissue necrosis was noted in the lateral ventral horn of the spinal cord (Fig. 3A) . Increased inflammation and pathological changes had resolved by 11 DPI. Compared to mock-infected controls (data not shown), there was no evidence of increased inflammation or pathological changes in the brains or spinal cords of SINV-infected mice treated with low or high dose DON during the period of drug administration. Following cessation of treatment, perivascular cuffs of mononuclear cells became apparent at 9 and 11 DPI in the hippocampi and spinal cords of SINV-infected mice previously treated with DON.

Increased numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were present at 7 and 9 DPI in the hippocampi of SINV-infected mice (Fig. 5A) . TUNEL-positive cells were only rarely detectable in hippocampi of SINV-infected mice treated with low or high dose DON during the period of treatment, but increased in frequency within the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus at 9 DPI. At 11 DPI, TUNEL-positive cells were only rarely found in the hippocampi of all groups. In spinal cord sections of SINV-infected mice TUNEL-positive cells were present throughout at 7 and 9 DPI with fewer at either 5 or 11 DPI (Fig. 6A) . TUNEL-positive cells were only rarely present in spinal cords of SINV-infected mice treated with low or high dose DON at any of the time points. Quantification of TUNEL-positive cells showed that untreated, SINV-infected mice had more cell death than SINV-infected, low or high dose DON-treated mice in the hippocampus at 9 DPI (Fig. 5B ) and in the spinal cord at 7 and 9 DPI (Fig. 6B ). Evidence of cell death was comparable between groups at 5 and 11 DPI in both tissues.",

Anti-SINV IgM and IgG in the sera of low and high dose DON-treated mice increased following cessation of treatment at 11 DPI. SINV-specific brain IgM (Fig. 7C) and IgG (Fig. 7D ) differed among treatment groups (p < 0.0001 for both IgM and IgG, two-way ANOVA) but increases were delayed in comparison to appearance of antibody in serum. Brain anti-SINV antibody was higher in untreated mice compared to both low and high dose DON-treated mice at 11 DPI for IgM and at 9 and 11 DPI for IgG. Anti-SINV IgM and IgG increased in the brains of low dose DON-treated, but not high dose DON-treated mice following cessation of treatment. These results show that glutamine antagonism decreases anti-SINV antibody production in the serum and brain during SINV infection, and that cessation of treatment allows increases in production. V.K.

Following cessation of DON treatment, IFN-\u03b3 expression increased starting at 9 DPI, with both SINV-infected, low and high dose DON-treated mice having significantly increased expression compared to untreated, SINV-infected mice at 11 DPI. IFN\u03b3 levels were below the level of detection in the brains of mock-infected mice and in brains of SINV-infected, low and high dose DON-treated mice during the period of drug administration at 5 and 7 DPI.

Treatment with DON for one week after infection impaired proliferation of lymphocytes in the draining CLNs and infiltration of mononuclear cells into the brain and spinal cord. This impaired immune response resulted in a decrease in pathological changes and fewer TUNEL-positive cells in the CNS but also reduced production of SINV-specific antibody and IFN-\u03b3, resulting Fig. 8 .

DON affected the immune response mostly during the period of treatment, so the effects on CNS pathology and virus clearance were transient and, upon cessation of treatment, the immune response was activated, CNS pathology appeared, and virus clearance initiated more quickly in low dose-treated than high dosetreated animals. DON had a variable effect on SINV-induced glial markers of glutamate excitotoxicity, suggesting that the primary mechanism for decreasing pathology is through modulation of the immune response. When neurons are infected with a virus, three possible outcomes may occur (Griffin, 2011) . First, the virus may directly kill the neuron by inducing processes such as apoptosis or necrosis (Havert et al., V.K. Baxter et al. Virology 508 (2017) 134-149 2000; Lewis et al., 1999 Lewis et al., , 1996 . Second, the neuron may be damaged or die through a secondary process, such as effects of inflammation or glutamate excitotoxicity (Conrady et al., 2010; Greene et al., 2008) . Activation of nearby microglia and astrocytes that release reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes that release cytokines may all facilitate neuronal damage (Tilleux and Hermans, 2007) . And lastly, virus infection of the neuron may be controlled through noncytolytic immune mechanisms so the cell survives. Because SINV RNA persists after infectious virus is cleared, the immune system must continually control virus reactivation.",

While macrophages can sometimes be a source of IFN-\u03b3 (Darwich et al., 2009) , natural killer (NK) cells are more likely to be the non-T cell source of IFN-\u03b3 in this situation (Trinchieri et al., 1984) . NK cells can be quickly activated to produce IFN-\u03b3 (Sun and Lanier, 2011) and proliferate in response to virus infection (Biron et al., 1983; Dokun et al., 2001; Sun et al., 2009; Lopez-Verges et al., 2011) . However, the metabolic requirements for NK cell proliferation have not been extensively studied (Gardiner and Finlay, 2017) , so the requirement for glutamine may be less than that of T cells. Therefore, we speculate that NK cells account for the early increase in Ifng mRNA and IFN-\u03b3 protein in the brains of DON-treated mice and contribute to the increases in untreated infected mice (Figs. 7E and F), but more investigation into this question is required.",

M. Lee et al., 1999; Nicotera and Orrenius, 1998) . Hippocampal neurons in the brain and motor neurons in the spinal cord are especially sensitive to glutamate excitotoxicity (Carriedo et al., 2000; Nadler et al., 1978; Olney et al., 1979; Rothstein et al., 1993) , and the process plays a role in SINVinduced pathology (Darman et al., 2004; Nargi-Aizenman et al., 2004) .

Expression of GFAP, an astrocyte protein up-regulated in response to neuronal damage and local cytokine production, was not affected by DON treatment, consistent with induction of an innate response to SINV infection. GLT1/EAAT2, which is primarily expressed by astrocytes but also found on microglia, is responsible for the majority of glutamate uptake from the synaptic cleft and thus an important player in the prevention of excitotoxicity (Danbolt, 2001) . Several CNS virus infections, including NSV, human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43, human T-lymphotropic virus, and human cytomegalovirus, downregulate GLT1 expression (Akaoka et al., 2001; Brison et al., 2011; Darman et al., 2004; Irani, 2008, 2007; Zhang et al., 2014) , but others, including herpes simplex virus and Japanese encephalitis virus infection, induce upregulation (Mishra et al., 2007 (Mishra et al., , 2008 Persson et al., 2007) . In our study, SINV infection reduced GLT1 expression in the brain as determined by both IHC and immunoblot at 7 DPI compared to mock-infected control mice. However, DON treatment inconsistently restored expression of GLT1 in the brain at 7 DPI, with comparable expression of GFAP compared to untreated, SINV-infected mice.",

Virology 508 (2017) 134-149 (BBB) could explain the inconsistent effect of drug administration on glutamate excitotoxicity Potter et al., 2015) . During SINV infection, approximately 50% of mice treated with DON develop clinical signs of encephalomyelitis by 7 DPI, compared to almost 100% of untreated, SINV-infected mice . Because the immune response is almost completely absent in CNS during the period of DON treatment, this suggests another mechanism, such as glutamate excitotoxicity, is contributing to clinical disease development. Therefore, while we can conclude that DON treatment suppresses immune cell proliferation in the periphery, leading to decreased cell death but delayed virus clearance in the CNS, it likely has less of an effect on glutamate excitotoxicity due to its poor ability to cross the BBB, resulting in residual clinical disease development. However, a prodrug version of DON containing a methyl-POM on the amine and isopropyl ester on the carboxylate that achieves a tenfold higher cerebrospinal fluid to plasma ratio compared to the parent DON in rhesus macaques has been recently developed (Rais et al., 2016) . Treatment for alphavirus encephalomyelitis is currently limited to supportive care that is usually only initiated once clinical disease develops, and glutamine antagonists such as DON provide an attractive potential therapy. DON is effective against several tumors (Magill et al., 1957; Rais et al., 2016; Shelton et al., 2010; Sullivan et al., 1988) , and its immune suppressive properties prevent allograft rejection and attenuate clinical signs associated with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Plasmodium infection (Gordon et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2015; Plaimas et al., 2013; Shijie et al., 2009 ). However, gastrointestinal toxicity observed both in mice Rais et al., 2016) and in human trials (Earhart et al., 1990 (Earhart et al., , 1982 Sklaroff et al., 1980) has limited use of DON as a therapeutic agent, and DON prodrugs with reduced toxicity are in development. Regardless, because the immune system plays a role in both CNS pathology and virus clearance, thoughtful consideration should be employed when evaluating drugs that suppress the immune system as potential therapeutics for alphavirus encephalomyelitis.",
