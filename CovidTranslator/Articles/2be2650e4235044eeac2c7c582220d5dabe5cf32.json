Only seven cases of influenza vaccine-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been reported. 2 We report herein the case of an elderly patient with severe COPD who developed fever with worsening of respiratory symptoms and severe hypoxemia requiring ventilatory support shortly after influenza vaccination. The diagnosis of acute eosinophilic pneumonia was made by bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The clinical symptoms and radiographic abnormalities improved following systemic corticosteroid treatment.",

Bronchoalveolar lavage was compatible with acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Rapid clinical improvement was observed 2 weeks after systemic corticosteroid treatment, followed by radiographic improvement at 4 weeks. No disease recurrence was observed at the 6-month follow-up. Initial laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.52 \u00c2 10 9 /l (neutrophils 84%, lymphocytes 9%, monocytes 6%, and eosinophils 1%). Blood chemistry was normal except for albumin of 19 g/l (normal 34-50 g/l). The initial chest radiograph revealed multiple patchy and/or peribronchial opacities in both lungs, notably in the right upper lobe ( Figure 1A ). Sputum collection was inadequate for microbiological analysis. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza and other common respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR was negative. Intravenous ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin were given.",

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest (Figure 1 , B and C) revealed multi-focal areas of airspace consolidation involving the bilateral lower lobes and the right middle lobe, with a large area of ground-glass opacity with superimposed interlobular septal thickening in the right upper lobe.

Gram stain, acid-fast bacillus (AFB) stain, PCR testing for tuberculosis (TB), multiplex PCR for common respiratory viruses such as adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, etc., fungal stain, and bacterial culture of the BAL fluid were all negative. A repeated blood count showed a WBC count of 10.2 \u00c2 10 9 /l (neutrophils 73%, lympho-cytes 9%, monocytes 9%, and eosinophils 9%).

Additionally, the compensation of other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1a/b could exert cytokine storm effects due to a defective influenza-specific IFN-g response in this patient, contributing to the acute lung injury and systemic inflammatory responses. It has previously been demonstrated in cytokine receptor gene knockout mice that an up-regulation of other cytokines upon viral infection could be responsible for the cytokine storm that potentially occurred in these mice. 5 Such hyperinflammatory responses possibly manifest as an endothelial dysfunction with increased pulmonary capillary permeability and as a sepsis syndrome.",
