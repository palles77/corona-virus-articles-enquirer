Priscilla Yang gave the first ISAR Women in Science lecture. She reported on pharmacological validation of new antiviral targets for dengue, Zika and other flaviviruses. The William Prusoff Young Investigator Lecture Award by Maaike Everts described the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance and the Antiviral Drug Discovery and Development Consortium, and how they are helping to accelerate the development of new antivirals. The 30th ICAR was a success in promoting new discoveries in antiviral drug development and research. The 31st ICAR will be held in Porto, Portugal, June 11e15, 2018.",

The 30th ICAR was held in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, from May 21e25, 2017. As in previous years (Vere Hodge, 2014 Hodge, , 2015 Hodge, , 2017 , the meeting provided an interdisciplinary forum at which investigators involved in basic, translational, and clinical research worldwide met to review recent developments in all areas of antiviral research, drug and vaccine development. This is critical, because the successful discovery and development of new therapies requires close cooperation among scientists from diverse scientific disciplines. The overarching goal of the conference is to drive the discovery of new antiviral therapies by fostering collaboration among scientists from the fields of basic virology, medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, animal models of disease and toxicology in academia and the pharmaceutical industry.",

The Antiviral Immunity Symposium discussed strategies to utilize the immune response of the host in conjunction with antiviral drugs to control chronic infections, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. New small molecules targeting viral entry for flavivirus or influenza virus infections were also discussed. The Emerging Infections Symposium discussed viral infections of global concern and the potential for antiviral drugs to treat infections and mitigate the effects of emerging epidemics, including hemorrhagic fever viruses, rodentborne viruses and emerging coronavirus pandemic disease. The Respiratory Virus sessions described common respiratory viral diseases such as respiratory syncytial virus, human coronaviruses, and enteroviruses that cause significant morbidity and mortality. Other sessions included hepatitis viruses and retroviruses, emerging viruses, DNA and respiratory viruses and medicinal chemistry.

The new compound proved to be active in genotype-1 patients, but was limited by the presence of active and inactive stereoisomers; final success was not achieved until a novel synthetic method produced the molecule now known as sofosbuvir (Ross et al., 2011) . The true watershed moment came with the ELECTRON study in genotype 2 or 3 patients, in which a 12-week course of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin produced a 100% cure rate. The rest is history! Mike then turned his attention to chronic hepatitis B, which is currently managed through long-term administration of nucleoside/tide analogs and peg-IFN, which suppresses viral replication and slows disease progression, but rarely produces a cure. Two factors are responsible for the limited efficacy of current treatment: the state of immune tolerance induced by massive, continuous production of subviral particles, and persistence of the cccDNA HBV genome in the nucleus of infected cells. This double barrier has discouraged research efforts: except for the new alafenamide prodrug of tenofovir, no new anti-HBV drug has been introduced in the past 10 years (Fig. 2) .",

Recognizing that curative therapy of hepatitis B must both inhibit viral replication and restore immune function, and will likely require a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action, they are taking two different approaches. The first focuses on inhibiting assembly of the viral capsid, which is required for encapsidation of pregnomic RNA and the subsequent synthesis of cccDNA. The lead Arbutus compound AB-423 appears to act by binding to a site in the interface between capsid dimers that is highly conserved among viral genotypes. Testing in HBV-infected mice with fully humanized livers showed that ABV-423 significantly lowered viral DNA levels, and had an additive effect with entecavir.",

The lead product, ARB-1467, targets conserved RNA sequences, and is expected to be effective against any viral genotype, regardless of treatment status and in combination with any other therapies. A second-generation RNAi product, ARB-1740, has shown greater potency and more prolonged activity in mice. As expected, triple combination therapy with entecavir or peg-IFN \u00fe AB-423 \u00fe AB-1740 is highly effective, producing the greatest delay in viral recovery and greatest suppression of serum HBsAg.

During chemical synthesis and in vitro evaluation of dioxolane nucleosides as potential anti-HIV agents, DAPD (dioxolane-diaminopurine) was discovered as an interesting anti-HIV agent, which inhibited drugresistant HIV mutants against AZT, 3TC (lamivudine) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) in vitro (Chen et al., 1996; Furman et al., 2001) . It underwent Phase IIa clinical trials, which demonstrated efficacy in patients with drug-resistant HIV. DAPD (2,6-diamaino purine analog) (Fig. 3) is a biochemical pro-drug of a guanine analog (DXG), which is converted to a guanine analog by adenosine deaminase in vitro and in vivo. DAPD is more soluble in water than that of the guanine analog (DXG), which provides better physico-chemical properties as a drug.",

Efforts to block viral fusion and entry have traditionally been based on antibodies to the envelope (E) glycoprotein, but she reasoned that E could also be a target for small molecules, because the fusion process is catalytic: low endosomal pH triggers structural changes in E that lower the energy barrier for membrane fusion. However, in contrast to most small-molecule targets, E doesn't have a classical active site in which a covalent bond is made or broken, and it was also not clear where candidate drugs might bind. A possible ligandbinding pocket had been observed during initial efforts to determine the structure of E, when the protein was co-crystallized in the presence of the detergent beta-octoglucoside, but it was unclear whether this pocket was a bonafide antiviral target (Modis et al., 2003 (Modis et al., , 2004 .",

Screening identified three series of small molecules -2,4diaminopyrimidines, 4,6-disubstituted pyrimidines, and cyanohydrazonesthat interfere with entry. By linking the compounds to biotin or fluorophores, her group has shown that the inhibitors interact with the soluble pre-fusion E dimer, but not the postfusion trimer (Clark et al., 2016) (Fig. 4) , and that they block pHtriggered, E-mediated fusion of virions with liposomes (unpublished).

Attempts to engineer resistance by introducing other mutations were unsuccessful, suggesting that modifying the binding site has a fitness cost. After examining the sequence diversity of the analogous pocket present in multiple DENV isolates, the team engineered six different substitutions into recombinant E proteins and measured Kd values for representative compounds from all three inhibitor series. All of the compounds were affected by at least 2 mutations in the pocket, but with different footprints; however, the footprints of inhibitors in the same class were more similar to each other than to the other two classes. Comparison of amino-acid sequences among different flavivirus species revealed that residues deep in the pocket are broadly conserved.

In collaboration with Steve Harrison and Luke Chao, they have used fluorophoreconjugated inhibitors and a single-particle fusion assay to examine the stoichiometry of inhibitor binding, and have found that approximately 12 molecules of the cyanohydrazone must bind to a VLP to inhibit fusion (each VLP has 120 copies of E) (Schmidt et al., 2012) .

The RNA sequence revealed that this was a new type of rhinovirus, which had remained \"hidden\" because RV-C does not replicate in the standard rhinovirus cell culture assays e it uses another cellular receptor, cadherin-related protein 3 (CDHR3). The structural topography of RV-C differs from those of RV-A and RV-B, RV-C having spikes.",

Jeff Murry, Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA Jeff Murry reviewed potential therapeutic approaches to \"curing\" HIV infection, and the role of virus latency and antiviral drug resistance as major barriers to a cure. He defined three types of cure 1) drug-free remission, 2) functional cure, and 3) sterilizing cure. Infected T cells serve as a reservoir for viral persistence, and can be the source for clonal expansion of latently infected cells. One strategy for elimination of these latently infected cells is a \"shock and kill\" treatment regimen, using latency-reversing agents such as toll-like receptor (TLR)-agonists. Immune activation stimulated by TLR-agonists stimulates HIV expression. Surprisingly, vaccination increases plasma viremia in HIV-infected individuals by activating T cells, which then increase virus expression. Jeff described research on the use of the TLR7 agonist GS-9620, a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) for ssRNA. GS-9620 activates CD8 \u00fe cells more than CD4 \u00fe cells, and when used as a therapeutic in combination with the anti-HIV monoclonal antibody PGT-121 produces a synergistic effect, leading to increased killing of infected cells. He also described the use of combination therapy with a TLR7 agonist and a therapeutic vaccine, with the intent of combining a latency-reversing agent with an immune activator.",

She discussed several recruitment strategies, including intra-hepatic myeloid-cell aggregates for T-cell population expansion (iMATES), chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR) T cells recognizing HBV antigens in the MHCII context, and bi-specific antibodies. In the chimeric mouse models, and with the possible exception of CAR, T-cells were most effective when the viral load was first lowered to below 400 International Units. Cytotoxic T cells can clear cccDNA in culture, with or without direct contact with the infected cells. To eliminate cccDNA, the ideal T-cell target must have dual activity, including both cytolytic and non-cytolytic effects. APOBEC 3A and 3B are involved in cccDNA degradation, and are up-regulated in HBV-infected human liver cells, but DNAses are also required.

Several were identified as inhibitors of transcriptional activation. A second approach is based on high-throughput screening (HTS) assays, in which a luciferase gene has replaced the hemagglutinin (HA) to identify host factors and potential antiviral targets. The HTS assay requires growing the recombinant viruses in HA-expressing cells to phenotypically complement them, resulting in a single growth cycle in non-complementing cells. In this assay, inhibitors that do not select for virus resistance indicate potential host factors as targets. The third approach involves identification of targets for influenza virus mRNA splicing and export. Adolfo's lab has identified cellular binding proteins that mediate viral M-protein mRNA splicing.

Therein lies the problem in that there is only a single small animal disease model which involves infection of Syrian hamsters with Andes virus, the most prevalent South American species of hantavirus, and while the model recapitulates the disease manifestations of HPS accurately its predictive value for therapeutic studies involving immunomodulatory compounds remains unknown.

Broad-spectrum therapies capable of inhibiting CoV infections would address an immediate unmet medical need and could be invaluable in the treatment of emerging CoV infections. Timothy Sheahan and colleagues showed that a nucleotide prodrug GS-5734, currently in development to treat Ebola virus disease, can inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems including primary human airway epithelial cell cultures with submicromolar EC 50 values (EC 50 0.02e0.7 mM) with a good selectivity index (SI) in human and murine cell lines. GS-5734 was also effective against bat-CoVs, prepandemic bat-CoVs and circulating contemporary human CoV in primary human lung cells, thus demonstrating broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of GS-5734 significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory functions in both adult and aged mice.",

The differences between the replication cycles of HCV and HBV most relevant to antiviral therapy were highlighted. HCV is an RNA virus that replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm, without a DNA intermediate or any other means to establish persistent or latent infections, whereas the HBV replication cycle includes a closed-circular cDNA (cccDNA) nuclear-persistent form. The former can therefore be cured with any drug that efficiently inhibits genome replication or infection of new cells, whereas the latter also requires the elimination of cccDNA reservoirs. Nonetheless, the presenters were in general optimistic that lessons learned from HCV and HIV, together with the advances in antiviral therapy and immunology, will eventually lead to a definitive HBV cure.

John Tavis of Saint Louis University, Saint Louis, MO, proposed the RNaseH domain of the HBV polymerase as a target for antivirals that can be used in combination therapies. The RNaseH is a difficult enzyme to work with, as there are no in vitro systems in which to perform large scale screens. First-generation assays were undersensitive, resulting in under-estimation of the number of inhibitors. John's group has focused on known HIV RNaseH inhibitors as the starting compounds, eventually identifying 77 inhibitors. The RNa-seH from 13 HBV isolates (genotypes B, C, and D) were cloned. Their activities varied by approximately 10-fold, but all were sensitive to two of the inhibitors. Inhibition was additive with an experimental capsid inhibitor and synergistic with lamivudine. Two compounds inhibited viremia in Fah \u00c0/\u00c0 /Rag2 \u00c0/\u00c0 /Il2rg \u00c0/\u00c0 (FRG) chimeric mice by 0.4e1.3 logs, although they were limited by toxicity. Selection for resistance has not been observed so far. A poster by the same group further described RNaseH inhibitors derived from N-hydroxyisoquinoline-diones and related poly-oxygenated heterocycles. EC 50 s were in the submicromolar to micromolar range and 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC 50 s) in the mid-to high-micromolar range. As expected, the inhibitors block synthesis of (\u00fe) strand DNA, resulting in accumulation of RNA:DNA heteroduplexes in vitro and in cells. These presentations highlighted the potential of RNaseH inhibitors for HBV therapy, while also noting challenges in identifying and developing these compounds, as in vitro assays still have some intrinsic limitations.",

A presentation by Emily Thi from Arbutus Biopharma discussed the effects of STING agonists on HBV infection. The model is that STING activation results in reactivation of immune responses, thus breaking immunotolerance. In support of this model, it was previously found that activation of STING in macrophages resulted in inhibition of HCV in cultured hepatoma cells, and that, like several other viruses, HBV inhibits STING. Two STING agonists, DMXAA and a chemically-modified 2 0 -3 0 -cGAMP, a physiological STING agonist, decreased viremia and liver HBV load in the adenovirus mouse model. Treatment with DMXAA (25mg/kg daily for 7 days) caused rapid reduction, and repeated treatments equaled or surpassed inhibition by IFN treatment, although inhibition was highly variable. As DMXAA and the chemically modified 2 0 -3 0 -cGAMP are structurally different, it is unlikely that the antiviral effects resulted from off-target effects.

The Raf/ MEK/ERK signaling cascade is required for influenza A virus (IAV) replication, triggering the nuclear export of newly assembled viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). Inhibition of this cascade was previously shown to inhibit viral replication. Here, the first licensed MEK inhibitor for treatment of malignant melanoma, i.e. trametinib (GSK-1120212, Mekinist \u00ae ) and CI-1040 (PD184352) being developed by Pfizer, were shown to efficiently block replication of different influenza subtypes, both in vitro and in vivo. These compounds enhanced mice survival and reduced lung viral titers even when treatment started 48 h after infection, providing a prolonged treatment window compared to oseltamivir (Haasbach et al., 2017) .

Two FDA-approved antifungal azoles, i.e. itraconazole (ITZ) and posaconazole (PSZ) as well as the PI4KIIIb inhibitor enviroxime and the oxysterol-binding protein inhibitor 25hydroxycholesterol (25HC) had broad-spectrum anti-EV A-D activity, consistent with a similar mechanism of action against EV. Only ITZ and PSZ proved active against Par-A3, pointing to a different mechanism of action. ITZ and PSZ target an early step of the Par-A3 life cycle, displaying antiviral effects during pretreatment, coaddition, cell-free virus-compound pre-incubation, inactivation and attachment. Ketoconazole, fluconazole and voriconazole had no anti-EV or anti-Par-A3 activity. Interestingly, ITZ and PSZ were specific inhibitors of Par-A3 as other parechovirus types were not inhibited. Further studies are required to identify potential receptors involved in Par-A3 infection.",

These enzymes play a role in nucleic acid metabolic events, including RNA and DNA digestion, DNA recombination, DNA integration, replication fork repair, DNA repair, and microRNA (miRNA) maturation and function. Viral NTS enzymes include the HBV RNase H, the HIV RNase H and HIV integrase. Several compounds selected for their ability to suppress HIV or HBV RNase H activity were previously reported to inhibit HSV replication in cell culture.",

She also reported the anti-HSV activity of synthetic tropolones that were screened first by a colorimetric assay, then by a plaque-reduction assay, with the goals of determining a preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) and providing a starting point for future optimization studies. An intact a-hydroxytropolone (aHT) pharmacophore was advantageous for anti-HSV potency and additional aHT derivatives were therefore synthesized. The two most powerful inhibitors shared a common biphenyl side-chain, were capable of inhibiting HSV-1 and HSV-2 with an EC 50 of 81e210 nM and a therapeutic index >1000. They also strongly inhibited acyclovir-resistant mutants.",

USC-187 proved active against multiple AdV serotypes in cell culture and was effective against AdV-C6 in hamsters immunosuppressed by treatment with cyclophosphamide. Oral administration of USC-187 completely prevented or significantly decreased mortality, viral titers and liver pathology when administered up to 4 days post-AdV-C6 intravenous challenge. In a respiratory AdV-C6 challenge model, pathologic changes were not only the result of viral replication. The drug (administered orally at 10 mg/ml bid starting 1 day before virus inoculation) diminished viral titers in the lung, but this did not result in decreased disease, and eventually the pathology was exacerbated by drug administration, as evaluated by loss of body weight, indicating that USC-087 was toxic at the concentration used. Fine-tuning of drug concentrations in the intranasal AdV-C6 challenge model is planned.",

However, the corresponding nucleoside and nucleotide derived from T-705 were found to be quite unstable and their synthesis problematic. Johanna Huchting from Hamburg University, Germany has developed a reliable protocol for the synthesis of the T-705-ribonucleoside and its 5 0 -monophosphate. She also presented the first mechanistic study of T-705ribonucleoside degradation, using methods such as UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy, HPLC and HR-ESI-MS. The data revealed significant lability of both the glycosidic bond and the heterocycle (6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide) itself, even under very mild conditions. The degradation is proposed to begin with a nucleophilic displacement of the fluorine atom for the hydroxyl group, followed by destruction of the heterocyclic moiety and glycosidic bond cleavage. The decomposition of the nucleobase after the incorporation of the T-705-nucleoside triphosphate into the viral RNA can also lead to a mutagenic effect, representing one of the possible mechanisms of action of favipiravir.",
