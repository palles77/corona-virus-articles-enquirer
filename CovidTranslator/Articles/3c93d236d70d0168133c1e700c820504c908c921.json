An illustrative example is the poor who live in nations between the 30th and 35th parallels, also known as the \"horse latitudes.\" Focusing on the northern horse latitudes, emerging information reveals that the neglected tropical diseases are widespread in the Middle East and North Africa, Afghanistan, Pakistan, North India, Nepal, China, and in Texas and the southern United States, particularly vector-borne tropical infections such as dengue fever and other arbovirus infections, leishmaniasis, as well as selected helminthiases. In Texas a new tropical medicine school has been established to combat such neglected tropical diseases, but worldwide there is an urgent need to generate a public policy for these conditions, as they emerge primarily among the poor and disenfranchised.",

Indeed, one recent analysis finds that the largest number of cases of NTDs with high disease burdensdiseases such as lymphatic filariasis, foodborne trematodiases, Chagas disease, and dengue fevercan be found among the poor living in group of 20 (G20 countries) such as India, Indonesia, China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and to some extent, even the southern part of the United States [6] . The term \"blue marble health\" has been coined to suggest that the old framework of global health emphasizing developing versus developed countries may no longer hold [1, 6] . Instead, given that poverty is the overriding predictor of where NTDs can be found, it is the poor living in more developed countries that account for many of the world's NTDs [1, 6] .",
