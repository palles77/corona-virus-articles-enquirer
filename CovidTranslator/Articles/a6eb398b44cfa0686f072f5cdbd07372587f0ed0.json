It is likely that prolonged home stay may lead to increased sedentary behaviors, such as spending excessive amounts of time sitting, reclining, or lying down for screening activities (playing games, watching television, using mobile devices); reducing regular physical activity (hence lower energy expenditure); or engaging in avoidance activities that, consequently, lead to an increased risk for and potential worsening of chronic health conditions. 14 Therefore, there is a strong health rationale for continuing physical Peer review under responsibility of Shanghai University of Sport. activity in the home to stay healthy and maintain immune system function in the current precarious environment.",
