Thus far, only five variants of porcine torovirus (PToV) have been identified. In this report we describe the identification and partial characterization of a new strain of porcine torovirus (PToV-BRES) that was detected by RT-PCR in a swine faecal specimen from a farm in Brescia (Italy). The complete genes coding for the nucleocapsid (N), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and membrane (M) proteins were amplified, and sequence analysis showed that PToV-BRES is a new PToV strain that, based on the HE gene sequence, is phylogenetically related to P4 strain, that was up to now the only member of a distinct PToV lineage. The nucleocapsid protein from PToV-BRES was expressed in insect cells as a his-tagged protein, purified by affinity chromatography and used to develop an ELISA method to detect antibodies against PToV. This assay was evaluated using a serum collection including 45 samples from three commercial farms from Spain. High antibody prevalence against PToV was observed in the three farms, both in adult animals and in piglets, which could suggest that PToV might be endemic in Spanish porcine population. The ELISA method developed in this work could be useful in future epidemiological surveys about toroviruses.",

They were classified as a new genus within the family Coronaviridae, from the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh et al., 1994) , although the possibility of establishing two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae within the family Coronaviridae has been proposed and is currently under consideration (Gonzalez et al., 2003; Coronaviridae Study Group, 2008) . Torovirus genome consists of a single RNA molecule of about 25-30 kb. Genome organization is similar to that of coronavirus: the 5 two-thirds contain two large and overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, that code for the replication machinery. The last third of the genome contains four open reading frames, ORFs 2-5, coding respectively for the structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and nucleocapsid (N). Torovirus particles have a characteristic torus-shape nucleocapsid formed by the N protein interacting with the viral RNA. The nucleocapsid is surrounded by an envelope that contains the triple spanning M protein, and the S and HE proteins that conform the large and short spikes, respectively.",

Moreover, high seroprevalences against BToV have been reported in cattle from United Kingdom (Brown et al., 1987) , The Netherlands and Germany (Koopmans et al., 1989) . Although there are few reports about PToV epidemiology, high seroprevalences, similar to those of BToV, have also been reported in swine populations from Switzerland (Weiss et al., 1984) and The Netherlands (Kroneman et al., 1998) . Despite this extensive geographical distribution and the broad host range, these viruses have attracted little attention. This is likely due in part to the fact that torovirus infection has not been associated with disease causing important losses in livestock, but also to the lack of an \"in vitro\" system to work with most of these viruses, that has precluded the development of specific tools for their diagnosis. For a long time only the equine isolate BEV could be grown in cell cultures (Weiss et al., 1983) , and, it has only been very recently reported the ability of a BToV variant isolated in Japan to grow in cells derived from a human rectal adenocarcinoma (Kuwabara et al., 2007) . In addition, BToV can be propagated in experimentally infected gnobiotic calves (Woode et al., 1982) . Thus, there have been a few reports where indirect ELISA using partially purified BToV or BEV particles were used for torovirus serodiagnosis, but purification procedures are not affordable by all laboratories and, in addition, this assay would also provide low sensitivity for detection of antibodies to human and porcine toroviruses (Brown et al., 1987) . Torovirus serodiagnosis has also been performed by analyzing the ability of clinical serum samples to neutralize BEV infectivity (Weiss et al., 1984) . The virus neutralization test is \"a priori\" a very sensitive assay that provides also information about the existence of a protective humoral immune response in the animal under study, however, since BEV, a non-homologous virus, would be used to search for antibodies to torovirus in cattle, human or swine sera, the sensitivity of the assay would be reduced. In addition seroneutralization test is a time-consuming and difficult assay that cannot be used to perform extensive studies.",

            "text": "Thus, alternative strategies have to be undertaken to generate torovirus specific antigens for immune detection. A frequently used alternative is the expression of immunologicaly relevant viral proteins in recombinant expression systems (Chirnside et al., 1995; Denac et al., 1997; Pelosi et al., 1999; Farkas et al., 2005; Bogdanova et al., 2007; Hou et al., 2007) . For this purpose the nucleocapsid proteins from many viruses have proven to be very useful. Specifically, the N proteins of different coronaviruses including SARS have been expressed either in bacteria or through the baculovirus expression system and have been used for serodiagnosis (Timani et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005) . Moreover, the N protein is the most abundant protein in torovirus particles (Horzinek et al., 1985) , and strong responses against it have been reported from experimental infections of gnobiotic calves with BToV . Therefore, N protein from PToV appears as an interesting viral antigen to develop diagnostic methods. In addition, since the nucleocapsid proteins are usually highly conserved, serodiagnosis tests based on the use of PToV N protein may prove useful for detection of antibodies against other toroviruses.",

This method, that is a conventional procedure to determine neutralizing antibody titers for many viruses, has not been previously used for BEV. The reason being that BEV virus titers have always been determined by establishing the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) and neutralization assays were performed accordingly. Instead, we titrated BEV stocks by determining the number of pfu/ml (Garzon et al, unpublished results). Thus, BEV neutralization assay was performed as follows: 25 l of heat inactivated diluted serum (two-fold serial dilutions in DMEM, from 1:4 to 1:4096) were incubated with an equal volume of a viral suspension containing 100 pfu of BEV for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C. Virus-serum mixtures were added to confluent monolayers of E. Derm cells grown in 12-well plates.

After removing the agar overlay, cells were stained with crystal violet and lysis plaques were counted. The virus-neutralizing titer (ND 50 ) of each serum sample corresponds to the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution giving 50% reduction in the number of plaques with respect to that obtained with the virus without serum. Serum samples were tested by duplicate and negative (spf) and positive (CPS) control sera were included in each test. Neutralization titers were calculated using Spearman-K\u00e4rber formula. Serum samples with neutralizing antibody titers equal to or higher than 4 (or 0.6 that is the equivalent value in logarithmic scale) were considered as positive.",

Genomic information about other PToV variants is needed to understand torovirus evolution and to develop new diagnostic tools. In this work we describe the amplification and sequencing of M, HE and N genes from PToV-BRES. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis of HE gene showed a high sequence homology (92%) with the HE gene from strain P4, but only 73-78% with other PToV strains. Two PToV lineages had previously been described based on HE gene sequences, which are represented by P4 and Markelo strains. It has been suggested that these two PToV lineages were generated by recombination events into the HE gene between a parental PToV and an unknown donor (Smits et al., 2003) . PToV-P4 was detected in Italy in 1990, during an enteritis outbreak (Lavazza et al., 1996) , and since then no other strains have shown a phylogenetic relationship with it. Therefore, P4 was considered as the likely PToV parental strain, and Markelo-like strains (Markelo, P78, P9 and P10) could then be considered as recombinant progeny originated from it. Our finding of a new PToV strain phylogenetically related to P4 in a sample collected in 2002 suggests that at least these two PToV lineages might be currently circulating in porcine populations. Antigenic differences between HE proteins from both PToV lineages have not been determined but this possibility should be considered. In this regard, antigenic differences between the known BToV lineages have been previously described (Smits et al., 2005) .",

Antibodies against PToV were previously analyzed by BEV serum neutralization test (Weiss et al., 1984; Liebermann, 1990; Kroneman et al., 1998) , however, this method is time consuming and its sensitivity could be compromised by the fact that it is based on cross-reactivity between torovirus species. Besides, two ELISA assays to detect antibodies against BToV and BEV have been previously reported. Both methods were developed using sucrose gradient purified virus, obtained either from faeces from gnobiotic calves infected with BToV (Brown et al., 1987; Van Kruiningen et al., 1992) or from culture medium from BEV infected cells (Weiss et al., 1984) .

The torovirus nucleocapsid protein is the most abundant protein in the virions, and is highly antigenic as shown by the strong antibody response developed against it in gnobiotic calves experimentally infected with BToV. The N and HE proteins from BToV strain BRV-1 were expressed previously in E. coli and in insect cells (Duckmanton et al., 1999) , respectively, and both proteins showed immunoreactivity to specific antisera and field serum samples by Western blot. However, these proteins were not used to develop any diagnostic assay. Therefore, we sought to use N protein from PToV as antigen to develop diagnostic methods. Thus, recombinant nucleocapsid protein from PToV-BRES isolate was expressed in insect cells and purified by affinity chromatography. Using this approach, large amounts of highly purified protein were achieved. Recombinant PToV-BRES-N protein was used to develop an ELISA assay to detect antibodies against torovirus in swine serum samples. Moreover, given the high degree of N protein conservation, the developed assay may also be useful to study the seroprevalence to bovine and even human toroviruses.",

The assay prove to be very reproducible since very little variation was observed in the O.D. values of positive and negative control sera among assays performed in different days. Cross-reactivity of PToV with other related viruses infecting pigs has been discarded in the three assays tested (ELISA, Western blot and virus neutralization) and these results confirm that these viruses are serologically unrelated, and are in agreement with previous results described by other authors (Woode et al., 1982 (Woode et al., , 1985 Lamouliatte et al., 1987) . However, CPS antibodies recognized both PToV-N and BEV-N proteins (not shown), indicating that the animals used to obtain the serum had been infected by, or, exposed to PToV. Similar observations had previously been described with different batches of commercial newborn calf serum that were shown to react with BEV (Vanopdenbosch et al., 1992b) .",

Overall, ELISA results from adult animals from different Spanish farms located in Aragon (n = 20) and Navarra (n = 10) suggest a high prevalence of antibodies in Spanish pig population, since all 30 adult pigs analyzed from these farms were positive by ELISA, and these results were confirmed by neutralization test and Western blot. On the other hand, the high prevalence of antibodies in serum samples from piglets from the farm from Galicia suggests that PToV infection occurs early in piglets. This prevalence rate is higher than others previously reported for PToV in The Netherlands (81%) using neutralization assay (Kroneman et al., 1998) and for BToV (Brown et al., 1987; Koopmans et al., 1989) . However, these PToV prevalence rate data can only be considered as preliminary, since both, our, and the study performed in The Netherlands, were carried out with a short number of animals. Further epidemiological studies are needed to obtain definitive information regarding PToV prevalences in Spain and in other countries such as Italy, where PToV strains seem to normally circulate.",

Moreover, the nucleocapsid protein expressed by the baculovirus expression system could also be evaluated in immunization protocols to study its potential application for vaccination purposes against toroviruses. In this regard, protective responses elicited against the nucleocapsid protein have been reported for different coronaviruses (Wasmoen et al., 1995; Seo et al., 1997; Cavanagh, 2003) . In addition, we have reported a new PToV strain and three genes coding for structural proteins have been fully sequenced providing information about torovirus evolution. This work contributes to increase our knowledge about this scarcely studied, but highly prevalent group of viruses, provides important tools for future studies, and presents, for the first time, preliminary evidences on the presence of antibodies to torovirus in Spanish livestock.",
