            "text": "Bats have increasingly been recognized as the natural reservoir of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), coronavirus, and other coronaviruses found in mammals. However, little research has been conducted on bat coronaviruses in South Korea. In this study, bat samples (332 oral swabs, 245 fecal samples, 38 urine samples, and 57 bat carcasses) were collected at 33 natural bat habitat sites in South Korea. RT-PCR and sequencing were performed for specific coronavirus genes to identify the bat coronaviruses in different bat samples. Coronaviruses were detected in 2.7% (18/672) of the samples: 13 oral swabs from one species of the family Rhinolophidae, and four fecal samples and one carcass (intestine) from three species of the family Vespertiliodae. To determine the genetic relationships of the 18 sequences obtained in this study and previously known coronaviruses, the nucleotide sequences of a 392-nt region of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene were analyzed phylogenetically. Thirteen sequences belonging to SARS-like betacoronaviruses showed the highest nucleotide identity (97.1-99.7%) with Bat-CoV-JTMC15 reported in China. The other five sequences were most similar to MERS-like betacoronaviruses. Four nucleotide sequences displayed the highest identity (94.1-95.1%) with Bat-CoV-HKU5 from Hong Kong. The one sequence from a carcass showed the highest nucleotide identity (99%) with Bat-CoV-SC2013 from China. These results suggest that careful surveillance of coronaviruses from bats should be continued, because animal and human infections may result from the genetic variants present in bat coronavirus reservoirs.",

Coronavirus genomes are approximately 27-32 kb in length, the largest continuous RNA genomes among mammalian viruses [1] . Coronaviruses are classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta [2] . Coronaviruses are the second most prevalent cause of the common cold in humans [3] . In livestock and poultry, coronaviruses are recognized causes of enteric and respiratory infections that are often fatal in young animals [4] . An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003 resulted in infection of 8096 people worldwide, with 774 (9.5%) of them dying from this novel human coronavirus [5] . SARS coronavirus is believed to have been acquired from an animal species, and the Chinese horseshoe bat may have been the original source of SARS infection [6] [7] [8] [9] . The emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) may also have originated in bats, with fragments of MERS-CoV genes being identified in bats from both Saudi Arabia [10] and Africa [11] . More than 200 viruses have been isolated from and detected in bats [12] . The ability of bats to fly and migrate, as well as the large sizes of their social groups, predisposes bats to acquire and maintain viruses [13] .",

Although SARS-like and MERS-like bat coronaviruses have already been reported in the feces of Korean bats [14] , the prevalence and presence of coronaviruses in other bat samples have not been described. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of coronaviruses in Korean bat species using various kinds of samples, including oral swabs, fecal and urine samples, and carcasses.

The same Bat-CoVs were detected from fecal samples in the prior study [14] and from oral swabs in our study. Spike proteins, which are translated from spike genes, define viral tropism by receptor specificity and by membrane fusion activity during entry into cells [29] . Although the spike genes were not identified in this study, full spike gene analysis of Bat-CoV B15-21 suggested a low potential for human emergence. One MERS-like betacoronavirus, Bat-CoV B15-1-6 (KU528586.1, KU528585.1), was identified by Kim et al. [14] , but the similarity of this isolate to our isolates could not be analyzed because the RdRp sequence was not obtained.

For example, similar viruses were detected in the same species of bat in different regions, approximately 1600 km apart, while two different bat species in the same habitat had different coronaviruses [22] . In our results, three Bat-CoVs (16BF109, 211, and 244) from P. abramus were clustered with each other, even though samples were collected from different habitats in different regions (Andong, Yeongdeok, and Gyeongju). The Bat-CoV detected from E. serotinus bat in the metropolitan city Gwangju (16BF104) was also clustered with these three Bat-CoVs mentioned above. However, there was no matching virus for 16BF104 found in the same species of bat in other locations, nor in other species in the region where samples were collected. Our data could support the possibility of relationships between genetic variation, geographic locations where Bat-CoVs were isolated, and bat host species, but more data on Bat-CoVs in Korea would be needed to address this.",

We detected SARS-related and MERS-like Bat-CoVs that were genetically very similar to Bat-CoVs identified in China. For the study of Bat-CoV seasonal occurrence and transmission, continuous monitoring during all seasons is required, and ideally alimentary, respiratory, and other samples need to be collected from each bat. Future work to determine the complete genome sequences of Bat-CoVs from South Korea would give a more complete picture of their pathogenicity and the possibility of infectious spread to other animals and humans.",
