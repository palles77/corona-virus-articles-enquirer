            "text": "Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are highly contagious pathogens causing acute respiratory disease (ARD), among other illnesses. Of the ARD genotypes, HAdV-7 presents with more severe morbidity and higher mortality than the others. We report the isolation and identification of a genome type HAdV-7d (DG01_2011) from a recent outbreak in Southern China. Genome sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) comparisons with past pathogens indicate HAdV-7d has re-emerged in Southern China after an absence of twenty-one years. Recombination analysis reveals this genome differs from the 1950s-era prototype and vaccine strains by a lateral gene transfer, substituting the coding region for the L1 52/55 kDa DNA packaging protein from HAdV-16. DG01_2011 descends from both a strain circulating in Southwestern China (2010) and a strain from Shaanxi causing a fatality and outbreak (Northwestern China; ). Due to the higher morbidity and mortality rates associated with HAdV-7, the surveillance, identification, and characterization of these strains in population-dense China by REA and/or whole genome sequencing are strongly indicated. With these accurate identifications of specific HAdV types and an epidemiological database of regional HAdV pathogens, along with the HAdV genome stability noted across time and space, the development, availability, and deployment of appropriate vaccines are needed.",

Of the several respiratory disease-associated HAdV pathogens, HAdV-4 and HAdV-7 are among the most commonly reported and associated with febrile respiratory disease, in particular, acute respiratory disease (ARD) 2,3 . These two genotypes 4 , particularly HAdV-7, circulate globally and frequently in civilian populations 3, [5] [6] [7] . They are of such public health concerns that specific vaccines have been developed and deployed against them at two different time periods by the U.S. military 8, 9 . These successful vaccine periods provided an unintentional experiment reinforcing the effectiveness of vaccines in public health 10 . In between the two periods of highly effective vaccine deployments, the inexplicable suspension of the vaccination program resulted in a resurgence of ARD cases to prevaccine-era levels 10 . This demonstrates the effectiveness and supports the development, availability, and deployment of vaccines against the HAdVs that affect certain populations routinely and predictably, particularly those under stressed and high-density conditions. Two important considerations for this public health program are required, along with vaccines: 1) the ability to monitor, and to identify circulating HAdV types and 2) the presence of molecular data quantifying and char-acterizing genome changes that may occur during viral evolution, particularly at the antigenic epitopes, e.g., the hexon hypervariable L1/L2 regions [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

As an example, a higher mortality rate was reported for children infected by HAdV-7 in China during and also in Korea (Seoul) during 1990-2000, with mortality rates of 18%, caused by HAdV-7 genome types 7d and 7l, as compared with 3.6% noted for HAdV-3 infections 15 . HAdV strains compete against each other in host populations, with the presumably more robust ones replacing the previously dominant circulating strains. In a survey of 166 HAdV strains from the U.S. and Eastern Ontario/Canada , two genomic variants, that were previously absent in the population, were identified: HAdV-7d2 comprised 28% of the HAdVs reported and HAdV-7h comprised 2% 3 . HAdV-7d2 was first identified in the U.S. in 1993 and subsequently spread further in the U.S. and into Eastern Ontario 3 . It was concluded that both genomic variants represented ''recent introduction[s]'' from ''previously geographically restricted areas\u2026 herald[ing] a shift in predominant [genome type] circulating in the [U.S.]'' 3 . The origins of HAdV-7d, presumably the parent of HAdV-7d2, was noted as China, where it circulated from 1958 to 1990, having ''replaced HAdV-7b as the predominant circulating virus'' 3,7 over a period of 10 years (1980-1990) 20 . HAdV-7d, in particular HAdV-7d2, from China subsequently spread ''beyond [its] formerly geographically restricted regions'', e.g., to South Korea (1995) (1996) (1997) 15 and also Japan, Israel and the U.S. and Canada 3,21,22 . As another example of the severity of type 7 HAdV pathogens, the genomic variant HAdV-7h also produced more severe symptoms, including higher fatality levels, when it emerged and circulated in South America in the 1990s 23 .",

The genome type of DG01_2011 was determined by comparing its in silico REA profiles with other HAdV-7 genome types reported in the literature 3, 7, 11, 15, 20 . Although seemingly antiquated in comparison to genome sequencing, REA profiles are still useful for comparisons with unsequenced but previously reported genome types and strains, and also as rapid and less-expensive alternatives for large-scale characterizations of viruses given a correct reference strain. Using the genome type denomination of Li, et al. 20 , DG01_2011 is identified as HAdV-7d, evidenced by the REA patterns and identical with the first reported HAdV-7d 25 , as shown in Figure 2 . The REA patterns generated from DG01_2011, 0901HZ/ShX/2009, which caused acute bronchitis and pneumonia in an ARD outbreak comprising 70 cases amongst young children in the Shaanxi Province in 2009, including one fatality 24 , and CQ1198_2010, which was associated with an epidemic in Chongqing, Southwestern China (Ni, K., et al., unpublished; JX625134), are identical to each other and also identical with those of HAdV-7d reported earlier in Israel (1998) and Japan (1999) 26, 27 . The REA patterns of CQ1198_2010 in this study provide evidence to amend the less-descriptive designation of ''mutant HAdV-7d2'' noted by Ni, K., et al. in the GenBank entry for CQ1198_2010 (JX625134). For reference, the in silico REA profile for the prototype Gomen HAdV-7 is provided; the REA patterns for these recent isolates differ clearly from the prototype, as shown in Figure 2 . HAdV-7 prototype is the correct reference genome as three REA profiles, BclI, SalI, and XhoI, showed identical patterns and complement the REA patterns that differ, along with sequence similarities across the genome.",

Comparative genomics analysis documented seven single nucleotide substitution and one single base insertion differences between the DG01_2011 and 0901HZ/ShX/ 2009 genomes. Of these, two single nucleotide substitutions were localized in the ITRs and one non-synonymous substitution each was located in the DNA polymerase, penton base, and 34 kDa protein coding sequences (Table 1) . One synonymous nucleotide substitution each was present in the 100-kDa hexon assemblyassociated protein and Virus-Associated (VA) RNA II. The single nucleotide insertion was in a non-coding region of DG01_2011. There were three single nucleotide substitutions in coding sequences and seven base deletion differences in the ITRs between CQ1198_2010 and 0901HZ/ShX/2009 genomes. One synonymous substitution (C to T) was located in hexon assembly-associated protein (A254A) and the other two non-synonymous substitutions G to C and G to T were located in DNA polymerase (S55C) and 34 kDa protein (P87Q), respectively. The nucleotide deletions in ITRs of CQ1198_2010 may be sequencing errors given that the left ITR was not identical with the right ITR, or may represent recent mutations. If exclusive of ITR differences, there were only three single nucleotide substitutions between the CQ1198_2010 and 0901HZ/ShX/2009 genomes (99.99%). For strain DG01_2011, it had a higher genome identity with CQ1198_2010 (99.98%) than 0901HZ/ShX/2009 (99.97%) if exclusive of ITR difference.

All three genes have Ka/Ks ratios of less than 1 ( Table 2 ). This is in accordance with the hypothesis that organismal evolution is dominated by negative selection, i.e., ones removing mutations harmful to fitness 28 . Specifically, both hexon and penton base genes have less non- synonymous substitutions per site, which leads to the low ratios of Ka/Ks. Although the non-synonymous substitutions and Ka/Ks ratio of the fiber gene is also low, it is relatively higher than for the hexon and penton base genes. This may indicate that the fiber gene has less negative selection pressures, likely due to tissue tropism being determined and constrained by the fiber gene. Overall, the majority of mutations are synonymous and do not affect the integrity of the hexon, penton base, and fiber proteins.",

In 2009, HAdV-7 was identified as the respiratory pathogen in an outbreak that included a fatality in Shaanxi 24 and also in a 2010 outbreak in Chongqing (unpublished), signaling a reemergence. Thorough characterization of these pathogens is evidenced by the availability of two genome sequences (JF800905 and JX625134), both of which are further identified as the HAdV-7d genome type in this report, and shown to be nearly identical to this report of an isolate from a 2011 ARD outbreak in Guangdong Province (strain DG01_2011) by comparative genomics and, in particular, in silico REA pattern analysis, as presented in Figure 2 .",

For HAdV comparisons, the caveat is to use the correct reference genome; for example, HAdV-55 contains a partial hexon gene from HAdV-11, comprising approximately only 2.6% of the length of the genome, in a chassis of HAdV-14, comprising approximately 97.4% of the length of the genome 37 . Using the genome of HAdV-11 as a reference yields meaningless patterns that are subject to researcher-biased interpretations and leads to erroneous conclusions that HAdV-55 is a genome type of HAdV-11. Using the HAdV-14 genome as a reference provides a closer approximation of the genome identities 4, 38 . However, the recombination event revealed by whole genome sequencing, with the conflicting ''Trojan Horse'' renal pathogen epitope observed with ARD symptoms, indicates this was a novel and emergent pathogen 4, 37, [39] [40] [41] [42] . In contrast, for HAdV-7d, the prototype HAdV-7 genome provides the correct reference: three REA patterns are identical (BclI, SalI, and XhoI); four are obviously different (BamHI, BglI, HpaI, and SmaI); and four are highly similar with a few differences in the band patterns (BglII, BstEII, HindIII, EcoRI, and XbaI), shown in Figure 2 .",

In essence, however, the value and knowledge of the outbreaks, pathogens, and researchers of the past are not entirely lost if genomes of current pathogenic strains of interest may be compared with published REA patterns of past pathogens, as demonstrated in the genome type identities presented in this report. Whole genome characterization of HAdV provides a higher-resolution perspective of understanding this pathogen, which may or may not lead to better public health strategies and measures to prevent outbreaks. As noted for two species B ARD pathogens, HAdV-4 and HAdV-7, ''restricted use'' but effective vaccines can be and are deployed currently in the U.S. military to prevent ARD outbreaks [8] [9] [10] . However, even if there were no viable strategy to manage HAdV outbreaks, knowing the genome type, either by REA or by whole genome sequencing, allows an understanding of the epidemiology, including potential morbidity and mortality profiles, of the circulating pathogens.",

BLAST analysis reveals the recombinant region to encode the entire L1 52/55 kDa gene of HAdV-B16 with flanking non-coding sequences. The BLAST scores indicate the first highly similar sequence, aside from several type 7 sequences, is that from the HAdV-B16 prototype (Max. score 2710, Total score 2710, Query cover 100%, E-value 0.0, Ident. 96%) and a HAdV-B16 recombinant (2687, 2687, 100%, 0.0. 96%), with additional homologous and highly similar sequences found in HAdV-B50 (2436, 2436, 100%, 0.0, 93%) and HAdV-B21 strains (2422, 2422, 100%, 0.0, 93%).

In the latter, 440 patients aged between 17-22 years were reported as afflicted with ARD 62 . In Taiwan, there was a large community outbreak of HAdV-7 in 2011 16 . In this instance, an abrupt increase in percentage of HAdV-7 infections occurred, from 0.3% in 2008-2010 to 10% in 2011 16 . The hexon nucleotide sequences of five HAdV-7 isolates collected in Taiwan were identical to the sequence of HAdV-7 strain 0901HZ/ShX/ 2009 16 , which was also identical to DG01_2011. In the context of the data in this report, these ''Taiwan'' hexon genes formed the same subclade with strains 0901HZ/ShX/2009, CQ1198_2010 and DG01_2011 (Fig. 3A) . Given that only the hexon genes were sequenced, the exact genome types of these strains in the two outbreaks remain unknown. However, the possibility of a HAdV-7d genome type circulating is foreboding. Further data, including complete genome sequencing and in silico REA, are important to confirm this possibility.",

Additionally, the newlyredeveloped vaccines, which are now only accessible to the U.S. military 9 , should be made available to the civilian ''at-risk'' public to prevent ''preventable'' highly contagious outbreaks involving HAdVs associated with high morbidity rates and fatalities 5, 7, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] 30, 43, 45, 60, 61, 63 . In particular, the vaccine against HAdV-7 is urgently needed in China, due to the apparent decades-absence of circulating HAdV-7, which presumably resulted in a corresponding lower level of herd immunity in today's population. Given the higher severity of diseases and fatality rates caused by HAdV-7, especially HAdV-7d, extensive surveillance and corresponding molecular investigation, including genotyping, genome typing, and genome sequencing, should be carried out when confronting outbreaks of HAdV pathogens in the high-density populations of China to protect the public and the global community.",

For the recombination analysis, MAFFT software was used first to align the sequences using default parameters (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/). Default parameter settings for the Simplot software were used for analyzing the whole genomes, with the following input: window size (2000 nucleotides [nt]), step size (200 nt), replicates used (n 100), gap stripping (on), distance model (Kimura), and tree model (neighbor-joining). Genome nucleotide positions are noted along the x-axis, and the sequence similarities are indicated along the y-axis. For reference, select genome landmarks of the three major capsid protein genes are noted above each graph. Simplot analysis of the genome of strain DG_2011 (A) shows a lateral transfer of a small portion of the genome upstream of the penton base gene from HAdV-B16.
