Polymorphisms at OAS1 have been shown to correlate with differential susceptibility to several infections of great public health significance, including hepatitis C virus, SARS coronavirus, and West Nile virus. Population genetics analyses in hominoids have revealed interesting evolutionary patterns. In Central African chimpanzee, OAS1 has evolved under long-term balancing selection, resulting in the persistence of polymorphisms since the origin of hominoids, whereas human populations have acquired and retained OAS1 alleles from Neanderthal and Denisovan origin. We decided to further investigate the evolution of OAS1 in primates by characterizing intra-specific variation in four species commonly used as models in infectious disease research: the rhesus macaque, the cynomolgus macaque, the olive baboon, and the Guinea baboon. In baboons, OAS1 harbors a very low level of variation. In contrast, OAS1 in macaques exhibits a level of polymorphism far greater than the genomic average, which is consistent with the action of balancing selection. The region of the enzyme that directly interacts with viral RNA, the RNA-binding domain, contains a number of polymorphisms likely to affect the RNA-binding affinity of OAS1. This strongly suggests that pathogen-driven balancing selection acting on the RNA-binding domain of OAS1 is maintaining variation at this locus. Interestingly, we found that a number of polymorphisms involved in RNAbinding were shared between macaques and chimpanzees. This represents an unusual case of convergent polymorphism.",

Upon activation, OAS enzymes synthesize 2\u2032-5\u2032-linked oligoadenylates using ATP and newly synthesized oligoadenylates as substrates. These oligoadenylates trigger the dimerization and activation of RNase L, which acts as an indiscriminate RNase, targeting both viral and cellular RNA for degradation, thus stopping protein synthesis and viral replication. In primates, the OAS gene family consists of three active members containing one (OAS1), two (OAS2), or three (OAS3) homologous domains (Justesen et al. 2000; Kumar et al. 2000) . OAS1 has been shown to participate in the first line of defense against a wide range of viral infection including encephalomyocarditis virus, coxsackievirus B4, respiratory syncytial virus, West Nile virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV-1 (Silverman 2007) . Association studies have determined that variation at OAS1 correlates with disease severity of or susceptibility to several viral infections of great public health significance such as hepatitis C virus (Knapp et al. 2003; Zhao et al. 2013) , SARS coronavirus (Hamano et al. 2005; He et al. 2006 ), West Nile virus (Bigham et al. 2011; Lim et al. 2009 ), and coxsackievirus A16 (Cai et al. 2014 ).",

            "text": "The crystal structure of the OAS1 protein has recently been solved (Donovan et al. 2013; Hartmann et al. 2003) . OAS1 is a globular protein composed of two large lobes (N-and Clobes) connected by a linker region. In between the two lobes lies the active site within a deep electronegative channel. On the directly opposite side of the enzyme lies a positively charged groove, the RNA-binding domain (RBD). Upon binding an RNA ligand, OAS1 undergoes a conformational change resulting in the activation of the enzyme (Donovan et al. 2013) . Since OAS1 requires direct interaction with viral dsRNA for activation, it is likely that the evolution of this enzyme is affected by the evolution of viral pathogens or by the viral diversity to which an organism is exposed. Indeed, evolutionary analyses in rodents, primates, and bats strongly suggest that the evolution of the OAS1 protein is driven by hostpathogen interactions (Ferguson et al. 2008 (Ferguson et al. , 2012 Mozzi et al. 2015) . In chimpanzees, for instance, OAS1 is extraordinarily variable and it was shown that OAS1 haplogroups predate the origin of hominoids (Ferguson et al. 2012) . The retention of ancestral polymorphisms over such a long period of time is highly unusual and strongly suggests that OAS1 has evolved under balancing selection, a type of natural selection that maintains allelic variation in populations. In human, on the other hand, Mendez et al. (2012 Mendez et al. ( , 2013 failed to detect the signature of balancing selection, yet they made a very interesting observation: they showed that some contemporary human populations had acquired and retained OAS1 alleles of Neanderthal or Denisovan origin. However, it remains unknown if the persistence of these OAS1 alleles in modern human is adaptive, possibly conferring some advantage to the individuals carrying these alleles, or if this polymorphism is neutral.",

The sequences are deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KR260685-KR260713.",

Under neutrality, this ratio should be the same across the genome but an excess of polymorphism relative to divergence at a specific locus could be interpreted as evidence for balancing selection while a deficit of polymorphism would indicate positive directional selection. Statistical significance is assessed using a X 2 goodness-of-fit test. As neutral regions of reference for the rhesus macaque, we used 30 randomly chosen loci that had previously been sequenced in 38 Indian and 9 Chinese unrelated individuals (Hernandez et al. 2007 ). For the cynomolgus macaque, we used 26 non-coding regions that were sequenced in 24 individuals from three Southeast Asian populations (Osada et al. 2010) . For the two baboon species, we used the 12 neutral regions analyzed in Boissinot et al. (2014) . As out-groups, we used human and gorilla homologous sequences.

This iterative process combines properties mined from several sequence-and structure-based databases to determine the statistical likelihood of a replacement being benign to probably damaging (0.0-1.0 scale). Because PolyPhen-2 only operates with human protein sequences, we aligned our species' OAS1 primary structure to human OAS1.

Considering the level of conservation of OAS1 between monkeys and humans at the amino acid level, it seems justified to use the solved structure of human OAS1 (PDB ID: 4IG8) to confidently model and annotate residues in the old world monkeys. Though taxonomically distant, we also found it valuable to use the porcine OAS1 (pOAS1) crystal structure (PDB ID: 1PX5), as it shares the overall structural fold (73 % pairwise, 86 % BLOSUM64 identity) and provides a template for modeling OAS1 without bound RNA.

A significant fraction of SNPs are found at relatively high frequency (>0.25) in both species (13 and 12 SNPs in rhesus and Fish and Boissinot cynomolgus, respectively), but within each species, a large number of private SNPs were detected: 22 in cynomolgus and 14 in rhesus. However, many of those SNPs that are private within species are in fact shared between species so that the actual number of singletons in macaques is 12 in cynomolgus and 3 in rhesus. The large number of private SNPs accounts for slightly negative, though non-significant, values for Tajima's D (Table 1) in both species.

In both the rhesus and the cynomolgus macaque, we found that variation at OAS1 significantly exceeds what is expected given the divergence between macaque and human, confirming the balancing selection hypothesis (P=0.001). It should be noted that the neutral regions of reference were sequenced in a geographically diverse sample of macaques; it is thus unlikely that neutral variation is underestimated when compared with OAS1 variation.

Residue 27 participates in direct electrostatic binding to the docked RNA backbone, and the R27L mutation conveys significant electrostatic and hydrophobicity changes. PolyPhen-2, however, does not classify this change as damaging, possibly because leucine occupies this site in the hOAS2 and hOAS3 paralogs. For the H32R polymorphism, the surface electrostatic profile change appears quite dramatic as the arginine creates a far more electropositive surface than the histidine side group.

They can presumably participate in RNA binding because of their proximity to docked RNA and because of the flexibility of the linker. P52 is highly conserved across taxa, but the threonine replacement would presumably allow for increased interaction with docked RNA by increasing the linker's overall flexibility. Residue 54 participates in direct binding to RNA, and it is surprisingly variable within primates despite the otherwise high degree of conservation at this position amongst non-primates, as suggested by a BLASTP search. The surface electrostatics shows a significant effect of this polymorphism since R54 yields a broad electropositive surface to the protein while cysteine has a neutral effect. In addition, replacements at sites 52 and 54 may have an effect on residue S56, which binds directly to RNA nucleobase G17. The role of G17 is noteworthy because point mutation of G17 has been shown to decrease OAS1 activation 30-fold (Donovan et al. 2013) . Presumably, even a small degree of interference with S56's hydroxyl group would alter activation. G163D (Fig. 5d) is located in a pliant and extensive linker between the N-and C-lobes (Fig.  5) . The solved structure identifies only Q160 in this immediate region as contributing to RNA binding (via three hydrogen bonds).

Negatively charged D198 can interfere with the electropositive character of the region conferred by R197 and K201. Immediately neighboring N198D is R197, a key player in conformational change, the side group of which exchanges position with that of K66 when RNA docks. This exchange is one of the major reconfigurations required for the active site to become functional (Donovan et al. 2013 ). However, we predict that N198D would not negatively impact this essential interchange because our structural and kinetic models show that its side group, before and after binding, is oriented external to the deep groove in which the conformational change physically occurs.

Of the many amino acid polymorphisms we identified in macaque OAS1, we do not have replacements predicted to disrupt any \u03b1-helices or \u03b2-sheets. We also found no polymorphic amino acids in our models with R-groups facing internally. Though macaque haplotypes do contain replacements with large hydrophobicity shifts, the position of each of these is located in superficial linkers or loops where they are least likely to interfere with known enzyme structure or function. This absence of harmful mutations is consistent with an evolutionary history of purifying selection at sites important for the activation and enzymatic activity of OAS1.",

We found that the level of variation differs considerably among taxa. OAS1 exhibits a level of polymorphism far greater than the genomic average in macaques. Using the HKA test, we validated the hypothesis that this remarkably high level of variation is caused by balancing selection. We further showed that the region of the protein that interacts directly with viruses, the RNAbinding domain, contains a number of polymorphisms likely to affect the RNA-binding affinity of OAS1. These mutations however do not result in large surface electrostatic changes that would inhibit RNA binding and activation, and we did not observe mutations that would compromise essential enzymatic function and structure. Together, these lines of evidence strongly suggest that pathogen-driven balancing selection acting on the RBD is Fish and Boissinot maintaining variation at this locus. In contrast, OAS1 in baboons exhibits a level of polymorphism comparable to, or lower than, the genomic average, suggesting that the selective pressure acting on OAS1 differs greatly between these two primate genera.",

In addition, selective sweeps of favorable alleles or drastic reductions in population size can erase the signature of balancing selection; thus, balanced polymorphisms are predicted to be transient, and long-term balancing selection exceedingly rare (Charlesworth 2006 ). Yet, recent studies in human have emphasized the importance of balancing selection as an efficient mechanism to maintain variation in populations (reviewed in Key et al. 2014) , particularly at immunity genes. The most famous and best documented example of balancing selection concerns genes of the MHC system where alleles have been maintained in populations for millions of years, resulting in trans-specific polymorphisms (Klein et al. 1993; Lawlor et al. 1988; Mayer et al. 1988 ). In recent years, candidate gene analyses as well as genome-wide searches have identified additional loci that have evolved under balancing selection, including the ABO blood group (Leffler et al. 2013) , the antiretroviral TRIM5 gene (Cagliani et al. 2010) , and the CCR5 gene (Bamshad et al. 2002) . It has even been proposed that balancing selection is the main evolutionary force acting on innate immunity genes (Ferrer-Admetlla et al. 2008), a category of genes OAS1 belongs to.",

Comparable to what we find in macaques, chimpanzee OAS1 contains an extremely high level of polymorphism that far exceeds the genomic average as well as an excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms. Furthermore, a number of polymorphic sites appeared to fall conspicuously in the RBD (Ferguson et al. 2012) . In order to see if any of the replacement sites in macaque were shared with chimpanzee, we aligned the primary protein sequences as well as the structural models. The two main groups of alleles in chimpanzee differ by 15 polymorphic amino acids. Seven of these sites (28, 54, 96, 128, 163, 244, and 337) are also polymorphic in macaque. Surprisingly, six of these residues are polymorphic for exactly the same amino acids, including three RBD sites (28, 54, and 163), two of which (28 and 54) were identified as selected sites by Mozzi et al. (2015) . Another five polymorphic amino acids in macaque immediately neighbor residues that are polymorphic in chimpanzee. The similarity between macaque and chimpanzee is demonstrated on Fig. 6 , which shows RBD polymorphisms side by side. The similarity between these two primate taxa is striking and could suggest that these polymorphisms have been maintained by long-term balancing selection since macaque and chimpanzee split. This is however very unlikely since macaque and chimpanzee otherwise differ by 15 fixed amino acids and phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that chimpanzee and macaque alleles are reciprocally monophyletic (not shown). Instead, the similarity between chimpanzees and macaques represent an interesting case of convergent polymorphism.",

Second, we did not find evidence for linkage disequilibrium in Fish and Boissinot macaque whereas very strong linkage, suggestive of epistatic interactions, was found in chimpanzee between mutations in exons 1, 3, and 4. Although differences in recombination rate could account for this pattern, it is more likely to reflect a difference in the age of the balanced polymorphism. Multi-locus selection takes a long time to generate linkage disequilibrium (Hedrick 2010) , and Tajima's D fails to detect balancing selection if selection is too recent (Garrigan and Hedrick 2003) .

            "text": "Since balancing selection has played such a significant role in the evolution of OAS1, it is somewhat surprising that we did not find any evidence for it in baboons. Two processes could have erased the signature of balancing selection in these species. First, a diversityreducing demographic event, such as a population bottleneck, could have eliminated allelic diversity at OAS1. This is a possibility for the Guinea baboon, a species characterized by a remarkably low level of genetic variation (Boissinot et al. 2014) . It is however very unlikely to be the case in olive baboons since this form has maintained a relatively large effective population size for most of its history (Boissinot et al. 2014 ). Second, a selective sweep resulting in the fixation of a highly favorable allele could have occurred in the ancestor of baboons. When compared to macaque, there are only three derived mutations that are fixed or nearly fixed in baboons at residues T24R, H25R, and Y51S. Residues 24 and 25 belong to the \u03b1-helix N3, which participates in the RBD, and residue 24 was shown to interact directly with the RNA ligand (Donovan et al. 2013) . The fixation of a positively charged arginine in place of an uncharged threonine is undoubtedly a highly significant change that could have affected drastically the RNA-binding affinity of the baboon OAS1. Interestingly, residue 24 is polymorphic in chimpanzee (T/K) (Ferguson et al. 2012) and was identified as a site under positive selection in this species (Mozzi et al. 2015) . The replacement at residue 25 is unlikely to have much effect since the sidegroup ostensibly orients away from the RBD and a mutation from arginine to histidine is a conservative change. The change from the hydrophobic tyrosine to the uncharged serine at position 51 could also have a functional impact due to its proximity to a group of six residues (residues 54 to 60) that bind directly to the RNA ligand. We speculate that an episode of positive directional selection acting on one of these three sites (or on a combination of them) could have erased the signature of balancing selection in baboons. This hypothesis will however require experimental validation.",

            "text": "The mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of balanced polymorphism at OAS1 remain unclear but could include heterozygote advantage (if heterozygotes are better protected against viral pathogens), frequency-dependent selection, or selection that varies in space and/or time. Whatever the exact mechanism, the persistence of amino acid polymorphisms, in particular at the RBD, strongly suggests that OAS1 alleles differ in their RNA-binding activity, most likely to achieve optimal recognition of specific viral RNAs. The RNA-binding specificity of OAS1 implied by our evolutionary analysis is not consistent with early molecular studies, which suggested that OAS1 is a non-specific sensor of viral infection, and with the involvement of the OAS1/RNase L pathway against a wide diversity of viral infection (Silverman 2007) . More recent studies however have shown differential binding and activation of OAS1 based on RNA sequence, RNA secondary structure, or presence of 3\u2032 single-stranded pyrimidine motifs (Deo et al. 2014; Hartmann et al. 1998; Fish and Boissinot Kodym et al. 2009; Vachon et al. 2015) . The dsRNA consensus sequences NNWW(N) n WGN (Kodym et al. 2009 ), AYAY(N) n CC, and UU(N) n ACCC (Hartmann et al. 1998 ) have been identified experimentally, and it was shown that single or double SNPs in RNA ligands could alter OAS1 activation by degrees of magnitude. This is compelling evidence that minor changes to RNA sequences or to the RBD can profoundly affect OAS1's antiviral response. It is thus plausible that the polymorphisms we identified can confer some level of specificity to different viral species. The present analysis, together with previous studies in chimpanzees and other mammals (Ferguson et al. 2012; Mozzi et al. 2015) , provides a collection of candidate amino acids for future functional studies aimed at determining the molecular basis of the binding specificity of OAS1.
