            "text": "Immunization is an effective method against the re-emergence of SARS. Recently developed SARS vaccines have shown effectiveness in animal models and some clinical trials [1] [2] [3] . However, owing to the very low incidence of SARS infection since 2004, it could be very costly to vaccinate a large susceptible population. A more reasonable, rapid and cost-effective alternative under these circumstances could be the implementation of passive immunotherapy, in which human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) would play a key role in prevention and treatment. Neutralizing mAbs have demonstrated efficacy as a prophylaxis against a variety of viral infections [4] . Currently, some neutralizing mAbs to SARS have been tested in animal models and were proven to be effective in protecting against SARS-coronavirus (CoV) infection [5, 6] . This has made it possible to use passive transfer of neutralizing mAbs to prevent the quick spread of SARS-CoV in the case of regional outbreak. However, a key task involves understanding their underlying mechanisms of action.",

In the present study, the authors have focused on understanding the antiviral mechanisms of these mAbs. To accomplish this, they first developed a receptor binding inhibition assay with Vero E6 cells naturally expressing the receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2, to detect the inhibition of mAbs to viral attachment. Each of the 19 previously identified S1-specific mAbs was preincubated with a purified protein expressing S1 of SARS-CoV fused with Fc of human IgG (S12-510-Fc). This was then added to Vero E6 cells and detection of protein binding in the presence of mAbs to the target cell surface via flow cytometry was performed. Their results demonstrated that 18 of these anti-S1 mAbs, designated as group 1, recognized seven distinct epitopes within the RBD and that all were capable of efficiently inhibiting S12-510-Fc protein binding. These findings suggest that the mechanism of these group 1 mAbs might involve the inhibition of SARS-CoV infection by blocking viral attachment to the cellular receptor of target cells [8] .",

The authors have demonstrated that combining such mAbs, which target distinct epitopes, may greatly increase inhibition of virus infection and suppress the generation of neutralization escape mutants. The inhibition of human mAbs to SARS-coronavirus (CoV) may also act through different mechanisms of action, depending on their target epitopes or regions. Therefore, this approach could provide fast and effective prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV infection during a SARS outbreak. Specifically, Coughlin et al. have indicated that most of the tested anti-S1 mAbs recognized epitopes within the receptor-binding domain and blocked virus attachment to its cellular receptor. These findings could provide a further step in understanding the mechanism of these mAbs in the prevention of SARS-CoV infection, as well as an insight into the design and development of novel therapeutic treatments.",

This mAb was designated as 4D4, belonging to group 2 mAbs binding upstream of RBD. Thus, the authors generated a pseudovirus system containing HIV backbone and expressing the SARS-CoV S protein (HIV/S), and used it to examine the ability of mAb 4D4 to inhibit viral entry. The pseudovirus was bound to 293T/T17 cells transiently transfected with human receptor ACE2 at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, allowing viral attachment (binding), but not entry. Then the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of mAb 4D4 and incubated at 37\u00b0C until luciferase activity was detected. This way, Coughlin et al. demonstrated that mAb 4D4 inhibited a postbinding step in viral entry and that such postbinding inhibition was significantly greater than that indicated by direct preincubation of pseudovirus with mAb before adding to the target cells [8] . Therefore, this mAb might prevent the conformational change necessary for S protein cleavage by cathepsin.",

Their results revealed that all these mAb combinations demon strated a significant increase in inhibition. A similar increase of protection was detected by combining mAbs 4D4 and 3C7 to neutralize live SARS-CoV (Urbani) infection in Vero E6 cells [8] . These results suggest that combining antibodies containing distinct epitopes and neutralizing virus with different mechanisms may result in a greater inhibition of virus infection.",

They found that escape mutants emerged in the presence of nine of the 11 mAbs at different passages of virus culture, suggesting that these mAbs possessed different abilities in selecting escape mutants when used individually.

Some human mAbs to SARS-CoV have been evaluated in animal models and demon strated efficacy. Human mAb 80R, for example, may largely reduce viral replication when given as a prophylaxis to mice at doses therapeutically achievable in humans [11] . According to Roberts et al., therapy with neutralizing human mAb 201 to SARS-CoV reduced disease severity and viral burden in Golden Syrian hamsters [5] .

Most of the mAbs targeting epitopes within RBD, as reported by Coughlin et al. and others [8, 14] , interfere with virus-receptor inter actions by blocking attachment of the virus to the target cells, thus providing protection from SARS-CoV replication. Some other mAbs, as tested by Coughlin et al. in this study, target the S1 domain upstream of RBD by inhibiting viral entry through a postbinding event. Since human mAbs inhibit SARS-CoV infection by different mechanisms, combining mAbs with various mechanisms of inhibition and targeting multiple antigenic epitopes may induce additive or synergistic effect, largely reducing the possibility that neutralization escape mutants can be generated. Studies by Rockx et al. have indicated that a cocktail of three mAbs (S109.8, S227.14 and S230.15), which target distinct epitopes, completely protected aged mice against weight loss and virus replication in the lungs following lethal challenge of a live SARS-CoV icHC/SZ/61/03, minimizing the likely generation of escape mutants [10] .",

However, caution should be taken when using neutralizing human mAbs as an immunoprophylaxis strategy, in which a genotyping surveillance of SARS-CoV-like genotypes in known animal reservoirs might be required [11] . It should be noted that passive transfer of antibodies may be less efficient in protecting immunosenescent populations than young populations.
