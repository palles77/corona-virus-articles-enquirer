Abstract 25 Background: In Korea, a total of 8,799 confirmed cases of COVID-19 including 102 deaths have been 26 recorded as of Mar 21, 2020. The time-delay adjusted case fatality risk of COVID-19 in Korea is yet to be 27 estimated. 28 29 Methods: We obtained the daily series of confirmed cases and deaths in Korea reported prior to March 21, 30 2020. Using statistical methods, we estimated the time-delay adjusted risk for death from COVID-19 in the 31 city of Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do, other regions in Korea, as well as for the entire country. 32 33 Results: Our model-based crude CFR fitted the observed data well throughout the course of the epidemic 34 except for the very early stage in Gyeongsangbuk-do, partially due to the reporting delay. Our estimates of 35 the risk for death in Gyeongsangbuk-do reached 2.4% (95% CrI: 1.6-3.4%), 1.3% (95% CrI: 1.0-1.6%) in 36 Daegu and 0.7% (95% CrI: 0.3-1.4%) in other regions, whereas the national estimate of the risk for death 37 was estimated at 1.4% (95% CrI: 1.2-1.7%) in Korea. 38 39 Conclusions: The relatively low CFRs are associated with the early implementation of public health 40 interventions including widespread testing, social distancing, and delayed school openings in Korea. 41 Geographic differences in CFR are likely influenced by clusters of nosocomial transmission. 42 43",

Specifically, we have estimated time-delay adjusted CFR in three different 154 geographic areas in Korea and found that the most severely affected areas were Gyeongsangbuk-do while 155 the rest of Korea exhibits milder severity impact. Specifically, the delay-adjusted CFR in Gyeongsangbuk-156 do, largely driven by hospital-based transmission, was relatively high, being estimated at 2.4% (95% CrI: 157 1.6-3.4%), which is about 2-fold higher than our estimate for Daegu and for all regions in Korea.

In general, the CFR 175 of the same disease might vary greatly in different countries or even different regions of the same country, 176 partially due to differences in health control policies, availability of healthcare, medical standards, and 177 detection efficiency.

Such 180 extensive testing might have effectively identified COVID-19 cases even with mild symptoms, thus 181 lowering the CFR. 182The reported CFR of COVID-19 tends to vary over the course of epidemic curve. It is noteworthy 183 that the upward trend of CFR during the early phase generally indicates increasing ascertainment bias.184 During a growing epidemic the final clinical outcomes of most reported cases are unknown, and thus 185 underestimating the true CFR early in the epidemic. Such effect was observed in our results (Fig. 2) as well 186 as in prior studies of past epidemics of respiratory pathogens including SARS and H1N1 influenza [30, 31]. 187 Similarly, the observed time lag between onset of symptoms and outcomes tends to bias the estimated CFR 188 downwards during the early growth phase of an epidemic. 189 When the transmission of COVID-19 was widely recognized by clusters of confirmed cases such 190 as hospital-based transmission, surveillance is typically biased towards detecting clinically severe cases, 191 therefore resulting in higher CFR estimates. Specifically, hospital-based transmission has occurred during 192 the outbreak of COVID-19 in Korea, including clusters based in Cheongdo Daenam Hospital (resulting in 193 120 infections), Hansarang Convalescent Hospital (75 infections) and Gyeongsan Seo Convalescent 194 Hospital (30 infections) in Gyeongsangbuk-do, which explains our higher CFR estimate at 2.4% (95% CrI: 195 1.6-3.4%) for Gyeongsangbuk-do. Similarly, nosocomial clusters also occurred in Bundang Je-saeng 196 Hospital (38 infections) in Gyeonggi province, KimSin Recuperation Hospital (26 infections) in Daegu, 197 and Eunpyeong St Mary's Hospital (14 infections) in Seoul [5]. Such hospital-based transmission resulted 198 infections affecting healthcare workers, inpatients and their visitors, which tend to elevate 199 CFR estimates as has been previously documented for outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome 200 (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome in the past [32, 33]. In addition, a large number of COVID-201 19 cases are related to church clusters in Korea, including a total of 5,037 COVID-19 cases in a cluster 202 linked to the Shincheonji Church, accounting for about 57% of all confirmed cases [5]. 203 Asymptomatic patients complicate the estimation of CFR for COVID-19. In fact, the transmission 204 of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic individuals (or individuals within the incubation period) has also been 205 described [34-36]. For instance, in a COVID-19 outbreak on a cruise ship, about half of the 619 confirmed 206 COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [37]. Moreover, some of patients with 207 asymptomatic infection showed objective clinical abnormalities. In a previous study of 24 patients with 208 asymptomatic infection and their chest computed tomography (CT), 50 percent of those had typical ground-209 glass opacities or patchy shadowing, and another 20 percent had atypical imaging abnormalities [38]. In 210 addition, it is likely that asymptomatic or very mild cases were not reported, and thus were not included in 211 our analysis, possibly overestimating our CFR. Future research and more accurate incidence data including 212 age-stratified serologic studies would improve our estimates. 213 During the course of the epidemic, estimates of the time-adjusted CFR for Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-214 do, other regions (outside Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do) as well as all regions in Korea showed a declining 215 trend. A downward trend in time-adjusted CFR after its peak suggests the extent of improvement in 216 epidemiologic surveillance. In addition, a downward trend in CFR is partially due to a substantial number 217 of mild or asymptomatic cases, which might prolong the end of the outbreak [18]. We note that a similar 218 trend was previously reported for the COVID-19 outbreak in China, and for the 2015 MERS outbreak in 219 South Korea.",

            "text": "Assessing the severity of infection of COVID-19 is useful to anticipate the risk of death during the 73 course of the epidemic as well as hypothesize factors that may be driving the risk of death in different 74 geographic areas. The crude case fatality risk (CFR) can be measured by estimating the proportion of the 75 cumulative number of deaths out of the cumulative number of cases at a point in time, which underestimates 76 severity due to the real-time nature of the growth in the number of fatal cases. This is due to the delays from 77 case notification to death. On the other hand, the denominator is calculated based on confirmed cases only, 78 and thus may overestimate the actual CFR based on all infected individuals, resulting in ascertainment bias. 79Nevertheless, Korea has instituted broad scale testing efforts at the core of the control interventions[15]. Therefore, the present study aims to estimate the risk of death among confirmed cases while addressing 81 ascertainment bias and a right-censored likelihood for modeling the count of deceased cases by using 82established methods [16]. In order to estimate the current severity of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea, we 83 report the estimates of the time-delay adjusted CFR for COVID-19 for the city of Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-84 do, Other regions (i.e., outside Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do) and for Korea, with quantified uncertainty. 85 We obtained the daily series of confirmed cases and deaths in Korea from daily reports published by the 89 Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) [5]. These data were categorized by geographic 90 area: Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Other regions, or Korea, considering that over 70% of the deaths are 91 occurring in Daegu. The virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, is detected by reverse-92 transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and according to the Center for Laboratory Control of 93 Infectious Diseases in KCDC, the upper limit of Ct value for positive RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 is 35, and 94 the negative criterion is Ct value 37 or higher [17]. Our analysis relies on epidemiological data reported 95 specific point in time. For the estimation of CFR in real time, we employ the delay from hospitalization to 100 death, hs, which is assumed to be given by hs = H(s) -H(s-1) for s>0 where H(s) is a cumulative density 101 function of the delay from hospitalization to death and follows a gamma distribution with mean 10.1 days 102 and SD 5.4 days, according to a recent study that estimated the CFR in China [18]. We let \u03c0a,ti be the time-103 delay adjusted case fatality ratio on reported day ti in area a. The likelihood function of the estimate \u03c0a,ti is 104",

The second 166 youngest case-patient was a 40-year old male with hypertension who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after 167 death [24]. Besides these two cases, all deaths associated with COVID-19 in Korea occurred among 168 individuals of age over 50. Such age-dependency of COVID-19 fatality indicates the importance of 169 monitoring infected individuals with old age and/or underlying medical conditions. 170 Our estimate time-adjusted CFR associated with COVID-19 in all regions in Korea is 1.4% (95% 171 CI: 1.2-1.7%).
