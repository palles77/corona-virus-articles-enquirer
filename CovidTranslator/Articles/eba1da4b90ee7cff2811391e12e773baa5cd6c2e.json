Remdesivir was tested in 5 trials with a median of 400 (IQR, 394-453) planned inclusions per trial, while stem cells therapy was tested in 23 trials, but had a median of 40 (IQR, 23-60) planned inclusions per trial. Lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with the highest total number of planned inclusions (2606) followed by remdesivir (2155). Only 52% of the clinical trials reported the treatment dose (n=60) and only 34% (n=39) the duration.

Patients were linked to Huanan market, selling fish and other live animals. On January 7 th , 2020 the Chinese health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) officially announced the discovery of a novel coronavirus, currently called SARS-CoV-2. 1 The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named COVID-19. On January 30 th , WHO declared the epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On March 11 th , WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Up to March the 18 th , more than 200,000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 8,000 deaths have been reported in the world. The COVID-19 epidemic is unique because of its scale, the speed of its spread, the lack of pre-existing scientific data and the importance of media and scientific coverage. 2 The scientific and public health community have responded with early publication of clinical data and predictions of spread and guidance for effective containment. 3, 4 Alongside, and critically, health professionals need to find effective and safe treatment for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

Integrating clinical trials of experimental therapeutics is an increasingly recognized part of the response during infectious disease outbreaks. Since the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and subsequent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo, clinical trials of investigative drugs have been fully integrated in the epidemic response. [5] [6] [7] The COVID-19 pandemic is unique because of its scale, the speed of its spread, the lack of pre-existing scientific data and the importance of media and scientific coverage. 2 To encourage the development of clinical trials that test therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, the WHO has suggested a number of candidate antiviral agents that have to be tested in clinical trials. 8 Concomitantly, numerous clinical trials have been registered since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak numerous to evaluate therapeutic strategies for this disease. In the epidemic context, it is crucial for clinicians and researchers to have access to rapid and quality information on clinical trials that the various teams around the world are setting up. The results will inform about the antiviral agents that are used, their dosing and duration, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients, the outcomes that will be evaluated, as well as the design of the clinical trials. We believe that it is essential to carry out a review of these early phase clinical trials before the results are even available in order to best inform the teams wishing to test new therapies, choose therapeutic candidates or to design clinical trials.",

A first search was conducted on February 28 th , 2020 on all registries listed above to capture the studies registered from November 2019; and an updated search was conducted on March 7 th , 2020 on clinicaltrials.gov to capture additional studies registered since February 28 th . Our search strategy was designed to identify all the clinical trials using antiviral agents that were registered for COVID-19. The following search terms were used for our search to capture relevant studies: \"2019-nCoV\", \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"Hcov-19\", \"new coronavirus\", \"novel coronavirus\".

Most of the agents evaluated in clinical trials have shown an in vitro antiviral activity, sometimes including coronaviruses. Lopinavir/ritonavir is tested in 15 clinical trials in this review. This combination has shown an in vitro activity against SARS-CoV in several studies 15 and appears to have activity against MERS-CoV in animal studies 16 . The use of this agent for treatment of COVID-19 has been described in case reports 17, 18 and in a case series of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore. 19 We found 18 clinical trials evaluating hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, whose mechanism of action is similar. 20 The in vitro antiviral activity of chloroquine has been known for a long time 21 and was described on a number of viruses including SARS-CoV. 22 However, chloroquine failed to demonstrate a benefit in the treatment of viral diseases such as influenza, dengue or chikungunya. [23] [24] [25] Regarding COVID-19, a recent publication reported an activity of chloroquine on SARS-CoV-2 26 and another encouraged the use of chloroquine for patients with COVID-19 on the basis of unreported clinical results. 27 Experts in China have suggested the use of chloroquine for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 but no clinical data has been provided yet to support this announcement. 28, 29 Remdesivir is evaluated in 5 clinical trials but with the highest median number of planned inclusions per trial. Studies in vitro in human airway epithelial cell assays demonstrated that remdesivir inhibits replication of coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV. 30 In mouse infection models, remdesivir had therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 30, 31 In a recent non-human primate study, remdesivir treatment initiated 12 hours post inoculation with MERS-CoV provided clinical benefit with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. 32, 33 The rationale of using stem cell therapy is based on its immunomodulatory properties that could be interesting in severe COVID-19. 34, 35 However, stem cell-based therapies have not demonstrated an effect in treating other viral diseases and the scientific background to test them is weak. The fact that stem cell therapy, that has not shown any effect in antiviral diseases, was one of the most frequently assessed therapies is unexpected. This highlights the fact that researchers should strive to conduct clinical trials with the most promising candidates, according to in vitro and preclinical in vivo scientific data.",

Our study underlines the need to register as much details as possible on clinical trials registries during outbreaks in order to inform the development of future trials. The scientific background supporting the use of a treatment should be clear and detailed as much as possible. The dose and duration of drugs evaluated, as well as details on the study design, the population of interest and the primary outcome, are crucial elements that have to be shared in the context of the epidemic response. Reporting as much details as possible is key to have consistent clinical trials and to enhance the reproducibility of the results, especially as studies are more often associated with a low number of planned inclusions and composite or weak outcomes that can limit the efficacy assessment of the treatments. That is why transparency and consistency are crucial when reporting clinical trials in order to improve statistical power by conducting, for example, meta-analyses.",
