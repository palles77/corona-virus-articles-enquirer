            "text": "Neonatal Diarrheal Disease is responsible for significant economic losses to the livestock industries in Canada and around the world. Microbes responsible are diverse and include Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Rotavirus, Coronavirus and Cryptosporidia. While the use of antibiotics as a treatment for bacterial infections and as a prophylactic additive in feed has dramatically improved cattle production in recent decades, the increasing pressure to reduce or eliminate use of antibiotics in animals has caused the livestock industry to seek appropriate alternatives. Antimicrobial/Host Defense Peptides are natural compounds present on skin and in secretions in plants and animals that are microbicidal for bacteria, viruses, and parasites and they stimulate the immune system to combat infectious diseases. Our objective is to establish orally-obtained Host Defense Peptides (HDPs) as an alternative to antibiotics to protect against Neonatal Diarrheal Disease in calves. We devised a method to allow the cow udder to act as a factory to produce HDPs so that suckling calves will receive a continuous oral dose of HDPs over several weeks to protect them against neonatal diarrhea. We will use Adenovirus to deliver a gene coding for several HDPs in-frame into mammary epithelial cells. The epithelial cells will secrete the HDP protein into milk to be consumed by the suckling calves and trypsin in the calf gut will release the HDPs through cleavage. Thus, the novelty of this research lies not only in the proposed alternative to antibiotics to protect neonates against disease, but in the method by which we introduce the peptides to the suckling offspring.",

Unlike antibiotics, HDPs are not disease-specific and can at once potentially protect against multiple bacterial, viral and parasitic challenges. In this report, we selected four HDPs (Indolicidin (Indol), Lactoferricin (LFn), Bovine Myeloid Antimicrobial Peptide-27 (BMAP-27), and Protegrin-1 (PG-1)) which have individually been shown to possess anti-microbial, antiinflammatory or immunomodulatory activities [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] .

However, adding synthetic peptides directly to feed or water as a prophylactic treatment and/or to treat disease is cost-prohibitive. To circumvent these costs, we devised a novel HDP delivery system: We intend to manipulate the cow's mammary glands to secrete significant quantities of select HDPs into milk using adenovirus gene delivery system. Through consumption of HDP-enriched milk, the calf will be supplemented with HDPs, which can then act directly as antimicrobial agents as well as influence the calf gastrointestinal immune system to protect against Neonatal Diarrheal Disease.",

Peptide chains were synthesized from the carboxyl terminus to the amino terminus onto [5-(4-Fmoc-aminomethyl-3,5dimethyloxyphenoxy) valeric acid]-polyethylene glycol-polystyrene (PAL-PEG-PS) resin (OVA (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd, Oakville, ON, Canada). Fmoc-protecting groups at the amino terminus were deprotected with piperidine. The peptides were cleaved from the resin with concurrent deprotection of the side chain-protecting groups by treating the resin-bound peptide with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Sigma) (9.3 parts) in the presence of scavengers (anisole-ethyl-methyl sulfide-1,2-ethanedithiol [3:3:1]), for 4 h. The crude peptides were filtered from the resin, and the TFA was evaporated. Diethyl ether (Sigma) was added to the residues to precipitate the crude peptide. The peptides were isolated and purified by highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on VYDAC \u00ae protein C 4 ",

Seventytwo hours later, supernatants were collected and frozen at -80 o C. Supernatants were evaporated by Speed-Vac to approximately 200 \u00b5l volume and 10 % was added to methanol-treated, dried, PVDF membrane. Five \u00b5g of 293 cellular supernatants which had previously been transfected with bacterial plasmid expressing FLAG (a kind gift from McFie and Stone [14] ) was also blotted onto the membrane and was allowed to dry at room temperature. The blot was blocked with 1 % skim milk in 0.05 %Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBST). TBST buffer for 1 hour. Primary rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (1 \u00b5g/ml; Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was incubated with the blot at room temperature with gentle shaking for 2 hr. After washing 3 times with 5 ml of 1% skim milk/TBST, the secondary Alkaline-phosphataseconjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature gentle shaking. Blots were washed 3 times with 1% skim milk in TBST for 5 minutes each followed by three washes in TBST. Blots were washed 4 times with ddH 2 O then 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT/BCIP) (Sigma) insoluble alkaline substrate solution was added as per manufacturer's instruction.",

Therefore, we sought to identify a cocktail of HDPs which are effective at low concentrations. We evaluated the microbicidal activity of Indol, LFn, BMAP-27, and PG-1 alone and in combination against an E. coli K99 bovine field isolate known to cause Neonatal Diarrheal Disease in cattle [10] . Individually and in the majority of combinations, Indol, LFn, BMAP-27, and PG-1 were poorly microbicidal at 1.5 \u00b5g/ml (Table 1) . However, when Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1-FLAG were introduced to the bacteria at 1.5 \u00b5g/ml each, the cocktail proved to be strongly anti-microbial. A trypan blue exclusion assay determined that even when Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 were at 12. 5 \u00b5g/ml, they were not cytotoxic to MAC-T cells (Table 2 ). Next, we evaluated the effect that Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 had on IL-8 protein expression, a chemokine known to induce both chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils [15, 16] and an indicator or innate immune activation. Although this experiment needs to be repeated to establish whether these results are statistically significant, Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 (1.5 \u00b5g/ml) prompted a moderate induction of IL-8 expression in MAC-T cells. In the presence of LPS, Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 showed a strongly synergistic effect with production of > 3,000 pg/ml IL-8 after 48 hours. Thus, we have chosen to clone Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 into adenovirus for further analysis.",

We designed a gene such that Indol's natural signal peptide sequence was in-frame to the active region of Indol which was also in-frame with the active sequences for LFn, BMAP-27, PG-1 and FLAG. Because there are no commercially available antibodies against Indol, LFn, BMAP-27 or PG-1, we included the FLAG epitope as part of the gene product. Detection of FLAG using anti-FLAG antibodies could be used to infer expression of Indol, LFn, BMAP-27 and PG-1. The gene was designed so that each HDP were separated from each other by four codons coding for Arginine. When translated into a protein, the HDPs will be freed from each other through trypsin digestion. This gene was synthesized as indicated in Materials and Methods and cloned into a CpG-free expression plasmid. In turn, the gene was sub-cloned into a replication defective adenovirus. When 293 cells were transduced with the modified adenovirus, we detected FLAG expression through dot-blot analysis suggesting that the peptides were also being expressed.",

The peptide cocktail synergized with LPS to promote robust quantities of IL-8 protein from MAC-T cells. Together, these results suggest that Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 are strongly immunomodulatory and anti-microbial. Our next steps will be to establish adenovirus-mediated expression of Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 in cow milk, and to determine whether it protect calves against Neonatal Diarrheal Disease. Supernatants were blotted onto PVDF membrane and hybridized with anti-FLAG antibody. Adenovirus transduced 293 cells expressed FLAG and therefore must also produce the HDP active regions. The active portion of Indol/LFn/BMAP-27 and PG-1 were cloned in-frame to an bacteriallike plasmid which was in turn be introduced to an adenovirus vector. The gene includes a sequence corresponding to the Sequence Recognition Particle (Signal) to ensure secretion of the protein outside of the cell and a FLAG tag for detection and quantification purposes. The adenovirus will be injected into the mammary tissue through the teat canal with the intent that it will transduce the mammary epithelial cells which will, in turn, generate the HDP protein into the milk. Upon consumption by the calf, the HDP protein will travel to the gut where trypsin will cleave the HDP protein to release the active peptides.
