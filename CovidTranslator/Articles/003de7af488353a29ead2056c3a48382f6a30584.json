The evaporative effect could be significant because an impressive number of droplets accumulated on the underside of the parafilm. The evaporative effect should not be countered by asserting that it would also happen during the drinking of wine at the table. Evaporation only increases the concentration but not the amount of lead actually ingested. I am concerned that press reports of Graziano and Blum's findings have led to unnecessary public concern about drinking from lead crystal, a practice the more affluent have done for decades with apparent impunity. They quote US Enviromental Protection Agency allowable limits for drinking water of 50 &micro;g/1 with a possible reduction to 20 (ig/1. Some wines used in their study were above the 20 &micro;g/1 at the start of the study. The level of increase seen in the glass leaching experiment (if not due to evaporation) could fade to insignificance beside the drinking of wine with a higher starting lead content. Wine is unlikely to be a important source of lead unless a lot is consumed,2 which is not the case if it is left in a glass for up to ",

Toroviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause enteric infections in animals-eg, horses (Berne virus, BEV)2 and cattle (Breda virus, BRV).3 A human sample was reported to agglutinate rat erythrocytes, and the reaction was inhibited by antisera from calves experimentally infected with BRV. Diagnostic techniques to detect toroviruses in clinical specimens include haemagglutination (HA) and haemagglutination-inhibition tests (HA/HI), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immune electronmicroscopy, and nucleic acid hybridisation. Direct electronmicroscopy of negatively-stained faeces is not reliable for diagnosis because of the pleomorphic appearance of toroviruses and their morphological resemblance with coronaviruses.",

Successful amplification was achieved with a set of primers homologous to the 3' ends of BEV and BRV RNA on nucleic acid extracted from two of the three hybridisation-positive human stools. These preliminary results suggest a high degree of sequence similarity between the 3' ends of genomic RNA from human, bovine, and equine toroviruses. Anaphylactic reaction to ampicillin and severe complication in the fetus SIR,&mdash;Anaphylaxis is a fairly uncommon event in pregnancy that can have serious implications for both mother and fetus. Several central nervous system damage in the preterm fetus and death in infancy have been attributed to maternal hypotensive anaphylaxis whereas at term the fetus has been regarded as protected. 1-3 A case of severe anaphylaxis to ampicillin during labour with good fetal outcome has lately been described. ' We report a severe fetal complication after intravenous application of ampicillin to a woman at term. A 42-year-old woman, gravida 4, para 2, was admitted with premature rupture of membranes at 40 weeks' gestation. Since cervix score was low and no uterine contractions were noted we decided to wait until spontaneous onset of labour. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy with 2 g of ampicillin was prescribed to prevent intra-amniotic infection. 5 minutes after administration the patient complained of itching, burning, and nausea associated with pronounced skin flushing and a fall in blood pressure from 130/70 to 85/50 mm Hg. She received glucocorticoids, calcium, and antihistamines and recovered immediately. Fetal heart rate was monitored after this reaction and a smooth sine wave-line baseline with a frequency of about 100 beats per minute was seen. Concomitantly the onset of uterine contractions began and tocolytic therapy was therefore initiated and caesarean section was done. A male infant weighing 3150 g was delivered, with Apgar scores of 3, 6, and 7 at 1,5, and 10 minutes, respectively, and severe metabolic acidosis (arterial cord blood pH 671). He was intubated and",
