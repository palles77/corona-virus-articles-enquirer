Siblings were counted when living in the same household as the study participant. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure was defined as positive if there was at least one parent smoking tobacco in the same household. Data on nutrition including breastfeeding were collected throughout the first year of life in weekly telephone interviews.",

In summary, after DNA extraction the variable regions V3 to V5 of bacterial 16S rRNA gene were amplified by using the multiplex identifier tagged primer pair 341F/907R. After elution of the PCR reactions by 40 \u00b5L of doubledistilled water, the concentration was measured with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Basel, Switzerland). Amplification products with a concentration of less than 1.0 ng/\u00b5L which corresponds to less than 1 pg/\u00b5L bacterial DNA were excluded from this study according to recent recommendations (6) . Samples were pooled using 40 ng/ \u00b5L of purified PCR product, resulting in 8 amplicon pools labelled with unique multiplex identifiers. The reads from 454 Titanium amplicon sequencing were submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (accession number PRJEB20454). The average number of reads is 1246.6 with a SD 684.0. There were only 7/334 samples with less than 250 reads. Bacterial density was described as the concentration of PCR product within a sample.",

The relative abundances of the five most frequent bacterial families with the remaining families grouped together as \"Others\" were used as input variables for clustering of both swabs. The optimal number of clusters was determined by Silhouette index (9) and KL index (10) for both swabs. Both indices suggested 6 clusters for swab A. Since the sixth cluster was too small for phenotyping purposes (n = 2 infants), it was thus excluded from the study, resulting in five clusters, including 165 infants. For swab B, KL index suggested five clusters and Silhouette index suggested seven clusters. Also taking into account the clusters' sizes, the optimal cluster number for swab B was six. However, as the last three clusters were too small for phenotyping purposes (n \u2264 6 infants), they were not considered for the current study, resulting in three clusters, including 155 infants. The clustering was also validated with the K-means clustering method, which resulted in similar cluster numbers and classes for both swabs.",
