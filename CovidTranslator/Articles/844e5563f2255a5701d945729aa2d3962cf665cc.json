In susceptible individuals this inflammation causes symptoms which are usually associated with widespread, but variable, airflow obstruction that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment, and causes an associated increase in airway responsiveness to a variety of stimuli.\" The interaction of these features determines the clinical manifestations and severity of the disease and the response to treatment [3] . How these features relate to each other, how they are best measured, and how they contribute to clinical manifestations of the disease remains unclear. Age of disease onset also complicates understanding, although there are many shared features in the diagnosis of asthma in children and in adults, there are also important differences. The differential diagnosis, the natural history of wheezing illnesses, and the ability to perform certain investigations are all influenced by age [4] .",

Worldwide, deaths from asthma have reached more than 180,000 annually. Overall, asthma affects 5-10% of the population in many developed countries. One study found that the annual estimated incidence of physician-diagnosed asthma ranged from 0.6-29.5 per 1000 persons. Risk factors for incident asthma among children include male gender, atopic sensitization, parental history of asthma, early-life stressors and infections, obesity, and exposure to indoor allergens, tobacco smoke, and outdoor pollutants. Risk factors for adult-onset asthma include female sex, airway hyper-responsiveness, lifestyle factors, and work-related exposures.",

Although the costs of asthma care vary by country, it is estimated that worldwide the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost from asthma is about 15 million per year. Worldwide asthma accounts for around 1% of all DALYs lost, which reflects the high prevalence and severity of asthma. The number of asthmacaused lost DALYs is similar to that for diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver, and schizophrenia. Costs are related to other factors, including asthma control, demographics, medical history, and doses of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) prescribed [6] . Improving asthma control is associated with decreased cost.",

It estimated the resulting net benefit associated with compliance to be \u00a32250 per patient, with a reduction in expected annual treatment costs of approximately \u00a375 per patient per year. Based on an asthma point prevalence of 5.8%, the findings suggest that there are almost 1.8 million asthmatics in the United Kingdom who are noncompliant. If interventions were available to change the behavior of all partially compliant medicine users to raise the percentage to 80% or more, the report estimated that over \u00a3130 million in treatment cost savings could be realized in the United Kingdom alone.

Several trials have evaluated the role of macrolide antibiotics in treating and preventing asthma exacerbations. One study randomized adults with exacerbations to the ketolide antibiotic telithromycin or placebo; the telithromycin group had a small but significant improvement in symptoms and lung function from exacerbation to the end of treatment [18] . Further studies of macrolide antibiotics (which have immunomodulatory as well as antibiotic properties) are under way, but as yet macrolide antibiotics are not recommended by international asthma guidelines. New techniques for assessing the airway bacterial microbiota have established that the airways are not normally sterile, and may permit the role of bacterial infection in airways disease to be further delineated. A recent study found that pathogenic Proteobacteria, particularly Haemophilus species, were much more frequent in the bronchi of patients with asthma or COPD than in controls [19] .",

Exposure to allergens-for example, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus 1 (Der p1) and Dactylis glomerata (Dacg1)-originating from various sources, including pollen, house dust mite, and mold, are taken up by dendritic cells, B-lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and macrophages, which present the antigens to T-lympocytes. This activates the T-lymphocytes to produce cytokines that regulate immunoglobulin E (IgE) production by the B-lymphocytes. Bound IgE activates mast cells in the airways. Activated mast cells initially release a number of factors, including IL4, leukotrienes, and histamine, that cause airway hyper-responsiveness and result in an early response to allergen stimulus via bronchoconstriction. The concurrent release of cytokines and chemokines from the mast cell recruits eosinophils, basophils, and T-lymphocytes to the airway. These cells, in association with T cell-activated neutrophils and with antigen stimulated macrophages, release chemokines and leukotrienes over an extended period of time, resulting in a late response to allergen stimulus via bronchoconstriction. Prolonged stimulation of the late-response factors ultimately leads to the airway structural changes such as mucus hypersecretion, myofibroblast, and airway smooth-muscle proliferation, which are common to the asthmatic lung. and it continues to improve exponentially with initiatives such as the 100,000 Genomes project, which aims to genome-sequence this number of UK subjects, and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements Consortium (ENCODE), an initiative to identify the genome's regulatory regions. Recent figures suggest that more than 6.9 million singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or single-base-pair changes exist in a genome consisting of 3 billion base pairs. Similarly there is a growing realization that deletions, insertions, and expansions of tandem repeats also represent significant variation. These genetic polymorphisms are found throughout the genome and have the potential to influence gene function in several ways leading to human disease: (1) a coding-region nonsynonymous polymorphism can alter the amino acid sequence and structure/function of the protein; (2) a polymorphism can introduce a stop codon leading to the production of a nonfunctional protein; and (3) a polymorphism in a regulatory region can regulate the expression levels of a gene.",

            "text": "It has long been known that atopic diseases such as asthma run in families. In 1916, using 621 atopic probands and 76 nonatopic controls and their respective families, it was shown that 48.4% of atopic probands had a family history of atopy, compared with 14.5% in the control population [39] . Similarly, a study of 176 families showed a very high concordance of asthma, hayfever, and eczema in parents and children [40] . Twin studies have been useful in identifying a significant concordance of asthma that is higher in monozygotic twins (identical genotype) versus dizygotic twins (on average sharing half of their genes). In the largest study to date, using 11,688 Danish twin pairs, it was suggested that 73% of susceptibility to asthma was genetic, with a substantial environmental component [41] . More recent studies suggest hereditability estimates of 35-95% for asthma [42] . Therefore, asthma is considered a complex genetic disorder and, in contrast to single-gene disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis), involves multiple genes, with expression influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Multiple environmental factors are important in asthma development, including tobacco smoke exposure, respiratory viral infections, antibiotic use, diet, and allergen exposure. Gender and ethnic background also make a significant contribution. This complex mode of inheritance combined with the heterogeneity in the presentation of the disease has made gene discovery a challenge. Early studies investigated inheritance through families containing multiple affected children, using linkage analyses and candidate gene approaches based on biology or location in the genome. However, the FIGURE 28.2 Asthmatic airway pathology. This schematic comparison of a normal airway with that observed in severe chronic asthma indicates histological changes that accompany recurring inflammation seen over time. Unlike that from the unaffected individual, the bronchial mucosa from the severe asthmatic displays thickening of the basement membrane, airway smooth-muscle hypertrophy, leukocyte infiltration, epithelial cell desquamation, goblet cell hyperplasia in the epithelial lining accompanied by mucus hypersecretion, and plugging of the bronchial lumen, as well as edema and collagen deposition in the submucosal area.

Human studies have identified elevated numbers of cells expressing IL13 mRNA in the bronchial tissue of atopic and nonatopic asthmatic subjects [50] ; administration of recombinant IL13 in mouse lungs resulted in an increase in airway mucus secretion, development of subepithelial fibrosis, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR), and eosinophilic airway inflammation-that is, several key features of the human disease [51] . IL13 is produced by a variety of cells, including Th2 CD4+, Th1 CD4+, CD8+ T cells, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. IL13 mediates its effects by interacting with a complex receptor system comprising an IL-4R\u03b1/IL13R\u03b11 heterodimer and the IL13R\u03b12 receptor [49] .

Note: For candidate gene approaches, genes focused to replication in more than 10 studies [47, 48] . For GWAS, genes focused to those meeting conventional genome-wide significance (p < 5 \u00d7 10\u22128) and/or independent replication in the Caucasian population. To date, two of the most reproducible association signals are to the IL33 gene on chromosome 9p24 and the IL33 receptor (IL1RL1 or ST2) gene on chromosome 2, both of which highlight the significance of this ligand/receptor system in asthma. Interestingly, these loci are associated with severe asthma as well [54] . There is good evidence from biology that the IL33/ST2 axis may be of relevance in asthma; mice induced to develop allergic airway disease were treated with an antibody that blocks IL33 binding to its receptor. This treatment was shown to block many of the features of the disease, including reduced serum IgE and airway eosinophil and lymphocyte counts. Significantly, both induction and resolution of the disease were attenuated [55] .",

Overall, there was a clear improvement in lung function (primary outcome FEV 1 ) for both treatments; however, when stratified based on individual patient data, there was a very large degree of heterogeneity for both treatment groups, with some patients showing up to 50% improvement in FEV 1 and others showing a decline in lung function with a 30% decrease in FEV 1 (Figure 28.6 ).

This association was replicated in a pooled population of three asthma trial populations, as well as in three additional asthma populations [97] . SPATS2L was also identified as a modulator of \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptor-agonist function through a GWAS. Here, the SNP rs295137, located near the SPATS2L gene, was significantly associated with percentage change in baseline FEV 1 in 1644 Caucasian asthma patients; this was replicated in two alternate Caucasian populations (n \u223c 500 each).

            "text": "As outlined, leukotriene synthesis inhibitors (LTSIs) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are commonly used as an add-on therapy in asthma to provide greater control or steroid-sparing effects. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC 4 , LTD 4 , LTE 4 ) and dihydroxy leukotriene (LTB 4 ) contribute to the inflammatory process in asthma and are synthesized from arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway (Figure 28.7) . Cysteinyl leukotrienes have been implicated in bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, vascular permeability, inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine production. Arachidonic acid is converted to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotriene A 4 (LTA 4 ) by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO/ALOX5) and 5-lipoxygenaseactivating protein (FLAP/ALOX5AP), which acts as an adaptor protein for this reaction. LTA 4 is then converted to leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4 ) by LTA 4 hydrolase (LTA4H) or, alternatively, is conjugated with reduced glutathione to form LTC 4 via the actions of leukotriene C4 (LTC 4 ) synthase (LTC4S). LTC 4 is next transported to the extracellular space via the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) ( Figure  28 .7). Leukotriene modifiers include LTSIs, which act by targeting 5-LO (e.g., zileuton), resulting in a decrease in all leukotriene biosynthesis (LTC 4 , LTD 4 , LTE 4 , and LTB 4 ) or LTRAs, which act by specifically blocking cysteinyl leukotrienes from binding to their primary receptor, CYSLTR1, which is found on many cell types including inflammatory cells and airway smooth-muscle cells, (e.g., montelukast and zafirlukast).",

The rs2115819 SNP was also a predictor of response to the LTRA, montelukast, in a previous study of 252 asthma subjects using percentage change in FEV 1 as the primary outcome [104] . In both cases, the GG versus GA or AA genotype had the greatest improvement in lung function (FEV 1 ) post-drug [104] . The lack of association for the rs892690, and rs2029253 SNPs in the montelukast study may be due to the reduced power of this study compared to the zileuton study. The functional significance of these SNPs remains to be resolved, and it is important to note that they may not be the causative genetic change, and that polymorphisms inherited at the same time (i.e., in LD) may be of relevance. Two ALOX5 SNPs (rs4987105 (synonymous Thr120Thr) and rs4986832 (5\u2032 region)) were also associated with improvement in PEF on treatment with montelukast in a 12-week study in 174 asthma patients. This further confirmed the relevance of ALOX5 SNPs and this key enzyme in leukotriene production [105] . Additional support for the relevance of ALOX5 in asthma control is provided by a recent study of 270 children which found that the ALOX5 Sp1 promoter polymorphism determined urinary LTE 4 levels and was associated with reduced lung function and, potentially, an ACQ score in non-5 copy carriers [106] . In this study, there was an inverse relationship between urinary LTE 4 levels and FEV 1 .",

Interestingly, in combination with several ALOX5 SNPs, polymorphisms spanning CYSLTR1 have been identified as determinants of responses to montelukast, suggesting SNP-SNP interactions may be important [108] . However, direct evaluation of CYSLTR1 polymorphisms and responses to montelukast [104] or zileuton [102] have not identified a significant effect for them to date. Studies of CYSLTR2 are limited; however, SNPs rs91227 and rs912278 (3\u2032UTR) have been associated with an improvement in morning PEF following administration of montelukast for 12 weeks [105] .",

Multiple genes in the leukotriene synthesis pathway and/or receptors have polymorphisms that have been associated with asthma susceptibility, which implies that there may be a more leukotriene-driven asthma that is therefore more amenable to treatment with LTSIs and LTRAs. Of interest in this drug class, preliminary data suggest a significant contribution of SNPs in drug transporter genes, ultimately determining both the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics.

As with other genes discussed in this chapter, several polymorphisms have been described in the GR gene that have functional consequences, such as a Val641Asp polymorphism that has been shown to influence the binding affinity for dexamethasone. However, similar to most polymorphisms shown to have potential pharmacogenetic effects, several of these polymorphisms are rare and their functional significance is questionable [84] .

Additional data have given more confidence to the involvement of TBX21 because the His33Gln polymorphism was significantly associated with improved asthma control in the presence of corticosteroids, although the alternative allele to that described was associated with greater control in 53 Korean asthma patients during 5-12 weeks treatment [112] . Interestingly in the same study, Ye et al. identified a novel gene, the Neurokinin 2 receptor (NK2R), which was associated with improved asthma control in the presence of corticosteroids; the G allele (Gly) of the NK2R SNP rs77038916G/A, (Gly231Glu) was associated with the greatest improvement.
