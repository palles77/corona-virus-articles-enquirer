Cellular detection is a promising area in aptamer research. One of its principal advantages is the ability to target and specifically differentiate microbial strains without having previous knowledge of the membrane molecules or structural changes present in that particular microorganism. The present review focuses on aptamers, SELEX procedures, and aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms and viruses. Special emphasis is placed on nanoparticlebased platforms.",

Areas where detection of microbial pathogens is critical include clinical diagnosis, water and environmental analysis, food safety, and biodefense. Microbial culture-based tests and molecular assays (immunological or nucleic acid technologies) are the most common methodologies currently used (Lazcka et al., 2007) . These techniques are either time consuming or require sophisticated equipment and highly trained personnel, hence increasing the analysis cost. Rapid detection techniques should provide reliable, real time, on-field, user-friendly, and inexpensive detection with improved or equivalent sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of culture-based tests (Alocilja and Radke, 2003) . According to Lazcka et al. (2007) , biosensor technology is the fastest growing area in rapid pathogen detection. The commonly used biological recognition elements in biosensor platforms are antibodies and nucleic acid probes.",

The methodology consists of screening large random oligonucleotide libraries through iterative cycles of in vitro selection and enzymatic amplification (Ellington and Szostak, 1990; Tuerk and Gold, 1990; Robertson and Joyce, 1990) . Briefly, SELEX starts with incubation of the nucleic-acid sequence library with the target (protein, antibody, enzyme, etc.) , followed by separation and exponential amplification of the binding oligonucleotides. This process is repeated (typically 8-15 times) using the obtained enriched pool as starting library. Finally, cloning and sequencing of the final specific binding molecules allow identification of the best sequences ( Fig. 1) .",

Complex targets include nonwhole-cell (cell surface molecules, membrane fragments, bacterial lysates, and viral particles) and whole-cell targets (Chu et al., 2007; Shamah et al., 2008) . Proteins are the most common SELEX targets. Thrombin, an important protease in the coagulation cascade, has been the most studied target; its aptamer sequences have been used as biological recognition agents in the design and development of biosensors (Tombelli et al., 2007) . Aptamers are target-conformation specific, which means that if the target protein conformation changes, the binding event will be affected or may not occur. In order to get consistency within the SELEX cycles, it is necessary to use the target in the most stable conformation. Therefore, in some diagnostic and therapeutic applications, target proteins that are expressed on cell membranes cannot be introduced into SELEX as isolated and purified proteins. They need to be presented as cell fragment preparations (non-whole-cell targets) or intact whole cells (Shamah et al., 2008) . These targets are commonly called \"complex targets.\"",

One of its principal advantages is the ability to target specific pathological cell stages or cell types without having previous knowledge of the membrane molecules or structural changes related to that cell stage or type (Daniels et al., 2003; Hamula et al., 2006) . Cellular aptamers can be applied to isolate, concentrate, and identify particular cells from biological matrices (Guo et al., 2006) . One of the first models for complex-target SELEX used human red blood cell membranes as target (Morris et al., 1998) . In the report, ligands to specific target molecules in the complex mixture were isolated and identified using a deconvolution-SELEX strategy. Deconvolution, a secondary selection step, allows for the partitioning of the aptamer pool generated from the SELEX process that has evolved against multiple targets (Fitter and James, 2005) ( Fig. 1 ). This step involves: (a) evaluation of aptamer's ability to specifically bind, capture, and identify the target (Blank et al., 2001) ; or (b) incubation of the last selected aptamer pool with the target, in order to identify and isolate potential specific protein targets within the complex mixture, using magnetic capture beads and SDS/PAGE analysis (Morris et al., 1998; Fitter and James, 2005) .",

Trypanosoma brucei was used as the model organism for African trypanosomes and extracellular parasites. Three different classes of RNA aptamers were selected. The specific binding site was identified as a protein molecule located in the parasite flagellar pocket. The selected aptamers were not able to specifically identify T. brucei among other trypanosome strains tested (Homann and Goringer, 1999) . Further binding analysis and internalization capabilities of the African trypanosomes aptamers have been published (Homann and Ulrich, 2001) . Ulrich and collaborators (2002) reported the use of live Trypanosoma cruzi parasites as SELEX targets for the selection of RNA aptamers with inhibitory activity on T. cruzi cell invasion. T. cruzi is an intracellular parasite for which mediating parasite-host cell molecules that play an important role in the cell adhesion and invasion process have been identified (laminin, thrombospondin, heparin sulfate, and fibronectin) (Ulrich et al., 2002) . During the selection cycles, a selective displacement step was applied to the RNA molecules that bound to the T. cruzi surfaces. The four host cell molecules were incubated with the parasite-aptamer complexes and the displaced RNA molecules were used as starting library for the next selection cycle. The obtained RNA ligands specifically bound to the parasite receptors of the host cell matrix molecules. Also, all aptamer classes obtained were able to inhibit T. cruzi invasion in vitro (Ulrich et al., 2002) . The development of potential anti-parasitic drugs has been the main application of the trypanosome aptamer research. Post-SELEX optimization has been reported to improve in vivo functionality of the RNA aptamer against African trypanosomes (Adler et al., 2008) .",

However, some cross-reactivity was shown with Helicobacter pylori and Listeria sp. In these studies, neither the SELEX process nor the C. jejuni aptamer sequences were detailed in the report.",

The selected aptamer sequence, which constituted 30% of the final pool, specifically distinguishes M. tuberculosis cells (H37Rv strain) from M. bovis (the counterselection cells). The specific target molecules were partially identified as membrane proteins, using a proteinase analysis. M. tuberculosis cells were treated with trypsin and proteinase K before the incubation step with the aptamer sequence. Negative results were obtained for the binding reaction between the treated cells and the aptamer. This suggests that the binding sites were removed by the proteinase treatment and that they were most likely membrane proteins. This proteinase assay can be used for the initial identification of target molecules in whole-cell SELEX approaches.",

A major disadvantage is that most of the available aptamers are RNA structures, which are highly sensitive to nuclease degradation. Alternatives to overcome this problem include chemical modifications of the ribose at the 2 position (Pagratis et al., 1997; Kusser, 2000) and the use of mirrorimage analogs that are nuclease resistant (spiegelmers) (Eulberg and Klussmann, 2003) .",

In the study, zinc sulfide-capped cadmium selenide QDs were functionalized with a specific aptamer selected to detect B. thuringiensis. After QD-aptamer incubation with the target, the spores were washed and collected for fluorescence measurement. Several controls with non-functionalized QDs and without spores were tested to measure the non-specific attachment of the QDs to the spores and the fluorescence background noise. The reported sensitivity was 10 3 CFU/ml. For specificity purposes, spores from B. globigii (B. subtilis var. niger) were also tested. The system could differentiate B. thuringiensis from B. globigii at concentrations above 10 5 CFU/ml. The second strategy was developed to detect E. coli DH5\u2423, using aptamer-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (SWNT-FET) arrays . The binding event between E. coli cells and the aptamer-functionalized FET produced a drop in conductance (>50%) in culture samples with concentrations between 10 5 and 10 7 CFU/ml. Specificity assays were conducted with S. Typhimurium.",

The principal challenge is the presence of multiple target proteins in the cell wall, which produces difficulty in the post-SELEX evaluation and binding standardization.

Recently, several aptasensor platforms have been developed that include the use of nanoparticles, particularly gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and QDs (Fischer et al., 2007; Li et al., 2008) . The optical properties of AuNPs are commonly used in colorimetric detection. The surface resonance frequency of AuNPs can be modified, resulting in different detectable colors . The chromatic changes result from the aptamer-functionalized AuNP aggregation after target recognition. Colorimetric assays do not require sophisticated detection apparatus (Balamurugan et al., 2008) , and the detection can be performed in solution, avoiding the disadvantages of platform immobilization. Liu and Lu (2006) developed two solution-based colorimetric detection systems, using AuNPs functionalized with aptamers to detect adenosine and cocaine. AuNP aggregates linked by oligonucleotide sequences containing the specific aptamer were constructed. In the presence of adenosine or cocaine, the aptamer changed its structure to bind to the target molecule. This resulted in disassembly of the aggregates which produced a change in the color system from purple to red (Fig. 2) . The color change was instantaneous in the presence of 2 mM adenosine and 1 mM cocaine (Liu and Lu, 2006) . In a similar system, successful colorimetric detection was described for platelet-derived growth factor (Huang et al., 2005) .",

(2007) used two aptamer-functionalized QDs, with different fluorescence emission wavelength for simultaneous detection of adenosine and cocaine, containing AuNPs as quenchers. QDs were assembled with AuNPs by the specific aptamer, quenching the QD fluorescence emission. Addition of the targets (adenosine and cocaine) disassembled the aggregates, resulting in increased fluorescence. The targets were simultaneously detected by fluorescence and colorimetric measurements in solution (Liu et al., 2007) . QD-aptamer systems have also been used to detect thrombin (Levy et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2006) . Hansen et al. (2006) developed an electrochemical aptasensor using QDs to detect thrombin and lysozyme simultaneously. A gold electrode was functionalized with thiolated aptamers for each protein. QD-tagged proteins (CdS for thrombin and PbS for lysozyme) were bound to the corresponding aptamer into the gold substrate. In the presence of the target proteins, the QD-protein complexes were displaced and the remaining nanocrystals were electrochemically detected. The position and size of the corresponding metal peaks (Cd and Pb) in the voltammograms corresponded to the type and amount of the respective protein target (thrombin and lysozyme) (Hansen et al., 2006) .",

One of the main disadvantages of using a whole-cell target approach in SELEX is that the specific target molecule is initially unknown, which can cause specificity problems and can also produce difficulty in the post-SELEX optimization of the binding assay between the obtained aptamer sequence and the target. Some alternatives to overcome these issues are the use of counter-selection steps with closely related species, and the use of deconvolution-SELEX steps to partition the initial aptamer pools against the multiple targets present in cell surfaces.",

            "text": "To date, most of the isolated aptamers against microorganisms have been selected for clinical applications. Aptamer application to detect environmental and foodborne pathogens is a promising area of research. Matrix complexity is one of the greatest challenges in molecular diagnostic application to foodborne pathogen detection. Several components regularly present in food samples can produce interference or cross-reaction in both immunology-based and nucleic acid-based detection systems. Therefore, additional isolation, concentration and/or purification of the microbial target is required before molecular detection, which increases the assay time and cost. However, the ability to select aptamers in real complex matrices represents a way to overcome these issues. Several aptasensor platforms for detecting pathogenic proteins have been developed, especially for viral proteins detection. Aptasensors for microbial whole-cell identification are a promising and challenging application, with potential advantages over existing immunological whole-cell biosensors.",
