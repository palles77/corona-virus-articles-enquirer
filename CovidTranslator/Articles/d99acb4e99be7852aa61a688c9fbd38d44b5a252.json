The glycoprotein gene was inserted at the 1 st or the 3 rd position of the measles virus genome and the recombinant viruses were generated. Insertion of the foreign gene at the 3 rd position had a minimal impact on viral replication in vitro. RSV F or EBV gp350 protein was secreted from infected cells. In cotton rats, EZ-RSV F and EZ-EBV gp350 induced MV-and insert-specific antibody responses. In addition, both vaccines also induced insert specific interferon gamma (IFN-) secreting T cell response. EZ-RSV F protected cotton rats from pulmonary replication of RSV A2 challenge infection. In rhesus macaques, although both EZ-RSV F and EZ-EBV gp350 induced MV specific neutralizing antibody responses, only RSV F specific antibody response was detected. Thus, the immunogenicity of the foreign antigens delivered by measles vaccine virus is dependent on the nature of the insert and the animal models used for vaccine evaluation.",

Live attenuated vaccine viruses simulate natural infection and are highly immunogenic and effective in inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses. Because of their demonstrated safety and effectiveness against infectious diseases, different live attenuated vaccine viruses have been explored as vectors to express heterologous antigens [1] . Measles vaccine (MV) strain has a long history of demonstrated safety in humans. It induces long lasting immunity including antibody and T cell responses [2] [3] [4] . Aerosol administration of measles vaccine is also being developed and has been shown to induce similar or better immunogenicity compared to conventional subcutaneous or intramuscular vaccination [5, 6] . This aerosol administration route may offer advantages in helping to protect individuals from mucosal pathogens.",

            "text": "The development of reverse genetics for negative stranded RNA viruses including measles virus has made it possible to explore the utility of the negative stranded RNA viruses to deliver foreign antigens. Measles vaccine virus has been explored by several laboratories to express foreign antigens such as the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS coronavirus, HIV gp160, HPV L1 and hepatitis B surface antigens [7] [8] [9] [10] . The vectored MV induces robust antibody and T cell responses against both insert antigens *Address correspondence to this author at the MedImmune, 319 North Bernardo Ave, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; Tel: 650 603 2367; Fax: 650 603 3367; E-mail: jinh@medimmune.com \u00a7 Both authors contributed to the work equally. and MV [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , making it an attractive option for vaccination against measles as well as other infectious agents. Although some studies showed that MV could boost measles virus immune response in school aged children who had previously received measles vaccine [19, 20] , the preexisting immunity to measles virus may reduce the immunogenicity of the vectored measles vaccine [21, 22] . Thus, the utility of MV vector in measles seropositive population remains to be determined. Several studies performed in the early 1980s in developing countries revealed that high seroconversion rates were achieved with EZ measles vaccine despite the presence of high titer of maternal measles virus antibody [23] . Therefore, the EZ strain might be immunogenic in populations with histories of measles vaccination or preexisting MV immunity.",

No vaccine is available to prevent morbidity and mortality from RSV infection. The surface fusion (F) protein of RSV is a major antigenic protein that induces neutralizing antibodies, CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and protection against subsequent RSV challenge in mice or cotton rats [25] . High levels of F neutralizing antibodies are sufficient to protect the lower respiratory tract infection [26] and have been used for prophylactic purpose in infants.",

To generate rEZ expressing RSV F or EBV gp350, the F ectodomain of RSV and EBV gp350 were cloned into the MV antigenomic cDNA (Fig. 1A) . The F was cloned at the two positions of the viral genome: one proximal to the N gene (1 st position) and the other between the P and M genes (3 rd position). EBV gp350 ectodomain and its N-terminal half of the gp350 (amino acid 1-470, gp350tr) that encoded the receptor binding site to CD21 [39] were also cloned into the EZ genome at the 1 st and 3 rd positions. Recombinant EZ with RSV F, EBV gp350 and EBV gp350tr inserted at the 1 st or 3 rd position were generated. However, viruses with gp350 and gp350tr inserted at the 1 st position replicated poorly in vitro and were not evaluated further. The rescued recombinant viruses expressing RSV F or EBV gp350 or gp350tr were designed as sF1 (F at the 1 st position), sF3 (F at the 3 rd position), gp350 and gp350tr (both at the 3 rd position), respectively.",

In addition to MV N protein that was detected in infected cell lysate (Fig. 1B) , RSV F and EBV gp350 were detected in the culture supernatant of the infected cells (Fig.  1B) , indicating the production of secreted form of RSV F and EBVgp350 proteins from virus infected cells. The observation of lower MV N expression in Vero cells infected with sF1 compared to other viruses may be attributed to the insertion of RSV F proximal to the MV N gene, which moved the MV N gene to the 2 nd position of the genome and reduced its mRNA transcript level. The relative expression of RSV F to MV N, however, was shown to be higher for sF1 compared to sF3. This is consistent with the observation that genes proximal to 3' end of the genome are transcribed more abundantly than those downstream and more RSV F was produced from sF1 than sF3 per virion. Viral replication efficiency of these recombinant viruses was assessed by growth kinetics in Vero cells. Both recombinant EZ (rEZ) and EZ vaccine viruses grew to a peak titer of 7.9 log 10 PFU/mL on day 5 (Fig. 3A) . rEZ with either RSVF (Fig. 2A) or EBVgp350 (Fig. 2B) inserts had comparable growth kinetics but slightly lower (between 0.1-0.7 log 10 lower) than rEZ. The peak titers between the viruses were not statistically different. sF3 had a faster growth kinetics and reached peak titer on day 3 instead of day 5. Therefore, insertion of RSV F or EBV gp350 into the genome of EZ did not significantly reduce viral growth in vitro.",

After a second dose, three out of 4 animals in MV+ group had more than 4-fold increase in RSV F-specific IgG Ab titer but none of the animals in MV-group had 4-fold increase in Ab response (Fig. 5A) . After two doses of vaccination, RSV neutralizing Ab titers in all groups were very low in both MV+ and MV-groups. Seven out of 8 animals had a detectable level of RSV neutralizing Ab. The RSV Nt Ab titers were not statistically different between the two groups (5.0 log 2 for MV+ versus 4.5 log 2 for MV-groups) ( Table 2) . Ab responses to EBV gp350 in the gp350 vaccinated monkeys were not detected at all time points. Similar to antibody responses, IFN-secreting cells in PBMC to measles viral antigens were significantly higher (~10fold) than the responses to either RSV F or EBV gp350 (Fig.  5B) while PBMC, when stimulated with measles viral antigens, RSV F or EBV gp350, did not secrete any IL-4. Thus, compared to the cotton rat studies, rEZ vectored viruses were poorly immunogenic in the primate model.",

            "text": "Reverse genetics has been developed for generating recombinant measles virus vectored vaccines encoding foreign antigens based on the Edmonston-Schwarz and AIK-C vaccine strain [15, 48] . The reverse genetic system described in this study was based on the EZ vaccine strain, which is used predominantly outside the US. The EZ strain might be immunogenic in population that has prior measles vaccine immunization [23] . The ectodomains of the RSV F and EBV gp350 glycoproteins instead of full length proteins were engineered to be expressed by EZ to avoid the incorporation of the foreign surface glycoproteins onto the measles virus envelope. The expression of heterologous membrane proteins on measles virus surface may alter the binding of measles to its natural receptors and thus change the tissue tropism of measles virus. We showed that both RSV F and EBV gp350 was expressed efficiently in vitro. However, rEZ vectored vaccines induced insert specific responses in cotton rats but poor responses in rhesus macaques although both cotton rats and rhesus macaques have previously been shown to be permissive to measles virus infection to various degrees [47, [49] [50] [51] . Titers of prevaccinated animals were under the limit of detection in all the assays. One of the important determinants for inducing a robust immune response in vivo is the amount of the expressed antigen level and antigen presentation. We have evaluated the effect of the gene insertion location and antigen expression level because transcription of nonsegmented negative strand RNA viruses is obligatorily sequential [52] . The genes located at proximal to the 3' promoter are produced more abundantly than the ones distal to the promoter [53] . Indeed, when RSV F was introduced 3' proximally to the N gene, it produced 10 times more secreted RSV F protein than when inserted between the P and M junction (data not shown). In comparison, insertion of the gp350 of EBV at the 1st position of EZ significantly affected virus replication. Insertion of the EBV gp350 gene between the P and M genes had less effect on virus growth, similar to that shown for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (14) . The gene insertion position affected immunogenicity of EZ vectored vaccines in cotton rats. rEZ encoding RSV F ectodomain induced antibody response against measles and RSV F. rEZ-sF3 induced MV specific antibody response comparable to rEZ and RSV specific Ab response comparable to those induced by intranasal RSV infection in cotton rats; it also induced cell mediated response as measured by IFN-ELISpot assay. Surprisingly, sF1 was inferior to sF3 in its ability to induce both RSV neutralizing antibody and RSV F-specific IFN-secreting T cell responses, suggesting that sF1 may be more attenuated than sF3 in vivo. Immune response is dependent on viral infectivity and the nature of the inserts. rEZ vectored EBV gp350 and gp350tr induced lower gp350 specific IgG Ab response and undetectable neutralizing antibody response in cotton rats.",

Rhesus macaque is fully permissive to measles virus infection and the infected monkeys develop symptoms similar to those experienced by humans, such as skin rash, fever and conjunctivitis [47] . This monkey model was used in the neurovirulence testing of MV vaccine [57] . In addition, since rhesus macaques could be infected with human measles virus, the breeding colony is commonly vaccinated with MV. This allowed us to examine the effect of prior vaccination on vectored measles and mimic our target populations that either have maternal antibodies or have measles vaccination history. rEZ and rEZ expressing gp350 and sF3 induced a good level of antibody response to PBMCs measles virus irrespective of their sero-status to MV. The antibody response was slightly lower in magnitude than what were observed in the cotton rats as the dose per kg used in the rhesus was ~ 90 times lower than in cotton rats. The antibody response to the F and gp350 inserts was much lower in rhesus macaques. A previous report showed that two doses of MV-HIV gp140 at 5x10 6 TCID 50 (25 times higher dose than our study) induced a robust Ab response towards HIV gp140 in monkeys [10] . However, three doses of 10 4 TCID 50 (1/15 our dose) of MV vectored HBV surface antigen induced a very low response in monkeys [14] . Thus, the low humoral responses to the vectored inserts in rhesus macaques may be due to a lower dose used in this study.",

This may be attributed to the low copies of measles virus circulating in the blood or the time point used to measure measles kinetics in vivo was not optimal. In conjunction, we have examined replication of EZ vectors in PBMC of rhesus macaques ex vivo to determine if insertion of the foreign gene affected replication of these viruses in PBMC. PHAactivated PBMC cells were infected with rMV at MOI of 1.0 and growth kinetics were determined for 7 days.

The amount of gp350 delivered by MV is likely not sufficient to induce gp350 specific immune response. The F protein of RSV delivered by MV is more immunogenic than EBV gp350, however, additional evaluation of immunogenicity of MV-RSV F must be conduced before proceeding to testing this vaccine in humans.",

(A) RSV F ectodomain and EBV gp350 ectodomains were inserted in the 1 st and 3 rd transcription units of the measles Zagreb strain genome. Insertion was performed in the non-coding region 3' proximally of the MV N gene or between P and M genes of pEZ under the control of additional measles transcriptional units containing gene stop (GE)-gene start (GS) sequences. *RSV F gene (aa. 1-524) was inserted into EcoRV site using blunt ligation. # EBV gp350 full length (aa. 1-960), EBV gp350 truncated (aa. 1-470) or RSV F gene was inserted between EcoRV and AfeI site. (B) Vero cells were infected at an MOI of 3.0 with measles viruses encoding soluble RSV F (sF1 or sF3) or soluble EBV gp350 (gp350 or gp350 tr). After 18 h, western blots were used to detect presence of measles virus nucleoprotein in infected Vero cell lysates or RSV F protein, EBV gp350 protein in the supernatant. Black arrowheads indicate the predicted molecular masses of the proteins. Relative intensity of the MV N protein bands was expressed as the intensity of the band relative to the rEZ control.",
