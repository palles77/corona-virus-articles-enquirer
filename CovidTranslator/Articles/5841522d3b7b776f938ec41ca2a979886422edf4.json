Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called \"quasispecies.\" Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (1) RNA virus genomes and (2) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs composed of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus. By using DRS, we were able to map the longest (\u223c26-kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, by using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by showing the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation. Even though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology fully, our work illustrates that DRS may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.",

The genome sizes of coronaviruses (\u223c30 kb) exceed those of most other RNA viruses. Coronaviruses use a special mechanism called discontinuous extension of minus strands Sawicki 1995, 1998) to produce a nested set of 5 \u2032 -and 3 \u2032 -coterminal subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that carry a common 5 \u2032 leader sequence that is identical to the 5 \u2032 -end of the viral genome (Zuniga et al. 2004; Sawicki et al. 2007 ). These sg mRNAs contain a different number of open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the viral structural proteins and several accessory proteins. With very few exceptions, only the 5 \u2032 -located ORF (which is absent from the next smaller sg mRNA) is translated into protein (Fig. 1) .",

In its 5 \u2032 -terminal region, the genome RNA contains two large ORFs, 1a and 1b, that encode the viral replicase polyproteins 1a and 1ab. mRNAs 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are used to produce the S protein, accessory protein 4, E protein, M protein, and N protein, respectively. The 5 \u2032 -region of mRNA 3 contains a truncated fragment of ORF S, which is considered defective. Although this sg RNA has been consistently identified in HCoV-229E-infected cells, its mRNA function has been disputed, and there is currently no evidence that this RNA is translated into protein (Schreiber et al. 1989; Raabe et al. 1990; Thiel et al. 2003) .",

            "text": "Like many other +RNA viruses, coronaviruses show high rates of recombination (Lai 1992; Liao and Lai 1992; Furuya et al. 1993) . In fact, the mechanism to produce 5 \u2032 leader-containing sg mRNAs represents a prime example for copy-choice RNA recombination that, in this particular case, is guided by complex RNA-RNA interactions involving the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) core sequences and likely requires additional interactions of viral proteins with specific RNA signals. In other virus systems, RNA recombination has been shown to generate \"transcriptional units\" that control the expression of individual components of the genome (Holmes 2009 ). The mechanisms involved in viral RNA recombination are diverse and may even extend to nonreplicating systems (Gallei et al. 2004 ). In the vast majority of cases, recombination results in defective RNA (dRNA) copies that lack essential cis-active elements and thus cannot be replicated. In other cases, functional recombinant RNA with new properties, such as the ability to replicate in a new host, may emerge (Chang et al. 1994 (Chang et al. , 1996 Brown et al. 2007; Gustin et al. 2009) . In yet other cases, defective interfering RNAs (DI-RNAs) may be produced. These defective (sg-length) RNAs contain all the cis-acting elements required for efficient replication by a helper virus polymerase and, therefore, represent parasitic RNAs that compete for components of the viral replication/transcription complex with nondefective viral RNAs (Pathak and Nagy 2009) .",

Further, by using DRS, we avoid several drawbacks of previous sequencing methods, in particular cDNA synthesis and amplification of the input material. Thus, for example, cDNA synthesis can create artificial RNA-RNA chimerae (Karst et al. 2018 ) that are difficult to discriminate from naturally occurring chimerae (such as spliced RNAs). Also, amplification before sequencing would remove all RNA modifications from the input material, whereas the nanopore sequencing technology preserves these modifications (Smith et al. 2017; Garalde et al. 2018) .",

By using DRS, we aim to capture complete viral mRNAs, including the full coronavirus genome, in single contiguous reads. Sequence analysis of thousands of full-length sg RNAs will allow us to determine the architectures (including leader-body junction sites) of the major viral mRNAs. In addition, this approach provides insight into the diversity of additional HCoV-229E sg RNAs, probably including DI-RNAs. Further, we aim to assess whether RNA modifications can be called directly from the raw nanopore signal of viral molecules without prior in vitro treatment, as has been shown for DNA (Stoiber et al. 2016; McIntyre et al. 2019) .",

As shown in Table 1 , we achieved a throughput of 0.237 and 0.282 Gb with 225,000 and 181,000 reads for the WT and SL2 sample, respectively. See Supplemental Figure  S1A for an overview of the read length distribution. For the WT and SL2 samples, 33.3% and 35.9% of the reads mapped to the reference HCoV-229E sequences, respectively; 15.8% and 10.2%, respectively, mapped to the yeast enolase 2 mRNA sequence, a calibration strand added during the library preparation, whereas 47.4% and 52.7% could be attributed to human host cell RNA. Minimap2 (Li 2018) did not align the remaining 3.50% and 1.11% of reads. Using BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990 ) against the nucleotide database, 18.1% and 20.7% of these reads can be attributed again to HCoV, human or yeast. As reads that were not aligned by minimap2 were mostly very short (median \u2264200 nt), of poor basecalling quality and represented only 0.62% and 0.15% of total nucleotides, respectively, we decided to only use the higher quality reads that minimap2 could align (for detailed statistics, see Supplemental (Raabe et al. 1990; Schreiber et al. 1989 ). Translation of the 5 \u2032 -terminal ORF(s) of the respective mRNA gives rise to the various viral structural and nonstructural proteins (indicated by different colors). mRNA 3 is considered defective and unlikely to be translated into protein. Each mRNA has a 3 \u2032 poly(A) tail and carries a 5 \u2032 -leader sequence that is identical to the 5 \u2032 -end of the genome. In a process called discontinuous extension of negative strands, negative-strand RNA synthesis is attenuated at specific genomic positions. After transfer of the nascent strand to an upstream position on the template, RNA synthesis is continued by copying the 5 \u2032 -leader sequence. As a result, the 3 \u2032 -ends of coronavirus minus-strand mRNAs are equipped with the complement of the 5 \u2032leader. The latter process is guided by base-pairing interactions between the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) located immediately downstream from the leader sequence (TRS-L) at the 5 \u2032 -end of the genome and the sequence complement of a TRS located upstream of one of the ORFs present in the 3 \u2032 -proximal genome region (TRS-B).",

This included gaps but omitted discontinuous sites >6 nt because they indicated recombination. Half of all errors were deletions. In addition, we found that more than half of all single-nucleotide deletions occur in homopolymers, and most of these stretches that coincide with a deletion are \u22653 nt long (see Supplemental Fig. S4 ).

The high coverage of the 3 \u2032 -end reflects the higher abundance of mRNAs produced from the 3 \u2032 -terminal genome regions and is a result of the discontinuous transcription mechanism used by coronaviruses and several other nidoviruses (Pasternak et al. 2006; Sawicki et al. 2007; Sola et al. 2015) . The 3 \u2032 -coverage is further increased by the directional sequencing that starts from the mRNA 3 \u2032 -terminal poly(A) tail. Also, the observed coverage bias for the very 5 \u2032 -end results from the coronavirus-specific transcription mechanism because all viral mRNAs are equipped with the 65-nt 5 \u2032 -leader sequence derived from the 5 \u2032 -end of the genome. The remainder of the high 5 \u2032coverage bias likely reflects the presence of high numbers of DI-RNAs in which 5 \u2032 -and 3 \u2032 -proximal genomic sequences were fused, probably resulting from illegitimate recombination events as shown previously for other coronaviruses (Liao and Lai 1992; Furuya et al. 1993; Luytjes et al. 1996) . For the WT and SL2 samples, 38.37% and 16.32% were split-mapped, respectively. Of these, only 278 and 181 had multiple splits. The considerably larger fraction of split reads in the WT sample is explained by the high abundance of potential DI-RNA molecules (see Figure 2C ).",

The median read length might sound short; however, most of the viral RNAs (including many DI-RNAs) identified in HCoV-229E-infected cells were <2000 nt in length. Furthermore, this number nearly doubles the longest read length that can be obtained with short-read sequencing methods. We observed an abundance of very short reads, representing the 3 \u2032 (poly[A]) end of the genome. This could be an artifact of RNA degradation, although we cannot estimate the exact fraction of affected transcripts. Because sequencing starts at the poly(A) tail, fragmented RNA will not be sequenced beyond any 3 \u2032 break point. It is thus best to minimize handling time during RNA extraction and library preparation. Innovations in these fields will directly translate into larger median read lengths.",

We attempted a standard long-read assembly using Canu (Koren et al. 2017) , which yielded unusable results (WT: 389 contigs, longest 13 kb, all other <4 kb; SL2: 517 contigs, all <6 kb). We think that current nanopore-only assembly tools are not equipped to handle special read data sets such as those originating from a small RNA virus genome. In addition, we assembled WT and SL2 consensus sequences using Nanopore and Illumina data with HG-CoLoR (Morisse et al. 2018) in an approach that uses long nanopore reads to traverse an assembly graph constructed from short Illumina reads. We thereby recovered 99.57% of the reference genome in a single contiguous sequence at 99.90% sequence identity to reference using this approach with the single longest read from the SL2 sample. This hybrid approach illustrates how short-and long-read technologies can be combined to Both samples contain mainly HCoV-229E and host (Homo sapiens) transcripts, but also Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase 2 (ENO2) mRNA reads (which was used as a calibration standard added during library preparation). Half of the sequencing errors were deletion errors, probably resulting to a large extent from basecalling at homopolymer stretches. The S. cerevisiae enolase 2 mRNA reads display an overall reduced error rate (bold) because the Albacore basecaller was trained on this calibration strand. Note that all error rates report differences to the reference genome and thus include actual genetic variation. ",

In this study, we defined a recombination site as any site that flanks more than 100 consecutive gaps, as determined in a discontinuous mapping (\"spliced\" mapping). Although there is currently no consensus on how to define such sites, we believe this to be a conservative definition, as this type of pattern is unlikely to result from, for example, miscalled homopolymer runs that, in our experience, typically affect less than 10 consecutive bases.

The mapping algorithm was often unable to align these erroneous 5 \u2032ends, leading to soft-clipped bases.

            "text": "As indicated above, only 12% of the sg RNAs were found to conform to our current understanding of discontinuous mRNA transcription in coronaviruses, resulting in mRNAs that (all) carry an identical 5 \u2032 -leader sequence that is fused to the 3 \u2032 -coding (\"body\") sequence of the respective mRNA. We, however, believe that 12% represents an underestimate because a large number of sg RNAs were probably omitted from the analysis: First, RNA molecules degrade rapidly under laboratory conditions, even when handled carefully. The resulting fragments will only be sequenced if they contain a poly(A) tail. Second, the high sequencing error may introduce mismappings, especially for low-quality reads. , and nanopore reads of SL2 sample (C; inner track) reveal multiple recombination sites across the whole genome. An aggregation of recombination sites can be observed in the region that encodes the viral N protein. Furthermore, clear recombination sites can be seen at intergenic boundaries and at the 5 \u2032 and 3 \u2032 UTRs, with the former corresponding to the boundary between the leader sequence and the rest of the genome. Another prominent cluster can be observed in ORF1a in the WT nanopore sample but not in SL2. This cluster is supported by the WT Illumina data, excluding sequencing bias as a potential source of error. We hypothesize that because samples WT and SL2 were obtained from nonplaque-purified serially passaged virus populations derived from in vitro transcribed genome RNAs transfected into Huh7 cells, differences in the proportion of full-length transcripts versus abortive transcripts could translate into different patterns of recombination. Generally, nanopore-based sequencing allows more detailed analysis of recombination events owing to the long read length. Even complex isoforms such as two exemplary reads, each with four discontinuous segments, can be observed (blue and pink). These reads would not be assigned to the canonical model under our assumptions because of the high number of mismatches. However, we think the associated bias is low, because minimap2 is very robust against high error rates and because the reads are very long, thus ensuring that the mapper has sufficient aggregate information on a given read to position it very reliably on a reference. Third, the library preparation protocol for DRS includes the ligation of adapters via a T4 ligase. Any ligase could potentially introduce artificial chimera, although we did not investigate this systematically. Again, we think that this does not affect our results substantially: (1) This bias is random, and it seems unlikely that we would observe the very same RNA \"isoform\" many times if it was created by random ligation; (2) many \"isoforms\" that we observed only once (e.g., those colored pink and blue in Fig. 3 ) were structured plausibly: They contained a leader sequence and had recombined at expected (self-similar) sites corresponding to putative or validated TRSs, with downstream sequences being arranged in a linear 5 \u2032 -3 \u2032 -order. Fourth, finally, it is important to note that the RNA used for DRS was isolated from cells infected with a serially passaged pool of recombinant viruses rescued after transfection of in vitro transcribed genome-length (27.3-kb) RNAs. Transfection of preparations of in vitro transcribed RNA of this large size likely included a significant proportion of abortive transcripts that lacked varying parts of the 3 \u2032 genome regions, rendering them dysfunctional. It is reasonable to suggest that the presence of replication-incompetent RNAs lacking essential 3 \u2032 -terminal genome regions may have triggered recombination events resulting in the emergence of DI-RNAs that contained all the 5 \u2032 -and 3 \u2032 -terminal cis-active elements required for RNA replication but lacked nonessential internal genome regions. Upon serial passaging of the cell culture supernatants for 21 times, DI-RNAs may have been enriched, especially in the HCoV-229E (WT) sam-ple (Fig. 3) . Comparative DRS analyses of RNA obtained from cells infected with (1) plaque-purified HCoV-229E and (2) newly rescued recombinant HCoV-229E (without prior plaque purification), respectively, would help to address the possible role of prematurely terminated in vitro transcripts produced from fulllength cDNA in triggering the large number of DI-RNAs observed in our study.",

We found consistent 5mC methylation patterns across viral RNAs when tested at a FPR <5%. We were not able to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the methylation calling owing to the absence of a positive control group, which was beyond the scope of this study. Figure 4 . Distribution of aligned read lengths up to 8000 nt for both samples based on alignments with minimap2. We observed clusters that correspond well with the transcript lengths expected for canonical mRNAs (vertical dotted lines). Alignment of the reads to these canonical mRNA sequences confirmed these observed abundances (Supplemental Fig. S5 ). The distribution shows double peaks at the cluster positions because reads corresponding to mRNAs often miss the leader sequence, possibly owing to basecalling or mapping errors. We also observed additional clusters that likely correspond to highly abundant DI-RNAs. (A) A cluster in the WT sample that represents chimeric \u223c820-nt sg RNAs composed of both 5 \u2032 -and 3 \u2032 -terminal genome regions (\u223c540 and \u223c280 nt, respectively). We propose the template switch for this transcript occurs around position 27,000 and RNA synthesis resumes at around position 540 (see corresponding peaks in Fig. 3, track B) . (B) A cluster from the SL2 sample that contains transcripts with an approximate length of 5150 nt, which represents mRNA 3 (see Fig. 1 ).

Ideally, this validation should start from in vitro synthetic transcripts in which modified bases have been inserted in known positions. Furthermore, RNA modification detection from single-molecule sequencing is a current bioinformatic frontier, and algorithms and tools are under active development. We showed that consistent 5mC methylation patterns were seen across different sg RNAs. However, the overall pattern of the methylation calls between sg RNAs and the negative control was very similar. At a FPR of 5%, the RNA modifications we identified are supported by their consistent occurrence. However, we cannot rule out that instead, the observed pattern might be caused by an alignment artifact. In the used methylation calling algorithm, the raw signal is aligned to the nucleotide sequence after basecalling. If there is a systematic bias in this alignment and certain sequence motifs cause a consistent mapping mismatch, this mismatch could lead to false-positive methylated sites. This is because in these positions the signal would deviate from the expected one owing to the misalignment and not owing to methylation. In future experiments, this can be decided using a positive control in the form of an RNA transcript with known 5mC methylated sites. However, even if we are in its early stages, the reading of RNA modifications from the read signal has great potential to elucidate viral biology.",

More problematic was the resolution of quasispecies in our experimental setup. Although DRS allowed us to confirm the presence of each of the two heterologous SL2 structures present in the SL2 sample, this was only possible for sg-length (DI-) RNAs. It appears that the high error rate of >10% was a critical limitation when analyzing the SL2 region located at the extreme 5 \u2032 -terminal end of the 27.3-kb genome RNA. This high error rate made variant calling difficult, particularly under low-coverage conditions. The current generation of long-read assemblers is not well suited to reconstruct many viral genome architectures, such as nested ones. The development of specialized assemblers would be of great help in virology projects.",
