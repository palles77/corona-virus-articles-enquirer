Methods: We constructed and characterized two recombinant baculoviruses carrying the expression cassette for the H5N1 influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) gene driven by either an insect cell promoter (vAc-HA) or a dual-promoter active both in insect and mammalian cells (vAc-HA-DUAL). Virus without the HA gene (vAc-EGFP) was used as a control. These viruses were used to immunize mice subcutaneously and intraperitoneally. The production of total and specific antibodies was determined by ELISA and competitive ELISA. Cytokine production by the spleen cells of immunized mice was studied using the ELISPOT assay. Results: Both the vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL vectors expressed HA proteins in insect Sf9 cells, and HA antigen was present in progeny virions. The vAc-HA-DUAL vector also mediated HA expression in virus-transduced mammalian cell lines (BHK and A547). Both vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL exhibited higher transduction efficiencies than vAc-EGFP in mammalian cells, as shown by the expression of the reporter gene egfp. Additionally, both vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL induced high levels of HA-specific antibody production in immunized mice; vAc-HA-DUAL was more efficient in inducing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 upon stimulation with specific antigen, whereas vAc-HA was more efficient in inducing IL-4 and IL-6. Conclusion: Baculovirus vectors elicited efficient, specific immune responses in immunized mice. The vector displaying the HA antigen on the virion surface (vAc-HA) elicited a Th2-biased immune response, whereas the vector displaying HA and mediating HA expression in the cell (vAc-HA-DUAL) elicited a Th1-biased immune response.",

All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Care and Use of Fudan University. One week following the second immunization, serum samples were collected from the retro-orbital plexus for serological testing and antibody assay; the mice were sacrificed, and splenocytes were harvested for ELISPOT assay.",

These recombinant viruses contained the expression cassette for the H5N1 influenza virus HA gene allowing protein production in either insect cells (vAc-HA) or in both insect and mammalian cells (vAc-HA-DUAL). Both viruses mediated HA protein production in infected insect Sf9 cells at similar levels. HA is believed to have been transported to the surface of infected insect cells based on the observation that chicken red blood cells attached to the surface of the Sf9 cells infected by HA-expressing viruses, but not to mock-infected cells [15] or cells infected by control virus (data not shown). This is consistent with results showing that HA proteins were present in the viral envelopes of vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL and confirms previous results that HA-transportation signals were properly recognized by insect cells [16] . The expression and surface display of HA proteins appeared to slow down the rate of viral replication in insect cells as indicated by the kinetics of budding virus production. This reduction was most likely due to the presence of HA on the virion envelope and the surface of infected cells that diluted GP64, the baculovirus major envelope protein, and thus affected viral entry and/or assembly and budding [17, 18] . However, the effect seems to be limited, as the virus titer caught up at the late stage of virus infection.",

The predominant cytokines that resulted were found to be different in mice immunized with the different baculoviruses. In mice immunized with vAc-HA, more splenocytes secreted IL-4 and IL-6 than IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, and the level of IL-4 in the culture medium was higher than the level of IFN-\u03b3. These results suggest that vAc-HA induced a Th2-biased immune response in mice, which is consistent with the behavior of vAc-HA as a particle protein vaccine.

Unlike vAc-HA, more splenocytes from immunized mice produced IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 than the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10, and the level of IFN-\u03b3 was higher than that of IL-4 in the culture medium, suggesting a Th1-biased immune response.

In addition to its high biosafety, easy handling, efficient protein production in insect cells and other advantages, baculovirus vaccine vectors have low preexisting immunity in humans and animals and the ability to elicit innate immunity. AcMNPV was found to have strong adjuvant properties. It could also activate dendritic cell (DC)mediated innate immunity through MyD88/TLR9-dependent and MyD88/TLR9-independent pathways, which might help to improve the efficacy of baculovirus vector vaccines [24] . In fact, AcMNPV was shown to induce antiviral activity in mammalian cells and confer protection against lethal encephalomyocarditis virus and influenza virus infections in mice [25, 26] .",

            "text": "Several recent studies have shown that baculovirus transduction vectors tend to elicit a Th1-biased immune reaction against the target antigen when the antigen was only expressed in the transduced cells and was not presented on the virions. Evidence has shown that a baculovirus vector with a mammalian expression cassette producing proteins from a SARS-like coronavirus could elicit a Th1-dominant immune response in mice [6, [13] [14] [15] [16] . A similar approach has been used to develop vaccines against pseudorabies virus. High proportions of Ig2a IgG and high levels of IFN-\u03b3 were found, indicating a Th1-type immune response. Studies using baculovirus capable of displaying circumsporozoite proteins from plasmodium on the virion surface and expressing the same protein in transduced mammalian cells demonstrated that the baculovirus induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response, resulting in strong protection against infection [27, 28] . By comparing a baculovirus vector that could only display HA with a vector that could both display and express HA, we showed that different biases in Th1 and Th2 immune responses were induced. The balance between Th1 and Th2 responses mounted against an infectious agent can influence both the control of the pathogen and immunopathology. Humoral immune responses are essential for immunity against viral infections, but they may not be sufficient to clear the virus [6] . T cell responses, especially Th1-mediated cellular immunity, may also play a crucial role in long-term protection in some cases. Thus, the information provided here might be helpful for the design of effective baculovirus-based vaccines in the future.",
