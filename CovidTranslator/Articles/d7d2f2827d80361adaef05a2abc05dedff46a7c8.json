            "text": "The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the infectious agent responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and represents one of the largest currently known RNA genomes. It is composed of at least 14 functional ORFs, which encode three classes of proteins, i.e., the structural proteins S, M, E, N, 3a, 7a and 7b, the nonstructural proteins nsp1 to nsp16, and the accessory proteins 3b, 6, 8, 9b and 14 (Snijder et al. 2003) . Nsp3 is the largest of the nonstructural proteins. It is predicted to have multiple functional domains (Snijder et al. 2003) , and large parts of this 1922-residue protein have already been structurally characterized. This includes the functional domains nsp3a, which is a singlestranded RNA-binding protein exhibiting a ubiquitin-like fold (Serrano et al. 2007 ), nsp3b, which has been described as an ADP ribose-1''-phosphatase (Saikatendu et al. 2005) , and nsp3d, which contains two structural domains involved in the proteolytic processing of the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, and a third structural domain with a ubiquitin-like fold (Ratia et al. 2006) . Further structure determinations of structural domains within the ''SARS-unique'' functional domain nsp3c are in advanced stages. Despite this progress with the structural and functional characterization, the overall physiological role of the nsp3 protein remains poorly understood and further work is required. Here, we report the sequence-specific NMR assignment of the core structural domain of residues 1066-1181 within the functional domain nsp3e, to establish a basis for a next step of structural and functional characterization of nsp3.",

To focus on the globular domain, we cloned the truncated construct nsp3(1066-1181) into the vector pET-25b and expressed the protein in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-RIL CodonPlus (Stratagene). Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C, induced with 1 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at an OD600 of 0.8, and then grown for another 18 h at 18\u00b0C. For the protein purification, the cells were disrupted by sonication in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, with 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche). The solution was then centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000g and 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was loaded with a flow rate of 1 ml/min onto a 5 ml Hitrap Q SP column (Amersham) equilibrated with 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.5, containing 50 mM NaCl. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 50 to 1,000 mM, fractionated and monitored at wavelengths of 280 and 254 nm. Fractions containing nsp3(1066-1181) were pooled and concentrated to 10 ml using Amicon ultracentrifugal filter devices with 5 kDa cutoff (Millipore). Subsequently, the protein solution was passed through a Superdex 75 sizeexclusion column (Amersham). The fractions containing the protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were again pooled and concentrated to a volume of 550 ll using 5 kDa cutoff Amicon ultracentrifugal filter devices (Millipore).",

The Fig. 2 shows a plot of the deviations of the experimentally observed 13 C chemical shifts from the random coil values, Ddi, versus the amino acid sequence, where Metzler et al. 1993) . A positive value for Ddi indicates that the residue i is located in a regular helical structure, while a negative value indicates that it is located in a regular b-strand. The tentative positions of regular secondary structures, which are identified at the bottom of the figure, were obtained with the criterion that |Ddi| C 1 for three or more sequentially adjacent residues. No information is as yet available on the assembly of the b-strands into b-sheets. (Herrmann et al. 2002a, b) by subtracting the random coil 13 C a and 13 C b shifts from the experimentally determined chemical shifts. The Dd i value for residue i represents a three-point average value over the three consecutive residues i -1, i and i + 1, calculated as follows: Metzler et al. 1993) . A positive value for Dd i indicates that the residue i is located in a regular helical structure, while a negative value indicates its location in a regular b-strand.
