Intriguingly, an underlying mechanism for the suppression of viral infection by ciclesonide has been revealed by the isolation of a drug-resistant mutant 12 . The isolation of the drug-resistant mutant indicated that NSP15, a viral riboendonuclease, is the molecular target of ciclesonide. Together, it is not unreasonable to consider that ciclesonide exhibits a direct-acting antiviral activity in addition to its intrinsic antiinflammatory function. In the future, siRNA targeting the hormone receptor will allow to assess the extent of direct-acting antiviral activity. With its proven anti-inflammatory activity, author/funder.

For viral infection, plates were transferred into the BSL-3 containment facility and SARS-CoV-2 was added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0125. The cells were fixed at 24 hpi with 4% PFA and analyzed by immunofluorescence. The acquired images were analyzed using in-house software to quantify cell numbers and infection ratios, and antiviral activity was normalized to positive (mock) and negative (0.5% DMSO) controls in each assay plate. DRCs were fitted by sigmoidal dose-response models, with the following equation: Y = Bottom + (Top Bottom)/(1 + (IC 50 /X) Hillslope ), using XLfit 4 Software or Prism7. IC 50 values were calculated from the normalized activity dataset-fitted curves. All IC 50 and CC 50 values were measured in duplicate, and the quality of each assay was controlled by Z'-factor and the coefficient of variation in percent (%CV).",
