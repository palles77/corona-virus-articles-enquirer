This mode of inheritance was investigated by mating pigs, resistant and susceptible to the disease, and examining the offspring. Weaned piglets were repeatedly inoculated orally with 5 X 105 CFU per pig per day of a streptomycin resistant strain of E. coli serotype O 139:K12 (B):H 1 :F ( 107 ) and susceptibility determined by daily semiquantitative cultural examination of rectal swabs. Using results obtained from offspring, 5 boars were retrospectively assigned the genotype ss, 1 was assigned Ss, and 2 were assigned SS. Nine sows were designated ss, 8 classified Ss and 4 SS. Ninety two pigs resulted from matings regarded as ssxss; 89 (97%) of these were resistant to colonization and oedema disease. Of the 168 pigs from Ssxss matings, 83 (49%) were resistant, while only 13 (9%) of 146 pigs from matings with at least one SS parent were classified resistant. The results are compatible with inheritance being controlled by one locus and with susceptibility dominating resistance to oedema disease.",

            "text": "Oedema disease of pigs is an enterotoxaemia characterized by generalized vascular damage. The latter is caused by a toxin, Shiga-like toxin-II variant (SLT-IIv), produced by certain strains of E. coli. It occurs widely throughout the world, although incidence changes with time and geographic location (Bertschinger and Nielsen, 1992 ) . In Switzerland, the disease is an important cause of death in weaned pigs. Variable morbidity has been observed within and between individual litters in natural outbreaks (Luke and Gordon, 1950; Timoney, 1950) as well as under experimental conditions (Smith and Halls, 1968; Bertschinger et al., 1986) . However, variable morbidity is not due to inherent resistance to parenterally administered toxin (MacLeod et al., 1991 ) . Smith and Halls (1968 ) , and Bertschinger et al. (1986) reported that resistance to oedema disease is associated with absence of intestinal colonization after oral administration of bacterial cultures. An E. coli strain causing oedema disease colonized the small intestine in a manner similar to enterotoxigenic E. coli (Methiyapun et al., 1984) . In contrast, in pigs experimentally infected with E. coli of human origin producing other types of Shiga-like toxins, colonization occurs in the large intestine and is associated with characteristic changes of enterocytes called \"attaching and effacing\" lesion (Tzipori et al., 1987) . Sellwood et al. (1974) investigated the adherence in vitro of enterotoxigenic E. coli with fimbriae F4 to enterocyte brush borders. They detected that a significant proportion of pigs yielded brush border preparations to which E. coli with fimbriae F4 did not adhere. They suggested that adherence/nonadherence is genetically controlled by two alleles, and that adherence is dominant over non-adherence. Later work by the same group and by other workers confirmed these findings. Oral inoculation of weaned pigs of the adhesive phenotype with E. coli bearing fimbriae F4 results in severe diarrhoea, whereas pigs of the non adhesive phenotype develop no clinical signs and do not excrete the challenge strain (Rutter et al., 1975; Sarmiento et al., 1988 ) . However, suckling piglets with the adhesive phenotype may seem to be resistant to infection, if they receive protective antibodies with the sow's milk (Rutter et al., 1975 , Sellwood, 1979 . Further evidence that adherence and non-adherence may be genetically determined is provided by the finding that fimbriae F4 exist as 3 antigenic variants ab, ac and ad, and in brush-border adhesion tests, each variant binds to a distinct, specific receptor; receptors for each variant are inherited independently (Bijlsma et al., 1982; Rapacz and Hasler-Rapacz, 1986) . Phenotypic resistance of piglets to in vitro adhesion has also been observed with fimbriae F5; however, it is not known if the resistance is of genetic nature (Seignole et al., 1991 ) .",

The boar was found to represent the most significant source of variability (Bertschinger et al., 1986) . This boar effect suggested an underlying genetic determinant for susceptibility. To investigate this \"boar effect\" pigs, both resistant and susceptible to colonization, were mated and the offspring analysed for the degree of susceptibility to colonization. The mode of inheritance observed suggests that resistance to colonization with E. coli bearing fimbriae 107 is inherited as a single recessive trait.",

No pig classified resistant to colonization had to be treated or was affected by oedema disease. On the other hand, a significant proportion of the pigs classified susceptible had to be treated with antimicrobials. Some were so severely affected that they died or had to be killed. This finding emphasizes the reliability of the colonization test. The actual numbers of resistant and susceptible pigs found did not perfectly agree with numbers expected according to Mendelian genetics. Mean faecal scores of resistant and susceptible pigs exhibited considerable overlap, the semiquantitative technique applied to bacterial enumeration may account for some deviation. Furthermore faecal numbers of E. coli may be affected by a multiplicity of factors. Gastric acidity, small intestinal stasis, concentration of bacteria entering the large intestine by fluid absorption, and bacterial proliferation may increase the viable counts with resistant pigs (Smith and Halls, 1968; Sarmiento et al., 1988) . Bacterial colonization of the small intestine of susceptible pigs may be affected by factors reducing the density of bacterial receptors, such as viral infection (Cox et al., 1988) , or factors slowing down bacterial proliferation such as lack of nutrients or antimicrobial substances produced by the bacterial flora of the upper gastrointestinal tract (Axelsson et al., 1989) . However, although satisfactory resuits were obtained, the test used in this pilot study is much too laborious and expensive to be applied on a larger scale for selection of resistant pigs. Searches are underway for appropriate genetic markers as well as for in vitro methods to determine intestinal receptors for fimbriae 107.",

It was not until 3 days after inoculation that very large numbers of the inoculated strain were found in the more anterior regions of the small intestine, and that peak viable counts were attained in rectal contents.

Clinicopathologically, patients may demonstrate any of the following, depending upon the particular organ system affected: elevated serum liver enzyme and bilirubin levels, elevated serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, elevated fibrinogen levels, decreased packed cell volumes, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, or proteinuria. Analysis of blood protein levels may be very helpful. While albumin levels may be normal or decreased, globulin levels are often increased. Serum protein electrophoresis commonly demonstrates a polyclonal gammopathy. In cases of effusive FIP, analysis of fluid obtained by abdomino-or thoracocentesis may be helpful. The fluid is generally yellow (though there may be various degrees of blood-tinging) and viscous with visible strands of fibrin. Fluid analysis should reveal a high specific gravity and elevated protein level, with variable numbers of inflammatory cells. The fluid may clot upon standing. Cerebrospinal fluid may reveal elevated protein levels and increased cellularity when FIP affects the CNS.",
