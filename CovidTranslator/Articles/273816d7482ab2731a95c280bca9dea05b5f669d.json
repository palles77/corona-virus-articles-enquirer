            "text": "Cell death is a key event in physiological, as well as pathological, processes of the immune system. It can be mediated by two principally different mechanisms: apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis refers to a series of morphological changes that occur in dying cells and that are different from the changes seen in necrosis [1] . Unlike necrosis, which mediates cell death by disruption of the plasma membrane and lytic degradation of cytoplasmic organelles, a cell undergoing apoptosis loses volume, the cytoplasm condenses, and the nucleus shows condensation and clumping of the chromatin in parallel with DNA fragmentation. In the final stage, cell fragments pinch off forming so called 'apoptotic bodies'. Biochemically, activation ofintraceUular enzyme systems leads to primary DNA fragmentation, which is later followed by cell lysis [2] . Overall, the cell is lysed without liberation ofproinflammatory degradation products. Before total degradation of apoptotic cells occurs, these cells are taken up by phagocytes thereby limiting the spilling of proinflammatory cytoplasmic contents into the surrounding tissue [3] .",

CD4 + T lymphocytes, which are activated in the circulation, can pass through the blood-brain barrier irrespective of their specific target antigens [5, 6 ]. Yet, most of these T cells will not find the specific antigen in the nervous system and will therefore be rapidly cleared from the CNS parenchyma [6]. However, when T cells that are directed against an autoantigen of the CNS, such as myelin basic protein (MBP), confront their antigen on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the perivascular space, they will home and will be further activated in the nervous tissue ( Fig. 1) . This leads to a cascade of secondary events, such as the upregulation of the production of cytokines and chemokines [7, 8\u00b0,9] , endothelial adhesion molecules [10] [11] [12] , and further induction of the expression of MHC class II antigens on local APCs [13, 14] . These events facilitate the entrance of a secondary wave of leukocytes into the CNS, leading to disease and local tissue damage. Acute EAE is a monophasic disease followed by spontaneous recovery, yet, in certain animal species, a chronic progressive or relapsing disease may develop.",

[24] described that besides oligodendrocytes, in being target cells in the tissue destruction in EAE, T cells in the lesions were also destroyed by apoptosis. With this description, the authors raised, for the first time, the possibility that local apoptosis of T cells in the target tissue could be a way of downregulating inflammation and installing tolerance. This initial observation of the presence of apoptotic T cells in the CNS of animals with EAE was followed by a more detailed study from Schmied et al. [25] who used in situ nick translation in combination with immunocytochemistry to show that, at least in acute monophasic EAE, mainly T lymphocytes and not the cells of the CNS parenchyma were undergoing apoptosis. Furthermore, in this study, quantitation suggested that apoptosis is a very efficient mechanism of T-cell elimination in the lesions. At the time of recovery from the disease, up to 49% of all T cells present showed nuclear changes. These data also indicated that within a 24 hour period, two to sixfold more than the total T-cell population present in the inflammatory infiltrates were destroyed by apoptosis and, thus, that active inflammation could only been maintained by the recruitment of new T cells from the circulation or by local proliferation. More recently, it became clear that the local destruction of T cells is not restricted to EAE, but can also be found in other inflammatory diseases of the nervous system. Several mechanisms may operate in the elimination of T cells. During EAE, a strong corticosteroid response is generated, which leads to the generation of high serum levels of glucocorticoids at the onset of remission (Fig. 1) (Fig. 1) . Preliminary experiments pertbrmed in our laboratories studying the behaviour ofprelabeled encephalitogenic T cells in vivo indeed suggest that it is predominantly the antigen-specific T-cell population that is ehminated by apoptosis in situ.",

Besides the antigen concentration, the kind of APC may also play a role in antigen-induced apoptosis. During EAE, perivascular cells, infiltrating macrophages, microglial cells and astrocytes may act as APCs. For the latter, in recent years, evidence has been obtained that points to a downregulatory role in EAE [37] . These in vivo observations are in line with the in vitro finding that apoptosis of T lymphocytes at late post-activation stage is pronounced when astrocytes are used as APCs, whereas apoptosis is marginal or absent when antigen presentation is accomplished by APCs from the thymus (R Gold, M Schmied, U Tontsch, H-P Hartung, H Wekerle, unpublished data). However, the rate of T-cell apoptosis during EAE in radiation bone marrow chimeric rats is similar to normal rats with EAE, in spite of the inability in these chimeras to present antigen to the transferred T lymphocytes by local astrocytes or microglial cells [38] .",

Whatever the mechanisms are that finally lead to apoptosis of T lymphocytes in the lesions of EAE, the elimination of these cells in the target organ has profound immunological consequences and may explain characteristics of CNS autoimmunity, which so far have remained enigmatic. For instance, it may explain why Ohmori et al. [43] found that in CNS lesions, proliferation of T cells is discontinued rapidly. Moreover, it is generally known that rodents that have gone through one episode of EAE are protected against attempts to induce a relapse by a second immunization. This is against intuition because, in general, primary immunization leads to the expansion of antigen-specific lymphocyte clones and to differentiation of memory cells.",

This has been best shown in Lewis rats and H-2 u mice where, initially, most encephalitogenic (MBP-specific) T cells use the V138.2 + gene for their antigen receptors. During the course of disease, however, these originally dominant T-cell clones are progressively lost [44] . This process is accompanied by the gradual loss of reactivity against the dominant encephalitogenic epitopes, MBP sequence 68-88 in Lewis rats [33, 45] and Acl-10 in H-2u mice [31,32], and a redirected response against additional secondary epitopes [46, 47] , a phenomenon termed (intramolecular) 'epitope spreading' [48] . We propose that both the low MBP-specific T-cell memory formation, as well as epitope spreading, are a direct result of local death (apoptosis) of the encephalitogenic T cells within the target parenchyma. Accordingly, in the Lewis rat, the first wave of V138.2 + (MBP peptide 68-88) specific T cells, which are responsible for the clinical EAE episode, would be eliminated from CNS by apoptosis. T cells specific for secondary, 'cryptic' epitopes would be expanded instead. It will have to be established in the future whether the effective elimination of T cells as seen in both EAE as well as in experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), is a unique mechanism in nervous system immune reactivity or if it is a general mechanism which also functions in autoimmune or infectious diseases of other organs.
