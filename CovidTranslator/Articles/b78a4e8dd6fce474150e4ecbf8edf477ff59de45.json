            "text": "Secondary or tertiary structure in an mRNA, such as a pseudoknot, can create a physical barrier that requires the ribosome to generate additional force to translocate. The presence of such a barrier can dramatically increase the probability that the ribosome will shift into an alternate reading frame, in which a different set of codons is recognized. The detailed biophysical mechanism by which frameshifting is induced remains unknown. Here we employ optical trapping techniques to investigate the structure of a \u00c01 programmed ribosomal frameshift (\u00c01 PRF) sequence element located in the CCR5 mRNA, which encodes a coreceptor for HIV-1 and is, to our knowledge, the first known human \u00c01 PRF signal of nonviral origin. We begin by presenting a set of computationally predicted structures that include pseudoknots. We then employ what we believe to be new analytical techniques for measuring the effective free energy landscapes of biomolecules. We find that the \u00c01 PRF element manifests several distinct unfolding pathways when subject to end-to-end force, one of which is consistent with a proposed pseudoknot conformation, and another of which we have identified as a folding intermediate. The dynamic ensemble of conformations that CCR5 mRNA exhibits in the single-molecule experiments may be a significant feature of the frameshifting mechanism.",

A \u00c01 programmed ribosomal frameshift (\u00c01 PRF) occurs during translation when the ribosome slips backward by one nucleotide and recognizes a different set of codons. Whereas kinetic modeling describes the likelihood of ribosome slippage at each of the discrete steps of the elongation cycle (3), the precise physical mechanisms of frameshifting are not well understood. However, pseudoknot structures located~6-8 nucleotides downstream of a slippery site (4-6) have been found to promote efficient \u00c01 PRF (3, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Pseudoknots occur when a nucleotide sequence forms two or more stem-loop structures that are not well nested (5) ; for examples, see Fig. 1 or Fig. 2 a, where the loop of one stem is incorporated into a second stem. Fig. 1 also defines a typical \u00c01 PRF signal and depicts the ribosome's reading frame (green) before and after a \u00c01 PRF.",

In contrast, the picture emerging from studies of \u00c01 PRF in cellular mRNAs is that frameshift signals direct elongating ribosomes to premature termination codons, leading to degradation of the mRNA through the nonsense-mediated decay pathway ( (19) and A.

The chemokine receptor CCR5 is used by HIV to infect white blood cells (21, 22) and represents a primary drug target for controlling HIV infection (23) . A mutant nonfunctional form of CCR5 confers resistance to some strains of HIV-1 (24) .

For example, some studies using mutants of a single \u00c01 PRF promoting mRNA pseudoknot found a correlation between disruption force and \u00c01 PRF (10, 25) whereas other studies using mutants of different \u00c01 PRF promoting pseudoknots did not (26, 27) . A recent study using nine native pseudoknots also did not identify such a correlation (28) . Regardless, mechanical stability of the mRNA is likely an important factor affecting the kinetics of the translating ribosome complex (29) . Other factors such as ribosomal pausing (30) , pseudoknot unfolding rate (27) , hairpin loop structure (31) , complete blockage of translation by pseudoknots with high mechanical stability (32) , and geometric factors such as stem lengths (33, 34) are all potentially important factors in determining how cis-acting elements affect \u00c01 PRF efficiency.",

In principle, these might represent different disruption pathways of a common structure, or disruption pathways for different initial structures. Black lines represent the wormlike chain model (39) for the handles with and without the 97 bases of the \u00c01 PRF element of the CCR5 mRNA released (42, 43) . Alongside each force-extension curve is an extension versus time plot for the same disruption event and a plot of the rate of change in energy of the structure per unit extension (dE/ dx), calculated as a function of extension using methods described in de Messieres et al. (35) and La Porta (46) . The dE/dx plot is obtained from an individual extensionversus-time-plot and indicates the steepness of the effective energy landscape as the structure is progressively disrupted. The dE/dx plot allows us to distinguish pathways that generate similar disruption forces, but at different points along the disruption pathway. This additional information is potentially important because the pseudoknot is most likely to trigger a frameshift when the ribosome's active site is aligned with the slippery site (5) . Individual dE/dx curves corresponding to each trace (colors) are overlaid on a log density plot (grayscale) showing all dE/dx data taken for the CCR5 mRNA under the same conditions. Each trace is identified with a color type, determined by the specific regions of the dE/dx graph that the trace visits (Fig. 5 ).",

It is based on the assumption that progression along the reaction coordinate can be modeled as Brownian motion over an effective energy landscape and that over small time intervals the system is in quasiequilibrium. The method can be used to reconstruct the complete energy landscape in cases where there are no irreversible transitions or instances where the rate at which the transition progresses exceeds the time resolution of the apparatus. The complete energy landscape can therefore be established for the red pathway ( Fig. 4 d) . However, the \u00c01 PRF element is sometimes observed to make large irreversible transitions (in the blue, green, and yellow conformations, Fig. 4 , ac), where the system appears to occupy distinct quasi-equilibrium states before and after a large irreversible transition. This could indicate that the system has traversed a large barrier in the energy landscape, or that it has jumped to a new branch of the energy surface. In such cases, dE/dx appears to be well defined for subdomains of the reaction pathway, with gaps where little or no data are collected and in which dE/dx cannot be determined. Although gaps in the measured energy landscape make it impossible to determine the energy difference between the initial and final state, the dE/ dx plot provides an unambiguous fingerprint for each event, and gives the shape of the energy surface in those regions of the reaction pathway that are statistically well converged.",

However, these methods typically require statistical analysis of a large sample of transition events and are most readily applied when the system has a single disruption pathway that can be repeatedly measured.

Duplex RNA or DNA typically unzips at~13 pN (43, 52) although this depends on G-C content. The red conformation has the lowest measured force and dE/dx levels, usually <13 pN, and is consistent with a conformation in which the mRNA has formed a weak hairpin with some mismatches, such as the hairpins shown in Fig. 2 , b or c. A similar dE/dx signature is observed under reverse scans when the molecule is allowed to fold slowly (Fig. 6) , consistent with the fact that all of the substeps for the red pathway were observed to be reversible. In contrast to the red conformation, the blue pathway has significantly higher dE/dx values than would be expected for duplex RNA, suggesting the presence of tertiary structure that provides additional stabilization. Tertiary structure can consist of docking between helices and/or loops, or formation of RNA triplex structures. All conformations were dependent on the presence of Mg 2\u00fe (Fig. 7) , providing further evidence of higher-order structure.",

In each disruption of an mRNA molecule it is possible to identify a series of subdisruptions, some of which are reversible whereas others are irreversible. We represent each subdisruption as a point on a scatter plot, where the x axis is the amount of mRNA already released Fig. 8 b illustrates the typical disruption pathway observed for the four conformation types, where doubleended arrows indicate reversible steps and thinner arrows represent transitions that occurred less frequently. A single structure can hypothetically manifest multiple pathways in Fig. 8 b if different parts of the structure disrupt in a different order. In such a case, arrows appearing in Fig. 8 b would be of similar length but appear in a different sequence. This does not seem to be the case in our data, leading us to conclude that the disruption pathways are associated with distinct folding conformations of the mRNA.",

            "text": "Disruption of the high-force blue conformation increases the extension by a length equivalent to 90 bases of single-stranded RNA (Fig. 8) . The amount of RNA bound in the structure being disrupted must be larger than the apparent length of sequence released, because the structure must have a finite extension even when fully folded. A simple hairpin structure has a helix width corresponding to approximately four bases (~2.0 nm) and other structures would likely have equal or larger extension. Therefore the blue conformation includes a minimum of 94 bases of RNA and is dependent on nearly all of the 97 bases of single-stranded RNA in the \u00c01 PRF element, consistent with the Pseudoknot-1 structure shown in Fig. 2 a. To further test the dependence on the full \u00c01 PRF element sequence, we introduced 20-base DNA oligos complementary to either end of the mRNA sequence. The results (Fig. 9 , details in Fig. S2 ) demonstrate that blocking either end of the mRNA depletes the blue pathway, consistent with the Pseudoknot-1 structure (Fig. 2 a) . In contrast, the high-force green conformation was suppressed when blocking the first 20 bases (5 0 end) but not when blocking the last 20 bases (3 0 end). The RNA released by green before reaching the first resistance to disruption (Fig. 4 b  and Fig. 8 ) is therefore released from the 3 0 rather than the 5 0 end. Green represents a structure that does not FIGURE 5 Classification of scans. Conformation type for individual scans was determined by testing whether dE/dx values visited one of the three specified boxes. The choice of box location was refined by optimizing the distribution of substeps, discussed for Fig. 8 a. Samples which visit more than one box were assigned in the following priority: blue; yellow; green. In particular, yellow conformations often visited the green region. Any sample that did not visit one of the boxes was defined as red. This indicates that the green structure would also provide a strong barrier to a ribosome positioned on the slippery site, which would approach from the 5 0 end of the mRNA. The pattern of substeps for the low-force red conformation changed when blocking the first 20 bases (5 0 end) but not the last 20 bases (see Fig. S2 ). Red is therefore more consistent with Hairpin 1 (Fig. 2 b) , which does not include the last 20 bases, rather than Hairpin 2 ( Fig. 2 c) , which does include the last 20 bases. A prevalence of Hairpin 1 over Hairpin 2 is not unexpected because Hairpin 1 (\u00c029.0 kcal/mol) is predicted to be more stable than Hairpin 2 (\u00c025.6 kcal/mol), determined by the web server MFOLD (45) . Yellow was relatively rare and did not have adequate statistics for us to investigate its response to blocking. However, it shows high dE/dx values at partial extension, suggesting significant tertiary structure that does not involve the full sequence of the \u00c01 PRF element. It is possible that yellow is either Pseudoknot 2 or Pseudoknot 3, both of which do not incorporate the full 97 bases (Fig. 2, d or e) . We did not find evidence that any of the four disruption pathways corresponds to disruption of Hairpin 2. One of the two hairpins (Fig. 2 , b and c) may represent the final disruption pathway of the \u00c01 PRF element, regardless of whether a pseudoknot initially formed. Fig. 10 shows the energy of the two hairpins as a function of the number of bases of free RNA, as determined by MFOLD (45) . Only the final stage of disruption is shown, representing hypothetical disruption pathways after~55 bases of RNA have been released. In the blue conformation, there is a pause in the disruption at 67 bases of free RNA (Fig. 8 ) and we expect this to correspond to a local minimum in the energy function. Examination of Fig. 10 shows that the blue substep at 67 bases coincides with a local minimum for Hairpin 2, but is not compatible with Hairpin 1 where a local maximum occurs. The red, green, and yellow pathways in Fig. 8 show a tendency to dwell at 76 bases of free RNA and this corresponds to a broad energy minimum for Hairpin 1. Therefore, the reversible transition exhibited by the other pathways is more compatible with Hairpin 1. Blue has high dE/dx values consistent with tertiary structure (Fig. 4 a) , depends on the full \u00c01 PRF sequence (Figs. 8 and 9 ), and completes its disruption along a path more consistent with Hairpin 2 than Hairpin 1 (Fig. 10) ; these three features make the blue conformation consistent with the Pseudoknot 1 structure in Fig. 2 a where the first stem corresponding to Hairpin 1 (Fig. 2 b) disrupts before the second stem corresponding to Hairpin 2 (Fig. 2 c) . Hairpin 1 occupies the 5 0 end of the \u00c01 PRF element, the side from which the ribosome approaches, which suggests that the disruption pathway in the optical trap experiments is closely related to the ribosome-driven disruption pathway. The observations and conclusions described in this section are summarized in Table 1 .",

The occupancies of the various conformations are expected to depend on both the rate at which the force is decreased and the amount of time the molecule is given to refold (53) . The occupancies are strongly dependent on refolding time, which provides further evidence that the different disruption pathways reflect different initial conformations, rather than different disruption pathways of the same initial conformation (Fig. 11) . Blue initially has low occupancy but becomes the dominant conformation after~30 s of relaxation time. Green initially has high occupancy, which decreases at approximately the same rate that blue increases, suggesting green is a folding intermediate of blue. The red and yellow pathways vary slowly with refolding time, suggesting they are long-lived alternate conformations or that they are in equilibrium with the other observed conformations.",

These techniques provide an energy signature for identifying disruption pathways and classifying individual disruptions, even when the full energy landscape cannot be measured. We find that the CCR5 mRNA occupies an ensemble of relatively stable conformations and by comparing the single molecule data with predicted mRNA structures, we have been able to associate well-defined disruption pathways with specific conformations of the CCR5 mRNA. The blue pathway, which presents the strongest resistance to disruption, is consistent with a predicted pseudoknot structure where the stem closer to the 5 0 end disrupts first. Upon refolding, the mRNA can FIGURE 10 Comparison with predicted structures. We compare the two hairpins from Fig. 2, b and c, and plot the free energy for disruption given by MFOLD (45) .

A structure which folds and unfolds reversibly (i.e., red) seems to be a persistent alternate conformation. The strong resistance to disruption of the pseudoknot structure as well as the fact that the mRNA sequence can occupy an ensemble of relatively stable conformations may be important for the frameshifting mechanism.",
