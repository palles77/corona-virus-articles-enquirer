The development of broad-spectrum antibiotics has led to widespread empiric use without ascertaining the etiology of the infecting microbe. Unfortunately, this approach clashes with the second event, which is the advent of molecular-based microbiology that can identify the causative pathogen rapidly at the point of care. The urinary antigen is a most effective rapid test that has allowed targeted therapy for Legionnaire disease at the point of care. The high specificity (> 90%) allows the clinician to administer appropriate anti-Legionella therapy based on a single rapid test; however, its low sensitivity (76%) means that a notable number of cases of Legionnaire disease will go undiagnosed if other tests, especially culture, are not performed. Further, culture for Legionella is not readily available. If a culture is not performed, epidemiologic identification of the source of the bacterium cannot be ascertained by molecular fingerprinting of the patient and the putative source strain. We recommend resurrection of the basic principles of infectious disease, which are to identify the microbial etiology of the infection and to use narrow, targeted antimicrobial therapy. To reduce antimicrobial overuse with subsequent antimicrobial resistance, these basic principles must be applied in concert with traditional and newer tests in the clinical microbiology laboratory.",

The advent of the quinolones and respiratory tract macrolides has led to a tremendous reduction in the morbidity and mortality from the once-feared Legionnaire disease because of the high mortality seen in the original American Legion outbreak.

An advantage of the urinary antigen test is its simplicity of collection and the rapidity of the test results. These tests are much less influenced by prior antibiotic therapy than sputum culture. Because the specificity is high (99.1%, as shown in the metaanalysis), the message of relevance to the clinician is that when a test result is positive, initiating anti-Legionella antibiotic therapy is imperative. However, as the metaanalysis 1 also has shown, the sensitivity is not as high (74%), even with the more sensitive commercially available tests. At least one-quarter of patients with confirmed legionellosis can have a negative test result. The sensitivity also is affected by the course of the infection. In milder cases, the disease may not be sufficiently advanced such that the amount of antigen in the urine is not detectable. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 12 that the urine antigen test is more sensitive than a culture, we found 15 that when performed properly with selective and dye-containing media, culture is useful as a \"gold standard.\"",

Surprisingly, L longbeachae is common in Australia and New Zealand for reasons that are uncertain. Conse-quently, the urinary antigen is less valuable in these countries. Other serogroups, especially in hospitalacquired infections, also can cause disease, particularly L pneumophila serogroup 6.

Thus, more cases of Legionnaire disease were diagnosed annually in the Pittsburgh area than in most states. 18 Given the recent increase in the incidence of Legionnaire disease in the United States and Europe, 19 -21 there is motivation to reverse this trend and provide public health officials with the opportunity to determine the source of exposure.
