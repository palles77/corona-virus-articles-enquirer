Kinetic studies indicate that in contrast to 3CL pro from other \u2424-CoV 2c members, including HKU4 and HKU5, MERS-CoV 3CL pro is less efficient at processing a peptide substrate due to MERS-CoV 3CL pro being a weakly associated dimer. Conversely, HKU4, HKU5, and SARS-CoV 3CL pro enzymes are tightly associated dimers. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies support that MERS-CoV 3CL pro is a weakly associated dimer (K d \u03f352 M) with a slow off-rate. Peptidomimetic inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CL pro were synthesized and utilized in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments and demonstrate that MERS-CoV 3CL pro undergoes significant ligand-induced dimerization. Kinetic studies also revealed that designed reversible inhibitors act as activators at a low compound concentration as a result of induced dimerization. Primary sequence comparisons and x-ray structural analyses of two MERS-CoV 3CLpro and inhibitor complexes, determined to 1.6 \u00c5 , reveal remarkable structural similarity of the dimer interface with 3CL pro from HKU4-CoV and HKU5-CoV. Despite this structural similarity, substantial differences in the dimerization ability suggest that long range interactions by the nonconserved amino acids distant from the dimer interface may control MERS-CoV 3CL pro dimerization. Activation of MERS-CoV 3CL pro through ligand-induced dimerization appears to be unique within the genogroup 2c and may potentially increase the complexity in the development of MERS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors as antiviral agents.",

The addition or deletion of amino acids, e.g. His 6 affinity tags, at either the N or C terminus drastically reduces the enzymatic rate and decreases the ability of SARS-CoV 3CL pro to dimerize (37) . Although cellular evidence for the auto-cleavage mechanism (cis versus trans) of 3CL pro is lacking, models for how 3CL pro cleaves itself from the polyprotein to form the mature dimer have been proposed based on in vitro studies using purified 3CL pro (34, 39, 40) . A current model posits that two inactive 3CL pro molecules within two separate polyproteins recognize each other and form an immature dimer capable of cleaving the nsp42nsp5 and nsp52nsp6 sites in trans, followed by formation of an active and mature dimer that can then rapidly process other cleavage sites and multiple polyproteins. It has also been proposed that substrate-induced dimerization regulates the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro during virus replication; however, no experimental evidence of this has ever been demonstrated in infected cells (40) . Although our knowledge of SARS-CoV 3CL pro is extensive, the dimerization properties of 3CL pro from MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, as well as the factors regulating their enzymatic activity, remain largely unknown.",

In addition, we utilized our previous knowledge on the design of potent SARS-CoV 3CL pro peptidic inhibitors to design a series of inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CL pro that exhibit low micromolar potency.

To obtain exact molecular weights, sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at concentrations of 3 and 17 M MERS-CoV 3CL pro . The experiments were done at 20\u00b0C utilizing a twochannel centerpiece and run at multiple speeds (8100, 13,800 and 24,000 rpm) in a AN-60 Ti rotor.

Automated model building using Autobuild in Phenix was initially used to build a preliminary model of the MERS-CoV 3CL pro and 6 inhibitor complex.

The strong curvature suggests that a dimer is either the most active form or the only active form of MERS-CoV 3CL pro . To determine the mechanism of dimerization, the data in Fig. 2 were first fit to Equation 1 (see \"Experimental Procedures\"), which describes a model where both the monomer and the dimer are active. A fit of the data to Equation 1 yielded a negative turnover value for the monomer (k cat, M ), suggesting the monomer is inactive and that the dimer is the only active form of the enzyme. Therefore, the data were fit to Equation 2 (see \"Experimental Procedures\"), which considers only the dimer as the active form of the enzyme.

Unlike enzyme kinetics, AUC allows determination of the monomer-dimer equilibrium constant (K d ) in the absence of substrate. MERS-CoV 3CL pro displayed a continuous size distribution at different protein concentrations. Two distinct peaks corresponding to monomer (2.9 S) and dimer (3.9 S) species are observed, with the dimer peak becoming more pronounced at higher enzyme concentrations (Fig. 4A) . We fit the AUC data to a monomer-dimer equilibrium model to determine the values for K d and k off , where K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant for a monomer from the dimer, and k off is the rate constant for dissociation of the monomer from the dimer. The resulting best fit value for K d is 52 \u03ee 5 M and that for k off is 10 \u03ea4 s \u03ea1 . The K d value of 52 M for MERS 3CL pro is dramatically different from SARS-CoV 3CL pro , which has reported K d values ranging from low nanomolar up to 10 M depending on the enzyme construct used and the experimental conditions and methods utilized to determine the dissociation constant (37) .

Peptidomimetic compounds such as compound 6, which contains a Michael acceptor group, interact and react with the active site cysteine of cysteine proteases to covalently modify them. We utilized compound 6 to form a covalent MERS-CoV 3CL pro and inhibitor 6 complex that is stable over long periods of time, making it amenable to analysis by AUC-SV experiments. In contrast, incubation of a normal peptide substrate with the enzyme would lead to immediate hydrolysis of the substrate and dissociation of the products from the enzyme, confounding AUC experiments and subsequent data analysis.",

The MERS-CoV 3CL pro and 11 complex crystallized in space group P2 1 with two biologically relevant dimers in the asymmetric unit. The overall root mean square deviation between the C-\u2423 atoms of the four chains was less than 1 \u00c5, with the highest C-\u2423 root mean square deviation of 0.719 \u00c5 between chains C and D. Strong electron density (F o \u03ea F c \u03fe4) was present for compound 11 within all the four active sites of the two dimers (Fig.  6D) . The binding orientation for compound 11 in the active site of MERS-CoV 3CL pro is similar to the binding orientation of related compounds in the active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro (PDB code 4MDS). The benzotriazole group binds in the S 1 subsite; phenyl propionamidyl occupies the S\u0408 1 -S 2 subsite, and the thiophene group binds in the S 2 subsite. Compound 11 also forms two direct and one water-mediated hydrogen bond interactions with amino acids in the MERS-CoV 3CL pro active site (Fig. 6E) . The N3 of the benzotriazole ring forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain \u2440-nitrogen of conserved His-166, and the central acetamide oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of conserved Glu-169. The NH of the phenyl propionamidyl group interacts with backbone carbonyl oxygen of the catalytic His-41 residue through a water-mediated hydrogen bond, and the imidazole ring of His-41 engages with the phenyl ring of phenyl propionamidyl group through T-shaped stacking. The phenyl ring also form hydrophobic contacts with Leu-49.",

Two arginine residues, Arg-4 and Arg-298 (Fig. 7 , A-C), form some of the key interactions at the dimer interface of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , and mutation of either of these amino acids results in a drastic loss of dimerization in SARS-CoV 3CL pro (36, 38) . Interestingly, these two arginine residues (Arg-4 and Arg-298) are substituted in MERS-CoV 3CL pro by two hydrophobic residues (Val-4 and Met-298) that are unable to participate in the formation of hydrogen bonds or salt bridges. Therefore, we initially thought that the loss of these key interactions might simply explain the \u03fe100,000-fold weaker dimerization observed for MERS-CoV 3CL pro compared with SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Surprisingly, however, structural analysis of the dimer interface from the available x-ray structure of HKU4-CoV 3CL pro (PDB code 2YNB; Fig. 7, B and C) , and primary sequence alignment of 3CL pro from MERS-CoV, HKU5-CoV, HKU4-CoV and SARS-CoV (Fig. 8) revealed that Val-4 and Met-298 are conserved between all the \u2424-CoV 2c members studied here. Substantial differences between the ability of MERS-CoV 3CL pro and HKU4/HKU5-CoV 3CL pro to dimerize, despite their high sequence identity, led us to the hypothesis that nonconserved residues between MERS-CoV and other \u2424-CoV 2c members that are remote from the dimer interface may play a significant role in dimer formation.",

It is noteworthy that Glu-290 forms a salt bridge with Arg-4 across the dimer interface in SARS-CoV 3CL pro .

Because of its indispensable role in the virus life cycle, regulation of the enzymatic activity of 3CL pro is instrumental for efficient replication of coronaviruses.

Based upon these studies and our data on MERS-CoV 3CL pro , we propose the polyprotein processing model in Fig. 10 . The steps proposed for auto-release of MERS-CoV 3CL pro from the polyprotein (steps 1-4, Fig. 10 ) have been adapted from Chen et al. (39) , where it is suggested that the N-terminal auto-processing does not require the formation of a mature 3CL pro dimer for SARS-CoV. Based on the differences between the properties of SARS-CoV 3CL pro and MERS-CoV 3CL pro , as highlighted in our studies, we added two additional steps (steps 5 and 6, Fig. 10 ) that MERS-CoV 3CL pro may need to utilize for efficient polyprotein processing. In Fig. 10, step 1 , two immature MERS-CoV 3CL pro monomers in the polyprotein approach each other and form an immature dimer via interactions between domain III, which allows each of the monomers to insert their N termini into the active site of the other monomer. In step 2, the N termini are cleaved, and the dimer with uncleaved C termini adopts a conformation similar The N and C termini are labeled, and the yellow cylinder labeled S represents a ligand that can be a peptide inhibitor, peptide substrate, or 3CL pro cleavage sites in the polyprotein. Various steps required for the auto-release of 3CL pro from the polyprotein and subsequent processing of the polyprotein cleavage sites are described in the text. Suggested by our AUC and kinetic studies, the shaded region (steps 5 and 6) highlights the additional steps MERS-CoV 3CL pro would undertake during polyprotein processing and have been described in the kinetic model depicted in Fig. 5B. to the mature dimer. Our observation of auto-cleavage of the N-terminal His 6 tag from MERS-CoV 3CL pro during expression in bacterial cells supports steps 1 and 2, where formation of an immature dimer capable of auto-processing the N terminus occurs. In step 3, two dimers with uncleaved C termini approach each other, followed by insertion of the C terminus from one dimer into one of the active sites of the other dimer. In step 4, the C termini are cleaved and mature dimer is released from the polyprotein.",

However, the high K d value of MERS-CoV 3CL pro dimer suggests that the active and mature dimer may dissociate into inactive, mature monomers in the absence of any ligand (step 5). In order for polyprotein processing to proceed, another step (step 6) must occur. In step 6, a substrate S, e.g. one of the 11 polyprotein cleavage sites, would induce dimer formation and hence activate catalysis and cleavage at the substrate recognition sites. Our AUC results and the kinetic activation studies performed in the absence and presence of inhibitors support steps 5 and 6 where the inactive but mature monomers require binding of a ligand to undergo ligand-induced dimerization and formation of an active, mature dimer that can then process the polyprotein cleavage sites.",

Site-directed mutagenesis studies on domain III of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , where N214A and S284A/T285A/I286A mutants were characterized, revealed that despite being present on an entirely different domain, these residues affect catalysis through a network of residues undergoing correlated motions across the entire protease (58, 59) . Utilizing 3CL pro temperature-sensitive mutants of MHV, Stobart et al.

However, upon addition of a ligand, domain III of the R298A mutant adopts the correct orientation and results in the formation of a dimer structure. Similar to the SARS-CoV 3CL pro R298A mutant, ligand binding into the active site of the MERS-CoV 3CL pro monomer possibly stabilizes the inter-domain loop conformation that maintains domain III in the correct orientation for dimer formation. Most of the nonconserved residues within domain III are present on the surface and also are distant from the dimer interface.

Our inhibitory data and K I values clearly show that compounds 6 -9 inhibit all the 3CL pro enzymes tested here. The x-ray structure of MERS-CoV 3CL pro in complex with compound 6 revealed that out of eight direct hydrogen bonds formed between compound 6 and MERS-CoV 3CL pro , four of these hydrogen bonds involve interactions with conserved structural elements of the peptide backbone of the enzyme. Furthermore, the amino acids that form hydrogen bonds with compound 6 through side chain interactions are conserved in all the coronavirus 3CL pro enzymes evaluated here, as well as 3CL pro enzymes from other \u2424-coronaviruses like MHV, OC43, and HKU1.

As a consequence of enzyme activation, the development of an effective antiviral agent may necessitate the development of a compound that can inhibit the MERS-CoV 3CL pro monomer and stabilize it without inducing dimerization and/or inhibit the active sites of the dimer at low doses, ensuring inactivation of both the active sites within the dimer.
