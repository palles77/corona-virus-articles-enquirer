Animals were distributed in 2 groups: COL+ (n = 9) which received fresh colostrum from their own damns; and COL\u2212 (n = 10) which received frozen colostrums from donors. Heifers were assessed before colostrum intake -D0; D2; D7; D14; D21 and D28. Heifers were monitored by clinical examination, hematological profile and serum iron. COL\u2212 had a higher diarrhea intensity score (typically 3) on D7. Moreover, a single case each of bronchopneumonia and navel inflammation were observed in COL\u2212 calves. COL\u2212 had fewer red blood cells (RBC) (6.5 \u00b1 0.8 \u00d7 10 6 /\u03bcL) and less hemoglobin (Hgb) (8.3 \u00b1 1.4 g/dL) than COL+ (RBC = 7.2 \u00b1 0.8 \u00d7 10 6 /\u03bcL; Hgb = 9.6 \u00b1 1.3 g/dL) at D14 (P \u2264 0.05). COL\u2212 had more anemia on D21 (P = 0.03) and on D28 (P = 0.02). Iron was lower in COL\u2212 (5.6 \u00b1 2.7 \u03bcM/L) than COL+ (10.7 \u00b1 6.2 \u03bcM/L) (P = 0.03) on D7. Lymphocytes was lower in COL\u2212 than COL+ on D7 (3.8 \u00b1 1.0 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL COL+ and 5.4 \u00b1 2.2 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL COL\u2212, P = 0.02). COL\u2212 calves had more anemia and lower serum iron concomitant with diarrhea on D7. The number of leukocytes was relatively consistent in the COL+ calves, while COL\u2212 calves showed an increasing number of of lymphocytes starting on D7.",

The neonate must develop functional independence from the protected maternal internal environment after birth. During this adaption process, the initial n\u00e4ive immune system of the calf is enhanced and activated progressively as a result of exposure to microorganisms in the maternal environment. Protection of the neonate during the preweaning period is initially dependent on the transfer of maternal immune factors from colostrum, but undergoes progressive maturation to a fully functional state (Chase et al., 2008) .",

Calves fed colostrum with viable cells had higher number of neutrophils and greater bactericidal activity than calves feed cell-free colostrum. The phenotypic profile of the calves that received cell free colostrum suggested a bias toward pro-inflammatory responses (Reber et al., 2008a (Reber et al., , 2008b . Evidence of specific immune effects of cells from colostrum can be found in an increased of number of blood lymphocytes, enhanced proliferative response to antigen, superantigen and mitogens, and enhanced antibody production after stimulation with antigen in calves receiving viable maternal leukocytes (Riedel-Caspari and Schmidt, 1991a; Riedel-Caspari and Schmidt, 1991b; Donovan et al., 2007) . Moreover, circulating blood mononuclear cells from these animals expressed a greater percentage of activation markers on their surface (Reber et al., 2008a , 2008b , Reber et al., 2006 Langel et al., 2015) . On the other hand, feeding calves fresh colostrum suppressed B cells differentiation in the mesenteric lymph nodes relative to colostrum deprived calves (Aldridge et al., 1998) .",

COL \u2212 calves had a slight higher rectal temperature during most of the investigation, especially between D9 and D16.
