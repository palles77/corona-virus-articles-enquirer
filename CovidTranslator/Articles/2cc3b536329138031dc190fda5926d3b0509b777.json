            "text": "Influenza viruses remain significant causes of ARI every year despite availability of vaccines and increasing efforts to achieve targeted vaccination rates. In 1998, these viruses were estimated to cause 39,000 hospitalizations per year in children nationally in the US. 1 The outpatient visits associated with influenza were reported to be approximately 10, 100, and 250 times as high as hospitalization rates for children 0 to 5 months, 6 to 23 months, and 24 to 59 months of age, respectively. 5 Substantial burden from influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths has been ascertained in several studies, most severely affecting those older than 65 years but also being significant in the 50-to 65-year-old adults, in whom hospitalization rates were determined to equal those among children younger than 5 years. 6 Antigen assays for the detection of influenza are commonly available. The likelihood of a negative result using these assays increases significantly with the increasing age of the patient, whereas virus culture and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) do not; for older patients, RT-PCR or culture is necessary to avoid false-negative results. 7 Molecular methods for detecting influenza viruses were described as early as 1991. Various targets, including the matrix, HA, and N genes have been used. The first commercially available assay was the Hexaplex assay (Prodesse Inc, Waukesha, Wisconsin), an RT-PCR assay that employed enzyme hybridization postamplification detection. The assay was technically demanding, requiring postamplification purification; it was also expensive and took 8 to 9 hours to complete. 8 This assay had an analytical sensitivity of 10 copies for influenza A and 5 copies for influenza B 9 and set the standard for the detection of influenza viruses. Since then, it has been redesigned and is now an FDA-approved multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay (Pro-Flu1, Prodesse Inc,) for detecting influenza A (M gene), influenza B (NS1 and NS2 genes), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (polymerase gene). It can be performed using a MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, Indiana), or the NucliSens easyMAG System (bioMerieux Inc, Durham, North Carolina) for extraction with amplification and detection on the SmartCycler system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California). According to the manufacturer, it has a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 93% for influenza A and 98% and 99% for influenza B, respectively, and an analytical sensitivity of 10 2 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 )/mL for both viruses. The xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) also is an FDA-approved multiplex panel for detecting respiratory viruses. While capable of detecting 17 respiratory viruses, it is FDA-approved for detecting RSV; parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3; metapneumovirus; adenovirus, and rhinovirus, in addition to influenza. The assay employs multiplex PCR and fluid microsphere-based array detection on the Luminex x-MAP system (flow cytometer). It has a reported clinical sensitivity of 100% for influenza A 10 and an analytical sensitivity of 10 TCID 50. 11 In addition to these FDA-approved assays, ASRs for influenza are commercially available from EraGen Biosciences (Madison, Wisconsin) and Cepheid (Sunnyvale, California). These assays have no performance claims made by the manufacturer, and little information is published regarding their performance. The literature is replete with home-brew or in-house developed assays for detecting influenza using various amplification methodologies. In evaluating a home-brew assay or an ASR, an analytical sensitivity of 10 TCID 50 is desirable. In comparison with antigen assays and culture, clinical sensitivity of 98% to 99% should be easily attainable, along with the detection of additional viruses missed by culture. An alternate PCR methodology can confirm these as true positive specimens. PCR-based respiratory virus assays have demonstrated significantly better sensitivity than antigen detection assays, both enzyme immunoassays 7, 12 where adults may have a false-negative rate of up to 29%, 13 and immunofluorescent assays 14 They also have better sensitivity than culture 15, 16 in children 17 and particularly in adults. [18] [19] [20] Several manufacturers have assays available as research use only (RUO) kits. There are several kits, the Multi-Code-PLx (EraGen Biosciences, Inc) and the ResPlex II Panel (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, California), that employ the Luminex system, and these have reported performance claims similar to the xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel. 21, 22, 23 Automated solid film microarray assays also are being developed, 24 but none are commercially available.",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is accepted as the most important respiratory viral pathogen in infants and young children. It long has been recognized to cause the highest number of pediatric hospitalizations from LRI, with estimates of more than 90,000 to 112,000 hospitalizations annually in children younger than 5 years. 1 Subsequent studies have shed light on the enormous outpatient and emergency room burden of illness associated with this virus also. 25 Thus, in addition to causing annual winter epidemics of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children requiring hospitalization, RSV also leads to significant outpatient disease. The virus further has been established as an important pathogen of respiratory disease in the elderly and high-risk adults. 26 Like influenza, the Hexaplex assay was the first commercially available assay for detecting RSV. It had an analytical sensitivity of 42 to 4200 copies 8 and a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 99% and 97%, respectively, in children 12 and 91% and 99% in a mixed population of adults and children. 8 It, too, has been redesigned into the FDAapproved multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay, the Pro-Flu1, which, according to the manufacturer, has an analytical sensitivity of 10 \u00c01 to 10 1 TCID 50 and a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 95%, respectively. In a study of an earlier version performed on pediatric samples, the assay had a sensitivity and specificity of 99% and 100%. 17 The assay has a sensitivity of 95% as compared with 82% for the enzyme immunoassay and 57% for culture. 27 The FDA-approved xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel has an analytical sensitivity of 10 2 TCID 50 /reaction 11 and a clinical sensitivity of 97%. The ASR commercially available from Cepheid has an analytical sensitivity of 12 copies per reaction and a clinical sensitivity of 100% when compared with enzyme immunoassay. A 22% increase in positive patients, however, was seen with the ASR. This increased positivity rate by RT-PCR is consistent with that reported by others when compared with antigen detection methods. 28 In-house assays for detecting RSV have been developed using the F, N, or L polymerase gene targets. These studies report 82% sensitivity of the antigen assay, 29 low sensitivity of culture, 30 Utilization of Nucleic Acid Amplification Assays and an increase in detection of positive patients by RT-PCR. 14, 31 This increased sensitivity of RT-PCR has been reported in immunocompromised adults also. 32 Nucleic acid amplification assays are the most sensitive method for the detection of RSV 30 regardless of the population tested. Specimens with low viral load, as is seen in adults and immunocompromised patients, are more likely to be antigen-negative and RT-PCR positive 14, 27 The MultiCode-PLx RUO assay has reported performance claims similar to the xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel, 21, 34 while the ResPlex II Panel RUO assay has a significantly lower sensitivity of 73%. 22 Automated microarrays are being developed for RSV also. 24",

Detection using real-time PCR methods, however, has been used to detect bocavirus. 48 Although an increasing number of studies have reported detection of bocavirus in patients who have respiratory illnesses, determination of a causal relationship in LRI has been difficult given:",

An extract that contains total nucleic acids is most useful for that type of application. Different systems have differing abilities to recover RNA, DNA, or total nucleic acids. 40, [51] [52] [53] [54] When determining the performance characteristics of laboratory-developed assays or assays employing ASRs, the performance characteristics of the extraction system also must be documented.

It also decreases the turnaround time of the assays. Real-time detection most often employs target specific probes, thus also increasing the specificity of the assay. Various probe chemistries and labels are available. The choice of probe format and label often is determined by the detection platform employed. Spectral overlap of fluorescent labels, however, also limits the number of multiplex target detection options. Thus, real-time detection is extremely useful; however, it is not adaptable to broad range multianalyte screening. To improve amplification efficiency and expand multiplexing ability, postamplification detection must be employed. Postamplification detection requires handling of amplicon and significantly increasing turn around time. The advantage is the ability to detect multiple pathogens in a single assay. Because of the large number of viruses capable of causing similar symptoms in patients, the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections seems uniquely suited for this application. Solid-phase microarrays allow for a large number of probes to be employed and also may allow for variable hybridization conditions such that detection of a large number of targets or mismatched targets can be accomplished. Suspension microarrays employ a liquid phase bead conjugated array. These allow for rapid hybridization conditions and flexibility in assay design. Bead makeup can be modified easily. Although no automated microarray system is approved by the FDA, these systems have the potential to decrease hands on technologist time; however, it currently is at the cost of turnaround time. 21 ",
