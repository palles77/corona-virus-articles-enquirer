            "text": "After finalisation of the guidelines on March 10, 2020, the coordinator of the group (BY) was interviewed by HCSP on March 11, 2020. The guidelines were adopted and published by HCSP on March 14, 2020. The preparation of these guidelines is justified by data 1 suggesting patients with cancer are at high risk of respiratory complications related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The susceptibility of patients with cancer to influenza was described 2 before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. For patients with cancer infected with influenza, the risk of hospital admission for respiratory distress is four times higher, and the risk of death ten times higher than patients without cancer. This exacerbation seems to be particularly marked in those with neutropenia or lymphopenia, a feature commonly seen in patients with cancer treated with multiple therapies. 2 A Comment 1 from Wenhua Liang and colleagues, published in The Lancet Oncology, on the situation in China suggests that patients with cancer are at higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 than the general population (1% of patients with COVID-19 in the study had cancer, whereas the incidence of cancer in the Chinese population is 0\u00b729%), which could be related to the closer medical follow-up of these patients. More concerning is the increased risk of severe respiratory complications requiring time in the intensive care unit in patients with cancer, as compared with patients without cancer (39% vs 8%, respectively; p=0\u00b70003). A covariate signifi cantly associated with this risk was a history of chemotherapy or surgery in the month preceding infection (odds ratio 5\u00b734, 95% CI 1\u00b780-16\u00b718; p=0\u00b70026), a factor that includes the majority of patients with cancer. Finally, patients with cancer deteriorated more rapidly than those without cancer (median time to severe events 13 days vs 43 days; p<0\u00b70001; hazard ratio 3\u00b756, 95% CI 1\u00b765-7\u00b769).",

The basic principle is for patients with cancer and oncology or radiotherapy departments to avoid-as much as possible-any contact with people with coronavirus disease 2019 . Oncology and radiotherapy departments should ideally remain COVID-19-free sanctuaries. The admission of patients with COVID-19 in oncology or radiotherapy departments should be avoided. If, despite this principle, such patients were admitted to hospital in oncology or radiotherapy departments, they should be isolated from other patients with cancer and referred to departments specialised in the fight against COVID-19 as quickly as possible.",

Any measures that would enable management of patients with cancer at home should be encouraged. This includes telemedicine and phone calls to replace safety visits, as well as replacement of intravenous drugs with oral drugs (eg, chemotherapy and hormone therapies) where possible, along with infrastructure and logistics to allow home administration of intravenous and subcutaneous anticancer agents. Adjustment of dosing schedules of chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatments can be considered to reduce the frequency of hospital admissions (eg, every 3 weeks, rather than weekly administration, of the same regimens or hypofractionated radiotherapy). Moreover, some patients with slowly evolving metastatic cancers could be given temporary breaks in their treatment at the discretion of the referring oncologist, with disease assessment extended to every 2-3 months, to avoid hospital admissions.",

Patients with cancer who have symptoms of COVID-19 should be referred to departments specialised in the fight against COVID-19. To protect patients with cancer, open-space chemotherapy outpatient centres should integrate separation measures (eg, minimum space between seats, mobile walls, wearing of masks by patients and staff).",

If access to hospital cancer care is reduced because of requisition of facilities for management of patients with COVID-19, or if the likelihood of viral infection and life-threatening complications were deemed too high, a selection of patients to be admitted to hospital for cancer treatment, prioritised by type of care or treatment, might be required. The prioritisation in the management of patients will integrate the essence of curative or non-curative intent therapeutic strategy, age of patients, life expectancy, time since diagnosis (eg, early setting recently diagnosed or firstline treatment, or late setting in patients who have been treated with multiple lines of chemotherapy), and symptoms. The following priority order is proposed (but remains at the discretion of the patient's clinician and team): (1) patients with cancers managed with curative intent treatments (favouring those patients aged \u226460 years or life expectancy \u22655 years, or both); (2) patients with cancers managed with non-curative intent treatments, and aged 60 years or younger, or life expectancy of 5 years or more, or both, and in firstline of the therapeutic strategy (early setting); and (3) other patients with cancers managed with noncurative intent treatments, favouring those whose cancerous lesions extend or whose symptoms might jeopardise their lives quickly in the case of treatment discontinuation. Patients with cancer who need to be hospitalised for supportive care (eg, pain management, bacterial infection, or palliative care before death) could be referred to non-specialised cancer departments, or home care.",

If hospital admission is deemed necessary, the patient should be admitted to departments involved in the fight against COVID-19 so that oncology and radiotherapy departments remain COVID-19-free sanctuaries. For patients with cancer without COVID-19, hospital admission for in-patient cancer care should be minimised, and management at home favoured. In a situation where available care facilities are scarce, prioritisation should involve the patients managed with curative-intent therapeutic strategies, and those with a life expectancy of 5 years or more, acknowledging that final decisions lie with the referring clinicians. Patients with cancer should be closely monitored owing to their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
