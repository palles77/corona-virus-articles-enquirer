The aim of this study was to determine the influence of saw blade frequency and contact load, bone condition, test environment, and saw blade type, on the production of aerosol particles. A custom test setup was designed, manufactured and used in 8 bone sawing experiments, using a particle counter to determine the production of aerosol particles while varying the 5 chosen parameters. The number of counted particles was highest with higher saw blade frequencies, lower saw blade contact loads, in dry completely skeletonized bone compared to fresh bone, and using an electrical oscillating saw compared to hand-sawing. Under all conditions, the high amount of aerosol counted posed potential health risks. The ventilation system that we tested was adequate in removing the produced particles, but these high-tech systems are not always available in developing countries or emergency situations. The production of aerosols can be reduced by optimizing the sawing parameters. However, even the lowest number of aerosol particles counted during the current study was high enough to cause potential health risks to practitioners. Safety precautions should be taken, such as external ventilation, proper breathing gear, and adequate protocols, to truly minimize the risk in all bone sawing scenarios.",

Although cutting incidents with sharps or needles are well known health hazards, inhalation of surgical smoke or aerosols (solid or liquid airborne particles) produced by tools is often overlooked and can lead to, for example, respiratory irritations, transmission of infections, and genotoxicity [1] . Safety awareness for high risk airborne transmissible pathogens such as tuberculosis (TB) [2] or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) does exist [3] , however, the health risks associated with the aerosolization of pathogens in the skin, blood or other bodily material remain uncertain. These aerosolized pathogens could include Hepatitis B and C, Streptococci, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), of which airborne transmissions are rare but have been reported or proven plausible during surgery or autopsy sessions [4] . Additionally, non-pathogen-carrying aerosols can pose health hazards when inhaled and deposited in the airways, as with industry smog, car exhaust gas, cigarette smoke or urban pollution [5] .",

The fine particles are within the respirable range and can cause harm to the respiratory tract, or potentially transfer harmful pathogens. It was found that active ventilation within the tested autopsy table can remove nearly all of these aerosol dust particles from the air. A proper choice of sawing parameters could minimize the production of aerosols: sawing by hand using a sharp, fine toothed hacksaw was found to be the best option. When an electric oscillating saw is used, decreasing the saw blade frequency or increasing the saw blade contact load can be used to minimize aerosol production. However, even for the Fig. 3 Typical results over 6 min of particle counting in experiment 5. Note that the vertical axis is logarithmic parameters with the lowest production this intrinsic decrease in particles is slight, and the number of aerosol bone particles that are produced still pose a serious health hazard to anyone near the sawing site. Adequate protective breathing gear, ventilation systems and safety protocols should be used to minimize the risks faced by practitioners.",

The influences of saw blade frequency, saw blade contact load, saw type, bone type and sawing environment on the production of aerosol bone dust particles was tested in 8 experiments. 3. A lower number of particles was counted with lower saw blade frequencies, higher saw blade load, in fresher bone, and using a hand-saw instead of an electrical saw, but was still high enough to be hazardous. 4. Active ventilation can remove nearly all produced bone aerosols, but might not be generally available and should be tested under more stressing circumstances. 5. Sawing in bone should only be done when adequate protective breathing equipment, ventilation systems, and safety protocols are used to minimize the risks faced by practitioners.",
