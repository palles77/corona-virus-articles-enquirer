Once upon a time \" retrovirus \" was pretty clear and referred to a group of viruses with two copies of polyA \u03e9 genomic RNA in the virion. Their genetic bauplan was three orfs, gag-pol-env , bounded by two long terminal repeats (LTRs). The situation was complicated a little with the identifi cation of endogenous retroviruses in the mid-1970s and thoroughly disjointed by the discoveries in 1982 and 1983 that both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and caulifl ower mosaic virus (CaMV) replicate by way of an RNA intermediate. The infectious form of both of these viruses is DNA. However, given that the history of \" retroviruses \" goes back to the early 1900s, that they induced cancer, while the remarkable phenomenon of reverse transcription that broke \" The Central Dogma \" of the day, i.e. DNA makes RNA makes protein, was established using these oncogenic retroviruses, classical \" retrovirology \" understandably had the advantage of terrain.",

Prior to HIV, the key retroviruses were oncogenic, otherwise known as the avian and murine leukemia viruses (ALV and MLV) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) . The discovery in 1980 of human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) associated with 13 C H A P T E R adult T cell leukemia virus fi tted the bill, so all was well. However, with the isolation of HIV-1, a lentivirus, and a major new disease, AIDS, indeed the infection of a generation, everything changed. It coincided with an unprecedented fi repower in molecular biology that has led us to generate almost more data than we know what to do with. Within 2 years of isolation detection kits became available, with the fi rst designer antivirals appearing by 1995. HIV is the number 1 virus for the Journal of Virology . The younger generations of students know little of ALV, MLV, and MMTV. As ever such a magnet can warp vision, and anything and everything new is tried and tested on HIV, a little like the involvement of every new virus in multiple sclerosis ( Vandvik and Norrby, 1989 ; Winkelmann, 1993 ; Ablashi et al. , 2000 ) .",

            "text": "Retroviruses are enveloped viruses composed of a lipid bilayer surrounding a nucleocapsid within which resides the two copies of genomic plus stranded genomic RNA. Understandably the genome must code for capsid and envelope proteins. Given the provirus, the integrated DNA replication intermediate, a reverse transcriptase and integrase are called for. It turns out that three open reading frames (orfs) are suffi cient to generate a fully functional retrovirus. Retroviral genetic maps are invariably given in the proviral form because it is that of the gene ( Figure 13 .1 ). With the signal exception of the spumavirus group of retroviruses, the provirus is a single, multiply spliced gene. The words gene and orf are used interchangeably in retrovirology which is, of course, an abuse of language. The convention is that genes/orfs are referred to in italics while the corresponding proteins are given in normal type. The gag orf encodes the nucleocapsid proteins in the form of a polyprotein precursor. gag is followed by pol , encoding a large polyprotein incorporating the mature reverse transcriptase; RNase H and integrase proteins. Maturation of the polyproteins is the accomplishment of the viral protease that is generally part of pol , but can exist in a separate orf termed pro located between gag and pol. Uniquely for Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is the protease attached to the C-terminus of the Gag polyprotein. The third orf is env , and encodes a polyprotein envelope precursor that is matured by host cell proteases. For ALV, MLV, and MMTV, the historical benchmark retroviruses, gag is always followed by pol which is always followed by env , and gag-polenv represents the lowest common denominator for retrovirus genome organization. However, as can be seen from Figure 13 .1 , this effective yet minimalist view of retroviral genomics is far from common. The most complex retroviruses bear up to nine distinct orfs encoding 15 mature proteins. Some orfs are unique to a virus, others common to a cluster. Some orfs are apparently analogues even though there is no sequence identity between them. While the gag-pol-env synteny is never violated, a multitude of orfs can separate pol and env . Frequently env is followed by 1-4 orfs, although an orf preceding gag is rare.",

When making retrovirus-wide comparisons of the common gag , pol , and env orfs, the internal order of the major proteins is invariably conserved.

As can be seen, it always precedes the reverse transcriptase/ RNaseH ( Figure 13 .2A ). However, the coding sequences can be part of gag , pol or in a separate reading frame, called pro. In view of this it is not surprising to learn that there are several distinct mechanisms by which these distinct reading frames are connected. The mechanisms range from \u03ea 1 ribosomal frameshifting once, twice, splicing, and suppression of a terminator codon. If the larger family of retroelements are considered for once, there are two additional Gag-Pol syntenies involving \u03e9 1 ribosomal frameshifi ng and the two being part of one long polyprotein precursor.

For the lentiviruses, it fi ts snugly in phase between the RT/ RNaseH and integrase coding regions, while for the MMTV/SRV group it is located upstream of the viral protease. While phylogenic analysis shows that they cluster together, they do not constitute a robust monophyletic group, meaning that it is not possible to distinguish between a single introduction or independent introductions into each group ( McGeoch, 1990 ) . This is the only example of radical change in the synteny of retroviral coding sequences. Of course for large DNA viruses, such as the mycophages, marine phaeoviruses, and herpesvirus, to name but three, extensively rearranged genomes are commonplace ( Weir, 1998 ; Delaroque et al. , 2003 ; Pedulla et al. , 2003 ) .",

            "text": "When it comes to making replication errors, DNA and RNA virus differ hugely. RNA viruses are unable to undertake proofreading or mismatch repair while DNA viruses can, either because DNA replication is performed by the host cell or else the genome is large enough to encode the necessary enzymes to undertake high-fi delity replication. In this latter context, poxviruses replicating in the cytoplasm is perhaps the most extreme example. Where do retroviruses, half DNA, half RNA viruses sit when it comes to error? Errors made during reverse transcription per se are not corrected whatsoever, while those made during plus-strand synthesis could be proofread when the DNA is translocated to the nucleus. It turns out that although retroviral mutation rates are in the range of 0.3-0.05 per genome per cycle ( Mansky and Temin, 1995 ; Mansky and Wisniewski, 1998 ; Mansky, 2000 ) , Not only is the pro coding region in different reading frames, the mechanism by which it is expressed in the form of a Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor is radically different. (B) The dUTPase coding sequence is found only in a subset of retroviral genomes and then not consistently. For example, all the primate lentiviruses do not carry a dUTPase. they are approximately an order of magnitude lower than those for RNA viruses, 1-3 per genome per cycle ( Drake and Holland, 1999 ) . While it would be tempting to ascribe this difference to proofreading of mutations of the plus-strand errors, as more errors are made during minus-strand synthesis, it probably refl ects some subtle intrinsic difference between the polymerases. As in almost all polymerases, transitions are produced more readily than transversions, while deletions are more frequent than insertions (essentially duplications). For the HIV reverse transcriptase and presumably the lentiviruses as a whole, deletions arise more frequently than for other RTases. Being diploid viruses, recombination is to be reckoned with. Retroviral recombination goes back to 1971 ( Vogt, 1971 ; Kawai and Hanafusa, 1972 ; Weiss et al. , 1973 ) just one year following the description of reverse transcription. It occurs essentially by a copy choice mechanism ( Coffi n, 1979 ). Precise recombination rates have been worked out for two retroviruses, HIV-1 and MLV, the values being 3-4 per virus per cycle respectively for both viruses, despite an initially lower rate for MLV ( Jetzt et al. , 2000 ; Zhuang et al. , 2006 ) . Importantly, these values are \u03f3 10-100 \u03eb the point mutation rate for both retroviruses. This means that as soon as a point mutation is made it will be recombined in the following round.",

Second, it means that HIV virions are non-clonal objects. Worse, these non-clonal structures are ephemeral as production, infection and reverse transcription involving recombination are a matter of 10-18 hours ( Figure 13 .3 ). Such complexity inside a single nucleus (synonymous here with boundary or discrete volume) indeed conjures up the quasispecies. Indeed, is this the true quasispecies where genomes and gene products clearly interact? The population of genomes is of course limited to two or at most eight functional genomes, which can produce a rich variety of heterokaryons. However, they will recombine in the next round of infection producing a new ensemble of recombinant genomes. This leads to the third point. How is fi tness maintained? Perhaps this question should be rephrased into a more prosaic form, what fraction of recombinants is neutral and what fraction deleterious? The concise answer is we simply don ' t know. However, when recombinants of HIV and SIV are made the resulting \" SHIV \" that is eventually recovered invariably carries \" additional \" substitutions as though the jump in sequence space made by the molecular virologist landed the SHIV in a relatively unfi t region. It seems possible that most recombinants may in fact reduce fi tness. Certainly, it seems logical given that functional sequence space can represent only a small fraction of total sequence space. Could the retroviral for HIV, no matter the multiplicity of infection, the disease stage, or the nature of existing immune responses?",

Briefl y, these are cellular cytidine deaminases that if packaged into the virion can edit hundreds of cytidine residues, leaving behind uracil. This is tantamount to a host restriction system. It is particularly a problem for the lentiviruses to the point that they have evolved the vif gene that prevents APOBEC3 incorporation ( Sheehy et al. , 2002 ) . While other retroviruses including HBV do undergo editing in vitro and in vivo ( Mahieux et al. , 2005 ; Suspene et al. , 2005 ; Delebecque et al. , 2006 ) , there is no evidence that this seriously impacts their replication. For the mouse there is a single APOBEC3 gene and knockout mice are both viable and fertile, which suggests that it does not restrict the transposition of endogenous retroviruses ( Mikl et al. , 2005 ) . This fi ts in well with the fact that although the bird genome carries a plethora of endogenous retroviruses, there is no APOBEC3 counterpart ( Harris and Liddament, 2004 ) . Might a little APOBEC3 editing help the lentiviruses evolve? Could it occasionally act as the equivalent of a bacterial mutator? As is frequently the case, speculation is understandably inversely proportional to the amount of data. Red Queen be constantly running to make up for the devastating effects of recombination? Could this be the major driving force leading to the relentless accumulation of point mutations",

To get this quickly out of the way, the retroviral surface envelope protein is generally the most variable, although some of the small accessory proteins fi x mutations at a comparable rate. The nucleocapsid Gag proteins are understandably less tolerant of change only in the temporal sense, while the enzymes that make up Pol bring up the rear. The retroviral integrase has the lowest amino acid fi xation rate and so it not a surprise that this region is invariably used to perform retrovirus-wide phylogenic analyses. A typical phylogenic tree based on the integrase gene is shown in Figure 13 .4A . However, there is a complication. Between retroviruses, fi xation rates vary hugely. For the lentiviruses, read HIV/SIV simply because the databases are so much larger, the amino acid fi xation rates are of the order of 0.1-1% per year depending on the protein ( Johnson et al. , 1991 ) . For HTLV overall fi xation rates are more like 1% per century while for the foamy viruses or spumaviruses it estimated that the rates could be as slow as \u03f3 2% per million years ( Switzer et al. , 2005 ) . Obviously this cannot be ascribed to the RTase as the HTLV point mutation rate is \u03f3 7 \u03eb 10 \u03ea 6 per base per cycle ( Mansky, 2000 ) which is only four-fold down on that for HIV ( \u03f3 3 \u03eb 10 \u03ea 5 ). It transpires that viruses of the HTLV family replicate a little by reverse transcription and extensively by Tax-driven clonal expansion of the host cell, i.e. mitosis. Tax is a viral protein that impacts the cell by tripping it into cycling even during the non-malignant carrier state. Quite why the foamy viruses fi x mutations so slowly has not been clearly worked out, yet it might well involve clonal expansion, as the consensus opinion is that retrovirus and RNA polymerase complexes are not accompanied by proofreading enzymes.",

There is the implicit assumption that lineages are lengthening at roughly equal rates. However, when the rates differ by several orders of magnitude scalar trees hide information. If the lentiviral and HTLV and normalized to the spumavirus lineage as a function of their fi xation rates, then both the large and diverse lentivirus group as well as the small HTLV group collapse to next to nothing ( Figure 13 .4B ).

One example will suffi ce: feline immunodefi ciency virus produces profound immunodefi ciency and an AIDSlike disease in domestic and big wild cats. A simple alignment of the envelope polyprotein precursor from the PPR and Pallas cat isolates shows a stunning 10% match for the complete Env sequence ( Figure 13 .5 ) and approaches the 5% expectation value given 20 amino acids. Despite this both bear all the hallmarks of a lentiviral envelope sequence-they are highly glycosylated, rich in cysteine residues, have a long cytoplasmic tail and contain the requisite three hydrophobic segments. In general for retroviral proteins, the envelope proteins are the most divergent while the enzymes encoded by pol are the least variable. Thus the rate of fi xation of integrase is perhaps a factor of 10 less than for envelope ( Johnson et al. , 1991 ) .

Nonetheless they show that recombination can sometimes account for up to 50% of all substitutions in a sequence set ( Wain-Hobson et al. , 2003 ) . For HIV, the simplest conclusion was that the number of true mutations in a set of PCR-derived sequences is equal to the number of variable sites.",

That HTLV-1 replicates mainly via mitosis reconciles the problem of the simultaneous occurrence of high proviral load with genetic stability as proviral synthesis is accomplished essentially by the host cell replication machinery, which is endowed with proofreading systems. However, this raises another problem: how does a clonally expanded infected cell produce little virus? Here the answers are less complete. Intrinsically, HTLV-1 production is low compared with that of HIV and is an inevitable consequence of their different genome organization ( Figure 13 .6 ). Both HIV and HTLV-1 encode analogous viral transcription transactivators, Tat and Tax, and temporal regulators of splicing, Rev and Rex respectively. The regulator proteins have a negative effect upon Tat and Tax which also curtails expression of the genomic RNA, and the large mRNA encoding the key virion proteins, Gag, Pol, and Env. HIV encodes both a Rev-dependent and -independent tat mRNA ( Figure 13 .6 ) allowing continual Tat-driven transcription and Rev co-ordinated splicing, and consequently continued expression of virion, gag and pol mRNAs. By contrast, the HTLV-1 analogues Tax and Rex are encoded by the same mRNA ( Figure 13 .6 ). Thus Rex tends to increase Gag, Pol, and Env expression at the expense of both Tax and Rex. The result is an equilibrium with greatly reduced virus production. In short, via genome organization, molecular switches with negative feedback loops can be generated which grossly impact the way a virus replicates and evolves. One fi nal point must be added; the Tax-transactivated HTLV-1 promoter is much less powerful than the Tat-transactivated HIV-1 LTR.",

The retrovirus is produced but unable to infect its own cells, a simple example of negative selection against insertional gene inactivation. As can be seen the majority of these mammalian ERVs are clustered into two groups for which there are exogenous retroviral counterparts.

Equally there is no doubt that some ERVs can escape their host and infect another species, the case of gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) being exemplary. Its closest relative is a murine ERV ( Wolgamot et al. , 1998 ) . While there were numerous reports of endogenous counterparts to the lentiviruses, foamy virus, the alignments were borderline ( Cordonnier et al. , 1995 ) . A recent and glorious surprise is afforded by the aptly named sequence RELIK, for rabbit endogenous lentivirus, where the K refers to the tRNA lysine (K) primer used to initiate reverse transcription . Through a bioinformatics analysis a number of extensively degraded copies of an endogenous retrovirus were identifi ed in the rabbit genome. After careful reconstruction of a consensus sequence it transpired that these relics were those of an endogenous lentivirus, the fi rst unambiguous example to date ( Figure  13 .1 ). A simple comparison of the genome organization with named orfs is enough to convince. What is so nice about RELIK are the fi ne details that any lentivirologist would pick up in a moment. For example, the envelope protein is highly glycosylated, full of cysteine residues, has a furin-like cleavage site and encodes a long intracytoplasmic tail. It encodes a dUTP sequence precisely located between RTase/RNaseH and integrase ( Figure  13 .2 ). The primer-binding site (tRNAlys3) and polypurine tract are typical of a lentivirus.",

Other workers have been calculating consensus or ancestral sequences for the HIV-1 envelope protein in the hope of making an immunogen that is equidistant to a maximum number of strains circulating worldwide. Chemical synthesis of the entire coding sequence and cloning into an expression vector generated functional envelope proteins that were remarkably \" HIV-like \" ( Nickle et al. , 2003 ; Rolland et al. , 2007 ; Kothe et al. , 2007 ) . Of course, the ultimate in this area is the complete chemical syntheses of an infectious molecular clone of poliovirus ( Cello et al. , 2002 ) and subsequently X174. The interesting evolutionary point here, which is a general one, is that total chemical synthesis of a virus, or \" therapy, \" of a partly degraded retrovirus constitutes a hiatus in Darwinian evolution. The mantra has always been \" descent with modifi cation, \" and with reason. Otherwise stated there is an uninterrupted series of DNA replication rounds linking this author to one of the earliest singlecelled DNA organisms fl oating around 3 billion years ago. Total chemical synthesis takes biological evolution into the realm of cultural evolution, something totally new. While the resulting viruses are poliovirus and X174, from an evolutionary setting where biology and history are inseparable, they are worlds apart. No other discipline is as advanced.

Basically sequence space is so huge and multidimensional that simple two-dimensional constructs cannot do justice to the complexity. While not shown here, many of the bootstrap values are rather small, indicating that parts of the tree, particularly towards the root, are not robust ( Renoux-Elbe et al. , 2002 ) . It should perhaps be mentioned that the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K encodes a rev -like orf. It is of course tempting to conclude that rev appeared before tat. While it is satisfying that HERV-K is found in the twilight zone not too far from the lentiviruses, given the low bootstrap values it is not possible to be more precise.",

The standard retroviral tree concerns the accumulation of point mutations while the \" unconventional \" tree concerns the accumulation of novel features. That the general branching orders coincide suggests that the acquisition of novelty inevitably accompanies the remorseless accumulation of point mutations. As any retrovirus radiates through sequence space it will inevitably accumulate novel features along with massive numbers of point mutations. As the lentiviruses sport the highest fi xation rates of any retrovirus, organizational novelty is to be expected here, and probably with the accompanying HIV-1 pandemic more than anywhere else. It transpires that almost every small equatorial African monkey harbors a distinct SIV, albeit pathogenic. To date there are \u03fe 34 SIVs if not more ( Van Heuverswyn et al. , 2006 ) . Through hunting and butchering it is eminently reasonable to postulate yet another zoonotic transmission, and perhaps secondary transmission between humans. While a HIV-3 cannot be ruled out, it seems hard to beat HIV-1 that has in the space of a half-century climbed to the top of the virological Richter scale ( Hale et al. , 2001 ; Weiss and McMichael, 2004 ) .",

There is one unfortunate \" experiment \" that was unwittingly performed on humans and yet, fortunately, did not take off. With the identifi cation of SV40 in rhesus macaque primary kidney cultures, manufacture of the attenuated Sabin strains of poliovirus was switched to African green monkey (Agm) kidney cultures. It is no secret that the incidence of SIVagm in some troops of Agms can be as high as 70%. As there was no inactivating step in the vaccine preparation, some individuals must have received SIVagm. Yet HIV-1 simply is not derived from any SIVagm of any sort despite the fact that some strains can grow on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( Gautam et al. , 2007 ) . It was, as Robin Weiss remarked, a close shave.",

Certainly studies show that an attenuated SIV vaccine can contain the challenge virus despite a certain degree of envelope variation ( Johnson et al. , 1999 ; Blancou et al. , 2004 ) . However, breakthrough does occur when more diverse challenge strains are used. There are simply not enough data to be more precise on the degree of variation. Superinfection by HIV-1 is often given as proof that vaccination will not work. This is not the same as vaccination. It is increasingly clear that during the very early stages of infection there is a loss of HIV/SIV-specifi c immunity, meaning that a seropositive individual is not the same as a vaccinated volunteer.

With the massive effort devoted to sequencing complete genomes, more endogenous retroviruses will be described in less familiar species, and why not clear counterparts to HTLV and spumaviruses? The koala endogenous retrovirus is an interesting case in point ( Gifford, 2006 ) , although there must be many more. Although there are a handful of retroviruses in fi sh, the aquatic world is so diverse, that there must be many more. Concerning extant retroviruses, the lentiviruses represent the most diverse or complex group. As their fi xation rates are so high, the probability is higher that new surprises will show up within this group rather than others. The biologist J.D. Bernal remarked almost 50 years ago that \" everything that can happen will happen, and nobody will be safe from it. \" While I would not share the rather dark 3 \u0408 end to his remark because we now can, after all, vaccinate against a large number of microbes and successfully treat one human cancer out of two, the 5 \u0408 part is a good pr\u00e9cis of retrovirus evolution.",
