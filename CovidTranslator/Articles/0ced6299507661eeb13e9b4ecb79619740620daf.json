ADEM forms one of several categories of primary inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the CNS. Others include multiple sclerosis (MS), optic neuropathy, acute transverse myelitis, and neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease). 1 ADEM has an estimated annual incidence of 0.8 per 100,000 with a median age of onset of 6.5 years. 2 Although ADEM can occur at any age, it is more common in children. Optic neuropathy and ADEM are rare complications associated with vaccinations. 1, [3] [4] [5] Most case reports describe patients experiencing a unilateral or bilateral optic neuropathy or ADEM, rather than simultaneous onset of both conditions. Optic neuropathy has also recurred in one patient after repeat administration of the influenza vaccination. 4 The presumptive mechanism is immune-mediated demyelination although immune-complex mediated vasculopathy has also been postulated. 5 Spontaneous recovery or improvement after corticosteroids has been reported for post-vaccination optic neuropathy and ADEM 3 although permanent visual loss has also been described. 5 We present a review of ADEM with particular emphasis on vaccination as the precipitating factor. We searched the literature using Medline , EMBASE and PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez) with the following search terms: ''ADEM\", ''acute disseminated encephalomyelitis\", ''post-infectious encephalomyelitis\", ''encephalomyelitis\", ''encephalitis\", ''multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis\", ''vaccination\", ''immunisation\", ''influenza\", and ''post-influenza\". We then describe a patient presenting with bilateral optic neuropathies within 3 weeks of an influenza vaccination and delayed onset of ADEM 3 months post-vaccination.",

            "text": "Sejvar et al. reviewed the neurological adverse events associated with the smallpox vaccination in the USA between 2002 and 2004. They found 214 such occurrences with only 3 of these suspected of being ADEM, 12 giving an estimated rate of 5 cases per million vaccines. Reported rates vary from 1 in 4000 to 1 in 80,000 after primary vaccination, and from 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 450,000 after revaccination. 13 The reported incidence of ADEM following the Japanese encephalitis vaccination varies significantly depending on the population. 2, 14, 15 Between 1996 and 1998, the Japanese reported a rate of 0.2 per 100,000 as compared to a more frequent occurrence of 1 in 50,000 to 75,000 in Denmark. 15 Meanwhile there were no such events reported in the USA after administering more than 813,000 doses of Japanese encephalitis vaccine between 1993 and 1998. 15 In contrast, Menge et al. quoted an incidence rate as high as 1 in 600. 2 The association between the influenza vaccination and ADEM has only come to light in the recent years, and hence there have been no large population studies and no estimated incidence rates. A 14-year-old female developed ADEM 2 weeks after an influenza vaccination, 16 while 2 adult males, aged 62 and 70, were diagnosed with ADEM and transverse myelitis with acute motor axonal neuropathy respectively within 1 week of vaccination. 17 In a review of adverse events associated with intranasal influenza vaccine between 2003 and 2005 in the USA, 10 neurological events were reported of the total 460 adverse events, 18 which included 2 people with Guillain-Barre syndrome, 1 with Bell's palsy, one ADEM, one febrile convulsion, and 3 non-serious reports of dystonic tongue, tongue paraesthesia and ataxia/vertigo. Nakayama and Onoda found 3 cases of ADEM and nine of Guillain-Barre among 38.02 million doses of influenza vaccine administered between 1994 and 2004 by the Kitasato Institute, Japan. 19 Giant cell arteritis has also been associated recently with the influenza vaccination. 15 All the influenza vaccines available in Australia are either split virion or subunit vaccines prepared from purified inactivated influenza virus cultivated in embryonated hens' eggs. The safety and efficacy of split virion and subunit vaccines are generally considered to be equivalent. 20 Initially, post-vaccination ADEM was thought to be caused by the vaccine's viral component but it was later recognised that it could also be related to contamination with CNS tissue in which the vaccine was propagated. 1, 2 For example, the anti-rabies vaccine had been cultured from rabbit, sheep or goat brain, and the Japanese enceph-alitis vaccine from murine brain. 2, 21 This theory has been highlighted by a significant drop in post-vaccination ADEM incidence rates after the development of vaccines based on recombinant proteins rather than from in-vivo infected tissue. 1,2 Results from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) also support this concept. In EAE, a disease that clinically and pathologically resembles ADEM, inflammation is produced when an experimental animal is inoculated with myelin or myelin antigens. 1 High-affinity antibodies directed against myelin-basic protein (MBP) have been identified in ADEM patients vaccinated with Semple strain rabies, but not MS patients. 2 However, this does not explain the origin and cause of post-vaccination ADEM due to smallpox and several other vaccines that are prepared without the involvement of neural tissues. 1 The most common vaccinations associated with ADEM are the non-neural measles, mumps and rubella vaccines. The incidence of 1-2 per million for live measles vaccine is less than the reported 1 in 1000 incidence of post-infectious ADEM following infection with the measles virus itself. 1 Arguably, with both the virus and the vaccine as causes, vaccination dramatically reduces the incidence of ADEM.",

Diplopia and asymmetrical deficits mainly resemble MS. b) The number, morphology and distribution of lesions on MRI, with lesions >1 cm or involving the cortical ribbon or thalamus, or located infratentorially, and the later disappearance of T2 abnormalities, being distinctive of ADEM. The subsequent development of new lesions on MRI is quite typical of MS. c) Marked cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and a normal IgG index are typical for ADEM and would be highly unusual in MS. d) Bilateral prolonged visual evoked potentials (VEPs) with no history of optic neuritis occurs commonly in MS, but rarely in ADEM.",

Molecular mimicry Antigenic epitopes, comprising of delicate structural or partial amino-acid sequence homologies, are shared between an inoculated pathogen or vaccine, and a host CNS protein. 2 As a result, the pathogen is not recognised as ''foreign\" for elimination, nor ''self\" for immune tolerance. At the inoculation site the pathogen is initially processed by T cell activation and cross activation of antigen-specific B cells. These autoreactive cells can enter the CNS during immune surveillance and by chance, may encounter the homologous myelin protein. The local reactivation by antigen presenting cells subsequently culminates in a destructive autoimmune process in the CNS. 2 Much research has focused on T cell mediated autoimmune response to myelin autoantigens, such as MBP, proteolipid protein and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, which can induce ADEM. 23 Some studies have suggested a role for B cells and antibodies to gangliosides such as GM1 and GD1a, while others have identified T helper 2 cells reactive to MBP, which were found in the peripheral blood of ADEM patients. 23 ",

No pathognomonic clinical features are seen in ADEM, but a combination of altered consciousness or behaviour and multifocal neurological deficits especially if closely timed to an infection or immunisation, should alert the clinician to its possible diagnosis. 2 Certain series show that spinal cord dysfunction is more prevalent in adults than in children. 27 Seizures are seen more in post-infectious disease but are also associated with vaccination. 28 Encephalopathy, fever, seizures, and meningism are very rare in MS, which is one of the most important differential diagnoses. 1, 29 Focal presentation in ADEM is rather heterogeneous and depends upon the location and the degree of demyelination within the CNS. Multifocal presentations may be combinations of pyramidal and cerebellar signs, which are common, as are cranial neuropathies, which include bilateral optic neuropathies (more common in ADEM than in MS). 1 About 25% of patients present with a paraparesis or quadriparesis with urinary dysfunction when myelitis is predominant. Interestingly, in these cases the peripheral nervous system is also involved more frequently in the post-infectious form 30 but it has also been reported after vaccination, especially following rabies vaccination, with radicular complaints being the most frequent manifestation. 1 ",

Newer studies, however, shown that lesions in ADEM may evolve over several weeks and consequently only some lesions may be enhanced, or there may also be no enhancement. 29 Follow-up MRI scans after a minimum interval of 6 months is recommended to establish or confirm the diagnosis of ADEM at which time there should be a resolution, partial or complete, of old lesions and no new lesions. 1, 2 The appearance of new lesions is strongly suggestive of MS.",

Fundoscopy revealed pallor of both optic discs, more so on the right (Fig. 1) . The remainder of his neurological and general medical examination was otherwise unremarkable.",

The patient was diagnosed with ADEM and treated with high dose intravenous steroids consisting of 1g methylprednisolone daily for 5 days followed by oral tapering steroids. His orientation and alertness returned to normal within 2 weeks. On follow-up review 2 months later, he had fully recovered apart from visual acuity of 6/12 bilaterally and bilateral optic disc pallor. A repeat MRI of the brain was significantly improved.
