Purity of the cultures was 97-100%, as determined by endocytosis of latex beads, non-specific staining through Fc receptors, EA and EAC rosette formation. These cells were non-specific esterase-positive, but peroxidase-negative. Electronmicroscope observations revealed morphological similarities to mature macrophages. Isolated macrophage-microglia seldom incorporated [3Hlthymidine in vitro. By means of 51Cr release assay, using monoclonal antibodies against mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and complement, we detected class I MHC (H-2) antigen on unstimulated macrophage-microglia, and both class I and class II (Ia) antigens on ~,-interferon-treated cells. These observations suggest possible immunoregulatory functions of macrophage-microglia in the central nervous system, as is characteristic of other cells of monocyte lineage.",

Recently, we have shown that a neurotropic coronavirus (MHV-A59) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) induces class I antigen, but not class II antigen, on mouse oligodendrocytes and astrocytes (Suzumura et al. 1986b) . Another strain of murine neurotropic coronavirus (MHV-JHM) reportedly induces class II antigen expression of 10-20% of rat astrocytes (Massa et al. 1986 ). Inductions of MHC antigen expression on neural cells, which do not normally express detectable MHC antigens on their surface, suggest the possibility that the CNS cells can interact with or be a target of immunocytes in certain pathological conditions.",

Macrophage-microglia represent another type of cell in the CNS that may have immunoregulatory functions. The origin of macrophage-microglia in the CNS is still controversial. However, evidence suggests their origin from the monocyte (Imamoto et al. 1973; Ling 1981; Polak et al. 1982) . Most cells of monocyte lineage, such as Kupffer cells, Langerhans' cells and the alveolar macrophage, express class II antigens and play a key role in initiation or regulation of local immunological events, functioning as antigen-presenting cells or accessory cells (reviewed in Shevach 1985) .",

Small, round and phase-bright cells which appeared to be oligodendrocyte/precursor cells (Suzumura et al. 1984) began to grow on the top layer at 5-7 days in vitro (DIV) (Fig. 1A) . They were then shaken off at 10 DIV to obtain oligodendrocyte-enriched cultures. The flasks containing undetached flat cell layers (Fig. 1B) were re-fed with culture medium and cultured in the same manner. One or 2 days after first shaking, irregular phase-bright cells, which were a little larger than oligodendrocyte/precursor cells, appeared on the top layer. These cells became apparent over the entire surface ( Fig. 1C ) in 2-4 days. Cultures were then shaken on an orbital shaker as for isolation of oligodendrocytes, but at 150-200 rpm rather than 300 rpm. Supernatant media containing detached cells were filtered with 20 /~m nylon mesh and were placed in an uncoated Petri dish. They were incubated in 5% CO2-95% air atmosphere at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min to allow cells to attach to a dish. Medium containing unattached cells was removed and each dish was washed twice with culture medium to further eliminate unattached cells. The adherent cells were collected with a rubber policeman, and were plated on a poly-L-lysine-coated coverslip at a density of 1 \u00d7 105/12 mm diameter coverslip. Non-adherent cells were again washed off and re-fed with culture medium 1 h after plating.",

Cultures were then incubated with 30 /~Ci/ml of 51Cr (New England Nuclear, spec. act. 200-900 Ci/g chromium) for 2 h. Optimal conditions for this assay were determined as described elsewhere (Suzumura et al. 1986c) . In contrast to isolated oligodendrocytes (Suzumura et al. 1986c ), macrophage-microglia on coverslips incorporated ~Cr very well, and were resistant to high concentrations of ~lCr (10-200 #Ci/ml for 1-4 h). Since adequate counts for a cytotoxicity assay (10 516 _+ 613 cpm/coverslip, n = 10) could be obtained at the concentration of 30 /~Ci/ml for 2 h, this protocol was employed for this study. After rinsing in MEM 4 times, each coverslip was placed in a well of a 24-well culture plate (Falcon 3047). 50/~1 of either anti-MHC antibody or controls was layered on each coverslip with 10% fresh guinea pig serum as a source of complement.

Therefore, the results shown above mainly reflect 5tCr release from macrophage-microglia. Giulian et al. (1985) have recently isolated phagocytes from normal rat brain by a similar method, and called them 'ameboid microglia'. However, since neither the origin of microglia nor the relations between macrophages and microglia are clear, we suggest referring to these phagocytic cells in the CNS as macrophage-microglia at this time. Peripheral blood macrophages do not usually survive long in vitro because of their intrinsically short life span and inability to replicate in vitro (Herscowitz and Cole 1981) . By counting red blood cells in initially prepared primary mixed brain cell culture (Dubois et al. 1985a) , the roughly estimated contamination of peripheral blood monocyte-macrophages in our study was less than 50/flask and less than 0.5/coverslip. We observed a similar growth pattern of macrophage-microglia in cultures plated on either flasks or glass coverslips. Therefore, it is unlikely that the cells we isolated are blood macrophage contaminated at the preparation of initial cultures.",

Electron microscopic findings were indistinguishable from those of mature macrophages. We did not find proliferation in our experimental conditions, as determined by [3H]thymidine autoradiography. Dubois et al. (1985a) have also reported that phagocytes in primary dissociated brain cell cultures seldom incorporated [3H]thymidine.

Sodium azide did not completely inhibit either ingestion of latex beads or endocytosis of fluorescein-labeled reagents. Pretreatment with FCCP (0.2 mM) for 20 min successfully inhibited ingestion of latex beads without obvious morphological changes.
