The single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome is approximately 27 kb, with eight subgenomic mRNAs (sg-mRNAs) that are transcribed under the regulation of transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs). The leader TRS is located at the 5'-end of the viral genomic RNA and 8 body TRSs are located upstream of the coding regions of structural and nonstructural genes. The homology between the leader and body TRSs may affect the copy number of Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00705-016-3208-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. subgenomic mRNA transcripts and the level of gene expression [4, 44] . The viral genome encodes RNA polymerase/transcriptase (1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural proteins (nsps), 3a, 3b, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b and 6b, and nucleocapsid (N) [7, 35] . Large 1a and 1ab proteins are cleaved by viral proteases into approximately 15 nsps, which are involved in virus replication and pathogenicity [2, 13] . Spike is cleaved into S1 and S2 by proteases, and most epitopes for virus neutralization are within the hypervariable regions of S1 and S2 [19, 20] . Six epitopes, D (24-60), E (132-149), C/A/B (291-398) and F (497-543), in S1 and 1 epitope, G (548-574), in S2 have already been defined [19] . Different IBV serotypes do not confer protective effects against each other. E and M proteins are important for virion assembly and are membrane-anchored glycoproteins [9] . The short ectodomain of the M protein protrudes out from the viral envelope and contains a protective epitope [14] . Viral variation and diversity are attributed to the long RNA genome and frequent nucleotide substitutions, deletions, insertions, and recombination events occur due to the poor proofreading capability of RNA polymerases [16, 27, 31, 43] .",

            "text": "IBVs are distributed worldwide in poultry, and most countries have their own indigenous variants and common genotypes [38] . According to a phylogenetic analysis based on the short variable region of S1, several indigenous and common IBV genotypes (e.g., K-I, KM91-like, New cluster 1, QX-like) have co-circulated, and in the past recombination events are suspected to have occurred in Korea [16, 24, 25] . Nephropathogenic KM91-like viruses were first isolated in 1991 and became prevalent in the field. To prevent the economic losses caused by KM91-like virus infection, oil emulsion-inactivated and attenuated live vaccines have been used in Korea [25] . QX-like IBVs are rampant throughout Asia and Europe. They were initially isolated in 1997 in China and might have been introduced to Korea in 2002-2003 [1, 8, 18, 24, 25] . Subsequently, novel recombinant viruses (New Cluster 1, NC1), which were suspected to have originated through recombination between KM91-like and QX-like viruses, emerged in Korea in 2005 and became prevalent between 2007 and 2010 [27] . Recent recurrences of QX-like viruses were observed in 2008 and 2011, and they have become prevalent in Korea [31] . Phylogenetic and computational recombination analyses using genome sequence data have shed light on the occurrence of complex recombination events in the genomes of IBVs and the precise donor and acceptor relationships between concurrent field viruses during recombination [6, 11, 15, 16, 35, 42] . However, the minimum essential core replication and pathogenicity-related 1ab gene is not typically included in phylogenetic analyses. In the present study, we analyzed coding and non-coding IBV sequences and conducted computational recombination analyses as well as phylogenetic analyses with S1, 1ab, and full genome sequences of two early, three recombinant and two recurrent QX-like viruses to understand the molecular epidemiology and molecular evolution of QX-like viruses at the genome level. Consequently, we clarified the molecular epidemiology of infectious bronchitis caused by QX-like viruses in Korea. Furthermore, we classified IBVs into three distinct lineages, including North America-Europe, China/Taiwan, and China, by using a 1ab gene-based phylogenetic analysis. We found that the early Korean and European QX-like viruses were generated by recombination between the North America-Europe and China lineages.",

Based on the clustering patterns, we classified IBVs into North America-Europe, China/Taiwan, and China lineages.

CK/SWE/0658946/10 clustered with the French strain LGD/120723 clustered with viruses from the China lineage but did not form a cluster with QXlike viruses in the S1 tree.

The absence of pure QX-like viruses before the appearance of the early QX-like viruses suggests that recombinant viruses were introduced from other countries. A computational recombination analysis did not support recombination events in the S2, 3a, 3b, 4b, and 4c genes of the early QX-like viruses. However, their low nucleotide and amino acid identities, to both KM91 and YX10, and relatively high identities to other viruses in the North America group suggest potential recombinant events with other unknown viruses. The NC1 viruses may be products of recombination between the early QX-like and KM91-like viruses, as previously reported [27] . Furthermore, the low nucleotide and amino acid identities of the recurrent QX-like virus 5b and N genes to both KM91 and YX10, but high identities to other viruses in China also suggest frequent recombinant events in the 5b and N genes. A high number of recombination breakpoints were identified in the 1a region, but the probabilities for these hotspots were not significant [39] . However, recombinant events among IBVs may occur more frequently in the latter fourth of the viral genome than the remainder of the genome containing the 1ab gene [22] . Thus, phylogenetic analyses based on 1ab may provide more information on the evolution of IBVs. According to the results of the present study, IBVs were classified into the North America-Europe, China/Taiwan, and China genotypes. The clustering of KM91, the early QX-like viruses, and the NC1 viruses with the viruses of the North America-Europe lineage was unexpected, but recent reports on the spread of H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses from Korea to North America and Europe as well as their reintroduction to Korea by migratory birds may provide a hint [21, 23] . Siberia and Beringia are breeding sites for migratory birds from Eurasia and parts of North America, China, Korea and Japan are wintering sites [23] . The high prevalence and diversity of gamma coronaviruses in Beringia wild birds may contribute to the intercontinental spread and evolution of these viruses [32] . The presence of the European QX-like viruses ITA/ 90254/2005 and CK/SWE/0658946/10 in a cluster with the early QX-like viruses in the S1 gene tree may also reflect recurrent recombination events between viruses of the North America-Europe and China lineages. The recent detection of IBV-like gene fragments in the wild bird population may support a possible role for wild birds as reservoirs or long distance carriers [12, 17] . However, it is not clear whether they play a role in the recombination events of IBV. In addition, it is not clear why the QX-like viruses provide the spike gene rather than the 1ab gene.",

The 1ab gene encodes nsps 2-16, which are essential for viral RNA replication and pathogenicity [2, 13, 29] . Thus, 1ab genotypes that increase replication may be selected for in the competitive conditions of superinfected cells. The early QX-like viruses possessed the 1ab genes of KM91-like rather than QX-like viruses. The predominance of KM91-like 1ab genes supports the hypothesis that they conferred more favorable biological properties to the recombinants than the QX-like 1ab genes. For example, they may have conferred efficient virus replication and extended persistence in the trachea [34] . Based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities, nsp 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were more variable than the other nsps among the viruses (Table 4 ). Nsp 2 is a papainlike viral protease and nsp5 is a coronavirus endopeptidase. They are important for the post-translational cleavage of nsps [13] . Nsp 3, 4, and 6 possess transmembrane domains and form an internal membrane scaffolding complex that facilitates the assembly of the membrane-associated replication complex [33, 37] . The interactions between these molecules and their role in complex formation may facilitate the coevolution of nsp 3, 4, and 6. The deubiquitinating activity of nsp 3 and its frequent mutations during the attenuation of virulent strains as well as the autophagosome-generating activity of nsp 6 may be directly, or indirectly, related to viral competence. This in turn may influence how recombinant viruses overcome host responses and promote their own growth [3, 10, 34] .",

The 1-2 mismatches in the sg-mRNA 3 (encoding the E protein) and lack of mismatch in the sg-mRNA 5 (encoding the 5a and 5b proteins) of the early QX-like and the NC1 viruses, except SNU9106, are also consistent with 3 and 2 mismatches, respectively, in the corresponding sg-mRNAs of recurrent QX-like viruses. Differences in the expression of the E, 5a, and 5b proteins may affect virus replication efficiency [36] . Thus, these mismatches c Fig. 2 Phylogenetic trees based on: 1.5 kb nucleotide sequences of S1 (a), full genome (b), and 1ab genes (c), were constructed with the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 5.05. The bootstrap values were determined from 1000 replicates of the original data. The branch number represents the percentage of times that the branch appeared in the tree. Bootstrap values greater than 90% are shown. The p-distance is indicated by the bar at the bottom of the figure. The QX-like viruses characterized in the present study are marked with closed circles (b) between the leader and the body TRSs may be related to the predominance of certain genomic backgrounds. Furthermore, the higher copy number of the 1(S) sg-mRNA in recurrent QX-like viruses than KM91-like viruses may increase the probability of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase mediated spike gene recombination [22] . Therefore, further studies to investigate these mechanisms may be valuable in the future. The proteolytic cleavages of the spike protein are essential for virus infection of host cells. The cleavage site between S1 and S2 contained the furin-recognition motif R-X-R(K)-R, and was shared by all of the compared viruses [5] . The second proteolytic cleavage site near the fusion peptide of the spike protein is important for virus entry, syncytium formation and virus infectivity [41] . The second cleavage sites of all the compared viruses contained only 1 to 3 arginines, and they may be cleaved by other serine proteases [41] . The effects of the single amino acid insertions in the ER motif of E and ectodomain of M proteins are unknown. However, the differing amino acid sequences of the M protein ectodomains, identified when examining recurrent QX-like viruses, encourages further study of a role for IBV antigenic variation [14] .",

However, the prevalence of the recurrent QX-like viruses and their epitope structures may reflect incomplete protective effects or vaccine breaks when conventional vaccines are applied in the field.",

The predominance of KM91-like 1ab and QX-like spike genes in the recombinant viruses suggests that these loci are beneficial with respect to replication efficiency and the capacity to evade immunity, respectively.",
