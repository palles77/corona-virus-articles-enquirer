APOL1-associated nephropathy typically occurs in association with certain environmental factors or systemic diseases. As such, there has been increasing evidence of the role of interferon (IFN) pathways in the pathogenesis of APOL1-associated collapsing glomerulopathy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and systemic lupus erythematosus, 2 conditions that are associated with high IFN levels. Collapsing glomerulopathy has also been described in patients receiving exogenous IFN therapy administered for various medical conditions. We describe a patient with a genetic condition that results in an increased IFN state, stimulator of IFN genes (STING)-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), who developed collapsing glomerulopathy during a flare of his disease. The patient was found to have APOL1 G1 and G2 risk variants. This case supports the role of IFN in inducing APOL1-associated collapsing glomerulopathy.",

[3] [4] [5] APOL1 risk variants have incomplete penetrance, such that most patients carrying a high-risk genotype never develop meaningful kidney disease. 5, 6 This observation, along with the frequent identification of environmental factors and systemic diseases in patients with APOL1associated disease, has suggested the possibility of a \"2-hit\" scenario. 7 Commonly associated factors include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 5 systemic lupus erythematosus, 4, 8 and membranous glomerulopathy. 9 Additionally, APOL1-associated nephropathy has been described in patients undergoing interferon (IFN) treatment, and IFN-induced increase in podocyte expression of APOL1 has been shown in vitro. 10, 11 Stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) is a type I interferonopathy syndrome first described in 2014. 12 STING is a critical protein in type 1 IFN response to viral doublestranded DNA. In SAVI, gain-of-function mutations in TMEM173, the gene encoding STING, cause its activation, boosting synthesis of type 1 IFN. 12 Type I IFN then triggers a positive feedback loop leading to activation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT 1) and 2 (STAT 2), and transcription of proinflammatory IFN-stimulated genes. 12 Clinically, SAVI is characterized by neonatal-onset systemic inflammation, severe cutaneous vasculopathy, and interstitial lung disease. [12] [13] [14] Kidney involvement associated with SAVI has not been previously described.",

IFNs are molecules secreted in response to pathogens, and their production results in an inflammatory state. As such, patients with type 1 interferonopathies who are affected by the upregulation of type I IFN signaling have persistent systemic inflammation. There is a growing body of evidence implicating IFN pathways in the pathogenesis of APOL1-associated collapsing glomerulopathy. Collapsing glomerulopathy is the most fulminant histopathologic form of APOL1-associated nephropathy. This form of glomerulopathy is well known to be associated with diseases that have increased IFN levels, such as HIV infection and systemic lupus erythematosus. 4, 5, 9, 15 Additionally, exogenous IFN therapy, administered for various medical conditions, has been shown to be associated with collapsing glomerulopathy in a case series of 11 patients. 10 Among these patients, all 7 tested were homozygous for APOL1 risk variants. 11 Regardless of the associated conditions, kidney biopsies from patients with APOL1associated nephropathy frequently show solidified and disappearing-type glomerulosclerosis, thyroidization type of tubular atrophy, and microcystic tubular dilation. 3 Some of these features are evident in the case under discussion.",

This is pertinent because overexpression of APOL1 has been shown to be injurious to cells both in cell culture and an animal model. 11, 16, 17 Notably, overexpression of APOL1 risk variants is more injurious to cells than overexpression of the wild-type protein. Together, these studies demonstrate an association between increased IFN levels and APOL1-associated nephropathy. 4 It is worth noting that although the presented case highlights the potential of IFN to cause podocyte injury, the severity of foot-process effacement in the examined glomeruli was discrete. Studies of patients with collapsing glomerulopathy in various clinical settings have shown significant variability in the degree of foot-process effacement, with 15% to 62% of patients having absence of severe effacement by electron microscopy. 18, 19 We report a case of APOL1-associated nephropathy in the setting of the genetic disease SAVI, a type I interferonopathy syndrome, which raises the possibility of increased risk for kidney disease in African American patients with this disease. In addition, this case further establishes the pathogenic role of IFN in patients with 2 APOL1 risk alleles. Similar to patients with exogenous IFN therapy, this patient with a condition that leads to increased endogenous IFN levels developed the most fulminant form of APOL1-associated nephropathy, collapsing glomerulopathy.",
