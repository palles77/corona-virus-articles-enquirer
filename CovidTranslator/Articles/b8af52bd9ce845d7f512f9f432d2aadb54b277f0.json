Using a viral metagenomics approach, we analyzed the virome of feces from wild and captive red-crowned cranes, which were pooled separately. Vertebrate viruses belonging to the families Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Circoviridae, and Caliciviridae were detected. Among the members of the family Picornaviridae, we found three that appear to represent new genera. Six nearly complete genomes from members of the family Parvoviridae were also obtained, including four new members of the proposed genus \"Chapparvovirus\", and two members of the genus Aveparvovirus. Six small circular DNA genomes were also characterized. One nearly complete genome showing a low level of sequence identity to caliciviruses was also characterized. Numerous viruses believed to infect insects, plants, and crustaceans were also identified, which were probably derived from the diet of red-crowned cranes. This study increases our understanding of the enteric virome of red-crowned cranes and provides a baseline for comparison to those of other birds or following disease outbreaks.",

In the spring and summer, migratory populations of red-crowned cranes breed in Siberia (eastern Russia), northeastern China, and occasionally in northeastern Mongolia. In the fall, they migrate in flocks to Korea and east-central China to spend the winter. They are omnivores that feed on small fish, worms, insects, frogs, and plants.",

In order to avoid contamination, fresh samples were collected carefully by a specialized breeder able to distinguish the feces of red-crowned cranes from those of other birds. Fecal samples were resuspended individually in ten volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and vigorously vortexed for 5 min.

The information for each library is shown in Supplementary Table S1 . For bioinformatics analysis, paired-end reads of 250 bp generated by MiSeq were debarcoded using vendor software from Illumina. An in-house analysis pipeline running on a 32-node Linux cluster was used to process the data.

            "text": "The family Picornaviridae currently consists of 94 species grouped into 40 genera. In this study, a picornavirus was found in the feces of wild red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis), and tentatively named \"gapovirus\" (Grus japonensis virus). We successfully amplified the complete genome of gapovirus, which included a 571-bp 5' UTR, a 6696-bp polyprotein ORF and a 163-bp 3' UTR. Like other picornaviruses, the polyprotein of gapovirus could theoretically be cleaved into VP1-4, 2A-2C, and 3A-3D (Fig. 2d) . The hypothetical cleavage map of the gapovirus polyprotein was derived from a comparison with other known viruses in the genus Hepatovirus. The P1 polypeptide (793 aa) belongs to the rhv-like superfamily and shares 39.8% amino acid sequence identity to that of bat hepatovirus (GenBank no. KT452729), the highest similarity among members in the genus Hepatovirus. The P1 was assumed to be cleaved at VP4/VP2 ( 36 I/ 37 T), VP2/VP3 ( 260 T/ 261 M) and VP3/VP1 ( 512 Q/ 513 A). The P2 polypeptide of 642 aa contains nonstructural proteins and is speculated to be cleaved at 2A/2B ( 1004 D/ 1005 V) and 2B/2C ( 1108 Q/ 1109 S). BLASTp showed that the P2 region had 37% amino acid sequence identity to that of bat hepatovirus (GenBank no. KT452729), Similar to members in the genus Hepatovirus, the P3 polypeptide contains proteins 3A, 3B, 3C pro (protease) and 3D pol (RNAdependent RNA polymerase). The P3 is 796 aa in length and is speculated to be cleaved at 3A/3B ( 1499 A/ 1500 K), 3B/3C ( 1527 Q/ 1528 S) and 3C/3D ( 1746 G/ 1747 R). A BLASTp analysis showed that the P3 polyprotein of gapovirus shared 43% amino acid sequence identity with the rodent virus Tupaia hepatovirus A (GenBank no. NC_028981), the highest similarity among members in the genus Hepatovirus. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on the P2 and P3 regions of gapovirus and representative strains of 35 genera of the family Picornaviridae. The result indicated that gapovirus was not closely related to members of any previously recognized or proposed genera ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S1 ), and it formed a separate branch distinguishing it from members of the genera Hepatovirus and Tremovirus (Fig. 2b) . The P1 region of gapovirus shares 39.8% amino acid sequence identity to bat hepatovirus, but members of the genus Hepatovirus share over 70% sequence identity with one another (Fig. 2c) . According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (http://www.picor nastu dygro up.com/ defin ition s/genus _defin ition .htm), the members of a picornavirus genus should share > 40%, > 40%, and > 50% amino acid sequence identity in their P1, P2, and P3 region, respectively. Our data indicate that gapovirus qualifies as a member of a novel genus in the family Picornaviridae.",

A nearly complete genome sequence of 7073 bp was determined, including a 591-bp 5' URT, the complete P1 and P2 regions, and part of the P3 region. The hypothetical cleavage map of the grusavirus polyprotein was derived from alignments with other known viruses of the genus Hepatovirus. The P1 region of grusavirus is assumed to be cleaved at VP4/VP2 ( 22 Q/ 23 D), VP2/VP3 ( 242 N/ 243 A) and VP3/VP1 ( 495 Q/ 496 G). The P1 polypeptide is 772 aa in length, belongs to the rhv-like superfamily, and has the best BLASTp match to phopivirus in genus Hepatovirus (GenBank no. NC_027818). The latter was identified in a seal, sharing 43% amino acid sequence identity in P1 to grusavirus. The P2 region of grusavirus is 636 aa in length and contains nonstructural proteins with cleavage at 2A/2B (E 973 /T 974 ), and 2B/2C (S 1081 /I 1082 ). BLASTp analysis showed that the P2 region had 32% amino acid sequence identity to Tupaia hepatovirus A (GenBank no. NC_028981), the highest similarity among members of the genus Hepatovirus. The partial P3 region is 752 aa in length, including complete 3A, 3B, 3C, and partial 3D, and is assumed to be cleaved at 3A/3B (F 1463 /K 1464 ), 3B/3C (H 1489 /R 1490 ), and 3C/3D ( H1707 /R 1708 ). The partial P3 region shared 41% amino acid sequence identity with phopivirus (GenBank no. NC_027818), the highest among members of the genus Hepatovirus. The gapovirus and grusavirus amino acid sequence are 34%, 30%, and 36% identical in P1, P2 and P3, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on P1 and P3 showed that grusavirus belongs to a different clade from the members of the genus Hepatovirus, and therefore represents a new genus in the family Picornaviridae ( Fig. 2a and 2b) .",

Three complete genome sequences and one nearly complete genome sequence were then determined using RT-PCR to bridge gaps between contigs, followed by direct Sanger sequencing, and were tentatively named GrHAV. The polyproteins of those four GrHAVs were 2214 aa, 2125 aa, 2377 aa, and 2178 aa, respectively (Fig. 3a) . Hypothetical maps of those four GrHAV polyproteins were derived by comparison with the polyproteins of DHAV strains ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table S3 ), although some cleavage sites within the region of VP1 to 2A2 were uncertain because of high variation among GrHAVs and DHAVs. The similarity between the four GrHAVs and DHAVs in pairwise comparison of the VP1-2A2 regions ranged from 16% to 25% (Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The length of the VP1-2A1 region of the four GrHAVs varied in length, (476 aa, 501 aa, 608 aa and 630 aa). Phylogenetic analysis based on the P1 region showed that these four GrHAVs clustered separately from their closest relatives in the genera Avisivirus and Avihepatovirus (Fig. 3b) . Pairwise sequence similarity comparison of the P1 regions of these four GrHAVs and the representative strains of the genus Avisivirus and Avihepatovirus showed that the four GrHAVs shared 32.4%-35.9% amino acid sequence identity with different strains of the genus Avihepatovirus and 29.9%-32% amino acid sequence identity with the representative strain of the genus Avisivirus (Fig. 3c) . Based on the phylogenetic analysis of P1 region and genetic distance calculations, the four GrHAVs should be assigned to a novel genus in the family Picornaviridae.",

The nearly complete genomes of GAPV1-4 were 4305 bp, 4354 bp, 4274 bp, and 4534 bp in length, respectively, all of which included two ORFs encoded one nonstructural protein (NS) and one structural protein (VP). The length of the NS protein is 663 aa for GAPV1, 660 aa for GAPV2, 657 aa for GAPV3, and 662 aa for GAPV4. The conserved motif \"GPSNTGKS\" associated with ATPase is present in NS1. The VP protein of the different GAPVs is variable in length. The shortest VP is in GAPV3 (483 aa), followed by GAPV1 (514 aa), GAPV4 (529 aa), and GAPV2 (537 aa), all of which are much shorter than those of the other members of the subfamily Parvovirinae (approximately 700 aa on average). The conserved phospholipase A 2 (PLA2) motif that is often present in members of other genera was absent in the VP protein of GAPVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the NS1 amino acid sequences showed that GAPV1-4 clustered with TP1 from a turkey (GenBank no. KF925531) and HK_2014 from a chicken (GenBank no. KM254174) (Fig. 4c) , forming an avian chapparvovirus clade. Pairwise comparison of NS1 proteins of GAPV1-4 revealed 41.7-44.3% amino acid sequence identity with that of TP1. The NS1 amino acid identity among the four GAPVs is 40.9%-45.2%. According to ICTV guidelines, parvoviruses sharing > 85% amino acid sequence identity in the NS1 protein belong to the same species.

These viruses were named RCPV1 (redcrowned crane parvovirus) and RCPV2, respectively. The genomes of RCPV1 and RCPV2 were 5,515 bp and 5,456 bp in length, and both contain three ORFs (Fig. 5a) . The left ORF encoded a non-structural protein (NS) and was 680 aa in length in both RCPVs.

Both RCPVs had a middle ORF encoding a 161-aa protein. Pairwise comparison showed that the two RCPVs shared 99.3% amino acid sequence similarity in the NS1 protein and 82% based in VP1 protein. RCPVs shared the highest NS1 amino acid sequence similarity (58% identity) with NS1 of chicken parvovirus ABU-P1 (GenBank no. GU214704), which was detected in a fecal sample [19] .

Two complete genome sequences of gemycircularvirus, named Grus japonensis associated gemycircularvirus (GaGmCV) were assembled from two libraries, one of which was from wild red-crowned cranes and the other one was from breeding red-crowned cranes. The genomes of the two GaGmCVs were 2,138 bp and 2,277 bp in length, respectively. Genome analysis indicated that GaGmCVs have two main ORFs that separately encode CP and Rep protein that are 297 aa and 309 aa in length, respectively, when including a putative intron (Fig. 6b and c) . The conserved PCR motifs I, II, and III were present in Rep, where PCR motif I was identified as L(F/L)TYSQ, PCR motif II was TH(L/Y)H(C/A), and PCR motif III was YA(I/T)K. The conserved motifs of the superfamily 3 helicases were not obvious through alignment with sequences of other gemycircularviruses. The nonanucleotide sequences of GaGmCVs were atypical, including only eight nucleotides in this motif, \"GGA CGA AA\" and \"GAA ACT TA\", respectively (Fig. 6h) . BLASTp analysis based on the Rep of GaGmCVs showed that GaGmCV1 shared the highest amino acid sequence similarity (48% identity) with Pacific flying fox feces associated gemycircularvirus 11 (GenBank no. KT732807), and GaGmCV2 shared the highest amino acid sequence similarity (69% identity) with dragonfly-associated circular virus 3 (GenBank no. NC_023870). Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence of Rep protein showed that GaG-mCVs were located on two separate branches, with GaG-mCV2 clustering with dragonfly-associated circular virus 3 (GenBank no. NC_023870), while GaGmCV1 clustered with FaGmV-4 (GenBank no. KF371638) identified in fur seal [25] (Fig. 6a) .",

The genus circovirus comprises 29 species, members of which have been identified in birds, dogs, minks, pigs, bats and fish [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Circoviruses were originally isolated from various birds. Some Circovirus strains have been associated with a variety of diseases in birds and pigs, including respiratory and enteric disease, dermatitis, and reproductive problems [33, 34] . Here, four genome sequences were assembled from sequences present in red-crowned crane feces. They were temporarily named GaCV1-4. The complete genome sizes were 1,852 bp for GaCV1, 2,288 bp for GaCV2, 1,686 bp for GaCV3, and 1830 bp for GaCV4, all of which encoded two major proteins: CP and Rep (Fig. 6d-g) . A BLASTp search based on the Rep proteins indicated that GaCV1-4 shared the highest amino acid similarity of 41%, 41%, 56%, and 45%, respectively, with their most closely related viruses. Phylogenetic analysis over the amino acid sequence of Rep protein confirmed that those four novel circo-like viruses did not belong to the genus Gemycircularvirus or Circovirus (Fig. 6a) . GaCV1 and GaCV2 clustered with the Lake Sarah-associated circular virus 1 isolate LSaCV-1-LSCO-2013 (Gen-Bank no. NC_029607), forming a separate branch.

Although some countries have strengthened protective measures, the number of red-crowned cranes continues to decrease. Viral metagenomics can be used to characterize viral nucleic acids enriched from a variety of sources without cell culture amplification and has been used in numerous animal virus discoveries [31, 40, 41] . We describe here the fecal virome of red-crowned cranes from three different sources. The fecal virome of red-crowned cranes included a large numbers of vertebrate, plant, insect, and aquatic animal viruses. Plant, aquatic and insect viral sequences may reflect the omnivorous diet of red-crowned cranes. Vertebrate viral sequences predominated in the total number of reads but varied from 45.2 to 97.7% of total viral reads among different groups of animals. Parvoviridae reads dominated in wild and breeding groups, while the largest percentage of viral reads in the ornamental group were from members of the family Picornaviridae. This difference may be due to the susceptibility or exposure of the different groups and/ or simply the stochastic nature of infections in these groups.",
