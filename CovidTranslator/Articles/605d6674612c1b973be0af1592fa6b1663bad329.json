            "text": "The prevalence of respiratory viruses in immunocompromised adult patients and the association with clinical outcomes is still underexplored. Our goal was to assess the epidemiology and the potential clinical impact of respiratory viral infections in a highrisk patient population. Two large hospitals performed a respiratory Taqman array card (TAC), targeting 24 viruses, 8 bacteria, and 2 fungi simultaneously, on 435 samples from 397 symptomatic immunocompromised patients. Clinical details were collected retrospectively using a structured case report form. An overall positivity rate of 68% was found (51% mono-and 17% co-infections). Pathogen distribution was as follows: influenza A (20.7%), rhinoviruses (15.2%), coronaviruses (7.8%), Pneumocystis jirovecii (7.4%), RSV (7.1%), and CMV (6.0%) were the most frequently encountered, followed by HSV (5.5%), hMPV (4.4%), parainfluenza viruses (3.9%), influenza B (3.7%), and Aspergillus species (3.7%). Other pathogens were not detected or detected only in \u2264 1% of samples. Hospital and ICU admission rates were 84% and 11%, respectively. The presence of a pathogen was strongly associated with higher need for supplemental oxygen (p = 0.001), but it had no impact on ICU admission, mechanical ventilation requirement, antibacterial therapy, or mortality. In conclusion, our study described the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens in a large group of symptomatic immunocompromised patients and provides evidence of a relationship between pathogen detection and the need for supplemental oxygen. This association was still found after the exclusion of the results positive for influenza viruses, suggesting that non-influenza viruses contribute to severe respiratory illness in patients with compromised immunity.",

In addition to respiratory viruses, the impact of so-called atypical bacteria, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila and fungi such as Pneumocystis jirovecii and Aspergillus species, in immunocompromised hosts also needs to be established in large studies.",

The length of stay was not always restricted to respiratory episode but was in some cases much longer due to for example other co-morbidities, chemotherapy cures, other infectious syndromes, or even long delay for transfer to rehabilitation centers. The administration of antibiotics and/ or antivirals was very often started empirically for treatment of the respiratory infection, but some patients were also on prophylactic drugs. Patients on antiviral therapy were most frequently treated with oseltamivir (68%), then acyclovir (18%), (val)ganciclovir (10%), and ribavirin (3%). Overall, patients for whom a respiratory pathogen was found were significantly more likely to require supplemental oxygen (40.6% vs 23.9% (p = 0.001)) and to be treated with antivirals (41.9% vs 10.3% (p < 0.001)), but there was no impact on ICU admission, mechanical ventilation requirement, antibacterial therapy, or mortality.

The proportion of flu infections in immunocompromised patients described in the literature varies due to the variable nature of the influenza virus itself and its ability to The so-called \"common cold\" viruses (rhinovirus and coronavirus) were frequently encountered. This reflects the epidemiology of the adult population living in the community and is in line with findings described in the literature [9] [10] [11] [12] . In addition to the low prevalence of \"atypical\" bacterial pathogens, which might be explained by the exclusion of samples taken \u2265 14 days after the onset of symptoms, viruses such as bocavirus, adenovirus, and enterovirus were very infrequent in this adult population (< 1%). This study showed a relatively high incidence of opportunistic pathogens in BAL samples. The HSV positivity rate might be underestimated since this target was not present on the TAC used at the St-Jan Brugge-Oostende Hospital. The median Ct value was 29 for P. jirovecii, indicating a significant pathogen load. Nearly all patients with a positive result for P. jirovecii in BAL were treated with high-dose cotrimoxazole during at least 21 days. Some data exist on the epidemiology and impact of opportunistic pathogens such as P. jirovecii [13] [14] [15] , CMV [16, 17] , HSV [18] [19] [20] , and Aspergillus species [21] in immunocompromised patients. Quantitative assays or working with (arbitrary) cut-off Ct values seems critical to determine clinical relevance, although every positive result in a BAL sample could be of clinical importance, especially in this group of patients. Ct values above ct28 for Aspergillus species or Pneumocystis may point to a very early phase of reactivation but on the other hand they may correspond to colonization (or contamination).",

The observed differences might be explained by differences in type and level of immunosuppression. Interestingly, influenza A virus and coronaviruses were more common in hematologic oncology patients than in the SOT patients. These rates might have been biased due to the shorter inclusion period in St-Jan Hospital covering the influenza epidemics (but not the RSV peak), where most of these hematology patients were included. Since the two hospitals had a different inclusion profile and since they are geographically separated, this might also have biased the differences in pathogen prevalence between patient groups. However, the two centers are only 95 km from each other, and the climate is similar in both regions.",

Other studies also revealed a significant association between a positive respiratory virus PCR and the presence of an acute respiratory disease [8, [22] [23] [24] . In our study however, the association with antiviral therapy may be confounded since the treating clinicians were not blinded to results. At the Erasme Hospital, TAC analysis was performed retrospectively, but the clinicians were aware of conventional viral testing results (based on direct fluorescent antibody testing and viral culture) [3] . At the St-Jan Hospital, clinicians received the results of TAC analysis within 24 h after sampling.",
