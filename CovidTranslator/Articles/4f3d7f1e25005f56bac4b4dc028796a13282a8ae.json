We have developed an improved method for Epstein-Barr virus transformation of human B cells.

One such antibody confers protection in vivo in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection. These results show that it is possible to interrogate the memory repertoire of immune donors to rapidly and efficiently isolate neutralizing antibodies that have been selected in the course of natural infection.",

The practice of administering polyclonal immunoglobulins from hyperimmune sera of animal or human origin, introduced by Behring and Kitasato 1 , has been used extensively in prophylactic as well as therapeutic settings 2 .

However, these methods have very low efficiency and therefore alternative strategies have been developed. These include (i) humanization of murine monoclonal antibodies through protein engineering 9 , (ii) selection of antibodies from phage-display libraries of human antibody fragments 10 and (iii) immunization of transgenic mice carrying human immunoglobulin loci, followed by production of monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology 11 . Although these methods have led to the development of several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against cytokines or surface molecules, their impact on infectious disease therapy has been less pronounced 12 . Indeed, the number of therapeutic antibodies against infectious agents is still limited and only one is currently in use, to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in newborns 13 .",

We found that the addition of CpG 2006 increases the efficiency of B cell immortalization from 1-2% to 30-100%. Replicate cultures containing 10 IgG + memory B cells were set up and culture supernatants were analyzed for the presence of specific antibodies after 2 weeks ( Table 1 ). The fraction of cultures producing antibodies detected by ELISA was very high at 2 months after infection (virtually every second culture scored positive, consistent with a precursor frequency of~1 in 20) and decreased by 6 and 8 months. The frequency of cultures producing antibodies staining spike-transfected cells could be measured only at the 4, 6 and 8 months time points and was lower but more sustained. Most supernatants that stained spike-transfected cells showed neutralizing activity, but overall there was poor correlation between staining and neutralization (see Supplementary Fig. 1) .

Consequently, the memory B cell pool can be interrogated at any time after priming, with the only limiting factor being the total number of cells that need to be screened to access enough specificities. As an example, we have been able to isolate neutralizing monoclonal antibodies specific for measles virus from a blood sample obtained 47 years after infection (E.T., unpublished data).",

            "text": "The high efficiency of EBV immortalization and cloning obtained in the presence of a polyclonal activator were instrumental in the isolation of several monoclonal antibodies specific for SARS-CoV. Most of the monoclonal antibodies we isolated using ELISA recognized NP or other viral proteins, but did not neutralize the virus. Indeed, the fraction of memory B cells that recognized denatured viral proteins exceeded by 5-to 10-fold the fraction of B cells that recognized the native spike protein. Furthermore, only 50% of the antibodies that stained spike-transfected cells showed neutralizing activity, possibly because they recognized epitopes that are not available on the spike trimers. These findings indicate that most of the human B cell response is directed against nonprotective epitopes. Initial screening for neutralizing antibodies led to the isolation of the S3.1 clone, the only clone tested in an animal model. The subsequent development of a spike-binding assay allowed much more rapid identification of neutralizing candidates and led to the isolation of antibodies with neutralizing capacity up to 300-fold higher. When neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were compared for spike staining and neutralizing activity, two patterns emerged (Fig. 2) . Some antibodies showed high-avidity binding to spike transfectants and a neutralizing titer proportional to the degree of binding. In contrast, other antibodies showed low-avidity binding in spite of efficient viral neutralization. It is possible that the former recognize exposed epitopes within the receptor binding S1 domain of the spike protein, whereas the latter recognize epitopes within the S2 domain, which is exposed only during viral fusion and may be poorly accessible in transfected cells 25 . An alternative possibility is that spike molecules may be differentially assembled in viral particles compared to BHK cells. This may explain the lack of correlation between staining and neutralization, as well as the finding that most antibodies neutralized virus at concentrations at which staining was hardly detectable. Further studies, including assessment of direct binding to viral particles, analysis of escape mutants 25 and epitope mapping using synthetic peptides, will be required to elucidate how antibodies to the spike protein neutralize SARS-CoV infection.",

This method offers two unique features: First, the antibodies are produced by immortalization of memory B lymphocytes, which are stable over a lifetime and can easily be isolated from peripheral blood. This bypasses the need for antigen boosting required for the generation of hybridomas. Second, the antibody is isolated from a primed natural host who has survived the natural infection, eliminating the need for immunization of experimental animals, which may show different susceptibility and, therefore, different immune responses. This method delivers large numbers of antibodies that can immediately be selected for the most favorable profile according to criteria such as affinity, epitope specificity and propensity to generate escape mutants.",

A drop of the suspension was deposited on formvar carbon-coated nickel grids for 1 min. The excess fluid was blotted away and the grids were floated on a drop of PBS containing 1% BSA for 10 min. Bound antibodies were detected with a donkey anti-human IgG antibody coupled to 6-nm gold particles (Dianova). The samples were negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid and examined in a Zeiss 109 electron microscope.In vivo neutralization assay. The SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) was kindly provided by L.J. Anderson and T.G. Ksiazek (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia). A virus stock of 10 6.5 TCID 50 per ml was generated. All work with infectious virus was performed inside a biosafety cabinet in a biosafety containment level 3 facility and personnel wore powered air purifying respirators (3M HEPA AirMate). The mouse studies were approved by the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee and were carried out in an approved animal biosafety level 3 facility. All personnel entering the facility wore powered air purifying respirators. Four-to six-week-old female BALB/c mice (Taconic) were housed four mice per cage. On day 0, mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and received intraperitoneal injections of the S3.1 antibody in one of three doses (800, 200, 50 \u00b5g) or a control monoclonal antibody lacking neutralizing activity. Mice were challenged with 10 4 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV intranasally 24 h later, and were killed after an additional 2 d. The lungs and turbinates were removed and homogenized in a 5% w/v suspension in Leibovitz 15 medium (Invitrogen) and virus titer was determined in Vero cell monolayers.Note: Supplementary information is available on the Nature Medicine website.",
