A stomach tube should be passed to decompress the rumen. If no free gas is coming out of the tube, it might be a frothy bloat or intestinal volvulus. Abnormal findings at rectal palpation are presence of fresh blood, absence of feces, tension band, distended small bowel, distended cecum, or a mass among small bowels. Ileus and peracute enteritis can be easily confused with jejunal obstruction. Usually, the small bowel will be distended primarily with fluids and easily palpable per rectum. Tension bands may also be palpated. In volvulus, intestines are severely distended with gas occupying the pelvic cavity. Intussusception is difficult to identify precisely but usually is suspected if a hard mass is felt among distended small bowels. Jejunal hemorrhage syndrome (JHS) might have a similar rectal examination finding except that the rectum is filled with ripe raspberry-like feces in variable quantity. Animals with enteritis may have a fever and show other clinical signs or laboratory results compatible with it (ie, leukopenia). Finally, the heart rate is a good indicator of the severity of the condition but should be correlated with other findings. A cow with mildly distended small bowel and a heart rate of 80 beats per minute (bpm) does not need immediate assistance. However, a cow with a distended organ and heart rate of 100 bpm and dehydrated needs immediate assistance.",

Sternal recumbency is an option but the animal must be secured to prevent it from standing during the surgery (Fig. 2) . Doing the surgery on a secured recumbent animal has the main advantage of doing the manipulation without worrying if the animal lies down, kicks, or moves constantly while suturing the intestines.

Broad spectrum antibiotics must be given before the surgery and repeated during the procedure if it lasts longer than 2 hours. Regional block or paravertebral block is preferred, allowing the surgeon to extend the incision at his or her convenience.

This short mesentery precludes adequate exteriorization of some segments of the small bowel. Only the portion to be resected should be exteriorized to avoid excessive traction and contamination during the resectionanastomosis (Fig. 3) . Infiltration of 2% lidocaine into the mesentery where resection is planned may decrease the pain of traction. The mesenteric vessels (arteries and veins) are ligated using mass ligation with absorbable suture material (United States Pharmacopeia [USP] 3 chromic gut, USP 1 polyglactin 910), being sure not to compromise the blood supply to the intestine to be preserved. Mass ligation is required because cattle do not have a well-defined arcuate vascular anatomy (as do horses) and the fatty mesentery renders vessel identification impossible. 4 The sutures are placed in an overlapping pattern such that double ligation of the vessels is accomplished (Fig. 4A ). This technique may be performed rapidly. However, it is impossible to effectively ligate all the vessels. It will be completed on complete resection of the intestinal segment. Stapling instrumentation is highly unreliable for occlusion of mesenteric vessels because of the large amount of fat normally found in the intestinal mesentery of cattle. Ligasure (Covidien, Medtronics, Minneapolis, MN, USA) is an electrocautery device that will seal vessels through a specially designed forceps. It seals vessels up to 7 mm in diameter. It is efficient and safe but expensive to use. Moreover, the machine is not meant to be used in a field situation.",

When exteriorization allows it, thirty centimeters of healthy bowel adjacent to the affected portion are also resected. The proximal segment of bowel is carefully exteriorized to its maximum length and the Doyen forceps are removed. Distended orad intestine can be decompressed through the enterectomy site with special care to avoid contamination of the incision or abdomen with ingesta. This procedure will lessen the severity of postoperative ileus and shorten convalescence. The 2 segments of intestine are reunited by end-to-end or side-to-side anastomosis with an absorbable suture material (USP 2-0 for adult, USP 3-0 to 4-0 for calves with polyglactin 910 or polydioxanone) using a single or 2-layer suture pattern. 5 A simple full-thickness, continuous suture provides better apposition and less lumen diameter reduction (Fig. 5) . The anastomosis is performed in 2 to 3 overlapping simple continuous suture lines, each placed in one-half of one-third of the circumference, so that a purse-string effect is not created. A 2-layer technique consists of a simple continuous suture involving the mucosa and submucosa, followed by a Cushing or Lembert pattern. The initial suture line should be placed at the mesenteric attachment because this is the most likely site for leakage to occur. Some surgeons prefer using a full-thickness, simple interrupted suture when segments to anastomose are of significantly different diameter (Fig. 6) . After the anastomosis, the mesentery is sutured in a continuous pattern with a USP 0 absorbable suture material (see Fig. 6 ). The affected intestine is thoroughly washed with sterile isotonic fluids, checked for the presence of leakage, and replaced into the abdomen.

Exteriorisation of the duodenum is limited to the cranial and descending duodenum. The duodenum can be affected in many ways, from simple ileus to perforation. 9, 10 Any intervention on the duodenum is difficult because only the oral part of the cranial duodenum and a portion of the descending duodenum can be exteriorized. Three types of obstruction are reported: functional, intraluminal or extraluminal, and strangulation. Phytobezoar or trichobezoar, and foreign bodies, were reported to cause intraluminal obstruction, whereas adhesions and liver abscesses may cause extraluminal obstruction. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Strangulation of the caudal flexure of the duodenum was reported in 3 cows during late pregnancy because the uterus had passed through a rent in the mesoduodenum. 16, 17 A duodenal obstruction caused by a malposition of the gallbladder was also reported. 18 ",

A simple enterotomy can be performed on the cranial and descending duodenum to remove a foreign body ( Fig. 7) or trichobezoar. However, any obstruction involving the sigmoid flexure of the duodenum is difficult because it cannot be exteriorized. A laterolateral bypass between the cranial and descending duodenum is the only alternative (Fig. 8) . 19, 20 Recently, a new condition was described as a volvulus of the sigmoid flexure of the duodenum. 19 The origin of the condition is unknown. A similar presentation was reported by van der Velden in the 1980s. 20 Asynchronous motility of the cranial duodenum was suspected. This is a surgical condition and diagnosis is confirmed during the laparotomy. Surgical findings are an enlarged abomasum and cranial duodenum. The sigmoid flexure is severely distended with gas and a volvulus can be palpated at its root, close to the neck of the gall bladder, on the visceral part of the liver (Fig. 9 ). The volvulus is reduced and cranial duodenal content is milked through the flexure to ensure that it is functional. If the viability of the sigmoid flexure is in doubt, a laterolateral duodenal bypass must be performed between the cranial duodenum and the descending duodenum. 19 The prognosis for any duodenal obstruction is generally good after cause and electrolytes imbalance are corrected.

After the initial signs of abdominal pain subside, affected cattle become progressively lethargic, recumbent, and show apparent depression. Abdominal distention becomes apparent after 24 to 48 hours duration. This is caused by gas and fluid distention of the forestomach and intestines, and sequestration of ingesta within the gastrointestinal tract results in progressive dehydration and electrolyte depletion. Heart rate will increase proportionally to abdominal pain, intestinal necrosis, and dehydration. Fecal production may be normal for up to 12 hours after the occurrence of the intussusception but minimal fecal production is noted after 24 hours duration.

In calves and small ruminants, percutaneous palpation and ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen may be used to identify intestinal distention and, possibly, the intussusception. 29, 38 Transabdominal and rectal ultrasound can also be used in adult cattle with the appropriate equipment.

The regimen can be adjusted postoperatively related to surgical findings. Intra-abdominal surgical manipulations are painful demand appropriate preoperative analgesia. NSAIDs are given preoperatively, along with butorphanol (0.05 mg/kg S.C.). Right paralumbar fossa exploratory laparotomy is the surgical approach of choice for treatment of intussusception. Most small intestines of cattle have a short mesentery, preventing adequate exteriorization of the intussusception through a ventral midline incision. Also, the attachments of the greater omentum limit exposure with this approach. Most often, diagnostic exploratory laparotomy is performed with the cow standing after regional anesthesia. Tension on the mesentery of the small intestine results in pain and cattle may attempt to lie down during the procedure. Of 35 cattle having standing, right paralumbar fossa laparotomy for resection of intussusception, 14% became recumbent and 26% attempted to become recumbent during the surgery. 21 Preoperative planning should include anticipation of this possibility. When intussusception is suspected and the animal is of high perceived economic value, right paralumbar fossa celiotomy may be performed with the patient under general anesthesia and in left lateral recumbency. The intussusception may be more difficult to elevate through the incision in recumbent cattle because the fluid-filled bowel gravitates away from the surgical site.

It is referred to as JHS, hemorrhagic bowel syndrome, intraluminalintramural hematoma, bloody gut, or hemorrhagic enteritis. [41] [42] [43] [44] In the search for the cause of this disease, much speculation has fallen on Clostridium perfringens type A. 41,42 C perfringens type A was suspected as a cause or contributing factor in this disease because this organism has been cultured from the intestinal contents or feces of a large number of cows affected with JHS. 42, [45] [46] [47] However, evidence regarding pathogenicity of these isolates has not been produced that links C perfringens type A to development of JHS. Moreover, C perfringens type A is also found in the gastrointestinal tract of cattle without causing clinically apparent disease. 48, 49 At present, it is thought that JHS is a multifactorial disease. 41, 42, 46 Proposed risk factors include feeding of silage or total mixed ration (TMR), feeding finely ground corn in the ration, early stage of lactation, high level of production, and free-choice feeding. These factors may create an environment in which stress, excess gastrointestinal starch, and subclinical rumen acidosis allow overgrowth of C perfringens type A bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. C perfringens type A produce a-toxin, and some may produce a beta2 toxin. 50, 51 In a retrospective study on 37 cattle, C perfringens type A was isolated of all the 20 samples (feces, blood clot, intestine). 47 A subsample of 10 was further analyzed for toxins in which a-toxin was isolated in all and beta2 toxin in 1 sample. 47 Excess grain or starch in the small intestine is more likely to lead to sudden bacterial overgrowth. 41, 42, 48, 49, 52 This passage of grain particles into the small intestine may be a factor in the pathogenesis of JHS in dairy cows fed high grain TMR. Excess mixing of TMR causing finely powdered corn was suspected to be related to an outbreak of clinical cases of JHS on 1 farm. 42 ",

The differential should include winter dysenteriae (coronavirus), intussusception, and abomasal ulcers. Transabdominal ultrasound examination of the intestinal tract is helpful to confirm the diagnosis but even more helpful to find an obstruction. Braun and colleagues 55 performed ultrasound on 63 cows with hemorrhagic bowel syndrome (HBS). Their findings included fluid and fibrin between jejunal loops, increased jejunal diameter (mean: 6.76 cm, n 5 2-4 cm) 1 with postobstruction empty loops, absence of motility, heterogeneous hyperechoic intraluminal material corresponding to blood clots, and abomasal distension. 55 Similar findings were reported by other investigators (Fig. 12) . 46, 47 Treatment Before any surgical intervention, the animal's hemodynamic status and electrolytes imbalance must be stabilized. Large-volume (20-40L) isotonic solution or blood transfusion (6-12L) can be administered before surgery. Hypokalemia is a common finding. Some of these animals are recumbent before or after the surgery with a S-shaped neck which is typical of the hypokalemic syndrome in cattle. It can certainly worsen the ileus. However, the surgery cannot be delayed because it may takes a few days to correct the hypokalemia.",

Although torsion of the abomasum and uterus are found in cattle, torsion of the small intestine is rare. Small intestinal volvulus may occur in different forms. [58] [59] [60] The most severe forms of intestinal volvulus originate from the root of the mesentery and involve the entirety of the small intestine and mesenteries (Fig. 16) . Volvulus of the root of the mesentery causes obstruction of venous outflow and arterial blood supply to the intestines. Ischemic necrosis of the intestine occurs rapidly, which causes metabolic acidosis, shock, and death. Volvulus of the jejunoileal flange refers to volvulus of the mid-to-distal jejunum and proximal ileum in which the mesentery is long (Fig. 17) . This long mesentery and associated bowel has been termed the flange and it may rotate about its mesentery without involving the remaining small intestine. Often, arterial occlusion is not found with volvulus of the jejunoileal flange, possibly because extensive fat Intestinal Surgery deposits within the mesentery may prevent compression of the muscular wall of the arteries until the volvulus becomes severe. However, obstruction of outflow of venous blood may be equally detrimental because of mural edema, shunting of blood away from the mucosa, and progressive ischemia.",

Hairballs (trichobezoar) are caused by frequent ingestion of hair. This is seen most commonly in cattle infested with lice or mange, or during the spring when shedding of the winter hair coat occurs. Phytobezoars and enteroliths form around undigested materials (eg, nylon fibers, cotton fabric). In a necropsy survey of 166 dead calves less than 90-days-old in Western Canada, 56 calves died because of perforation of an abomasal ulcer. 64 Calves having an abomasal ulcer were 2.74 times more likely to have an abomasal hairball. Calves less than 31 days old and having an abomasal ulcer were 3.81 times more likely to have an abomasal hairball. However, the investigators were unable to establish a causative relationship between the presence of abomasal hairballs and a perforating ulcer. During a study of confined cattle being fed a roughage-limited diet, cows began biting hair from each other's hair coats and developed multiple ruminal hairballs (2-10 hairballs weighing 0.2-3.8 kg each). 65 The investigators speculated that the cows began grazing hair because of the lack of roughage in the diet, boredom, and high stocking density. One report describes clinical findings in 2 sheep having 107 individual hairballs. 66 The investigators speculated that pruritus or some unknown dietary deficiency was the cause of excessive ingestion of the wool.",

Abomasal hairballs may cause pyloric obstruction, which leads to rapid onset of abdominal distention. The authors prefer to perform a right paramedian or ventral paracostal laparotomy to exteriorize the abomasum. An abomasotomy is performed along the greater curvature of the abomasum, the foreign bodies removed, and the abomasum is closed with absorbable synthetic suture material (eg, 0 polydioxanone, polyglycolic 910) using 2 layers of an inverting suture pattern. When obstruction of the duodenum, jejunum, or spiral colon is suspected, a right paralumbar fossa celiotomy and exploration of the abdomen should be performed. The foreign body is found by exteriorizing a segment of normal or distended intestine and tracing this segment oral or aboral, respectively, until the obstruction is found. This segment of intestine is exteriorized from the abdomen, isolated using moistened surgical towels, and an enterotomy performed (Fig. 18) . After removal of the foreign body, the enterotomy is closed with absorbable suture material (eg, 2-0 polydioxanone, polyglactin 910) using 2 lines of an inverting suture pattern. The enterotomy may be closed transversely to maximize the lumen of the affected segment of intestine and minimize the tension endured by the suture line during contraction of the intestinal wall. When the perceived economic value of the affected cow is high, surgery may be performed with the patient under general anesthesia. This will minimize the risk of ingesta contamination of the abdomen during surgery.",

The outcome is variable depending on the severity of the obstruction. It can be a simple ileus to a strangulated segment of intestines. There are many case reports in the literature showing the infinite possibilities of internal herniation, including incarceration of the jejunum in the epiploic foramen, 68 prolapse of the jejunum through a rectal tear, 69 jejunal incarceration in a partially everted urinary bladder, 70 strangulation of the jejunum by a persistent urachus, 71 or around a persistent round ligament of the liver. 72 Strangulation of the caudal sigmoid flexure of the duodenum was described in 2 latepregnant cows. The uterus was trapped through the mesoduodenum caudally causing an oral obstruction without significant vascular strangulation. 16 It was hypothesized that the mesoduodenal defect was developmental. Manual reduction was impossible. Transection and end-to-end anastomosis were successfully performed on both animals. 16 Gut tie is a jejunal incarceration around the ductus deferens in castrated steers. [73] [74] [75] It could be related to excessive manual traction on the testicle during castration creating a rent in the mesoductus and allowing jejunum to wrap around the ductus deferens causing strangulation. The clinical signs are similar to any intestinal obstruction. Abdominal palpation per rectum will show mucus or a small amount of feces, distended jejunum, and a small-diameter tight band crossing the caudal abdominal cavity toward the inguinal rings. Although manual rupture of this band per rectum has been reported, 75 surgery is often indicated to precisely cut the ductus and evaluate intestinal viability. Prognosis is generally good, depending on the viability of the affected portion of the jejunum.",
