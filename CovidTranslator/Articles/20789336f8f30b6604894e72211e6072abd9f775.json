The virus can cause severe respiratory tract infections in its host more often in the elderly, immunocompromised, or individuals with multiple medical comorbidities 3 . Current data suggests that while up to 80% of those infected are either asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms, 15% of those infected will have severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 5% will require intensive care and mechanical ventilation 2 . Typical symptoms include fever (88.7%), dry cough (67.8%), and fatigue, with symptoms such as sputum production, sore throat, headache, and GI symptoms occurring less commonly 2 .",

Based on the most up-to-date statistics, COVID-19 is considered highly virulent with an expected R 0 of at least 2.2 much higher than the R 0 of seasonal flu, which is typically closer to 1.3. 1 2 Correct Answer = E, Explanation: Patient typically present with lymphopenia and mildly elevated AST and ALT. Procalcitonin is normal. Patient who present with severe lymphopenia and elevated D-dimer has an associated increased risk of mortality. Chest Radiograph (AP view): Upper lung emphysematous changes. Nonspecific bibasal airspace disease which could represent atypical infection or pulmonary edema superimposed on chronic inflammatory changes. Stable mediastinal contour and heart size. No large effusion or pneumothorax.",
