            "text": "Mass gatherings at sporting events, 1,2 or religious pilgrimages, 3, 4 attract millions of international and national hostcountry travellers, who put themselves at risk of acquiring local endemic infectious diseases. [5] [6] [7] Over the past five decades, the public health authorities of the host country have focused their attention on the transmission of infectious diseases and their impact on the attendees at the mass gathering, the local population, and the local health system. The appearance and reemergence of several new lethal pathogens of humans with epidemic potential have heightened awareness of the potential of rapid spread at mass gathering events. 8 New zoonotic infectious diseases of humans include Nipah virus, hantaviruses, West Nile virus, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and avian viruses, among others. 7, 8 The unprecedented Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa 9 and the ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in South America 10, 11 were declared Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in August 2014 and February 2016, respectively. Yellow fever outbreaks in a number of African countries in 2015/2016 are cause for concern, with infections in unvaccinated travellers to Angola posing a risk on return to their countries of residence. 12, 13 There are a number of challenges for countries hosting major international sporting events during a PHEIC. 4, 14, 15 The 2013-2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa, which resulted in over 28 637 cases and 11 315 deaths, 16 required that countries holding these events put in place public health programmes for enhanced surveillance and specific response plans for any suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). Three major sports events were held in Africa during different phases of the Ebola virus outbreak, with participation by sportsmen and women and supporters from a broad range of African countries, including Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, the three most affected countries.",

The second African Youth Games were held in Gaborone, the capital city of Botswana, from May 22 to May 31, 2014; in retrospect, this was at a time when the Ebola virus outbreak had expanded rapidly within the affected region. This event took place at a number of venues in Gaborone and drew around 2000 athletes aged 15 to 20 years, who took part in a wide range of sporting events including football, swimming, fencing, boxing, cycling, and rugby, as well as their support teams; the participants came from 51 African countries including Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. Spectator attendance was mainly from Botswana and countries in the region. At the beginning of May 2014 the Ministry of Health of Botswana was on high alert and requested that the WHO provide rapid technical support in strengthening public health capacities under the framework of the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, in the context of the expanding Ebola virus outbreak. Botswana had never previously managed cases of suspected or confirmed VHF.",

Proof of yellow fever vaccination was required as a condition of entry for travellers from yellow fever endemic countries. At the international airport in Gaborone, port health staff screened incoming travellers for fever; they were supported by a small team of medical personnel trained for the event. A small medical facility was established at the airport for the isolation of patients. While a strong national surveillance system supported by district outbreak response teams was already in place for epidemic-prone diseases, this was supplemented by a daily surveillance system for specific priority conditions pertinent to the event. Both a syndromic approach and laboratory confirmation to identify participants with an acute febrile illness were used. A daily analysis attempted to establish trends. An emergency 24-h reporting system was established for persons with suspected meningitis or VHF, and for any outbreaks.",

Sourcing of adequate supplies of PPE was a challenge. Since Botswana did not have laboratory capacity for VHF and other specialized testing, arrangements were made for testing to be conducted in the biosafety level 4 (BSL4) laboratory and reference laboratories at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, approximately 4 h by road from Gaborone. The requisite export permits and transport arrangements were facilitated. The public health and hospital laboratories in Gaborone were able to test for malaria and meningitis and common pathogens.

[4] [5] [6] Even though the risk of introduction of a case of EVD would in reality be quite low, the high profile of these sporting events and the major negative effect of even one suspected or confirmed case on the games, necessitated special preparations over and above those needed to monitor and manage the more usual communicable disease risks associated with mass gatherings. Persons with early or acute EVD are less likely to travel and unlikely to take part in a sporting event. Exit screening was introduced after the declaration of EVD as a PHEIC, and transmission requires direct contact with blood and body fluids of infected persons. 18 However, EVD was spread to a number of countries through travel, 19 persons are asymptomatic during the incubation period, sexual transmission by survivors is now well documented, 20 and certain contact sports may pose a risk, albeit small, for transmission.",
