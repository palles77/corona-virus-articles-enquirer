            "text": "Making well-informed and effective capital investment decisions lies at the heart of any successful business organization. However, prior to investing in a project, an executive/manager should make three key estimates to ensure the viability of a business project: economic useful life of the asset, future cash flows that the project will generate, and the discount rate that properly accounts for the time value of the capital invested and compensates the investors for the risk they bear by investing in that project ( Olsen et al. , 1998 ) . Although the first two items are fairly challenging to estimate, the last one is even more challenging. In their book related to cost of capital, Ogier et al. (2004) provided an excellent example which I would like to use to provide a practical introduction to this chapter. I take the liberty to modify the story in accordance with the needs of this chapter. Imagine yourself at the edge of a river where your goal is to pass the river getting minimally wet in the least possible time. Before making your move you need to turn to a local inhabitant who knows which stepping stones are safe, what the velocity and the viscosity of the water are, what the turning moments are, and what the probability of loose stones on the stream bed is. This situation is similar to the world of today's business investments. That is, executives need to make informed decisions about their investments and find out the minimum acceptable rate of return their shareholders expect as a compensation for the risks investors undertake. In addition, when an investment consists of both debt and equity, then the executives need to estimate the total cost of capital employed in this project to be able to pay their debt holders. This chapter intends to serve as a field guide or handbook of the cost of capital estimation for hospitality executives and practitioners. However, before getting into the practical aspects of cost of capital, some relevant concepts will be discussed from a theoretical perspective to better understand the background of this important topic.",

            "text": "Prior to getting into the core of the subject of estimating cost of capital, it is useful to define what risk is and describe the role it plays in investment decisions. In the hospitality field, risk is often defined as the variation in returns (probable outcomes) over the life of an investment project ( Choi, 1999 ; Olsen et al. , 1998 ) . The concept of risk is at the foundation of every firm as it seeks to compete in its business environment. Financial theory states that shareholders face two types of risk: systematic and unsystematic. The examples of systematic risk could be changes in monetary and fiscal policies, the cost of energy, tax laws, and the demographics of the marketplace. Finance scholars refer to the variability of a firm's stock returns that moves in unison with these macroeconomic influences as systematic, or stockholder, risk ( Lubatkin and Chatterjee, 1994 ) . Stated differently, the level of a firm's systematic risk is determined by the degree of uncertainty associated with general economic forces and the responsiveness, or sensitivity, of a firm's returns to those forces ( Helfat and Teece, 1987 ) . In other words, these types of risk are external to the company and are outside of its control. However, a loss of a major customer as a result of its bankruptcy represents one source of unsystematic, or firmspecific risk (idiosyncratic or stakeholder risk). Other sources of unsystematic risk include the death of a high-ranking executive, a fire at a production facility, and the sudden obsolescence of a critical product technology ( Lubatkin and Chatterjee, 1994 ) . Unsystematic risk is a type of risk that can be eliminated by an individual investor by investing his/her funds in multiple companies ' stocks. The same rule may not be applied by company executives, since the success of a single project determines their tenure within their firms.",

Markowitz pioneered the application of decision theory to investments by contending that portfolio optimization is characterized by a trade-off of the reward (expected return) of that individual security against portfolio risk. Since the key aspect to that theory is the notion that a security's risk is the contribution to portfolio risk, rather than its own risk, it presumes that the only risks that matter to investors are those that are systematically associated with market-wide variance in returns ( Lubatkin and Schulze, 2003 ; Rosenberg, 1981) . Investors, it argues, should only be concerned about the impact that an alternative investment might have on the risk-return properties of their portfolio. However, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) ( Lintner, 1965 ; Sharpe, 1964 ) (to be discussed in detail later) does not explicitly explain what criteria investors should use to select",

            "text": "In contrast, the field of strategic management is based on the premise that to gain competitive advantage, firms must make strategic, or hard-to-reverse, investments in competitive methods (portfolios of products and services) that create value for their shareholders, employees, and customers in ways that rivals will have difficulty imitating ( Olsen et al ., 1998 ) . These investments enable the firms to protect their earnings from competitive pressure, and allow firms to increase the level of their future cash flow, while simultaneously reducing the uncertainty associated with them. The management of firmspecific risk lies at the heart of strategic management theories ( Bettis, 1983 ; Lubatkin and Schulze, 2003 ) , and, from this perspective, management must work hard at avoiding investments that create additional levels of risk for the firm. Bettis (1983) further affirms that the CAPM's emphasis on the equilibration of returns across firms (i.e., systematic risk) relegates to a secondary role strategy's central concern with managerial actions that seek to delay the calibration of returns (i.e., unsystematic risks). Thus, the claim that systematic risk is paramount to the firm is undermined by the two arguable assumptions from portfolio theory: stockholders are fully diversified, and the capital markets operate without such imperfections as transaction costs and taxes. Some stockholders, however, are not fully diversified, particularly the corporate managers, who have heavily invested, both financially and personally, in a single company ( Vancil, 1987 ) . Also, transaction costs, such as brokerage fees, act as a minor impediment, inhibiting other stockholders from completely eliminating unsystematic risk ( Constantinides, 1986 ) . Finally, taxes make all stockholders somewhat concerned with unsystematic risk (Amit and Wernerfelt, 1990; Hayn, 1989 ) because interest on debt financing is tax deductible, thereby allowing firms to pass a portion of the cost of capital from their stockholders to the government. Thus, firms can create value for their stockholders, within limits, by financing investments with debt rather than equity (Kaplan, 1989; Smith, 1990) . The limits are determined in part by the amount a firm is allowed to borrow and the terms of such debt, both of which are contingent upon the unsystematic variation in the firm's income streams. Lubatkin and Chatterjee (1994) contend that the debt markets favour firms with low unsystematic risk because they are less likely to default on their loans (this is particularly the case of the hospitality industry firms). In summary, the discussion of partially diversified stockholders, transaction costs, and leverage suggests that some stockholders may be concerned with unsystematic risk and factor it along with market risk to determine the value of a firm's stock (Amit and Wernerfelt, 1990; Aron, 1988 ; Lubatkin and Schulze, 2003 ; Marshall et al. , 1984 ) .",

The cost of debt is relatively simpler to calculate when a hypothetical firm issues bonds that are rated by the major bond-rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's. Thus, these ratings may be used as a guide in computing the cost of debt. In addition, an investor may use the bond's yield to maturity or the rate of return that is in congruence with the rating of a bond. Averaging the interest rates of long-term obligations of a firm is another method to calculate the cost of debt.

Thus, since there is no contractual agreement between the shareholders and the firm, the expected rate of return on invested equity is extremely challenging to estimate.

This is due to the fact that common stockholders are the residual owners of all earnings not reserved for other obligations, and dividends paid are usually only a portion of the earnings accruing to common shares. The other major difficulty in applying this model lies in determining the specific dividend growth rate, which is based on future performance tempered by past experience.

Chatterjee et al. (1999) claim that herein lie two dilemmas: first, decreasing \u03b2 requires managers to reduce investors ' exposure to macroeconomic uncertainties at a cost lower than what investors could transact on their own by diversifying their own portfolio; and second, to downplay the importance of firm-specific risk that not only is contrary to the strategic management field but also tempts corporate bankruptcy ( Bettis, 1983 ) . Therefore, an executive of a given company has to take into account the total risk of the project because, unlike investors holding stocks of multiple companies, the executive may not be able to diversify the risk of his/her company's investment by investing in multiple projects.",

Sheel (1995) was the first researcher in the hospitality industry to point out that CAPM does not seem to meet the industry needs and called for further research into industry-specific factors. In the mainstream financial economics, Downe (2000) argued that in a world of increasing returns, risk cannot be considered a function of only systematic factors, and thus \u03b2 . He pointed out that the position of the firm in the industry, as well as the nature of the industry itself become a risk factor. Thus, firms with a dominant position in the industry that succeed to adapt to the complexities of the business environment, will have a different risk profile than their competitors. This argument is particularly well fitting in the context of the hospitality industry where companies such as McDonald's and Marriott may demonstrate a different risk profile based on their market share in their segments.",

While Jagannathan and Wang's study (1996) added a human capital variable to their cost of equity capital model, it measured human capital effects from the macroeconomic perspective as opposed to a micro level where most hotel firms operate.

This implies that it is not yet known how firm fundamentals such as profitability or growth produce common variation in returns associated with size and BE/ME factors and this variation is not captured by the market return itself. These authors further query whether specific fundamentals can be identified as state variables (variables that describe variation in the investment opportunity set) and these variables are independent of the market and carry a different premium than general market risk.

As Fama and French (1997) pointed out, the cost of equity estimates yielded by these models are distressingly imprecise. Standard errors of more than 3% per year were typical when the CAPM and FF models were used to estimate industry costs of equity in their study ( Fama and French, 1997 ) . They stated that large standard errors are driven primarily by uncertainty about true factor risk premiums. Since the hospitality industry is really the aggregate of individual units that all have their own unique business environments and return on equity structures, this means that the standard errors, and thus, cost of equity capital on a per-company, single-unit (a hotel property or a restaurant) basis, or for a new project will be even more imprecise. Therefore, the risk determinants of cost of equity and risk factor loadings for individual operating units will be even more difficult to estimate. Thus, it is very important to consider the purpose for which the cost of equity is estimated (e.g., a single project, business division, or an entire corporation). Particularly, in the case of single project cost of equity estimations there might be several factors that need to be considered before arriving at the proper discount rate of the project. These factors might be location of the project, local/regional competition, political risk, credit risk, and other risk idiosyncratic to a given project. Consequently, as Ogier et al. (2004) suggest when estimating a cost of equity for a given project the risk of the project will be much more important than the risk level of the corporation making the investment. In other words, when Marriott Corporation makes a capital investment decision in Nairobi, Kenya, the Marriott Corporation executives will be much more concerned with the risks surrounding that project.",

            "text": "Unlike cost of equity, cost of debt does not require the use of sophisticated theoretical models. Rather, cost of debt is simply the rate at which a given company can borrow capital from a lender (e.g., bank) or the rate at which the aforementioned company can issue bonds. Some experts caution that the \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 promised and the expected yields of debt are two different concepts. In other words, when a firm makes contracted debt payments on time it meets \" the promised yield \" to its lender. However, in reality, there is always a possibility for default and thus the difference between the promised yield and the probability for default equals the expected yield. The expected yield can be regarded as true cost of debt since it is more realistic. Although many textbooks calculate the cost of debt as promised yield, it should be noted that expected yield is more meaningful since it includes not only the systematic risk of the market but also the firm-specific risk of a given firm. Another challenge for calculating the cost of debt might occur when a firm uses multiple debt instruments (e.g., bank loans, commercial papers, bonds). In this case, it may be fruitful to average the rate of these instruments based on their weight in the debt portfolio. However, an easier and more simplistic approach would be to use the \" generic long-term debt \" rate which can be calculated from the current rate of a company's bond or current rate at which the company can borrow a longterm loan ( Ogier et al ., 2004 ) . Last, to estimate the cost of debt, the issue of tax shield should be given a close consideration. For instance, although the majority of the finance textbooks use 35 or 40% as an average for corporate tax rate in the United States, it is common occurrence to observe companies whose effective corporate tax rate is often lower than the statutory rate. Here, an executive should assess the situation and decide whether the effective tax rate trend is expected to continue to be below the statutory corporate tax rate in the long term. If that is the case, then he/she should use the effective tax rate in calculating the cost of debt. However, if a low effective tax rate is a short-term occurrence, then a given firm should use the statutory corporate tax rate instead ( Ogier et al ., 2004 ) .",

Caroll and Sikich (1999) argued that keeping track of at least a 3-year history of labour costs would serve to identify the dollar value of \" premium \" labour-related costs, which could be thought of as all labour/benefit costs above federally mandated minimum wage. Other techniques proposed by the authors were (1) to design a scoring system that illustrates productivity versus both baseline and premium labour/benefit costs by departments, and (2) to establish metrics to determine a productivity level for guest experience standards, facilities standards, and targeted revenue improvements on a department-by-department basis. Bloxham (2003) advocated adjustments to certain human resource expenditures to capitalize them over the time of the investment. In that approach, one-time human resources costs are amortized and capitalized in the value creation equation in an effort to demonstrate that human capital investments go beyond being a cost item in the firms ' operations. These costs can include recruiting, interviewing, and hiring costs; one-time hiring bonuses and relocation expenses; and training costs. The costs are capitalized and amortized over the average employee tenure with the company. In this case, if employee turnover is high, these costs would be amortized over a shorter time period (thus the costs will be higher), whereas the longer tenure of the workforce will enable the firm to spread the costs over a longer period of time. Kalafut and Low (2001) reported that in a study of the airline industry conducted by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young's Center for Business Innovation (CBI), the employee category was the single greatest value driver that had an impact on the firm's market value. The employee factor had a positive correlation of 0.68 with the firm value. Thus, Kalafut and Low (2001) conclude that in the aggregate, quality and the talent of the workforce, quality of labour management relations, and diversity are critically important in the value creation process of the airline companies.",

A brand is the product or service of a particular supplier which is differentiated by its name and perceived expectations on the part of the consumer. Brands are important and valuable because they provide a \" certainty \" as to future cash flows ( Murphy, 1990 ) . However, since the task of estimating brand value is yet an improbable one, its value is not specifically reflected on the company's balance sheet. Yet, the lodging industry has made much of the importance of the value of the brand but has not been able to unequivocally substantiate the role of the brand in reducing the variance in firm cash flows, and thus contributing to lower cost of capital for the firm. Srivastava et al. (1998) provided an analytical example of how successful market-based assets (the term authors use in lieu of intangibles) lower costs by building superior relationships with customers, enable firms to attain price premiums, and generate competitive barriers (via customer loyalty and switching costs). All these factors lead to the conclusion that a strong brand reduces the uncertainty pertaining to the future cash flows which in turn decreases the required return by the investors for the risk they bear by investing in a particular firm.",

Brand performance was measured by overall satisfaction with the product or service, return intent, price-value perception, and brand preference, while brand awareness was measured as top-of-mind brand recall. Olsen (1996) proposed brand-related value drivers specific to the lodging industry such as brand dilution and brand sincerity ratio. Brand dilution is related to the question of how many new corporate sub-brands must be introduced in order to maintain growth, whereas, brand duration deals with what percentage of hotels in the portfolio currently meet the brand standards or promise. As a result, it is argued that hospitality companies that possess higher-brand strength will be able to achieve a lower cost of equity capital.",

As a result, the hotel industry is perceived to be lagging behind the rival industries in the use of technology ( Sangster, 2001 ) . In part, this is attributed to the fragmented nature of the hotel business itself; however, it is also believed to be closely related to hoteliers ' lack of experience and understanding in technology investments ( Sangster, 2001 ) . Connolly further argued that \" Today's financial models are inadequate for estimating the financial benefits for most of the technology projects under consideration. While the hospitality industry has disciplined models and sufficient history to determine the financial gains or success of opening a new property in a given city, it lacks the same rigorous models and historical data for technology, especially since each technology projects are unique. Although this problem is not specific to the hospitality industry, it is particularly problematic since the industry tends to be technologically conservative and unwilling to adopt new technology applications based on the promises of their long-term merits especially if it cannot quantify the results and calculate a defined payback period. When uncertainty surrounds the investment, when the timing of the cash flows is unpredictable, and when the investment is perceived as risky, owners and investors will most likely channel their investment capital to projects with more certain returns and minimal risk. Thus, under this thinking, technology will always take a back seat to other organizational priorities and initiatives. Efforts must be made to change this thinking and to develop financial models that can accurately predict and capture the financial benefits derived from technology ( Connolly, 1999; p. iii) . \"",

In order to fill this void, academics and practitioners developed adjustment models to account for differences in cost of equity among markets in developing and emerging countries. The adjustment models are primarily concerned with whether the emerging markets are segmented or integrated with the world markets. That is, in a completely segmented market, assets will be priced based on local market return. The local expected return is a product of the local \u03b2 times and the local market risk premium (MRP) ( Bekaert and Harvey, 2002 ) . Bekaert and Harvey (2002) developed a modified model after researching 18 emerging markets for the pre-1990 and post-1990 periods and reported that the correlation of the emerging markets with the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) World Index increased noticeably. For instance, Turkey is one of the countries whose market correlation with MSCI World Index increased from less than 0.10 to more than 0.35. Based on this, Turkey may be considered an integrated capital market where the expected return is determined by the \u03b2 with respect to the world market portfolio multiplied by the world risk premium. This is the core argument of the Bekaert-Harvey Mixture model ( Bekaert and Harvey, 2002 ) .",

You can either use the industry average for cost of equity or locate two or three comparable firms that compete in the same line of business and estimate their cost of equity. However, even if you are an executive of a large restaurant corporation that is traded publicly, it is still recommended that you estimate the cost of equity for the entire restaurant industry because the standard error of regression coefficients for a single firm is fairly high, which decreases the reliability of these coefficients. My past research experience has showed me that at times using a single firm may create a situation in which cost of equity cannot be even estimated. More often than not, I obtained distressing results when running a regression for small-or medium-size hospitality firms. As a result, in the practical example, I will estimate the restaurant industry's cost of equity. Since the cost of equity calculation process may be a fairly complex process for someone who is not familiar with data analysis, I will offer a step-by-step procedure, which should better clarify this process:",

The issue of selecting the best index of all traded assets in the world is a very challenging and sometimes a controversial issue. Based on seminal \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 studies in financial management, the market index that yields most reliable results in the United States is Center of Research in Security Prices Value Weight (CRSPVW) Index housed at the University of Chicago. Both your company's stock and market return should be used as excess return (i.e., return less risk-free rate which is 1-month TB rate) in order to measure the cost of equity in real units (i.e., after accounting for inflation). For reasons mentioned before, I will be estimating the U.S. restaurant industry's cost of equity and leave the decision to restaurant industry executives to adjust this value to their specific projects at hand. In order to be able to observe the accuracy of cost of equity models, we estimate the restaurant industry cost of equity by using the CAPM and FF model. The observation period of this example is between 2000 and 2004. The reason for not selecting a longer observation period is that the values of \u03b2 and other variables become unstable over extended periods. The sample is developed from the Nation's Restaurant News (NRN) Index, which entails 81 restaurant firms. In cases when executives are not familiar with building stock portfolios, they can alternatively use monthly returns of hospitality indices for lodging and restaurant industries from data providers such as Yahoo! Finance, Wall Street Journal, or industry publications such as NRN.",

The monthly returns for FF factors (SMB and HML) can be retrieved from Eventus Database housed in the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania or from Kenneth French's website at Dartmouth College. By regressing monthly SMB and HML returns on market returns you can obtain \" s \" and \" h \" coefficients that can later be inserted into the equation to estimate the cost of equity. In our practical example, the results indicate that the FF model explains more than half (51.8%) of the variation in the returns of the NRN Index. In addition, the FF model results in a significant R 2 change over the CAPM, which showed that the two FF variables (SMB and HML) explained some extra variance over and above the CAPM which accounted for 19.6% of the variation in the restaurant industry stock returns. The analysis at the variable level indicates that the market index variable ( \u03b2 ) and the HML are significant at 0.01 level (see Table 6 .1 ). However, the SMB was not significant at the 0.05 level, which means that the size factor does not affect the restaurant industry stock returns while controlling for \u03b2 and HML. In practice, this means that restaurant industry portfolio behaves as a large company stock, and therefore there is no size premium when considering the overall cost of equity for the restaurant industry. It should be remembered that if you are an executive of a small restaurant company there is a high possibility that your stock returns will have a size premium.",

This method assumes that the Turkish Stock Market is integrated and thus using the U.S. market indices to estimate the cost of equity for Four Seasons is equivalent to using Ulusal 100 Market Index for the Turkish Tourism portfolio. First, I run a regression of the monthly returns of Four Seasons over the CRSPVW return for the 2001-2005 period. The results show that the \u03b2 for Four Seasons is 1.6. Next, the 5-year annualized return for the CRSP was calculated in order to estimate the MRP. The 5-year historical return for CRSP was 4.3%. The riskfree rate for the 2001-2005 period was 2.16%. As a result, the cost of equity estimate based on the CAPM for Four Seasons is as follows:",

The results reveal that, among the five APT variables, only the default risk variable (UPR) is significant at the 0.05 level. However, it is not feasible to use this variable to estimate the expected return because the regression coefficient for UPR is a negative number. As a result, the Four Seasons is likely to have a negative expected return based on the APT. As a consequence, I elect not to use the APT results in the final stage of the direct approach, since the results of the APT are in conflict with the contemporary financial theories. Therefore, I use the CAPM's estimate of 5.4% and adjust this estimate with the country risk of Turkey and Thailand. According to Damodaran (2006) , the historical risk premium for the United States is 4.80%. Turkey's country risk premium is 5.60% above the United States value and that for Thailand is 1.65% above the risk premium for the United States.

It is worth asking, would a given investor invest in a U.S. restaurant portfolio of stocks for less than 6% a year? The answer would probably be \" no. \" However, if one elects to use FF as its main cost of equity model then the possibility of obtaining more relevant results is likely to increase. As it can be seen in this example, the cost of equity by using the FF model yielded a fairly logical return which far exceeds the historical equity premium for the United States.",

This is demonstrated by the gap in the TB rates for this country (82.3% for 2001 and 16.3% for 2005). Hence, if a hypothetical investor elects to use the \" going-rate (16.3%) in 2005 then the new expected return for the Turkish Tourism portfolio would be at least twice lower than the original estimate of 43.3%. Another challenge in the direct approach for international cost of equity estimations is the low \u03b2 estimate for the Turkish Tourism portfolio (0.17). Does this mean that the tourism portfolio is five times less risky than the overall ISE Index? What if the real risk of tourism stocks is twice higher than that of the market? (This is quite likely as the \u03b2 for Four Seasons in the United States was 1.6.) If that is the case, then the Thai investor needs to require a rate of return that is more than 50% in Thai currency. How can the investor hedge his investments against the large swings in the cost of equity estimates?",

The main shortcomings stem from the challenge of applying the seminal models such as the CAPM, FF, and the APT. The second set of challenges arises when countries such as Turkey tend to have high historical rates of inflation but now are entering a more stabilized period of fiscal reforms. Thus, should an investor use the historical data or try to forecast the future interest rates in Turkey? Although the practical examples provided some answers to these questions, few more questions are left for future research. Hence, I suggest two interim solutions for this cost of equity conundrum in the emerging markets: (1) the investors and academics should either solely focus on future cash flows of the project, or (2) use simulations such as Monte Carlo in order to create multiple scenarios that approximate the investment realities of the emerging markets. Otherwise, the expected return remains to be a \" gut feeling \" estimate for foreign investors in emerging markets.",

At this point, an investor faces the following two challenges: First, what market data should he/she use in estimating the cost of equity? Should stock market data be Thai, Turkish, or North American? Second, how should he/she apply the country risk premium or exchange risk premium to his/her cost of equity estimates?To answer these questions, in this example I use two different samples. The first sample is represented by a single company-the Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts and is listed on New York Stock Exchange in 2006. The second sample is the Tourism Index (composed of seven tourism stocks) of the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE). The observation period in this study is the 5-year period between 2001 and 2005. Stock data is obtained from the Center of Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at the University of Chicago and brokerage houses in Turkey.",
