ES-DMA is a rapid particle sizing method capable of characterizing certain aspects of the structure (such as capsid proteins) and obtaining complete size distributions of viruses and virus-like particles. It was shown that ES-DMA can distinguish intact virus particles from degraded particles and measure the concentration of virus particles when calibrated with nanoparticles of known concentration. The technique has a measurement uncertainty of \u224820%, is linear over nearly 3 orders of magnitude, and has a lower limit of detection of \u224810 9 particles/mL. This quantitative assay was demonstrated for non-enveloped viruses. It is expected that ES-DMA will be a useful method for applications involving production and quality control of vaccines and gene therapy vectors for human use.",

Although each of these methods possesses particular strengths for evaluating viral products, they all have disadvantages. For example, while TEM provides high resolution images, it is expensive, relatively slow, and artifacts can be introduced from electron beam damage, sample preparation, and biases in particle selection for quantitative analysis. In contrast, dynamic light scattering is relatively fast and can analyze the sample in situ; however, it cannot accurately differentiate viral particles differing by less than 10 nm in diameter or easily quantify virus particles either (Filipe et al., 2010) . Resolving particles that are close in size is an important criteria, as viral degradation often leads to mixtures of intact and partially degraded viruses that can differ in diameter by 10 nm or less.",

The advantages of ES-DMA for characterizing vaccines include its ability to provide a direct readout of particle size distributions, to measure rapidly statistically significant populations of nanoparticles, and to detect changes in nanoparticle diameter as small as 0.3 nm, far below the size of the smallest viruses ). In addition, viruses can be identified based on particle size, thereby ruling out contaminating adventitious agents unless they are of the same size. Size Fig. 1 . ES-DMA system consisting of an electrospray-charge neutralizer to produce aerosolized, singly charged virus and protein particles, a differential mobility analyzer to separate them by their charge-to-size ratio (because electrical and drag forces act on them, Fe and F d , respectively), and a condensation particle counter to enumerate the size-selected viruses or proteins. measurement by ES-DMA also does not rely on host-specific infectivity or species specific qPCR primers.",

            "text": "Over the last decade, ES-DMA has been applied broadly to characterize phage and virus-like particles. For example, a number of studies measured the size of both large and small viruses (Bacher et al., 2001; Bothner and Siuzdak, 2004; Wick et al., 2005; Hogan et al., 2006; Thomas et al., 2004; Cole et al., 2009; Kaddis et al., 2007; Laschober et al., 2008; Pease et al., 2009; Wick et al., 2007) . Using ES-DMA size distributions Pease et al. (2011) determined the symmetry and number of proteins per capsid for PR772 (Family Tectiviridae, Genus Tectivirus), a biosafety level 1 (BSL1) simulant of adenovirus. Lute et al. (2008) and Wick et al. (2007) extended ES-DMA analyses to viruses of particular interest to biomanufacturers and filter firms by characterizing the size distributions of murine minute virus (Family Parvoviridae, parvovirus) and the BSL1 models, PP7 (Family Leviviridae, Genus Levivirus) and X174 (Family Microvaridae, Genus Microvirus) (Wick et al., 2007) used in virus filtration studies (Lute et al., 2008) and in the Parenteral Drug Association's (PDA) new nomenclature standards for small and large virus retentive filters. Wick et al. (2005) demonstrated that ES-DMA is sufficiently gentle to enveloped viruses such as alphavirus (Family Togaviridae) although there was some loss of structure in murine hepatitis virus (Family Coronaviridae, Genus Coronavirus), and sendai rodent virus (Family Paramyxoviridae, Genus Respirovirus). Using a novel recombinant virus-like particle as a test article, Pease et al. (2009) recently compared ES-DMA size distributions to those of TEM and asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation and found good agreement among the techniques for particle quantitation. Furthermore, it was shown that icosahedra viruses remain infectious following electrospray (Hogan et al., 2006; Siuzdak et al., 1996; Thomas et al., 2004) , though long tubular viruses appear to lose structural integrity and infectivity in the electrospray. Overall, this technique has the potential to analyze many types of viruses.",

            "text": "ES-DMA operates at atmospheric conditions thereby introducing a drag force on the charged particle. Thus, unlike mass spectrometry which separates particles on the basis of their massto-charge ratio, the DMA separation is based on charge-to-size ratio. In the size regime of relevance to these studies, the DMA \"size\" metric of separation is the projected areas orthogonal to the principle axes of the particles, which for a spherical particle is simply the area of a circle of the same radius (Pease et al., 2010) . Like massspectrometry, electrospray is used for sample delivery; however, in ES-DMA, droplets are immediately neutralized by passage through a radioactive source (Po-210) positioned at the exit of the electrospray. These droplets, some of which contain particles of interest, dry as they pass through the neutralizer, leaving 5-20% of the dry, aerosolized particles with a single positive charge (Weidensohler, 1988) . Scanning through a range of charge-to-size ratios gives a detailed size distribution for the virus containing solution. ES-DMA can be used to size particles ranging from three to hundreds of nanometers in diameter and differentiate spherically equivalent sizes as small as 0.3 nm at its highest reported resolution ).",

These bacteriophage models were used instead of actual mammalian viruses because they can be easily grown to high titer and can be prepared and studied under BSL1 conditions. Stocks were prepared by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation methods, and live intact phages were enumerated by plaque assays using their respective hosts, as described elsewhere (Lute et al., 2004 (Lute et al., , 2007 . The phages were then dialyzed into 2.0 mmol/L ammonium acetate, pH 7.4, in preparation for the electrospray. Studies showed that short term storage (\u2248months) in this buffer system did not significantly impact phage infectivity (results not shown). For PR772 the dialyzed sample at an initial concentration of 1.5 \u00d7 10 12 plaque forming units/mL (pfu/mL) was diluted to prepare a serial dilution of 4\u00d7, 10\u00d7, 50\u00d7, 500\u00d7 and 5000\u00d7 and have been henceforth referred to as PR772a, PR772b, PR772c, PR772d and PR772e, respectively. For PP7, dialysis a parent stock resulted in an initial concentration of 2.5 \u00d7 10 13 pfu/mL. Then a fifty times dilution from the above stock was prepared from which serial dilutions of 2\u00d7, 5\u00d7, 50\u00d7, 500\u00d7 and 1000\u00d7 were prepared and have been henceforth referred to as PP7a, PP7b, PP7c, PP7d and PP7e, respectively.",

A pressure of 3.7 psi (26 kPa) in the head space drove flow (\u224866 nL/min) through a 25 m inner diameter capillary at the exit of which a voltage was tuned to form the meniscus into a conical shape Taylor cone. The current observed in the electrospray typically varied from 290 nA to 340 nA. A stream of gas, consisting of 1.1 L/min of air, flowed coaxially with the capillary to carry the highly charged droplets into a bipolar charge neutralizer (Po-210) placed at the exit of the ES, to produce a stream of particles with a known charge distribution (Weidensohler, 1988; Kim et al., 2005) . These charged aerosolized virus particles were then passed into the differential mobility analyzer. The DMA (TSI Inc., USA, #3080) was operated with a sheath flow of 30 L/min for PP7 or 10 L/min for PR772. Because the trajectory of the virus particles is controlled by balancing the electrical and drag forces acting on them, only those with a selected charge-to-size ratio, for the applied electric field chosen, passed into the collection slit for counting. By stepping through different electric fields, a size distribution was obtained, in increments of 0.2 nm (Wang and Flagan, 1990) . The size reported in this article is the spherically equivalent size obtained using Stokes drag law corrected with the velocity slip correction (Hinds, 1999) .",

It was observed that for both PP7 and PR772 the intra-day variations were smaller than the inter-day variation, as is typical for precision studies. The larger inter-day variation was expected because over this time period, the ES-DMA system was shut down (which consists of switching off the ES, sheath flow and the CPC) and restarted which may have caused modest differences in flow rates or may have affected the performance of the DMA or the CPC. In addition, the effect of changing capillaries was also studied, an issue addressed in greater detail in Section 3.5.

First, the CPC baseline was determined by electrospraying ammonium acetate buffer through a capillary and by obtaining size distributions of this control buffer from 2 nm to 45 nm for PP7 or 2 nm to 75 nm for PR772. Then, the baseline where PP7 (21 nm to 26.8 nm) and PR772 (55 nm to 68 nm) would appear were summed to obtain the limit of detection for these viruses, respectively. This was repeated in triplicate and the uncertainty in CPC (aerosol phase) counts in the baseline was determined to be 45 particles/cc \u00b1 14 particles/cc and 7 particles/cc \u00b1 2 particles/cc for the measured size range of PP7 and PR772, respectively (data not shown). The product of the measured uncertainty with the average response functions of 20 nm and 60 nm Au nanoparticles gives a measure of the liquid phase noise level for PP7 and PR772, respectively. Further, since ICH Q2 specifications for LoD require a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1, the liquid phase noise was multiplied by three to obtain LoDs of 7.3 \u00d7 10 8 particles/mL for PP7 and 2.3 \u00d7 10 8 particles/mL for PR772, respectively. Expressing these values as plaque assay LoDs (pfu/ml) yielded 2.3 \u00d7 10 7 pfu/mL (assuming particle:infectivity ratio of \u224832) and 1.7 \u00d7 10 7 pfu/mL (assuming particle:infectivity ratio \u224814) for PP7 and PR772, respectively.

ICH Q2 calls for investigation of such parameters under the rubric of robustness. Ambient temperature variations may influence the gas flows in the ES, the DMA as well as the CPC. The performance of the DMA depends on the relative rates of a carrier gas in the DMA and the analyte carrier gas ) that arrives from the ES. Any changes in these flows can cause apparent changes in size and concentration of the particles of interest. Additionally, the flow rates may also vary slightly over time even without temperature changes. Each change may cause variation in counts and size obtained by ES-DMA assay over several hours on the same day or over several days as has been addressed under the rubric of \"repeatability\" and \"intermediate precision\" (Section 3.2). Further, the neutralizing source used for charge reduction (Po-210) has a half-life of 138 days, and should be operated under conditions of excess alpha radiation to neutralize the ionized particles. Extended operation of the same Po-201 source past one year can lead to a degraded charging efficiency. Capillaries in the electrospray often need to be changed, because of clogging from either very large impurities (micron sized) in the solution, or from deposition of particles on the electrospray tip with time, both of which affects ES-DMA concentration measurements.",

ES-DMA can achieve this objective by correlating identity with size. Thomas et al. (2004) has shown that the components of mixtures of very similar sized viruses can be distinguished based on size by ES-DMA. For example, they differentiated MS2 from RYMV based on a 4.3 nm size difference. Even though a database correlating size with identity has not yet been assembled using ES-DMA yet, a broad range of viruses can be distinguished based on their distinct mobility diameters as discussed in Section 1.",

            "text": "To make the ES-DMA conducive to biomanufacturing, ES-DMA was evaluated in the context of ICH Q2. The ratio of particles/mL to pfu/mL for a given virus remained approximately constant as a function of decreasing virus concentration (Table 1) . This suggested that the ES-DMA behaved linearly for the concentration range examined. However, the ES-DMA and plaque assay data did not yield the same counts (Table 1) , which implied that not all phage particles were infectious such that a direct comparison to infectivity data led to a 10-40 fold disparity in the measured values, a common observation in virology when comparing the infectivity assay to methods that physically count particles (Xu and Brorson, 2001; Brorson et al., 2002) . This discrepancy between the plaque assay and the ES-DMA measured concentrations presumably involves several factors. ES-DMA is a physical measurement and counts all virus particles whether \"live\" or \"dead\", while the plaque assay is infectivity count. To be infectious, a phage must land on the bacteria, penetrate the cell membrane, take over the cellular machinery, and then make copies of itself and finally lyse the bacteria. Each of these processes has an efficiency of less than 100% thus a 1:1 particle to infectivity ratio is rarely achieved for any type of virion. This also explains why the LoDs and LoQs had different limits depending on whether they were expressed with respect to particles/mL or pfu/mL. The plot of linearity (Fig. 3) showed that the data did not extrapolate through the origin, an observation consistent with that of Hogan et al. (2006) for MS2, T2, and T4 viruses suggesting possible variability in the plaque assay measurements or differences in depositional losses that arise from particles sticking to surfaces (with smaller particles showing a greater propensity to stick because Brownian diffusion is more) which may be size and species specific. PP7 gas phase counts obtained with the ES-DMA started to deviate from linearity at concentrations below \u224810 10 particles/mL perhaps because of imprecision at the LoD.",
