Justin returns from the romantic Aegean Sea and puts 124 photographs he took onto a website to share with his friends. Unexpectedly, the website becomes a hit and the address achieves wide distribution via various chain e-mails. The site helps to promote tourism to Greece, a destination relatively unknown to most Taiwanese. This investigation explores why the site appeals to so many visitors, impresses them, and even draws them to plan travel to Greece. The article describes the effect of the website by analyzing messages left on the site. The AIDA model is useful for classifying holistic messages. The data demonstrate that the website generates desire and action in over 45% of its readers. These individuals either announce plans to visit Greece immediately or at some time in the foreseeable future. The website thus significantly influences browsers and indirectly promotes Greek tourism. Then, this article describes the key success factors of this popular website. Finally, the article presents suggestions and implications for the tourism industry and for nations seeking to promote tourism.",

Taiwanese are increasingly interested in travel to Greece. Besides, Chinese Television System released the TV series 'Love of the Aegean Sea' in April 2004, and a popular first prize in numerous lottery activities is now a trip to Greece or the Cycladic Islands. Lots of newly-opened stores are using Aegean Sea themes, including restaurants, motels, bed and breakfasts, and so on. Moreover, Greek or Aegean style has become popular in many areas including architecture, painting, bedspreads, food, etc. Some explanation must exist for these rapid changes, and the answer appears to be a 2003 Yahoo Anniversary Website named 'I left my heart in Aegean Sea' (see Fig. 1 ).",

(UMC) in Taiwan, Justin returned from the Aegean Sea and put 124 photos chosen from the 1400 pictures he took during his holiday on the website of Yahoo-Kimo in May 2003. Originally Justin simply intended to share his photos with friends, and he put them on the website because they were too large to send by e-mail. On the first day, more than 6000 visitors crowded into the website. The abnormal traffic caused Yahoo-Kimo to close the website temporarily. After Yahoo-Kimo reactivated the website, visitor levels increased to tens of thousands daily. Perhaps through a desire to share with other friends, many enthusiastic friends forwarded the beautiful website message by e-mail. For several weeks 40 to 60 thousand visitors viewed the site daily. Over one million visitors visited the website during the first month, and nearly two million visited the site over a 6 month period. Locus, a publishing company, took the opportunity to publish a photo book, 2004 desk calendar and jigsaw featuring Justin's photographs. According to Zufryden (2000) , website traffic is statistically significant in predicting the box Journal of Business Research 59 (2006) 1201 -1205 office take of a new film, and thus the publisher's action made sense and good sales volumes were achieved.",

Thus travel has become a popular leisure activity. Numerous factors influence the destination choice, including advertising campaigns by destination countries, travel agency promotions, airline ticket discounting, movies or TV programs, word of mouth, personal preferences, and so on. Various nations and regions have made considerable efforts in tourism marketing and promotion. For example, Taiwan is pushing 'Doubling Tourist Arrivals Plan' and has designated 2004 as Taiwan Tourism Year; the Hong Kong Tourism Board has adopted the new slogan 'Hong Kong-Live it! Love it!' as its global advertisement and has invited the famous actor, Jackie Chan, to be a travel ambassador promoting Hong Kong. All such campaigns share a common goal of attracting more overseas tourists.",

To explore why the website appealed to so many visitors, impressing them and even leading them to plan travel to Greece is useful. The website was highly effective in place marketing, but used a different approach to those generally prescribed by marketing theory. First, the website was not built by a government agency or tourism association. Furthermore, the website did not resemble word of mouth promotion because the subject was not the tourism place itself but rather a website. These distinctions merit further study.",

Photographs provide indisputable evidence that the trip was made, that the program was carried out, that fun was had (Sontag, 1977) . Moreover, photographs help to record memories. Some scholars have studied photography in tourism. Chalfen (1979) investigated the theoretical relationships between photography and tourist types. Cohen, Nir and Almogor (1992) explored stranger-local interactions in tourism photography. Moreover, Markwell (1997) examined the spatial, temporal, and social dimensions of photography in a nature-based tour experience. Past studies primarily focused on the impacts or roles of tourism photography, but few explored its promotional function. Photographic images of places and attractions help form expectations regarding tours during the pre-travel stage (Markwell, 1997) . Therefore, photographs of scenic spots are ubiquitous, for example in travel agency or tourism bureau websites, media advertisements, guidebooks, travel brochures, postcards, and so on. The case study in this article attempts to identify the power of photographs.",

To believe that such a romantic website had been created by an engineer was difficult for many people. Maybe there was a perceived paradox in the combination of a rational engineer taking such beautiful pictures of a romantic destination such as Greece. Besides, the website creator was simply an ordinary person, not a specialist.

As such e-mails circulated, the website was introduced to millions of people and achieved an unexpectedly wide impact. Another key point was that the website was non-commercial.

These brands place these meanings at the core of their products. Charley Revson of Revlon provided an excellent example, saying 'In the factory, we make cosmetics; in the store we sell hope.' These are what Levitt (1986) calls the 'intangible properties' of the product. Consumers do not buy products for the products themselves. Similarly, browsers do not admire the website for the website itself. The intangible property of the website is a 'dream'. The website not only strikes the right chord but also touches the deepest human desires. People understand that their personal dream can be actualized through the website. Dreams thus are no longer merely dreams, but rather are realizable.",

Traditionally, nations use TV, magazines, Internet, direct mail, brochures and leaflets to conduct advertising campaigns. Additionally, they may sign contracts with other nations for exchange visits, participate in travel shows, invite overseas journalists to visit, and so on. But the key question remains successfully firing up the enthusiasm of potential tourists. \"I left my heart in Aegean Sea,\" is undoubtedly a very successful case. Simply the touching photographs accompanied by soft music could touch quite a few people and even inspire them to action. The above case provides global countries and tourism promoters with a brand-new approach to promoting tourism. This new approach is totally different from traditional approaches, but has the potential for enormous impact. All marketing personnel should move beyond traditional methods and be much more original when seeking to attract international tourists. Using non-conventional, high-impact approaches can achieve an advantage in the competitive tourism market by bringing the promoted destinations closer to their target customers.",
