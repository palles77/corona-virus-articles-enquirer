While it is intuitive that transcriptional changes in the nucleus 44 impact RNA levels in the cytoplasm, evidence in both yeast and mammalian cells now indicates 45 that the converse is also true: altered cytoplasmic mRNA decay rates can broadly impact 46 transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In yeast, stabilizing the cytoplasmic mRNA pool by 47 (ChIP-seq) in mock versus MHV68 infected MC57G mouse fibroblasts at 24 hours post 96 infection (hpi). As a control, we also infected cells with a version of MHV68 containing the 97 point mutation R443I in the viral muSOX endonuclease gene, which reduces its mRNA cleavage 98 activity. R443I retains a similar lytic cycle and infectious capability to wildtype (WT) MHV68 in 99 vivo and in vitro its infectious capability is similar to MHV68 in mouse fibroblasts (6,23). 100",

To test this, we 197 measured the Pol II occupancy and transcriptional potential of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) 198 promoter, which drives green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression on the MHV68 genome. 199 Unlike alpha-and gammaherpesviruses, the betaherpesvirus CMV does not accelerate mRNA 200 decay.

In contrast, promoters on the replicating viral genome recruit Pol II 226 with similar efficiency during normal or accelerated mRNA decay, indicating that they escape 227 transcriptional inhibition. This protection is lost upon relocation of the viral promoters into the 228 host genome or when the viral genome is in a latent state, emphasizing the importance of DNA 229",

            "text": "from the alphaherpesvirus HSV-1. HSV-1 infection results in a genome-wide 256 reduction in Pol II occupancy of host chromatin and reduced nascent RNA production of the 257 majority of host transcripts (34-36). Furthermore, early data showed that while the endogenous 258 mouse b-globin locus was transcriptionally repressed during HSV-1 infection, its expression was 259 rescued upon integration of the b-globin gene into the HSV-1 genome (37,38). Experiments with 260 gene-specific null viruses have implicated immediate early (IE) proteins in the HSV-1 261 transcriptional repression phenotype, including ICP27, which can accelerate mRNA turnover 262 (36,39). Additionally, we have previously published, and confirm in this report, that transfection 263 of HSV-1 vhs, another broad acting endoribonuclease, is sufficient to induce reduced Pol II 264 occupancy of several host promoters (21). Thus, in addition to targeting host and viral mRNAs 265 for cytoplasmic decay, both alpha and gammaherpesviruses restrict Pol II occupancy of the host 266 genome, although additional work is needed to establish whether the underlying mechanism is 267 similar. 268 During the lytic stage of herpesvirus infection, viral DNA is localized to replication 269 compartments. These non-membrane bound structures are sites of viral genome replication, 270 transcription, and packaging (40). They are enriched for many host and viral proteins involved in 271 these processes, including chromatin modifying factors and Pol II (28-30). Replication 272 compartments grow and coalesce over infection, excluding host chromatin, which becomes 273 pushed to the nuclear periphery (25-27). We recently showed that muSOX and Xrn1-coordinated 274 mRNA decay causes differential trafficking of many cellular RNA binding proteins between the 275 PABPC from these compartments is not the mechanism by which the viral genome 279 escapes repression. Instead, we hypothesize that either the state of viral DNA or other protective 280 features of the replication compartment confers escape from transcriptional repression. 281 Protection from mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression was not conferred to 282 non-MHV68 or viral promoters present on the latent viral episome, indicating that lytic phase 283 viral DNA replication or replication compartment formation is key to this phenotype. The latent 284 genomes of gammaherpesviruses including KSHV and Epstein Bar Virus (EBV) are heavily 285 methylated and histone-rich, with the exception of promoters of genes expressed during latency, 286 the latent origin of replication, and CTCF binding sites (41-43). Notably, during latency key lytic 287 promoters like RTA contain both the activating H3K4me3 and the repressive H3K27me3 histone 288 marks, representing a 'poised' state (44). Rapid changes shortly after lytic cycle induction result 289 in hypomethylation and removal of repressive marks at early gene promoters (41,44). At later 290 stages of infection, KSHV, EBV and HSV-1 genomes have been shown to be largely 291 nucleosome free, consistent with histones not being packaged in virions (27,29,45). For 292 gammaherpesviruses, this is the stage at which mRNA degradation is most pronounced. We 293 therefore hypothesize that the 'open' state of viral DNA during lytic replication plays an 294 important role in facilitating Pol II recruitment under conditions of accelerated cytoplasmic 295 mRNA decay. Future work is geared towards exploring whether widespread mRNA decay alters 296 cellular chromatin states and DNA accessibility and, if so, how this influences",

The promoter of M4 was defined as the 1131bp upstream of the M4 314 coding region not overlapping with other viral ORFs and the promoter sequence of M7 was 315 previously published (46). pGL3-kLANA-puromycin was made by introducing the puromycin 316 gene into the I-CeuI and XbaI sites of pGL3-kLANA via InFusion (Clonetech) cloning. pGL3-317 kLANA was made by amplifying KSHV's LANA promoter sequence (47) and using InFusion 318 cloning to introduce it into the XhoI and HindIII sites of pGL3. To reactivate iSLK cells, they were treated with 1 \u00b5g/mL doxycycline and 1 mM 325 sodium butyrate for 48 hours. 326 DNA transfections were carried out in 293T cells at 70-90% confluency in 10 cm plates 327 with 10 \u00b5g host-shutoff factor plasmid or vector control using PolyJet (SignaGen) 24 hours 328 before harvesting and again at 18 hours before harvesting. 329Lentiviral transduction was carried out by spinfecting 1x10 6 293T or MC57G cells with 330 lentivirus made from 2 nd generation plasmids at a MOI <1 for 2 hours with 4 \u00b5g/mL polybrene 331 (Fisher). Twenty-four hours later puromycin (1 \u00b5g/ml for 293T or 3 \u00b5g/ml for MC57G) was 332 added to select for transduced cells.293T cells stably expressing the kLANA-puromycin cassette 333 were made by transfecting the cells with 1 \u00b5g pGL3-kLANA-puromycin using PolyJet, then 334 selecting with puromycin for random integration events. 335 For the CMV-luciferase promoter assay, populations of 293T cells expressing muSOX 336 were selected 24 hours post-transfection using the Miltenyi Biotec MACS cell separation system 337 according to the manufacturer's instructions as previously described (22). 338 293T cells were infected with KSHV by reactivating iSLK-Bac16 cells for 48 hours and 339 then spinfecting cell-free virus onto a monolayer of 293T cells, as described for lentiviral 340 production but in the absence of polybrene. 341 3 million MC57G cells were nucleofected with a 100uL Neon tip (1400 Voltage/20 342 Width/2 Pulse) to knockdown Xrn1 using a pool of 4 siRNAs (Dharmacon M-046621-01) or a 343 non-targeting control (Dharmacon D-001206-14) using 10 \u00b5L of 20 \u00b5M siRNA. 344 supplemented with 10% FBS for 10 min then washed with PBS.

            "text": "). Pol II ChIP qPCR across various regions of 147 ORF54 and ORF37 also showed a similar Pol II signal throughout each gene body and at their 148 promoter. We did note a decrease in signal near the TTS of ORF54, however this was true for 149 both WT and R443I infections (Fig 2C). We hypothesize that pervasive transcription of the viral 150 genome at 24 hpi, compounded by the presence of TSSs on both Watson and Crick strands, 151 likely contributes to this phenotype. 152 PABPC is not excluded from viral replication compartments 154 We next considered how the viral genome maintains high levels of Pol II occupancy 155 during accelerated mRNA decay. During replication, viral DNA is transcribed within viral 156 replication compartments (RCs) in the nucleus, which exclude host DNA and thus stain poorly 157 with DAPI (25-27). Although they are not membrane bound, these compartments selectively 158 enrich for factors required for viral replication (such as the viral processivity factor ORF59) and 159 gene expression (such as Pol II) (28-30). Virus-induced mRNA decay causes increased 160 trafficking of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, 161 which we have recently linked to transcriptional repression (22,31). To determine whether 162replication compartments selectively exclude nuclear PABPC as a means of avoiding 163 transcriptional repression, we monitored its localization in cells lytically infected with MHV68 164 or KSHV. As expected, the majority of infected cells displayed increased nuclear PABPC 165 compared to unreactivated or uninfected cells as measured by immunofluorescence (IF). We 166 further saw that PABPC was not excluded from replication compartments(Fig 3A, B and S2 Fig 167 A). To determine PABPC localization relative to RCs, we first identified cells with RCs by 168 looking for regions of Pol II or ORF59 staining that excluded DAPI. We then quantified nuclear 169 PABPC pixel intensity, and counted cells as having an overlapping RC/PABPC signal when the 170 PABPC pixel intensity was at least 2x that of cells without nuclear PABPC from the same image. 171Indeed, 85 percent of MHV68 infected cells showed overlapping PABPC/Pol II signal and 90 172 percent of reactivated iSLKs showed an overlapping PABPC/ORF59 signal (Fig 3C). Thus, 173 PABPC exclusion from RCs is unlikely to underlie viral promoter escape. 174 Viral promoters fail to escape transcriptional repression outside of the viral genome 176",
