            "text": "Simian hemorrhagic fever virus is an arterivirus that naturally infects species of African nonhuman primates causing acute or persistent asymptomatic infections. Although it was previously estimated that 1% of baboons are SHFV-positive, more than 10% of wild-caught and captive-bred baboons tested were SHFV positive and the infections persisted for more than 10 years with detectable virus in the blood (100-1000 genomes/ml). The sequences of two baboon SHFV isolates that were amplified by a single passage in primary macaque macrophages had a high degree of identity to each other as well as to the genome of SHFV-LVR, a laboratory strain isolated in the 1960s. Infection of Japanese macaques with 100 PFU of a baboon isolate consistently produced high level viremia, pro-inflammatory cytokines, elevated tissue factor levels and clinical signs indicating coagulation defects. The baboon virus isolate provides a reliable BSL2 model of viral hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques. (M.A. Brinton). Virology 474 (2015) 186-198 ",

Mortality approached 100% by 2 weeks after infection Gravell et al., 1980) . The clinical signs of an SHFV infection in macaques closely resemble those of other hemorrhagic fever viruses such as Ebola, Marburg and Lassa viruses (Mahanty and Bray, 2004; Bray, 2005) . Viral hemorrhagic fever disease is characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from infected macrophages (M\u03a6s) and dendritic cells (DCs) that induces tissue factor production and subsequent disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (Geisbert et al., 2003b; Bray, 2005; Levi et al., 2006) . Previous SHFV outbreaks in primate facilities are thought to have been initiated by inadvertent blood-to-blood transmission from a persistently infected African nonhuman primate (NHP) to a macaque (London, 1977) . In the case of an outbreak at NIH, virus was likely transmitted by the use of the same needle for tattooing or tuberculosis testing of multiple NHPs of African and Asian origin Palmer et al., 1968; Tauraso et al., 1968) . SHFV is typically transmitted between African NHPs during fighting but can spread efficiently among macaques by both direct and indirect contact (London, 1977; Renquist, 1990) .",

EAV and PRRSV infections can cause diseases in susceptible host species characterized by fever, anorexia, tissue necrosis, inflammation of the respiratory tract and reproductive failure, such as spontaneous abortions or delivery of weak offspring (Snijder and Kikkert, 2013) . In mice, LDV typically causes lifelong, asymptomatic, persistent infections that are characterized by increased serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (Brinton and Plagemann, 1983; Snijder and Kikkert, 2013) . Due to the significant agricultural impact of diseases caused by EAV and PRRSV, the majority of research on arteriviruses has been focused on these two viruses.",

Although the origin of this virus is not known for certain, patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) housed in the same facility were later found to be persistently infected with SHFV and to be the source of the SHFV infecting new rhesus macaques in subsequent epizootics in the same facility (London, 1977) . Although SHFV LVR efficiently induced SHF disease in macaques in the 1960s , in a recent study, no correlation was observed between virus dose (ranging from 50 to 500,000 PFU/ml) and efficiency of induction of fatal hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques (Johnson et al., 2011) . Bacterial sepsis was detected in 75% (12 of 16) of the SHFV-infected animals that did not survive suggesting that this played a major role in mortality.

The data indicated that more than 10% of both populations were SHFV-infected compared to the previous estimate of 1% (London, 1977) . Data from serial archival samples used for testing indicated that animals remained infected for at least 10 years. Persistently infected baboons had very low levels of viremia. SHFV isolates from two persistently infected baboons (410 years) were amplified once in primary macaque M\u03a6s and subsequently sequenced. The genome sequences of these isolates were very similar both to each other and to that of SHFV LVR, an isolate from the 1960s from a macaque that may have been infected with virus originating from a patas monkey. Intravenous injection of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) with 100 PFU of one of the baboon SHFV isolates resulted in consistent induction of severe hemorrhagic fever disease, characterized by high level viremia, the production of proinflammatory cytokines, elevation of tissue factor and coagulopathy, in each of four infected animals. Cells co-expressing viral nonstructural proteins and the M\u03a6 marker CD68 were detected in liver and spleen. Sepsis was not identified in any of the macaques. SHFV infection in macaques has been proposed as a BSL2 model for viral hemorrhagic fever disease (Johnson et al., 2011) . Using the new baboon isolate of SHFV and Japanese macaques, we demonstrated consistent disease induction in the absence of bacterial infection with a low dose virus inoculum. 1 . Detection of SHFV RNA by RT-PCR in baboon sera. RNA isolated from 100 \u03bcl of baboon serum was analyzed by one-step RT-PCR. Pairs of primers were designed to amplify (A) nucleocapsid or (B) helicase regions of the SHFV genome. RNA extracted from an aliquot of a stock pool of SHFV-LVR containing 10 7 PFU/ml of virus was used as the positive control and nuclease-free water was used as the negative control. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels. Lane 1, SHFV-LVR RNA; lane 2, water; lane 3, SHFV-positive baboon serum; and lane 4, SHFV-negative baboon serum. The results shown are representative of the results obtained for sera from a total of 33 SHFV-positive and 166 SHFV-negative baboons.

Primer sets were designed to target sequences in the SHFV-LVR nucleocapsid and helicase genes that are well conserved among different arteriviruses. The primers were first tested using RNA extracted from an SHFV-LVR pool made from a three times plaque purified virus stock. A single 300 bp PCR product was detected with the nucleocapsid primers (Fig. 1A, lane 1) . With the helicase primer set, the expected 700 bp PCR product and also a second unexpected 350 bp product were observed indicating the presence of defective genomes with an internal deletion in the helicase region in the LVR pool (Fig. 1B , lane 1). No PCR products were detected in the RNA-free water lanes (lane 2, Fig. 1A and B). The ability of the two RT-PCR assays to detect SHFV RNA in NHP sera was next tested using a single archived serum sample from each of 120 different wild-caught baboons introduced into the colony at the Southwest National Primate Research Center between 1981 and 1997. RNA from each serum sample was isolated and separately amplified by RT-PCR with each of the two primer sets. PCR bands of the expected sizes were detected for 17 of the 120 samples in both the nucleocapsid and helicase assays (lane 3, Fig. 1A and B, data not shown). However, the additional 350 bp product detected with SHFV LVR RNA in the helicase assay was not detected in helicase assays done on sera from the 17 positive baboons (lane 4, Fig. 1A and B, data not shown). No PCR bands were detected for the remaining 103 baboon serum samples with either assay (data not shown). All 17 of the positive wild caught animals were Olive baboons (Papio hamadryas anubis). Two of the 26 male samples and 15 of the 94 female samples were positive. The data indicate that a total of 14.2% of the 120 wild-caught baboons that entered the colony during this 16 year period were SHFV positive. The RT-PCR assays were then used to test a plasma sample from each baboon from the Southwest National Primate Research Center colony used to collect whole blood samples for differentiation of M\u03a6s and mDCs . The animals sampled were ones that were in the clinic for their yearly check-up or for treatment of lacerations due to fighting between animals housed together and therefore did not represent a random sampling of the entire colony. Of the 85 colony-born baboons tested (18 females and 67 males), 16 (19%) were positive by both the nucleocapsid and helicase assays (data not shown). Two of the positive animals were females and 14 were males. The helicase assays detected only the 700 bp band. Eight of the colony-born, SHFV-positive animals were Olive baboons (P. hamadryas anubis), 6 were Olive/Yellow hybrids (P. hamadryas anubis/Papio hamadryas cynocephalus), one was a Hamadryas (Sacred) baboon (Papio hamadryas) and one was a Chacma/Olive hybrid (Papio ursinus/P. hamadryas anubis). The ages of the positive animals ranged from 8 to 23 years. The data indicated that SHFV is being transmitted between baboons within the colony.",

The B15701 and B14815 sera contained $ 10 2 genome copies/ml while the B11661 and B11662 sera contained $ 10 3 genome copies/ml (data not shown). These data indicated that the virus levels in the blood of persistently infected baboons were low. To analyze the viral genomic sequence, serum samples (200 \u03bcl) were first filtered to remove bacteria and then virus particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation. The pellet was treated with RNase and DNase and then nucleic acid was extracted and subjected to 454 sequencing as described in Materials and methods. The reads were aligned with the SHFV LVR sequence (accession number AF180391.2). The genome coverage obtained was very low (15% or less). The two samples with higher copy numbers (B11661 and B11662) gave the highest levels of coverage. Sequences for primate viruses, including Torque teno virus and several primate herpesviruses as well as bacteriophages, such as Bacillus phage SPO1 and Prochlorococcus phage P-SSM2, were detected in high abundance. It was expected that the genomes of these other infectious agents outcompeted the SHFV genome for the random 454 primer sets.",

Serum (200 ml) from 4 baboons (B11661, B11662, B19927 and B25360) was separately used to infect rhesus macaque M\u03a6 cultures. Cells from a different macaque were used for each baboon sample. Culture fluids were collected at 24 h intervals and tested by RT-PCR. By 120 h after infection, both the nucleocapsid and helicase RT-PCR assays detected the presence of SHFV RNA in all of the culture fluids (data not shown). The culture fluids were also analyzed for infectivity by plaque assay on MA104 cells. Virus titers for the B11661 and B11662 120 h culture fluids were 10 4 PFU/ml and for B19927 and B25360 120 h culture fluids were 10 3 PFU/ml. Rhesus macaque M\u03a6-amplified B11662 and B11661 culture fluids (1 ml) were then processed as described above and analyzed by 454 sequencing. These two isolates were chosen for sequencing because they were from animals infected for more than 10 years and contained 10 fold higher infectivity titers than the other two isolate samples. Nearly complete sequences for both (B11662 94.8% and B11661 99.7% coverage of LVR) and a low background of other sequences were obtained. Compared to the SHFV-LVR sequence (accession number AF180391.2), the sequence of the B11661 isolate varied at 7 nt positions while the genome of the B11662 isolate varied at 10 nt positions ( Table 1) . Most of the changes in B11662 differed from those in B11661. The partial B11661 and B11662 genomic sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KM655765 and KM655766, respectively. The very high sequence conservation observed between the genomes of two SHFV isolates obtained from baboons that were each persistently infected for more than 10 years and also between the genomes of these two baboon viruses and SHFV-LVR which was isolated in the 1970s was unexpected.",

Because of the high sequence similarity between the B11661 and B11662 baboon isolates and LVR, we postulated that the baboon isolates would have a virulence phenotype similar to LVR in macaques.

The authors hypothesized that virus-induced immunosuppression led to the development of sepsis in animals that had existing or opportune bacterial infections. The presence of bacterial sepsis in many of the animals made it difficult to discriminate the relative contributions of the SHFV infection and of the bacterial infection to the host response parameters measured. To try to avoid bacterial co-infection, healthy animals from a Japanese macaque (JM) colony at the Oregon National Primate Research Center were used to test the ability of the B11661 isolate to induce hemorrhagic disease. The B11661 isolate was chosen because a complete coding region sequence was obtained for this isolate. Although data on SHFV infections in several macaque species have been previously reported (rhesus, cynomolgus and stump-tailed) London, 1977; Johnson et al., 2011) , no data on SHFV infections in JMs has been reported. Four animals were infected in two experimental cohorts, each comprised of two animals. Each animal was injected intravenously with 100 PFU of macaque M\u03a6-amplified SHFV B11661 diluted in PBS. The first two animals (JM-23333 and JM-24054) developed fever and lethargy by 3 days post-infection (dpi). By 7 dpi, one macaque (JM-23333) was febrile, lethargic and anorexic and was euthanized. Because of the possibility that the non-specific clinical signs noted in JM-23333 could have been associated with bacterial sepsis in addition to SHFV infection, the second macaque (JM-24054) was treated with an antibiotic on day 9. At 13 dpi, JM-24054 displayed severe hemorrhagic fever disease signs that reached a clinical score of 10 and was euthanized ( Table 2) .",

Infection of macaques with small doses of Zaire Ebola typically induces fever by 3-4 days, hemorrhagic fever disease signs by 5-6 days, and morbidity by 7-8 days. Similar disease induction kinetics and a similar progression of disease parameters were observed in the SHFV-infected macaques. The primary target cells of both Ebola virus and SHFV in macaques are M\u03a6s and DCs (Geisbert et al., 2003c; . At late times of infection, Ebola virus also infects parenchymal cells, hepatocytes, adrenal cortical cells and fibroblasts (Bray and Mahanty, 2003; Mahanty and Bray, 2004) . Although SHFV-infected M\u03a6s were present in the livers and spleens of moribund animals, adjacent cells in these organs were not positive for viral antigen.

Next, the sections were incubated with a mouse anti-CD68 antibody, then a biotinylated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and then streptavidin Alexa Fluor 594. Nuclei were visualized with Hoechst 33258 staining. Cells were visualized using a Zeiss Axioscope 2 plus microscope equipped with a digital camera.

Ebola virus infected M\u03a6s and DCs produce proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and tissue factor that induce vasodilation, increase vascular permeability and disseminated intravascular coagulation (Geisbert et al., 2003d; Bray and Geisbert, 2005) . Pro-inflammatory cytokines also cause bystander lymphocyte apoptosis in Ebola virus infected macaques (Geisbert et al., 2003b; Ruf, 2004; Bray, 2005) . SHFV-infection of cultured macaque M\u03a6s and myloid DCs induces proinflammatory cytokines and proinflammatory cytokine production, decreased PBMC lymphocyte populations and tissue lymphocyte necrosis were detected in all four of the JMs infected with SHFV. Neither Ebola virus nor SHFV can infect lymphocytes, implying that the two viruses induce lymphocytosis by related indirect mechanisms. Although CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe cell populations were decreased in all four SHFV-infected animals between days 2 and 6 after infection, cell numbers increased thereafter suggesting the activation of an adaptive immune response. Humans who mount a rapid and robust immune response can survive an Ebola virus infection (Mahanty and Bray, 2004) and therapeutic recombinant antibodies as well as transfusions from Ebola survivors have enhanced patient survival. However, if an immune response was initiated in the SHFV infected macaques, it did not alter the progression of hemorrhagic fever disease.",

In the present study, a total of 205 baboons from a colony in the USA were tested for SHFV using RT-PCR assays targeting two conserved regions of the SHFV genome. These assays provided a sensitive and consistent method for detecting persistently infected animals. The data obtained from archived samples from wild-caught Olive baboons introduced into the colony over a 16 year period indicated that 14.2% not 1% of these animals were infected with SHFV. However, because blood samples obtained at the time of capture were not available for any of the wild-caught animals, it could not be determined whether these animals were infected in the wild or after capture. The percentage of opportunistically sampled animals living in the colony that were SHFV positive was 19% which was also much higher than 1%. However, the majority of the colony animals that were sampled were males that were in the clinic for treatment of lacerations obtained during fighting and this percentage is therefore expected to be higher than that for the entire colony. Multiple baboon species as well as hybrid animals in the colony were found to be SHFV positive. The data obtained on the colony-bred animals clearly indicated that SHFV continues to be transmitted between animals after introduction into a captive baboon colony. Additional species of African NHPs, red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles) and redtailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius) were recently reported to be infected with SHFV in the wild (Lauck et al., 2013; Bailey et al., 2014) . The sequences of these SHFV isolates are divergent from LVR and whether they can infect macaques and cause hemorrhagic fever disease is not known.",

            "text": "A single previous study reported that patas monkeys could remain SHFV positive for up to 13 years as indicated by detection of antibody to purified SHFV LVR in an ELISA (Gravell et al., 1986) . The duration of persistent SHFV infections in baboons had not previously been tested. Baboons in the present study were also found to remain SHFV-positive for at least 10 years. Data from SHFV RT-PCR assays done on serially diluted sera from persistently infected baboons indicated that the viremia levels in these animals are low ( $ 100 to 1000 genome copies/ml) and SHFV was also reported to grow to low titers in baboon M\u03a6s and mDCs . Attempts to sequence SHFV genome RNA directly from baboon plasma by 454 sequencing yielded only short contigs representing 15% or less of the genome. However, nearly complete sequences were obtained from virus that was amplified by a single passage in rhesus macaque M\u03a6 cultures. The single passage in macaque M\u03a6 may have selected for a virus subpopulation that can efficiently infect and replicate in macaque M\u03a6s and therefore the full diversity of the virus populations in the persistently infected animals was not analyzed. Baboons B11661 and B11662 were housed together only in the early 1990s and it is possible that one infected the other. However, it was still surprising that the genome sequences obtained for the SHFV isolates from these two long term (410 years) persistently infected baboons were so similar to each other and even more surprising that these sequences were also very similar to the sequence of SHFV LVR (AF180391.2) , which was isolated in 1964 . Although coronavirus genomes encode proofreading enzymes, arterivirus genomes do not (Denison et al., 2011) . A major contributing factor to the low sequence divergence observed for the baboon and LVR SHFV isolates may be the low level of virus replication in the target cells in these animals .",

            "text": "In experimental SHFV infection studies done in the 1960s, inoculation of low doses of SHFV from infected macaque serum by the intramuscular route consistently induced severe hemorrhagic disease in macaques Tauraso et al., 1968) . In contrast, in a 2011 study, no correlation between SHFV LVR dose (50-500,000 PFU) and hemorrhagic disease induction was observed (Johnson et al., 2011) . The LVR used in the 2011 study was generated by three freeze-thaw cycles of infected MA104 cells. The large amount of cell and viral RNA present in these lysates would be expected to activate cell RNA sensors and strongly induce the host antiviral response which may have contributed to the decreased efficiency of hemorrhagic disease induction observed. It is also possible that defective SHFV genomes present in the inoculum may have reduced the efficiency of virus replication. In the present study, baboon SHFV in culture fluid from primary macaque M\u03a6s was diluted in PBS and animals were injected with 100 PFU by the intravenous route. This inoculation route was chosen because it closely approximates natural transmission conditions and was expected to facilitate efficient infection of peripheral M\u03a6s and DCs. Consistent hemorrhagic disease induction with similar kinetics of viremia, of proinflammatory cytokine production, and of hemorrhagic disease development was observed in all of the animals tested. Virus titers in blood and viral RNA levels in PBMCs remained high throughout the course of the infection. No evidence of bacterial sepsis was observed in any of the SHFV-infected JMs in the present study. Three of the four animals were treated with antibiotics as a precaution. The only effect of providing antibiotics and supportive care to SHFV-infected rhesus macaques observed during 1960s epizootics \"was a shortening of the course of the hemorrhagic disease resulting in earlier death\" ). The consistent induction of severe hemorrhagic disease with similar kinetics achieved in macaques after inoculation of a low dose of a baboon isolate of SHFV indicates that this represents an improved BSL2 model of viral hemorrhagic fever disease for studying viral and host factors controlling disease severity. The availability of multiple animal models of viral hemorrhagic fever is expected to facilitate the development of broad based therapeutics to treat disease complications associated with hemorrhage and coagulation disorders. As has become evident during the recent Ebola outbreak in Africa, there is an urgent need for therapies targeting hemorrhagic disease complications for use in combination with virus-specific therapies to enhance the chance of patient recovery.",

Membranes were blocked with 1X TBS containing 5% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 before incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of sheep anti-human tissue factor antibody (Cedarlane Labs) in the presence of blocking buffer. Actin was used as a loading control and was detected with a 1:20,000 dilution of antibody C-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were washed with 1X TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep or antimouse; Santa Cruz). Washed blots were then processed for chemiluminescence using a Super-Signal West Pico detection kit (Pierce Scientific) according to manufacturer's protocol.",

The samples were then embedded in paraffin and cut into 5 \u03bcm thick sections. The sections were mounted onto slides, deparaffinized and hydrated. The sections were then incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum and Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit buffer (Vector Laboratories) to block endogenous biotin and biotin receptors and avidin binding sites present in tissues. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched by standard techniques. Tissue sections were first incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-nsp1\u03b2 or anti-nap1\u03b3 antibody diluted 1:500 in antibody diluent (DAKO) overnight at 4 1C and then with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories) for 30 m at room temperature. After washing, the sections were incubated for 30 m with peroxidase ABC (Vector Laboratories) and then with streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) for 30 m at room temperature. After washing, the sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum and then incubated with anti-M\u03a6 antibody (mouse anti-CD68, DAKO) diluted 1:80 overnight at 4 1C in antibody diluent (DAKO). Detection of biotinylated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was performed with ABC (Vector Laboratories) and incubated with streptavidin Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) for 30 m at room temperature. Sections were stained with Hoechst 33258 dye (Sigma-Aldrich) to visualize nuclei. Stained slides were covered with prolong gold imaging medium (Invitrogen). Images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioscope 2 plus microscope, Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc.) equipped with a digital camera (Zeiss Axio-Cam) and filter cubes were used to document specific Alexa 488, Alexa 594 and Hoechst fluorescence. Mouse IgG 1 isotype (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used as an isotype control antibody and did not give a positive signal on tissue from infected animals (data not shown).",

Plasma samples collected at the indicated times after infection were titrated for infectivity by plaque assay in MA104 cells. Each data point is the average of duplicate titrations. (B) Viral RNA copy numbers in PBMCs. Total cell RNA was extracted from PBMCs collected at the indicated times after infection and plus-sense, genome and subgenomic viral RNA was amplified by real-time RT-PCR and quantified using a standard curve generated with a known concentration of viral RNA. (C, D) Relative quantification (RQ) of intracellular IFN\u03b2 mRNA in PBMCs by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. PBMC RNA was used to measure IFN\u03b2 mRNA levels. IFN\u03b2 mRNA levels are expressed as the fold change in the levels of IFN\u03b2 mRNA in PBMCs from an infected animal versus the level in the same animal at day zero. The amount of IFN\u03b2 mRNA in each sample was normalized to the level of 18S rRNA in the same sample. Values shown are the averages of assays done in triplicate. Error bars represent standard error (E-I) IFN\u03b1 and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the plasma were quantified by multiplexed ELISA. Values shown are the averages of assays done in triplicate. Error bars represent standard deviation. (J) Tissue factor expression in PBMCs collected on different days after infection was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-tissue factor antibody. Actin was used as a loading control. Representative gels are shown.",
