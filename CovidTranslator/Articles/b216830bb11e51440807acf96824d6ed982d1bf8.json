            "text": "Cell Research | www.cell-research.com Antiviral effects of IFN-\u03b1 against MHV-1 220 npg ORIGINAL ARTICLE Introduction In March 2003, a number of laboratories independently reported the isolation and characterization of a novel coronavirus (CoV) from specimens of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1, 2]. Although an effective therapeutic strategy against SARS has yet to be developed, interferons (IFN) are recognized to play critical roles in host resistance to viral infection [3-6], thereby implicating them as potential candidates for SARS CoV treatment. IFNs inhibit viral infection by directly interfer-ing with viral replication and by inducing both an innate and adaptive immune response to infection. IFN-\u03b1s are effective in the treatment of hepatitis B and C [7, 8] and respiratory coronavirus infections unrelated to the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV [9-12]. IFN-\u03b1s and IFN-\u03b2 [13-17], and combinations of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 [15,18] are effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV replication in vitro. Moreover, it was reported that macacque monkeys were protected from infection with SARS CoV by treatment with IFN-\u03b1 [19]. IFN alfacon-1 (Infergen, Intermune Corp, Brisbane, California), a synthetic IFN-\u03b1 designed to represent a consensus IFN-\u03b1 [20], has been shown in both cell culture systems [21] and comparative clinical trials [22] to inhibit viral replication more potently than other IFN-\u03b1s. Based on these findings, a pilot study to evaluate the potential clinical benefit and safety of IFN alfacon-1 in SARS treatment was conducted by our laboratory. Patients treated with Interferon (IFN)-\u03b1s bind to and activate their cognate cell surface receptor to invoke an antiviral response in target cells. Well-described receptor-mediated signaling events result in transcriptional regulation of IFN sensitive genes, effectors of this antiviral response. Results from a pilot study to evaluate the clinical efficacy of IFN-\u03b1 treatment of SARS patients provided evidence for IFN-inducible resolution of disease. In this report we examined the contribution of IFN-inducible phosphorylation-activation of specific signaling effectors to protection from infection by a SARS-related murine coronavirus, MHV-1. As anticipated, the earliest receptor-activation event, Jak1 phosphorylation, is critical for IFN-inducible protection from MHV-1 infection. Additionally, we provide evidence for the contribution of two kinases, the MAP kinase p38MAPK, and protein kinase C (PKC) d to antiviral protection from MHV-1 infection. Notably, our data suggest that MHV-1 infection, as for the Urbani SARS coronoavirus, inhibits an IFN response, inferred from the lack of activation of pkr and 2'5'-oas, genes associated with mediating the antiviral activities of IFN-\u03b1s. To identify potential target genes that are activated downstream of the IFN-inducible signaling effectors we identified, and that mediate protection from coronavirus infection, we examined the gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of SARS patients who received IFN treatment. A subset of differentially regulated genes were distinguished with functional properties associated with antimicrobial activities.",

High affinity binding of IFNs to IFNAR induces association of the two receptor chains and subsequent reciprocal transphosphorylation and activation of the associated Janus kinases (Jaks). The Jak-STAT (signal transducer and activator transcription) pathway induces IFN-mediated signal transduction and transcriptional activation, and is required for antiviral responses [25] . In recent years it has become apparent that activation of the IFNRassociated Jaks also regulates multiple downstream signal transducing molecules, such as the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) [26] , CrkL [27] , phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase [28] , the protein kinase C family (PKC) [29] , and the Vav proto-oncogene [30] .

Phylogenetic data suggest that the SARS-CoV is a distinct group 2 coronavirus [35, 36] . Previous studies have shown that IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 provide protection from MHV-A59 and MHV-2 infections in vivo [37, 38] . In ongoing experiments, we have evidence that MHV-1, when injected intra-nasally into mice, will induce a lung infection indistinguishable from that of the SARS-CoV infection in humans (G Levy et al., UHN, unpublished) . Specifically, A/J mice are highly susceptible to intranasal infection with MHV-1, develop pulomonary disease characterized by marked pulmonary congestion, hyaline membranes, interstitial thickening and inflammation and alveolar exudates similar to SARS lung disease in humans. Accordingly, to understand the mechanism of action of IFN alfacon-1 in limiting SARS-CoV infection in humans, we developed an in vitro model system, using C3H murine L2 lung fibroblast cells, permissive for MHV-1 infection. In this report we provide evidence for the direct antiviral effects of IFN-\u03b1 against MHV-1 and identify several signaling effectors which mediate these effects. Additionally, by examining the changes in gene expression profiles in the PBMC of SARS patients who received IFN alfacon-1 treatment, we identify a subset of IFN-responsive genes whose differential expression may influence resolution of disease.",

To examine the influence of specific IFN activated signaling effectors in protection from MHV-1 infection, we studied the effects of a number of pharmacological inhibitors targeted against specific signaling molecules. High affinity binding of IFN to IFNAR leads to the phosphorylation-activation of the receptor-associated Jaks, Jak1 and Tyk2. L2 cells treated with the Jak1 inhibitor, Jak inhibitor 1, led to a reduction in IFN-\u03b14 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 ( Figure  1C ). Additionally, we observed a reduction in IFN-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2 and STAT3 ( Figure 1D ). When L2 cells were treated with the Jak 1 inhibitor prior to IFN treatment, then infected with MHV-1, we observed a reduction in IFN-inducible protection from MHV-1 infection ( Figure 1B) . As a negative control, we examined the effect of the inhibitor AG490, which specifically inhibits Jak2 at 100 \u00b5M [45] .

For comparison we measured gene expression in the PBMC of a SARS patient that was treated with corticosteroids alone (see Materials and Methods). PBMC were sampled on days 6, 8, 10 and 13 post-onset of symptoms. For the IFN-treated SARS patients, the day 6 PBMC sample represented a baseline in the absence of IFN treatment, whereas days 8, 10 and 13 corresponded to days 2, 4 and 7 relative to the start of IFN treatment. The data in Table 3 reveal 2 lists of genes expressed differentially between the 2 IFN-treated SARS patients and the 1 non-IFN treated patient, using a cut-off of > (A) or < (B) 3-fold change in expression, relative to basal expression levels on day 6 post-onset of symptoms. In Figure 3 , differentially expressed genes are clustered to indicate high and low gene expression, using a red-green colour scale to show the relative range. Notably, our analyses identified 11 genes that were upregulated and 21 genes that were downregulated in the IFN-treated patients, according to these criteria. Upregulated genes included interleukin 8 (IL-8) and defensins alpha 1 and alpha 4. IL-8 is a chemoattractant for neutrophils, induces neutrophil degranulation and enhances defensin release from neutrophils. Defensins are potent antimicrobial peptides that have been shown to exhibit antiviral activity against enveloped viruses and HIV [53, 54] . Downregulated genes included protein-kinase repressor (PRKRIR), which acts to prevent PKR synthesis [55] . Expression for exportin 1 (CRM1) was also downregulated in the PBMC of the IFN-treated SARS patients. CRM1 is a transport receptor that mediates nuclear export of proteins. CRM1 interacts with the Rev protein of HIV [56] , suggestive of a potential for inhibition of nuclear activities associated with viral replication. Additionally, the expression of genes encoding RNA binding proteins and helicases including ELAV1, RNU22, DDX1 and DHX15 was also downregulated, in further support of inhibitory effects on viral replication intermediates. Interestingly, DDX1, a DEAD box protein, has been implicated in facilitating HIV replication [57, 58] .",

Our findings suggest that Jak1, PKCd, and p38 MAPK play important roles in IFN-\u03b1-mediated anti-MHV-1 activity. At the lower doses of IFN-\u03b14, pre-treating the cells with Jak 1 inhibitor completely abrogated the protective effects of IFN-\u03b14. Since Jak1 activation is an early post-receptor activation event, it is not surprising that abrogating this upstream effector in the IFN-receptor signaling cascade has a profound effect on subsequent downstream signaling events and biological responses. By contrast, at the higher doses of IFN-\u03b14, inhibition of PKCd inhibited IFN-induced antiviral activity to a greater extent, implying that STAT1sensitive ISG activation is necessary for IFN-inducible anti-MHV-1 activity. Notably, IFN-\u03b14-induced antiviral activity is unlikely to be exclusively attributable to the activities of Jak1, p38 MAPK, and PKCd.",

We infer from these data that MHV-1 infection per se may prevent the activation of the IFN system. Indeed, many different viruses evade an immune response by interfering with transcriptional activation of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 genes [59] . Notably, in order to escape activation of the IFN system, the SARS-CoV appears to block a step after the early nuclear transport of IRF-3, the transcription factor essential for IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b14 promoter activity [60] .",

            "text": "The pharmacological inhibitors: Jak inhibitor 1, Rottlerin and SB203580 inhibit IFN-inducible anti-MHV-1 activity. (A) 10 6 L2 cells were either left untreated, or treated with the indicated doses of IFN-\u03b14 for 14 h, then challenged with MHV-1 for 36 h. Cells were lysed, RNA extracted and resolved by electrophoresis in agarose and Northern analyses of 28S RNA and cleavage products performed. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. (B) 10 4 L2 cells were either left untreated (\u25b2) or treated with 10\u00b5M Jak inhibitor 1(\u25a0), 1\u00b5M Rottlerin ( ), 10\u00b5M SB203580 (\u25b3), or 100\u00b5M AG490 (O) for 1 h. Cells were then incubated, in triplicate, with the indicated dose of IFN-\u03b14 for 16 h, then challenged with MHV-1. After 24 h CPE were quantitated using a colorimetric assay (Materials and Methods). Data are expressed as percent protection from CPE. Mean values \u00b1 SE of three independent experiments are shown. (C) 10 7 L2 cells were either left untreated, or treated with 10\u00b5M Jak Inhibitor 1, 10 \u00b5M SB203580 or 1\u00b5M Rottlerin for 1 h prior to a 30 min IFN-\u03b14 (10 4 U/ml) treatment. Cells were lysed and equal amounts of whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and examined for Jak1, p38 MAPK or PKCd phosphorylation by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Jak1,-p38 MAPK or -PKCd antibodies. Membranes were stripped and re-probed with anti-Jak1, anti-p38 MAPK, or anti-PKCd antibodies to control for loading. Blots shown are representative of 3 independent experiments. (D) 10 7 L2 cells were either left untreated, or treated with 10 \u00b5M Jak Inhibitor 1 or 1 \u00b5M Rottlerin for 1 h prior to a 30 min IFN-\u03b14 (10 4 U/ml) treatment. Cells were lysed and equal amounts of whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and examined for STAT tyrosine phosphorylation by immunoblotting with antiphospho-STAT antibodies. Membranes were stripped and re-probed with anti-STAT antibodies to control for loading. Blots shown are representative of 3 independent experiments. MHV-1 infection leads to negligible transcriptional activation of 2'5'-oas and pkr. 10 6 L2 cells were either left untreated (UT), infected with MHV-1 (A), treated with 10 4 U/ml IFN-\u03b14 for the times indicated (B), or treated with 10 \u00b5M SB203580, 1 \u00b5MRottlerin or 10\u00b5M Jak 1 inhibitor for 1h then 10 4 U/ml IFN-\u03b14 for 12h (C). RNA was extracted, cDNA synthesized and quantitative real-time PCR analyses performed for reference GAPDH and target genes 2'5'-oas and pkr expression. Data are presented as the fold-change in expression compared to untreated L2 cells. Values \u00b1 SE were calculated using Relative Quantification software (Roche) and are the mean of three separate reactions, each performed in triplicate.",
