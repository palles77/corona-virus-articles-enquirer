Reactivities of recombinant N fusion proteins with post-infection equine sera in immunoblots and ELISAs indicate that the major nucleocapsid protein epitope is located within amino acid residues 1-69. In ELISAs two recombinant nucleocapsid fusion proteins containing residues 1-69 (rN1-69) and 1-28 (rN1-28) discriminated between pre-and post-infection, and pre-and post-vaccination serum samples. Additionally rN1-69 and rN1-28 detected seroconversions following vaccination with a killed virus preparation, even in the absence of a detectable virus neutralising response. Although a good correlation existed between virus neutralising antibody and rN1-69 ELISA positive values in post-infection sera, all the rN proteins failed to induce any virus neutralising response in immunised rabbits.",

Diagnosis is complicated because the symptoms of infection are extremely varied and because disease outbreaks may remain clinically unapparent, only coming to light following serosurveys of equine populations. Virus transmission is by both the venereal and respiratory routes, with between 30 and 60% of seropositive stallions permanently shedding equine arteritis virus (EAV) in their semen following infection (Timoney et al., 1986) . Shedding stallions used in breeding have initiated the spread of EVA to mares which, once infected, shed virus in most body fluids during the viraemic phase (McCollum et al., 1961) and may infect in-contacts by the respiratory route.",

Should G L prove useful as a subunit vaccine antigen, a serodiagnostic test based on an alternative virus antigen could allow differential discrimination of subunit vaccinated from other seropositive horses. This would aid the identification of naturally infected seropositive animals, in particular stallions likely to be shedding EAV in their semen, and could consequently reduce the risk of virus transmission by the venereal route.",

These constructs contain the amino terminus of N, the loss of which in rN70-89 and rN90-110 produces unreactive proteins in both immunoblots and ELISAs. The poor reactivity of rNl-ll0 in ELISA could be due to improper folding of the N protein within this construct, as VN sera recognised it fairly strongly in immunoblots. The complete failure of rN1-28 to react with VN sera in immunoblots, and very poorly in ELISA, may be due, at least in part, to a linear epitope spanning through and beyond amino acid residue 28. In both ELISA and immunoblots the most reactive protein was rN1-69 and although more exhaustive testing is required, these results indicate that the immunoreactive epitope of N is contained within amino acids 1-69 and that the region spanning residue 28 is important for reactivity with equine sera.",

These ELISA antigens confirmed the presence of EAV-specific antibodies in all the control VN +, post-infection VN + and EAV-specific equine sera tested and were capable of identifying vaccine induced seroconversion in the absence of a detectable VN antibody response. Additionally, rN1-69 ELISAs on sera with conflicting VN and rG L ELISA confirmed 4/7 rG L ELISA + results correctly. One feature of both the rG L and rN ELISAs is their ability to detect ELISA + VNsamples, both post-vaccination and from amongst field samples submitted for diagnosis. This appears due to an increased sensitivity of the ELISAs over the VN test, which detects the sub-population of antibodies neutralising EAV from the total pool of equine antibodies reactive to viral proteins. At the current time the rGL55-98 and rN1-69 ELISAs appear suitable for pre-screening samples prior to performing a confirmatory VN test on ELISA + samples. This could immediately accelerate both the clearing of horses with an EAV-, and reporting of horses with an EAV +, antibody status. Only more widespread use of these antigens in ELISA will confirm their suitability as stand-alone diagnostic reagents, or as replacements for the VN test.",
