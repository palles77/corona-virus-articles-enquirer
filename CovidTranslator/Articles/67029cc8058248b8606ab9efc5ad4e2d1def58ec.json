Questionnaires were distributed to midwives between March and November 1998. However, they were received primarily by women who gave birth in the spring and autumn months of the same year, as midwives were often on vacation during the summer months. The authors argued that there was no possibility of selection bias (where errors are present in the selection of study participants and may skew trial data). The study found no significant effect on birth weight following pre-natal consumption of glycyrrhiza. However, it was noted instead that heavy glycyrrhiza use correlated strongly with lower gestational ages. When gestational age of 38 weeks was considered as a cut-off point, odds ratio for preterm delivery associated with heavy glycyrrhiza intake was 2.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.1-5.5, p = 0.03).",

Consequently, in a subsequent study published in 2002 (Strandberg et al., 2002) by the same authors, the effect of glycyrrhiza on pregnant women was examined. This study involved a sample of 95 Finnish women who delivered preterm births and were then compared with women who delivered babies of normal gestational age in the same hospital. To establish glycyrrhizin intake, questionnaires were issued to each of the women to ascertain their liquorice consumption. Glycyrrhizin consumption was graded in three strata: low (<250 mg/week), moderate (250-499 mg/week), and heavy (\u2265500 mg/week). The results showed that heavy consumption versus a lower level of consumption was associated with, in excess of a twofold increased risk of preterm (<37 weeks) delivery, with a borderline significance. The association was more apparent in the fully adjusted model when only the 40 births classified as early preterm delivery (<34 weeks) were included (odds ratio = 3.07, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-8.05). As a result of these studies, WHM recommends caution if prescribing glycyrrhiza to pregnant women.",

As illustrated by the trial flow in Fig. 2 , this study exhibited several issues. First, because data on liquorice consumption was collected through the use of a retrospective postnatal questionnaire, the actual amount of liquorice consumed by a subject may be different to that reported. Second, in a case-control study, statistical analysis is conventionally based on the 'odds ratio'. The odds ratio is defined as the ratio of odds in the case group (i.e. the proportion of people given exposure divided by that of people not given exposure) to the corresponding odds in the control group (Fig. 3) . In this study, the odds ratio is 2.18 (95% confidence interval: 0.98-4.86, p = 0.056), thus termed as insignificant. Similar issues with this study have been reported by Slattery and Morrison, where they called for further assessment of the role of liquorice in preterm births (Slattery and Morrison, 2003) .",

Obviously, if the result reported by a Korean team is in fact correct, then it is very important that clinicians are increasingly cautious in the prescription of glycyrrhiza to pregnant women. Indeed the results of this study attracted a notable level of media attention when publicized in Korea. 2 This trial was a prospective cohort study involving pregnant women who, upon having their pregnancy confirmed, were asked to enrol in the trial. Based upon whether the women took herbal medication or not, they were then split into two groups, an experiment group and a control group. As a result, 185 pregnant women who took herbal medication including glycyrrhiza were compared with 370 age-matched pregnant women who were not exposed to herbal medications. According to this trial, all foetal outcomes assessed at delivery were similar between the groups, except a rate of stillbirths. The rate of stillbirths was significantly higher in women who took glycyrrhiza than in those who did not (p = 0.048).",

Once a subject's pregnancy had been confirmed by a medical doctor, she was then asked to complete a questionnaire where she provided information regarding her ingestion of herbal medicines. As a result of their answer to these questions, women were assigned to either a control group or the experiment group. This data collection method provides an opportunity for significant errors to appear in the study. The errors that may arise in such a situation are called 'memory bias', where a subject may, for a number of reasons, alter the content of what they recall remembering.

Maternal infection might lead to systemic illness in the mother and thus cause the foetus to die because of high maternal fever, respiratory distress or other systemic reactions.

There was no protocol prescription given to each woman in the experiment group, rather it was reported that women in the experiment group took a commercially available substance or a prescribed herbal medicine. It should be understood that, in Korea, patients do not generally know the ingredients contained in their prescription because Korean medicine doctors often modify original herbal medications according to their examination. Additionally, there are many Korean medicine doctors who prescribe herbal medications based on the principles of 'Four-Constitution' medicine. These principles represent a branch of traditional Korean medicine in which patients are assumed to consist of four types (i.e. greater yang, lesser yang, greater yin, and lesser yin person). According to these principles, glycyrrhiza can be prescribed to only 'lesser yin' patients, although the majority of Korean people are known to be 'greater yin' in nature. Hence, not all women in the experiment group might have taken herbal medicine that included glycyrrhiza.",

To explain further, this study determined significance by calculating the 'odds ratio'. There were four stillbirths amongst 180 women in the experiment group and one stillbirth amongst 350 women in the control group. The study therefore reported the odds ratio to be 7.9 (95% confidence interval: 0.9-71.5), with p = 0.048. However, on closer analysis, the result should be insignificant because the 95% confidence interval includes value one. If one alternatively calculates the odds ratio using two commonly employed statistical programs, 4 it is revealed that whereas the point estimate and its 95% confidence interval were the same with the original study, p value in this instance was 0.065, thus indicating that there was no statistical difference between two groups.",
