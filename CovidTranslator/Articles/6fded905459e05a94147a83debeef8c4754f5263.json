Emergency events may be externally triggered (e.g., natural disasters; outbreaks of new, deadly diseases; or vicious acts of terrorism) that result in a massive demand on a healthcare system. 3 See, e.g., Joint Comm'n on Accreditation of Healthcare Orgs., Hospital Accreditation Standards (HAS) Standards EC4.10, EC4.20 (2004) (providing a detailed checklist of required activities and requiring a hospital to conduct drills regularly to test emergency management). Cf. National Fire Protection Ass'n, Standard 1600 on Disaster/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs \u00a7 \u00a7 1 1 1 2 (2004) (establishing a standard common set of criteria for assessing and implementing emergency and disaster management), available at www.nfpa.org/PDF/nfpa1600.pdf (last visited Sept. 13, 2004) . 4 See North Carolina Hosp. Ass'n, Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (1992) (discussing both the Incident Command System and Hospital Emergency Incident Command System disaster response plans). 5 Emergencies also may be entirely institutionbased (e.g., a small fire in the data center, a burst pipe in the emergency department, or a hospital-wide labor strike). Regardless of whether emergencies are external or internal to the organization, such events may impair healthcare operations and thereby trigger the implementation of a hospital's emergency management plan and its Incident Command Structure (ICS) or Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (HEICS) 4 response.",

The flooding water overwhelmed precautions that had been designed to withstand a 100-year flood; destroyed a pathology laboratory; dispersed medical waste and biohazards; submerged mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems; damaged communication systems; and required the complete evacuation of the Memorial Hermann Hospital and the Memorial Hermann Children's Hospital. 5 And, of course, all Americans remember the heroism and professionalism exhibited by healthcare workers in the hours and days after the terrorist attacks in New York, NY, and Washington, D.C., on September 11, 2001. Or consider the example of the North York General Hospital in Toronto, Canada, which experienced a different emergency situation during May and August of 2003, when an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) occurred in its orthopedic unit. 6 The hospital ultimately had ninety SARS patients, forty-four of them from the hospital's staff. North York General closed its doors to any new patients, and had to find ways to treat those patients who already had or who developed SARS. Hospital staff assumed significant personal risk to treat a new type of disease that affected their friends and colleagues. They did so under extraordinarily difficult circumstances that included a workplace quarantine and the intense scrutiny of a frightened media and populace. 7 Remember also that, in the summer of 2003, large portions of New England and the mid-Atlantic states suffered power outages as a result of a falling tree limb cutting power lines in Ohio. Community members flocked to hospitals across the region for shelter even as the hospitals were operating on emergency-generator power, canceling elective procedures, and frequently functioning with compromised computer and other systems. As recently as late summer of 2004, four hurricanes devastated the state of Florida, causing the evacuation of local hospitals.",

To further this goal, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Public Health Law Program has developed the Community Public Health Legal Preparedness Initiative (Initiative). 11 Through intensive, community-based, one-day workshops, this Initiative aims to build vibrant and enduring partnerships between legal counsel for private and public hospitals, as well as with other healthcare organizations and public health agencies, to enhance the use of law as a tool to advance community health through prevention and health promotion.

            "text": "In addition to their role as providers of healthcare services, healthcare institutions also are employers. In this context, healthcare institutions must comply with myriad state and federal laws. In the event of an emergency, institutional personnel of all varieties will be called upon to perform various functions, both within and outside of their typical scope of duties. Preparing for and dealing with the aftermath of a crisis will involve an array of duties not only to the public and individual patients, but to the institution's employees as well. Although the laws and regulations discussed in this section apply specifically to the employment relationship between healthcare institutions and their employees, it is important to note that some providers and other personnel work as independent contractors rather than as employees. Institutions should consider the effects of independent-contractor status with respect to the ability to use certain personnel in the event of an emergency, particularly if such individuals have relationships with more than one institution. Moreover, public-sector healthcare institutions also must bear in mind liability issues that might arise under various civil-rights statutes. 25 1. General Considerations. In developing an emergency management plan, organizations should consider the following personnelrelated issues. a. Have the institution's employees received materials and training on the development of personal emergency plans for themselves and their families? Do employees' families understand that, in an emergency, their personal emergency plans may need to be initiated without the employees (or with them only calling into a designated contact), as they may be required to stay at the facility and assist in the facility's response? Do they have enough information about family emergency plans to feel confident that their family will be safe during the emergency so they can focus on their responsibilities? b. Has the institution identified multiple safe staging areas for groups of employees, outside of the primary emergency-response areas, so that they can be assigned as needed? Have the locations of the staging areas been communicated to employees? c. Does the institution have a mechanism that ensures that employees are only released to return home if they are not needed, and if the institution believes that the employee may safely leave the premises? Has the institution developed mechanisms that will enable it to learn of unsafe conditions that would interfere with employees and others 25 See generally 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2004) . exiting the institution (e.g., closed roads, bridges, and mass-transit problems)? d. Has the institution made provision for emergency emotional, spiritual, psychological, and potentially psychiatric support to its employees who are dealing with the personal effects of the emergency? Does it have a plan to employ a triage or other mechanism in such a situation? e. Has the institution anticipated providing some long-term, post-response support to its employees in the event of a major disaster? Does it have the internal resources to do so, or would it need to go to another organization or agency? If it needs to go elsewhere, does it know where to go? f. If an independent contractor has any of its employees performing responsibilities onsite at the institution, has that contractor set up a mechanism to locate and safeguard its employees? Do such employees have a central place to gather and sign in? g. Does the institution know who the independent-contractor employees are, and where they would gather in an emergency in case it needs to call upon their expertise (e.g., a contractor providing routine onsite staffing and management for an institution's data center)? Does the institution know who to contact at the independent contractor's office to get those individuals resourced appropriately in an emergency? h. e. Does a \"no-fault\" compensation program apply? f. Has the organization identified the availability of workers' compensation and/or other forms of financial support for persons unable to return to work because of an isolation/quarantine order? g.

For example, some states have enacted measures banning mandatory overtime for nurses and other healthcare professionals. 27 Meeting these obligations could present a significant challenge in the face of a major public health emergency, involving a redefinition of the work day, work week, and/or overtime. Some states are considering mandating the continuation of wages if employees are kept from work due to isolation or quarantine (policies that might be considered akin to jury duty). Such measures might enhance compliance by reducing individuals' fears of lost income, and also afford protection for the rest of the workforce. a. Would discharging an employee who is absent because she is subject to quarantine be deemed illegal as a public-policy violation? b. What is the outcome if extended hours required of healthcare workers run up against legal limits on the hours that physicians and nurses can work consecutively? c. Will payment be provided for temporary lodging, meals, or other incidental expenses? d. How will payroll and benefits be maintained? 4. Credentialing Issues, Including Disaster Privileges. Issues may arise regarding whether a hospital or healthcare entity may allow outside medical personnel to assist regular staff during an emergency due to existing medicalprivileges requirements. JCAHO requires hospitals to establish a procedure for verifying credentials and granting privileges during and after a disaster, 28 and has established procedures for doing so. In addition, at the federal level, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services is required to establish a system for advance registration of health professionals to provide for verification of credentials, licenses, accreditations, and hospital privileges when such professionals volunteer during a public health emergency. 29 a. Has the appropriate state or local jurisdiction adopted regulations regarding the use of disaster privileges during an emergency situation? Do such regulations provide immunity for granting or denying such disaster privileges, or for providing care after being granted such privileges? Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes; and no party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or gross recklessness. ",

The statute itself contains no suggestion that its obligations would vary in the face of a community-wide emergency; nevertheless, when such events began to seem more likely, concerns and questions arose. 62 Although it reiterated to some extent the continued application of EMTALA's obligations, the 2001 CMS letter suggested that there was an exception to the stabilization requirement if a community response plan is in place. 63 Moreover, the letter indicated that a hospital's initial screening obligation might be limited if a community-response plan designated certain facilities to handle particular categories of patients in a bioterrorism situation, and if the hospital in question is not such a designated facility. 64 The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 65 articulated a more formal policy regarding EMTALA obligations in an emergency situation. The legislation authorized the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to waive sanctions for EMTALA violations when the violations when the violation comes from an inappropriate transfer of an unstable patient in public health emergency circumstances (as defined by a presidential declaration). This potential limitation on EMTALA obligations during a public health emergency is more circumscribed than what the 2001 CMS letter suggested, as it does not indicate a reduction in the screening obligation (nor does it eliminate private individuals' right of action).",

Similar to the 2001 CMS letter and the 2002 Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act, this final rule did not answer definitely the question regarding the extent of EMTALA obligations in a crisis situation. The preamble to the rule references the 2001 CMS letter, and notes that the final rule adds a public health emergency provision to the EMTALA regulations. 67 The new provision states that \"sanctions under EMTALA for an inappropriate transfer during a national emergency do not apply to a hospital with a dedicated emergency department located in an emergency area . In the event of such an emergency, CMS would issue appropriate guidance to hospitals.\" 68 CMS Interpretive Guidelines issued to State Survey Agency Directors on May 13, 2004, 69 seemed to restate the position taken in the 2001 CMS letter. Referencing the new regulatory provision implemented with the 2003 final rule, 70 the guidelines state that, in the event of a national emergency or crisis, if state or local governments have implemented communityresponse plans designating certain facilities to handle particular categories of patients, then hospitals in the area that are not designated facilities must still provide a medical screening exam, but may then transfer patients in those categories to a designated facility without triggering EMTALA sanctions. 71 The Project Bioshield Act of 2004, signed into law on July 21 of that year, contains a brief provision relating to EMTALA's screening obligations, allowing the DHHS Secretary to waive standard EMTALA requirements, and allow for \"the direction or relocation of an individual to receive medical screening in an alternate location pursuant to an appropriate State emergency preparedness plan.\" 72 two main sources of protection for the institution in the event of a natural disaster.

Reinsurers, who are not regulated by state insurance commissioners, however, are not required to provide reinsurance for terrorism risk, creating a major weakness in the support structure of the insurance industry.In late 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act 73 (TRIA) was enacted. The act's enumerated purposes are \"to address market disruptions, ensure the continued widespread availability and affordability of commercial property and casualty insurance for terrorism risk, and to allow for a transition period for the private markets to stabilize and build capacity while preserving State insurance regulation and consumer protections.\" 74 The Act's \"make available\" provision found in \u00a7 103(c) requires all entities that meet the act's definition of insurer to \"make available\" in their \"property and casualty insurance policies, coverage for insured losses resulting from an act of terrorism.\" 75 This coverage cannot differ materially in form from coverage applicable to losses arising from other events.The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program places the federal government in the role of reinsurer. 76 However, several limitations apply. Under the act, the federal government only reimburses insurers for a portion of their \"insured losses\" 77 resulting from certified \"acts of terrorism.\" 78 The \"act of terrorism\" must meet specific requirements including commission \"by individual(s) on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest, as part of an effort to coerce the U.S. civilian population or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the U.S.\" 79 Thus, acts of domestic terrorism are excluded.",
