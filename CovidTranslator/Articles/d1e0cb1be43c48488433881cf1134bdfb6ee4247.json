            "text": "The lung is constantly exposed to a large volume of inhaled air that may contain toxicant xenobiotics. With the possibility of exposure to a variety of respiratory toxicants from airborne pollutants in our environment during the course of daily activities, in occupational settings, the use of aerosol sprays for household products, and the development of inhalant bronchial therapies, pulmonary toxicology has become an important subspecialty of toxicology. The toxic effects caused by inhalation of gases and particles, ingested chemicals can also have profound effects on the lungs. The pulmonary circulation receives the total cardiac blood output and the lungs are susceptible to injury from blood-borne toxicants since the lungs are capable of metabolizing a variety of xenobiotics and may form metabolites that are more or less toxic than the parent compound (Zhang et al., 2006) . Similar to the upper respiratory tract, toxicity from air-or blood-borne toxicants is dependent on the physiochemical characteristics and concentration of the toxicant, duration of exposure, site/tissue specific sensitivity, and the integrity of defense mechanisms. Although the lung is primarily a means for the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen, the lung also has some important nonrespiratory metabolic functions, such as the regulation of circulating vasoactive amines and prostaglandins (Joseph et al., 2013) . Pathologists need to be cognizant of systemic alterations that can occur secondary to loss of these pulmonary functions.",

            "text": "For toxicologic studies, good gross examination and proper fixation are paramount in the preparation of the lung for histological examination. The usual procedure is intratracheal instillation of formalin fixative (4\u00c06 mL) into the airways followed by ligation of the trachea to maintain the expanded state of the alveoli and immersion in fixative to complete fixation. Instilling an excessive volume of fixative will cause distortion and disruption of alveolar walls, while a less than adequate volume will result in incomplete expansion of the lung. For stereology and morphometric studies, the lung must be fixed under constant pressure-25 cm of water pressure will result in uniform expansion without distortion. The methods for stereology and morphometry are very well defined (Bolender et al., 1993; Weibel et al., 2007) . The pathologist must be aware that intratracheal instillation may carry material from the major airways into the alveoli, and displace lung exudates and inflammatory cells thereby masking subtle inflammatory effects-vascular perfusion of fixative is the method of choice if it is important to maintain the mucous layer or determine the precise location of cells and any particulate matter in the airways. Intratracheal instillation may create artifactual changes such as rupture of alveoli that could be misinterpreted as emphysema, or diffusion of fixative into peribronchiolar and perivascular interstitial tissue that may be misinterpreted as edema (Renne et al., 2001) .",

            "text": "The primordium of the respiratory system develops from a diverticulum of the ventral wall of the primitive foregut with the formation of the tracheobronchial groove (primitive trachea) and two endodermal lung buds which invade the mesoderm and join at the midline to form the primordial lung. The lung buds undergo branching morphogenesis to give rise to the branching tubular primordium of the lung by interacting with the mesoderm (McAteer, 1984; Morse et al., 1979; Yamada et al., 2002) . Around embryonic day 13.5, the right lung bud divides into three primitive bronchi, while the left bud stays undivided and forms a single bronchus (Yamada et al., 2002; McAteer, 1984; Morse et al., 1979) . Commonly described histological stages in mammalian lung development include the following: (1) Pseudoglandular stage (E13\u00c0E18.5) where the epithelial diverticulum from the foregut divide and grow into the surrounding mesenchyme; (2) Canalicular stage (E21\u00c0E22) where differentiation of the epithelium of the future gas exchange region occur along with vascularization and angiogenesis; (3) Saccular stage (E23\u00c0birth) where the aerated appearance of the lung is evident because of the remodeling and differentiation of alveolar epithelial cells; and (4) Alveolar stage (PND B4 to B21) where alveolar formation and maturation occurs (Burri and Moschopulos, 1992; Warburton et al., 2010; Yamada et al., 2002) . Around E17 and E18 the lung is predominantly composed of branching, tubular airways surrounded by mesenchyme. The branching of airways continues on E19 and E20. Around E23 the lung is composed of saccular structures which represent prospective alveolar acini. At birth, the rat lung consists of saccular structures which gradually progresses to mature alveoli by PND 21 (Burri, 1974; Burri and Moschopulos, 1992) .",

The majority of alveoli are formed during the first 3 weeks of life with the outgrowth of secondary septa that transform the saccules into the alveolar sacs and alveoli.

In the adult rat, the diameter of the trachea is approximately 3 mm horizontally by 1.5\u00c02 mm vertically. The wall is approximately 1 mm thick and is supported by 24 circular cartilages (Hebel and Stromberg, 1976) . Proximal to its bifurcation, the trachea dilates and then divides asymmetrically into left and right primary (extrapulmonary) bronchi. The lung has a single left lobe and four right lobes that follow the bifurcations of the bronchial tree ( Figure 23 .1). Three to 4 mm distally, the right primary bronchus gives rise first to the cranial lobar bronchus, followed by the middle lobar bronchus and the accessory lobar bronchus, and finally terminates as the caudal lobar bronchus. These bronchi conform to the lobes of the right lung, which consist of the anterior (apical or cranial), middle (cardiac), median (azygous or accessory), and posterior (caudal) lobes. The left primary bronchus serves the single large left lobe, and 8 mm distal to the bifurcation, gives rise to a ventral branch and further distally, three dorsolateral, three dorsomedial, and three ventral segmental bronchi arise. Small plates of cartilage support the walls of the extrapulmonary bronchi but are not present in the walls of the intrapulmonary airways.",

In the rat, airway bifurcations generate a major segment at a small angle from the parent airway and a minor segment that arises at a much greater angle. This monopodal asymmetric branching is different from a nearly symmetric dichotomous branching in humans Schlesinger and McFadden, 1981) . The pattern of branching can affect the airflow pattern and particle deposition in the lung (Hofmann et al., 1996; Yeh et al., 1976; Brown, 2015) The number of airway segments from the bifurcation of the trachea to the terminal bronchiole varies from 13 to 20 depending on the lobe (Yeh et al., 1979) . The transition from conducting (bronchioles) to respiratory airways is abrupt, with a short poorly developed respiratory bronchiole giving rise to the pulmonary acinus (Peake and Pinkerton, 2015) . The rat lacks the well-developed respiratory bronchiole that is characteristic of primate lungs including those of humans. The pulmonary acinus, which serves as the gas exchange unit, consists of a branching system of alveolar ducts (approximately six generations in the rat) ending blindly in alveolar sacs (Figure 23 .2). Alveoli evaginate from the alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs. The average diameter of the alveoli is 70.2 6 7.0 mm. The terminal bronchiole, alveolar ducts, and associated alveoli are often referred to as the centriacinar region of the lung.",

The bronchial arteries, considered to be the nutrient artery of the lung, supply the lower half of the trachea, lungs, bronchi, vasa vasorum of pulmonary artery and vein, visceral pleura, and associated lymph nodes. In general, there are two bronchial arteries, left and right, which arise from subclavian artery or its primary branches (Ferreira et al., 2001) . The left and right pulmonary arteries from the pulmonary trunk, deliver blood to the lung for gas exchange and to the pleura. The pulmonary artery gives rise to one axial artery for each lobe, which provides larger branches that follow the airways and smaller branches that do not. Arteries following the airways extend to the level of the alveolar ducts . Bronchial-pulmonary arterial anastomoses occur near the hilum in the rat and rare extrapulmonary anastomoses can occur (Ferreira et al., 2001; McLaughlin, 1983) . The pulmonary venous system drains the pleura, alveoli, bronchioles, and most bronchi. The confluence of veins from the pulmonary lobules form pulmonary veins, one from each lobe, that join to form a single pulmonary vein drain into the left auricle (Nakakuki, 1983; Hosoyamada et al., 2010) . The bronchial veins drain the trachea, esophagus, lungs, bronchi, and associated lymph nodes and enter the superior vena cava.",

Neurosecretory cells are identified ultrastructurally by characteristic electrondense secretory cytoplasmic granules that contain serotonin, calcitonin, bombesin, and encephalin (Adriaensen et al., 2003) . Immunohistochemical staining with Protein G product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), calcitonin gene-related peptide, synaptophysin and synaptic vesicle protein-2 has been used to identify pulmonary neurosecretory cells (Pan et al., 2014 , Adriaensen et al., 2003 . Aggregates of approximately 10\u00c020 of these cells are found at bronchiolar bifurcations and are known as neuroepithelial bodies (NEB) (Gosney and Sissons, 1985) . They are sometimes associated with unmyelinated axons and are thought to function as chemoreceptors. The NEB are sensitive to oxygen tension in the inspired air, and hypoxia will cause degranulation of the cells (Adriaensen et al., 2003; Haworth et al., 2007) .",

Two types of arteries branch from the axial artery to supply each lobe. One type arises at an acute angle and the second type branches at a right angle from the axial artery (Lane et al., 1983) . Morphologically, the two types of vessels differ with respect to their muscular layers. At the hilum of the lung the tunica media of the pulmonary artery consists of a circumferentially arranged layer of smooth muscle bounded by internal and external elastic laminae. Some arteries have an oblique muscle layer external to the external elastic lamina and the circular muscular layer. The oblique muscle layer makes the vessel wall appear unusually thick relative to the diameter of the lumen and has been mistaken for medial hypertrophy. As these arteries decrease in size, the circular muscle layer ends, but the oblique muscle layer continues as a discrete spiral bundle (Figure 23 .5). On cross-section, the vessel may appear to have an irregularly thickened muscle. Eventually the arterial branches become nonmuscular, usually at the level of the alveolar duct. The function of this oblique muscle segment is not known (Meyrick et al., 1978) .",

Current laboratory animal management practices within rodent facilities are such that spontaneous infectious processes should be infrequently encountered.

Clearance of particulate matter from the lung may be dramatically decreased if there is necrosis of ciliated cells in the airways or alterations in the mucous blanket, resulting in the retention of particles in the lung. The rate of cell turnover may be increased, which has the potential to affect the response to a carcinogen. Morphological changes induced by infectious agents may also mask a toxic effect, and thus subtle chemical-related changes may be missed. The pathology caused by few of the more relevant infectious agents that have been associated with pulmonary disease in experimental studies is discussed below.

M. pulmonis infection compromises the immune system and predisposes to secondary respiratory bacterial and viral infections such as CAR bacillus and Sendai virus. The organism has a predilection for the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, middle ear, and the female reproductive tract. Infection may begin in young rats and is usually clinically silent. Clinical signs are primarily observed in older rats and are nonspecific and include rales and dyspnea, snuffle and chattering, ocular and nasal discharges, chromodacryorrhea, rubbing of the eyes, and head tilt (Otto et al., 2015) . Rats with severe middle ear involvement may spin when held up by the tail. Gross lesions of M. pulmonis infection include serous to suppurative inflammation in the upper respiratory tract (nasal cavity, larynx, and trachea), lung, and middle ear (Barthold et al., 2016) . In the lung, there is often atelectasis, bronchiectasis, and abscesses that in adults with end stage disease, lead to the \"cobblestone\" appearance of the lung.

The fungus causes a hostspecific infection presenting as two distinct disease syndromes in immunocompromised and immunocompetent rats. Infection may be fatal in neonates. With exposure to chemicals with immunosuppressive properties, evidence of P. carinii infection may be observed. In immunocompromised rats, P. carinii proliferates uncontrolled in the lung, causing dyspnea, weight loss, and death. Histologically, the organism appears as abundant foamy material and debris filling the alveoli accompanied by interstitial and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. In clinically normal immunocompetent rats, P. carinii causes a self-limiting inflammatory lung disease. Gross pulmonary lesions of P. carinii infection are visible in 50% or more of infected rats 4\u00c05 weeks after infection, and appear as 1\u00c04 mm gray, flat to raised lesions randomly distributed throughout all lungs lobes. These lesions will usually resolve after another 8\u00c012 weeks. Characteristic histologic lung lesions consist of mild to severe multifocal perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages and thickening of the alveolar septa by mild to severe lymphohistiocytic infiltrates (Figure 23 .8). Multinucleated giant cells may sometimes be present. There may be marked Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and interstitial fibrosis in areas of the interstitial infiltrates. After some time, infiltrates in the septa and alveoli are resolved. However, perivascular lymphocyte infiltration persists. Historically, these changes have been attributed to rat respiratory virus (Livingston et al., 2011; Henderson et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2014) . Histologically, silver stains such as Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) can be used to demonstrate the organism within the alveoli. However, fungi cannot be demonstrated in all cases (Livingston et al., 2011) . Diagnosis can be confirmed by performing PCR on lung tissue, and infection detected by serological surveillance and monitoring of immunocompetent animals (Henderson et al., 2012) . Because P. carinii infection causes significant lung inflammation, it can be a confounding factor in inhalation studies, and should be considered when unexpected lymphohistiocytic inflammatory lesions are observed in the lungs of rats.",

Critical to the development of fibrosis is the release of fibrogenic cytokines and fibronectin from pulmonary macrophages activated during the inflammatory response. Fibroblasts migrate into the fibrin casts and produce collagen. Depending on the extent and severity of injury, fibrosis may resolve slowly or may not completely resolve.

In humans, alteration in surfactant production and degradation are considered to be the possible causes, and similar mechanism is considered to be involved in rats experimentally exposed to quartz (Seymour and Presneill, 2002; Bomhard, 2017; Hook, 1991) . At the molecular level, GM-CSF has been shown to play a critical role (Seymour and Presneill, 2002) . Increased surfactant production associated with Type II cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia has been demonstrated in these conditions (Porter et al., 2001; Hook, 1991) . It has also been postulated that the dust accumulates in the alveolar macrophages and interferes with the normal clearance of the surfactant produced by Type II cells. In humans, defective macrophage function is also thought to lead to this condition. Granular eosinophilic proteinaceous concretions associated with inflammation have been seen in the lungs of rats inhaling cobalt sulfate.

The primary pattern of inflammation is usually bronchiolar/alveolar because the epithelium of the terminal bronchioles, alveolar ducts and adjacent alveoli are sites of initial and maximum contact for vapors and aerosols, and/or deposition of particulate agents. Inhalation of mildly toxic vapors or particulates may cause a transient serous, fibrinous, or suppurative exudate with variable numbers of neutrophils.

Cellular injury that occurs from repeated or chronic exposure to toxicants or irritants induces reparative processes in which the damaged tissue may proliferate (hyperplasia) and/or undergo metaplasia to a different, more resistant cell type, if return to normal morphology is not complete. Chronic damage and repair (hyperplasia) may result in genetic alterations/mutations that fuel tumorigenesis. The site of these morphologic changes in the lung is heavily dependent upon the nature of the toxicant and the length of exposure. Proliferative epithelial lesions of the lungs comprise a multistage, morphologic and biologic continuum that consists of focal hyperplasia (that may represent an early stage in the development of neoplasms), adenoma and carcinoma. Because of this continuum, it is sometimes difficult to clearly distinguish between hyperplasia considered preneoplastic and adenomas, or adenomas and carcinomas, and the distinctions may be sometimes arbitrary. In addition, it may also be difficult to separate these neoplasms based on histologic type. In light of such difficulties, by convention, neoplasms originating in the alveolar and/or bronchiolar region of the lung are designated alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas as in the mouse.",

The sequelae to repair of degeneration and necrosis of the epithelium of the bronchi, bronchioles alveolar ducts, and alveoli are generally similar to those described for the upper respiratory tract. Following necrosis of the airway epithelium, the denuded airway surface is re-epithelialized by proliferation of basal cells and/or nonciliated cells at the margins of the lesion. Depending on when the lesion is observed relative to the time of injury, the degree and duration of injury and the relative rates of cell loss and proliferation, one of several different morphological changes is seen. The regenerating epithelium first consists of flattened cells with round to oval nuclei and slightly basophilic cytoplasm (Figure 23.16 ). If the injury is not prolonged, the regenerating cells rapidly become cuboidal and differentiate into ciliated or nonciliated cells. If there is continued injury and cell loss, differentiation does not occur and the epithelium may become pseudostratified or stratified with one to three layers of undifferentiated cells that are irregular in shape. Squamous metaplasia may ensue with differentiation into typical stratified squamous epithelium. If the rate of cell loss diminishes due to metabolic accommodation to the irritant, the regenerating epithelium will differentiate, but the height of the cells will be increased and there may be increased numbers of serous and goblet cells. The hyperplastic epithelium may also be irregular and folded due to crowding of the cells (Figure 23.17) . Regeneration of alveolar epithelium follows a similar pattern. The denuded alveolar basement membrane is first covered by irregular polyhedral cells derived from the proliferating alveolar Type II cells, and the alveolar epithelium becomes simple cuboidal in appearance (Figures 23.18 and 23.19 ). These cells differentiate and become alveolar Type I cells as the injury diminishes. Prolonged low-level injury may result in metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium, which is characterized by replacement of Type I cells with ciliated cells and Club cells (Figure 23 .20). Type II cell hyperplasia is a common response to inhalation of pulmonary toxicants (Miller and Hook, 1990; Schwartz, 1986 ). With inhaled aerosols or particulate matter, the centriacinar region of the lung is most commonly affected. Regenerative hyperplasia of the bronchial or alveolar epithelium is usually accompanied by some degree of inflammation and, if the injury is severe, fibrosis.",

Mesothelial hyperplasia is most commonly observed in inhalation studies with instilled or inhaled particulates and is most severe in the parietal pleura lining the diaphragmatic surface of the lung (Everitt et al., 1994 (Everitt et al., , 1997 .

The neoplastic epithelial cells are relatively uniform with round or oval nuclei and moderately abundant cytoplasm, and some may have apical cytoplasmic vacuoles which probably represent lamellar bodies or lipid droplets (Reznik-Schuller and Reznik, 1982; Ohshima et al., 1985) .

The carcinomas may invade airways (Figures 23.34 and 23.35) , pleura, or vessels and metastasize to regional lymph nodes, liver, kidney, heart, or other organs. Hallmarks of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas are their heterogeneous growth patterns and cellular pleomophism (Figures 23.36 and 23.37) . Morphologic growth patterns vary from glandular, papillary, solid, to a mixture of these patterns. Welldifferentiated carcinomas with a papillary pattern are difficult to distinguish from adenomas. Stratification of the neoplastic epithelium, solid areas of growth, cellular pleomorphism, and atypia or anaplastic cells associated with a scirrhous reaction and local invasion are indications of malignancy (Figures 23.34\u00c023.37) .

In some small neoplasms, the scirrhous reaction may be so pronounced that the neoplasm appears to arise within an area of fibrosis. Neoplastic cells within a carcinoma may be pleomorphic, and particularly anaplastic cells may be spindle shaped (Figure 23 .38). Squamous differentiation is observed in some carcinomas and may be quite prominent (Figure 23.39) . However, the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma is restricted to neoplasms that consist predominantly of squamous cells. Otherwise, neoplasms with squamous differentiation are classified as alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas on the assumption that they are more anaplastic variants of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas. Neoplastic cells may also differentiate into a mucinous cell type; however, such differentiation is rare.

Squamous cell carcinomas efface the normal architecture of the lung and often produce abundant keratin (Figures 23.43 and 23.44) , however there is variability in keratin production between neoplasms. They are highly invasive extending into the contiguous alveolar parenchyma, may induce a marked necrosis and/or scirrhous response, and may metastasize.

These neoplasms are considered to arise from areas of squamous metaplasia in the alveolar epithelium and Club cells, or focal squamous cysts. CKE are discretely irregular, small to expansive cystic lesions that are sharply demarcated from the surrounding alveolar parenchyma (Figures 23.45 and 23.46) . Compression of the adjacent lung parenchyma is usually not observed except in association with larger neoplasms, as growth seems to occur by extension along contiguous alveolar septae from the periphery of the wall. The neoplasm consists of a central, cystic cavity filled with laminated keratin and keratin whorls (pearls), surrounded by a complex wall of squamous epithelium that shows no atypia, dysplasia (abnormal or disorderly differentiation), or invasive growth. The squamous wall varies in thickness, consisting of three to several layers of mature, welldifferentiated, squamous epithelium and irregular nests and islands of squamous epithelium that extend along adjacent alveoli resulting in an irregular border. In toxicology/carcinogenicity studies in which increased incidences of CKE occur, the extrapolation and relevance of this finding to human health is incompletely understood since CKE do not occur in the human lung.

However, inhaled gases may react chemically with the components of the mucous layer overlying the airway epithelium, thus limiting diffusion or detoxifying the gas. Highly reactive chemicals such as anhydrous acids or strong oxidants can react directly with the lining epithelium of the airways or alveoli and cause necrosis.

These gases include common urban pollutants such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide. The particular sensitivity of the terminal bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and proximal alveoli may be related to the decreased thickness of the mucous blanket in this area and not to a unique sensitivity of these cells to toxic agents. With mild injury, one of the first changes is focal loss of cilia from the respiratory epithelium and loss of the apical blebs from the Club cells. Higher concentrations lead to concentration-dependent cell necrosis in the terminal bronchioles with compensatory proliferation of Club cells. In the alveoli, the Type I cell is more sensitive to injury than the Type II cell, which may be due to its larger surface area. Compensatory proliferation of Type II cells is seen in most cases of alveolar injury. There is a mild inflammatory reaction with accumulation of alveolar macrophages and an increase in thickness of the blood-air barrier due to collagen deposition in the interstitium with chronic injury. Chronic exposure to nitrogen dioxide has been reported to cause an increase in the number of neuroendocrine cells of the bronchioles.",

Many of the neoplasms induced by asbestos appear to be malignant, even when small, and many also appear to arise in a scar or are associated with a scirrhous reaction.
