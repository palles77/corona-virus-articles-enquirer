            "text": "Clostridium difficile was investigated as a possible cause of enteritis in calves. The organism and its toxins (TcdA and TcdB), respectively, were found in 25.3% and 22.9% of stool samples from diarrheic calves. Culture positive samples were more likely than culture negative samples to be toxin positive. However, toxin positive stools were more common among nondiarrheic calves, but diarrheic calves were nearly twice as likely to be culture positive. Ribotype 078 was dominant among isolates. Salmonella sp. was isolated from both diarrheic and nondiarrheic calves, but large numbers of E. coli were found more commonly in diarrheic calves than in nondiarrheic animals. Prevalence rates for coronavirus and Cryptosporidium sp. were substantially higher in nondiarrheic calves than in diarrheic, but rates of detection of rotavirus and Giardia sp. were more nearly equal between groups. Lesions in naturally infected calves included superficial mucosal erosion with associated fibrinous exudates. Neutrophils and eosinophils infiltrated lamina propria. Large Gram-positive rods morphologically compatible with C. difficile were abundant in the colonic lumen and the organism was isolated by bacteriologic culture. Toxins were found throughout the colon. Purified toxins A and B (individually and conjointly) caused comparable lesions, as well as fluid accumulation, in ligated intestinal loops. Our findings are in substantial agreement with those of others [MO, U.S.A.] and add strength to a working hypothesis that C. difficile infection and the accompanying intoxication can manifest as diarrhea in calves. It seems clear that calves serve as multiplying hosts for this organism. #",

A., 1996) , and, in 2002, we initiated work to determine the role of C. difficile in bovine neonatal diarrhea. Our findings revealed C. difficile toxins in more than 25% of calves, and nearly 40% of these were strongly positive. Incidence peaked at 1-2 weeks of age (Porter et al., 2002) . Rodriguez-Palacios et al. (2006) obtained isolates of C. difficile from stools of 11.2% of 144 diarrheic (7.6%) and 134 nondiarrheic (14.9) calves. Seven of the eight PCR ribotypes isolated have been found in humans with CDAD, and two (017 and 027) have caused severe human disease. Toxins were detected in feces from 39.6% of diarrheic calves and 20.9% of controls. In both cases, differences were statistically significant ( p 0.0009). These results (Porter et al., 2002; Rodriguez-Palacios et al., 2006) suggested an association of C. difficile with calf diarrhea, and a possible bovine reservoir of infection for humans. Results of the present work strengthen the view that this organism may be associated with calfhood diarrheas.",

Prior to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, isolates were subcultured twice on prereduced Brucella agar supplemented with bovine blood (5%), and hemin and vitamin K, as above. Colonies were suspended in trypticase soy broth to an optical density equivalent to that of a McFarland 0.5 standard. Plates were inoculated with a modified Steer's replicator (1-2 mL per spot) and incubated for 48 h at 37 8C in an atmosphere of 5% H 2 :5% CO 2 :90% N 2 . The lowest dilution of antimicrobial that affected growth on the test plate (as compared to control plates containing no antimicrobial) constituted the MIC. MIC 50 and MIC 90 were the concentrations at which 50% and 90%, respectively, of strains were inhibited. Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285, Eggerthella lenta ATCC 43055, C. difficile ATCC 9689, and Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124 were used as quality control organisms.",

These data on co-infecting agents are limited, and are perhaps best viewed as providing a basis for hypotheses on which to plan future experimental work. A limited number of specimens (n = 60; 23 from diarrheic calves, 37 from nondiarrheic calves) were examined for presence of coronavirus, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium sp., and Giardia sp. Prevalence rates for coronavirus and Cryptosporidium sp. were substantially higher in nondiarrheic calves than in diarrheic (Table 4 ; p = 0.001), but differences in rates of rotavirus and Giardia sp. detection were not significant. The impact of these figures is lessened by the small number of observations in some cells (e.g., Giardia sp.). Among stools from nondiarrheic calves, those testing positive for toxins were most likely to contain the viral and protozoal pathogens (data not shown). Only two toxin positive samples from diarrheic calves tested positive for any of these four pathogens (one for Crytptosporidium sp. and one for Giardia sp.) and only five toxin negative samples from diarrheic calves tested positive (one for coronavirus and rotavirus, two for Cryptosporidium sp., and one for Giardia sp.). C. difficile culture positive specimens also containing these additional pathogens were rare (four from nondiarrheic calves, none from diarrheic).

Our results are somewhat different than those in a case: control study (Rodriguez-Palacios et al., 2006) which suggested that frequent demonstration of Cryptosporidium sp. in diarrheic calves did not confound a conclusion that C. difficile caused the diarrhea.

However, these data are limited in scope and support no firm conclusions, but suggest both the need and a direction for further study. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antimicrobials for calf isolates were somewhat lower than those for swine isolates (Table 5 ; Post and Songer, 2004) . MICs for control strains were within limits prescribed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (Benning and Mathers, 1999; National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, 2001) . Others have reported in vitro anticlostridial activity of tylosin (Dutta et al., 1983) , and our findings concur; MICs 50 for erythromycin, tilmicosin, and tylosin were relatively low (0.25-0.50 mg/mL). Lack of bimodal distribution of susceptibility to erythromycin and tylosin suggests that erythromycin resistance elements encountered in strains from other species (Dzink and Bartlett, 1980; Delmee and Avesani, 1988; Farrow et al., 2001; Post and Songer, 2004) may be rare in this population. Human strains vary widely in susceptibility to tetracycline (Dzink and Bartlett, 1980; Delmee and Avesani, 1988) , but with the exception of a single outlier (susceptible at 0.125 mg/mL), these calf strains were susceptible only at 8-16 mg/mL. The low MIC 90 for virginiamycin (0.125 mg/mL) suggests that these strains may be susceptible in vivo, in contrast to strains from pigs, for which the MIC 90 was 16 mg/mL (Post and Songer, 2004) . Bacitracin had little activity against calf strains (MIC 90 64 mg/mL), in keeping with results for human, porcine, and equine strains (Jang et al., 1997; Citron et al., 2001; Post and Songer, 2004) . High MICs reported for cephalosporins (Dzink and Bartlett, 1980; Chow et al., 1985; Post and Songer, 2004 ) mirror our results for ceftiofur (MIC 90 128 mg/mL). Positive clinical outcomes seem unlikely for agents with an MIC higher than recommended doses.",

Inoculation of a duodenal loop with TcdA led to luminal accumulation of neutrophils, and fibrin associated with moderate numbers of sloughed, necrotic epithelial cells; hemorrhage and edema occurred in the lamina propria. Superficial mucosal erosions and neutrophil infiltration occurred in the jejunal, ileal, and colonic mucosa. Mucus, fibrin, neutrophils, and sloughed epithelial cells accumulated in the lumen of a loop in mid-spiral colon (Table 6) . Lesions in loops inoculated with TcdB were somewhat more severe, and included multifocal, ulcerative enteritis in the duodenum and the jejunum, marked villous necrosis in the ileum, and neutrophil infiltration into the small intestinal mucosa. Epithelium in a loop in upper spiral colon was hemorrhagic and necrotic, and neutrophils and lymphocytes infiltrated lacteals. The mid-colonic loop was hemorrhagic; deep ulceration extended to the muscularis mucosa, with mild infiltration by and exudation of neutrophils near ulcers (Table 6) . Mucosal lesions in loops exposed to both toxins were similar to those observed with individual toxins, but severe villous necrosis occurred in the duodenum and the ileum. Peyer's patch-associated lacteals in the jejunum were distended and contained lymphocytes; fewer neutrophils were noted than with individual toxins. Ileal mucosa was edematous, and inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, were found in the lamina propria. The loop in the upper spiral colon had deep mucosal erosions with hemorrhage and accumulation of mucus and cellular debris. The mucosal surface in the mid-colonic loop was necrotic, with vacuolation and some loss of supporting lamina propria.
