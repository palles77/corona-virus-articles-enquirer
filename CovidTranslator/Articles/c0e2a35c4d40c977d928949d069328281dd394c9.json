We previously demonstrated that deletions in different regions of the 5 UTR significantly reduced viral RNA translation and infectivity. Such observations suggested strongly that viral RNA translation and replication could be blocked if highly specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) were applied to target crucial sites within the 5 and 3 UTRs. In this study, seven phosphorothioate AS-ODNs were synthesized, and the antiviral activity was evaluated by Lipofectin transfection of HeLa cells with AS-ODNs followed by infection of CVB3. Analysis by Western blotting, reverse transcription-PCR, and viral plaque assay demonstrated that viral protein synthesis, genome replication, and infectivity of CVB3 were strongly inhibited by the AS-ODNs complementary to different regions of the 5 and 3 UTRs. The most effective sites are located at the proximate terminus of the 5 UTR (AS-1), the proximate terminus of the 3 UTR (AS-7), the core sequence of the internal ribosome entry site (AS-2), and the translation initiation codon region (AS-4). These AS-ODNs showed highly sequence-specific and dose-dependent inhibitory effects on both viral protein synthesis and RNA replication. It is noteworthy that the highest inhibitory activities were obtained with AS-1 and AS-7 targeting the termini of the 5 and 3 UTRs. The percent inhibition values of AS-1 and AS-7 for CVB3 protein VP1 synthesis and RNA replication were 70.6 and 79.6 for AS-1 and 73.7 and 79.7 for AS-7, respectively. These data suggest that CVB3 infectivity can be inhibited effectively by AS-ODNs.",

Like other picornaviruses, the 5\u0408 untranslated region (UTR) of the CVB3 genome is unusually long (741 nucleotides [nt]) but, unlike eukaryotic mRNAs, is not capped with a 7-methylguanosine triphosphate group. Instead, it is covalently linked to a virusencoded oligopeptide (VPg) (31) . The viral genome is approximately 7.4 kb long with a polyadenyl tail at the 3\u0408 end. The primary sequence of the genomic RNA serves as mRNA to direct synthesis of viral proteins using host protein translational machinery. Picornavirus RNA encodes a single long polyprotein, which is processed initially into three precursor polyproteins (P1, P2, and P3). Further processing of these precursors by three virus-encoded proteases, 2A, 3C, and 3CD, gives rise to mature structural and nonstructural proteins in-cluding four capsid proteins and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase essential for viral replication (27) .",

            "text": "It has long been known that the majority of cellular mRNAs in eukaryotic organisms initiate translation via a cap-dependent ribosomal scanning mechanism (18, 26) . However, the initiation of protein translation in picornaviruses occurs by an unusual mechanism involving direct internal binding of the ribosome to a sequence element of the 5\u0408 UTR of viral RNA (20) , termed an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) (9, 21, 22) . The IRES directs binding of the small ribosomal subunit to viral RNA near the 3\u0408 border of the IRES, independent of a cap structure at the 5\u0408 terminus of the RNA. Recently, our work has confirmed the presence of an IRES within the 5\u0408 UTR of CVB3 RNA by mutational analysis using both bicistronic plasmids and full-length CVB3 mutants (33, 54) . Further mapping of various mutations demonstrated that the crucial sequence of the IRES of CVB3 is located roughly at stem-loops G, H, and I, spanning nt 439 to 639. This critical sequence was further analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis and demonstrated that the critical nucleotides of the IRES span the pyrimidine-rich tract between stem-loops G and H. A 46-nt deletion in this region abolished viral translation and infectivity (33) . Therefore, the IRES plays an important role in the translation initiation of viral proteins. In addition, our recent work also found that the 5\u0408 proximate terminus of 5\u0408 UTR is critical for translation initiation of CVB3. Deletion of nt 1 to 63 of 5\u0408 UTR greatly inhibited CVB3 translation (54) . Similar findings have been reported in other picornaviruses, suggesting that the 5\u0408 cloverleaf structure of the 5\u0408 UTR may be responsible for viral replication (16, 53) . In addition, recent reports have suggested that the 3\u0408 UTRs of several picornaviruses are involved in viral RNA replication (35, 37, 41) . Thus, by blocking crucial sites within the 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 UTRs of CVB3 through sequence-specific hybridization, viral protein translation and RNA replication will be inhibited.",

Recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first AS-based therapeutic product for the treatment of retinitis caused by cytomegalovirus infections in patients with AIDS (11) . Although viral replication could be inhibited by unmodified oligonucleotides, their vulnerability to nuclease attack, combined with their intracellular distribution and uptake properties, have limited their therapeutic potential (4, 24) . To avoid this problem and to improve the cellular uptake of oligonucleotides, phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) encapsulated in liposomes were used in this study. Because the mode of AS action is highly specific, it is essential to carefully select appropriate viral target sequences. Based on our previous mutational mapping and other reports on CVB3 and other picornaviruses (15, 33, 35, 37, 50, 54) . The 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 UTRs of CVB3 RNA were chosen as the major targets for designing As ODNs. In this report, seven AS-ODNs were synthesized and evaluated in HeLa cells infected with CVB3. Four of the seven showed specific and dose-dependent inhibition of CVB3 gene expression. Two of the four targeting the 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 proximate termini of CVB3 genomic RNA demonstrated the strongest antiviral activity.",

The ODNs located at the 3\u0408 UTR were designed according to the tertiary structure of the 3\u0408 UTR of CVB3 RNA (35, 50) . These three ODNs targeting the 3\u0408 UTR were designed to disrupt the kissing interaction of two predominant hairpin loops. To avoid using too many control oligomers in the first round of the evaluation, an ODN (AS-S) with the same length and an average GC content but with a random sequence was designed as a general control of all seven ODNs. After the highest inhibitory activities were obtained with AS-1 and AS-7, these two AS-ODNs were chosen for further evaluation of their specificity using two new controls for each, which were designed with scrambled and reverse sequences, respectively. The controls were analyzed with DNA Strider software to avoid any sequence complementation with CVB3 genomic RNA.",

            "text": "To establish an optimal in vitro evaluation system using HeLa cells, three parameters were tested. The first was cell confluency. The optimal cell confluency for transfection should usually be 30 to 50%. However, at this cell confluency, it is hard to determine the effects of AS-ODNs on viral multiplication because most trans-fected cells died quickly after only 12 h with CVB3 infection. This observation was attributed to the high transfection efficiency leading to nonspecific toxicity to the cells, especially at a high oligonucleotide concentration. Through a series of experiments, we found that the optimal cell confluency for AS-ODN transfection followed by CVB3 infection is 85%, even though the transfection efficiency would be somewhat affected. The second consideration was the MOI. Unlike some viruses, FIG. 1. Targets of the AS-ODNs within the proposed secondary structures of the 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 UTRs of CVB3 RNA (50, 54) . The 5\u0408 UTR (nt 1 to 741) contains three AS-ODN blocking sites. AS-1 blocks the proximal terminus of the 5\u0408 UTR at nt 1 to 20. AS-2 (nt 557 to 576) and AS-3 (nt 583 to 602) target the IRES region. AS-2 is complementary to the polypyrimidine tract of the IRES core sequence. AS-3 targets the downstream region of the AS-2 near the 3\u0408 boundary of the IRES. AS-4 (nt 733 to 752) blocks the translation initiation codon AUG region including 9 nt of the 5\u0408 UTR. Within the 3\u0408 UTR (nt 7300 to 7399), three AS-ODN targets were selected. AS-5 (nt 7301 to 7320) and AS-6 (nt 7340 to 7359) target stem-loops L and M, respectively. AS-7 (nt 7380 to 7399) blocks the 3\u0408 proximal terminus of the 3\u0408 UTR. The general scrambled oligomer control, AS-S, was synthesized at the same length and random sequence with no annealing target in the CVB3 genomic RNA. Additional oligomer controls for AS-1 and AS-7 are listed with all other oligomers together in Table 1 . CVB3 replicates and assembles very fast in HeLa cells. Therefore, it is important to choose a suitable MOI for CVB3 to evaluate the antiviral effects of AS-ODNs effectively. MOIs of 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 were tested with the AS-ODNs at a final concentration of 10 M. We found that an MOI of 0.01 was the best choice for this experiment because the most meaningful inhibitory effects were obtained under this condition. The third parameter was the dosage of AS-ODNs. ODNs at two different final concentrations (1 and 10 M) were evaluated under the optimal conditions mentioned above. Ten micromolar appeared to be the best dosage for this in vitro evaluation system (see Fig. 2 ). Under these conditions, additional experiments were conducted by transfection of control ODN (AS-S) to determine the toxic effects on HeLa cell growth with the treatment using Lipofectin only as AS-S's negative control.",

Inhibitory effects of AS-ODNs on CVB3 VP1 protein synthesis. To evaluate the effects of AS-ODNs on CVB3 translation, viral structural protein VP1 was detected by Western blotting after transfection. Since CVB3 RNA encodes a single long polyprotein including structural and nonstructural proteins, the synthesis of structural protein VP1 fully represents CVB3 translation efficiency. In order to compare the antiviral action of each AS-ODN with the negative-control oligomer AS-S, the statistically analyzed means and SD were normalized by a value which converted the VP1 mean of control group AS-S to 100. Two different doses of ODNs were used to evaluate their antiviral activities. When a 10 M concentration ODNs was used (Fig. 2) , several oligomers showed potent antiviral activity. Of these oligomers, AS1 and AS7 blocking the termini of 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 UTRs showed the strongest inhibitory effects on VP1 synthesis. Compared with the negative controls (AS-S), the percent inhibition values of CVB3 VP1 synthesis were 84.6, 75.2, 40.6, 56.3, and 88.5 for AS-1, AS-2, AS-3, AS-4, and AS-7, respectively. However, no marked inhibitory activities were observed in groups AS-5 and AS-6. On the contrary, ODN AS-5 slightly stimulated the synthesis of CVB3 VP1, which may be due to experimental variation, since similar results were not obtained from other evaluations of the same ODN.",

To evaluate the effects of AS-ODNs on CVB3 replication, viral genomic RNA was amplified and quantitatively analyzed by RT-PCR and densitometry. We performed PCR with different numbers of cycles and found that 20 cycles was optimal for demonstrating the most significant differences among samples treated with different AS-ODNs. In order to compare the antiviral action of each AS-ODN with the negative-control oligomer, the statistically analyzed means and SD were normalized by a value, which converted the CVB3 cDNA mean of the control group AS-S to 100. Two different doses of AS-ODNs were used to evaluate their antiviral activities. When 10 M ODN was applied (Fig. 5) , the inhibitory trend on CVB3 RNA synthesis was quite similar to that seen for VP1 synthesis. Of the seven oligomers, AS-1 and AS-7 blocking the termini of 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 UTRs, respectively, again showed the strongest antiviral activity. Compared with the control oligomer AS-S, the percentages of inhibition were 88.2, 63.3, 45.5, 59.9, and 87.9 for AS-1, AS-2, AS-3, AS-4, and AS-7, respectively.

By normalizing the data with that of the negative-control AS-S, we found that AS-ODNs AS-1 and AS-7 showed the strongest antiviral activities (78.4 and 77.4%), followed by AS-2 (50.7%) and AS-4 (45%).

            "text": "The most important factor in determining effectiveness and specificity of AS-ODNs is the selection of target sites within CVB3 RNA. The unusually long 5\u0408 UTR of CVB3 RNA forms a highly ordered secondary structure and plays an important role in controlling viral translation, replication, and cardiovirulence (10, 33, 54) . Our recent mutational mapping of the IRES has confirmed that ribosomes initiate translation in CVB3 by binding to the polypyrimidine stretch in the IRES of 5\u0408 UTR and then migrating to the AUG initiation codon (54) . In this situation, AS-ODNs presumably block translation through the inhibition of binding of ribosomes and/or other RNA-binding proteins that are essential in forming the ribosomal complex and in the migration of ribosomal subunits along the mRNA. Therefore, it is possible that the AS-ODN (AS-2) functions in translation arrest by blocking the landing of the ribosome and/or RNA-binding proteins at the IRES (Fig. 1) . In addition, it should be noted that the polypyrimidine tract located be-tween stem-loops G and H (5\u0408UUCAUUUU3\u0408, nt 562 to 569) appears as an open single-stranded structure based on the computer-predicted secondary structure model (54) . This implies that AS-ODN can easily form stable hybridization at this region. From this point of view, it is obvious why this AS-ODN showed such potent inhibitory effects, while another AS-ODN (AS-3) also binding to IRES region did not show the same potency in inhibiting the synthesis of CVB3 VP1. Because the target site of AS-3 is in a hairpin-like secondary structure, it is difficult for AS-3 to form a stable duplex with the viral sequence. Similar situations occurred for AS-5 and AS-6, targeting two hairpin-like structures of 3\u0408 UTR. As for AS-4 covering the translation start codon, the strong inhibitory effect is expected, since AS-ODNs blocking the translation initiation codon should theoretically show a certain degree of inhibitory effect on a mRNA's translation initiation. Similar observations have been reported by other investigators (2, 5, 39, 49) .",

            "text": "Interestingly, two of the AS-ODNs with the strongest inhibitory effects are located at both ends of CVB3 RNA. It is known that the 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 UTRs of the CVB3 RNA form highly ordered tertiary structures serving as recognition features for the RNA-binding domain of host proteins and have important cis-acting functions in the replication and translation of the RNAs (8, 35, 37, 41, 53, 54) . Evidence to date suggests that a cloverleaf structure of poliovirus formed by the 5\u0408-terminal 88 nt of the RNA binds viral proteins 3AB and 3CD and a host protein of 36 kDa (16) . A cellular factor that specifically binds to the 3\u0408 UTR of poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and rhinovirus was detected. Mutations within the 3\u0408 UTR, which decrease the affinity of the RNA for the cellular factor, decrease RNA replication and virus viability (36) . Furthermore, our concurrent UV cross-linking experiments suggest that certain host proteins are able to interact with both the 5\u0408 UTR (nt 1 to 249) and 3\u0408 UTR (nt 7299 to 7399) terminal regions of CVB3 genome (P. K. M. Cheung, C. M. Carthy, L. Bohunek, A. K. Wang, J. E. Wilson, B. M. McManus, and D. C. Yang, unpublished data). The extensive stem-loops and secondary structures within the 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 UTRs are likely the recognition sites of certain common binding proteins connecting both ends of the viral genome (28) (29) (30) . The interaction between the 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 ends of the viral genome via common binding protein(s) has been suggested to play a crucial role in viral replication and possibly in translation initiation (28) (29) (30) 52) . In addition, there has been evidence of the viral 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 UTRs interacting to enhance viral translation and/or transcription (42, 52) ; hence, a closed-loop translation model of mRNA has been proposed (6, 12, 46, 51) . Thus, blocking the terminal region of CVB3 RNA either in the 5\u0408 UTR or 3\u0408 UTR can possibly inhibit binding of cellular proteins which serve as translation or replication initiation factors and in turn, block the formation of a circular replication unit of viral RNA. Such a mechanism may explain why two AS-ODNs (AS-1 and AS-7) blocking termini of CVB3 RNA showed such powerful inhibitory effects. In addition, CVB3 translation and replication may affect each other and thereby result in a negative-feedback effect. When translation is inhibited, the synthesis of structural proteins (such as VP1) and the nonstructural proteins (including RNAdependent RNA polymerase) essential for virus replication is reduced, which will make it difficult for viral RNA transcription and particle assembly to occur. Decreased viral RNA synthesis will in turn reduce translation efficiency. More importantly, some of the AS-ODNs may block not only the landing of translational machinery but also the binding of the protein factors required within viral RNA for gene expression. Therefore, the AS-ODNs can inhibit CVB3 gene expression at both the translational and transcriptional levels.",

However, it still can be argued that the antiviral effects may be due in part to the so-called sequencedependent but nonantisense effect in which sequence-specific interactions between ODNs and cellular proteins occur (7, 45, 47, 48) . Since our AS-ODNs did not produce notable negative effects on HeLa cell growth in the tests of toxicity, this possibility is unlikely. Additionally, several reports indicated the nonsequence-specific effects of ODNs, particularly with the chemically modified molecules. For example, ODNs can bind in a sequence-independent manner the gp120 protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, viral polymerases, RNase H, bovine serum albumin, the receptor for platelet-derived growth factor, and other cellular proteins (7, 13, (43) (44) (45) . Whether this similar event can happen in CVB3 needs to be explored in the future to determine the detailed mechanisms of antiviral action of our AS oligomers.",

This is the first report to demonstrate that translation and replication of CVB3 in tissue culture cells can be specifically inhibited by AS-ODNs. Our observations suggest that these oligomers have great potential for further development as effective, ameliorative therapeutic agents for the control of coxsackievirus-induced heart, pancreas, brain, liver, and muscle diseases.",
