            "text": "in a few infected individuals, the latent viruses are activated under different stress conditions, for instance sunshine, hormonal changes, fever, appearing as cold sore. 1 HsV-1 is the agent of many diseases such as gingivostomatitis, sore throat (pharyngitis), herpetic whitlow, keratoconjunctivitis, herpes encephalitis and meningitis. in immunosuppressed patients, it can be a chronic destructive process. 1-3 both specific and nonspecific defense mechanisms against HsV-1 are important. Host genetic background, macrophages, nK cells, and t-cells and antibodies are important factors in the defense against HsV-1. 1, 2 Macrophage activation can also reduce infection by the virus. 4 Anti-viral drugs including acyclovir, vidarabine, famciclovir, valacyclovir, pencyclovir are widely used in the treatment of HsV-1 infection. 1,2 nowadays, the occurrence of mutations in viral DnA polymerase and thymidine kinase has led to an increase in drug resistance to nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir. 4, 5 to find appropriate alternatives, researchers suggest seeking new chemical and plant sources of therapy for HsV-1 infections. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] considering the role of specific and non-specific host defenses against HsV-1, some therapies can work to strengthen and activate the innate and specific immune system components against HsV-1. 11 coordinating operations of macrophages in anti-herpetic response occur during the first hour of virus invasion. the first defensive line is production and secretion of cytokines such as type i interferon (ifn) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf). subsequently, iL-12 and ifn-\u03b3 are produced, thereby resulting in natural killer cell and macrophage activation. the production of active oxygen radicals (ros) and of no are auxiliary mechanisms to improve anti-viral response. [12] [13] [14] [15] Macrophages have receptors for molecules such as lipopolysaccharide, mannose, and unmethylated cPG repeats of bacteria. 16 signals resulting from the combination of these factors increase the secretion of a wide range of cytokines, which strengthen the innate immune system and activate the specific immune system, especially t cells, against pathogens such as viruses 17, 18 Among them, inf-\u03b3 launches various activities in macrophages, including antimicrobial activity, causing eradication of intracellular pathogens. Macrophage activity is one of the first steps in preventing virus proliferation (HiV, HsV, VZV) in infected cells. Also, antigen processing and presentation to th1 lymphocytes by macrophages induce cellmediated immunity. [15] [16] [17] [18] no induction of the macrophages in an inflammatory response is also an innate immune defense system. 19 no has different tasks such as killing infected cells, tumor cells, and parasitic pathogens. Antiviral effect of no in various viral infections has also been documented. 20 Probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which typically ferment dairy foods in human and animal digestive tracts, can balance the immune system and increase the specific and non-specific immune responses. they are important as immunomodulatory bacteria in the body's defense against pathogens such as viruses (HiV, VZV). 21, 22 Various studies have shown that Lactobacillus rhamnosus (strain GG), a species of probiotic bacteria, has beneficial effects in treating rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants. 23, 24 several studies from in vitro systems, animal models, and humans, suggests that probiotics can enhance both specific and nonspecific immune responses. 25, 26 in a study, it was demonstrated that consumption of lactic acid bacteria in guinea pigs has anti-influenza effects. Also, taking 1 \u00d7 10 9 cfu/mL of lactic acid bacteria decreases genital herpes complications caused by HsV-2. 27 in another study, the effect of probiotic bacteria for prevention and treatment of viral diarrhea caused by rotavirus, astrovirus, calicivirus, enteric adenovirus and coronavirus was reviewed, and the helpful role of probiotic bacteria in limiting viral diarrhea was documented. 26 in an in vitro study, it was demonstrated that probiotic bacteria increase the antiviral response against vesicular stomatitis virus (VsV) by activating macrophages. 11 so, the emergence of antiviral drug resistance observed in HsV-1 makes it necessary to find other alternatives for treating HsV-1 infection. considering the important role of macrophages in eliminating viral infections and the effective role of probiotic bacteria in the removal of viral infections (including HsV), this study aimed to investigate: 1) the direct effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, a probiotic bacterium, on HsV-1; and 2) its effect on macrophage activation for in vitro elimination of HsV-1 infection. in this way, the possible use of probiotics to inhibit HsV-1 infection would be scientifically proven as an alternative treatment.",

            "text": "our results clearly demonstrated that L. rhamnosus exposure enhanced the viability of J774 cell line up to 90%, which is remarkable in comparison to the results reported by ivec et al. (30% viability of VsV infected 3D4/21 cell line). the cause of viability increase can be due to difference of cell line, VsV infectious capacity versus HsV-1, or probiotic species between the two studies. Also, we detected more protective effect of live bacteria than inactive bacteria on the exposure of viral infected macrophages, a finding consistent with ivec et al.'s report. A mechanism involved in the protective effect of probiotic bacteria against virus particles is competition for cell surface attachment. this has already been proven in vitro, and reported as a feasible mechanism for the protection of cells in the case of VsV infection. 6, 11 Preservation of a cpG motif in bacterial DnA during inactivation of bacteria has been reported to suppress the apoptotic pathways and enhance the cell viability. 11, 35 our study demonstrated the higher viability of HsV-1 infected macrophage J774 cells treated with L. rhamnosus when compared to E. coli treatment, although the reason is unclear. one explanation of lower cells viability in the case of E. coli exposure compared to L. rhamnosus can be related to increased tnf-\u03b1 production induced by E. coli, which causes more cell apoptosis. We showed more tnf-\u03b1 production induced by E. coli exposure pre-and post-HsV-1 infection of the cells compared to L. rhamnosus. the presence of lipopolysaccharide in the cell wall of E. coli is a potential stimulator for tnf release. 36 increased viability of infected Vero cells by a supernatant of J774 cells exposed to L. rhamnosus might result from no, tnf-\u03b1 and ifn-\u03b3 production, as pro-inflammatory cytokines. 11,15 this suppressed HsV-1 proliferation. no release is another antiviral mechanism, which has also been previously reported. in fact, significant increase of no release was reported in co-incubated macrophage exposed to probiotic bacteria in the presence of ifn-\u03b3; however, ivec et al. stated that ifn-\u03b3 is not an important factor in the stimulation of no release. 11, 37 in our study, J774 cells co-incubated with live or inactive L. rhamnosus or E. coli were capable of inducing tnf-\u03b1, ifn-\u03b3 and no production. concentration of ifn-\u03b3 and its dependent mediator, no, is lower than those of a previous report. However, in that report, probiotic bacteria were applied with exogenous ifn-\u03b3, so it can be concluded that the simultaneous presence of ifn-\u03b3 with probiotic bacteria might be necessary for the production of high levels of no. 37 in the case of inactive bacteria, cell wall components such as peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid and cpG motifs can induce no, tnf-\u03b1 and ifn-\u03b3 production by cells; however, their levels were lower than those induced by live bacterial exposure. 11 in conclusion, L. rhamnosus was able to induce several antiviral effects against HsV-1, which might be through different mechanisms including competing with virus for cell surface attachment, increasing macrophage viability, following stimulation of pro-inflammatory responses. thus, our results suggest future in vivo evaluation of L. rhamnosus for increasing the immune defense in the cells as a probable candidate for HsV-1 infection co-therapy.",
