The rise of different big data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and, more recently, Spark, for massive data processing based on the MapReduce paradigm has allowed for the efficient utilisation of data mining methods and machine learning algorithms in different domains. A number of libraries such as Mahout and SparkMLib have been designed to develop new efficient applications based on machine learning algorithms. The combination of big data technologies and traditional machine learning algorithms has generated new and interesting challenges in other areas as social media and social networks. These new challenges are focused mainly on problems such as data processing, data storage, data representation, and how data can be used for pattern mining, analysing user behaviours, and visualizing and tracking data, among others. In this paper, we present a revision of the new methodologies that is designed to allow for efficient data mining and information fusion from social media and of the new applications and frameworks that are currently appearing under the \"umbrella\" of the social networks, social media and big data paradigms.

More recently, in 2012, Gartner [6] updated the definition as follows: \"Big data is high volume, high velocity, and/or high variety information assets that require new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight discovery and process optimization\". Both definitions refer to the three basic features of big data: Volume, Variety, and Velocity. Other organisations, and big data practitioners (e.g., researchers, engineers, and so on), have extended this 3V model to a 4V model by including a new \"V\": Value [7] . This model can be even extended to 5Vs if the concepts of Veracity is incorporated into the big data definition.",

This issue has generated a large number of open problems and challenges on social big data domain related to different aspects as knowledge representation, data management, data processing, data analysis, and data visualisation [17] . Some of these challenges include accessing to very large quantities of unstructured data (management issues), determination of how much data is enough for having a large quantity of high quality data (quality versus quantity), processing of data stream dynamically changing, or ensuring the enough privacy (ownership and security), among others.

Prepare the input: The MapReduce system designates map processors (or worker nodes), assigns the input key value K1 that each processor would work on, and provides each processor with all of the input data associated with that key value. 2. The Map() step: Each worker node applies the Map() function to the local data and writes the output to a temporary storage space. The Map() code is run exactly once for each K1 key value, generating output that is organised by key values K2. A master node arranges it so that for redundant copies of input data only one is processed. 3. The Shuffle() step: The map output is sent to the reduce processors, which assign the K2 key value that each processor should work on, and provide that processor with all of the map-generated data associated with that key value, such that all data belonging to one key are located on the same worker node. 4. The Reduce() step: Worker nodes process each group of output data (per key) in parallel, executing the user-provided Reduce() code; each function is run exactly once for each K2 key value produced by the map step. 5. Produce the final output: The MapReduce system collects all of the reduce outputs and sorts them by K2 to produce the final outcome. Fig. 2 shows the classical \"word count problem\" using the MapReduce paradigm. As Fig. 2 shown, initially a process will split the data into a subset of chunks that will later be processed by the mappers. Once the key/values are generated by mappers, a shuffling process is used to mix (combine) these key values (combining the same keys in the same worker node). Finally, the reduce functions are used to count the words that generate a common output as a result of the algorithm. As a result of the execution or wrappers/reducers, the output will generate a sorted list of word counts from the original text input.",

The Mahout(TM) Machine Learning (ML) library is an Apache(TM) project whose main goal is to build scalable libraries that contain the implementation of a number of the conventional ML algorithms (dimensionality reduction, classification, clustering, and topic models, among others). In addition, this library includes implementations for a set of recommender systems (user-based and item-based strategies). The first versions of Mahout implemented the algorithms built on the Hadoop framework, but recent versions include many new implementations built on the Mahout-Samsara environment, which runs on Spark and H2O. The new Spark-item similarity implementations enable the next generation of co-occurrence recommenders that can use entire user click streams and contexts in making recommendations. \u2022 Spark MLlib [22] . MLlib is Sparks scalable machine learning library, which consists of common learning algorithms and utilities, including classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, and dimensionality reduction, as well as underlying optimization primitives. It supports writing applications in Java, Scala, or Python and can run on any Hadoop2/YARN cluster with no preinstallation. The first version of MLlib was developed at UC Berkeley by 11 contributors, and it provided a limited set of standard machine learning methods. However, MLlib is currently experiencing dramatic growth, and it has over 140 contributors from over 50 organisations. \u2022 MLBase [23] . The MLbase platform consists of three layers: ML Optimizer, MLlib, and MLI. ML Optimizer (currently under development) aims to automate the task of ML pipeline construction. The optimizer solves a search problem over the feature extractors and ML algorithms included in MLI and MLlib. MLI [24] is an experimental API for feature extraction and algorithm development that introduces high-level ML programming abstractions. A prototype of MLI has been implemented against Spark and serves as a test bed for MLlib. Finally, MLlib is Apache Sparks distributed ML library. MLlib was initially developed as part of the MLbase project, and the library is currently supported by the Spark community. Pentaho is an open source data integration (Kettle) tool that delivers powerful extraction, transformation, and loading capabilities using a groundbreaking, metadata-driven approach.",

This means that the algorithms implemented using Giraph are vertex oriented. Apache Hama does not only allow users to work with Pregel-like graph applications. This computing engine can also be used to perform computeintensive general scientific applications and machine learning algorithms.

Despite the ambiguity of the community definition, numerous techniques have been used for detecting communities. Random walks, spectral clustering, modularity maximization, and statistical mechanics have all been applied to detecting communities [46] . These algorithms are typically based on the topology information from the graph or network. Related to graph connectivity, each cluster should be connected; that is, there should be multiple paths that connect each pair of vertices within the cluster. It is generally accepted that a subset of vertices forms a good cluster if the induced sub-graph is dense and there are few connections from the included vertices to the rest of the graph [47] .

These techniques can automatically organise a document corpus into clusters or similar groups based on a blind search in an unlabelled data collection, grouping the data with similar properties into clusters without human supervision. Generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two types [67] : partitioning algorithms that divide a document corpus into a given number of disjoint clusters that are optimal in terms of some predefined criteria functions [68] and hierarchical algorithms that group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure or a dendrogram [69] . Both types of clustering algorithms have strengths and weaknesses depending on the structure and characteristics of the dataset used. In Zhao and Karypis [70] , a comparative assessment of different clustering algorithms (partitioning and hierarchical) was performed using different similarity measures on high-dimensional text data. The study showed that partitioning algorithms perform better and can also be used to produce hierarchies of higher quality than those returned by the hierarchical ones.",

Such semantic heterogeneity includes not only linguistic differences (e.g., between 'reference' and 'bibliography') but also mismatching between conceptual structures. To deal with these problems, in [87] ontologies are exploited from multiple social networks, and more importantly, semantic correspondences obtained by ontology matching methods. More practically, semantic meshup applications have been illustrated. To remedy the data integration issues of the traditional web mashups, the semantic technologies uses the linked open data (LOD) based on RDF data model, as the unified data model for combining, aggregating, and transforming data from heterogeneous data resources to build linked data mashups [88] . \u2022 Social network integration. Next issue is how to integrate the distributed social networks. As many kinds of social networking services have been developed, users are joining multiple services for social interactions with other users and collecting a large amount of information (e.g., statuses on Facebook and tweets on Twitter). An interesting framework has been proposed for a social identity matching (SIM) method across these multiple SNS [89] . It means that the proposed approach can protect user privacy, because only the public information (e.g., username and the social relationships of the users) is employed to find the best matches between social identities. Particularly, cloud-based platform has been applied to build software infrastructure where the social network information can be shared and exchanged [90] .",

These methods are human language processing algorithms that aim to convert unstructured textual data from large-scale collections to a specific format, filtering them according to need. They can be used to detect words related to diseases or their symptoms in published texts [108] . However, this can be difficult because the same word can refer to different things depending upon context. Furthermore, a specific disease can have multiple associated names and symptoms, which increases the complexity of the problem. Ontologies can help to automate human understanding of key concepts and the relationships between them, and they allow for achieving a certain level of filtering accuracy. In the health domain, it is necessary to identify and link term classes such as diseases, symptoms, and species in order to detect the potential focus of disease outbreaks. Currently, there are a number of available biomedical ontologies that contain all of the necessary terms. For example, the BioCaster ontology [109] is based on the OWL Semantic Web language, and it was designed to support automated reasoning across terms in 12 languages.",

Furthermore, user posts retrieved from the public Twitter API can come with GPS-based location tags, which can be used to locate the potential centre of disease outbreaks. A number of works have already appeared that show the potential of Twitter messages to track and predict outbreaks. A document classifier to identify relevant messages was presented in Culotta [110] . In this work, Twitter messages related to the flu were gathered, and then a number of classification systems based on different regression models to correlate these messages with CDC statistics were compared; the study found that the best model had a correlation of 0.78 (simple model regression). Aramaki [111] presented a comparative study of various machinelearning methods to classify tweets related to influenza into two categories: positive and negative. Their experimental results showed that the SVM model that used polynomial kernels achieved the highest accuracy (FMeasure of 0.756) and the lowest training time.",

[119] conducted a comparative assessment of these three systems (BioCaster, EpiSpider, and HealthMap) related to their ability to gather and analyse information that is relevant to public health. EpiSpider obtained more relevant documents in this study. However, depending on the language of each system, the ability to acquire relevant information from different countries differed significantly. For instance, Biocaster gives special priority to languages from the Asia-Pacific region, and EpiSpider only considers documents written in English.
