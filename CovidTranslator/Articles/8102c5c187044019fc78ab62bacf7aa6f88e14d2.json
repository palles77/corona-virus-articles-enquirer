In addition to appropriate blood compatibility testing by blood typing and cross matching, infectious disease screening of the donors and donated units is crucial to assure the quality of blood components. Although strict guidelines ensure that only healthy donors are used, there is still the potential that donors can have subclinical viremia, bacteremia, or parasitemia and that the organisms could be transmitted via transfusion to a patient. Patients receiving blood transfusions are often debilitated and/or immunocompromised; therefore, transmission of infectious organisms can be a particularly devastating complication of transfusion therapy. Because emerging infectious diseases can potentially be transmitted through blood component transfusion, new screening technologies and schemes are being introduced in human and animal blood banks.",

In the only published report of bacterial contamination of veterinary blood products, units of feline whole blood at 1 institution were found to be contaminated during collection by Serratia marcescens via the saline flush used for sedation of feline donors, which resulted in recipient morbidity and mortality. 13 We describe here the investigations surrounding bacterial contamination of a single feline pRBC unit (sentinel unit) and experimental bacterial contamination of canine pRBCs stored at 4\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C in which standard gross and microscopic examinations, bacterial culture, and a novel semiquantitative real-time eubacterial 16S rRNA gene PCR test were used for blood product screening.",

Subsequent donations from this donor have not shown signs of contamination.

Unknowingly, 15 of the contaminated units were transfused to 14 patients, resulting in illness in 10 cats and death in 4 cats. Three of 5 units examined were discolored at the time of transfusion. Signs of a septic transfusion reaction in these cats included vomiting, pyrexia, collapse, panting, and acute death, consistent with septic shock.13 , 29 In the present report, the Pf-contaminated unit was removed from circulation as soon as the color change was noted, and, therefore, it was not transfused and did not cause harm to any patients. P. fluorescens is a Gram-negative rod that is ubiquitous in the environment, grows optimally at or below 30\u00b0C and as low as 2\u00b0C, and does not grow well at temperatures \u226537\u00b0C. These growth characteristics differentiate P. fluorescens from other pseudomonads such as P. aeruginosa,22 , 30 -32 and may explain why P. fluorescens was not isolated in the initial aerobic and anaerobic cultures at 37\u00b0C of the sentinel unit, although technical error cannot be excluded. Whole blood and pRBCs stored at 4\u00b0C provide an ideal growth medium for P. fluorescens and the potential for transfusing large numbers of this organism to patients must be seriously considered. 17 , 22 , 23 , 25 , 26 , 31 Clinical infection with P. fluorescens in cats and dogs is mostly limited to otitis externa33; P. fluorescens has yet to be reported as a cause of transfusion-related septicemia in animals.

Gibb et al17 showed that P. fluorescens had a growth plateau at a concentration of ~3 \u00d7 10 8 CFU/mL human blood, which is similar to the number of organisms estimated in the sentinel unit when a color change was observed (~3.45 \u00d7 10 8 CFU/mL).",

Screening tools include Gram stain, visual examination of color changes, swirling the units to identify changes in consistency, glucose measurement, and reagent strips to identify oxygen depletion by microbial organisms or to detect pH changes.7 , 10 , 20 , 21 , 35 -37 It has been postulated that the cause of the color change in contaminated units is a combination of decreased pO 2 and hemolysis.37 Methemoglobin may also contribute to the color change but was not measured in the present study because the reference laboratory would not accept contaminated blood for testing. To date, culture has been the gold standard for bacterial isolation in human blood products, however, some organisms such as P. fluorescens require nonstandard culture conditions for growth, and culture is an insensitive method if performed on the first day of collection when bacterial counts are low.21",

Furthermore, in 1 study that evaluated color changes in 15 stored pRBC units deliberately contaminated with 5 different concentrations of Y. enterocolitica, every contaminated unit showed a color change with prolonged storage that was preceded by positive bacterial culture, similar to our observations.37",

Although bacterial colonies were not actually grown for quantification, CFU estimates based on microscopic review of a smear prepared from the sentinel unit suggested that \u22651.38 \u00d7 10 3 CFU/\u03bcL (1.38 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/ mL) was needed for a positive result, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher than the 10 2 -10 3 CFU/mL described for human blood.21 Beside being cost prohibitive to screen all collected units, it would be challenging to use PCR testing as a screening tool for bacterial contamination of all animal blood products because they are often used immediately after collection, on-site testing of units shortly before transfusion would not be generally available, and samples would need to be shipped to specific reference laboratories for 16S PCR testing, thus delaying results by 1-2 days. The assay may prove useful, however, for testing units that are approaching expiration or for following up units in which a color change has occurred or which resulted in transfusion reactions. Moreover, the PCR product can also be sequenced, permitting precise bacterial species identification. If 16S PCR testing is unavailable, screening tools such as evaluation of color change, Gram stain, and monitoring of pH and glucose concentration, as well as bacterial culture at 37\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C may prove useful.7 , 20 , 35",
