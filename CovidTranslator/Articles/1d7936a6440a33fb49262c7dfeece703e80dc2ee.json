The globalization of infectious diseases has become a new form of epidemic.

Schumacher et al. conducted a survey which showed that specialist registrars had the best knowledge of PPE requirements for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), but had less so about those for anthrax, plague, Ebola virus, and smallpox. 7 Respiratory protective equipment is still the preferred PPE when dealing with Ebola virus. 8 The PPBPC is currently the world's most commonly used high-grade PPE. The PPBPC, which provides the wearer with high-level body and respiratory protection, should be widely used in laboratories requiring high-level biosafety and during infectious disease rescue efforts.",

            "text": "The MIST is one of the most widely used methods for evaluating protective clothing. ASTM F2588-12 specifies the standard test method (MIST) for protective clothing using human body simulation tests. MIST provides an assessment of the overall protective clothing system including the materials, seams, zippers, and other accessories. Ormond believes that the ability to detect lower levels of permeation or penetration under current standard conditions pushes analytical methods and instruments to their operating limits. Therefore, to more accurately evaluate airtight protective clothing, some changes to the standard method must be considered. Here we discuss potential approaches to make the MIST method more suitable for evaluating fully hermetic protective clothing. These methods include increasing the contact dose, changing the air sampler properties, enhancing the analytical detection limits, or any combination of these. 11 Gao et al. believe that ASTM F 2588-06 provides a detailed description of the test procedure, but does not provide specific requirements for the design of the test chamber. Based on a literature survey of existing test chambers, and a review of the current and proposed standards and test methods, cabin design requirements will depend on the test method chosen. Since the test conditions for aerosol/particle and vapor integration tests vary widely, a single chamber is unlikely to be used to test for all types of protective clothing. 12 EN943-2015 stipulates that airtight protective clothing should pass the practical performance test when worn by personnel for a testing time of 30 minutes.",

Therefore, there is an increasing demand for PPBPC. Some biosafety laboratories have led to outbreaks owing to poor management, further increasing people's awareness of the need for risk prevention. 15 Choosing suitable protective clothing for BSL-4 laboratories is very important. K\u00fcmin et al. designed an experiment to compare models of different brands of PPBPC. Their results showed that there is no perfect product; there were positive and negative aspects of all products tested. This is also the case with the present study. 16 China has a late start in researching positive pressure biological protective equipment. Currently, completed BSL-4 laboratories have adopted imported products. Since the ''Twelfth Five-Year Plan\" period, Chinese researchers have succeeded in overcoming the main technical problems of PPBPC and have developed positive pressure PPE that meets the international standards. Wang D conducted a performance comparison between a positive pressure biological protective clothing (type B) produced in China and a suit (type A) produced abroad. Both suits exhibited a similar performance in terms of convenience, comfort, noise, and so on, and met the current operational requirements for high-level biosafety laboratories. 17 At present, PPBPC can provide a high level of protection to wearers in terms of technology. The question that remains is, how can it be widely applied to front-line rescue personnel in an outbreak? This requires national attention and multisectoral cooperation, including financial resources for supporting, training, and educating. Hanoa et al. believe that the steps from ''safe enough\" to ''absolutely secure\" seem to be insurmountable in most countries owing to cost and logistics. 18, 19 6.

In 1998, the European Union issued the standard EN 1073-1, which regulates the performance of the air supply system, and the intake and exhaust valves. In 2002, EN 943-1:2002 was issued, which addressed the material utilized by and the overall protection of gas-tight protective clothing (Type 1 and Type 2), with the performance and test methods being specified in detail. In 2002, the ISO issued ISO 16602:2002, which was revised in 2007. In 2003, the CEN issued EN 14126, which regulates the performance requirements and test methods of virus protective clothing, and specifies the requirements for the viral permeability of protective clothing fabric.
