It is proved that the approximate concept satisfiability (definitely satisfiability and possibly satisfiability) reasoning problem and approximate concepts rough subsumption reasoning problem w.r.t. rough TBox in RDL AC may be reduced to the concept satisfiability reasoning problem in (almost) standard ALC (the description logic that provides the Boolean concept constructors plus the existential and universal restriction constructors).

DL systems provide their users with inference services (like computing the subsumption hierarchy) that deduce implicit knowledge from the explicitly represented knowledge. They are employed in various application domains, such as semantic Web [21, 39] , ontologies [1] , databases [6, 19] , and software engineering [4] . Because classical DLs [3] can only represent and reason on certain or precise knowledge, and cannot represent and reason on uncertain or imprecise knowledge, therefore, some researchers extend classical DLs allowing to express uncertain or imprecise knowledge. At this aspect, three kinds of description logics, i.e., fuzzy DLs, probabilistic DLs, and rough DLs, are proposed.",

            "text": "In what follows, we will use several DLs, hence it is necessary to introduce some notations of DLs firstly. The DL that provides the Boolean concept constructors plus the existential and universal restriction constructors is called ALC [38] , where the Boolean concept constructors are, apart from concept disjunction, concept conjunction and concept negation. In addition to the Booleans, and existential and universal restriction constructors, DLs typically provide concept constructors that form complex concepts. The basic constructors of this kind are qualified number restrictions, unqualified number restrictions, functional number restrictions, nominals, concrete domain [3] . More expressive DLs can be obtained by extending ALC with new concept constructors. For example, the logic obtained from ALC by providing qualified number restrictions is called 0020-0255/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.ins.2008. 10.021 ALCQ. On the other hand, adding unqualified, functional number restrictions, nominals, and concrete domains to ALC results in the logics ALCN, ALCF, ALCO, and ACL(D), respectively. Furthermore, besides concept constructors, DLs may provide a set of role constructors such as inversion and transitive closure operator. The logics that extend ALC with inversion and transitive closure operator are called ALCI and ALC + , respectively. In ALC the RBox is required to be empty. Therefore, one way to provide new useful expressivity is to allow different sorts of axioms such as transitivity axioms and role inclusion axioms in the RBox. The extensions of ALC with transitive roles and role inclusion axioms are called ALCR + and ALCH, respectively. The logic ALCHR + is commonly known as SH. The different extensions of SH are commonly denoted by appending the corresponding calligraphic letter (I for role inversion, O for nominals, D for concrete domains, F, N, Q for functional, unqualified and qualified number restrictions, respectively) to the name of the logic. For instance, the extension of SH with inverse roles, nominals, qualified number restrictions and concrete domains is known as SHOIQ(D).",

            "text": "In rough description logic RDL [37] , for every concept C 2 RDL, the corresponding lower approximation C and upper approximation C also are concepts of RDL, i.e., C, C 2 RDL. Moreover, C and C are two different separate concepts, that is to say, C and C are not be integrated into a uniform approximate concept hC; Ci. However, it is well-known that when it is impossible to formally define a concept C, we can often make use of the approximations (the lower approximation C and the upper approximation C\u00de together, i.e., approximate concept (or rough set) hC; Ci, to express the concept C in a precise way with explicit formal semantics, in other words, only single lower approximation C or upper approximation C cannot express the concept C in a precise way. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a kind of new reasoning algorithm of rough description logics based on approximate concepts (not single lower approximation or upper approximation). On the other hand, approximate concept corresponds to the notion of rough set in rough set theory [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , as a uniform concept, approximate concept is applied in ontologies, i.e., approximate concepts based approximate ontologies are presented [8] . It is well-known that description logics are the logic foundations of Web ontology language [2] , i.e., the Web ontology languages are equivalent to description logics in theory. For example, the Web ontology language OWL Lite and OWL DL have a formal semantics and a reasoning support through a mapping to the expressive description logics SHIF(D) and SHOIN(D), respectively, [13] . Comparing with the classical ontologies [10] , there exist same problem in approximate ontologies [8] : what are the logic foundations (or reasoning algorithms) of approximate ontologies? Naturally, we also need a kind of reasoning algorithm of rough description logics based on approximate concepts. That is to say, approximate concepts must be introduced to description logics from a theoretical point of view. The present work may be considered as an attempt in this direction.",

The cause and underlying cellular pathways of this disease are unclear, which hinders the precise characterization of the sepsis patient. Therefore, a consensus definition of sepsis was established in 1992 to define several stages of sepsis [5] . This definition does not provide a precise definition of sepsis, but gives the criteria for which there was a consensus that they should at least hold for a patient with sever sepsis. These criteria are called as Bone criteria. Patients who accord with Bone criteria may have sepsis, however, this is not necessarily the case. We refer to these patients as being possibly septic. On the other hand, we can define a group of patients that are septic for sure, namely those who fulfill the Bone criteria and have severe multiple organ failure. We refer to these patients as the definitely septic patients and define them as fulfilling the strict criteria.",

Specifically, a formal framework for defining approximate concepts, ontologies and operations on approximate concepts and ontologies is presented, and algorithms for automatically generating approximate ontologies from traditional crisp ontologies or from data sets together with additional knowledge is presented. However, Doherty's work (which is perhaps the one closest in spirit to our own), is not based on logics (or description logics), so their semantics is non-standard, and approximate concepts are not be integrated in standard ontology language such as description logics. The works described in this paper introduce approximate concepts to description logics based on rough set theory from a theoretical point of view.",

To this direction approximate concepts are introduced to description logics based on rough set theory, a kind of new rough description logic RDL AC is proposed based on approximate concepts. The syntax, semantics, properties and reasoning problems of the RDL AC are given. Interestingly, we allow approximate concepts to appear in a rough description logic knowledge base. Although our rough description logic RDL AC is strictly speaking not more expressive than classical DLs such as ALC, the approximate concepts that we introduce are useful modeling devices for uncertain or imprecise knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, the work described in this paper is the first result about integration between description logics and approximate concepts. Therefore, theoretical foundations for reasoning algorithms of more expressive rough description logics including approximate concepts, number restrictions, nominals, inverse roles and role hierarchies are provided by the RDL AC . As far as future directions are concerned, these will include the approximate concept satisfiability and approximate concepts rough subsumption reasoning algorithms of rough description logics including number restrictions, nominals, inverse roles and role hierarchies, and an integration between approximate concepts and fuzzy DLs [17, 41, 42] or probabilistic DLs [12, 28] based on fuzzy rough set theory [27, 30, 43, 50, 51] or probabilistic rough set theory [7, 45, 52] , respectively. Furthermore, additional research effort can be focused on the investigation of the construction of approximate ontologies (or rough TBoxes) using formal concept analysis.",
