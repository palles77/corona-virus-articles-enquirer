Our study revealed that L. houdyshelii had the lowest light compensation point (LCP), while the other three species had higher LCP (12.37-14.99 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 ); L. aurea had the highest light saturation point (LSP) (1,189 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 ), and L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora had lower LSP with the values being 322 and 345 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 , respectively, and L. radiata var. pumila showed the intermediate LSP. Both the species L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora exhibited a typical and obvious decline in net photosynthetic rate (P N ) during midday, which was not observed in L. aurea. This indicated a possible photoinhibition in L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora as the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (F v /F m ) values were higher in these two species. The minimal fluorescence (F 0 ) values were lower in L. aurea and L. radiata var. pumila. The diurnal changes of transpiration rate (E) in all four species presented only one peak, appearing between 11:00 h or 13:00 h. By using simple correlation analyses, it was observed that the environmental factors affecting P N were different among four species and the main factors were photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and relative humidity especially for L. aurea and L. radiata. The results of studying indicated that the four species could be divided into two groups. The species L. radiata var. pumila and L. aurea were more adapted to a relatively high irradiance, and L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora could be grown in moderate-shade environment in order to scale up their growth and productivity.

            "text": "Lycoris Herb. (Amaryllidaceae) is comprised of about 20 species native to the subtropical regions of eastern Asia, of which 15 (10 endemic) are distributed in China. Most of the species are commonly cultivated in China, Japan, and the United States as bulbous plants (Hsu et al. 1994 , Shi et al. 2006 . The Lycoris species are all very popular bulb flowers worldwide with considerable acceptance as ornamental plant (Zhou et al. 2007) . Most of the Lycoris species have been successfully cultivated. They are summer-and autumn-blooming plants of great beauty and common in the gardens of China, Japan, and the United States. In comparison with other well-known bulb flowers, such as narcissi and lilies, Lycoris has its own characteristics and merits. Lycoris comes into flower at a time when few other bulbous plants are active. The flowers are characterized by their pastel and plentiful colors as well as by beautiful and varied shapes (Hsu et al. 1994 ). Recently, the demand for cut flowers of Lycoris has increased with diversification of flower consumption, so breeding of varieties with new flower forms and/or colors has become desirable for Lycoris (Katsukawa et al. 2000) . Moreover, Lycoris species are all of medical value. For example, the compound galantamine, isolated from several plants including Lycoris radiata Herb., which was used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is licensed in the United Kingdom for the treatment of mild to moderate neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Howes and Houghton 2003) ; the compound lycorine from L. radiata extract was an anti-SARS-CoV component and a candidate for the development of new anti-SARS-CoV drugs in the treatment of SARS .",

Measurements of photosynthetic and morphological responses to light may reveal the tolerance of species to light intensity and have been useful in agriculture, ecology, forestry and horticulture (Aleric and Kirkman 2005, Wang et al. 2006) . Efficient photosynthetic activity is necessary for the high production of plant biomass. Chlorophyll fluorescence is a quantitative and qualitative indicator of light-dependent photosynthetic processes, provides a nondestructive, rapid means of assessing both photochemical quantum yield and photoinhibition and has been widely employed as an indicator of plant response to stresses (Mauromicale et al. 2006 , Mauro et al. 2011 . Little is known about the leaf photosynthesis characteristics of Lycoris species (Guo et al. 2007 . The growth and photosynthetic responses of three Lycoris species with leaf appearing in spring to levels of irradiance were studied, and no attention was paid to the diurnal changes in gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of these species (Meng et al. 2008) . In this study, we investigated the diurnal changes of P N and relative parameters of four Lycoris species with leaf appearing in autumn, in addition to correlations between P N and environmental factors by correlation analysis. This was done to help determine which factors limit gas exchange under field conditions for the four species. It was the final objective to provide basic information for their cultivation and promote their productivity.",

The air temperature increased with increase in PPFD just since morning. Thereafter the PPFD declined in the afternoon (Fig. 1B) . The values of C a at sunrise were remarkably higher than those at sunset (Fig. 1C) . The diurnal change of RH was opposite to the diurnal changes of PPFD and T a , with its minimum at about 13:00 h (Fig. 1D) . P N -PPFD response of different species: As the lightresponse curves of the four Lycoris species showed (Fig. 2) , when the PPFD was below 150 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 , all the curves responded linearly and rapidly. It suggested that all the four Lycoris species had relatively higher light-use efficiency under low irradiance, corresponding with the high values of apparent quantum yield (AQY) of these species being from 0.0676 to 0.0798. With the exception of L. aurea, the net assimilation in all species were almost constant with decreased light intensity until the PPFD was 300 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 . The curve of L. aurea was gradually at a plateau, when the PPFD exceeded about 1,000 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 . The P max , LSP, and LCP of L. aurea were all remarkably higher than those of the other three species, with the values being 17.10, 1,189 and 14.9 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 , respectively (Table 1) . P N , g s , C i , and E of leaves: Diurnal changes of P N showed similar patterns in L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora (Fig. 3A) , where P N increased steeply in the morning. After reaching a minimum at about 13:00 h, with a slow recovery in the later afternoon, finally P N in all four species showed a sharp decline. The trend is typical of altiplano plants. However the species L. radiata var. pumila exhibited a slight decline in P N to 11.19 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 at 13:00 h during midday, and also had two peaks at 11:00 h and 15:00 h eventhough the second peak was not conspicuous. In contrast to the other three species, L. aurea had only one peak of P N , reaching the maximum 14.66 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 at about 11:00 h, and kept relatively high P N during midday till 13:00 h, indicating L. aurea was more adapted to irradiance and high-temperature stress. No significant difference in transpiration rate (E) was observed among all the four species (Fig. 3B) , except that the values of E in L. radiata var. pumila and L. aurea were markedly higher than those in L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora during midday and the peak value of L. aurea appeared at about 13:00 h with the other three ones appearing at about 11:00 h (Fig. 3B ).",

The findings presented here will improve our understanding of photosynthetic characteristics of the four species and assist in the optimization of irradiances needed to improve their productivity. It is suggested that the photosynthetic capacity of a plant was determined to large extent by its natural habitat and itself, and some photosynthesis parameters, such as P max , LCP, LSP and AQY were important factors for assisting in the optimization of growth irradiance and improving its productivity Ma 2009, Huang et al. 2009 ). As important indexes for determining the shade-tolerant ability in a plant, LCP and LSP could exhibit directly its photosynthetic capacity under poor irradiance environments. The lower the LCP of a plant, the higher its photosynthetic capacity; the lower the LSP of a plant, the less the time took for it to reach P max with the PPFD increasing (Liu et al. 2007) . For many sun plants, the range of LSP and LCP are about 1,500-2,000 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 and 50-100 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 , respectively; as to the shade plants, generally, LCP was below 20 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 and LSP is lower than that of the sun plant (Jiang et al. 2004) . The shade-tolerant plants have relatively large AQY and possess strong ability of capturing photons for photosynthesis in natural low light environments, with the AQY being from 0.02 to 0.05 (Osborne and Raven 1986 , Lee et al. 1990 , Liu et al. 2007 . The values of LSP and LCP of the four species were all below 1,200 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 and 20 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 , respectively, and the values of AQY were all about 0.7, indicating that all the four species should share some photosynthetic characteristics of shade plants, such as low LSP, LCP, and high AQY. Comparing with L. radiata var. pumila and L. aurea, the values of light saturation points of both L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora were lower, suggesting that the latter two species could not efficiently utilize relatively strong light and could be considered as typical shade-loving plants. However, L. aurea had relatively higher LSP 1,189 \u03bcmol m -2 s -1 , indicating that it could acclimate to strong irradiance to some extent, corresponding with the high photosynthesis rate, suggesting it as a shade-tolerant plant preferring moderate-light environment.",

However L. aurea exhibited a single-peak curve. Stomatal limitation and nonstomatal limitation are both important factors resulting in decline of P N in plant (Xu 1997 ). When C i and g s decreased simultaneously, the decline in P N was mainly caused by stomatal limitation (Farquhar and Sharkey 1982) . As shown in Fig. 3 , the change of C i and g s was nearly similar in L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora at midday from 11:00 h to 13:00 h, and both showed declining trend. Therefore the decrease in P N of the two species at midday was mainly under stomatal control and g s appeared to be limiting factor in these two species.",

            "text": "Chl fluorescence measurements were performed on dark-adapted attached leaves of four Lycoris species. The F v /F m ratio indicates the intrinsic efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Wu et al. 1997) . A reduction in F v /F m is often taken to indicate photoinhibition (Powles 1984). As shown in Fig. 4B , there were no significant differences in F v /F m measured at 7:00 h among four species, and all values were greater than 0.76. The value was slightly lower than the average of the values found in leaves of a wide range of C 3 species (0.83; Bj\u00f6rkman and Demmig 1987) . This indicated that the four species were either not stressed or were mostly unaffected by light stress in the morning . The values of F v /F m measured in the midday (12:00-14:00 h) showed transient slight decreases (1.7 % and 1.4 %, respectively) in L. radiata var. pumila and L. aurea, which is a general feature of photosynthesis in natural environment (Veres et al. 2002, Li and . In comparison decline was greater in L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora than in L. radiata var. pumila and L. aurea,. In the strong irradiance of midday, the values of F v /F m of the former two species were all higher than the latter two species, which proved that L. radiata var. pumila and L. aurea were more tolerant to high T air and irradiance, corresponding to the results of the light-response curves. The damage of the apparatus of PSII often results in increase in F 0 (Wu et al. 1997) . As shown in Fig. 4A , increases in F 0 suggested some damage of the apparatus of PSII or rearrangement of LHC complexes in L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora during midday.",

The photosynthetic characteristics of four Lycoris species showed great differences. The correlation between the photosynthetic rate and environmental factors in the leaves of L. radiata var. pumila and L. aurea revealed that the two factors of primary importance were PPFD and relative humidity. Therefore these two environmental factors should be carefully considered for cultivation of Lycoris sp. L. radiata var. pumila and L. aurea were more adapted to a relatively high irradiance. L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora could be grown in moderate-shade environment in order to scale up its growth and productivity. We can choose the suitable species to cultivate and conditions of growth according to our aims in the future research and utilization.",
