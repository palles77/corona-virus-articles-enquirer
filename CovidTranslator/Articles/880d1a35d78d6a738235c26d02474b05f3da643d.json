            "text": "Asthma is characterized by airway chronic inflammation, which is the pathophysiological base of airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling [1, 2] . The latter is a complex process that involves all of the component tissues of the airway from the epithelium to the adventitia, which includes epithelial cell damage and mucus gland hypertrophy, reticular basement membrane thickening, alterations in connective tissue composition, and an increase in the content of smooth muscle in the airway wall as a result of hyperplasia and hypertrophy [3] . Increasing evidence indicates that the asthmatic airway smooth muscle (ASM) plays an important role in the remodeling of the airway in asthma [4] [5] [6] . The remodeling of the asthmatic rat airway is extensively characterized in vivo; smooth muscle mass is considered to be the main determinant in the airway response to allergen stimulus. McVicker and colleagues concluded that repeat allergen inhalation induced cytoskeletal remodeling in the smooth muscle of rat bronchioles. Increased F-actin content resulted in alterations in the composition and/or arrangement of the contractile apparatus after albumin exposure; such a mechanism may have relevance for airway hyperreponsiveness (AHR) found in allergic asthma [1] . Janssen found that some therapeutic drugs, such as cortisteroids and \u03b2 2 -agonists, were potent inhibitors of ASM cell (ASMC) proliferation, which suggested ASMC was used as a target of asthma therapy [4] . Although the structural changes in morphology concerning ASM in asthma is clear, the mechanism responsible for cellular hyperplasia has not been determined.",

            "text": "They are not merely isozymes of identical function, but have specialized roles in cell signaling and specific cellular responses. In recent years we have reported that PKC\u03b1 contributes to the pathogenesis of asthma by promoting the proliferation of passively-sensitized human ASMC [9] . ASMC are normally quiescent, proliferate at low indices, and remain at the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle. Studies of bronchial biopsies in mild asthmatics reveal that extracellular stimuli transducer proliferative responses move ASMC through the cell cycle, which comprises of distinct phases G 1 , S (DNA synthesis), G 2 , and M (mitosis). D-type cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, and D3), in conjunction with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)4 and CDK6, are thought to be key regulators of growth control and G 1 /S transition [10] [11] [12] . The expression of cyclinD1 is upregulated primarily by specific mitogens and is needed for the subsequent expression of cyclins E and A. Mammary gland tissues overexpressing cyclinD1 result in tumor development, which further supports the crucial role of cyclinD1 in regulating cell growth and proliferation [13] [14] [15] . However, the results that PKC is involved in the process of ASM remodeling by regulating the expression of cyclinD1 in asthmatic rats have not been reported before. Elucidation of the PKC pathway and its downstream will no doubt lead to novel therapies designed to prevent or reverse these changes, so in this present study, we determined whether PKC\u03b1 could promote the proliferation of ASMC by regulating the expression of cyclinD1.",

Treatment with a combination of PMA and Ro31-8220 had no effect on the expression levels of PKC\u03b1 ( Figure 3A ). The cyclinD1 mRNA expression level was similar to PKC\u03b1 ( Figure  3B ).

In addition, pcDNA3.1-ascyclinD1 almost completely attenuated the PMA-induced growth acceleration of ASMC as the Ro31-8220+pcDNA3.1 group, which indicates that the PMA-mediated upregulation of cyclinD1 involves the remodeling of the ASM via the PKC signaling pathway in asthmatic rats.",

PKC signaling pathways have been considered as a signaling pathway involved in proliferation, cell cycle progression, differentiation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal remodeling, modulation of ion channels, and secretion initiated by the mitogenic stimulators mentioned earlier [23] . Experiments in vivo and in vitro have suggested their potent activity in the respiratory tracts. In the present study, PMA, a phorbol ester, which is a known substitute for diacylglycerol as a high-affinity ligand for conventional PKC and novel PKC isoforms [24] , stimulated PKC\u03b1 gene expression and protein production in ASMC, and accelerated cell proliferation. On the contrary, Ro31-8220 , the selective inhibitor of PKC, repressed the expression of PKC\u03b1 compared with the control and arrested the cell cycle at the G 0 /G 1 phase, suggesting that increasing PKC\u03b1 induced by PMA might have contributed to the proliferation of asthmatic ASM. The results were consistent with the article reported earlier, but contrasted with other studies concerning the role of PKC. These divergent observations could at least be partly explained by differences in the subtypes of PKC, the kinds of tissues, and the various concentrations of PMA.",

For example, G 1 -phase cell cycle proteins stimulate human intestinal smooth muscle cell growth induced by IGF-1 [25] .

Hammerhead ribozymes targeting against cyclin and E2F1 cooperated to downregu-late coronary smooth muscle proliferation [27] . G 1 phase cyclins played a role in the cell cycle progression. The 3 D-type cyclins display significant homology; this has been interpreted as indicating that they may have overlapping functions [28] . However, their expression patterns vary widely among different cell types, suggesting the possibility of distinct functions. CyclinD1 has been the most studied cyclin in ASM biology and has been qualified as a proto-oncogene based on its overexpression in human and animal malignancies as well as its tumorigenic effects in gene transfer experi- ASMCs were incubated in serum free medium for 24 h to induce quiescence, followed by addition of PMA or pcDNA3.1-ascyclinD1, and cultured for 24 h, and FACS analyses were conducted. (C) Immunocytochemistry staining for PCNA (\u00d7100). 5\u00d710 4 ASMCs were seeded on the slides, after serum starvation for 24 h and then cultured in various mediums for 24 h, immunocytochemistry staining were performed with antibodies specific for PCNA. Scale bars=20 \u00b5 m. ments with cultured cells and transgenic mice. In bovine ASM, mitogenic stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induced cyclinD1 transcriptional activation and protein synthesis, consequently resulting in the hyperphosphorylation of phospho-retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which then released the elongation factor E2F that activates DNA polymerase [29] . Consistent with a previous study, the conclusion from our experiment illustrates that cyclinD1 is related to the proliferation of asthmatic ASMC in vitro. The expression of cyclinD1 increased in response to PMA as well as the proliferative activity, but the effect of Ro31-8220 was the opposite, indicating that the PMA-mediated upregulation of cyclinD1 is involved in ASMC proliferation. After being transfected with the pcDNA3.1-ascyclinD1 plasmid containing the Brown Norway rat ascyclinD1 CDS fragment, our data of cell proliferation assessed by MTT, flow cytometry, and the expression rate of PCNA, showed that the ASMC were in a growth suppression state, which further suggested that cyclinD1 could stimulate the proliferation of asthmatic ASMC in vitro.",

            "text": "However, the mechanism of the increased proliferative activity of ASMC induced by PMA is unclear. It should be noted that the upstream of the signaling pathway ultimately regulates the cell cycle through the key proteins of the cell cycle. Another study has also demonstrated that vascular smooth muscle cells exhibit acceleration from the G 0 phase to the S phase in the cell cycle progression in response to the activation of PKC [30] . Skaletz-Rorowsk found that the PKC inhibitor can inhibit human and bovine aortic smooth muscle DNA synthesis through the downregulation of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) induced by cyclinD1, yet PMA increased the synthesis of DNA [31] . Accumulating studies have shown that PKC regulates the cell cycle procession by G 1 -phase cyclins. It is known that phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isoforms, as the cellular receptor for phorbol esters and other tumor promoters, play a significant role in transmitting mitogenic signaling and promoting cell proliferation [32, 33] . Thus, the PKC activation-induced cyclinD1 expression further emphasizes the connection between cell cycle regulation and signaling transduction. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the observation on the expression of cyclinD1 in response to PKC in ASMC. Our results clearly demonstrate that the expression of cyclinD1 is positively relative to the expression of PKC\u03b1 as expected. ASMC transfected with the pcDNA3.1-ascyclinD1 plasmid simultaneously inhibited PMA-induced S-phase traversal as Ro31-8220+pcDNA3.1, suggesting that PKC signaling pathways lead to the production of cyclinD1 in asthmatic ASMC, and a PKC-cyclinD1 cascade might be responsible for the proliferation in response to PMA. CyclinD1 could be a key downstream target of PKC\u03b1; that downstream transcription factor target of PKC\u03b1 could regulate cyclinD1 transcriptional activity and cell cycle progression, which elucidates the mechanism that PKC\u03b1 is involved in the remodeling of airway through regulating the cyclinD1 expression.",
