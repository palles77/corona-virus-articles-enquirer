A two-phase modified Delphi survey of professionals with known expertise in One Health ('expert panel') was used to 1) identify key knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) of GPs and veterinarians that would be consistent with a One Health approach to zoonoses; and 2) determine priorities for future surveys with Australian GPs and veterinarians to identify important gaps that impede effective diagnosis and management of zoonoses. A list of 13 topics/sub-topics, as well as a list of 25 specific zoonotic diseases/agents emerged from the first phase of the survey. In the second phase the expert panel identified general knowledge of the clinical aspects and epidemiological aspects of zoonoses, as well as risk management practices, as the most important KAPs and research priorities for both GPs and veterinarians. In terms of diseases, the expert panel regarded knowledge of Hendra virus, Q fever, Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), anthrax and Brucella suis most important for veterinarians, whilst for GPs, Q fever, gastrointestinal/foodborne diseases, influenza, ABLV and local vector-borne diseases were found to be most important by the expert panel. Some differences were noted in terms of prioritization of topics/sub-topics and diseases/agents according to expert background (veterinary and non-veterinary). The Delphi survey technique enabled efficient collection of data from a diverse range of One Health 'experts'/specialists and provided clear priorities for proposed future research, and potentially for educational interventions to improve One Health efficacy of clinicians.",

At a policy level, both in Australia and overseas, the increasing worldwide incidence of emerging infectious diseases (EID) of zoonotic origin has precipitated initiatives to foster cross-sectoral co-operation with varying degrees of success [1] [2] [3] [4] . In Australia, this includes creation of a number of informal and semi-formal special interest groups (SIGs), with membership largely spanning government (human health and animal health) and academia. To date, both in Australia and overseas, there has been less focus on implementation of One Health in clinical settings [5] [6] [7] . This is a recognized gap in Australia, with some SIGs suggesting research into the current knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) of general medical practitioners (GPs) and veterinarians with regard to zoonotic disease identification and management is needed to identify pathways for inclusion (S. Britton, personal email communication 19 August 2016).",

GPs and veterinarians are often the 'first line' responders when it comes to recognising, diagnosing, referring and/or treating such diseases in the face of an outbreak. Previous studies have shown that both veterinary and medical practitioners agree that cross professional collaboration can be useful in management of zoonoses [6, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, in most countries there are no established pathways to facilitate collaboration and referral across current professional boundaries [6, 15] . Further, a significant shift in attitude, as well as development of new legal precedents will be necessary for these approaches to become part of routine clinical practice [6, 7, 15] . Aside from work by Rabinowitz and Conti which details clinical approaches to zoonoses and other shared risks [16] , there is little agreement on what One Health actually looks like in clinical practice.",

An internet search of proposed experts enabled us to identify the backgrounds of most people, with the majority of those from an animal health background having a veterinary degree, and medical practitioners being identified as either infectious diseases or public health medicine specialists. A number of those with an animal health background had expertise in wildlife and ecological health but, as in a previous study in Australia [1] , it was difficult to identify One Health 'experts' from a purely environmental health background.

Two researchers (SM and SS) read and manually coded the Phase One data independently. Each established a list of topics that emerged from the data. They then met to compare findings. Agreement was reached on a list of thirteen topics and subtopics. A list of zoonotic and emerging diseases that were named by Phase One respondents was also compiled.

Fig. 2 shows that experts with a veterinary background see referral between professions as more important for the One Health efficacy of GPs and veterinarians, than do experts with a non-veterinary background. Forty-two per cent of experts with a veterinary background rated this topic as extremely important for GPs, compared to only 12.5% of experts with a non-veterinary background (p = 0.049; Fig. 2 and supplementary Table S2 ). Similarly, 48.4% of experts with a veterinary background rated this topic as extremely important for veterinarians, compared to 12.5% of experts with a non-veterinary background (p = 0.024). Table 3 shows the summative scores and ranks for each topic/subtopic. The following five topics/sub-topics were identified by the expert panel as the top priorities for a future survey with veterinarians (in decreasing order of importance): clinical aspects of zoonoses, epidemiology of zoonoses, advice to clients/patients, general risk management and use of PPE (Table 3) . For GPs, the following five topics/sub-topics were identified by the expert panel as the top priorities for a future survey: clinical aspects of zoonoses, epidemiology of zoonoses, advice to clients/patients, general risk management and history taking. Experts with veterinary and non-veterinary backgrounds were in agreement with respect to the top five topics to be prioritised for future surveys of veterinarians (supplementary Table S3 ). However, experts with a veterinary background placed greater emphasis on research into professional collaboration and advice to clients for GPs, whereas experts from a non-veterinary background saw general risk management and PPE as higher priorities for research with this target audience. Table 4 shows the summative scores and ranks for each disease/ agent. For veterinarians, knowledge and understanding of Hendra virus, Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), Q fever, anthrax and Brucella suis were perceived as most important by the expert panel. For GPs, knowledge and understanding of Q fever, gastrointestinal and foodborne infections, influenza, ABLV and local vector-borne diseases was deemed most important by the expert panel. Some differences existed in terms of ranking of specific diseases according to respondent background (supplementary Table S4 ). Most notably, according to experts with a veterinary background, Chlamydia psittaci was amongst the top 5 ranked diseases in terms of importance of knowledge and understanding by GPs. This disease had a relatively low summative score, based on rankings by experts from a non-veterinary background. The latter deemed knowledge and understanding of ABLV as being of greater importance to GPs. Similarly, experts with a veterinary background were more inclined to rate knowledge of gastrointestinal and foodborne infections as important for veterinarians.

            "text": "The expert panel identified a broad range of KAPs which would be expected of effective One Health practitioners when diagnosing and managing zoonoses in clinical settings. This included general knowledge of zoonoses and emerging diseases, risk management and reporting practices, confidence/preparedness in diagnosing/managing zoonotic diseases, use of information sources, and cross-professional collaboration and referral. In terms of general knowledge of zoonoses, the expert panel emphasized importance of clinical aspects and epidemiology over ecological drivers. Broader understanding of disease ecology is seen by many as key to curbing the emergence of zoonoses [25] [26] [27] . The fact that this sub-topic did not rate more highly may reflect the fact that members of the expert panel viewed this topic as being less directly relevant to clinical practice or had a narrow interpretation of the phrase, 'ecological drivers'. Soliciting information in the clinical history on potential environmental exposures or ecological changes happening in the vicinity of patients/clients' residence (e.g. farmer occupation, new flying fox roosts) would seem salient to the diagnosis and risk assessment of zoonoses in clinical settings. Indeed Rabinowitz and Conti in their book 'Human-Animal Medicine' [16] urge both human and animal health professionals to adopt a 'shared Table 2 Topics and sub-topics identified by members of the expert panel during Phase One of the Delphi survey. risk' approach when considering the environmental factors driving emergence of many zoonotic diseases. Members of the expert panel were more likely to rate correct use of PPE in practice as extremely important to the One Health effectiveness of veterinarians compared to that of GPs. This sub-topic was also identified as a priority area for future research with veterinarians specifically. Australian veterinarians are at risk of exposure to a number of potentially fatal or debilitating chronic zoonotic diseases. Recent studies in both Australia and overseas have shown that many veterinarians do not use effective PPE [28] [29] [30] , and the opinion of the expert panel suggests that this is still an area of concern. It is unclear why members of the expert panel did not place the same importance on PPE for GPs, given that in recent history GPs in Australia and elsewhere have also had significant risk of exposure to EIDs of zoonotic origin transmitted in healthcare settings, such as Ebola and SARS. Studies have suggested that GPs too have insufficient awareness and access to appropriate PPE [31] [32] [33] . Perhaps this perception is based on the fact that the risk of exposure to debilitating or fatal zoonotic diseases for GPs is lower and episodic rather than constant. Nonetheless, inadequate knowledge and access to appropriate PPE may leave many under-resourced and underprepared, especially in the face of an EID.",

Q fever and ABLV scored amongst the top five diseases/agents for both GPs and veterinarians. For veterinarians, Hendra virus, anthrax and B. suis also scored highly, while for GPs, gastrointestinal/foodborne infections, influenza and local vectorborne diseases were deemed most important. Q fever is the most common direct zoonosis in Australia, with outbreaks being reported in both rural and urban areas, including in veterinary practices [39] [40] [41] [42] . These incidents have revealed inadequate workplace health and safety and biosecurity protocols in many Australian veterinary practices, where Q fever vaccination is advised [41, 42] . ABLVwhich is similar to rabies virus and is unique to Australiahas resulted in three human fatalities in Australia, none of which have been veterinarians.

Queensland and northern New South Wales. Anthrax appears rarely in Australia, however there were outbreaks in Queensland and Victoria at the time the survey was conducted [45, 46] which may have resulted in its elevated importance in this study. Reports of B. suis in hunting dogs have increased since 2011, especially in New South Wales [47] . Despite no marked increases in human cases [48] , the emerging occupational risk to veterinary personnel and clients warrants its high ranking. Many of the zoonoses which were not prioritised are a more likely infection risk to veterinarians and their patients and clients (e.g. ringworm, hookworm). These may have been perceived as less important because they have a lower impact clinically or there may be an assumption that veterinarians are already well conversant in these diseases. Given the high number of disease notifications for gastrointestinal/ foodborne infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, the high incidence of local vector-borne diseases such as Ross River fever, as well as the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 and high numbers of influenza cases in 2017 [48] , it is understandable that these diseases were seen by the expert panel as important areas for GPs to be knowledgeable of. However, GPs may not consider the potential zoonotic origin of these infections, especially in the case of gastrointestinal infections [49, 50] . This can have implications for risk management of the patient and their contacts if the illness has been contracted from an animal.",

In their 2016 paper, Ng and Sargeant [51] looked at prioritization of zoonoses with respect to their public health impact and concluded that health professionals' priorities were influenced by disease criteria related to their particular patients (i.e. humans or animals). In our study, examination of summative scores for diseases revealed fairly good agreement between experts with and without a veterinary background, with some exceptions. In particular, experts with a veterinary background were more inclined to rank disease caused by C. psittaci in the top five zoonotic diseases of importance to GPs. This disease was recently identified as a cause of abortion storms in horses in Australia and was the putative cause of respiratory illness in veterinary staff which attended the animals [52] . This may explain the higher ranking of this disease by experts with a veterinary background.",

While this study achieved an acceptable number of experts to ensure validity using this mode of survey [18, 20, 21] , a larger number of respondents would have permitted a more robust statistical approach, especially when comparing responses between groups. Despite invitations being sent to even numbers of experts from veterinary and non-veterinary backgrounds, approximately 2/3 of responses were from experts with a veterinary background. This may be due to the fact that, historically, veterinarians have had more engagement with One Health [5, 35] , and may be more likely to see the benefits of a One Health approach. The lower response rate from experts with a non-veterinary background may mean that the responses may not be an accurate reflection of the opinions of this cohort. This does not appear to have biased the final results however as in the majority of areas there was reasonable agreement between experts of different backgrounds. Interestingly, a recent Australian Delphi survey [1] that focussed on One Health priorities for EID outbreak responses had a more even distribution of veterinary and non-veterinary participant groups. This may be because stakeholders with a non-veterinary background are more engaged with One Health concepts at a policy rather than clinical level. An improved level of response may have been achieved with a different study technique such as focus groups or interviews, or greater personal engagement at the invitation stage.",
