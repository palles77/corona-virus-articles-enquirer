The study design was consistent with the NTP 13-week toxicity studies. Harlan Sprague Dawley (HSD) rats and their offspring, and B6C3F1/N mice were assigned to control (unenriched) and enriched experimental groups. Body weight, food and water consumption, behavioral observations, fecal content, clinical pathology, gross pathology, organ weights, and histopathology were evaluated. Enriched male mice and male and female rats exhibited decreased feed intake without a subsequent decrease in body weight; this may have been the result of the nesting material reducing the effect of cold stress thereby allowing for more efficient use of feed. There were statistical differences in some hematological parameters, however these were not considered physiologically relevant since all values were within the normal range. Gross pathology and histopathological findings were background changes and were not considered enrichment-related. Nesting material and shelters were used frequently and consistently and allowed animals to display species typical behavior. There was no significant impact on commonly measured endpoints in HSD rats and B6C3F1/N mice given enrichment devices.",

Environmental enrichment is defined as \"a measure and/or resources designed to promote expression of natural, species typical behaviors\". The goals of environmental enrichment include decreasing abnormal behaviors and providing a certain degree of control over its environment to the animal, hence improving animal welfare through the reduction of stress (Brinkman, 1996) . Multiple studies have shown that environmental enrichment can lead to improvements in animal welfare such as decreased maladaptive behaviors and decreased aggression (Van der Meer et al. 2004 ). According to The Guide, investigators, animal care staff, and IACUC members are encouraged to design enrichment programs after consulting current and applicable literature. Environmental enrichment is a variable that must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with each experiment and constructed on the specific needs of the program (NRC, 2011) .",

Users of research animals have a responsibility to address enrichment from an animal welfare perspective. There are challenges associated with adding environmental enrichment to an animal study, including, 1) enrichment devices may introduce a potential variable, 2) the composition of the enrichment device may impact the study, 3) the physiological effects on the study animals, and 4) the practicality of implementing devices in a research program. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the researchers, veterinary team, and IACUCs to test and support environmental enrichment that is deemed appropriate for the facility and study. There is ample literature on the use and comparison of various enrichment devices in non-regulatory rodent studies, thus increasing the likelihood of finding enrichment suitable for the needs of a specific regulatory study (Dean, 1999) .",

Currently in NTP studies, animals are provided social enrichment through group housing of male rats, female rats, and female mice in feed, water and gavage studies. Male mice and pregnant rats are housed individually and have visual and olfactory contact with conspecifics. Animals used for inhalation and dermal studies are housed individually as well. Our study evaluated the impact of the use of nesting material (Crink-l'nest\u2122, The Andersons, Inc., Maumee, OH) in mouse studies, and nesting material (Crink-l'nest\u2122) or rectangular polycarbonate shelters (Rat Retreats\u2122, Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ) for pregnant dams and their weanlings in rat studies.

This has been observed in several other studies evaluating the effects of enrichment on food and water intake ( Van de Weerd et al., 1997; Olsson et al., 2002; Watson, 1993) . Watson et al. (1993) observed similar results in individually housed mice. The insulation of the nesting material may have allowed singly housed male mice to maintain thermoregulation and reduce heat loss to the environment. Although the present study did not directly measure body temperature, studies on thermoregulation of rodents have shown that nesting material may decrease heat loss and help mice maintain normal core body temperature (Gaskill et al. 2011) . The Guide recommends 68-79\u00b0 F as the dry bulb macro environmental temperature for housing rodents, however, the preferred temperature for mice is approximately 86\u00b0F (Gaskill et al., 2011) . It could be speculated that if nesting material were not available, the energy conserved by the enriched mice would have been used to maintain their core temperature. The nesting material as enrichment is a means for rodents to control chronic cold stress, which potentially could be a variable in experimental outcomes (Sesti-Costa et al. 2012; Kokolus et al. 2013; Morgan et al. 2007 ). Nesting material may be a way to mitigate this variable. The body weight of the unenriched and enriched groups of male mice showed no significant difference. The enriched male mice had less feed intake but were able to maintain a body weight comparable to that of their unenriched counterpart. This finding suggests that the nesting material may have enhanced the food conversion by the enriched mice as noted by other investigators .",

Kinder (1927) and Boice (1977) demonstrated that rats build nests in response to temperature decreases. It has been shown that rat nest building activity is inversely related to the temperature of the housing environment; nest building was seen as independent of parturition as non-pregnant rats built nests when the material is available (Kinder, 1927) . Several studies have shown that nest building by rats is not limited to females and is a part of their normal species typical behavior (Kinder 1927; Jegstrup et al. 2005; Manser et al. 1998b) .

In scenarios where both nesting and shelters were an option, rats combined and used both enrichment devices. (Masser et al., 1998a; Patterson-Kane et al., 2001) .

Mice given paper strips built better nests than counterparts provided facial tissue or both substrates.

Mice build nests of varying complexity based on strain differences or genetic modification. Lactating and pregnant C57BL/6J mice built more complex nests than DBA/2J mice (Bond et al., 2002) . C57BL/ 6JJmsSlc mice built nests faster but with lower walls than JF1/Ms mice (Okayama et al. 2015) ; Genetically modified Shn-2 KO mice, exhibited impaired nest building behavior (Takao et al., 2013) . In the present study, the singly housed male mice not provided nesting material was observed making shallow concavities in the bedding resembling a nest. The mice exhibited the gathering behavior associated with nest building; gathering the bedding material around themselves.

In addition, rats provided more natural material built more complex nests . During the observation periods, dams and weanling rats were seen consuming small amounts of bedding and nesting material and both were present in their fecal samples. The shelter material did not appear gnawed and none was found in the feces. It has been reported that older rats exposed to nesting material tend to ingest the material most likely due to the lack of exposure at a young age. More ingestion of nesting material was seen in the rats exposed for the first time at an older age (after weaning age). Adult rats in their study ate both the naturalistic and nonnaturalistic nesting material . The dams in our study had not been previously exposed to nesting material and this is most likely the reason for our observations. Our experience with rat pups differed from that of other authors. The ingestion of nesting material by the rat weanlings could possibly be a behavior learned from observation of the dams. There are no cited references of rats eating bedding known to us, however this activity has been noted anecdotally and has been reported to be quite common in the pet rats (Tayy, 2007) .",

Although there is not a large body of literature regarding platelet responses to stress, it has been reported that platelets are not sensitive to stress (Everds et al., 2013) . In female mice, there was a small increase in the WBC count that was reflected by proportional increases in lymphocyte and neutrophil counts. All counts were within the reported biological variability for female B6C3F1/N mice (NTP, 1990) . Furthermore, the lymphocyte and neutrophil distribution percentages were unaffected suggesting that the lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were increased solely due to the apparent increase in the WBC count. In general, WBC changes related to chronic stress include decreases in lymphocyte counts and variably changed neutrophil counts (Everds et al., 2013) . These effects did not occur in the present study and the minor WBC changes that occurred were not considered related to enrichment. This effect has also been reported in rats housed in enriched environments. Thus, the statistically significant hematological changes in male and female mice noted above were not considered biologically important or related to enrichment.",

            "text": "There was an apparent increase in fecal corticosterone in female mice and plasma corticosterone of male mice provided enrichment devices. The increased fecal corticosterone concentration in exposed female mice was small and well within the range of normal values that have been reported for mice (Touma et al., 2004) . Since the female mice were group housed, fecal sampling was performed on a cage basis, thus, reducing the overall number of samples (n = 8) collected from females compared to the singly housed male mice which were sampled on an individual basis (n = 40) and there were no differences in the fecal corticosterone concentration. Furthermore, since sampling by cage did not permit equivalent representation of all animals housed as a group, pre-analytical variability (and possibly, bias) introduced by the sample collection and processing could have affected the outcomes of either or both the enriched and un-enriched groups (especially considering the small \"n\"). Thus, the higher fecal corticosterone observed in the enriched female mice is of questionable significance and was not considered related to enrichment. The higher plasma corticosterone of enriched male mice may reflect a response to enrichment. The increase was not of large magnitude and, in general, the plasma values for the un-enriched males were similar to previously reported values for male B6C3F1/N mice (Islam and Pestka, 2003) . Several reports have indicated that rats housed in enriched environments demonstrate \"eustress\" or \"good stress\" that is characterized by generally higher corticosterone values compared to age-matched, traditionally-housed animals (Marashi et al., 2003; Benaroya-Milshtein et al., 2004; Moncek et al., 2004; Konkle et al., 2010) . The female mice demonstrated no effect in the plasma corticosterone concentrations. However, the females did have approximately 3fold higher plasma corticosterone concentrations than the males. This was expected and may be related higher corticosteroid-binding protein (a.k.a., transcortin) concentrations in females compared to males (Tinnikov, 1999) .",

Thermal stress is a progressively trending area of research. Maloney et al. (2014) provides a detailed review on the effect of thermal stress on the mouse model. The review addresses the concern that mice housed below their lower critical temperature have abnormal cardiovascular physiology, metabolism, longevity, and disease development. Gordon et al. (2014) , gives a through review of the effects of thermal stress on toxicant absorption and metabolism by mammals. The latter author emphasizes that environmental temperature should not be the only consideration when studying toxicants but the thermoregulation by mammalian models. Both authors highlight the important concern of using thermally stressed mouse models when extrapolating data for use in humans and the need for additional research. In conclusion, the present study showed that the nesting material and shelters did not adversely impact endpoints commonly measured during the conduct of NTP studies. The only consistent effects appeared to be increased intake in food by the unenriched male mice and rat weanlings, with no differences in weight. The histopathological evaluations of the animals showed no lesions of consequence and hematological values were within the normal range. Overall, the effects of the enrichment were positive in light of promoting normal behavior and improved thermoregulation leading to reduced physiological stress. We recommend the use of these devices for enrichment during the conduct of NTP studies. Feed consumption between the three groups of weanling male rats showed a statistically significant difference on weeks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12. The unenriched group consistently consumed more feed during the course of the study. (mean +/\u2212 one standard error) Figure 1C .",
