The fear and anxiety that arise with the occurrence of any infectious disease are even greater in the situation of the breastfeeding mother-infant dyad. Uncertainty and lack of knowledge often lead to proscribing against breastfeeding out of fear, which then deprives the infant of the potential protective, nutritional, and emotional benefits of breastfeeding exactly at the time when they are most needed (see the discussion of immunologic benefits of human milk in Chapter 5). Decisions concerning breastfeeding in a mother with an infectious illness should balance the potential benefits of breastfeeding versus the known or estimated risk for the infant acquiring a clinically significant infection via breastfeeding and the potential severity of the infection.",

The first step is to establish the occurrence of a specific infection (clinically or immunologically evident) in a mother and demonstrate the persistence of the infectious agent such that it could be transmitted to the infant. Isolation or identification of the infectious agent from the colostrum, breast milk, or an infectious lesion of the breast is important but not necessarily proof of transmission to an infant. Epidemiologic evidence of transmission must be considered, including identifying characteristics of the organism that relate an isolate from an infant to the maternal isolate. Infectious organisms can reach the breast milk either by secretion in the fluid or cellular components of breast milk or by contamination of the milk at the time of or after expression. A reasonable mechanism of infection via breast milk should be evident and proved through either animal or human studies. Demonstration of a subclinical or clinically evident infection in an infant should follow these outlined steps.",

Timing of breastfeeding is important relative to the timing of maternal infection and to the presence of a pathogen in colostrum or breast milk. The duration of breastfeeding is another important variable to consider in the estimate of risk because shedding of a pathogen in breast milk may be intermittent. These considerations are only some of the variables to be taken into account, in general, to assess the risk for transmission of an infectious agent from mother to infant via breast milk or breastfeeding.

These precautions are useful most often when a mother and infant are still hospitalized. The use of such precautions within the home is not meant to limit breastfeeding. They are intended to allow breastfeeding in the majority of cases and to facilitate the continuation of breastfeeding with some additional safeguards in certain situations, after short temporary periods of stopping breastfeeding, and when to safely use expressed breast milk (see Appendix F).",

Few studies have examined \"routine\" culturing of milk and the significance of specific bacterial colony counts relative to illness in infants. The studies have been primarily concerned with premature or low-birth-weight (LBW) infants who remain hospitalized and are commonly fed via enteral tubes. A study from Canada tested 7610 samples of milk for use in 98 preterm infants. 242 The study did not identify any adverse events in the infants attributed to organisms growing in the milk samples, and routine bacteriological testing of expressed breast milk was not recommended. A study from Chicago examined gram-negative bacilli in the milk used in premature infants. 48 Samples were tested before feeding and from the nasogastric tubes during feeding. Milk samples from before feeding were less likely to contain gram-negative bacilli (36%) than milk samples from the nasogastric tubing (60%). Feeding intolerance was observed when there were more than 10 3 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL), and episodes of sepsis were identified when the bacterial counts in the milk were greater than or equal to 10 6 CFU/mL. This study recommended the routine bacteriologic testing of expressed breast milk. Another study from Arkansas focused on contamination of feeding tubes during administration of expressed breast milk or formula. 277 Ten infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were exposed to greater than 10 5 gram-negative bacteria in their feeding tubes. The three infants who were fed expressed breast milk with contamination at greater than 10 5 organisms remained well, but the seven formula-fed infants with high levels of bacterial contamination in the feeding tubes developed necrotizing enterocolitis. The gram-negative bacteria with high level contamination in the feeding tubes were either Enterobacter or Klebsiella in all cases. Many NICUs consider 10 5 to 10 6 CFU/mL as the significant bacterial count for gram-negative bacilli in breast milk that places premature and LBW infants at greater risk for infection.",

More important than hurrying to culture breast milk is the careful instruction of mothers on the proper technique for collecting expressed breast milk, storing it, and cleaning the collection unit. The reinforcement of proper technique from time to time, especially when a question of contamination arises, is equally important. Many small reports comment on the contamination of breast milk with different collection methods. Relative comparisons suggest decreasing contamination of expressed breast milk when collected by the following methods; drip milk, hand pumped milk, manual expression, modern electric pumped milk. One group from Malaysia published results showing no difference in contamination between milk collected by electric pump versus manual expression when collected in the hospital. Expressed breast milk collected at home by breast pump had higher rates of contamination with staphylococci and gram-negative bacteria. 46 Discussion continues about the need to discard the first few milliliters of milk to lower bacteria numbers in expressed breast milk without any evidence to suggest if this is truly necessary. 62, 337 No evidence shows that cleansing the breast with anything other than tap water decreases the bacterial counts in cultured expressed breast milk. 414 If an infant is directly breastfeeding, collecting milk for culture by manual expression and trying to obtain a \"midstream\" sample (as is done with \"midstream\" urine collection for culture) is appropriate. If an infant is being fed expressed breast milk, collecting and culturing the milk at different points during collection (utilizing the same technique the mother uses [manual expression, hand pump, or electric pump]) and administration is appropriate. This might include a sample from immediately after collection, another of stored expressed breast milk, and a sample of milk from the most recent infant feeding at the time the decision to culture is made.

The risk for transmission of HIV via breastfeeding is due to the volume of feedings over months (estimated at 400 to 500 feedings in the first 2 months of life) compared with the small \"dose of exposure\" from one or two \"accidental feedings.\" Transmission of HIV from a single breast milk exposure has never been documented. Immunologic components in breast milk, along with time and cold of storage, inactivate the HIV in expressed breast milk. For these reasons, the risk for transmission of HIV via expressed breast milk consumed by another child is thought to be extremely low. HTLV-I/II infection in childbearing women is uncommon except in certain geographic regions (Japan, Africa, the Caribbean, and South America). Transmission of HTLV via breast milk does occur and, like HIV, appears to be related to the volume and duration of breastfeeding. Limiting the duration of breastfeeding is effective in decreasing transmission. 407, 409, 446 Freezing and thawing expressed breast milk decreases the infectivity of HTLV-I. 11 In areas of low prevalence, a positive test in a mother should be suspected to be a false positive test, and retesting with both antibody and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing should be performed. For these reasons the transmission of HTLV-I/II via accidental expressed breast milk exposure is thought to be extremely low. Although the majority of women are CMV positive by childbearing age and CMV transmission occurs via breastfeeding, the risk for CMV in a full-term infant is low. Premature or LBW infants are at greater risk for developing disease with CMV infection. Freezing expressed breast milk (at \u221220\u00b0 C) for 3 to 5 days significantly decreases the infectivity of CMV. Here again the risk for CMV transmission from a single accidental exposure to CMV-positive expressed breast milk is extremely low.",

Many situations carry the risk for transmission of the involved organism from a mother to the infant, or vice versa; in general, however, infants are at greater risk because of such factors as inoculum size and immature immune response. As always, an infection must be accurately diagnosed in a timely manner. Empiric therapy and initial infection control precautions should begin promptly based on the clinical symptoms and the most likely etiologic agents. When dealing with a maternal infection, clarifying the possible modes of transmission and estimating the relative risk for transmission to the infant are essential first steps to decision-making about isolating a mother from her infant and the appropriateness of continuing breastfeeding or providing expressed breast milk. Breastfeeding infrequently is contraindicated in specific maternal infections. 243 Often the question of isolation and interruption of breastfeeding arises when symptoms of fever, pain, inflammation, or other manifestations of illness first develop in a mother and the diagnosis is still in doubt. A clinical judgment must be made based on the site of infection, probable organisms involved, possible or actual mechanisms of transmission of these organisms to the infant, estimated virulence of the organism, and likely susceptibility of the infant. Additionally, by the time the illness is clearly recognized or diagnosed in a mother, the infant has already been exposed. Given the dynamic nature of the immunologic benefits of breast milk, continuation of breastfeeding at the time of diagnosis or illness in a mother can provide the infant protection rather than continued exposure in most illnesses. Stopping breastfeeding is rarely necessary. Many situations associated with maternal fever do not require separation of mother and infant, such as engorgement of the breasts, atelectasis, localized nonsuppurative phlebitis, or urinary tract infections.",

Infant botulism is distinguished from food-borne botulism from improperly preserved food containing the toxin and from wound botulism from spores entering the wound. Infant botulism occurs when the spores of Clostridium botulinum germinate and multiply in the gut and produce the botulinal toxin in the GI tract. 17 The toxin binds presynaptically at the neuromuscular junction, preventing acetylcholine release. The clinical picture is a descending, symmetric flaccid paralysis. Not every individual who has C. botulinum identified in the stool experiences a clinical illness. The age of infants seems to relate to their susceptibility to illness. The illness is mainly in children younger than 12 months of age; the youngest patient described in the literature was 6 days old. 17 Most children become ill between 6 weeks and 6 months of age. The onset of illness seems to occur earlier in formula-fed infants compared with breastfed infants. When a previously healthy infant younger than 6 months of age develops constipation, then weakness and difficulty sucking, swallowing, crying, or breathing, botulism is a likely diagnosis.

In general the acid stools (pH 5.1 to 5.4) of human milk fed infants encourage Bifidobacterium species. Few facultative anaerobic bacteria, or clostridia, existing as spores, are present in breastfed infants. In contrast, formula-fed infants have stool pHs ranging from 5.9 to 8.0, with few bifidobacteria, primarily gram-negative bacteria, especially coliforms and Bacteroides species. C. botulinum growth and toxin production decrease with declining pH and usually stops below pH 4.6. Breast milk also contains additional protective immunologic components, which purportedly have activity against botulinum toxin. 269 The relationship between the introduction of solid foods or weaning in both formula-fed and breastfed infants and the onset of botulism remains unclear. For a breastfed infant, the introduction of solid food may cause a major change in the gut with a rapid rise in the growth of enterobacteria and enterococci followed by progressive colonization by Bacteroides species, clostridia, and anaerobic streptococci. Feeding solids to formula-fed infants minimally changes the gut flora as these organisms already predominate.

            "text": "MRSA is an important pathogen worldwide. Community-acquired MRSA is different from hospital-acquired MRSA. Community-acquired MRSA is usually defined as occurring in an individual without the common predisposing variables associated with hospital-acquired MRSA, lacking a MDR phenotype (common with hospital-acquired MRSA), frequently carrying multiple exotoxin virulence factors (such as Panton-Valentine leukocidin toxin), as well as carrying the smaller type IV staphylococcal cassette cartridge for the MecA gene on a chromosome (hospital-acquired MRSA carries types I-III staphylococcal cassette cartridge) and as being molecularly distinct from the common nosocomial strains of hospital-acquired MRSA. Community-acquired MRSA is most commonly associated with skin and soft tissue infections and necrotizing pneumonia and less frequently associated with endocarditis, bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, myositis, osteomyelitis, or parapneumonic effusions. Community-acquired MRSA is so common, it is now being observed in hospital outbreaks. 24, 144, 164, 358 Community-acquired MRSA transmission to infants via breast milk has been reported. 34, 144, 210, 253, 286 Premature or small-forgestational-age infants are more susceptible to and at increased risk for significant morbidity and mortality due to MRSA due in part to prolonged hospitalization, multiple courses of antibiotics, invasive procedures, and intravenous (IV) lines, their relative immune deficiency due to prematurity and illness, and altered GI tract due to different flora and decreased gastric acidity. Therefore colonization with MRSA may pose a greater risk to infants in NICUs in the long run. Full-term infants develop pustulosis, cellulitis, and soft tissue infections, but rarely has invasive disease been reported. 82, 132, 298 Fortunov et al 132 from Texas reported 126 infections in term or late-preterm previously well infants including 43 with pustulosis, 68 with celluliltis or abscesses, and 15 invasive infections. Family history of soft tissue skin infections and male sex were the only variables associated with risk for infection; cesarean delivery, breastfeeding, and circumcision were not. 132 Nguyen et al 298 reported MRSA infections in a well-infant nursery from California. The eleven cases were all in full-term boys with pustularvesicular lesions in the groin. The infections were associated with longer length of stay, lidocaine injection use in infants, maternal age older than 30 years, and circumcision. Breastfeeding was not an associated risk factor for MRSA infection. 298 The question of the role of circumcision in MRSA outbreaks was addressed by Van Howe and Robson. 426 They reported that circumcised boys are at greater risk for staphylococcal colonization and infection. 426 Others report that S. aureus carriage in infants (and subsequent infection) is most likely affected by multiple variables including infant factors (antibiotics, surgical procedures [circumcision being the most common], duration of hospital stay as a newborn), maternal factors (previous colonization, previous antibiotic usage, mode of delivery, length of stay), and environmental factors (MRSA in the family or hospital, nursery stay versus rooming-in, hand hygiene).* Gerber et al 147 from the Chicago area published a consensus statement for the management of MRSA outbreaks in the NICU. The recommendations, which were strongly supported by experimental, clinical, and epidemiologic data, included using a waterless, alcohol-based hand hygiene product, monitoring and enforcing hand hygiene, placing MRSA-positive infants in contact precautions with cohorting if possible, using gloves and gowns for direct contact and masks for aerosolgenerating procedures, cohorting nurses for care of MRSA-positive infants when possible, periodic screening of infants for MRSA using nares or nasopharyngeal cultures, clarifying the MRSA status of infants being transferred into the NICU, limiting overcrowding, and maintaining ongoing instruction and monitoring of health care workers in their compliance with infection control and hand hygiene procedures. Evaluation of the outbreak could include screening of health care workers and environmental surfaces to corroborate epidemiologic data and laboratory molecular analysis of the MRSA strains if indicated epidemiologically. The use of mupirocin or other decolonizing procedures should be determined on an individual basis for each NICU.",

Illness produced by coagulasenegative staphylococci can be invasive and severe in high-risk neonates, but rarely in mothers. There are reports of necrotizing enterocolitis associated with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. At 2 weeks of age, for infants still in the nursery, S. epidermidis is a frequent colonizing organism at multiple sites, with colonization rates as high as 75% to 100%. Serious infections with coagulase-negative staphylococci (e.g., abscesses, IV line infection, bacteremia/sepsis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis) require effective IV therapy. Many strains are resistant to penicillin and the semisynthetic penicillins, so sensitivity testing is essential. Empiric or definitive therapy may require treatment with vancomycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, linezolid, or combinations of these for synergistic activity. Transmission of infection in association with breastfeeding appears to be no more common than with bottle feeding. As with S. aureus infection control includes contact and standard precautions. Occasionally, during presumed outbreaks, careful epidemiologic surveillance may be required, including cohorting, limiting overcrowding and understaffing, surveillance cultures of infants and nursery personnel, reemphasis of meticulous infection control techniques for all individuals entering the nursery, and, rarely, removal of colonized personnel from direct infant contact.",

Risk factors for early-onset GBS disease include delivery before 37 weeks' gestation, rupture of membranes for longer than 18 hours before delivery, intrapartum fever, heavy maternal colonization with GBS, or low concentrations of anti-GBS capsular antibody in maternal sera. 95 The common occurrence of severe GBS disease before 24 hours of age in neonates has lead to prevention strategies. Revised guidelines developed by the AAP Committees on Infectious Diseases and on the Fetus and Newborn 95 have tried to combine various variables for increased risk for GBS infection (prenatal colonization with GBS, obstetric and neonatal risk factors for early-onset disease) and provide intrapartum prophylaxis to those at high risk ( Figure 13 -1) The utilization of these guidelines and intrapartum prophylaxis across the United States has decreased the incidence of early-onset disease by approximately 80%. In 2005, the incidence of early-onset disease was 0.35 cases per 1000 live births. 95 Late-onset GBS disease is thought to be the result of transmission during delivery or in the postnatal period from maternal, hospital, or community sources. Dillon et al 112 demonstrated that 10 of 21 infants with late-onset disease were colonized at birth, but the source of colonization was unidentified in the others. Gardner et al 141 showed that only 4.3% of 46 children who were culture negative for GBS at discharge from the hospital had acquired GBS by 2 months of age. Anthony et al 15 noted that many infants are colonized with GBS, but the actual attack rate for GBS disease is low and difficult to predict.",

Some of their recommendations included confirming appropriate collection and processing procedures for GBS cultures 370 in medical facilities to decrease false-negative cultures, reviewing proper hygiene for pumping, collection, and storage of expressed breast milk with mothers, reviewing the signs and symptoms of mastitis with mothers, and utilizing banked human milk as needed instead of mother' s milk. When a breastfed infant develops late-onset GBS disease, it is appropriate to culture the milk. (See discussion of culturing breast milk earlier in this chapter.) Consider treatment of the mother to prevent reinfection if the milk is culture positive for GBS (greater than 10 4 CFU/mL), with or without clinical evidence of mastitis in the mother. Withholding the mother' s milk until it is confirmed to be culture negative for a pathogen is appropriate and should be accompanied by providing ongoing support and instruction to the mother concerning pumping and maintaining her milk supply. Serial culturing of expressed breast milk after treatment of the mother for GBS disease or colonization would be appropriate to insure the ongoing absence of a pathogen in the expressed breast milk. There are reports of reinfection of the infant from breast milk. 23, 225 Eradication of GBS mucosal colonization in the infant or the mother may be difficult. Some authors have recommended using rifampin prophylactically in both the mother and infant at the end of treatment to eradicate mucosal colonization. 23 (See Chapter 16 for management of mastitis in the mother.) A mother or infant colonized or infected with GBS should be managed with standard precautions 94 while in the hospital. Ongoing close evaluation of the infant for infection or illness and empiric therapy for GBS in the infant are appropriate until the child has remained well and cultures are subsequently negative at 72 hours. Occasionally, epidemiologic investigation in the hospital will utilize culturing medical staff and family members to detect a source of late-onset GBS disease in the nursery. This can be useful when more than one case of late-onset disease is detected with the same serotype. Cohorting in such a situation may be appropriate. Selective prophylactic therapy for colonized infants to eradicate colonization may be considered, but unlike GAS or Staphylococcus infection, GBS infection in nurseries has not been reported to cause outbreaks.

Isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol have been used safely in all three trimesters. Isoniazid and pyridoxine therapy during breastfeeding is safe, although the risk for hepatotoxicity in the mother may be a concern during the first 2 months postpartum. 391 Congenital TB is extremely rare if one considers that 7 to 8 million cases of TB occur each year worldwide and that less than 300 cases of congenital TB have been reported in the literature. As with other infectious diseases presenting in the perinatal period, distinguishing congenital infection from perinatal or postnatal TB in infants can be difficult. Postnatal TB infection in infancy typically presents with severe disease and extrapulmonary extension (meningitis, lymphadenopathy, and bone, liver, spleen involvement). Airborne transmission of TB to infants is the major mode of postnatal infection because of close and prolonged exposure in enclosed spaces, especially in their own household, to any adult with infectious pulmonary TB.

Every situation is unique, and the best approach will vary according to the specifics of the case and accepted principles of TB management. The first step in caring for the potentially exposed infant is to determine accurately the true TB status of the suspected case (mother or household contact). This prompt evaluation should include a complete history (previous TB infection or disease, previous or ongoing TB treatment, TST status, symptoms suggestive of active TB, results of most recent chest radiograph, sputum smears, or cultures), physical examination, a TST if indicated, a new chest radiograph, and mycobacterial cultures and smears of any suspected sites of infection. All household contacts should be evaluated promptly, including history and TST with further evaluation as indicated. 68 Continued risk to the infant can occur from infectious household contacts who have not been effectively evaluated and treated.",

Congenital infection of infants, postnatal infection of premature infants, and infection of immunodeficient individuals represent the most serious forms of this infection in children. The time at which the virus infects the fetus or infant and the presence or absence of antibodies against CMV from the mother are important determinants of the severity of infection and the likelihood of significant sequelae (congenital infection syndrome, deafness, chorioretinitis, abnormal neurodevelopment, learning disabilities). 234 About 1% of all infants are born excreting CMV at birth, and approximately 5% of these congenitally infected infants will demonstrate evidence of infection at birth (approximately five symptomatic cases per 10,000 live births). Approximately 15% of infants born after primary infection in a pregnant woman will manifest at least one sequela of prenatal infection. 96 Various studies have detected that 3% to 28% of pregnant women have CMV in cervical cultures and that 4% to 5% of pregnant women have CMV in their urine. 120, 172 Perinatal infection certainly occurs through contact with virus in these fluids but usually is not associated with clinical illness in fullterm infants.

            "text": "Postnatal infection later in infancy occurs via breastfeeding or contact with infected fluids (e.g., saliva, urine) but, again, rarely causes clinical illness in full-term infants. Seroepidemiologic studies have documented transmission of infection in infancy, with higher rates of transmission occurring in daycare centers, especially when the prevalence of CMV in the urine and saliva is high. CMV has been identified in the milk of CMV-seropositive women at varying rates (10% to 85%) using viral cultures or CMV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) PCR. 172, 301, 397, 430 CMV is more often identified in the breast milk of seropositive mothers than in vaginal fluids, urine, and saliva. The CMV isolation rate from colostrum is lower than that from mature milk. 172, 396 The reason for the large degree of variability in identification of CMV in breast milk in these studies probably relates to the intermittent nature of reactivation and excretion of the virus in addition to the variability, frequency, and duration of sampling of breast milk in the different studies. Some authors have hypothesized that the difference in isolation rates between breast milk and other fluids is caused by viral reactivation in cells (leukocytes or monocytes) in the breast leading to \"selective\" excretion in breast milk. 301 Vochem et al 430 reported that the rate of virolactia was greatest at 3 to 4 weeks postpartum, and Yeager et al 455 reported significant virolactia between 2 and 12 weeks postpartum. Antibodies (e.g., secretory IgA) to CMV are present in breast milk, along with various cytokines and other proteins (e.g., lactoferrin). These may influence virus binding to cells, but they do not prevent transmission of infection.* Several studies have documented increased rates of postnatal CMV infection in breastfed infants (50% to 69%) compared with bottle-fed infants (12% to 27%) observed through the first year of life 120, 281, 397, 430 In these same studies, full-term infants who acquired CMV infection postnatally were only rarely mildly symptomatic at the time of seroconversion or documented viral excretion. Also, no evidence of late sequelae from CMV was found in these infants.",

            "text": "Postnatal exposure of susceptible infants to CMV, including premature infants without passively acquired maternal antibodies against CMV, infants born to CMV-seronegative mothers, and immunodeficient infants, can cause significant clinical illness (pneumonitis, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia).* In one study of premature infants followed up to 12 months, Vochem et al 430 found CMV transmission in 17 of 29 infants (59%) exposed to CMV virolactia and breastfed compared with no infants infected of 27 exposed to breast milk without CMV. No infant was given CMV-seropositive donor milk or blood. Five of the 12 infants who developed CMV infection after 2 months of age had mild signs of illness, including transient neutropenia, and only one infant had a short increase in episodes of apnea and a period of thrombocytopenia. Five other premature infants with CMV infection before 2 months of age had acute illness, including sepsis-like symptoms, apnea with bradycardia, hepatitis, leukopenia, and prolonged thrombocytopenia. 430 Vollmer et al 431 followed premature infants with early postnatal CMV infection acquired through breast milk for 2 to 4.5 years to assess neurodevelopment and hearing function. None of the children had sensorineural hearing loss. There was no difference between the 22 CMV-infected children and 22 matched premature control CMV-negative infants in terms of neurologic, speech and language, or motor development. 431 Neuberger et al 296 examined the symptoms and neonatal outcome of CMV infection transmitted via human milk in premature infants in a case-control fashion; 40 CMV-infected premature infants were compared with 40 CMV-negative matched premature infants. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and cholestasis were associated with CMV infection in these infants. No other serious effects or illnesses were found directly associated with the infection including intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, duration of mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy, duration of hospital stay or weight, gestational age, or head circumference at the time of discharge. Exposure of CMV-seronegative or premature infants to CMV-positive milk (donor or natural mother' s) should be avoided. 379 Various methods of inactivating CMV in breast milk have been reported, including Holder pasteurization, freezing (\u221220\u00b0 C for 3 days), and brief high temperature (72\u00b0 C for 10 seconds). 120, 135, 155, 393, 455 One small, prospective study suggests that freezing breast milk at \u221220\u00b0C for 72 hours protects premature infants from CMV infection via breast milk. Sharland et al 379 reported on 18 premature infants (less than 32 weeks) who were uninfected at birth and exposed to breast milk from their CMV seropositive mothers. Only one of 18 (5%) infants became positive for CMV at 62 days of life, and this infant was clinically asymptomatic. This transmission rate is considerably lower than others reported in the literature. CMVseronegative and leukocyte-depleted blood products were used routinely. Banked breast milk was pasteurized and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C for various time periods and maternal expressed breast milk was frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C before use whenever possible. The infants received breast milk for a median of 34 days (range 11 to 74 days) and they were observed for a median of 67 days (range 30 to 192 days). Breast milk samples pre-or postfreezing were not analyzed by PCR or culture for the presence of cytomegalovirus. 379 Buxmann et al 57 demonstrated no transmission of CMV in 23 premature infants receiving thawed frozen breast milk until 33 weeks (gestational age + postnatal age) (less than or equal to 31 weeks gestational age) born to 19 mothers who were CMV-IgG negative. CMV infection was found in five premature infants of 35 infants born to 29 mothers who were CMV-IgG positive and who provided breast milk for their infants. Three of the five children remained asymptomatic. One child development a respirator-dependent pneumonia and the second developed an upper respiratory tract infection and thrombocytopenia in association with their CMV infections. 57 Yasuda et al 454 reported on 43 preterm infants (median gestational age 31 weeks) demonstrating a peak in CMV DNA copies, detected by a real-time PCR assay, in breast milk at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum. Thirty of the 43 infants received CMV DNA-positive breast milk. Three of the 30 had CMV DNA detected in their sera, but none of the three had symptoms suggestive of CMV infection. Much of the breast milk had been stored at \u221220\u00b0 C before feeding, which the authors propose is the probable reason for less transmission in this cohort. 454 Lee et al 248 reported on the use of maternal milk frozen at \u221220\u00b0C for a minimum of 24 hours before feeding to premature infants in a NICU; 23 infants had CMV-seropositive mothers and 39 infants had CMV-seronegative mothers. Two infants developed CMV infection, which was symptomatic. They were both fed frozen thawed milk from CMV-seropositive mothers. 248 Others have reported individual cases of CMV infection in premature infants despite freezing and thawing breast milk. 268, 314 Simple freezing and thawing of breast milk does not completely prevent transmission of CMV to premature infants. The efficacy of freezing and thawing breast milk for varying lengths of time to prevent CMV infection in premature infants has not been studied prospectively in a randomized controlled trial. Eleven of 36 neonatal units in Sweden (27 of which have their own milk banks) freeze maternal milk to reduce the risk for CMV transmission to premature infants. 314 A prominent group of neonatologists and pediatric infectious disease experts in California who recognize the significant benefits of providing human milk to premature and LBW infants recommend screening mothers of premature infants for CMV IgG at delivery and, when an infant' s mother is CMV IgG positive at delivery, using either pasteurized banked human milk or frozen then thawed maternal breast milk for premature infants until they reach the age of 32 weeks. 445 In consideration of the low rates of CMV virolactia in colostrum 169, 397 and the predominant occurrence of virolactia between 2 and 12 weeks (peak at 3 to 4 weeks) postpartum, 430,455 they reasonably propose beginning colostrum and breast milk feedings for all infants until the maternal CMV serologic screening is complete. They appropriately recommend close observation and follow-up of premature infants older than 3 weeks of age for signs, symptoms, and laboratory changes of CMV infection until discharge from the hospital. 445 CMV-seropositive mothers can safely breastfeed their full-term infants because, despite a higher rate of CMV infection than in formula-fed infants observed through the first year of life, infection in this situation is not associated with significant clinical illness or sequelae.",

PCR and DNA hybridization studies have detected EBV in the cervix and in breast milk. One study, which identified EBV DNA in breast milk cells in more than 40% of women donating milk to a breast milk bank, demonstrated that only 17% had antibody to EBV (only IgG, no IgM). 204 Another study examining serologic specimens from breastfed and bottle-fed infants showed similar seroprevalence of EBV at 12 to 23 months of age (36/66 [54.5%] and 24/43 [55.8%]) in the breastfed and bottle-fed children, respectively. 236 The question of the timing of EBV infection and the subsequent immune response and clinical disease produced requires continued study. Differences exist among the clinical syndromes that manifest at different ages. Infants and young children are asymptomatic, have illness not recognized as related to EBV, or have mild episodes of illness, including fever, lymphadenopathy, rhinitis and cough, hepatosplenomegaly, or rash. Adolescents or young adults who experience primary EBV infection more often demonstrate infectious mononucleosis syndrome or are asymptomatic. Chronic fatigue syndrome is more common in adolescents and young adults. Burkitt lymphoma, observed primarily in Africa, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, seen in southeast Asia, where primary EBV infection usually occurs in young children, are tumors associated with early EBV infection. 246 These tumors are related to \"chronic\" EBV infection and tend to occur in individuals with persistently high antibody titers to EBV viral capsid antigen and early antigen. The questions of why these tumors occur with much greater frequency in these geographic areas and what cofactors (including altered immune response to infection associated with coinfections, immune escape by EBV leading to malignancy, or increased resistance to apoptosis secondary to EBV gene mutations) may contribute to their development remain unanswered. 21, 289 It also remains unknown to what degree breast milk could be a source of early EBV infection compared with other sources of EBV infection in an infant' s environment. Similar to the situation of postnatal transmission of CMV in immunocompetent infants, clinically significant illness rarely is associated with primary EBV infection in infants. More data concerning the pathogenesis of EBV-associated tumors should be obtained before proscribing against breastfeeding is warranted, especially in areas where these tumors are common but the protective benefits of breastfeeding are high. In areas where Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma are uncommon, EBV infection in mother or infant is certainly not a contraindication to breastfeeding.",

The first issue is determining the etiology of the hepatitis, which then allows for an informed discussion of risk to the fetus/infant. The differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis includes (1) common causes of hepatitis, such as hepatitis A, B, C, and D; (2) , IgM anti-HBcAg, anti-HCV) as the initial diagnostic tests. Simultaneous consideration of other etiologies of acute liver dysfunction is appropriate depending on a patient' s history. If the initial diagnostic tests are all negative, subsequent additional testing for anti-hepatitis D virus (HDV), HCV RNA, hepatis G virus (HGV) RNA, anti-hepatis E virus (HEV), or HEV RNA may be necessary. If initial testing reveals positive HBsAg, testing for anti-HDV, HBeAg, and HBV DNA is appropriate. These additional tests are useful in defining the prognosis for a mother and the risk for infection to an infant. During the diagnostic evaluation, it is appropriate to discuss with the mother or parents the theoretic risk for transmitting infectious agents that cause hepatitis via breastfeeding. The discussion should include an evaluation of the positive and negative effects of suspending or continuing breastfeeding until the exact etiologic diagnosis is determined. The relative risk for transmission of infection to an infant can be estimated and specific preventive measures provided for the infant (Table 13-2) .",

Chronic HBV infection occurs in up to 90% of infants infected via perinatal and vertical transmission and in 30% of children infected between 1 to 5 years of age. Given the increased risk for significant sequelae from chronic infection (chronic active hepatitis, chronic persistent hepatitis, cirrhosis, primary hepatocellular carcinoma), prevention of HBV infection in infancy is crucial. Transmission of HBV is usually through blood or body fluids (stool, semen, saliva, urine, cervical secretions). 94 Vertical transmission either transplacentally or perinatally during delivery has been well described throughout the world. Vertical transmission rates in areas where HBV is endemic (Taiwan and Japan) are high, whereas transmission to infants from HBV carrier mothers in other areas where HBV carrier rates are low is uncommon. 399 Transmission of HBV to infants occurs in up to 50% of infants when the mothers are acutely infected immediately before, during, or soon after pregnancy. 462 HBsAg is found in breast milk, but transmission by this route is not well documented. Beasley 31 and Beasley et al 32 demonstrated that although breast milk transmission is possible, seroconversion rates are no different between breastfed and nonbreastfed infants in a long-term follow-up study of 147 HBsAg-positive mothers. Hill et al 176 followed 101 breastfed infants and 268 formula-fed infants born to women who were chronically HBsAg positive. All infants received hepatitis B immunoglobulin at birth and a full series of hepatitis B vaccine. None of the breastfed infants and nine of the formulafed infants were positive for HBsAg after completion of the HBV vaccine series. Breastfeeding had occurred for a mean of 4.9 months (range 2 weeks to 1 year). Transmission, when it does happen, probably occurs during labor and delivery. Another report from China followed 230 infants born to HBsAg-positive women. The infants received appropriate dosing and timing of HBIG and HBV vaccine. At 1 year of age, anti-HBs antibody was present in 90.9% of the breastfed infants and 90.3% of the bottle-fed infants. 437 Risk factors associated with immunoprophylaxis failure against vertical transmission of HBV include HBeAg-seropositive mothers and elevated HBV DNA \"viral loads\" in the mothers. 392 In 2009 the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases stated that \"that breastfeeding of the infant by a HBsAg-positive mother poses no additional risk for acquisition of HBV infection by the infant with appropriate administration of hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG.\" 96 Screening of all pregnant women for HBV infection is an essential first step to preventing vertical transmission. Universal HBV vaccination at birth and during infancy, with administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) immediately after birth to infants of HBsAg-positive mothers, prevents HBV transmission in more than 95% of cases. Breastfeeding by HBsAg-positive women is not contraindicated, but immediate administration of HBIG and HBV vaccine should occur. Two subsequent doses of vaccine should be given at appropriate intervals and dosages for the specific HBV vaccine product. This decreases the small theoretic risk for HBV transmission from breastfeeding to almost zero.",

Sequelae of chronic HCV infection are similar to those associated with chronic HBV infection. Bortolotti et al 47 The two commonly identified mechanisms of transmission of HCV are transfusions of blood or blood products and IV drug use. However, other routes of transmission exist because HCV infection occurs even in the absence of obvious direct contact with significant amounts of blood. Other body fluids contaminated with blood probably serve as sources of infection. Transmission through sexual contact occurs infrequently and probably requires additional contributing factors, such as coinfection with other sexually transmitted agents or high viral loads in serum and other body fluids. Studies of transmission in households without other risk factors have demonstrated either low rates of transmission or no transmission.",

In mothers with unknown HIV status or known HIV infection, the rates of vertical transmission were 4% to 100%, whereas the rates varied between 0% and 42% in known HIV-negative mothers. 113 These same studies suggest that maternal coinfection with HIV, HCV genotype, active maternal liver disease, and the serum titer of maternal HCV RNA may be associated with increased rates of vertical transmission. 263, 307, 461 The correlation between HCV viremia, the HCV viral load in a mother, and vertical transmission of HCV is well documented. 288, 355, 406, 456 The clinical significance and risk for liver disease after vertical transmission of HCV are still unknown. The timing of HCV infection in vertical transmission is also unknown. In utero transmission has been suggested by some studies, 125 whereas intrapartum or postpartum transmission was proposed by Ohto et al 308 when they documented the absence of HCV RNA in the cord blood of neonates who later became HCV RNA positive at 1 to 2 months of age. More recently, Gibb et al 150 reported two pieces of data supporting the likelihood of intrapartum transmission as the predominant time of vertical transmission: (a) low sensitivity of PCR for HCV RNA testing in the first month of life with a marked increase in sensitivity after that for diagnosing HCV infection in infants and (b) a lower transmission risk for elective cesarean delivery (without prolonged rupture of membranes) compared with vaginal or emergency cesarean delivery. 150 Another group, McMenamin et al, 275 analyzed vertical transmission in 559 mother-infant pairs. The overall vertical transmission rate was 4.1% (18/441), with another 118 infants not tested or lost to follow-up. Comparison of the vertical transmission rate was no different for vaginal delivery or emergency cesarean in labor versus planned cesarean (4.2% vs. 3.0%). This held true even when mothers had hepatitis C RNA detected antenatally (7.2% vs. 5.3%). The authors did not support planned cesarean delivery to decrease vertical transmission of hepatitis C infection. No prospective, controlled trials of cesarean versus vaginal delivery and the occurrence of vertical hepatitis C transmission are available.",

The infection occurs as either an acute coinfection of HBV and HDV or a superinfection of HBV carriers. This \"double\" infection results in more frequent fulminant hepatitis and chronic hepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis. The virus uses its own HBV RNA (circular, negative-strand RNA) with an antigen, HDAg, surrounded by the surface antigen of HBV, HBsAg. HDV is transmitted in the same way as HBV, especially through the exchange of blood and body fluids. HDV infection is uncommon where the prevalence of HBV is low. In areas where HBV is endemic, the prevalence of HDV is highly variable. HDV is common in tropical Africa and South America as well as in Greece and Italy but is uncommon in the Far East and in Alaskan Inuit despite the endemic occurrence of HBV in these areas. 390 Transmission of HDV has been reported to occur from household contacts and, rarely, through vertical transmission. No data are available on transmission of HDV by breastfeeding. HDV infection can be prevented by blocking infection with HBV; therefore HBIG and HBV vaccine are the best protection. In addition to HBIG and HBV vaccine administration to the infant of a mother infected with both HBV and HDV, discussion with the mother or parents should include the theoretic risk for HBV and HDV transmission through breastfeeding. As with HBV, once HBIg and HBV vaccine have been given to the infant, the risk for HBV or HDV infection from breastfeeding is negligible. Therefore breastfeeding after an informed discussion with the parents is acceptable.",

            "text": "Hepatitis G virus (HGV) has recently been confirmed as a cause of NANBH distinct from hepatitis viruses A through E. Several closely related genomes of HGV, currently named GBV-A, -B, and -C, appear to be related to HCV, the pestiviruses, and the flaviviruses. Epidemiologically, HGV is most often associated with transfusion of blood, although studies have identified nontransfusion-related cases. HGV genomic RNA has been detected in some patients with acute and chronic hepatitis and a small number of patients with fulminant hepatitis. GBV-C/HGV has also been found in some patients with inflammatory bile duct lesions, but the pathogenicity of this virus is unconfirmed. HGV RNA has been detected in 1% to 3% of healthy blood donors in the United States. 8 Feucht et al 128 described maternal-to-infant transmission of HGV in three of nine children. Two of the three mothers were coinfected with HIV and the third with HCV. None of these infants developed signs of liver disease. Neither the timing nor the mode of transmission was clarified. Lin et al 255 reported no HGV transmission in three mother-infant pairs after cesarean delivery and discussed transplacental spread via blood as the most likely mode of HGV infection in vertical transmission. Wejstal et al 442 reported on perinatal transmission of HGV to 12 of 16 infants born to HGV viremic mothers, identified by PCR. HGV did not appear to cause hepatitis in the children. 442 Fischler et al 130 followed eight children born to HGV-positive mothers and found only one to be infected with HGV. That child remained clinically well, while his twin, also born by cesarean delivery and breastfed, remained HGV negative for 3 years of observation. Five of the other six children were breastfed for variable periods without evidence of HGV infection. Ohto et al 309 examined HGV mother-to-infant transmission. Of 2979 pregnant Japanese women who were screened, 32 were identified as positive for GBV-C/HGV RNA by PCR; 26 of 34 infants born to the 32 HGV positive women were shown to be HGV RNA positive. Reportedly, none of the infants demonstrated a clinical picture of hepatitis, although two infants had persistent mild elevations (less than two times normal) of alanine aminotransferase. The viral load in mothers, who transmitted HGV to their infants, was significantly higher than in nontransmitting mothers. Infants born by elective cesarean delivery had a lower rate of infection (3 in 7) compared with infants born by emergency cesarean delivery (2 of 2) or born vaginally (21 of 25) . In this study, HGV infection in breastfed infants was four times more common than in formula-fed infants, but this difference was not statistically significant because only four infants were formula fed. The authors report no correlation between infection rate and duration of breastfeeding was seen. Testing of the infants was not done frequently and early enough routinely through the first year of life to determine the timing of infection in these infants. 309 Schr\u00f6ter et al 371 reported transmission of HGV to 3 of 15 infants born to HGV RNA positive mothers at 1 week of age. None of 15 breast milk samples were positive for GBV-C/HGV RNA, and all of the children who were initially negative for HGV RNA in serum remained negative at follow-up between 1 to 28 months of age. 371 The foregoing data suggest that transmission is more likely to be vertical, before, or at delivery rather than via breastfeeding. The pathogenicity and the possibility of chronic disease due to HGV infection remain uncertain at this time. Insufficient data are available to make a recommendation concerning breastfeeding by HGV-infected mothers.",

Virus excretion of HHV-7 occurs in saliva, and PCR testing of blood cells and saliva are frequently positive in individuals with past infection. 463 Congenital infection of HHV-6 was detected via DNA PCR testing in 57 of 5638 of cord blood samples (1%), but HHV-7 was not detected in any of 2129 cord blood specimens. 165 HHV-7 DNA was detected by PCR in 3 of 29 breast milk mononuclear cell samples from 24 women who were serum positive for HHV-7 antibody. 137 In the same study, small differences were seen in the HHV-7 seropositive rates between breastfed infants and bottle-fed infants at 12 months of age (21.7% versus 20%), at 18 months of age (60% versus 48.1%), and at 24 months of age (77.3% versus 58.3%, respectively,).

The seroprevalence in pregnant women in endemic areas of Japan is as high as 4% to 5% and in nonendemic areas as low as 0.1% to 1.0%. HTLV-1 is not a major disease in the United States. In studies from Europe the seroprevalence in pregnant women has been noted to be up to 0.6%. These pregnant women were primarily of African or Caribbean descent. 138 HTLV-I antigen has been identified in breast milk of HTLV-I positive mothers. 220 Another report shows that basal mammary epithelial cells can be infected with HTLV-I and can transfer infection to peripheral blood monocytes. 254 Human milk from HTLV-I positive mothers caused infection in marmosets. 221, 453 HTLV-I infection clearly occurs via breastfeeding and a number of reports document an increased rate of transmission of HTLV-I to breastfed infants compared with formula-fed infants.* Ando et al 12, 13 in two separate reports demonstrated a parallel decline in antibodies against HTLV-I in both formula-fed and breastfed infants to a nadir at approximately 1 year of age and a subsequent increase in antibodies from 1 to 2 years of age. The percentage of children seropositive at 1 year of age in the breastfed and formula-fed groups, respectively, was 3.0% and 0.6%, at 1.5 years of age it was 15.2% and 3.9%, and at 2 years of age it was 41.9% and 4.6%. A smaller group of children followed through 11 to 12 years of age demonstrated no newly infected children after 2 years of age and *References 9, 10, 12, 13, 178-180, 407. no loss of antibody in any child who was seropositive at 2 years of age. 12, 13 Transmission of HTLV-I infection via breastfeeding is also clearly associated with the duration of breastfeeding. 407, 409, 446, 447 It has been postulated that the persistence of passively acquired antibodies against HTLV-I offers some protection through 6 months of life (Table 13-4) .",

            "text": "Various interventions have been proposed to decrease HTLV-I transmission via breastfeeding. Complete avoidance of breastfeeding was shown to be an effective intervention by Hino et al 180, 181 in large population of Japanese in Nagasaki. Avoiding breastfeeding led to an 80% decrease in transmission. Breastfeeding for a shorter duration is another effective alternative. Ando et al 11 showed that freezing and thawing breast milk decreased the infectivity of HTLV-I. Sawada et al 363 demonstrated in a rabbit model that HTLV-I immunoglobulin protected against HTLV-I transmission via milk. It is reasonable to postulate that any measure that would decrease the maternal provirus load or increase the anti-HTLV-I antibodies available to infants might decrease the risk for transmission. The overall prevalence of HTLV-I infection during childhood is unknown because the majority of individuals do not manifest illness until much later in life. The timing of HTLV-I infection in a breastfeeding population has been difficult to assess because of passively acquired antibodies from the mother and issues related to testing. Furnia et al 139 In areas where the prevalence of HTLV-I infection (in the United States, Canada, or Europe) is rare, the likelihood that a single test for antibody against HTLV-I would be a false positive test is high compared with the number of true positive tests. Repeat testing is warranted in many situations. 66 Quantification of the antibody titer and the proviral load is appropriate in a situation when mother-to-child transmission is a concern. A greater risk for progression to disease in later life has not been shown for HTLV-I infection through breast milk, but early-life infections are associated with the greatest risk for adult T-cell leukemia. 402 The mother and family should be informed about all these issues. If the risk for lack of breast milk is not too great and formula is readily available and culturally acceptable, then the proscription of breastfeeding, or at least a recommendation to limit the duration of breastfeeding to 6 months or less, is appropriate to limit the risk for HTLV-I transmission to the infant. Freezing and thawing breast milk before giving it to an infant might be another reasonable intervention to decrease the risk for transmission, although no controlled trials document the efficacy of such an intervention. Neither Ig nor antiviral agents against HTLV-I are available at this time.",

The estimated rate of transmission was 20%. The time to seroconversion (after the initial loss of passively acquired maternal antibodies) for infected infants seemed to range between 1 and 3 years of age. 304 At this time avoidance of breastfeeding and limiting the duration of breastfeeding are the only two possible interventions with evidence of effectiveness for preventing HTLV-II mother-to-child transmission. 207 With the current understanding of retroviruses, it is appropriate in cases of documented HTLV-II maternal infection to recommend avoiding or limiting the duration of breastfeeding and provide alternative nutrition when financially practical and culturally acceptable. Mothers should have confirmatory testing for HTLV-II and measurement of the proviral load. Infants should be serially tested for antibodies to HTLV-II and have confirmatory testing if seropositive after 12 to 18 months of age.

            "text": "The question of the contribution of breastfeeding in mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission is not a trivial one when one considers the following: 3. The WHO estimates that 2.7 million people were newly infected with HIV-1 in 2007, with children younger than 14 years old making up 370,000 of that 2.7 million. (This number has declined due to increasing access to interventions to prevent mother-to-infant transmission. Availability of antiretroviral therapy for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission in developing countries in 2007 was estimated to reach 33% of the mothers who needed it.) 419 4. Breastfeeding contributes an estimated 10% to 20% increase in the overall mother-to-child transmission rates, over and above intrauterine and intrapartum transmission, when no specific interventions to prevent transmission via breastfeeding are utilized. 5. Despite a dramatic increase in the number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy in developing countries (3 million), this represented only 31% of the individuals who needed treatment. 419 The evidence of HIV transmission via breastfeeding is irrefutable. Multiple publications summarize the current evidence for HIV transmission via breastfeeding in the literature. 232, 341, 420 Since 1985, case reports have documented HIV transmission via breast milk to children around the world. 182, 198, 249, 465 Primary HIV infection in breastfeeding mothers, with the concomitant high viral load, is associated with a particularly high rate of HIV transmission via breast milk. Palasanthiran et al 322 estimated that risk at 27%.Large observational studies have demonstrated higher rates of HIV transmission in breastfed infants of mothers with chronic HIV infection compared with formula-fed infants. 43, 108, 124 A systematic analysis of published reports estimated the additional risk for perinatal HIV transmission due to breastfeeding to be 14% (95% confidence interval 7% to 22%). 117 More recently published cohort studies similarly attributed additional risk for HIV transmission due to breastfeeding at 4% to 22% over and above the risk from prenatal and intrapartum transmission. 38, 104, 121 Laboratory reports demonstrate the presence of cell-free virus and cell-associated virus in breast milk as well as various immunologic factors that could block or limit infection.* A dose-response relationship has been observed, correlating the HIV viral load in human milk as well as a mother' s plasma viral load with an increased transmission risk for the breastfed infant. 335, 345, 351, 373 Many of the potential risk factors associated with human milk transmission of HIV is higher the longer the duration of breastfeeding. 108, 251, 282, 290, 424 Maternal characteristics related to transmission of HIV via human milk include younger maternal age, higher parity, lower CD4+ counts, higher plasma viral loads, and breast abnormalities (mastitis, abscess, or nipple lesions). Characteristics of human milk that relate to a higher risk for transmission include higher viral load in the milk, lower concentrations of antiviral substances (lactoferrin, lysozyme), and lower concentrations of virus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, levels of various interleukins (IL-7, IL-15), 434, 435 secretory IgA, and IgM. Mixed breastfeeding is also associated with a higher risk for HIV transmission compared with exclusive breastfeeding. 99, 100, 410 The measurable benefits of breast milk versus the relative risk for HIV transmission to the infant due to exclusive breastfeeding (with optimization of other factors to decrease HIV transmission) have been reported in a couple of studies. 97, 229 The measurable benefits of receiving breast milk versus the relative increased risk for HIV transmission will need to be determined in a prospective fashion in different locales. 247",

The complete avoidance of breastfeeding in certain situations may lead to increased risk for illness and death due to other reasons besides HIV transmission. 106 A study from Kenya showed improved HIV-1-free survival rates in a formula-fed group of children born to HIV-positive mothers, but the breastfed and formula groups had similar mortality rates (24.4% versus 20.0%, respectively) and similar incidences of diarrhea and pneumonia in the first 2 years of life. 272 No difference in the two groups was seen in the prevalence of malnutrition, but the breastfed infants had better nutritional status in the first 6 months of life. Arpadi et al 20 recommend additional nutritional interventions to complement breastfeeding in this population after 6 months of age. Two reports from Zambia document the benefit of exclusive breastfeeding for decreasing late HIV transmission and the lower mortality at 12 months in infants who had continued breastfeeding rather than had discontinued breastfeeding at 4 months of age. 229, 385 In Malawi, HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants who were breastfed (exclusive breastfeeding for 2 months and mixed feeding after that) had lower mortality at 24 months than those who were not breastfed. 405 A report from Botswana examined breastfeeding plus infant zidovudine prophylaxis for 6 months versus formula feeding plus infant zidovudine for 1 month; this study showed a decreased risk for vertical transmission with formula feeding, but also increased cumulative mortality for the HIV-infected infants at 7 months of age who were in the formula-fed group. 411 A study from South Africa examining the use of vitamin A also demonstrated less morbidity in HIV-infected children who were breastfed than not breastfed. 102 Other abstract reports have shown increased morbidity in HIV-infected children due to diarrhea, gastroenteritis, and hospitalization after weaning from breastfeeding. 205, 226, 315, 413 ",

In the Mashi Study in Botswana, Thior et al 411 evaluated infants randomized to breastfeeding plus infant zidovudine for 6 months or formula feeding plus 1 month of infant zidovudine. The cumulative infant mortality was significantly higher at 7 months for the formula-fed group but at 18 months it was similar between the two groups. The breastfed infants were more likely to become HIV infected despite the 6 months of zidovudine prophylaxis. 411 Becquet et al 33 analyzed data from Cote d'Ivoire for 2001 to 2005; 47% of the HIVexposed infants were breastfed for a median of 4 months, and 53% were formula fed and observed for 2 years. No significant difference in the rate of HIV infection was seen in the two groups, and no significant difference between the two groups was seen for morbid events (diarrhea, acute respiratory infections or malnutrition) or hospitalization or death. The authors attributed these good outcomes to effective nutritional counseling and care, access to clean water, and the provision of a safe and continuous supply of breast milk substitute. 33 Coovadia et al 97 studied exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life as an intervention in South Africa. Of the exclusively breastfed infants, 14.1% at 6 weeks of age and 19.5% at 6 months of age were HIV infected. Breastfed infants who also were fed solids or formula milk were more likely to acquire infection than exclusively breastfed infants. The cumulative mortality at 3 months of age was markedly lower for exclusively breastfed infants (6.1%) versus 15.1% in the infants receiving mixed feedings.",

Infants were randomly assigned to two different counseling programs that advised either abrupt weaning at 4 months or prolonged breastfeeding. In the weaning intervention group, 69% of mothers stopped breastfeeding by 5 months compared with a median duration of breastfeeding of 16 months in the control group. The study found no significant difference in HIV-free survival at \u2022 Women and their health care providers need to be aware of the potential risk for transmission of HIV infection to infants during pregnancy and in the peripartum period and through breast milk. \u2022 Documented, routine HIV education and routine testing with the consent of women seeking prenatal care are strongly recommended so that each woman knows her HIV status and the methods available both to prevent the acquisition and transmission of HIV and to determine whether breastfeeding is appropriate. \u2022 At delivery, education about HIV and testing with the consent of women whose HIV status during pregnancy is unknown are strongly recommended. Knowledge of a woman' s HIV status assists in counseling on breastfeeding and helps each woman understand the benefits to herself and her infant of knowing her serostatus and the behaviors that would decrease the likelihood of acquisition and transmission of HIV. \u2022 Women who are known to have HIV infections must be counseled not to breastfeed or provide their milk for the nutrition of their own or other' s infants. \u2022 In general, women who are known to be HIV seronegative should be encouraged to breastfeed. However, women who are HIV seronegative but at particularly high risk for seroconversion (e.g., injection drug users and sexual partners of known HIV-positive persons or active drug users) should be educated about HIV with an individualized recommendation concerning the appropriateness of breastfeeding. In addition, during the perinatal period, information should be provided on the potential risk for transmitting HIV through breast milk and about methods to reduce the risk for acquiring HIV infection. \u2022 Each woman whose HIV status is unknown should be informed of the potential for HIV-infected women to transmit HIV during the peripartum period and through breast milk and the potential benefits to her and her infant of knowing her HIV status and how HIV is acquired and transmitted. The health care provider needs to make an individualized recommendation to assist the woman in deciding whether to breastfeed. 24 months in the two groups (83.9% versus 80.7%). Children already infected by 4 months of age had a higher mortality if they were assigned to the early weaning group (73.6% versus 54.8%). Additional analysis showed that in mothers with less severe HIV disease early weaning was clearly harmful to the infant. 231 Arpadi et al 20 studied the growth of HIV-exposed, uninfected children who were exclusively breastfed for 4 months with rapid weaning to replacement foods or exclusively breastfed until 6 months and then continued breastfeeding with complementary foods. Weight-for-age z scores dropped markedly in both groups from 4 to 15 months of age but less so in the continued breastfeeding group. Length-for-age z score also dropped dramatically, but was not influenced by continued breastfeeding. Even in this HIV-exposed, uninfected group of children, additional nutritional interventions are essential to complement breastfeeding beyond 6 months of age. 20",

            "text": "A laboratory report shows that mothers receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) while breastfeeding do have decreased whole breast milk HIV-1 viral loads (23/26 mothers had less than 50 copies/mL) compared with mothers who did not receive HAART (9/25 with less than 50 copies/mL). However, the whole milk HIV-1 DNA load (measured as \"undetectable\" at less than 10 copies/10 6 cells) was not significantly different in the HAART (13 of 26 mothers)] and non-HAART (15 of 23) groups. 378 HIV-1 DNA is incorporated into cells found in breast milk. Another group showed significantly lower HIV RNA levels in the breast milk of women treated with nevirapine, zidovudine, and lamivudine compared with women not receiving antiretroviral therapy. 152 The use of maternal HAART seems to decrease HIV-1 transmission via breastfeeding. One group working in Mozambique, Malawi, and Tanzania working with mother-infants pairs receiving HAART as prevention during pregnancy compared one cohort (809 mother-infant pairs) who received supplementary formula and water filters for the first 6 months of life with a second cohort (251 motherinfant pairs) breastfeeding exclusively and the mothers receiving HAART for the first 6 months. The cumulative incidence rate of HIV infection at 6 months of age was 2.7% for the formula-fed infants and 2.2% for breastfed infants. Through 6 months of age no apparent additional risk for late postnatal transmission of HIV was observed. 323 The Petra study team working in Tanzania, South Africa, and Uganda examined the efficacy of three shortcourse regimens of zidovudine and lamivudine in preventing early and late HIV transmission in this predominantly breastfeeding population. 332 There were four regimens: A, zidovudine and lamivudine starting at 36 weeks' gestation plus intrapartum medication and 7-days' postpartum treatment; B, same as A without the prepartum component; C, intrapartum zidovudine and lamivudine only; D, placebo. At week 6 the HIV transmission rates were 5.7% in group A, 8.9% in group B, 14.2% in group C, and 15.3% in group D. At 18 months the HIV infection rates were 15% in group A, 18% in group B, 20% in group C, and 22% in group D. Although a measurable decrease in transmission at 6 weeks of age was observed, limited protection was seen at 18 months of age. An observational study from Tanzania compared maternal HAART for 6 months with exclusive breastfeeding and abrupt weaning at 5 to 6 months of age with a historical control of the same feeding schedule without the postnatal maternal HAART. In the treatment group the cumulative HIV transmission was 4.1% at 6 weeks, 5.0% at 6 months, and 6.0% at 18 months of age. The cumulative HIV infection or death rate was 8.6% at 6 months and 13.6% at 18 months of age. The cumulative risk for HIV transmission was 1.1% between 6 and 18 months. The HIV transmission in this treatment group was half the transmission rate in the historical control group. 218 Another study in sub-Saharan Africa with 6 months of maternal HAART and exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months demonstrated 94% HIV-free survival at 12 months of age; the maternal and infant mortality rates for the treated mother-infant pairs were significantly lower than the country' s maternal and infant mortality rates. 264 Antiretroviral therapy prophylaxis for infants is another investigated intervention to decrease HIV transmission via breastfeeding. In a study from Cote d'Ivoire comparing different groups over time, infants received zidovudine (ZDV) alone as ZDV prophylaxis, a single dose of nevirapine (NVP), and 7 days of zidovudine (ZDV) as NVP/ ZDV prophylaxis, or a single dose of nevirapine plus zidovudine and lamivudine (3TC) for 7 days as NVP/ZDV/3TC prophylaxis. Formula feeding (FF) was compared with exclusive shortened breastfeeding (ESB) upto 4 months of age and prolonged breastfeeding (PB). The cumulative transmission rates at 18 months were 22.3% in 238 infants in the ZDV + PB group, 15.9% in 169 infants in the NVP/ZDV + ESB group, 9.4%, in the 195 infants in the NVP/ZDV +FF group, 6.8% in the 198 infants in the NVP/ZDV/3TC + ESB group, and 5.6% in the 126 infants in the NVP/ZDV/3TC + FF group. 252 Kumwenda et al 235 working in Malawi demonstrated decreased HIV transmission with breastfeeding and two different infant prophylaxis regimens. At 9 months of age, they observed a 10.6% occurrence of HIV transmission for infants receiving a single dose of nevirapine plus 1 week of zidovudine compared with 5.2% in the group receiving a single dose of nevirapine plus 1 week of zidovudine plus 14 weeks of daily nevirapine, and 6.4% in the group receiving a single dose of nevirapine plus 1 week of zidovudine plus 14 weeks of nevirapine and zidovudine. 235 In the Mitra Study in Tanzania in which the median time of breastfeeding was 18 weeks, the HIV transmission rate at 6 months in the infants who received zidovudine plus 3TC for 1 week plus 3TC alone for breastfeeding through 6 months of age was less than 50% of the transmission rate for those infants receiving only 1 week of zidovudine plus 3TC. 217 A summary of three trials in Ethiopa, India, and Uganda compared a single dose of nevirapine at birth for infants with 6 weeks of daily nevirapine in predominantly breastfed infants whose mothers were counselled regarding feeding per the WHO/ UNICEF guidelines. At 6 months 87 of 986 infants in the single-dose group and 62 of 901 in the extended-dose group were HIV infected, which was not statistically significant. The authors suggested that a longer course of infant antiretroviral prophylaxis might be more effective. 388",

In the 2 years after delivery the HIV-positive women had higher hospital admission (approximately two times increased risk) and death rates (relative risk greater than 10) than HIV-negative women. 271 Chilongozi et al 90 reported on 2292 HIV-positive mothers from four sub-Saharan sites followed for 112 months. Serious adverse events occurred in 166 women (7.2%); 42 deaths occurred in the HIV-positive women, and no deaths occurred in 331 HIV-negative women. 90 Several studies have examined breastfeeding relative to mothers' health and reported conflicting results. The first study from Kenya demonstrated a significantly higher mortality rate in breastfeeding mothers compared with a formula-feeding group in the 2 years after delivery. The hypothesized explanation offered by the authors for this difference was increased metabolic demands, greater weight loss, and nutritional depletion. 294 A second study from South Africa showed an overall lower mortality rate in the two groups with no significant difference in mortality rate in the 10 months of observation. 101 Kuhn et al 227 reported no difference in mortality at 12 months after delivery between 653 women randomly assigned to a short breastfeeding group (326 women, median breastfeeding duration 4 months, 21% still breastfeeding at 12 months) and a long breastfeeding group (327 women, 90% breastfeeding at 5 months, 72% breastfeeding at 12 months, median 15 months). The HIV-related mortality rates were high (4.9%), but not associated with prolonged lactation. 227 Walson et al 433 followed 535 HIV-positive women for 1 to 2 years in Kenya. The mortality risk was 1.9% at 1 year and 4.8% at 2 years of follow-up. Although less than 10% of women reported a hospitalization during the 2 years, they experienced various common infections (pneumonia, diarrhea, TB, malaria, STDs, urinary tract infections, mastitis). Breastfeeding was a significant cofactor for diarrhea and mastitis but not for pneumonia, TB, or hospitalization. 433 In summary, breastfeeding of infants by HIV-positive mothers does lead to an increased risk for HIV infection in the infants. Much remains to be understood about the mechanisms of HIV transmission via breast milk and the action and efficacy of different interventions to prevent such transmission. The complete avoidance of breastfeeding is a crucial component for the prevention of perinatal HIV infection in the United States and many other countries.",

Human milk mucin has been demonstrated to inhibit rotavirus replication and prevent experimental gastroenteritis. 457 The mechanisms of rotavirus immunity are not well understood. They are thought to be multifactorial with cell-mediated immunity limiting severity and the course of infection, while humoral immunity protects against subsequent infections. Innate and adaptive responses at the level of the mucosa are probably the most important. 134 Exclusive breastfeeding may decrease the likelihood of severe rotavirus-related diarrhea by as much as 90%. 93, 377 Although breastfeeding does not prevent infection with rotavirus, it seems to decrease the severity of rotavirus-induced illness in children younger than 2 years old. 93, 123, 184 At least one study suggested that this may represent simply the postponement of severe rotavirus infection until an older age. 93 One study suggested that protection against rotavirus rapidly declines upon discontinuation of breastfeeding. 356 This delay in rotavirus infection until the child is older may be beneficial in that the older child may be able to tolerate the infection or illness with a lower likelihood of becoming dehydrated or malnourished. Continuing breastfeeding during an episode of rotavirus illness with or without vomiting is appropriate and often helpful to the infant. No reason to suspend breastfeeding by a mother infected with rotavirus is apparent.",

Additional types of rotavirus vaccines are undergoing study in various countries, specifically examining the efficacy of the vaccines in low and medium income countries. 444 Some of the explanations for the slow implementation of an effective vaccine globally include differences in protection with specific vaccines in high income countries compared with low or medium income countries, the unfortunate association with intussusception in the United States, the delayed recognition of the significant rotavirus-related morbidity and mortality, and the cost of the new vaccines. The question of variable efficacy of the specific rotavirus vaccines in developed and developing countries remains an important one. Several trials are examining this issue and attempting to address factors such as maternal transplacentally transferred antibodies, breastfeeding practices (especially immediately before immunization with a live oral rotavirus vaccine), stomach acid, micronutrient malnutrition, interfering gut flora, and differences in the epidemiology of rotavirus in different locations. 327 Evidence indicates that maternal immunization with rotavirus vaccine can increase both transplacental acquisition of antibodies and secretory IgA in breast milk. 334 Additionally, oral rotavirus vaccines have been able to stimulate a good serologic response in both formula-fed and breastfed infants, although the antigen titers may need to be modified to create an optimal response in all infants. 86 The actual protective effect of these vaccines in different situations and strategies will require measurement in ongoing prospective studies.",

Perinatal infection is not clinically significant. Postnatal infection occurs infrequently in children younger than 1 year of age because of passively acquired maternal antibodies. The predominant age of infection is 5 to 14 years old, and more than half of those with infections are asymptomatic. Postnatal rubella is a self-limited, mild viral infection associated with an evanescent rash, shotty adenopathy, and low-grade transient fever. It most often occurs in the late winter and spring. Infants with congenital infection shed the virus for prolonged periods from various sites and may serve as a source of infection throughout the year.

Children older than 1 year of age can be safely and reasonably vaccinated with smallpox in the face of a probable smallpox exposure. Smallpox vaccination of infants younger than 1 year of age is contraindicated. Breastfeeding is listed as a contraindication to vaccination in the preevent vaccination program. It is unknown whether vaccine virus or antibodies are present in breast milk. The risk for infection due to contact or aerosolization of virus from a mother' s smallpox vaccination site is the same for breastfed and formula-fed infants. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also does not recommend preevent smallpox vaccination of children younger than 18 years old. 443 A report documents tertiary contact vaccinia in a breastfeeding infant. 140 A United States military person received a primary smallpox vaccination and developed a local reaction at the inoculation site. Despite reportedly observing appropriate precautions, the individual' s wife developed vesicles on both areolae (secondary contact vaccinia). Subsequently, the breastfeeding infant developed lesions on her philtrum, cheek, and tongue. Both the mother and infant remained well and the infections resolved without therapy. Culture and PCR testing confirmed vaccinia in both the mother' s and the infant' s lesions. The breast milk was not tested. 140 In a review from 1931 to 1981, Sepkowitz 375 reported on 27 cases of secondary vaccinia in households. The CDC reported 30 suspected cases of secondary/tertiary vaccinia with 18 of those cases confirmed by culture or PCR. The 30 cases were related to 578,286 vaccinated military personnel. This is an incidence of 5.2 cases per 100,000 vac cinees and 7.4 cases per 100,000 primary vaccinees. 79 In a separate report on the civilian preevent smallpox vaccination program, 37,802 individuals were vaccinated between January and June 2003, and no cases of contact vaccinia were reported. 77 The risk for contact vaccinia is low. The risk is from close or intimate contact. In the above-mentioned case, the risk for the infant was contact with the mother' s breasts, the inadvertent site of her contact vaccinia. Breastfed and formulafed infants are equally at risk from close contact in the household of a smallpox vaccinee or a case of secondary vaccinia, and separation from the individual is appropriate in both situations. If the breast of the nursing mother is not involved, expressed breast milk can be given to the infant.",

No clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatitis was found in the 22 children who were observed to be TTV DNA positive during the period of the study. 371 Other authors have reported TTV in breast milk detected by PCR. They describe the absence of TTV DNA in infants at 5 days and 3 months of age, and 4 of 10 infants were positive for TTV DNA at 6 months of age, suggesting the late acquisition of infection via breastfeeding. 197 TT virus is transmitted in utero and is found in breast milk. No evidence of clinical hepatitis in infants related to TTV infection and no evidence for a late chronic hepatitis exist. Given the current available information, no reason to proscribe breastfeeding by TTV-positive mothers is compelling.",

Brinton et al, 52 McTiernan and Thomas, 276 and Layde et al 245 showed the clearly protective effects of breastfeeding. Another example is a study conducted to clarify whether lactation has a protective role against breast cancer in an Asian people, regardless of confounding effects of age at first pregnancy, parity, and closely related factors. 458 In a hospital-based case-control study of 521 women without breast cancer, statistical adjustment for potential confounders and a likelihood ratio test for linear trend were done by unconditional logistic regression. Total months of lactation regardless of parity was the discriminator. Regardless of age of first pregnancy and parity, lactation had an independent protective effect against breast cancer in Japanese women. 458 Although breast cancer incidence is influenced by genetics, stress, hormones, and pregnancy, breastfeeding clearly has a protective effect. \"There is a reduction in the risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women who have lactated. No reduction in the risk of breast cancer occurred among postmenopausal women with a history of lactation,\" according to Newcombe et al, 299 reporting a multicenter study in 1993.",

A syndrome of malformations has been carefully described with congenital varicella-zoster virus infection, typically involving limb deformity, skin scarring, and nerve damage, including to the eye and brain. 148 Perinatal infection can lead to severe infection in infants if maternal rash develops 5 days or less before delivery and within 2 days after delivery. Illness in infants usually develops before 10 days of age and is believed to be more severe because of the lack of adequate transfer of antibody from the mother during this period and transplacental spread of virus to the fetus and infant during viremia in the mother. Varicella in a mother occurring before 5 days before delivery allows sufficient formation and transplacental transfer of antibodies to the infant to ameliorate disease even if the infant is infected with varicella-zoster virus. Mothers who develop varicella rash more than 2 days after delivery are less likely to transfer virus to the infant transplacentally; they pose a risk to the infants from postnatal exposure, which can be diminished by the administration of varicellazoster Ig to the infant. Postnatal transmission is believed to occur through aerosolized virus from skin lesions or the respiratory tract entering the susceptible infant's respiratory tract. Airborne precautions are therefore appropriate in the hospital setting. Infants infected with varicella-zoster virus in utero or in the perinatal period (younger than 1 month of age) are more likely to develop zoster (reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus) during childhood or as young adults. Postnatal varicella from nonmaternal exposure can occur but is generally mild when it develops after 3 weeks of age or when a mother has passed on antibodies against varicella-zoster virus via the placenta. Severe postnatal varicella does occur in premature infants or infants of varicella-susceptible mothers. When a mother' s immune status relative to varicella-zoster virus is uncertain and measurement of antibodies to varicella-zoster virus in mother or infant cannot be performed promptly (less than 72 hours), administration of VZIG 81 or IVIG to the infant exposed to varicella or zoster in the postnatal period is indicated. Ideally a mother' s varicella status should be known before pregnancy, when varicella virus vaccine could be given if indicated.",

Varicella DNA was not detected in any of the 217 breast milk samples from the 12 women, all of whom seroconverted after vaccination. 45 One case of suspected transfer of varicella-zoster virus to an infant via breastfeeding has been reported, but virus may have been transmitted by respiratory droplet or exposure to rash before the mother began antiviral therapy. 459 Isolation of an infant from the mother with varicella and interruption of breastfeeding should occur only while the mother remains clinically infectious, regardless of the method of feeding. As soon as the infant has received varicella-zoster Ig, expressed breast milk can be given to an infant if no skin lesions involve the breasts. Persons with varicella rash are considered noninfectious when no new vesicles have appeared for 72 hours and all lesions have crusted, usually in 6 to 10 days. Immunocompetent mothers who develop zoster can continue to breastfeed if the lesions do not involve the breast and can be covered because antibodies against varicella-zoster virus are provided to the infant via the placenta and breast milk and will diminish the severity of disease, even if not preventing it. Conservative management in this scenario would include giving an infant varicella-zoster Ig as well (see Table 13 -5). 331 It is estimated that 150 to 300 asymptomatic cases of West Nile infection occur for every 20 febrile illnesses and for every one case of meningoencephalitis associated with West Nile virus. West Nile fever is usually a mild illness of 3 to 6 days' duration. The symptoms are relatively nonspecific, including malaise, nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, and rash. West Nile disease is characterized by severe neurologic symptoms (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis, and occasionally optic neuritis, cranial nerve abnormalities, and seizures). Children are infrequently sick with West Nile virus infection and infants younger than 1 year of age have rarely been reported. 331 The case-fatality rate for 2003 in the United States was approximately 2.5%, but has been reported as high as 4% to 18% in hospitalized patients. The case-fatality rate for persons older than 70 years of age is considered to be higher, 15% to 29% among hospitalized patients in outbreaks in Romania and Israel. 331 The primary mechanism of transmission is via a mosquito bite. Mosquitoes from the genus Culex are primary vectors. The bird-mosquito-bird cycle serves to maintain and amplify the virus in the environment. Humans and horses are incidental hosts. The pathogenesis of the infection is believed to occur via replication of the virus in the skin and lymph nodes, leading to a primary viremia that seeds secondary sites before a second viremia causes the infection of the CNS and other affected organs. 59, 111 Transmission has been reported in rare instances during pregnancy 7,73 via organ transplant 199 and percutaneously in laboratory workers. 75 A study of West Nile virus infection in pregnancy documented four miscarriages, two elective abortions, and 72 live births. Cord blood samples were tested in 55 infants and 54 of 55 were negative for anti-West Nile virus IgM. Three infants had West Nile virus infection, which could have been acquired congenitally. Three of 7 infants who had congenital malformations might have been caused by maternal West Nile virus infection based on timing in pregnancy, but no evidence of West Nile virus etiology is conclusive. 312 West Nile virus transmission occurs via blood and blood product transfusion, 186 and the incidence has been estimated to be as high as 21 per 10,000 donations during epidemics in specific cities. 40 No evidence of direct person-to-person transmission without the mosquito vector has been found.",

One infant developed a rash and was otherwise well after maternal West Nile virus illness, but was not tested for West Nile virus infection. Two infants were identified who developed West Nile virus illness while breastfeeding, but no preceding West Nile virus infection was demonstrated in their mothers. Two other breastfeeding infants developed West Nile virus-specific antibodies after their mothers acquired West Nile virus illness in the last week of pregnancy, but congenital infection could not be ruled out. Live virus was not cultured from 45 samples of breast milk from mothers infected with West Nile virus during pregnancy, but West Nile virus RNA was detected in two samples and 14 samples had IgM antibodies to West Nile virus. 177 The above data suggest that West Nile virus infection through breastfeeding is rare. To date evidence of significant disease due to West Nile virus infection in young breastfeeding children is lacking. At this time, no reason exists to proscribe breastfeeding in the case of maternal West Nile virus infection if a mother is well enough to breastfeed. As with many other maternal viral illnesses, by the time the diagnosis is made in a mother, the infant may have already been exposed during maternal viremia and possible virolactia. The infant can and should continue to receive breast milk for the potential specific and nonspecific antiviral immunologic benefits.",

Illness due to yellow fever virus usually begins after an incubation period of 3 to 6 days, with acute onset of headache, fever, chills, and myalgia. Photophobia, back pain, anorexia, vomiting, and restlessness are other common symptoms. The individual is usually viremic for the first 4 days of illness until the fever and other symptoms diminish. Liver dysfunction and even failure can develop as can myocardial dysfunction. CNS infection is uncommon but symptoms can include seizures and coma.

            "text": "One case of congenital infection after immunization of a pregnant woman with the attenuated vaccine strain has been reported. One of 41 infants whose mothers had inadvertently received the yellow fever virus vaccine during pregnancy developed IgM and elevated neutralizing antibodies against the yellow fever virus without any evidence of illness or abnormalities. 418 A more recent study 404 from Brazil examined inadvertent yellow fever virus immunization during pregnancy during a mass vaccination campaign in 2000; 480 pregnant women received the yellow fever virus at a mean of 5.7 weeks' gestation, the majority of whom did not know their pregnancy status at the time. Seroconversion occurred in 98.2% of the women after at least 6 weeks after vaccination. Mild postvaccination illness (headache, fever, or myalgia) was reported by 19.6% of the 480 women. The frequency of malformations, miscarriages, stillbirths, and premature deliveries was similar to that found in the general population. At the 12-month follow-up point, 7% of the infants still demonstrated neutralizing antibodies against yellow fever virus, but after 12 months only one child was still seropositive. 404 Transmission of the yellow fever vaccine virus through breastfeeding was recently reported from Brazil. 85 The mother was immunized during a yellow fever epidemic in a nonendemic area in Brazil; 15 days after delivering a healthy female infant (39 weeks' gestational age) the mother received the 17DD yellow fever vaccine, and 5 days later the mother reported headache, malaise, and low-grade fever that persisted for 2 days. The mother continued breastfeeding and did not seek medical care for herself. At 23 days of age the infant became irritable, developed fever, and refused to nurse. The infant developed seizures and subsequent evaluation of the infant demonstrated an abnormal CSF and CT of the brain showed bilateral areas of diffuse low density suggestive of inflammation and consistent with encephalitis. Yellow fever-specific IgM antibodies were identified in the infant' s serum and CSF. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of the CSF also demonstrated yellow fever virus RNA identical to the 17DD yellow fever vaccine virus. Breast milk and maternal serum were not tested for yellow fever virus. 85 Yellow fever virus, wild or vaccine type, has not been identified in human breast milk, although another flavivirus, West Nile virus, has been detected in milk from a few lactating women with West Nile virus infection. 177 (See the section on West Nile virus.) Yellow fever vaccine-associated neurologic disease occurs at different rates in different age-groups, including 0.5 to 4.0 cases per 1000 infants younger than 6 months of age. 285 The 17D-derived yellow fever vaccines are contraindicated in infants younger than 6 months of age. Since 2002, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended, based on theoretical risk, that yellow fever vaccine be avoided in nursing mothers, except when exposure in highrisk yellow fever endemic areas is likely to occur. 76 No case of transmission of yellow fever virus from an infected mother to her infant via breastfeeding or breast milk has been reported. Published information on the severity of yellow fever virus infection in infants younger than 1 year of age, potential protection from passively acquired antibodies, or protection from breast milk is limited. No information on a differential risk in breastfed versus formula-fed infants is available. Given the well documented method of transmission of yellow fever virus via mosquitos, and the lack of evidence of transmission via breast milk, it makes more sense to protect all infants against mosquito bites than to proscribe breastfeeding, even in the mother infected with yellow fever virus. Continued breastfeeding or use of expressed breast milk will depend on a mother's health status and ability to maintain the milk supply while acutely ill. If another source of feeding is readily available then temporarily discarding expressed breast milk for at least 4 days of acute illness in the mother is a reasonable precaution.",

The adverse outcomes included miscarriage and stillbirth (11% of cases), perinatal death (3%), congenital anomalies (15%), and both early-and late-onset progressive infection in the infants. Silver 384 reviewed 11 published reports and concluded that Lyme disease during pregnancy is uncommon, even in endemic areas. Although the spirochete can be transmitted transplacentally, a significant immune response in the fetus is often lacking, and the association of Lyme infection with congenital abnormalities is weak. 401, 448 Little published information exists on whether B. burgdorferi can be transmitted via breast milk. One report showed the detection of B. burgdorferi DNA by PCR in the breast milk of two lactating women with untreated erythema migrans, but no evidence of Lyme disease or transmission of the spirochete in the one infant followed for 1 year. 369 No attempt to culture the spirochete was made, so it is not possible to determine if the detectable DNA was from viable spirochetes or noninfectious fragments. In that same study of 56 women with untreated erythema migrans who had detectable B. burgdorferi DNA in the urine, 32 still had detectable DNA in the urine 15 to 30 days after starting treatment, but none had it 6 months after initiating therapy. Ziska et al 466 reported on the management of nine cases of Lyme disease in women associated with pregnancy; seven of the nine women were symptomatic at conception and six received antibiotics throughout pregnancy. Follow-up of the infants showed no transmission of Lyme disease, even in the seven infants who had been breastfed. 466 The lack of adequate information on transmission of B. burgdorferi via breast milk cannot be taken as proof that it is not occurring. If one extrapolates from data on syphilis and the Treponema pallidum spirochete, it would be prudent to discuss the lack of information on the transmission of B. burgdorferi via breast milk with the mother or parents and to consider withholding breast milk at least until therapy for Lyme disease has begun or been completed. If the infection occurred during pregnancy and treatment has already been completed, an infant can breastfeed. If infection occurs postpartum or the diagnosis is made postpartum, infant exposure may have already occurred. Again, discussion with the mother or parents about withholding versus continuing breastfeeding is appropriate.",

Anemia, eosinophilia and even leukemoid reactions occur as part of the clinical pictures in young children. They also note at least 20 cases of hookworm diseases in newborn infants younger than 1 month of age. In the discussion of infantile hookworm infection, they note four routes of infection: direct contact with contaminated soil, \"sand-stuffed\" diapers, contaminated \"washed/wet\" diapers, and vertical equal to transmammary transmission or transplacental transmission. They postulated that infection of infants before 40 to 50 days of age would most likely be due to transplacental transmission and infection before environmental contact would most likely be due to transmammary transmission. Ample evidence is available in veterinary medicine of transmammary spread of helminths. 302, 382 At least two reports suggest the possibility of transmammary transmission of hookworms in humans.

Although most infants with congenital infection are asymptomatic at birth, visual abnormalities, learning disabilities, and mental retardation can occur months or years later. The syndrome of congenital toxoplasmosis is clearly defined, with the most severe manifestations involving the CNS, including hydrocephalus, cerebral calcifications, microcephaly, chorioretinitis, seizures, or simply isolated ocular involvement. The risk for fetal infection is related to the timing of primary maternal infection, although transmission can occur with preexisting maternal toxoplasmosis. 241 In the last months of pregnancy the protozoan is more readily transmitted to the fetus, but the infection is more likely to be subclinical. Early in pregnancy the transmission to a fetus occurs less frequently but does result in severe disease. Treatment of documented congenital infection is currently recommended, although duration and optimal regimen have not been determined, and reversal of preexisting sequelae generally does not occur. 343 Prevention of infection in susceptible pregnant women is possible by avoiding exposure to cat feces or the organism in the soil. Pregnant or lactating women should not change cat litter boxes, but if they must, it should be done daily and while wearing gloves. The oocyst is not infective for the first 24 to 48 hours after passage. Mothers can avoid ingestion of the organism by fully cooking meats and carefully washing fruits, vegetables, and food preparation surfaces. 94 In various animal models, T. gondii has been transmitted through the milk to the suckling young. The organism has been isolated from colostrum as well. The newborn animals became asymptomatically infected when nursed by an infected mother whose colostrum contained T. gondii. Only one report has identified T. gondii in human milk, and some question surrounds the reliability of that report. 241 Transmission during breastfeeding in humans has not been demonstrated. Breast milk may contain appropriate antibodies against T. gondii. Given the benign nature of postnatal infection, the absence of documented transmission in human breast milk, and the potential antibodies in breast milk, no reason exists to proscribe breastfeeding by a mother known to be infected with toxoplasmosis.",
