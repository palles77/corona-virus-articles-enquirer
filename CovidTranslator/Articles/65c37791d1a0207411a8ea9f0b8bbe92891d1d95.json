Increased CSF/serum ratios for Ig in the context of an intact BBB were never seen in the absence of intrathecal synthesis of virus-specific antibodies. Affinity-mediated immunoblot analysis revealed a broad pattern of virus-specific antibodies with embedded clusters of restricted heterogeneity, but no signs of oligoclonal Ig production carrying non-viral specificity. From these data it was concluded that BN rats do control the intracerebral spread of JHM virus effectively by a strong local virus-specific antibody response, thereby preventing a clinically apparent disease.",

In one of the most susceptible rat strains, the Lewis rat, SDE is clinically characterized by ataxic gait and hind leg paralysis. Many animals survive this disease but may later develop a relapse of this disorder (Wege et al. 1984a) . Histologically perivascular cuffings with well-defined demyelinated plaques are seen predominantly located in the brain-stem and spinal cord with viral antigen present in glia cells in the neighbourhood of plaques. The inflammatory reactions consist of macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells which are found in and around demyelinated areas as well as perivascular cuffings (Nagashima et al. 1978 (Nagashima et al. , 1979 Sorensen et al. 1980; Wege et al. 1983; Koga et al. 1984) . The lesions of perivascular cuffings can be transferred to syngeneic animals by adoptive lymphocyte transfers pointing to a pathogenetic role of a cell-mediated immune response in this disease whereas the intrathecal viral humoral immune response is weak as almost not noticeable in diseased Lewis rats (D~rries et al. 1986) .",

Clinically noticeable diseases are rare despite the occurrence of active demyelination and persistence of JHM virus in brain tissue over weeks ). In BN rats demyelination appears as a nodular lesion predominantly located in the periventricular white matter. Perivascular cell infiltrations are infrequent and always directly connected with destructive changes. However, both perivascular cuffings and cellular infiltrations in the nodular lesions in BN rats contain a great number of plasma cells unseen in Lewis rat lesions. Adoptive transfer experiments of lymphocytes from infected BN rats do not lead to any inducible CNS changes in recipient rats.",

Because of the subclinical infection of BN rats and the presence of high numbers of plasma cells in brain lesions of such animals, it was assumed that a pronounced viral humoral immune response may prevent spreading of the virus within the CNS resulting in a persistent infection without severe clinical disease. On the other hand, in Lewis rats a low humoral and a strong T cell response to basic myelin protein (MBP) may be important factors in the generation of the severe disease. Therefore, the present study describes an analysis of the humoral antiviral antibody response in the CNS of JHM-infected BN rats, in an attempt to understand more about the role of JHM virus-specific antibodies in virus infections leading to subacute demyelination.",

Filter-bound Ig was identified with the IgG fraction of rabbit anti-rat Ig serum labeled with peroxidase (1:100, 1 ml/10 cm 2 of filter area, Dako Patts, Hamburg, F.R.G.). To allow only high affinity reactions to take place in this detection procedure, stringency was kept high by dilution of all components of the detection system in 1% Tween 20, 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.4 M sodium chloride in 150 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.5.

Histologically, MDE consisted of nodular demyelinating lesions with prominent infiltration of plasma cells whereas small lymphocytes were only occasionally detectable. The demyelination was restricted to distinct perivascular areas of the brain revealing always signs of remyelination. No extension of the demyelinated area into the spinal cord could be noticed. Those rats with scars of Virus-specific antibodies in serum and CSF Sera and CSF samples were titred for JHM antibodies by a microenzyme immunoassay and the results are shown in Table 2 . All animals revealed virus-specific antibody titres in the serum between 1:100 and 1:12 800. It is most remarkable that two animals showing a titre of 1 : 3200 (rat No. 1 and rat No. 2) were analysed 9 months after inoculation with the virus. However, not all animals showing JHM antibodies in the serum were positive for JHM Ig in the corresponding CSF sample. Only eight animals gave a positive reading (titre > 1 : 10) on EIA.

The normal reference range was established by analysing healthy animals hyperimmunized with JHM virus or a strong immunogen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) intraperitoneally. The mean value for SAB was found to be 0.96 for KLH and 0.41 for JHM virus. SAB indices higher than those reference values would indicate intrathecal synthesis of antibodies specific for the antigen in question. As can be seen in Table 3 , all animals positive for JHM-specific antibodies in the CSF revealed increased SAB ratios (mean value: 37.72).

It has been proposed that presence of intrathecal antibody production over long time periods reflects the persistence of virus infection, but our studies suggest that presence of viral antigens in brain tissue is not mandatory as exemplified in animals No. 1 or 10.

Interestingly, all of those five animals have been identified to synthesize JHM virus-specific antibodies intrathecally. However, intrathecal production of virusspecific antibodies did not necessarily result in an increased CSF/serum ratio for total immunoglobulin. Rats No. 1, 8 and 10 raised high titres of JHM virus-specific antibodies intrathecally without any noticeable changes in the CSF protein profile. This observation is not unique to our animal model, since patients suffering from mumps meningitis may reveal the same phenomenon (Link et al. 1981; Ukkonen et al. 1981) . Obviously the amount of virus-specific antibody synthesized within the CSF is not always sufficient to be noticed as increased CSF/serum ratio for total Ig. These data clearly stress that the absence of clinical disease and a normal state of the BBB in animal models of virus-induced demyehnating diseases do not exclude histopathological changes and strong agent-specific antibody synthesis within the CNS compartment.",

Lewis rats with SDE show an intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins with almost the same frequency as clinically inapparent BN rats, but in the majority of diseased Lewis rats no antiviral antibodies were found despite presence of viral antigens in brain tissue indicating an antibody production against unknown antigens. Since Lewis rats are susceptible to EAE (Kornblum 1968 ) and SDE Lewis rats develop a cell-mediated immune reaction against basic myelin protein after JHM virus infection ) one could assume that the unidentified intrathecal antibodies may be directed against autoantigens, a phenomenon which is not seen in JHM-infected BN rats. In addition, a correlation between a significant disturbance of the BBB permeability in SDE Lewis rats in relation to active demyelination can be found, but not in infected BN rats. It is conceivable that in the infected BN rats the very efficient intrathecal virus-specific antibody response restricts the intracerebral spread of the virus and overcomes the infectious process as seen in those BN rats without inflammatory lesions. Although it is presently not known how in coronavirus-induced SDE of Lewis rats the virus infection elicits a T cell-mediated autoimmune response, a strong antiviral immune reaction detectable in the infected organ could have some regulatory functions. Massa and coworkers (1986) recently showed that coronavirus particles are capable of inducing Ia antigens on astrocytes in culture, which might allow such cells to present .antigens for T helper lymphocytes. These reactions can be prevented by monoclonal antibodies directed to the peplomer protein E2 of JHM virus. Since hyper-presentation of Ia molecules is probably connected with autoimmune diseases (Janeway et al. 1984 ) viral antibodies in the extracellular space of brain cells may be beneficial not only in neutralizing infectious virus, but also by blocking a virus-induced Ia expression on astrocytes. On the basis of these observations, studies are in progress in coronavirus-infected Lewis and BN rats to evaluate the pathogenetic role of viral antibodies with respect to the different JHM virus structural proteins. Certainly, information obtained in this animal model will be of help in the study of human demyelinating disease processes associated with viral infections.",
