            "text": "Epitope-based DNA vaccines designed to induce T cell responses specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) are being developed as a means of addressing vaccine potency. In this study, we predicted 4 T cell epitopes from ESAT-6, Ag85A/B and CFP-10 antigens and constructed an ECANS (epitopes casted in a natural structure) DNA vaccine by inserting the epitope DNA segments separately into the gene backbone of M. tb-derived HSP65 (heat shock protein 65) carrier. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of pECANS DNA vaccine were assessed in BALB/c mice after intramuscular immunization with 4 doses of 50 g ECANS DNA and followed by mycobaterial challenge 4 weeks after the last immunization. Compared to plasmid encoding HSP65, pECANS DNA immunization elicited remarkably higher levels of IFN-\u2425 production by both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, which were coupled with higher frequencies of antigen-specific T cells and higher CTL activity. Significantly enhanced levels of Th1 cytokines (IFN-\u2425 and IL-12) and increased serum IgG2a/IgG1 ratio were also noted, indicating a predominant Th1 immune response achieved by pECANS DNA immunization. In the consequence, a better protection against Mycobacterium bovis BCG challenge was achieved which was evidenced by reduced bacterial loads in lungs and spleens and profound attenuation of lung inflammation and injury. Our results suggested that multi-T cell-epitope based ECANS gene vaccine induced T cell response to multiple T cell epitopes and led to enhanced protection against mycobacterial challenge. This strategy might be a useful platform to design multi-T cell epitope-based vaccine against M. tb infection.",

It accounts for 4 deaths every minute and 2 million deaths annually and severely threats the health of humankind [1] . At present, the only available TB vaccine is the attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG). Although effective in preventing Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) infection in newborns and toddlers, BCG provides poor protection in adult pulmonary tuberculosis with varying protective efficacy [2] . The pre-exposure to environmental mycobacteria may prevent or mask BCG-induced protective immunity [3] . In addition, the protective efficacy of BCG is weakened by its continuing attenuation and loss of immunodominant antigens such as RD-1 antigens (CFP-10 and ESAT-6 proteins) [4] . Therefore, alternative preventive TB vaccines are urgently needed.",

However, searching for suitable antigens to elicit potent T cell immune response has been thwarted by the complexity of the M. tb proteome. Vaccines based on T cell epitopes represent an ideal approach to generate effective cellular immunity in the prophylactic and therapeutic settings, because multiple epitopes can be incorporated into one vaccine to induce broadly immune responses, reacting with various immunogenic epitopes present or absent in BCG [5] . Epitopes that are highly conserved among bacterial types or dominant epitopes from numerous gene products could be preferentially selected. Furthermore, the immune response would be restricted to the specific epitopes and required type of protective immune response would be generated [6, 7] , overcoming any potential safety concerns associated with the other vaccine regimens.",

            "text": "Development of epitope-based vaccines has been hampered for its relatively low antigenicity. Thus, different vaccine formats and delivery methodologies have been utilized including DNA vaccine, viral vector or protein carrier to solve the problem. Muti-CTL epitope DNA vaccines have been reported to induce broad CTL responses against HIV, HBV, SARS-CoV and so on [8] [9] [10] . Introduction of heterologous epitopes into protein carriers by genetic engineering or synthetic coupling method [11] can enhance the Th1 immune responses, induce more potent humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and promote epitope spreading [12] . Mycobacterial heat shock protein (HSP) 65, a chaperon protein, has received immense attention as a suitable and safe protein carrier because of its considerable instinct T helper epitopes, ability to chaperone antigenic peptides and facilitate the cross-presentation in APC [13] . It has been demonstrated that BCG-derived HSP65 is capable of delivering antigenic peptides into the MHC class I presentation pathway of APCs, and thus stimulating antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell responses [14] . It is also used for delivering B cell epitopes in the absence of adjuvants [15] . Besides, DNA vaccine encoding HSP65 protects mice from a virulent strain of M. tb challenge and exhibits cure effects, indicating HSP65 itself as an immunodominant TB antigen. Therefore, HSP65 is selected as a carrier for incorporation of multiple epitopes from the immunodominant antigens of M. tb.",

However, the criterion for antigen selection remains vague due to the complexity of the host immune response and the vast repertoire of TB proteome (approximately 4000 proteins). Secreted TB antigens such as Ag85 have been proved to induce stronger immune responses than those of cytosolic proteins in humans [22] . The Ag85 complex constituting of Ag85A, Ag85B and Ag85C proteins is also very important because of its involvement in the synthesis of M. tb cell wall. DNA vaccines encoding Ag85A and Ag85B stimulate strong cell-mediated immune responses and confer significant protection against aerosol or intravenous challenge with live H37Rv, indicating their significance [23] [24] [25] . In addition, RD-1-encoded proteins such as ESAT-6 and CFP-10, which lack in all BCG strains and present in pathologic M. tb, have been identified as potent T cell antigens in both animals and humans and are strongly recognized in the first and memory phases of M. tb infection [26, 27] . Adding these deleted antigens back to TB vaccines has been respected as an important strategy to improve the effects of TB vaccines [28] . Therefore in this study, we tried to identify multiple previously uncharacterized T cell epitopes from ESAT-6, Ag85A, CFP-10 and Ag85B antigens and cast them into H37Rv-dervied HSP65 to integrate multiple T cell epitopes into an immunogenic carrier to achieve the best protective effect. We demonstrated that this multi-epitope DNA vaccine efficiently elicited potent T cell immunity in the systemic lymphoid organs and gave significant protections against mycobacterial challenge which was evidenced by the greatly reduced bacterial burden and lung pathology.",

Evidence from correlative studies indicates that the presence of functional T cells may be associated with improved clinical outcomes in human tuberculosis [29] . Th1 cytokines appear to be also necessary to control the growth of M. tb and for the establishment of protective immune responses in animals and in humans, as deficiency in IL-12 or IFN-\u2425 results in higher susceptibility to M. tb infection [30] . In the current study, significantly higher IFN-\u2425 + T cell responses, whether to the inactivated H37Rv or the mixed epitopes, were elicited by pECANS-immunization than pHSP65 vaccination. And CD4 + T cells contributed more to the IFN-\u2425 production than CD8 + T cells. Meanwhile, a robust CTL response was noticed, indicating the induction of integrated T cell immune responses by pECANS. Strikingly higher amounts of IL-12 and IFN-\u2425, and lower amounts of IL-4 and IL-10 were observed in pECANS-immunized mice, suggesting a predominant Th1 immune response. Altogether, CD4 + Th1 and CD8 + CTLs as well as Th1 cytokines accounted for the ideal protection effect seen in pECANS immunized mice.",
