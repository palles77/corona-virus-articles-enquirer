For this purpose, phosphorus maps (P-maps) have been obtained by applying the N-windows Eger~on model for background subtraction from data acquired by a non-dedicated TEM Jeol 1200EXII equipped with a post-column PEELS Gatan 666-9000 and a Gatan Image Filter (GIF-100). To prevent possible errors in the evaluation of elemental maps and thus incorrect nucleic acid localization, we have studied different regions of swine testis (ST) cells with similar local density containing either high concemration of nucleic acids (condensed chromatin and ribosomes) or a very low concentration (mitochondria). Special care was taken to optimize the sample preparation conditions to avoid as much as possible the traditional artifacts derived from this source. Selection of the best set of preedge images for background fitting was also considered in order to produce \"true P-maps\". A new software for interactive processing of images series has been applied to estimate this set. Multivariate Statistical Analysis was used as a filtering tool to separate the \"useful information\" present in the inelastic image series (characteristic signal) from the \"non-useful information\" (noise and aqquisition artifacts). The reconstitution of the original image series preserving mainly the useful information allowed the computation of P-maps with improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This methodology has been applied to study the RNA content of maturation intermediate coronavirus particles found inside infected cells.",

Direct observation of nucleic acids with higher efficiency in ultrathin sections of virus-infected cells is thus a challenging objective that could be reached using in situ spectroscopic methods by the analysis of the P distribution, based on the specific elemental concentration of phosphorus in nucleic acids (around 3 at.%).",

In these cases the main drawback is the long acquisition time required to produce a data set (from one to several hours). Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) possesses higher sensitivity and spatial resolution than X-ray microanalysis for light elements (Leapman and Hunt, 1991; Krivanek et al., ]992 ). It has been used to obtain P-maps of nucleic acid (n.a.)-containing structures since 1980 (Ottensmeyer and Andrew, 1980) . Recent implementation of commercially available incolumn and post-column electron energy loss spectrometers has increased the use of energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM), with special emphasis on chemical mapping.",

            "text": "One of the main problems when dealing with elemental map computation in EFTEM is the subtraction of a nonnegligible background that lies under the characteristic elemental signal. This is especially importan t in the case of elements being present at a very low concentration, where the absolute value of the characteristic signal is much smaller than the background. The choice of the best \u00b6Corresponding author. background subtraction method therefore becomes critical. Background subtraction problems in EFTEM can be summarized as shown in Fig. 1 . Case (a) represents background subtraction from a model that is correctly fitted to the preedge images. In contrast, cases (b) and (c) represent incorrect adjustments that will render incorrect maps. Case (b) gives rise to overestimation of the elemental map (this includes the characteristic signal and part of the background), and case (c) leads to underestimation of the elemental map. Among the different methods currently accepted for map extraction, one of the most widely used models the background by the power law, B = A \u00d7 E -R (Egerton, 1975) . This method involves the computation of two parameters (A and R) and is also known as the \"three-window\" method, as it requires the acquisition of three images, two below the characteristic energy loss edge of the element (pre-edge images) and one above this energy loss value (post-edge image). It has been subsequently extended to N preedge and M post-edge images (Jeanguillaume et al., 1978; Bonnet et al., 1988) . Other mathematical formulae have been also used to model the background (Ottensmeyer, 1986; Bonnet et al., 1988; Ottensmeyer and Frankland, 1988; Tenailleau and Martin, 1992) . Negative results obtained in the case of P detection in mitochondrial dense granules originated from rat cultivated chondrocytes (Trebbia and Mory, 1990) , however, suggested that in the case of P-maps in biological sections, the power law is not valid in the region of the pre-edge images in the L2,3 transition in P (100 to 135 eV), due to the tail of the very intense \"plasmon peak\". The plasmon influence is even more important if the sample possesses a high mass-thickness (high thickness and/or high density in stained samples). This situation is similar to that shown in Fig. l(c) , in which P-maps could be under-estimated.",

(2) The ratio between the post and the pre-edge images (also known as the jump method), used mainly in Material Science to avoid crystal diffraction effects (Krivanek et al., 1992; Hofer et al., 1995) . Both methods increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the maps, and they are presently used for this reason (Olins et al., 1996 , Beniac et al., 1997a . In spite of rendering a good SNR, scaled two-window methods may produce false positive signals in high density areas, irrespective of the presence of P (Leapman, 1986) . This is particularly relevant in preparations treated with heavy metal salts (osmium, uranium or lead). In this case, the computed maps can be considered a mixture of density and elemental P-map, not allowing separation of both signals (Bonnet et al., 1988; Bonnet, 1995) , a case similar to that shown in Fig. lb . Cellular components P-maps have been a good test for background subtraction methods, as phosphorus represents less than 0.5% in mass concentration in these biological samples. By means of the spectrum-image acquisition technique in an STEM, reliable P-maps with good SNR were built of DNA in the head of a bacteriophage (Shuman et al., 1986 , Colliex et al., 1994 using a three-window method for background subtraction. This technique requires, however, long acquisition time (around 22 minutes for 32x64 pixel images (Shuman et al., 1986) or 20 minutes for 64x64 pixel images (Colliex et al., 1994) . More recently, using a TEM equipped with an in-column spectrometer, it has been possible to obtain P-maps of nucleic acid-containing structures with a high SNR by applying the three-window method (Vazquez-Nin et al., 1996) . Electron spectroscopic imaging of sectioned viruses has provided high-contrast imaging and an improvement of the resolution of the viral particles, also allowing a better detectability of the immunolabeling markers (Ozel et al., 1990) . Also, P-maps were obtained using a two-window method to study the organization of encapsidated DNA in vaccinia virus (Harauz et al., 1995) . Interpretation problems arose in this case due to the fact that the samples were conventionally fixed and embedded.",

Using this set-up, we have studied P-map computation using very thin unstained sections of cryosubstituted and HM23 resin cryoembedded swine testis (ST) cells, infected with a coronavirus. After checking the background subtraction method to separate the P-signal from mass-thickness contribution, we have applied Multivariate Phosphorous Maps by EFTEM 299 Statistical Analysis and, in particular, Factorial Analysis of Correspondence (FAC) (Bonnet et al., 1988; Bonnet and Trebbia, 1992; Trebbia and Mory, 1990; Bonnet, 1995) to the series of pre-and post-L2.3 P-edge images. Such factorial filtering allows noise reduction and elimination of artifacts that might have been produced in image acquisition and thus enables presentation of clearer and more reliable images of the P-containing structures. Once the methods were tested using cellular components of known elemental composition, we studied the RNA distribution of intracellular coronavirus particles.",

Vitrified specimens were stored in liquid nitrogen until use. For freeze-substitution, samples were transferred to a Reichert Jung (Leica, Austria) AFS freeze-substitution unit, and maintained 24 h at -90\u00b0C in pure methanol for complete substitution of the water in the sample, according to established procedures (Grief et al., 1994; Quintana, 1994) .

Quintana et al. (Trebbia and Mory, 1990) , as well as in other types of image analysis (Bretaudiere and Frank, 1986) . In our case, FAC has proved to be a successful tool for filtering. Reconstitution of images has been performed preserving only useful information (characteristic signal and background) that can be present in one factorial axis (series 1 and 2, containing approximately 70% of the global variance) or in two axes, as in the case of virus-containing samples (38% of the global variance). The criteria used to select the number of axes for the reconstitution process were based on the study of the factorial images. Only axes corresponding to those factorial images possessing \"organized information\" (Bonnet and Trebbia, 1992) should be used for reconstitution.

In our studies, considerable care has been taken with specimen preparation, since in a previous work from our group the structural preservation provided by freeze-substitution has been decisive to characterize the two types of viral-related particles that assemble in coronavirusinfected cells (Risco et al., 1998) . In this extended structural work, it was demonstrated that two types of TGEV virions accumulate in infected cells: large viral particles (size of the viral core around 68-80 nm) exhibit an internal clear centre and dense periphery, while small virions (size of the viral core around 50-65 nm) are homogeneously dense inside. To define whether these differences in density are due to different arrangements of the viral RNA, a suitable method for mapping nucleic acids is needed. Encapsidation of the viral genome is one of the most difficult steps to characterize when studying the sequence of viral assembly at the structural level, since RNA is usually detected with methods of variable efficiency. Only a small percentage of sectioned viral particles react with the probes used in in situ hybridization (ISH) or with RNase-colloidal gold complexes (Risco et al., 1998) . An additional problem of ISH is that the simultaneous detection of protein cannot be achieved in most cases, since proteolysis is often necessary to unmask nucleic acid molecules, frequently complexed with viral proteins within the virion. P-maps obtained on sections provide direct information of the RNA distribution, in spite of the presence of proteins complexed with viral proteins within the virion. Our results show two different distributions of phosphorus (and, hence, of RNA) in the viral particles analysed: peripheral (larger virions) or central (smaller virions) arrangement. According to the data obtained in our previous structural study, the small virions are the final product of assembly (infectious mature virions), while the large viral particles most likely represent a precursor form that assembles at early steps in morphogenesis. P-maps indicate, then, that a major change in RNA organization inside the viral particle takes place during the structural maturation suffered by TGEV virions during morphogenesis.",

It is also clear that future improvements would demand an increment of the P detection sensitivity by enhancement of the SNR.
