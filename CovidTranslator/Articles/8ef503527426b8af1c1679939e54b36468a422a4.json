The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, based in New York, found that the disease killed 3.26% of its insured US industrial workers aged 25-45.

It matters very little if is true or false. \" Fellow adviser Walter Lippman, another architect of this strategy, sent President Woodrow Wilson a memo saying that most citizens were \"mentally children\" and advising that \"self-determination\" had to be subordinated to \"order\" and \"prosperity\". In 1917, the day after receiving Lippman's memo, Wilson issued an executive order to control all government communication strategy during the war that was premised on keeping up morale.",

Chicago's director of public health, for instance, decided not to \"interfere with the morale of the community\", explaining: \"It is our job to keep people from fear. Worry kills more than the disease. \" That last phrase became a mantra repeated in hundreds of newspapers.

Shipyard workers were told that their duties were as important as a soldier's; they were paid only if they worked; and, unlike elsewhere, physicians were available to them on site. Yet absentee rates in the shipyards -one of the few industries for which there are good data -still ranged from 45% to 58% (ref. 3) . Absenteeism crippled the railroad system, which transported nearly all freight, bringing it to the point of collapse. It shut down telephone exchanges, closing off communication, and further isolating and alienating people. Grocers refused to open. Coal sellers closed. In cities and rural communities, the Red Cross reported that people \"were starving to death not for lack of food but because the well were too panic stricken to bring food to the sick\".",

In this city, society, although reeling, functioned. Food was delivered, and the sick were cared for. Where people had accurate information and knew what they faced, they often performed heroically. Red Cross professionals, physicians and nurses routinely risked their lives. When Philadelphia's city police -who knew the facts even if the papers weren't printing them -were asked to supply four volunteers to \"remove bodies from beds \u2026 and load them in vehicles\", 118 officers responded 4 .",

That is how trust disintegrates and how rumours -passed in the streets in 1918, today passed over Internet blogs -take hold and grow. I don't much care for the term 'risk communication' . It implies that the truth is being managed. The truth should not be managed, it should be told. Only by knowing the truth can imaginary horrors be transformed into concrete realities. And only then can people start to deal with those realities, and do so without panic. ",
