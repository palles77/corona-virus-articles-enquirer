            "text": "Ferrets are an increasingly popular pet in the United States. They are active, gregarious pets that delight their owners with their playful antics. One of the issues that ferret owners and veterinarians have had to deal with is their shortened life span brought on by multiple disease processes. Although literature cites the life span of the ferret as 8 to 10 years of age, most exotic veterinarians routinely see ferrets as ''old'' at as early as 3 years of age. The majority of the information on senior ferrets has focused on neoplastic diseases, primarily adrenal tumors and insulinomas. This article discusses husbandry and nutritional issues of the aging ferret along with some of the more commonly seen geriatric diseases, including neoplasia, and the available diagnostics and treatment options.",

They belong to the family, Mustelidae, and are related to mink, martens, badgers, otters, and skunks. In the United Kingdom, ferrets were used for rodent control and hunting rabbits. These practices still occur in Europe but to a lesser degree. In the United States, ferrets have been used in research and as pets. Hunting with ferrets is illegal in the United States and ferrets are considered a companion animal. Most ferret owners are as committed to their ferrets as dog and cat owners are to their pets, and they seek the same veterinary care that others expect for their dogs and cats.",

They need time out of the cage for exercise and mental stimulation. Ferrets should be allowed to play in a ferret-proof area for several hours daily, and this time can be divided throughout the day. In their cage, ferrets should have a retreat for sleeping, in the form of a cloth tube, hammock, or tent. Ferrets can be trained to use a litter box-a corner box works well because they like to back up into corners to defecate. Litter boxes should be close and easily accessed, as ferrets have a short gastrointestinal transit time and may not make it to a litter box in another room or area of the house.",

            "text": "Ferrets are strict carnivores. They have a short gastrointestinal tract that empties in 3 to 4 hours. Due to diminished gastrointestinal flora and few brush border enzymes, they do not metabolize carbohydrates well. 1 They also have difficulty digesting fiber. They require diets high in good-quality animal protein and fat with minimal carbohydrates and fiber. Excess carbohydrates may lead to pancreatic disease, such as insulinoma. Treats that are acceptable include pieces of chicken, eggs, and other high-protein snacks. Ferrets develop their dietary preferences in the first few months of age, so it is important that they be started on an appropriate diet early. 1 Changing an adult or older ferret's diet can be challenging. A whole prey diet has been advocated by many authorities and is fed in some areas of the world. In the United States, a goodquality dry ferret or kitten diet is recommended to aid in prevention of dental disease. As ferrets age, a switch to a senior ferret diet should be considered. Several geriatric diets are available. Weight loss, emaciation, and muscle wasting can occur in older ferrets. Long-term anorexia can lead to hepatic lipidosis. More frequent feedings and assisted feedings may be necessary in sick or senior ferrets (Fig. 1 ).",

Many ferrets can be restrained for venipuncture without sedation or anesthesia. For jugular venipuncture, the technique used in cats, with head tilted back and forelegs pulled forward over the edge of a table, works well. The jugular vein in ferrets is slightly more lateral than in cats or dogs. For the cranial vena cava approach, a ferret is held on its back with its front legs pulled caudally and the head and neck extended. A 25-gauge needle is inserted into the thoracic cavity between the manubrium and first rib at a 45 angle, pointing the needle toward the opposite rear leg. The needle is inserted to its hub, then slowly withdrawn while gently applying suction until blood begins to fill the syringe. For difficult or fractious ferrets, the author routinely masks them down with isoflurane or sevoflurane briefly to obtain the sample. Isoflurane anesthesia can reduce the hematocrit level, red blood cell count, and hemoglobin concentrations so be sure to note that the sample is taken with the ferret under anesthesia in the evaluation of the blood sample. 4",

The cause of adrenal tumors in ferrets is unknown; many theories have been considered. Early neutering has been implicated as have husbandry and nutrition issues. In the United States, ferrets are neutered at a few weeks of age, are housed indoors, and are on formulated diets. European ferrets are neutered later, often housed outdoors, and are fed a whole prey diet. A recent article revealed that when ferrets are neutered at a later age in Europe they too develop adrenal disease, indicating that it does not appear to be the age of neutering but the act of neutering that results in disease. 16 In contrast to canine and human adrenal disease (Cushing disease), serum cortisol levels are not elevated. 17 In ferrets, one or more of the plasma hormones are elevated: estradiol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, or androstenedione. These elevations can occur with adrenal cortical hyperplasia, adenoma, or adenocarcinoma. 17 Bilateral progressive alopecia, often accompanied by pruritus, is the most commonly reported clinical sign. Hair loss occurs in both genders and typically progresses from the tail forward to the shoulders and neck. Female ferrets may have an enlarged vulva and male ferrets an enlarged prostate. 15 Male ferrets may present with stranguria secondary to prostatic hyperplasia or prostatic cysts. Severe prostatomegaly can lead to urinary obstruction and result in acute renal failure. 18 Affected male ferrets may also exhibit aggression.",

Occasionally, an anemia may be present, and in severe cases a pancytopenia similar to that seen as a result of estrogen toxicity may be seen. A packed cell volume of less than 15% is associated with a grave prognosis. The serum chemistry profile is usually within normal limits, although ALT may be elevated. Radiographs can be helpful in reaching a presumptive diagnosis if an adrenal tumor is large enough to be visible or if there is displacement of other organs. Ultrasound can be used to determine the size and extent of tumors in association with other structures, such as the liver or caudal vena cava. 17 The dexamethasone suppression test and adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test are not useful as cortisol levels are not elevated. 17 A definitive diagnosis of adrenal cortical tumors can be reached by measuring plasma hormone levels or histopathology. A hormone plasma steroid panel measuring estradiol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, or androstenedione is offered by the University of Tennessee. 19 Treatment includes medical and surgical options. Surgery consists of adrenalectomy and may be preferred if a ferret is in otherwise good health. 15 CBC, chemistry profile, radiographs, and ultrasound should be performed before surgery. A thorough abdominal exploratory should be performed with evaluation of both adrenal glands and excision of the affected gland. If both adrenal glands are affected, bilateral adrenalectomy is recommended. The right adrenal gland is adjacent to the caudal vena cava and when enlarged may invade the vena cava. Because of this close proximity or invasion into the caudal vena cava, complete excision of the right adrenal gland is often not possible. Reoccurrence may take place in the remaining adrenal gland or in any residual tissue left after a right adrenalectomy. 18 Male ferrets with prostatomegaly or prostatic cysts should have the prostatic cysts drained and marsupialized. 17 Whenever surgery is performed on a ferret, evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract, spleen, lymph nodes, kidney, and pancreas should be included.",

Studies have revealed reduction of plasma steroids, dramatic regrowth of hair, and reduction of vulvar swelling or prostatic size. 21 Other drugs that have been used to treat adrenal disease in ferrets include anastrozole (Arimidex), an aromatase inhibitor that lowers estrogen by converting adrenalgenerated androstenedione to estrone by aromatase in peripheral tissues 22 ; flutamide (Eulexin), which inhibits androgen uptake and binding in target tissues 15 ; and bicalutamide (Casodex), which competitively inhibits the action of androgens at the receptor site. 22 Flutamide and bicalutamide have been used in ferrets to reduce the size of prostatic tissue and diminish clinical signs of adrenal disease. 15, 22 INSULINOMA Pancreatic islet cell tumors are one of the most common tumors in middle-aged and older ferrets.

            "text": "Clinical illness due to renal disease is somewhat rare in ferrets, yet renal pathology is often seen on necropsy of older ferrets. 35, 36 Many ferrets over the age of 4 years have varying degrees of chronic interstitial nephritis on necropsy. Early lesions may be seen in ferrets as young as 2 years of age. The disease is often progressive with pathologic changes that may or may not lead to renal failure, and the cause of death is infrequently related to kidney disease. 37, 38 The most commonly reported pathologic changes in the kidneys of ferrets include interstitial nephritis and renal cysts. 35, 36 Other causes of renal pathology include Aleutian mink disease, toxins, urolithiasis, and neoplasia (Fig. 5) . 18, 36 Renal cysts are common in ferrets, although their etiology is unknown. Most renal cysts are not a cause of renal disease and are an incidental finding during ultrasound examination, at surgery, or on necropsy (Fig. 6) . 38, 39 Aleutian mink disease is a parvovirus that often presents as a chronic wasting disease in ferrets. It can occur in ferrets of any age. Clinical signs include weight loss, depression, posterior paresis, and anemia. The disease results in a marked inflammatory response that can eventually lead to glomerulonephritis and marked interstitial nephritis, which results in renal failure and death. 39 Several toxicoses have been reported in ferrets, including zinc, copper, and ibuprofen. Ferrets of all ages should be monitored closely when not confined to their cages to avoid potential ingestion of toxins. [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] Urolithiasis has been reported, but the incidence is reduced with the development of improved diets in ferrets. 37 Clinical signs of renal disease in ferrets are similar to other companion animals and include depression, lethargy, weakness, posterior paresis, anorexia, weight loss, muscle wasting, and polyuria/polydipsia. Physical examination may reveal emaciation, dehydration, pale mucous membranes, and irregularly shaped kidneys. 38 Initial diagnostics include a CBC, biochemical profile, and urinalysis. The biochemical profile may reveal hyperphosphatemia and elevated serum urea nitrogen. The creatinine in ferrets does not elevate markedly in renal disease. 35 In ferrets a creatinine of 2 mg/dL is significant. Other blood parameters that may be affected include an elevation in plasma proteins and a nonregenerative anemia. With plasma protein elevations, a protein electrophoresis or Aleutian disease testing should be submitted. Isosthenuria may be present on the urinalysis. 38 Additional diagnostics include radiographs and ultrasound. Radiographs may reveal changes in kidney size or shape. Ultrasound can confirm changes and determine if renal architecture is normal. Ultrasound-guided biopsies or fine-needle aspirates may aid in reaching a definitive diagnosis.",

Clients have often spent many hours caring for their elderly pet, strengthening this bond even further. This can make euthanasia a difficult decision for owners. Determining when the time is right to euthanize can be challenging. Discussing the quality of life of ferrets is important in helping owners determine if that time has come. Is the pet able to get around on its own? Is it eating? Is the pet playful or able to enjoy interactions with the client? Are there more good days than bad? Often owners ask if it is better to allow a pet to die at home or be humanely euthanized. If the animal is not in pain or suffering and has an adequate quality of life, keeping the pet home and allowing it to die of ''old age'' may be an option. But often these animals have debilitating disease and may have multiple diseases present that are uncomfortable if not painful to the animal. It is veterinarians' responsibility to discuss with clients the option of euthanasia as an alternative to days or weeks of suffering. Euthanasia can be a painless, gentle end to a long, happy life for many pets. Owners can be allowed to be present with their pet. Presedation may be necessary in some pets, and placement of an intravenous catheter reduces stress for the client and the pet. If euthanasia is chosen, offering burial or cremation services is often appreciated by grieving owners, as are remembrance items, such as clay paws and locks of hair.",
