Recent studies have shed light on the contribution of individual ISG effectors to the antiviral state, but most have examined those acting on early, intracellular stages of the viral life cycle. Here, we applied an image-based screen to identify ISGs inhibiting late stages of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We unraveled a directly antiviral function for the gene SERPINE1, encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). By targeting extracellular airway proteases, PAI-1 inhibits IAV glycoprotein cleavage, thereby reducing infectivity of progeny viruses. This was biologically relevant for IAV restriction in vivo. Further, partial PAI-1 deficiency, attributable to a polymorphism in human SERPINE1, conferred increased susceptibility to IAV in vitro. Together, our findings reveal that manipulating the extracellular environment to inhibit the last step in a virus life cycle is an important mechanism of the antiviral response. 632 Cell 160, 631-643, February 12, 2015 \u00aa2015 Elsevier Inc.",

The combined action of hundreds of expressed ISG proteins creates multiple lines of de-fense against viral infection. It is not surprising that different ISGs block different pathways and have varying potency against different classes of viruses (Schoggins et al., 2014) . Our knowledge of ISG effector functions has been somewhat biased toward inhibition of early replication stages, such as entry, or viral translation initiation. However, viral assembly and release have proven to be an Achilles heel for viruses and are the targets of therapeutic small molecules (influenza A virus [IAV] neuraminidase inhibitors; HIV-1 protease inhibitors) and intrinsic ISGs such as tetherin (Neil et al., 2008) or viperin (Wang et al., 2007) .",

Applying an approach that accurately monitors several rounds of viral replication in the presence of single overexpressed ISGs, we discovered a direct antiviral function of the well-known gene SERPINE1, which encodes PAI-1 (Ny et al., 1986) . We demonstrate that PAI-1 inhibits IAV maturation by targeting host proteases needed for viral glycoprotein cleavage and that this is physiologically relevant in natural proteolytic landscapes both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we link a human genetic polymorphism in extracellular PAI-1 production to enhanced IAV susceptibility in vitro.

Human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) were transduced with lentiviral vectors to express individual ISGs ( Figure 1A ). After 48 hr, cells were challenged with IAV WSN/33 (H1N1) at an MOI of 0.01. Red, transduced cells; green, infected cells; blue, DAPI-stained nuclei. (B) Effect of 401 single ISGs on IAV spread. ISGs inhibiting more than 2-fold SD in two independent screens are shown in red. Spread ratio, the ratio of infected cells at 24/8 hpi. A positive control for inhibition is a-HA antibody. (C) Confirmation assays for selected ISGs on A549 cells or primary NHBE cells. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SEM from n = 6 values in two independent experiments for A549, and n = 3 for NHBE cells. ''Spread ratio'' was calculated from the number of infected cells at 24 hr post-infection (hpi) relative to 8 hpi for each ISG ( Figures  1A and S1A ). The screen was performed twice, using independently generated lentivirus libraries ( Figure 1B) . a-HA antibody, with a spread ratio of $2, was a positive control, whereas empty vector controls had a spread ratio of 50 to 60 ( Figures S1C and 1B) . Nineteen ISGs reduced the IAV spread ratio to <20, greater than two SDs from the empty vector control in both screens ( Figure 1B and Table S2 ). Among these ISGs were several broadly acting antiviral factors involved in pattern recognition and IFN signaling, such as DDX58 (RIG-I), IFIH1 (MDA5), IRF2, IRF7, IL28RA (IFNLR1), inflammatory cytokines, CCL5 (RANTES), and broadly acting or IAV-specific inhibitors, such as IFITM3, Mx1, and BST2 (Schneider et al., 2014) . IFITM3 and Mx1 act early (IAV entry or replication), whereas BST2, also known as tetherin, prevents release of budding virus particles at the host cell surface. Although conflicting data exist on IAV inhibition by tetherin (Mangeat et al., 2012; Watanabe et al., 2011; Yondola et al., 2011) , it potently inhibited spread in A549 cells and was subsequently used as a positive control. We also identified a number of ISGs with previously uncharacterized antiviral activities: MAP3K14, ELF1, PMM2, FAM46C, TBX3, SCO2, CRY1, TNFSF10 (TRAIL), XAF1, MAFF, and SERPINE1 (serine protease inhibitor, member E1). We validated this set of genes with independently generated, high-titer lentiviral stocks and A549 cells, as well as normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE). All but FAM46C, which did not inhibit virus spread on NHBE cells, were confirmed as antiviral ( Figure 1C ). To exclude false positives due to cytotoxicity, we tested cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA damage, and cell death profiles by high-throughput microscopy (HTM) (Figure S1D) . We found that only expression of MAP3K14, the most potent hit in our screen, and TNFSF10 were cytotoxic relative to the empty vector control.",

We therefore focused on exploring the antiviral action of SERPINE1, encoding PAI-1. SERPINE1 expression inhibited spread of various clinical IAV isolates, including a derivative of a highly pathogenic avian H5 influenza virus, modified to remove the polybasic cleavage site in the viral hemagglutinin (Steel et al., 2009) , A/Vietnam/1203/2004(HALo) (H5N1), the pandemic A/California/04/2009 (H1N1), and an isolate of swine origin, A/sw/Texas/4199-2/1998 (H3N2) ( Figure 1D ). In multi-step viral growth kinetics, SERPINE1 expression reduced extracellular IAV WSN/33 titers $10-fold, comparable to inhibition by tetherin ( Figure 1E ). This versatile SERPIN family member has been implicated in many physiological processes, including regulation of fibrinolysis (reviewed in Declerck and Gils, 2013) . However, since an antiviral effector function of PAI-1 protein in the context of the intrinsic immune response is novel, we set out to determine its role in restricting IAV infection.",

            "text": "IAV Infection Enhances Secretion of PAI-1, which Is Both Necessary and Sufficient for IAV Inhibition We first studied the kinetics of SERPINE1 gene expression, as well as PAI-1 protein production and secretion. We compared A549 cells and the more relevant in vitro model of NHBE-derived, differentiated human ciliated airway epithelium cultures (HAEC), which mimic both the morphology and physiology of the airway epithelium in vivo. In A549 cells, SERPINE1 mRNA was slightly upregulated upon IFN-b stimulation and following infection with IAV WSN/33 ( Figure 2A ). This was not due to nonresponsiveness of A549 cells, since other ISGs were highly upregulated ( Figures S2A-S2C ). TGF-b is known to trigger SERPINE1 expression via the canonical Wnt/b-catenin pathway (He et al., 2010) . Indeed, TGF-b treatment of A549 cells strongly induced SERPINE1 expression with no or modest effects on ISG15, IFITM3, and BST2 mRNA levels ( Figures S2A-S2D ). Stimulation of SERPINE1 gene expression led to increased intracellular and extracellular levels of PAI-1 ( Figures 2B, 2C , S2E, and S2F). Consistent with PAI-1 being efficiently secreted, total PAI-1 levels in the supernatant were about 16-fold higher than in respective IFN-b-treated cell lysates at 24 hr (Figures 2B and 2C) . We observed apical secretion of PAI-1 by HAEC after either IAV WSN/33 infection ( Figure 2D ) or TGF-b treatment (Figure S2G) . Of note, even mock-treated A549 cells and HAEC constantly produced and secreted basal levels of PAI-1 that accumulated over time ( Figures 2B-2D ). However, PAI-1 is further upregulated by certain stimuli, including virus infection.",

We tested whether known HA-cleaving proteases might be direct targets for PAI-1 inhibition. PAI-1 inhibits protease function by forming a covalent, SDS-stable bond with the target protease, detectable in gel shift assays. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), a major target of PAI-1, formed a complex of $85 kDa with rPAI-1, but not in the presence of the PAI-1 inhibitor triplaxtinin ( Figure 3A ). TPCK-trypsin is another established target of PAI-1 and a prototype chymotrypsin-like serine protease (Olson et al., 2001) . To allow multiple rounds of IAV infection in cells lacking endogenous HA-cleaving proteases, such as A549, trypsin is typically added in low concentrations to the tissue culture medium. We readily detected PAI-1-trypsin complexes formed in vitro and their degradation products, which were again absent when triplaxtinin was added ( Figure 3B ). Furthermore, we identified human tryptase and human airway trypsin (HAT) as PAI-1 targets ( Figures 3C and 3D ). In contrast, we were unable to detect complexes of PAI-1 and furin, although this interaction has been previously reported (Figure S4) (Bernot et al., 2011) .",

In contrast, HPIV3 F is cleaved intracellularly by ubiquitous endoproteases such as furin. Using the spread assay and trypsin as protease, we found that HPIV3 was not inhibited by PAI-1, whereas IAV WSN/33 and SeV both exhibited reduced spread ( Figures 3E-3G) .

Further, we found that wild-type but not mutant PAI-1 inhibited TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage of both HA subtypes. In contrast, cleavage of H5 Vietnam , which is mediated by endogenous intracellular proteases such as furin, was not impaired by PAI-1 ( Figure 4E ). This result is in line with data from PAI-1-furin gel shift assays ( Figure S4 ) and from experiments with furin-dependent HPIV3 ( Figures S2H and S2I ), further suggesting that furin is indeed not inhibited by PAI-1. Finally, we examined the cleavage state of HA on HAEC. These cultures produce and secrete intrinsic airway proteases on their apical side; in fact, they have previously enabled identification of several proteases that cleave HA (B\u00f6 ttcher et al., 2006) . Addition of rPAI-1 to HAEC during IAV WSN/33 infection dramatically reduced HA cleavage, whereas addition of a-PAI-1 increased cleavage ( Figure 4F ). These findings are in agreement with our previous results demonstrating virus growth kinetics in HAEC ( Figure 2F ).

Serpine1 was transcriptionally upregulated in B6 mouse lungs upon IAV infection ( Figure 5B ). We also detected increasing levels of murine PAI-1 (mPAI-1) in mouse lungs over the course of IAV infection with a 10-fold increase at 5 dpi compared to PBS-treated B6 ( Figure 5C ). Both Serpine1 mRNA and mPAI-1 protein were undetectable in Serpine1 \u00c0/\u00c0 lung homogenates. IAV-infected Serpine1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice exhibited significant weight loss and succumbed to infection on average 1 day earlier than B6 parental mice ( Figures 5D, 5E , 5G, and 5H). This difference was not observed in mice infected with VSV control ( Figure S5A ). Despite the modest difference in survival, lung IAV titers at late times of infection were significantly elevated in Serpine1 \u00c0/\u00c0 (Figures 5F and 5I), which correlated with the levels of mPAI-1. Keller et al. (2006) used Serpine1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice to study the effect of influenza virus infection on thrombosis, and they found no impact of PAI-1 on IAV infection, as measured by the amount of viral RNA at day 4 dpi. However, given the role of PAI-1 in blocking viral maturation, the levels of infectious virus particles (Figures 5F and 5I) are a more relevant measure. Serpine \u00c0/+ mice exhibited an intermediate phenotype with respect to weight loss, survival, and murine lung PAI-1 levels, indicating a co-dominant effect of PAI-1 on IAV infection ( Figure S5B ). Serpine1 \u00c0/\u00c0 lungs were increased in size at 5 days post-IAV infection, with enhanced necrosis compared to lungs from B6 (B) BHK cells were transfected to express GFP as negative control, PAI-1 wild-type (SER1), or loss-of-function mutant (SER*) and then challenged with IAV Puerto Rico/8/1934 in the presence of TPCK-trypsin. Supernatants were harvested and assayed for infectivity by focus forming assay on MDCK cells and for viral RNA by qRT-PCR. Plaque assays were performed in duplicate with or without additional post-harvest incubation with TPCK-trypsin. Specific infectivity was determined by calculating the ratio of FFU to vRNA copies, and values were normalized to GFP control.

Bleeding into alveoli was slightly enhanced in infected Serpine1 \u00c0/\u00c0 lungs at 4 dpi, which might be expected given PAI-1's role in fibrinolysis ( Figure S5C ). Cytokine expression was elevated in IAV-infected Serpine1 \u00c0/\u00c0 lungs compared to B6 control lungs, indicating increased inflammation (Figure S5D ). In contrast, cytokine levels in uninfected lungs or in lungs from mice intranasally challenged with poly(I:C) were comparable between genotypes ( Figure S5E ). Thus, the increased weight loss and death observed in Serpine1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice during IAV infection cannot be simply attributed to a global upregulation of cytokines. Whereas cytokine levels began to decrease in IAVinfected B6 lungs at 5 dpi, suggesting a subsiding infection, they stagnated in Serpine1 \u00c0/\u00c0 lungs, indicating an ongoing infection in Serpine1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice.

            "text": "Accessibility to glycoprotein cleavage is a major determinant of IAV pathogenicity (Bosch et al., 1981) . Whether, and at what efficiency, an HA subtype can be cleaved by a given protease is determined by its cleavage site sequence. Highly pathogenic avian H5 and H7 HAs contain a multi-basic cleavage site, which makes them accessible to ubiquitiously expressed, intracellular proteases like furin (Bosch et al., 1981) . Hence, viral particles of these subtypes are immediately mature and infectious upon budding. Less pathogenic IAV HAs, in contrast, contain a single arginine residue in their cleavage site, which makes them dependent on cleavage by extracellular airway proteases, such as TMPRSS2. Variation in the amino acid sequence surrounding this arginine alters cleavage efficiency (Galloway et al., 2013) . Recent studies in TMPRSS2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice revealed a direct influence on pathogenicity of IAV strains relying on this protease (Hatesuer et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2014; Tarnow et al., 2014) . In the absence of TMPRSS2, IAV of H1N1, H3N2, or H7N9 origin were unable to spread from the trachea to the lungs, making the mice highly resistant. This was not the case for highly pathogenic H5N1 virus (Sakai et al., 2014) . Thus, sensitivity to PAI-1mediated inhibition (or inhibition by other protease inhibitors) will depend on the nature of the cleaving protease, as well as on the cleavage efficiency of a specific HA subtype by that protease ( Figure 5 ). In this regard, it will be interesting to determine whether the protease inhibitor PAI-1 has differential impact on pathogenicity of different IAV subtypes in vivo.",

This is significant because HA-cleaving proteases are often upregulated by IAV infection, skewing the protease-protease inhibitor balance in favor of the virus (Kido et al., 2012) . Thus, PAI-1 may tip the balance back toward the host. Its regulation by TGF-b might be particularly relevant during IAV infections because IAV neuraminidase can activate latent TGF-b (Carlson et al., 2010) . Other sources of TGF-b in the airway during infection include secretion by macrophages and by epithelial cells.",

Mucins are present in airways at constitutive levels but are upregulated during inflammation (Turner and Jones, 2009). We now add PAI-1 as an additional component of this extracellular barrier.

In parallel, infectious virus titers were determined by TCID 50 assay on MDCK cells. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM from n = 3 B6 or Serpine1 \u00c0/\u00c0 MTECs. Statistical significance was determined by two-way ANOVA. See also Figure S5 . In conclusion, we identify SERPINE1/PAI-1 as a host factor inhibiting IAV spread and show that PAI-1 mechanistically acts by blocking maturation of progeny IAV particles, thus reducing particle infectivity. Naturally occurring human genetic variations in PAI-1 impact the ability of IAV to spread from cell to cell, thus identifying PAI-1 as a candidate human gene that may influence susceptibility to IAV and the outcome of infection. In this regard, it will be of immediate interest to determine whether PAI-1 deficiency might be linked with the severity of human IAV infection. Finally, our work suggests that localized administration of PAI-1 to the respiratory tract might provide a new therapeutic approach for treating IAV and other respiratory viruses that require extracellular protease-driven maturation.",

A549 cells in 96-well plates were first transduced and then challenged with IAV WSN/33 at MOI 0.01. Due to varying transduction efficiency between the lentiviral stocks, the percentage of nontransduced cells was variable. IAV production from non-transduced cells masked potential inhibitory effects of ISGs and was eliminated by adding puromycin 1 hr prior to IAV infection. Lentiviral transduction was performed in duplicate plates for each ISG, where one sample was fixed after one round of replication (8 hpi), defining the number of initial producer cells, and the other after several rounds of replication (24 hpi). ''Spread ratio'' was calculated by dividing the IAV-infected cells at 24 hpi by 8 hpi for each individual ISG over empty vector-transduced cells (Figures 1A, S1A , and S1B) and yielded results that were stable over a wide range of transduction efficiencies ( Figure S1B ). Infected cells were detected by staining for IAV nucleoprotein (NP) and HTM ( Figures 1A, S1A , and S1B).",

Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the ThermoScript RT-PCR System kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA served as template for the amplification of genes of interest and the housekeeping gene (Hprt1) by real-time PCR, using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems), universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI-PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The fold increase in mRNA expression was determined using the DDC t method relative to the values in mock treated samples, after normalization to Hprt1 gene expression. Virus was quantified by qPCR for the Matrix gene; primer sequences can be found in Table S3 . Alternatively, virus was titrated on MDCK cells by the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ), by eight replicates of 10-fold serial dilutions, according to the Spearman-Karber method. Figure S1 . High-Throughput Microscopy Screens for Inhibitors of IAV Spread, Related to Figure 1 (A) Example of automated cell scoring from the HTM screen. Images show one representative out of 48 views per 96-well; original images from individual channels on the left (blue, DAPI-stained nuclei; red, transduced cells; green, NP-positive cells), and segmented images on the right (gray, nuclei; red, transduced cells; green, NP-positive cells). (B) Establishing the spread ratio as a stable measure of spread over a large range of transduction efficiencies. A549 cells were transduced with a dilution series of BST2-expressing lentivirus, or a high dose of empty vector, the latter yielding 90% of transduced cells. A/WSN/33 spread was determined as described in Figure 1A . (C) Establishing a-HA antibody to block IAV spread. A549 cells were infected with IAV WSN/33 for 24h, in the presence or absence of an a-HA antibody serial dilution, then fixed and stained for IAV NP. Shown are results from automated quantification, and representative images of two wells with the minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.125 mg/ml, or without a-HA are shown. (D) Cytotoxicity assays of selected hits from the screen. A549 cells in 96-well plates were transduced with high-titer lentiviral stocks, yielding 90% transduced cells. Cells were then assayed by HTM for (from top to bottom): cell survival/proliferation, by DAPI stain and cell count; apoptosis, by Annexin V stain; DNA damage, by staining for phosphorylated H2AX; and cell membrane integrity, by Sytox stain. Tamoxifen and staurosporine were used as positive controls, untreated and untransduced cells as negative controls. Representative images from the respective assays are shown on the right. (B) and extracellular (C) PAI-1 protein levels. (G). Extended Figure 2D , showing the amount of extracellular PAI-1 protein levels from HAEC after induction with TGF-b. (H). A549 cells were infected with HPIV3-GFP for 48 hpi in the presence of either rPAI-1 (1) or a-PAI-1 antibody (2), and virus spread was assayed by HTM. The number of infected cells was normalized to buffer (1) or IgG control (2). Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SEM from n = 4 independent experiments. Statistical significance relative to empty control was determined by t tests. (I). HAEC were infected with HPIV3-GFP in the presence of either recombinant stable human PAI-1 (rPAI-1, 1) or a-PAI-1 antibody (2), and buffer (1) or IgG (2) as controls. Progeny virus was collected from apical washes at the indicated times and rPAI-1 or a-PAI-1 were replenished after each wash. Virus titers were determined by TCID 50 assay. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SEM from n = 3 replicates. (A-D) Representative gel shift assays to test the formation of SDS-stable complexes of recombinant PAI-1 (rPAI-1) and furin. (A+B). 1mg of rPAI-1 was combined with increasing amounts of active recombinant furin (from abcam, A, and from NEB, B), and the mixture was separated on SDS gels followed by silver staining. Where indicated, Triplaxtinin was used at 3.3 mM to inhibit PAI-1. (C) . To establish conditions for furin-rPAI-binding, 1mg rPAI was combined with 0.1 U furin (abcam) in 100 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 1 mM CaCl 2 , with the addition 0.5% Triton X-100 at either 24 or 37 C for indicated times.",
