There are only small variations in myelin composition in different species and in different areas of the CNS (7); the membrane has a lipid molar ratio of cholesterol:phospholipid:galactolipid varying between 4:3:2 and 4:4:2 (Table 2.1) . Cholesterol is the most abundant lipid in myelin but the sterol is present in all other cellular membranes. Although not exclusive to myelin the most characteristic lipid is the galactolipid, cerebroside. Its concentration is directly proprotional to the amount of myelin in the brain (8). Another characteristic marker of myelin is ethanolamine plasmalogen. The ethanolamine phospholipid in the vinyl form is almost exclusively located in white matter (6). Small amounts of polyphosphosinositides (9) and gangliosides are also present in myelin. The monosialoganglioside GMI accounts for 80-90 mole % of myelin ganglioside (i0) in the rat, but an unusual ganglioside, sialosyl-galactosyl-ceramide (G 7) is a major component of human myelin gangliosides (ii).",

It is well established that myelin BP purified from brain or spinal cord of numerous species induces experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in laboratory animals (see Chapter h). It is a primary demyelinating disease ~ich results from a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to whole BP or encephalitogenic fragments derived from the BP. BP is susceptible to rapid and extensive digestion by trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin and pronase (18, 19) . Hydrolysis by enzymes of the brain and of phagocytic cells is more selective and a mixture of encephalitogenic and non-encephalitogenic peptides are produced. Brain cathepsin D has a special affinity for the peptide bonds of the two Phe-Phe sequences, h3-hh and 89-90, in the molecule (20) , and the same three peptides appear to be released by maerophage acid proteinase ( Fig. 2. 2). BP is also highly susceptible to digestion by the neutral proteinases of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells (21). Thus the enzymes endogenous to brain tissues may play a rate-limiting role in BP breakdown, while the relapse of fragments by cells of the immune systemmay be important in regulating the immune response in auto-immune disease. In addition to disease induction, BP gives rise to specific circulating antibodies (22) The lipid-free protein is not readily soluble in aqueous media, and requires detergents for solubilization. However, it can be readily succinylated to give a molecule which is soluble in a wide range of aqueous conditions. Analyses of SDS-protein complexes by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) has established a molecular weight of 30,OO0 for the major component and 25,000 for the minor component (DM-20) (2h). When the protein is prepared by column procedures, the majority of glutamate and aspartate residues are present as amides, which would result in a net basic charge on the molecule. The amino acid composition of PLP from different species is well documented but work on the sequence is incomplete. Information about the exact molecular shape of PLP is lacking, but in organic solvents the protein has a high helical content (25). Taking the molecular weight of the apoprotein as 23,500 dalton~ PLP in a spherical form has been calculated to have a diameter of about 38~ . The free sulphydryl groups appear to contribute stability to the secondary and tertiary structure of the PLP and in the native protein these are protected from oxidation by the anionic phospholipids (26). Because of its hydrophobic nature PLP is relatively resistant to proteolysis, but in the presence of the non-ionic detergent, Triton X-lO0, 80% of the expected digestion by trypsin takes place (27) . The oxidized crude proteolipid is more susceptible to tryptic digestion than the unoxidized preparation (28). Both apoprotein and the oxidized proteolipid are digested by thermolysin and e-chymotrypsin and all preparations are attacked by elastase.",

A different route of transport is proposed for phosphatidyl choline as the specific radioactivity of the lipid in the supernatant is always greater than in the microsomes (42). The phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidyl choline transfer activities in the soluble protein fraction prepared from synaptosomal and myelin fractions were found to be increased seven-and three-fold respectively, compared to whole brain.

It has been proposed that the myelin first laid down by the oligodendroglial cell has a composition which may be close to that of the glial cell membrane (46).

Myelination appears to be very restricted in the adult CNS when deposition of myelin ceases. This concept was supported by the finding of little enzyme activity within the myelin sheath, and in experimental studies turnover of myelin appeared to be exceedingly slow. For example, substantial amounts of labelled cholesterol were incorporated into the CNS of rabbits and chickens only during development. There was evidence that the same ~-14C~-cholesterol molecules remained for more than a year in white matter, while disappearing within a few months from Other organs as well as from grey matter. Similar results were obtained with ~4C~serine as a precursor. There was little loss of radioactivity from labelled components measured in whole brain or isolated myelin over a long interval, suggesting that myelin is stable and metabolized as a unit (47). In adult rat brain myelin accounted for only 12% of the total radioactivity 1 day after injection with ~4C~acetate, and after increasing to 15% by 5 days the the absolute amount remained unchanges throughout the experiment. The half life of the myelin fraction was found to be 370 days and in common with long term experiments in myelinating rats, at least 50% of the remaining total brain lipid radioactivity was present in the myelin fraction after 3 months. These results emphasize the higher turnover rates of fractions other than myelin. The fact that some radioactivity is taken up by lipids in adult myelin indicates that a small fraction of adult myelin undergoes rapid metabolism while the rest of the myelin lipid is relatively stable (48).",

A consequence of the axonal degeneration is secondary demyelination, and the biochemical findings reflect those of a wide variety of demyelinating conditions, i.e. reduction in the ~yelin proteins and in the major myelin lipids, cholesterol, cerebroside and sulphatide, and ethanolamine plasmalogen, and an increase in cholesterol ester. Cholesterol ester accumulation, in conjunction with raised lysosomal hydrolase activity, is indicative of active phagocytosis of myelin. When demyelinated tissue, containing cholesterol ester is fractioned by density gradient centrifugation a fraction, lighter in density than myelin, floats on the top of 0.32 M sucrose. This fraction is enriched in cholesterol esters and has a higher lipid to protein ratio than myelin. The time course of Wallerian degeneration is much slower in the central (CNS) than in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), because there is little evidence of cell infiltration from the circulation in the early stages after section. Although the yield of myelin from degenerated rat optic nerves is decreased, the isolated myelin appears to be morphologically and chemically normal (1), apart from a slight increase in cholesterol concentration, and a slight decrease in the amount of ethanolamine glycerophosphatides. These non-specific lipid findings have been seen in other demyelinating conditions. No preferential breakdown of myelin protein constituents occurs. The finding of normal protein and lipid composition in myelin isolated from r~% optic nerve 90 days after enucleation, is consistent with mor~lological evidence that myelin is not broken down until engulfed by macrophages. There is evidence that glial cells also participate in the phagocytosis of both the degenerating axon and the myelin sheath (2) . Demyelination in some experimental conditions is independent of inflammatory cells. Chronic administration of triethyltin to rats produces oedema in the CNS and severe paralysis. Myelin recovery is reduced by 25%, but is not accompanied by increased levels of cholesterol ester (3) .

At a later stage the oedematous lesion resembl=s histologically the acute MS lesion in that there is destruction of myelin with preservation of axon continuity and a cellular reaction with phagocytosis of myelin debris (5). In contrast to the situation in EAE, there is very little penetration of the sheath or stripping of myelin by cells. Remyelination in the spinal cord or optic chiasma by oligodendrocytes is not apparent after injection of the toxin. Conduction is completely blocked in large lesions and slowed in smaller lesions. There has been little biochemical investigation of the lesion in the CNS, but in the PNS, where the pattern of demyelination is similar, the effects of diphtheria toxin have been investigated in vitro (6). No detectable degradation of myelin proteins or Sulphatide in sciatic nerves of chick embroyos was found after incubation With diphtheria toxin in vitro for 4 hours.",

Under their conditions, incubation of myelin at physiological pH also resulted in endogenous breakdown of approximately 10% of the BP.

Vaccinia virus also contains a protein kinase, which is located within the viral core. A ten-fold increase in 32P-incorporation observed in vitro with added myelin BP, compared with core alone, has been shown to represent phosphorylation of the BP (39). Vaccinia virus can induce a demyelination and it has been suggested that direct viral action on membranes may be one mechanism of action. The enzyme is reactive with a range of BPs, and the relevance of phosphorylation of myelin BP with vaccinia virus protein kinase to demyelination remains to be determined.

Myelin appears to be vulnerable to attack by at least two neutral proteolytic activities, secreted by the macrophages, a plasminogen-dependent and a plasminogen-independent activity. In addition, the selective digestion of BP at pH 7.6 by intact lymph nodes cells has been reported (41). These reactions constitute a common mechanism of initial myelin destruction in inflammatory lesions, due to the remarkable sensitivity of BP to proteolysis. ",

Encephalitogenic activity is due to organ-specific but not species-specific antigenic constituents. Thus brain, spinal cord, the myelin basic protein or its active peptide fragments together with Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) (killed mycobacteria in paraffin oil) will cause neurological symptoms after intradermal injection. Following transfer of encephalitogenic antigen plus adjuvant into the lymph nodes, there is a short latent period when the mycobacteria stimulate and direct the immune reaction so that specifically sensitized cells are produced.

However in a monoantigenic system (BP), Lebar and Voisin (16) found that the levels of anti-BP antibodies (IgG l) measured by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) correlated with protection from the clinical symptomslwhile levels of complement fixing (CF) antibodies (IgG2) correlated with the severity of the lesions. Some of the CF IgG antibodies induced by BP or whole brain homogenate become attached to the CNS (17). Bornstein and Appel have demonstrated in rabbit EAE sera a CF antibody, which is able to demyelinate cultured brain Cells and inhibit primary myelin formation (18) . These factors, however, are induced by whole brain and not by the encephalitogenic BP of myelin. It has been claimed that the anti-myelin factors are anti-cerebroside antibodies in the rabbit (19) , but Lebar and co-workers have recently reported experiments which show that the demyelinating factor is an autoantibody of the IgG 2 class, which is directed against a myelin antigen that is not BP or cerebroside (20) . Cellular chan~es. Although in EAE there is no good correlation between morphological changes in the CNS and clinical signs there are marked fluctuations in circulating lymphocyte populations which correlate well with the severity of clinical signs. Traugott and co-workers (21) found that in contrast to circulating B cell and total T cell values, which show little change, early (active or high affinity rosetting) T cell levels show significant decreases which coincide with clinical worsenings in acute EAE. In the EAE animals clinical signs developed on the llth to 15th day post inoculation. The percentage of circulating active T cells fell at this time from 32.6 \u00b1 12.2% to about 4% prior to death. Throughout the period late T cells showed only minor fluctuations and B cell numbers were slightly elevated. EAE can be suppressed in strain 13 guinea pigs by injection, 7 days after sensitization, of bovine or guinea pig myelin BP. In suppressed animals, between day 17 and 23 post inoculation, transient clinical signs were apparent. Most animals recovered completely, but three out of the twelve had a mild relapse. During the period of clinical response (days 17-23), the percentage of early T cells decreased significantly to 23% of controls. With clinical recovery there was a return in early T cell population to slightly elevated numbers. In animals with later relapses there was a marked decrease in the percentage of early T cells from about 45% to 16%. It was suggested that there might be selective destruction of early T cells or that the loss of active cellsmay be due to migration into the CNS (which is known to be invaded by mononuclear inflammatory cells). Traugott and co-workers (22) next measured circulating active T cells and assessed the levels in the CNS using ultrasonication to release infiltrating cells from the meninges and surface of the spinal cord. Lymphocytes were not detected in the meninges of normal animals but in sick animals (days 13-24) there was a migration of lymphoeytes into the meninges (Table 4. 1) . A proportion of these were active cells and the percentage (42.4%) was higher than that found in the blood of normal guinea pigs (32.6%). There was no correlation between the percentages of early T cells in the meningeal cell suspensions and the severity of clinical signs. It was therefore concluded that the decrease of early T cells in the circulation was caused by their migration to the target organ, the CNS.",

Tourtellotte and Parker (27) have shown a positive correlation between the concentration of IgG in MS plaques and apparently normal white matter and the concentration in the CSF and concluded that the increase in the CSF was a reflection of an excess of IgG in the CNS. But a recent report suggests that in EAE in sheep, passive transfer of proteins from serum to CSF is the most likely cause of the protein and IgG increase (28). As EAE developed, the albumin to globulin ratio in serum and CSF became nearly identical, while in control animals the ratio was 4:i and 2:1 in CSF and serum respectively.

The increase in protein synthesis could be attributed to active synthesis in inflammatory cell. On the other hand, in studies of amino acid activation by tRNA synthesis in rabbit, there was a marked increase in activation of some amino acids in the early stages of EAE prior to cell infiltration.

In rodents, where inflammatory lesions in the CNS are not accompanied by extensive demyelination, activity of acid proteinase is increased 28%, neutral proteinase only 12% and cathepsin A 258% in comparison to controls. In the rat the lesions are microscopic and diffuse, consisting predominantly of lymphocytes and macrophages. Cathespsin A, the carboxypeptidase which acts synergistically with cathepsin D (acid proteinase) is considered to be a marker for macrophages as the specific activity of this enzyme in lymph nodes is 30 times that of brain stem. In the hyperacute microscopic lesions of the monkey, where inflammatory lesions contain PMN cells as well as macrophages, acid proteinase activity is increased by 159%, neutral proteinase (enriched in PMN cells) by 239% and cathepsin A by 400% of control CNS values. Myelin BP is highly susceptible to digestion by the neutral proteinases (elastase and cathepsin G) of PMN cells (35). None of these enzyme changes is seen before 7 days after injection with spinal cord, that is before the onset of clinical symptoms. Buletza and Smith found increased proteolytic activity throughout the pH range 3.5-8 in spinal cords from rats with acute EAE and the optimum pH for acid hydrolysis of myelin BP coincided with that of haemoglobin (36) .",

The activity of phospholipase A 1 was increased by approximately 35%, with the same order of magnitude for a wide range of diacylglycerophospholipids. Phospholipase A 2 has a higher affinity for the diacyl than the plasmalogen analogue and the activity was 25% higher in EAE brain. The activity of both enzymes returned to control level during the recovery stage. Another important myelin lipid is sulphatide, which can be hydrolysed by sulphatases. Vasan and Bachawat (39) have reported that arylsulphatases A and B in rat CNS show a maximal activity (3 x control) after the onset of EAE, with a rapid return to normal during the acute and recovery stage. These results agree with their earlier finding of increased incorporation of sulphate into sulphatide during the acute stage of EAE suggesting a higher turnover rate. The increase in arylsulphatase A activity during the acute stage of EAE, observed by Maggio and co-workers (40) was less significant with a slower rate of return to control values.",

To date one cannot conclude that acid and/or neutral proteinases initiate the process of demyelination as BP-deficient myelin has not been isolated from EAE or MS brains. However the increases in proteolytic activity are several fold greater than those of lipid degradative enzymes. The increments in enzyme activity in EAE brain are considered to be the result of entry of phagocytic cells into the CNS as a wide spectrum of lysosomal enzymes are affected, including 8-glucuronidase and acid phosphatase, and because the timing and extent of the enzyme increases correlate with the inflammatory response Summary EAE is a delayed hypersensitive condition in which active T-lymphocytes are an important part of the pathological reaction (for reviews, see 41,42). In the acute condition in rodents perivascldar cuffing is a predominant feature but unlike MS there is relatively restricted demyelination. Circulating antibody to the antigen-myelin basic protein affords protection rather than initiating a neurotoxic effect. With the onset of paralysis the level of active T cells decreases concomitantly with the appearance of such cells in the meninges of the affected guinea pigs. In rats developing EAE, there is the appearance of myelin fragments in the blood. Indirect evidence suggests that myelin BP or fragments in normal rats and animals with EAE may act as immunoregulatory factors, influencing development or susceptibility to this auto-immune disease. Whether endogenous myelin BP exerts such a putative immunosuppressive role by activating T suppressor cells is not clear. Although the clinical and pathological changes in acute EAE are not close to those seen in MS, the inflammatory reaction is of importance in both diseases. However, where EAE animals survive, a chronic remitting condition results which has a nearer resemblance to MS and this condition too can be suppressed by myelin BP (43). P.Y.

On histochemical grounds Ibrahim and Adams (7) considered them to be oligodendrocytes but they may be microglial phagocytes or infiltrating monocytes. Another possibility is that there are phagocytising astrocytes (8). Intact myelin fragments are rarely observed within such cells during demyelination (9). But cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of membrane-bound stacks of curved linear profiles, presumed to be a product of myelin degradation, have been observed in microglia in MS plaques (6). Another feature of the early lesion is the tissue oedema immediately outside the lymphocytic cuff, which appears to affect myelin lamellae and cells and emphasises the inflammatory nature of the process. Furthermore immunoglobulin-containing cells are significantly more numerous in plaques than in non-plaques and in recent plaques as compared with old plaques (i0) (5) Lymphocytic meningitis frequently accompanies active lesions (1, 5) . In his series of 151 cases of MS (19 acute and 132 chronic) Jellinger found inflammatory lesions in the meninges in 62 cases. In 80% of these active demyelination was a feature. The meningitis was characterised by lymphocytic and monocytic infiltrates, often enmeshed in a fibrin network. The number of lymphocytes in the sequestered meningeal areas within sulci often exceeded the number within the brain parenchyma and far exceeds the number of free cells in the CSF (1)( Table 5. 2).

The ether-lability of the isolates and the suggestion from neutralisation experiments of a possible antigenic relationship to C.D.V. and to a lesser extent to measles virus suggest that the agent might be related in some way to the paramyxoviruses.",

The reduced concentration of phosphatidal ethanelamine, the major myelin phospholipid, is balanced by increased amounts of lecithin. Appearance of cholesteryl esters is one of the hallmarks of demyelination for only traces of sterol esters are present in normal nervous ~issue. In early, active plaques, the cholesterol loss is accounted for by ester accumulation. The ganglioside content of plaques is increased on a dry weight basis and decreased on a wet weight basis (5). Increased extracellular space accounts for the latter result. The increase in dry weight concentration is consistent with the assumption that astrocytic elements contain more ganglioside than does myelin. Plaque gangliosides show many changes from the normal white matter pattern. The major myelin ganglioside, GMI , is decreased in plaques and there is complete absence of sialosyl galactosylceramide (G7) , the only ganglioside derived from cerebroside.

Lower levels were found in the centre of plaques, in \"normal\" appearing white matter some distance from the pl~ques, and in normal appearing grey matter. The degree of perivascular accumulation of mononuclear cells correlated directly with the degree of elevation. This data supported their hypothesis that proliferation of perivascular cells was sufficient, and probably necessary, to produce an elevation of gamma globulin in the brain tissue in MS. But it was possible that cells in the advancing margin of a plaque might also produce gamma globulin. In a further paper, they suggested that the elevated gamma globulin in the \"normal\" white matter could be due to diffusion of immunoglobulin synthesised in an active plaque. The increase in CSF globulin was likewise a reflection of excess globulin in the brain. The elevated globulin could be used as support of two theories about the aetiology of MS; namely that it is due to an autoimmune process or to a slow virus infection.",

In 1962, Baker and co-workers (17) extracted lecithin from white matter of MS cases in which recognizable plaque tissue was not visible to the eye. Analysis of the fatty acid composition showed that the proportion of saturated chains was increased and unsaturated chains decreased. Other workers have found differences with ranges from +2.3 to +6.1% for saturated and -0.2 to -8.3% for unsaturated fatty acids (18) . The increases were found in palmitic (16:0) and decreases in palmitoleic (16:1), oleic (18:1) and araehidonic (20:4) . Varying abnormal results have been found by other workers (19) although Ailing and co-workers (ii) found that the fatty acid patterns of the MS brains were strikingly similar to those of normal brains. Only minor changes were found in some white matter ester fatty acids. found small but significant alterations, in the serum lipid fatty acids. In particular, they found a reduction in linoleate (18:2) concentration, but reported no difference in linoleate concentration of fasting blood lipids when other neurological cases were compared to MS sufferers. However they confirmed that there was a difference between patients and healthy controls. It has been suggested by Thompson (19) that these changes indicate a widespread abnormality in the handling of certain fatty acids in the body of patients with MS. As a result of this hypothesis, long-term trials of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation in patients have been undertaken, with moderate improvement in the length of relapse in patients with progressive disease (22) . It is known that C18:2 and C20:2 are prec1~sors of prostaglandins and hence reduced synthesis of prostaglandins may be a feature of the disease. Possibly PUFA act as immunosuppressants and their clinical effect is related to this property. Clausen and M~ller (23) found an increased susceptibility to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and a more severe course of this disease in animals bred and raised on a PUFA diet. On the other hand dietary supplementation with PUFA exerts a protective effect (22),",

The test is based on the observation that peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with malignant diseases are sensitized to BP or to a purified protein derivative (PPD). Incubation of sensitezed lymphocytes with either of these antigens resulted in the release of a macrophage-slowing factor from the lymphocytes, whose presence may be detected by its effect on the electrophoretic mobility of guinea pig macrophages. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with MS appeared to be much more susceptible to the inhibitory activity of linoleic acid when tested for sensitization to PPD by the MEM test than are those from normal subjects (13,14) . These differences were claimed to be specific for MS and could be used as an in vitro diagnostic test for the disease. However, there have been conflicting reports on the value of the MEM test, both in the diagnosis of cancer (15, 16) and in the diagnosis of MS (17). A diagnostic test for MS with human red blood cells was then developed (18) . In this test, it was claimed that erythrocytes from patients with MS showed a significant reduction in their electrophoretic mobility in the presence of linoleic acid, whereas erythrocytes from other patients or normal subjects showed an increase in their mobility. The effect of linoleic acid on the electrophoretic mobility of red blood cells from both MS patients and normal subjects was studied by Stoof and co-workers (19) . An extensive statistical evaluation of the data clearly demonstrated that there was no difference in behaviour of red blood cells from patients and normal subjects in the presence of linoleic acid. Even a tendency for the mobility of erythrocyteE to be decreased in patients and increased in normal subjects after addition of linoleic acid was not observable. Similar observations were reported by Forrester and Smith (20) who found no change in erythrocyte mobility with linoleic acid.",

Since serum proteins are able to leak into spinal fluid as a result of damage to capillaries (e.g. plaques near the ventricles), corrrection must be made for the possibility of any such passive transfer by relating IgG values to another high molecular weight serum protein, e.g. macroglobulin or albumin. Thus Tourtellotte (21) corrects for a contribution from serum antibody by utilising the relative CSF and serum IgG and albumin concentration and applying these values in a correction formula.

The synthesized IgG had an oligoclonal distribution and showed the same electrophoretic pattern as the IgG of the original CSF (26). Blood lymphocytes from the same patients synthesized an IgG in vitro that showed a completely different electrophoretic pattern. Furthermore, the amount of IgG synthesized by blood lymphocytes was less than the amount synthesized by the CSF cells. These results demonstrate that at least part of the oligoclonal IgG of the CSF of MS patients is synthesized intrathecally and suggest ~ that the CSF cells are antigenically stimulated within the CNS in vivo. From the 500 ml of CSF formed and absorbed daily in a normal adult (21) it appears that the average MS patients' CNS produces an excess of about 16 mg of IgG per day (range 9-100 mg).

In the normal subject the IgG region of electrophoretically separated CSF has a diffuse homogenous appearance but in MS and in diseases of the nervous system where there is a known 'infectious aetiology' (e.g. mumps and herpes encephalitis, multifocal leukoencephalopathy or in sarcoid) a restricted heterogeneity of the IgG is seen. These oligoclonal bands of antibody (27, 28, 29, 30, 31) are relatively diffuse in themselves and probably represent the immunodominant antigens, each of which has stimulated several clones of lymphocytes to produce antibody. In some 90% of MS patients oligoclonal bands can be detected (29,32). In addition, in about 53% of patients (33) there is an alteration in the ratio of kappa:lambda light chains suggesting some abnormality in the nature of the IgG molecule. The kappa type proteins are more pronounced in MS and in conditions of chronic antigenic stimuli, e.g. herpes and measles. Free light chains, identified in the CSF of patients with subacute sclerosis panencephalitis (SSPE), were found in only a few MS patients (34). These free light chains may be After Link and Zettervall (33) derived from proteolysis of oligoclonal immunoglobulins synthesized within the CNS or there may be a defect in assembly of the complete antibody molecule. No change was seen in the y-globulin CSF pattern during a longitudinal study of the CSF of 4 MS patients by Vandvik (35), but a recent report suggests that the oligoclonal band pattern does alter during the course of the illness (36) .",

            "text": "Nature of the antibody and its specificity. The IgG isolated from both nervous tissue and CSF from MS and SSPE patients is mainly of the IgG 1 subclass (37). Oligoclonal measles-specific antibody can be isolated from sera, CSF and brain antibody in cases of SSPE and to a lesser extent from MS patients (38). In the latter case, the antibody eluted (about 20 mg IgG) from the serum and brain plaque tissue contained several bands of IgG. All 4 IgG subclasses were detected in the serum whereas only IgG 1 was found in the plaque. Using haemagglutinationinhibition tests and immuno-electrophoresis against unpurified cell-associated virus, the antigen cross-reaction was primarily with the IgGl subclass. However, measles virus antigen has not been identified in MS plaques, choroid plexus or in lymphocytes (39) and oligoclonal bands in the CSF are not absorbed out by measles virus antigen. When concentrated samples of CSF are analyzed, the IgG 2 and IgG 3 subclass proteins are found (40). IgG 4 can only be quantitated in the CSF of individuals having a relatively high serum IgG 4 content. Using specific antisera for each subclass it has been shown that all IgG subclasses are present in the CSF of MS patients and 'normal' individuals. Although the total IgG content of the CSF of MS patients is raised compared to the values obtained for the CSF from 'normals' this is not usually reflected in increased levels of IgG 3 and IgG 4. The increased IgG levels are predominantly reflected in increases in the IgG 1 subclass level. It appears likely that the observed increased IgG 1 levels are indicative of a selective local stimulation of antibody synthesis rather than selective transport across the blood brain barrier. CSF antibody directed against a variety of other paramyxovirus has been detected but these antibodies account for only a small proportion of the total and frequently are seen in other neurological diseases (41). CSF complement-fixing antibody reacting with crude MS brain has been detected by Laurell and Link (42) and by Ryberg (43) , but the proportion of such antibodies has not been established. Finer analysis of the antibody spectrum of CSF oligoclonal bands has been achieved by electrofocusing ( Fig. 7.1 ",

When antigenantibody complexes are phagocytosed by PMNL, a number of phlogistic substances are secreted, including proteases. Acid proteinase can degrade basement membrane and a battery of neutral proteinases are secreted, including elastase, collagenase, cathepsin G and lysoz3qne. PMNL constituents are thought to be involved in the activation of thrombin and complement, possibly at C1 and C S. Cationic froteins present in PMNL have bactericidal properties but they are also vasoactive and increase vascular permeability. Immune complexes also induce selective release of acid hydrolases from macrophages and in chronic inflammation plasminogen activator and lysozyme are actively secreted (24).",

NP was significantly elevated and acid proteinase (AP) lowered in patients with clinically definite MS who had suffered a relapse within the preceding month. There was no correlaticn between enzyme activity and the lesion site or degree of diability ( Fig. 8.1 ). Despite the difficulty of establishing an exact time relationship, in a longitudinal anaylsis of two cases, the rise in enzyme activity appeared to be preceded by a clinical relapse. The NP activity is predominantly located in the PMNL and the fluctuation of neutral and acid proteinase activity would not appear to be directly related to disease activity in the CNS itself but to relate to an extracerebral immune reaction, which could alter the functional properties of the PMNL. The alteration in NP activity suggests that an inflammatory reaction accompanies a relapse in MS. PMNL only appear rarely in the CSF during an exacerbation ef MS but using a highly sensitive method with radioactive basic protein as substrate it is possible to separate cells (probably macrophages or polymerphs) containing NP. Little NP activity was found in lymphocytes from the CSF; in comparison, NP activity of PMNL in infectious diseases of the CNS was proportional to the cell count. NP activity of the CSF cellular fraction was significantly increased in MS patients in relapse compared with those in remission although PMNL and macrophages were not identified in the CSF even in the low number (l-2/mm 3) which would account for the observed NP activity. The presence of increased lysozyme levels (26) (known to be secreted by PMNL andmacrophages) and the appearance of myelin fragments in the CSF of MS patients during an exacerbation are also indicative of inflammatory demyelination. Cohen and coworkers (27) and Whitaker (28) have reported an increase in basic protein or its fragments in the CSF which correlates with the clinical stage of the disease. is also an effective inhibitor of PEA-induced lymphocyte activation (30), and impairs lymphokine production or secretion (31) from sensitized lymphocytes by a feed-back control system. Defective sensitivity of the small lymphocyte to prostaglandins may be one way in which chronicity persists. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as Indomethacin) may not necessarily be acting at the most effective control point for the less active PG-synthetase inhibitor, acetylsalicylic acid, is a relatively successful drug in the treatment of the chronic disease, rheumatoid arthritis. Thus PG analogues may have a potential use in controlling chronic infl~mmatory conditions, such as MS.",

Both radioactive thymidine and myo-inositol incorporation into MS lymphocytes was decreased on stimulation by PHA and measles antigenic components.

This direct variation in T cells accompanied by an increase in unreactive cells further implicates cellular immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of MS. These workers suggest that the increasing proportion of unreactive cells in the CSF may be suppressed or tolerant myelinotoxic cells inactivated with a coating of antigen or antigen-antibody complex. In a prospective study of patients, Sandberg-Wollheim and Turesson (39) found an increased number of IgG-positive cells in the CSF, when compared with blood, and proportionately more T cells and fewer B cells. The significance of both these studies is subject to the limitations of techniques. It has not yet been possible to determine the percentage of T and B cells in normal CSF. But the percentage of B and T cells in peripheral blood is well-documented and a decrease in the relative and absolute number of T cells in the blood of MS patients has been reported by several groups (40,41).

The findings suggest that cellular immune reactivity to BP occurs in the CNS in MS and this relates to clinical activity in the disease. Lisak and Zweimau (42) measured the lymphocyte reactivity to BP by the incorporation of labelled thymidine into incubated cells. When data from stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes is compared to that for CSF-lymphocytes (Table 8 .3), it is possible to correct for variability in response of lymphocytes to BP. Increased thymidine uptake occurred repeatedly in CSF lymphocytes cultured with BP at a time when blood lymphocytes were non-reactive to this antigen in vitro. This contrasting pattern of reactivity was seen most commonly in cells obtained close to the time of acute exacerbation, to a lesser extent during the progressive stage of the disease and not at all during the remission period. There is increased uptake of thymidine in untreated CSF lymphocytes, suggesting a possible in vivo stimulatory effect during the course of the disease. This reactivity of the lymphocyte might be accounted for by endogenous stimulation of long-surviving lymphocytes or reflect entry of monocytes from the blood. It is of interest therefore, that although the MS peripheral blood lymphocytes show little and varied response to stimulation with BP, it has been reported that stimulation with a soluble antigen from MS brain gives clearer differences in a rosette test for active T cells (36) .",

Cytotoxic drugs such as methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist, or cyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent, suppress EAE in guinea pigs (3). These cytotoxic drugs act primarily at the proliferative phase after lymphocytes have contacted antigen but they can also moderate the blast reaction in target tissue as this also involves a burst of metabolic activity with active protein synthesis. The effect of ACTH and the corticosteroids on ~%Ehas also been the subject of considerable study. Moyer and co-workers (4) found that 5 mg ACTH given daily from the day of inoculation to the lhth day suppressed clinical signs of the disease in guinea pigs. This has been confirmed in other species. When administration of these agents is delayed until a week or more after sensitization with adjuvant and brain antigen or until the onset of neurological signs, no suppression of the disease is noted (5). Kabat and co-workers (6) therefore suggested that these various agents only inhibit the inflammatory reaction to the adjuvant at the local injection site and draining lymph nodes, a reaction which is essential for production of the disease. It is further suggested that ACT}{ or corticosteroids have no effect on the basic immune process within the reticuloendothelial system, or on the disease process once it has been initiated within the central nervous system (CNS). However EAE in rabbits can be suppressed by appropriate large doses of methylprednisolone when treatment is delayed to within a few days or less of the time of onset of the disease in control animals (5). There is even some experimental evidence of clinical improvement when animals are treated after the onset of EAE. The suppressive effect does not continue long after the drug is discontinued, probably due to the persistence of antigen. These studies suggest that ACTH and corticosteroids have an effect in EAE both on the basic mechanism within the the reticuloendothelial system amd to some extent on the disease process in the CNS.",

There is a parallel reduction in delayed-type cutaneous sensitivity to BP in these animals. This observation together with the importance of the dose of BP injected suggests that the underlying mechanism is desensitization of circulating effector lymphoid cells. In (2) some cases remission of the disease has been effected when BP in Freund's incomplete adjuvant is given after initiation of the disease symptoms. Other non-encephalitogenic, basic, neural proteins have a similar desensitization effect (8) as have modified non-encephalitogenic myelin protein or peptide fragments (lO). A peptide fragment, lacking tryptophan while producing circulating antibodies and delayed-type skin hypersensitivity to the BP, protects guinea pigs against EAE. Arnon and co-workers (ll) have used copolymers of amino acids (e.g. alanine, glutamic acid, lysine and tyrosine) and obtained protection against EAE in guinea pigs and monkeys. The possibility that BP may serve to desensitize patients with MS was examined some years ago with no convincing success (12). However no adverse reactions were observed with the very low dose used and there are new initiatives to study the effect of large doses (30-75 mg per day by intradermal in~ection) in several centres.",

It has been suggested that deficiency in brain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may alter membrane composition and increase susceptibility to disease. Clausen and M611er (13) showed that diet deficient in linoleic acid and other essential fatty acids potentiated the action of injected brain homogenates in producing EAE in rats. This was later confirmed by Selivonchick and Johnston (lh) who also showed that linoleate had a protective effect when fed to fat-deficient rats. These animals were fat-deficient from birth and therefore had a much more severe deficiency in brain and serum PUFA than is found in MS tissues. Since PUFA and their products (e.g. prostaglandins) may modify the immunological response linoleic supplements (0.5 ml/day) were fed to guinea pigs from 7 to 21 days after sensitization with adjuvant and BP (15). During this period there was a significant increase in serum linoleic acid concentration but no change in brain fatty acid composition. The treatment with linoleic acid had a mild protecting effect immediately before and during the time when clinical signs normally appear ( Fig. 9.1 ). Oleic acid used as a control also had a significant protective action. The increased oleic acid concentration may modify linoleate levels in the serum which would account for its biological activity. When linoleate supplements were given from 7 days before to 7 days after inoculation with BP (that is ceasing a week before the expected appearance of clinical signs), there was no significant protection. This suggested that linoleic acid effects are short-lived. Only the regimen which was effective in suppressing EAE brought about suppression in the in vitro immune response to BP. However Meade and co-workers (15) failed to correlate in vitro lymphocyte reactivity to BP in the treated animals with the degree of clinical signs. Linoleic acid has been shown to have a weak protective action on graft re~ection (16,17), and to suppress lymphocyte function in vitro (18) . One possibility is that increased amounts of the prostaglandins of the E series are formed from the linoleic acids. These prostaglandins have pronounced immunosuppressive activity.",

A clue to the nature of such an 'infective agent' could come from specificity studies on antibody found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients or from IgG isolated from affected post-mortem brain, and it seems possible that the agent may be one or more viruses, possibly of the paramyxovirus group. So far only a small proportion of the oligoclonal bands has been found to be directed against measles or other viruses but other types of antigen may be responsible. Little antibody to myelin basic protein has been detected though there are circulating antibodies to oligodendroglial cells Jn the blood during a relapse of MS. There are reports of an astrocytic response in apparently unaffected parts of the white matter but the earliest biochemical change in presumptive lesions is increased lysosomal activity with loss of the myelin BP. BP is highly sensitive to proteolytic attack and when fragments of it are released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the time of an exacerbation the antigenically active residues may serve to sensitize peripheral lymphocytes or alternatively to function as immunoregulators (1) . Some of the BP sequence is homologous with a fibroblast growth factor (2) and thus BP fragments may also be responsible for activating astrocytes in the region of the plaque. During a relapse the serum of MS patients contains an unidentified complement-dependent antibody which has been shown in vitro to have a neuroelectric blocking activity. This factor may be responsible for some of the reversible signs seen during the course of the disease. Many MS sufferers possess a characteristic tissue antigen type which is possibly associated with a difference in the nature of the immune response of the individual compared to unaffected controls. Thus in MS patients, there are apparent defects in the delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Indeed, changes in the kappa:lambda ratio of CSF antibodies may also indicate some defect in immunological regulatory mechanisms.",

There is the concomitant appearance in the CSF of cell bound neutral proteinase activity and release of lysozyme. The cellular i~nune response seems to be particularly important for sensitized T cells are found in raised concentration in the CSF of MS patients close to a relapse. These findings on the delayed hypersensitivity reaction have drawn attention to the relevance of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a model of the inflammatory reaction component in MS. The finding of a relapsing remitting type of chronic EAE adds to the significance of this as an experimental tool. Nevertheless, there are important differencesfor example, the non-involvement of the myelin BP in the induction of the initial lesion in MS and the relative lack of demyelination in the acute EAE (but not in the chronic condition). There is also intriguing evidence of clinical signs in acute EAE being dissociated from the presence or absence of neuropathological lesions (Table 10 .1). Although the inflammatory reaction is only one factor in the pathogenesis of MS and perivascular cuffing is not invariably associated with demyelinating lesions it may be possible to alleviate a relapse by using drugs which have proved effective in suppressing EAE. Apart from those immunosuppressants already tested in clinical trials there are now new anti-inflammatory drugs which act at different points in the inflammatory reaction. Some substances (e.g. prostaglandin synthetase inhlbitors) may actually increase disease activity but others, for example, those selectively acting on T-lymphocytes or substances stimulating prostaglandin synthesis, may prove of value. Unfort~lately it is unlikely that any such treatment would be effective in chronic MS cases where degenerative change already predominates. ",

The fragment was absent in 29 patients with stable disease. The pleocytosis noted in many of the acute phase patients was predominantly mononuclear but in half of the CSF's PMNL were also present ( (28) L~mphokines and prosta61andins. Although both lymphocytes and macrophages have been shown to be capable of direct cell-mediated cytotoxicity, chemical mediators are also involved: lymphokines, lysosomal enzymes and prostaglandins (29).Lymphokines are a mixture of soluble, highly biologically active factors secreted by stimulated lymphocytes. They are critical to the delayed hypersensitivity reaction e.g. increasing vascular permeability in vivo, ibibiting macrophage and PMNL migration, as well as stimulating macrophages. There is increased formation and secretion of lysosomal enzymes, which damage tissue in chronic inflammation. Prostaglandins, particularly of the E series (PGE1), are secreted by macrophages and potentiate the inflammatory response of delayed hypersensitivity.But PGE 1",
