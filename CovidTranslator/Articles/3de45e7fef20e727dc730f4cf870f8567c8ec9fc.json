The full-length wild-type COXII produced as a result of suppression allows the mutant strain to grow with a \"leaky\" phenotype on non-fermentable medium. In order to elucidate the factors and interactions involved in this translational suppression, the strain with the frameshift mutation was mutated by MnC12 treatment and a large number of mutants showing restriction of the suppression were isolated. Of 20 mutants exhibiting a strong, restricted, respiration-deficient (RD) phenotype, 6 were identified as having mutations in the mitochondrial genome. Furthermore, genetic analyses mapped one mutation to the vicinity of the gene for tRNA pr\u00b0 and two others to a region of the tRNA cluster where two-thirds of all mitochondrial tRNA genes are encoded. The degree of restriction of the spontaneous frameshift suppression was characterized at the translational level by in vivo 3SS-labeling of the mitochondrial translational products and immunoblotting. These results showed that in some of these mutant strains the frameshift suppression product is synthesized to the same extent as in the leaky parent strain. It is suggested that more than one \u00f7 1 frame-shifted product is made as a result of suppression in these strains : one is as functional as the wild-type COXII, the other(s) is (are) nonfunctional and prevent leaky growth on non-fermentable medium. A possible mechanism for this heterogenous frameshift suppression is discussed.",

Sakai * Present address.\" Division of Biology, 156-29, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA frameshifting or spontaneous suppression of frameshift mutations. This inaccuracy often has a strong sequencespecific nature and in some mRNA contexts doublet or quadruplet decoding takes place with an efficiency of up to 50% (Spanjaard and van Duin 1988) . In some instances site-specific frameshifting is required for expression of several genes, for example, for the ~ subunit of DNA polymerase III (Tsuchihashi and Kornberg 1990) , release factor 2 of Escherichia coli (Craigen et al. 1985) or reverse transcriptase of retroviruses (Jacks and Varmus 1985; Jacks et al. 1987; Jacks et al. 1988b) . A series of experiments involving in vitro mutagenesis has revealed the importance of features of the mRNA for such shift events. Examples are the presence of Shine-Dalgarno sequences in a reading frame ), runs of a single base in the mRNA sequence (Brierley et al. 1987) , or downstream hair-pin or pseudoknot mRNA structures (Jacks etal. 1988a; Brierley et al. 1989 ). On the other hand, genetic approaches, in which several intergenic suppressors were isolated and characterized, have also shown that mutations in the translational apparatus (tRNAs, EF-Tu, ribosomes) can cause non-triplet decoding to some extent (Hughes et al. 1987 ; for review see Murgola 1985) .",

In particular, the + 1 frameshift mutation M5631, which results in a run of six instead of five Ts in the reading frame for cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COXII), can be suppressed spontaneously to a significant extent to produce functional COXII (Fox and Weiss-Brummer 1980) . As a result of the suppression, the mutant strain is able to grow on nonfermentable medium, thus exhibiting a \"leaky\" phenotype. An alteration in the tRNA gene seri Hfittenhofer et al. 1990 ) can enhance the frameshift suppression, which leads to an increased growth rate on non-fermentable medium. Conversely, a mutational change in the mitochondrial 15S rRNA gene (par]34) can reduce the efficiency of suppression, causing reduced production of the full-length COXII and thus restricting growth on non-fermentable medium (Weiss-Brummer and Htittenhofer 1989) . The influence of these mutations indicates that frameshift suppression is a multifactor process and the RNA components of the translational system participate functionally in reading frame maintenance during protein synthesis.",

Six mitochondrial mutations were characterized genetically in this study to gain insight into the possible functional interaction of the RNA components during translation. The reason for the selection of yeast mitochondrial mutations is that all RNA components of the mitochondrial translational apparatus (tRNAs, rRNAs and mRNAs) are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, while the protein components, except for ribosomal protein Varl, are encoded by the nuclear genome (for review see Tzagoloff and Meyers 1986) . Genetic localization of these mitochondrial mutations was achieved by rhodeletion mapping. Their loci, which all mapped to regions of the mitochondrial genome encoding several tRNAs, revealed that more than one tRNA may interfere in one frameshifting event. Protein analysis of these mutants allowed us to construct a model for the \u00f7 1 frameshifting in which heterogeneous translational products are synthesized.",

This translational suppression was observed originally as a leaky growth phenotype on non-fermentable medium. The suppressed phenotype is only apparent when the mutant strain is crossed with a strain possessing the wild-type nuclear alleles for respiratory function (PET+), which complement the recessive nuclear opl mutation (pet-) of 777-3A-M5631. The phenotype of the diploids on non-fermentable medium was used here as the first criterion for isolation of strains with restricted suppression of the frameshift mutation; single colonies of 777-3-M5631 that had been mutagenized with MnCI2 were crossed with KL-0, which is a P E T + strain and possesses no mitochondrial genome (rho\u00b0). The rho \u00b0 state of the cross partner allowed the direct selection of the desired mutants based upon their phenotype, since all diploid progeny of the cross have acquired the mitochondrial genome of the mutated strains with the original frameshift mutation M5631. Colonies showing a more reduced respiration capacity or an RD (respiratory-deficient) phenotype on non-fermentable medium were selected. In the following step, strains carrying second-site mutations specific for frameshift suppression were isolated. The selection was based on the criterion that a specific second-site mutation should have its effect only in combination with the first frameshift mutation; mutants which have lost the first frameshift mutation should grow normally on non-fermantable medium. For this purpose the mitochondrial frameshift mutation was replaced by the wild-type allele through a rho-cross with strain C45s-1 (see Fig. 2 ). This strain carries an extensively deleted mitochondrial genome (rho-) retaining only a short region of the gene oxil with the wild-type allele of the M5631 mutation. A rho + recombinant ge-home resulting from the cross consequently possesses no + 1 frameshift mutation in the oxil gene.",

Two other mutations, HC248 and HC301, showed a high output of leaky progeny (22.8% and 16.2%, respectively), which indicates that the corresponding loci are unlinked and separated by tens of kilobases in the yeast mitochondrial genome (Dujon 1981 ) (see Fig. 3 for a summary of the results shown in Tables 3 and 4).",

Besides the truncated 12.5 kDa product synthesized by regular triplet translation of the + 1 frameshift message, the 32.5 kDa product corresponding to full-length COXII was generated in the leaky strain. The 32.5 kDa product results from the spontaneous suppression of the frameshift mutation. The suppression rate (32.5 kDa/12.5 kDa + 32.5 kDa) is about 26%, based on densitometric measurements of the autoradiograms and taking into consideration the different numbers of radioactively labelled cysteine and methionine residues in the two products. Protein analysis of the mitochondrial HC mutant strains revealed that the 32.5 kDa suppression product was also synthesized in all of these strains to a considerable extent. The greatest reduction in the amount of the 32.5 kDa product was seen in strains HC440 and HC441, which had about one-half the amount seen in the leaky original strain (13%-14%). Strains HC301 and HC315 show a reduction of about one-quarter (18%-22%). HC31 and HC248 caused no significant reduction, rather they showed a slight increase in suppression rate (25%-30%). These results appear to contradict the simple expectation based on the restrictive phenotypic effect of the HC strains on frameshift suppression. To examine the possibility of artifacts caused by the use of cycloheximide during protein radiolabeling, the COXII suppression product was assayed by Western blotting of total mitochondrial proteins extracted from cells that had been The results presented in Fig. 4 C reveal that the 15 kDa protein could not be precipitated by either serum.

The amount of the product is not reduced in strains HC31 and HC248. The 32.5 kDa protein was also identified by immunoblotting in these strains grown on non-fermentable medium. Thus, the appearance of aSS-labelled mitochondrial translational products is not an artifact resulting from, for example, labeling in the presence of cycloheximide. One reasonable explanation for all these results is that more than one kind of 32.5 kDa product might be synthesized as a result of the shift suppression of the oxil message containing the + 1 frameshift mutation.

This region comprising 9 amino acid residues upstream and 11 residues downstream from the +1 mutation siteis characterized as a transmembrane domain strongly conserved during evolution (Capaldi et al. 1983 ). The first amino acid residue changed by the mutation is proline, which is totally conserved in COXII from the procaryote Paracoccus denitrificans to plants, fungi, and lower and higher animals (see Fig. 6 ). As in the case of bacteriorhodopsin, in which the proline residues play an important role in transmembrane proton pumping (Mogi et al. 1989) , this residue should be subject to positive selection pressure. Hence, the translational suppression should cause the incorporation of the proline at this site in order to generate the functional COXII and the leaky phenotype. Thus, the prolyl-tRNA is the tRNA that probably decodes the first codon after the + 1 mutation site and shifts in the direction + 1. On the other hand, if some aminoacyl-tRNA(s) other than prolyl-tRNA could decode and shift + 1 at the same site, non-functional COXII protein(s) with the same length as the wild-type COXII would be produced.",

After + 1 shift the prolyl-tRNA in the A-site position encounters its cognate codon. Note that the peptidyl (phenyl)-tRNA positioned in the P-site interacts cognately both before and after the shift. Anticodon loop sequences are according to Sibler et al. (1986) and H/ittenhofer et al. (1990) UCC is moreover quite rarely used in yeast mitochondria. In a total of 2167 codons in all except then unassigned reading frames UCC appears only once (Sibler et al. 1986 ). The tRNA ~e~l, which is a unique tRNA cognate to UCC, prefers to read codons UCA (75 of 2167) and UCU (40 of 2167) indicating it is difficult to decode UCC. A certain correlation between rare codons in highly expressed genes and shift events has been demonstrated in E. coli (Curran and Yarus 1989) . The rarity of the first mutated codon is probably one reason why the frameshift mutation is suppressed so efficiently. Non-triplet decoding by prolyl-tRNA and some other(s) must compete with the cognate seryl-tRNA for the codon UCC. A reduction in the concentration of prolyl-tRNA in mitochondria will lead directly to restriction of the + 1 shift that generates the functional COXII shift product. That a change in concentration of certain aminoacyl-tRNAs can cause a frameshift event has already been shown in vitro, as well as in vivo, in systems in which competition between a cognate and non-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA for a codon presented in the A-site on ribosomes has been demonstrated (Atkins et al. 1979; Weiss and Gallant 1986) .",

            "text": "The nature of the HC301 mutation could fit this model, as it was mapped to the region of the gene for tRNA p~\u00b0 in this work. However, further DNA sequence analysis has revealed that HC301 is not located in the area of the mapped region that is transcribed and en-codes genes, which extends for 2 kb from 100 bp upstream of the gene for tRNA fmet to 0.5 kb downstream of the gene for tRNA pr\u00b0 (Sakai 1989 ). In the same work it was shown that the HC301 locus is linked with a recombination frequency of 8% to the paF434 locus of the 15S rRNA gene located about 6 kb downstream of the tRNA pr\u00b0 gene. This indicates that HC301 is situated in the 2 kb spacer region downstream of the gene for tRNA pr\u00b0. As shown here, HC301 affects the amount of transcription of tRNA p~\u00b0, reducing it to 70% of the original strain. The action of the mutation on the suppression is therefore probably through reduction of the concentration of the tRNA pr\u00b0 that normally competes with tRNA \"r~ and suppresses the frameshift.",

This mutation, mfs-1, located in the anticodon stem affects the frameshift suppression positively, allowing the mutant to grow in a quasi respiratory-competent manner Hfittenhofer et al. 1990 ). Interestingly, this mutation does not cause significantly increased synthesis of the 32.5 kDa COXII suppression product (H. Sakai, unpublished data) . Previously, it was assumed that the mutation could facilitate the + 1 shift by itself. On the basis of the above discussion it is, however, plausible that mfs-1 may reduce the ability of tRNA s~rl to decode the rare codon UCC and this in turn allows the competitor tRNA p~\u00b0 more opportunities to misread and shift at UCC and generate the functional COXII with the conserved proline residue. Furthermore, tRNA ~er~ itself could also induce a + 1 shift to generate the non-functional 32.5 kDa product. This is not only because tRNA ~erl decodes the 0-frame codon UCC very rarely, but it might also pair excellently with the + 1 codon CCA through 33U grapple pairing, as discussed by Hiittenhofer et al. (1990) (see Fig. 7 ).",

            "text": "The mapping of mitochondrial HC mutations to other tRNA gene regions further indicates the involvement of different tRNAs in interference with the suppression of one frameshift mutation. HC315, HC440 and HC441 especially, which were mapped to a region encoding several tRNAs, show one particular mitochondrial translation phenotype: appearance of a 15 kDa \"sub\"product. Since the product is specific to the frameshift mutation, it should be generated through aberrant translation downstream of the mutation site. Considering all the reading frames of the downstream region, it is only possible if read-through takes place at the stop codon of the oxil-M5631 message, keeping the same + 1 shifted reading frame. In this way the 12.5 kDa fragment can be extended by 17 amino acid residues resulting in a total molecular weight of 15 kDa. This presumed 15 kDa protein consists of 134 amino acid residues, of which 46 residues, i.e. more than one-third, do not exist in the wild-type COXII sequence. This is perhaps the reason why the protein is not recognized by two different antisera. That these three HC mutations have the same translation phenotype is interesting, because HC315 has a genetic localization distinct from that of HC440 and HC441. This again suggests that multiple factors (tRNAs) could be involved in one suppression event. Further identification of the primary structure of these mutations would contribute to the clarification of the mechanism of their effects on the frameshift suppression.",
