AppL Pharmacol. 111, 13-23. Studies were undertaken to address the necessity of B-T cell contact for the enhancement of B cell differentiation caused by the heavy metal lead (Pb). Membrane segregated cultures were used so that the influences of direct B-T cell contact and T cell factors on B cell differentiation could be independently evaluated. B-T cell contact was not absolutely required for Pb's enhancement orb cell maturation to antibody forming cells (AFCs); however, enhancement of the AFC response by Pb was optimal when B-T cell interactions were allowed. These results were corroborated by use of anti-L3T4 (mouse CD4) to block CD4 + T cell-B cell interaction. Blockade of B-T cell contact with anti-L3T4 did not inhibit the enhancement of the AFC response by Pb. Additional experimentation showed that Pb enhanced the AFC response and Ig production in the presence of antigen-specific T cell help, suggesting that Pb enhances B cell differentiation by augmenting cognate help rather than by inducing a response to Pb-altered-self. In studies employing antigen-specific T cell clones, Pb was found to differentially modulate antigen presentation to Tm versus TH2 T cell clones, in that THI activation was inhibited and Tn2 activation was enhanced by Pb.",

Helper (CD4 \u00f7) T cells act by two distinct mechanisms (Abbas, 1988) : cellto-cell interactions mediated by Ia restricted B-T cell collaboration and factor-mediated help fulfilled by T-cell-derived cytokines including interleukin-2, -4, -5, -6, and interferon-3, (IFN-7). Furthermore, factor-mediated T cell help has been categorized by the profile of cytokines present in supernatants of various CD4 \u00f7 T cell clones (Mosmann et aL, 1986) . Type 1 (Trfl) clones produce IL-2 and IFN-3,; whereas, THe clones produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6. THI and TH2-1ike cells, termed inflammatory and helper T cells, respectively, may exist in vivo (Bottomly et al., 1989) . Like their in vitro counterparts they differentially regulate immune responses through effector functions attributable to the cytokines that they secrete. Preferential perturbation of either subset may be protective or immunopathologic (Scott et al., 1989; Finkelman et al., 1986) .",

These studies suggest that Pb augments factor-mediated T cell help by enhancing factor production by T cells as well as B cell responsiveness to these factors. Furthermore, the results suggest that Pb enhances B cell differentiation by promoting cognate B-T cell interactions via heightened B cell surface Ia density rather than a T cell response to Pbaltered-self. Interestingly, a dichotomy between the influence of Pb on THt vs TH2 activities has been observed that may explain the inverse effects of Pb on host resistance and the posited influence on autoimmunity (Lawrence, 1985) .",

Pb-pretreated B cells placed in the upper chambers did not significantly modify the AFC response of splenocytes in the lower chambers suggesting that the Pb did not dissociate from the upper chamber B cells and modulate the lower chamber response. Overall, the data suggest that Pb augments the AFC response by enhancing the production of putative helper T-cell-derived factors from lower chamber cells as well as the responsiveness of B cells to these factors. In addition, it is likely that Pb enhances the production of T-cell-derived factors by potentiating B-T cell interaction (i.e., cognate help). The magnitude of the enhancement in the upper chambers correlated with the activation stage of the responding B cells; that is, Pb increased the AFC response of resting B cells (Row 4) to a greater extent than unseparated B cells (Row 1) or activated B cells (Row 5).",

            "text": "The present study was undertaken to determine the mechanisms by which the heavy metal Pb enhances T-cell-dependent B cell differentiation. Although Pb is known to enhance the in vitro production of antibody (Lawrence, 1981a,b; Warner and Lawrence, 1986a) and directly activate B cells (McCabe and Lawrence, 1990) , the influence of Pb on B-T cell interactions has not been clearly delineated. It was discovered ( Table 1) direct B-T cell contact was not permitted, although optimal enhancement of the AFC response by Pb occurred when B-T cell contact was permitted. Hence, it appears that Pb enhances both cognate helper T cell activity as well as factor-mediated T cell help. Furthermore, with regard to the effects of Pb on factormediated T cell help, it appears that Pb influences the production of factors by T cells, which likely is related to the effect of Pb on cognate interactions and subsequent T cell activation. Presently, the identities of the T cell factors, which may be any of the well-characterized interleukins or combinations thereof, are not known. It has been previously reported that Pb can enhance in vitro generation of lymphokdnes by T cells (Warner and Law-rence, 1988) . Pb also appears to enhance B cell responsiveness to the T cell helper factors, in that the upper chamber Pb-pretreated B cell response (in the absence of cognate T cell help) was enhanced. This suggests that Pb may influence B cell expression of surface receptors for particular interleukins. At present, this is a matter of conjecture since we have not measured Pb effects on interleukin receptor density on B cells. It is conceivable that Pb could modulate the surface density of interleukin receptors on B cells since Pb has been shown to modulate the cell surface density of other important molecules on B cells such as Ia, CD23, and sIgD (McCabe and Lawrence, 1990) . The ability of Pb to increase B cell surface Ia density is consistent with the interpre- tation that Pb promotes cognate T cell help, in that Ia molecules mediate B-T cell interactions (Katz et al., 1975) and increased Ia expression has been indicated to enhance the immune response (Matis et al., 1983) . Experiments to determine whether factor-receptor systems are influenced by Pb should be undertaken to shed more light on how Pb enhances the responsiveness of the B cell component of the immune system. The present understanding of how B cell differentiation is controlled by endogenous factors and normal cellular interactions, let alone how environmental factors such as Pb may influence these processes, is far from clear. However, it has become clear that after antigen-specific stimulation of the appropriate B cell and T cell clones, the ensuing immune response leading to antibody production is controlled by an intricate network of nonspecific factors and cellular interactions. Our data suggest that environmental factors such as Pb can influence the immune response by modulating these nonspecific regulatory components rather than creating neoantigens that may be recognized in a specific way by the appropriate lymphocytes. This influence by environmental factors on the regulation of the immune response perhaps is more difficult to envision than a direct modification of \"self,\" but it is likely to be of paramount importance with respect to the influence of toxicants on autoimmune disease and host resistance to pathogens and neoplasia. Furthermore, such modulations may be more ubiquitous, in that they may result from modification of similar biochemical processes in different organ systems.",

            "text": "It seems odd that a highly toxic metal enhances humoral immunity. Nonetheless, enhancement of inappropriate immune responses certainly are not beneficial since they may progress to autoimmune disease. Furthermore, enhancement of particular responses may result in dysregulation of the appropriate responses or may prevent them from occurring altogether. This is especially interesting in the cases of immune responses dominated by one or the other helper T cell subset (Tin and THe cells). Modulation of Tin vs TH2 activity in vivo has been implicated in various immunopathological states, most strikingly with protozoal and helminth infections (Scott et al., 1989) or the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Finkelman et al., 1986) . In ad- dition to the categorization of TH1 and TH2 cells based on their intefleukin activities (Mosmann et al., 1986) , these CD4 + T cell subsets differ in several other important aspects. Recent information indicates that the biochemistry of T HI cell activation differs from that of Tin cells (Gajewski et al., 1990; Munoz et al., 1990; Betz and Fox, 1991) which may be mechanistically related to the differential effects found with Pb. The differential effects of Pb on the CD4 + T cell subsets may involve cAMP since these subsets have been reported to have differential sensitivities to cAMP (Munoz et al., 1990) , and Pb and cAMP have been reported to synergistically modulate lymphocyte activity (Lawrence, 198 lc) . Additional studies are needed to elucidate the biochemical mechanism(s) whereby Pb affects lymphocytes and TH1 and TH2 cells in particular. The observed differential effects of Pb on the Tm and TH2 clones may provide some clues about the interleukin activities that Pb influences in regard to the enhancement of antibody production. Since TH2 clones are considered to be the optimal helpers for B cell responses (Janeway et al., 1988) , it is not surprising that Pb enhances TH2 activity and B cell differentiation to AFC formation and Ig production. Tm clones and their associated cytokines can influence B cells, in that they can to a limited extent support polyclonal but not antigen-specific B cell differentiation. Pb did not impart on Tul clones the capacity to support antigen-specific B cell differentiation (data not shown). Furthermore, in contrast to its influence on allo-reactive polyclonal Tm activity, Pb inhibited the limited polyclonal B cell response supported by the Tm clone, M264-37, a result consistent with the fact that Tm cells, which aid only at a high cell density, are not efficient helpers of B cell differentiation. In light of the differential effects of Pb on the helper T cell subsets, it is interesting to note that Tm cells require a higher density of \"processed antigen\" to be presented for their activation (Janeway et aL, 1988) .",

Listeria, an intracellular pathogen, is controlled mainly by Tm cells in vivo. If Pb decreases Tm activity in vivo less macrophage stimulatory factors (e.g., IFN-3,) would be produced. In addition to impairing macrophage activation, Pb has been shown to directly inhibit macrophage development (Kowolenko et al., 1989) . On the other hand, Pb can directly activate B cells (McCabe and Lawrence, 1990; Lawrence, 1981c) , and enhanced B cell: Tm cell interactions might lead to dysregulated B cell responsiveness and autoimmunity. Features of autoimmune disease induction include aberrant expression of Ia and cytokines as well as lymphoid infiltration of target tissues due to altered interactions between the lymphoid subsets (Schwartz and Rose, 1986) . Autoimmune disease incidence increases with aging. Interestingly, age-related changes in cytokine production by T helper cell subsets recently have been reported (Kubo and Cinader, 1990) . Pb involvement in immune-mediated nephritis has been suggested (Wedeen et al., 1979; Garcia et aL, 1980) ; however, data directly implicating Pb in autoimmune disease is not available. Autoimmune disease induced by mercury has been documented (Hirsch et al., 1982; Pelletier et al., 1985) . Our data suggest that Pb can promote immune dysfunctions characteristic of autoimmune disease induction. Inasmuch as little is known about the etiology of autoimmune diseases, a role for toxic agents such as Pb warrants consideration.",
