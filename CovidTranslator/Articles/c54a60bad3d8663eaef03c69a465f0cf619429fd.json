Probability of further disease spread is evaluated based on the threshold value to 3.9) using serial intervals for 424 patients in Wuhan, China 4 . Recalculation with 2033 cases based on the refined estimate from China. However, this is falling short in predicting the spread of the pandemic and expansion within individual locations, suggesting that R is not likely to be 109 constant and likely to be dynamic for each outbreak location that results in underestimates of 110 the spread rate. This limitation is hindering epidemic dynamics as previously noted due to the 111 parameter is context specific and dynamic 1,2 . Hence, there is a need to rapidly estimate country 112 specific R values during the epidemic. This will provide global comparisons of expansion at 113 each location.",

Rapidly evolving pathogens undergo genome 142 sequence mutation, selection pressure, random drift and stochastic events between infected 143 individuals 11 . Even small changes in the genome enable transmission that is determined by 144 accounting for the mutations between isolate sequences. It is recognized that the COVID-19 145 genome is changing over the outbreak but there is controversy about the impact and specifics of 146 the exact mutations. In this study, we used incidence data to derive R and compared country 147 specific COVID-19 infection dynamics with viral population genome diversity. By incorporating 148 R, epidemic curve timing, and viral genome diversity we created a systematic framework that 149 deduced how viral genome diversity can be used to describe epidemiological features of an 150 outbreak before new cases were observed. This was done by creating a genome diversity 151 metric that was directly and systematic integrated to provide context and allowed quantification 152 of the infection dynamics globally that are divergent from the early estimates with genomic 153 evidence. We call this approach pathogen genome identity (GENI) scoring system. Using GENI 154 differentiated each stage of the outbreak. It also indicated cryptic local transmission from 155 .
