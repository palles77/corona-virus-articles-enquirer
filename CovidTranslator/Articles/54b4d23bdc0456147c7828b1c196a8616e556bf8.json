Serological surveillance is the common monitoring method used in laboratory animals. A rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective high-throughput Luminex xMAP assay could be an attractive alternative to labor-intensive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. In this study, recombinant proteins from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and rabbit rotavirus and whole viral lysates of Sendai virus were used as coating antigens in an xMAP assay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against these pathogens. The xMAP assay showed high specificity, with no cross-reaction with other pathogens. The coefficient of variation for intra-assay and inter-assay comparisons was less than 3% and 4%, respectively, indicating good repeatability and stability of the assay. The xMAP assay exhibited similar limits of detection for rabbit hemorrhagic virus and Sendai virus and was less sensitive for the detection of rabbit rotavirus when compared with commercial ELISA kits. A total of 52 clinical samples were tested simultaneously using both the xMAP assay and ELISA kits. The results obtained using these two methods were 100% coincident. In summary, the novel xMAP assay offers an alternative choice for rapid and sensitive high-throughput detection of antibodies in rabbit serum and can be used as a daily monitoring tool for laboratory animals.",

The unique features of their lipoprotein metabolism and their sensitivity to cholesterol in their diet make rabbits a perfect model for human atherosclerosis [2] Transgenic rabbits expressing human CD4 and CCR5 homologs can be made highly susceptible to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and thus appropriate as models for studying disease development [3] . Rabbits are also widely used in pharmaceutical research and production of antibodies. Therefore, the quality control of rabbits is essential to guarantee the accuracy and reliability of the experiments that are performed on them.",

Seroprevalence studies and serosurveillance are essential tools for monitoring diseases as well as vaccination efficiency [4] . Currently, the main methods for antibody detection are the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA), which are time-consuming and labor-intensive [5, 6] . Both are single-analyte technologies that fail to meet the high-throughput test requirements of routine quality 1 3 monitoring [7] . Additionally, the enzyme-mediated amplification of signal during ELISA is not always linear and can thus skew the results [8] . It is therefore imperative to develop a rapid and sensitive high-throughput assay for simultaneous analysis of RHDV-, SV-and RRV-specific antibodies in a single biological sample.",

Changes in the concentrations of two or three dyes inside an individual bead can be recognized by the red classification laser based on its spectral signature, while the green reporter laser recognizes the fluorescent reporter bound to the captured analytes on the microsphere surface. Briefly, fluorescent microspheres that are pre-coated with specific diagnostic antigens that capture the corresponding antibodies are combined with fluorescent reporters, which are recognized by the Luminex reader, which can identify up to 500 targets in a single panel [10, 11] . In recent years, the Luminex bead system has found many applications in areas of fundamental and applied diagnostic studies [12] [13] [14] .",

Despite the fact that ELISA is an ultrasensitive method due to the use of enzymes and chemiluminescent substrates, it is labor-intensive, especially when dealing with a large number of samples with more than one detection target. The Luminex microsphere system was invented to meet analytical needs for rapid and sensitive high-throughput detection. By changing the staining ratio of the microspheres, hundreds of targets can be identified in a single reaction. In the last few years, there have been several reports describing the application of Luminex technology (xMAP/xTAG) in veterinary science [17] [18] [19] . However, most of the applications were for the diagnosis of pathogens in birds or laboratory animals, but not rabbits. Although a Luminex xTAG assay has been developed for detection of nucleic acids of pathogens in rabbits [20] , there is a strong demand for an xMAP assay for antibody detection in rabbits because antibody surveillance is vital to the control of diseases. In this study, a sensitive and specific xMAP assay was developed for surveillance of antibodies against RHDV, SV and RRV. Typically, the use of whole viral lysates results in a higher level of sensitivity [21] . However, the lack of a suitable cell line for RHDV and the inability to isolate RRV from clinical samples make it difficult to produce viral lysates [22] . Therefore, diagnostic antigens VP60 of RHDV and VP6 of RRV were expressed in vitro and purified for use in this study.",

With RRV, the limit of detection (LOD) was 1:25600, which was two times higher than that of ELISA (1:51200). The diagnostic antigen used in these two methods might contribute to subtle difference in the results. As discussed previously, the main advantage of using whole viral lysates is the large number of protein targets that can be detected, thus allowing a high level of sensitivity. Accordingly, the commercial ELISA kits coated with whole viral lysates showed higher sensitivity than the xMAP assay. However, high sensitivity can also increase the risk of false positive results. To avoid a false negative/positive result, samples should be rechecked to ensure the accuracy of the assay when the sample's MFI is near the cutoff value. ELISA or nucleic acid detection should be done when necessary.",
