Nevertheless, she added \"this is a single-stranded RNA virus, and that kind of virus, as it reproduces itself, doesn't have the zipper on the other side to match up perfectly, so it makes mistakes. The HIV virus is an RNA virus that does that too. And so it is not surprising that we see new strains emerge over time. We haven't documented that yet with this virus, and I think the fact that the sequenced data from the isolate characterized in Canada and the US are so close, suggests that large mutations are not occurring. But it's biologically plausible, and we'll be keeping our eye on these strains as we go forward.\"",
