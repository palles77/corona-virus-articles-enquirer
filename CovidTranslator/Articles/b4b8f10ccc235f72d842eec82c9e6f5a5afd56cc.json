No antiviral therapeutics have yet received regulatory approval or demonstrated clinical efficacy. Here we describe the discovery of a novel anti-EBOV small molecule antiviral, GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog. GS-5734 exhibits antiviral activity against multiple variants of EBOV in cell-based assays. The pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) is efficiently formed in multiple human cell types incubated with GS-5734 in vitro, and the NTP acts as an alternate substrate and RNAchain terminator in primer-extension assays utilizing a surrogate respiratory syncytial virus RNA polymerase. Intravenous administration of GS-5734 to nonhuman primates resulted in persistent Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use: http://www.nature.com",

In a rhesus monkey model of EVD, once daily intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg GS-5734 for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of EBOV replication and protected 100% of EBOV-infected animals against lethal disease, ameliorating clinical disease signs and pathophysiological markers, even when treatments were initiated three days after virus exposure when systemic viral RNA was detected in two of six treated animals. These results provide the first substantive, post-exposure protection by a smallmolecule antiviral compound against EBOV in nonhuman primates. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734 in vitro against other pathogenic RNA viruses -including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses -suggests the potential for expanded indications. GS-5734 is amenable to large-scale manufacturing, and clinical studies investigating the drug safety and pharmacokinetics are ongoing.",

The mechanism of action of Nuc requires intracellular anabolism to the active triphosphate metabolite (NTP), which is expected to interfere with the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases (RdRp). Structurally, the 1\u2032-cyano group provides potency and selectivity towards viral RNA polymerases, but because of slow first phosphorylation kinetics, modification of parent nucleosides with monophosphate promoieties have potential to greatly enhance intracellular NTP concentrations 20 . GS-5734, the single Sp isomer of the 2-ethylbutyl L-alaninate phosphosphoramidate prodrug (Supplementary Information), effectively bypasses the ratelimiting first phosphorylation step of the Nuc (Fig. 1a) . In human monocyte-derived macrophages, incubation with GS-5734 rapidly loads cells with high levels of NTP that persist with T 1/2 = 24 h following removal of GS-5734 (Extended Data Fig. 1a) , resulting in up to 30-fold higher levels compared to incubation with Nuc (Fig. 1b) . In cell-based assays, GS-5734 is active against a broad range of filoviruses including Marburg virus and several variants of EBOV (Fig. 1c) . GS-5734 inhibits EBOV replication in multiple relevant human cell types including primary macrophages and human endothelial cells with EC 50 values of 0.06 to 0.14 \u03bcM (Table 1) . As expected, the parent Nuc was less active with EC 50 values of 0.77 to >20 \u03bcM. Treatment with GS-5734 of liver Huh-7 cells infected with the EBOV-Makona variant isolated during the West African outbreak resulted in profound dosedependent reductions in viral RNA production and infectious virus yield (Extended Data Fig. 2 ). GS-5734 and the Nuc inhibited replication of other human RNA viral pathogens including respiratory syncytial virus, Junin virus, Lassa fever virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus, but was inactive against alphaviruses or retroviruses (Table 1) . Prior studies have reported activity of the Nuc against flaviviruses, parainfluenza type 3, and severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus but little or no activity against West Nile virus, influenza A, or Coxsackie A 19, 21 . The antiviral activity of GS-5734 was selective as demonstrated by low cytotoxicity in a wide range of human primary cells and cell lines (Extended Data Table 1 ).",

Consistent with the proposed mechanism of action, NTP inhibited RSV RdRp-catalyzed RNA synthesis (Fig. 1e ) by incorporating into the nascent viral RNA transcript and causing its premature termination (Fig. 1f ). In contrast, NTP did not inhibit human RNA polymerases (Fig. 1e) . These data suggest that GS-5734 selectively inhibits EBOV replication by targeting its RdRp and inhibiting viral RNA synthesis following efficient intracellular conversion to NTP. Rodent models were not suitable for GS-5734 in vivo efficacy evaluations because high serum esterase activity, present in many rodent species, degrades the GS-5734 pro-moiety and adversely impacts its pharmacokinetic profile 23 . Like humans, rhesus monkeys do not express high levels of serum esterase; rhesus lymphoid cells efficiently activated GS-5734 in vitro, although NTP levels were somewhat reduced relative to human cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b) . In rhesus monkeys, intramuscular inoculation with clinically derived wild-type EBOV produces a fulminant lethal disease with pathophysiological responses that closely resemble human EVD cases 24, 25 , and nonhuman primates (NHP) are considered the most relevant EVD models well-suited for evaluating the efficacy of antiviral interventions when trials in infected humans are not feasible.",

In brain, levels at 4 h were low relative to other tissues but remained detectable above the drug plasma levels 168 h post dose. Taken together, the pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that once-daily dosing of GS-5734 provides sustained intracellular NTP levels and efficiently delivers drug metabolites to sanctuary sites where virus may persist.",

            "text": "To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of GS-5734 we conducted a sequential two-part, adaptivedesign study in EBOV-infected rhesus monkeys (Fig. 2c) . In part 1, animals intramuscularly inoculated with EBOV were administered a 12-day regimen of vehicle (n = 3) or 3 mg/kg GS-5734 beginning on day 0 (D0; 30-90 min following virus challenge) or Day 2 (D2) (n = 6/treatment group). Regardless of the time of initiation, GS-5734 treatment conferred improved survival, 33% (2/6) in the 3 mg/kg D0 group and 66% (4/6) in the 3 mg/kg D2 group, and an antiviral effect by reducing systemic viremia relative to vehicle (Fig. 2d, Tables 2,3) ; however, mortalities observed in both treatment groups suggested that drug exposure at 3 mg/kg was sub-optimal. In part 2 of the efficacy study, GS-5734 was administered once at a loading dose of 10 mg/kg followed by once-daily 3 mg/kg doses beginning either 2 days (10/3 mg/kg D2) or 3 days (10/3 mg/kg D3) after virus exposure, or 10 mg/kg doses were administered beginning 3 days after virus exposure (10 mg/kg D3) with n = 6/group. All animals (12/12) in which GS-5734 treatments were initiated 3 days after virus exposure survived to the end of the in-life phase (Fig. 2d) . However, the antiviral effects were consistently greater in animals administered repeated 10 mg/kg GS-5734 doses ( Tables 2,3) . On Day 4, plasma viral RNA was significantly decreased (P<0.05), with geometric means reduced \u22651.7 log 10 in all GS-5734-treated groups compared with combined vehicle-treated groups ( Fig. 2e-f ; Extended Data Table 3 ), and on Days 5 and 7, when geometric mean viral RNA concentration of the vehicle group exceeded 10 9 copies/mL, viral RNA was detected at levels less than the lower limit of quantitation (8 \u00d7 10 4 RNA copies/mL) in 4 of 6 animals in the 10 mg/kg D3 group. Deep sequencing analysis of the EBOV RdRp (L) gene from all viral RNA-positive plasma samples showed no evidence of genotypic change(s) potentially associated with the emergence of GS-5734-resistant EBOV variants (Extended Data Table  5 ). The 10 mg/kg D3 GS-5734 regimen was associated with amelioration of EVD-related clinical disease signs ( Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 5 ). Although greater survival was observed in the 10/3 mg/kg D3 group than the 10/3 mg/kg D2 group, survival and viral RNA load were not statistically distinguishable (Fig. 2e ) and likely represent natural endpoint variation associated with suboptimal therapeutic effect.",

In an NHP model of clinical EVD, intravenous administration of GS-5734 results in rapid accumulation and persistence of intracellular NTP. Pronounced antiviral effects, amelioration of EVD signs, and significant survival benefit was achieved in EBOV-infected NHPs despite treatment initiation on day 3, a time when systemic viral RNA was detectable. These results represent the first case of substantive postexposure protection against EVD by a small-molecule antiviral compound in NHPs. Intravenous GS-5734 is currently being evaluated in multiple dose studies in healthy human volunteers to assess clinical safety and pharmacokinetics, and to help determine whether GS-5734 may provide therapeutic benefit in acute or recrudescent cases of EVD, or in survivors with prolonged virus shedding and/or chronic clinical sequelae. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734 and its amenability to large-scale production warrants further assessment of its therapeutic potential against other significant human viral pathogens for which no treatment is available.",

A \"no virus\" control and a \"1% DMSO\" control were included to determine the 0% and 100% virus infection, respectively. The primary and secondary antibodies and dyes used for nuclear and cytoplasmic staining are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . The primary antibody specific for a particular viral protein was diluted 1,000-fold in blocking buffer (1\u00d7 PBS with 3% BSA) and added to each well of the assay plate. The assay plates were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. The primary antibody was removed, and the cells were washed 3 times with 1\u00d7 PBS. The secondary detection antibody was an antimouse (or rabbit) IgG conjugated with Dylight488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat. No. 405310). The secondary antibody was diluted 1,000-fold in blocking buffer and was added to each well in the assay plate. Assay plates were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using Draq5 (Biostatus, Shepshed Leicestershire, UK) or 33342 Hoechst (ThermoFisher Scientific) for Vero and HFF-1 cell lines. Both dyes were diluted in 1\u00d7 PBS. The cytoplasm of HFF-1 (EBOV assay) and Vero E6 (MERS assay) cells were counter-stained with CellMask \u2122 Deep Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cell images were acquired using a Perkin Elmer Opera confocal plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) using 10\u00d7 air objective to collect five images per well. Virus-specific antigen was quantified by measuring fluorescence emission at a 488 nm wavelength and the stained nuclei were quantified by measuring fluorescence emission at a 640 nm wavelength. Acquired images were analyzed using Harmony and Acapella PE software. The Draq5 signal was used to generate a nuclei mask to define each nuclei in the image for quantification of cell number. The CellMask Deep Red dye was used to demarcate the Vero and HFF-1 cell borders for cell-number quantitation. The viral-antigen signal was compartmentalized within the cell mask. Cells that exhibited antigen signal higher than the selected threshold were counted as positive for viral infection. The ratio of virus positive cells to total number of analyzed cells was used to determine the percent infection for each well on the assay plates. Effect of compounds on the viral infection was assessed as percent inhibition of infection in comparison to control wells. The resultant cell number and percent infection were normalized for each assay plate. The Z\u2032 values for all antiviral assays were >0.3. Analysis of dose response curve was performed using GeneData Screener software applying Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) for curve fitting strategy. The curve-fitting process, including individual data point exclusion were pre-specified by default software settings. R 2 -value quantified goodness of fit and fitting strategy was considered acceptable at R 2 > 0.8.",

Acceptance criteria for positive template control (PTC), negative template control (NTC), negative extraction control (NEC), and positive extraction control (PEC) are SOP-specified. For qualitative assessments, the limit of detection (LOD) was defined as Ct 38.07, based on method validation testing. An animal was considered to have tested positive for detection of EBOV RNA when a minimum of 2 of 3 replicates were designated as \"positive\" and PTC, NTC, and NEC controls meet specified method-acceptance criteria. A sample was designated as \"positive\" when the Ct value was <LOD Ct.",

Challenge virus was propagated from the clinical specimen using cultured cells (Vero or Vero E6) for a total of four passages. Animals (3-6 years) were randomly assigned to experimental treatment groups, stratified by sex (with equal number of males and females per group) and balanced by body weight, using SAS \u00ae statistical software (Cary, North Carolina, USA). Study personnel responsible for assessing animal health (including euthanasia assessment) and administering treatments were experimentally blinded to group assignment of animals.

Protocols were reviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Covance. Efficacy experiments involving EBOV were performed in ABSL-4 at USAMRIID. Research was conducted under an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocol in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, PHS Policy, and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals. The facilities where this research was conducted are accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International and strictly adhere to principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 2011 (National Academies Press, Washington, DC.).StatisticsCombined vehicle group from Part 1 and 2 (N = 6 animals total) was used as control group in all statistical comparisons. The impact of GS-5734 treatment on the survival rates was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed by log-rank analysis using Dunnett-Hsu procedure to adjust for multiple comparisons. The effect on systemic viral RNA levels was assessed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing each GS-5734 treatment group with vehicle group using Dunnett's test to adjust for multiple comparisons. Wilcoxon ranksum test without adjustment for multiple comparisons was used to compare the effects of GS-5734 treatment on hematology, coagulation and clinical chemistry parameters. All data met the statistical assumptions of the test performed.Extended DataExtended DataFigure 1.a, Intracellular metabolite profile in human macrophages. Following a 2-h pulse incubation (black bar at top of y-axis) of human monocyte-derived macrophages with 1 \u03bcM GS-5734 (mean \u00b1 s.d, from three donors.). GS-5734 is rapidly metabolized and not detected in cells. Transient exposure to the intermediate metabolite Ala-Met is observed followed by persistent Nuc and nucleotide analog exposure. The pharmacologically active NTP is formed quickly achieving a C max at 4 h and persisted with a half-life of 16 \u00b1 1 h in the three donors. Intracellular concentration estimated based on an intracellular volume of 1 pL/cell. b, Efficiency of GS-5734 activation in human and rhesus cells in vitro. Intracellular NTP concentrations formed in human and rhesus PBMC, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages during a 2-h incubation with 1 \u03bcM GS-5734 (results are the mean \u00b1 SD of two (PBMC and monocyte) to six (macrophage) independent experiments done in cells from different donors). Intracellular concentrations estimated based on a cell volume of 0.2 pL/ cell for PBMC and monocytes and 1 pL/cell for macrophage. c, Intracellular NTP levels required for inhibition of EBOV replication in cell culture. The diastereomeric mixture at phosphorous containing GS-5734 was incubated continuously for 72 h at 1 \u03bcM and levels of intracellular NTP were determined (results are the average of duplicate incubations done in each cell type; two independent studies were done in HMVEC isolated from different donors)",
