AES is an enzyme-inhibiting aptamer bearing a target-molecule binding site which can allosterically control enzymatic activity. The thrombin-inhibiting aptamer bearing a G-quartet structure was chosen as the enzyme-inhibiting aptamer. The stem-and-loop structure, which contains a strand complementary to the target DNA, was inserted into the G-quartet structure of the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer to disrupt the G-quartet structure through the hybridization of the target DNA with the complementary strand in the AES. The disruption of the G-quartet structure led to a decrease of the inhibitory activity of the whole aptameric complex. Using this designed aptamer, we were able to detect target DNAs by measuring the thrombin activity in a homogeneous solution without bound/free separation, and the lower detection limit was 20 nM.",

Most DNA sensing systems are based on the detection of the hybridization of the target DNA with the immobilized probe DNA (DNA chip); however, it takes time to detect the target DNA using this method, since the separation of the hybridized DNA molecules from the non-hybridized ones is usually required. Especially for the diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria or viruses, a rapid DNA sensing system is necessary.",

            "text": "To detect target DNAs quickly and easily, a homogeneous detection system which does not require the bound/ free separation is ideal. A homogeneous detection system which uses a molecular recognition element that generates a detection signal when binding to the target molecule is required. Recently, such functional molecular recognition elements have been reported for DNA sensing; for example, molecular beacons [1] , double-stranded probes [2] , excimer fluorescence [3, 4] , fluorescent polymers [5] , DNAzymes [6, 7] , DNA-fused nanoparticles [8] , and inhibitor-DNAenzyme modules [9, 10] have been developed. These novel sensor systems mainly rely on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to generate a detection signal. FRET is useful for biosensors. However, enzyme detection of the hybridization between the probe DNA and the target DNA can improve sensitivity, since the enzyme can amplify the signal. At present, there are DNA sensor systems which use enzymes bound to the probe DNA and their inhibitors that can detect the target DNA by measuring the enzymatic activity in a homogeneous solution [9, 10] . However, the chemical modification of the enzyme using the DNA probe is sometimes difficult; if we can develop a DNA probe which induces a change in the enzymatic activity, which can then be used as a detection signal upon hybridization with the target DNA, it would make the DNA sensing system simpler and easier to integrate into a wide range of applications. With the aim of constructing such a DNA probe, we focused on aptamers.",

Some aptamers with high enzyme-binding activity also show high inhibitory activity and can therefore be used as pharmaceuticals [15] . DNA aptamers are easily and inexpensively synthesized; therefore, it is easy to add a probe DNA to a DNA aptamer. Additionally, DNA aptamers have a distinctive advantage, in that they are singlestranded DNAs, and therefore the way their structure changes is easy to design. Signal-generating molecules [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , which acquire their properties as a result of such changes, work like molecular beacons. Molecular beacons generate signals, usually fluorescence emission, as a result of the structural changes caused by the hybridization with the target DNA.",

We designed the stem-and-loop structure inserted into the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer in such a way that the conformational change in stem-andloop structure would lead to a conformational change in the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, which would in turn cause a decrease in the inhibitory effect of the whole complex on thrombin.",

The diameter of a DNA double helix (approximately 20 \u00c5 ) is longer than the distance between two Gs of the G-quartet structure (approximately 17 \u00c5 ). Therefore, we expected that the difference would cause the distortion and destabilization of the G-quartet structure if the stem-and-loop structure were to be directly connected to the G-quartet structure.

Therefore, we speculated that the AESs will have a G-quartet structure and that it would be destroyed upon hybridization with the target DNAs, judging from the fact that the inhibitory activity of the AESs decreased upon hybridization with their respective target DNAs. In order to investigate whether this structural change occurs or not, we measured the CD spectra of AES SARS 1 in the presence or absence of its target DNA and analyzed them using DMS footprinting assay.",

When comparing the CD spectrum produced by subtracting the spectrum of the stem-and-loop DNA sequence from that of AES SARS 1 with that of the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, we can see that the peaks near 265 and 250 nm shifted to 273 and 253 nm, respectively, and that the positive peak at 295 nm was weak. The anti-parallel G-quartet structure had a positive peak near 295 and 250 nm, and a negative peak at 265 nm, and these peaks disappeared due to the destabilization of the G-quartet structure [36] . This suggests that AES SARS 1 folds into a G-quartet structure, but that the G-quartet structure of AES SARS 1 is unstable compared with the structure of the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer. This hypothesis is supported by the results for AES SARS 1, which showed lower thrombin-inhibiting activity than the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, since the stability of the G-quartet structure of the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer relates to the thrombin-inhibiting activity.",

Although the N 7 of guanine is methylated by dimethyl sulfate (DMS), an oligonucleotide folded into a G-quartet structure is protected from N 7 methylation since the N 7 of one guanine forms a hydrogen bond with the N 2 of another guanine to form the G-quartet structure. The DMS foot- printing assay was performed on FITC-labeled AES SARS 1, FITC-labeled AES SARS 1 hybridized with its target DNA, and FITC-labeled 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer containing potassium ions or not. In the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, the potassium ions are necessary for G-quartet structure folding. Therefore, as shown Fig. 6 , the guanine residues composing the G-quartet structure (G9, G10, G13, G14, G18, G19, G22, and G23) were exposed to N 7 methylation in the absence of potassium ions (lanes 1 and 2) . In AES SARS 1, although G49 and G50 (residues corresponding to G22 and G23 in the 31mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, respectively) were not detected, G9, G10, G13, G14, G18, and G19 (residues corresponding to G9, G10, G13, G14, G18, and G19 in the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, respectively) were protected from N 7 methylation (lanes 3 and 5). The N 7 methylation of the guanine residues of AES SARS 1 did not change the residues in the presence of the 15-mer control DNA; however, they were not protected from N 7 methylation in the presence of the target DNA (lane 6). These results indicate that AES SARS 1 has a G-quartet structure and that it is destroyed during hybridization with the target DNA.",

In this study, we constructed a new AES whose function changes upon hybridization with the target DNA. This DNA detection system is very simple compared to other reported DNA sensing systems, because it is simply an unmodified oligonucleotide; the only preparatory procedure is the insertion of a stemand-loop structure into the aptamer, and so the system can be applied to any aptamer. We had already developed different types of AESs by connecting a thrombininhibiting aptamer to target-molecule-binding aptamers, one of which was used for adenosine detection [24] . With those AES systems, target molecules can be detected by measuring the thrombin activity. Therefore, we believe that it is possible to detect many target DNAs, RNAs, low-mass molecules, and proteins in a common assay using AESs.",
