This review focuses on the recent cellular, biochemical, and structural discoveries that have provided new insight as to how IFIT1 functions as both a sensor and effector molecule of the cellular innate immune system. IFIT1 can detect viral RNA lacking 2'-O methylation on their cap structures or displaying a 5'triphosphate moiety and inhibit their translation or sequester them from active replication. Because of these inhibitory actions, many viruses have evolved unique mechanisms to evade IFIT1 to facilitate replication, spread of infection, and disease pathogenesis.",

Viral PAMPs are detected by specific host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9), RIG-I-like receptors (MDA5 and RIG-I) and DNA sensors (cGAS, DAI, IFI16, DHX9, and DHX36) in the endosome and within the cytoplasm (1-3). Binding of viral PAMPs to PRRs triggers signaling pathways that induce the expression of virus-responsive genes and antiviral cytokines (e.g., type I interferon (IFN)), which limit virus replication and shape adaptive immunity.",

Signal transduction following the binding of type I IFN to IFNAR occurs via Janus kinase (JAK) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and results in translocation of the transcription factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3, which is comprised of IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) and phoshorylated STAT1 and STAT2) into the nucleus, which induces the transcription of hundreds (6-9) of different IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs encode distinct proteins with diverse biological functions that block multiple stages of the viral lifecycle including entry, translation, replication, assembly and spread. Additionally, some ISGs have immunomodulatory activity including effects on leukocyte recruitment and priming of adaptive immunity.",

            "text": "IFIT1 is a member of a family of related genes that arose by gene duplication and are induced after type I IFN treatment or viral infection (16) . Four IFIT family members have been characterized extensively in humans (IFIT1 (also known as ISG56), IFIT2 (ISG54), IFIT3 (ISG60) and IFIT5 (ISG58)) and are localized to chromosome 10q23. Three members are expressed in mice: Ifit1 (Isg56), Ifit2 (Isg54), Ifit3 (Isg49) and are located on chromosome 19qC1. Additional less characterized yet highly related IFIT genes (IFIT1B (human) and Ifit1b, Ifit1c and Ifit3b (mouse)) in syntenic regions of the chromosome exist, although their functional significance remain undefined. A non-transcribed IFIT1-related pseudogene is present on human chromosome 13 (17) . IFIT genes share a similar genomic structure with most composed of two exons, with the second exon containing the vast majority of the coding sequence. IFIT1 gene homologs exist in other mammalian species as well as birds, fish and amphibians (reviewed in (18)). IFIT1 proteins localize within the cytoplasm and lack any enzymatic domains or activity. They contain multiple tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR); this motif is composed of 34 amino acids that adopt a helix-turn-helix structure and mediate protein-protein interactions. Proteins containing TPR motifs regulate the cell cycle, transcription, protein transport, and protein folding (19) . Different IFIT family members have distinct numbers and arrangements of TPR motifs (Fig 2B) , which likely dictate unique functions; for example, IFIT1 has six and IFIT2 has four. Human and mouse IFIT1 share a sequence identity of 53% at the amino acid level, and have varied relatedness (~38 to 57%) to other IFIT homologs within a given species. Although the sequence similarity between the different IFIT proteins within a species is high (18) , their distinct effects on replication of individual viruses suggest they serve non-redundant functions in the host response to viral infections (20-22).",

IFIT genes were described as viral stress-inducible genes (23) and are induced at the transcriptional level directly by IRF3 (34, 35) , which is activated soon after viral infection (via a MAVS or STING-dependent signal), often prior to the induction of type I IFN.

In the 2.8 \u00c5 highresolution IFIT2 structure, monomers of IFIT2 had nine TPR motifs and formed domainswapped homodimers. IFIT2 had an extensively positively charged C-terminal region that supported RNA binding with or without 5\u2032 triphosphorylation (5\u2032-ppp) (40) . Mutation or deletion of charged residues in this region that altered RNA binding to IFIT2 negatively affected antiviral activity against Newcastle disease and Sendai viruses when these IFIT2 variants were expressed ectopically in 293T cells (40) . This study also suggested that IFIT2 binds to RNA containing adenylate uridylate (AU)-rich elements. These are found in mRNA of some genes that encode cytokines or apoptotic factors and their targeting could contribute to how IFIT2 regulates inflammatory responses (44, 45) .",

In IFIT5, 18 of its 24 \u03b1-helices form canonical TPRs with the remaining helices intervening between TPRs. This results in the formation of three distinct bundles of TPRs oriented in a V-like structure to give the overall protein a clampshaped structure (Fig 1) . Structural analysis also revealed a helical domain containing a positively charged cavity that engaged a single-stranded 5\u2032-ppp RNA. Binding of 5\u2032-ppp RNA to IFIT1 and IFIT5 occurs in a non-sequence specific manner and requires an overhang of five and three 5' nucleotides, respectively. Mutation of residues that altered 5\u2032ppp RNA binding to IFIT5 reduced antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis (VSV) or influenza (IAV) viruses when variant IFIT5 proteins were expressed ectopically in 293T cells.",

Analogous to studies with IFIT2, IFIT5 co-purification of cellular RNA or binding to tRNA was reduced by C-terminal truncation and mutation of positively charged residues in the cleft also diminished RNA binding activity (42). Feng et al described electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments in which IFIT5 bound with high-affinity (10-100 nM) to poly A, poly U, and poly C single-stranded RNA and ATrich double-stranded DNA (43) . C-terminal truncations and site-specific mutations of positively charged residues abolished the poly A single-stranded RNA and AT-rich doublestranded DNA binding activity of IFIT5.

Whereas N-7 methylation is essential for RNA translation and stability, until recently, the function of 2\u2032-O methylation was uncertain (46, 47) . My group showed that a West Nile virus (WNV) mutant in the viral NS5 gene (WNV-NS5-E218A) lacking 2'-O methyltransferase activity (48) was attenuated in wild type cells and mice but was pathogenic in the absence of Ifit1 expression (30, 49) . The mutant virus lacking 2'-O methyltransferase activity showed increased replication in peripheral and central nervous system tissues of Ifit1 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared with wild type mice. 2'-O methylation of viral RNA did not affect IFN\u03b2 induction in WNVinfected cells but instead modulated the antiviral activity of IFIT genes including IFIT1. This finding has been confirmed with several related flaviviruses. Two groups made identical or analogous mutations in the NS5 gene (NS5-E218A or NS5-K61A) of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), which resulted in abrogation of 2'-O methylation, attenuation in wild type mice, and enhanced sensitivity and restriction by type I IFN and IFIT1 (50, 51) . Another report describes similar mutations in Dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) and serotype (DENV-2) in which substitutions were engineered (NS5-E216A (DENV-1) and NS5-E217A and NS5-K61A (DENV-2)) that abrogate 2'-O methyltransferase activity (52) . DENV strains lacking 2'-O methylation were attenuated in mice and macaques and more sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFIT1. As both the mutant JEV and DENV retained immunogenicity in animal models, 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutant flaviviruses have been proposed as novel live-attenuated vaccines that are self-limited due to the enhanced restriction by IFIT1 and the host innate immune response.",

IFN-\u03b1 treatment preferentially inhibited infection of a human coronavirus (strain 229E) 2'-O methyltransferase mutant (nsp16 D129A) in HeLa cells, and this restriction was linked to IFIT1 expression (54) .

The preferential binding of IFIT1 to cap 0 RNA was corroborated by RNA immunoprecipitation experiments (51) . A separate group ectopically expressed IFIT proteins and performed affinity purifications using capped RNA. Among the IFIT family members only human and murine IFIT1 were detected when capped RNA was used as bait (54) . Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, this group showed that IFIT1 bound efficiently to cap 0 RNA but poorly to cap 1 RNA (54) . Primer extension assays showed that recombinant human and rabbit IFIT1 and IFIT1B bind cap-proximal regions of cap 0 mRNAs with high affinity (K 1/2,app ~9 to 23 nM). Methylation at the 2\u2032-O position abrogated IFIT1-mRNA interaction, whereas IFIT1B retained the ability to bind cap 1 mRNA with reduced affinity (K 1/2,app ~450 nM) (57) . These data suggest that IFIT1 can sense the methylation state of capped RNA.",

Kimura labeling in cell culture to assess the impact of IFIT1 on global translation. Ifit1 +/+ and Ifit1 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages were infected with either MHV-WT or MHV-nsp16-D130A and analyzed by whole-proteome shotgun mass spectrometry. Translation of viral proteins was reduced selectively in Ifit1 +/+ cells infected with MHV-nsp16-D130A (54). Kumar et al investigated the influence of IFIT1 on translation initiation using an in vitro reconstituted translation system and a toe-printing assay. 48S ribosomal complexes were assembled from individual purified 40S subunits, Met-tRNA, eIF2, eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A, eIF4A, eIF4B and eIF4F on cap 0 and cap 1 mRNA in the presence and absence of different IFIT proteins. At 800 nM, IFIT1 nearly abrogated 48S complex formation on cap 0 mRNA, whereas IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5 did not affect 48S complex formation. Titration experiments showed that 48S complex formation on cap 0 mRNA was sensitive even to low (~50 nM) concentrations of IFIT1 (57) . Collectively, these data indicate that synthesis of proteins encoded by viral RNA lacking 2\u2032-O methylation is inhibited by IFIT1.",

As translation of cellular mRNA requires binding of the cap-binding protein eIF4E (58), initial experiments tested whether IFIT1 could compete with eIF4E for binding to cap 0 mRNA as a means of selectively inhibiting translation. Cap 0 and cap 1 mRNA were coupled to beads and assayed for binding to recombinant eIF4E in the presence or absence of recombinant IFIT1. eIF4E interaction with bead-bound cap 0 but not cap 1 RNA was reduced by IFIT1, suggesting that the two proteins compete for the RNA target (54) . A subsequent study confirmed these results as IFIT1 binding to cap 0 mRNA was unaffected by a 10-fold excess of eIF4E or eIF4F (57) . Thus, the affinity of IFIT1 for cap 0 RNA enables it to outcompete eIF4E and eIF4F for binding and selectively prevents translation initiation (Fig 2) .",

This includes DNA (poxviruses), positive-sense (flaviviruses and coronaviruses), negative-sense (rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses) and double-stranded (reovirus) RNA viruses. The capping of viral mRNA can be classified as 'conventional', when it follows the enzymatic steps of the mRNA-capping pathways used by host or 'non-conventional', when it does not (reviewed in (67, 68) ). Poxviruses (e.g., vaccinia virus) encode a 'conventional' capping system, which contains a multifunctional mRNA cap-synthesizing enzyme (D1 gene) that includes an RNA triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and N-7 methyltransferase. After the N-7 methylguanosine type 0 cap is added, the cap 1 structure is completed by the activity of a separate viral protein (VP39 encoded by J3 gene) that adds a 2\u2032-O-methyl group. The cap formation of flavivirus RNA also follows the conventional pathway of mRNA cap formation through sequential activities of the viral RNA triphosphatase (NS3 gene), guanylyltransferase (NS5 gene) and N-7 and 2\u2032-O methyltransferases (NS5 gene). Coronaviruses also are believed to produce mRNAs with a cap 1 structure through the \"conventional\" capping pathway although all of the component enzymes have not been defined. The viral Nsp14 and nsp16 genes encode the N-7 and 2\u2032-O coronavirus methyltransferases, respectively. Some virus families (e.g., Rhabdoviridae) form RNA cap structures through a 'nonconventional' mechanism that is distinct from the cellular mRNA capping pathway. During the mRNA cap formation of VSV, an unknown NTPase hydolyzes GTP to GDP. Monophosphorylated viral mRNA is transferred to GDP by a polyribonucleotidyltransferase, which then generates the Gpp-pA-RNA cap structure. This RNA cap is methylated sequentially by the L protein of VSV first at the ribose-2\u2032-O position and then at the guanine-N-7 position, resulting in m7GpppAm-RNA cap 1 structure (69).",

This 'cap snatching' mechanism was first identified in influenza virus (70, 71) and is performed by two of its polymerase subunits (PB2 and PA). PB2 binds to the 5\u2032 end of capped cellular mRNA and then the endonuclease activity of PA cleaves the cellular RNA 10 to 13 nucleotides downstream of the cap structure. The released short, capped mRNAs that are released are then used as primers by the viral polymerase to synthesize nascent viral mRNA (72) . The sequence, length and structure of the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA that comes with the cap varies among virus families. Most sequences are 15 to 20 nucleotides long but arenaviruses may use shorter primers (73).",

Hepaciviruses and pestiviruses of the Flaviviridae family of RNA viruses lack a cap structure at their 5' end but encode for an IRES to initiate viral translation in a cap-independent manner. The HCV IRES directly recruits the 40S ribosome subunit to the translation initiator codon of the genome and does not require interactions with eukaryotic initiation factors eIF1, 1A, 4A, 4B and 4E (74) . Thus, in theory, HCV could still be translated even if IFIT1 were bound to the 5' end of the genomic RNA. However, IFIT1 may block HCV translation through an independent mechanism by targeting eIF3-dependent steps in the viral RNA translation initiation process (see 1.3.3) . Although other RNA viruses (e.g., picornaviruses) encode IRES elements, there are differences in function and requirements for eukaryotic translation initiation factors (reviewed in (75)). Indeed, in contrast to HCV, the IRES-containing encephalomyocarditis virus (a picornavirus) is resistant to the antiviral effects of IFIT1 (32, 49) .",

For viruses of the Picornaviridae family, the VPg 'cap' does not function in translation but instead serves as a primer to synthesize RNA by the viral polymerase and protects RNA from exonuclease degradation.

Alphaviruses have a defined cap 0 structure lacking 2'-O methylation on the 5' end of their viral genomic and subgenomic RNA (80, 81) , which is synthesized through a non-conventional mechanism (67) . A recent study shows that alphaviruses use a stable stem-loop structure in their 5'-untranslated region (UTR) to antagonize IFIT1 binding and antiviral activity (56) . Mutations within the 5'-UTR that affect stable RNA structural elements enabled restriction by or antagonism of Ifit1 in vitro and in vivo. This phenomenon explains why some alphavirus strains are more sensitive to the antiviral effects of type I IFN (82) , and links the phenotype to single nucleotide changes in the 5'-UTR of the alphavirus RNA (83) . Thus, structural elements at the 5' end of alphavirus genome can function to evade IFIT1-dependent restriction of non-2'-O methylated viral RNA.",

            "text": "Triggering an effective intrinsic cellular antiviral response is essential for the host to eliminate invading pathogens. To promote their own survival, viruses have developed strategies to escape host recognition by interfering with antiviral detection pathways, signaling cascades, and effector mechanisms. IFIT1 is an IFN-induced highly expressed protein that functions in the cytoplasm as a dual sensor and effector molecule to restrict virus infection. IFIT1 preferentially recognizes non-2'-O methylated or uncapped non-self viral mRNA and suppresses translation initiation or sequesters the RNA from active replication. IFIT1 likely contributes to a species barrier that puts evolutionary pressure on viruses to generate mRNA with host cap structures. 'Successful' or pathogenic viruses have evolved mechanisms to produce mRNA with 5\u2032-ends that mimic host cellular mRNAs, including viral RNA with N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation through several independent strategies (encoding capping machinery, 'cap-snatching', or using host capping machinery). Viruses also can avoid or attenuate IFIT1 restriction by using cap-independent translation mechanisms, covalent binding of viral proteins to the 5\u2032-end of the RNA, or evolving secondary structures at their 5\u2032-end that inhibit IFIT1 binding and function. As both host and many viral mRNA share 2'-O methylation, higher eukaryotic cells may be trapped into retaining this modification, despite its relative lack of protective effect against viral pathogens (84) . A deeper mechanistic understanding of IFIT1 biology could facilitate the development of novel antiviral agents that target viral methyltransferases or other proteins to re-sensitize pathogenic viruses to the inhibitory activities of IFIT1.

(Left) Viral mRNA with cap 1 structures (N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation) recruits eIF4E and initiates translation and polyribosome formation. IFIT1 binds poorly to cap 1 mRNA. (Right) Viral mRNA with cap 0 structures lacking 2\u2032-O methylation are recognized by preferentially by IFIT1, which prevents binding of eIF4E and efficient translation. This Figure was adapted from published models(54,85).",

            "text": "Mechanisms of evasion of IFIT1 by virusesDifferent families of RNA and RNA viruses use distinct mechanisms to evade IFIT1dependent restriction. These include: (i) viral-encoded N-7 and 2'-O methyltranferases (MTase) to generate a cap 1 structure on their mRNA (flavivirus, coronavirus, rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, reovirus, and poxvirus), which prevents IFIT1 binding; (ii) use of hostencoded N-7 and 2'-O methyltranferases (MTase) in the nucleus to generate a cap 1 structure on their mRNA (herpesvirus, retrovirus, bornavirus, parvovirus, polyomavirus, and papilomavirus); (iii) 'cap-snatching' mechanisms to cleave cap 1 structures from host mRNA (10 to 20 nucleotides). The capped leader RNA is used to prime transcription on the viral genome, which leads to the synthesis of capped, translatable viral mRNAs (orthomyxovirus, arenavirus, and bunyavirus); (iv) RNA structural elements at the 5'-end of type 0 capped alphavirus RNA antagonize IFIT1 binding and function; and (v) some positive sense RNA viruses utilize IRES elements to mediate cap-independent translation. For hepaciviruses and pestiviruses the 5'-end remains as an uncapped 5'-ppp RNA. Picornaviruses and caliciviruses covalently attach a viral protein (VPg) to the 5'-end.
