Under radiotherapy, cell can trigger internal self-defense mechanisms in fighting against genome stresses induced by acute ion radiation (IR). To simulate the investigating of cellular responding acute IR at single cell level further, we propose a model of P53 gene regulatory networks under radiotherapy. Our model can successfully implement the kinetics of double strand breaks (DSBs) generating and their repair, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation, as well as P53-MDM2 feedback regulating. By comparing simulations under different IR dose, we can try to find the optimal strategy in controlling of IR dose and therapy time, and provide some theoretical analysis to obtain much better outcome of radiotherapy further.",

Under continuous effect of acute IR, DSBs occur within the cell, and trigger the binding of the sensor protein kinase ATM to the nascent DNA ends, consequently increase the kinase activity of ATM (Li et al., 2001) . As an important transcription factor within nuclear, P53 can be activated by DNA damage transferring through ATM activation. By regulating downstream genes and their signal pathways, active P53 further induce cell cycle arrest to repair DNA * Corresponding author.",

Followed the transferring of DSBCs signal from damage sites, ATM is activated rapidly with the cooperation of DSBCs and positive self-feedback of active ATM (ATM # ). The module of P53-MDM2 feedback loop is the kernel part of P53 gene regulatory networks, which is sensitive to DNA damage transferring through ATM activation. P53 is activated rapidly followed the increase of ATM # within the cell (Bar-Or et al., 2000; Banin et al., 1998) and subsequently regulate its downstream genes and signal pathways to induce cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis, controlling the process of DNA damage repair, and abnormal cells apoptosis (Weller, 1998; Ritter et al., 2002) . The implementation of the three modules is described in the following paragraphs in detail.",

Although DSBCs signal will subside whether the DSB was correctly repaired or not (Ma et al., 2005) , the misrepair of DSBs have profound consequence for the subsequent viability of the cell, especially affect the outcome of radiotherapy (Dewey et al., 1995; Magn\u00e9 et al., 2006) . Therefore, we obviously distinguish between correct repair part (F r ) and misrepair part (F w ) of DSBs, and further deal F w as a part of toxins remaining within the cell, which can be eliminated indirectly by the regulatory mechanisms of P53 gene regulatory networks during and after radiotherapy (Ritter et al., 2002; Pauklin et al., 2005) .",

Based on above rules and the existing parameters used in the previous models (Qi et al., in press-a, in press-b; Ma et al., 2005; Bar-Or et al., 2000) , we obtained the kinetics of cellular responding radiotherapy through simulation platform in MATLAB7.0.

It means that 35 kx DSBs are generated on average within a single cell, x is IR dose, and k is a changeable parameter according to different time scale. The total resulting DSBs (DT) are split into the simple breaks (D 1 ) in the fast repair process and complex ones (D 2 ) in the slow repair process (Lan, Ma et al., 2005) .

Due to the adequate repair proteins available around damage sites and the irreversible step of the final repair process, DSBCs increase dramatically against radiotherapy time.

Upon the activation by ATM # and decreased degradation by MDM2, the total amount of P53 proteins increases quickly. Due to the P53-dependent induction of MDM2 transcription, the increase of MDM2 proteins is sufficiently large to lower the P53 level, which in turn reduces the amount of the MDM2 proteins. The oscillation pulses shown in Fig. 7a have a period of 400 min, and the phase difference between P53 and MDM2 is about 100 min. Moreover, the first pulse is slightly higher than the second, quite similar with the experimental observations (Lahav et al., 2004) and the simulation results (Ma et al., 2005) . Meantime, based on the assumption in this module that toxins including F w can be eliminated by the regulation effect of P53 # directly, we plot the different kinetics of F w elimination with and without the regulatory functions of P53 # . As shown in Fig. 7b , with the eliminating effect of P53 # the toxins keep low level with some oscillations against the toxins increasing dramatically without P53 # .",

By using a set of differential equations, combined with the Poisson random function, the stochastic kinetics of DSBs generating was implemented under constant effect of acute IR dose. Meanwhile, we assume that there are adequate repair proteins available around damage sites. Therefore, the increasing DSBC signal trigger the switch-like ATM activation, and further prompt the regulatory functions of P53 gene networks in response to genome stresses. In addition, we deal that F w is a part of toxins accumulated within the cell during radiotherapy, and further assume that the toxins can be eliminated directly by the regulatory functions of P53 gene regulatory networks.",
