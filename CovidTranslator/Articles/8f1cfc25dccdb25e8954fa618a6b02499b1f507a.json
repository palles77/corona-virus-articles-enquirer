Previous studies have introduced many experiments showing the germicidal effect of UR-UVGI systems. In this study, a novel numerical method of estimating the germicidal effect of UR-UVGI systems for air exhaled by ward patients was introduced. The method adopts and modifies the concept of ventilation efficiency because the germicidal effect depends upon how the air containing airborne infectious particles flows and stays within UV-radiated area. A case study based on a four-patient ward showed that UV doses were correlated with the age of the air exhaled by a source patient, as expected. Moreover, the UV doses were considerably affected by the position of the UR-UVGI system. Inactivation rates of the influenza virus estimated using the UV doses, were in the range of 48e74%, and those of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were 68e90% in the breathing area of a neighboring patient. The results indicate not directly the decreased concentration of airborne infectious particles, but the possibility of inactivation caused by the UR-UVGI system, which is useful for system optimization.",

As one of the countermeasures against these threat, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems have attracted attention. The use of UV radiation for germicidal purposes has a long history, but its practical application was only considered after the identification of UV radiation emission from discharge lamps in the early 20th century [1] . A number of infectious microorganisms and viruses that have been prevalent at the time, such as influenza and tuberculosis, were shown to be effectively inactivated by UV radiation [2, 3] . For example, Wells had performed several initial experiments showing the germicidal effect of UV radiation in combating airborne infectious microorganisms as done by other researchers [4] [5] . His book, published in 1954, was one of the first comprehensive sources that described the characteristics of airborne infectious diseases and the effective usage of UV radiation [6] .",

On the other hand, a UR-UVGI system installed in a room begins to inactivate infectious airborne microorganisms, as soon as they are emitted from one or more sources and exposed to UV rays in the room, due to proximity. This inactivation can prevent the dispersion of airborne microorganisms not only in the room but also to other rooms. The position of the UR-UVGI systems is restricted to locations safe for occupants, such as the upper part of the room, and several horizontal louvers are usually placed in front of UVC lamps to ensure horizontal UVC rays only radiate the upper part of the room, because UVGI systems use the ultraviolet C-band (UVC) with wavelengths in the range 200e280 nm. This wavelength range has a germicidal effect on a wide range of microorganisms, but is also known to possibly cause skin redness and eye irritation when overexposed to humans [8] . Therefore, it is important to identify factors such as the airflow transferring air from the lower space to the upper space and the distribution of UVC intensity from the UR-UVGI system. Experimental methods using less harmful microorganisms in fullscale chambers have been employed to evaluate the germicidal efficacy of UR-UVGI [9e11], but it is costly and slow to evaluate and design UR-UVGI systems using experimental methods at the design stage. Therefore, numerical methods have been applied by several studies [12, 13] .",

The overall ventilation efficiency has customarily been measured using a trace gas method. Sandberg introduced the concept of the age of air, the mean time elapsed before fresh air introduced into a room reaches a specific point to evaluate local ventilation efficiency [15] . However, measuring the age of air is very tedious work, even in an small enclosed room. Therefore, Kato et al. [16] introduced a numerical simulation method to estimate the local age of air in a room with steady state flow and diffusion fields. The scale of ventilation efficiency 3 (SVE3) corresponding to the local age of air, among several terms introduced by Kato, defines the mean traveling time required by the air mass from a supply opening to reach a specific point in a room. The SVE3 can be calculated using the contaminant concentration at a point under conditions of uniform contaminant generation throughout a room and fresh air intake from supply openings. Because the SVE3 is normalized by the nominal ventilation time, the SVE3 of ventilation systems with different air exchange rates can be compared with each other.",

Their relationship has been expressed in terms of an exponential decay equation [19] . where, SR is the survival rate and k is the UV rate constant [m 2 /J] that indicates the UV susceptibility of each microorganism or virus. A higher UV rate constant means that a microorganism or a virus is more easily inactivated by UV rays. The UV rate constant varies with the type of microorganism and virus; however, in general, it is known to be higher for viruses and bacteria than fungi [7] , as shown in Table 1 . Therefore, UR-UVGI systems are not appropriate for the removal of airborne fungal spores, accounting for the low UV rate constants of fungal spores and short exposure time to UV. However, ID-UVGI systems are considered effective for surface disinfection of fungal spores because long exposure time is available in air conditioning systems. The UV rate constant can also vary with the environmental conditions when microorganisms and viruses are exposed to UV. Most bacteria and viruses are more susceptible to UV in air than in water [24] , which enables UR-UVGI systems to inactivate them more effectively in air. Additionally, it is known that humidity can affect the UV susceptibilities of viruses and bacteria in air [25, 26] , but the effect was neglected in this study because their relationship is not clearly identified yet.",

The four-patient ward has a squared supply opening with fresh air flowing toward each patient at the center of the ceiling as shown in Fig. 3 and has one or two exhaust openings, depending on the case. The supply air has a velocity of 4.18 m/s, corresponding to a ventilation rate of about 11 times per hour. The UR-UVGI system is installed on the wall at a height of 2.4 m either above the door or beside the window, depending on the case, to radiate the UVC only to the upper area of the ward. The spatial distribution of the UVC intensity radiated from UR-UVGI systems measured by Sung et al. [13] was used in this study. Patients, simplified as boxes with dimensions 0.4 \u00c2 0.2 \u00c2 1.7 m, were placed on the beds either near door or the window and were constantly exhaling contaminants at an airflow of 0.24 l/s from their mouths. The temperature of the exhaled air was set to 32 C, and the heat generation of each patient's body was set to 24 W. Because the ward has absolute symmetry, only half of it was modeled for the calculation. Distributions of the airflow and the UV dose were calculated using a commercial CFD code, STAR-CD V.3.26 (CD-Adapco JAPAN Co., Ltd.), and the standard k-e model was used as a turbulence model. The other boundary conditions of CFD simulation are shown in Table 2 .",

If the air containing microorganisms or viruses stays longer near the UR-UVGI, where the UVC intensity is comparatively strong, the overall UV dose would be higher. Therefore the position of the UR-UVGI system is an important factor for the germicidal performance of the system in addition to the distribution of the airflow. The residence time of air in a UV-irradiated area is also affected by the composition of the exhaust air openings and the position of a source patient.",

Fig. 4 shows the contribution ratio of the air exhaled by a patient on the vertical section corresponding to patients' mouths, indicating how the air at any point is composed both of air exhaled by the patient and of air delivered by the ventilation system. In other words, the contribution ratios indicate the ratio of exhaled air to all of the air from outside of the ward. In all cases, the contribution ratios near the source patient are highest. However, the overall contribution ratios are of the order of \u00c03 because the flow rate of air exhaled by the patient (0.864 [m 3 /h]) is very small compared to that from the ventilation system (500 [m 3 /h]). The air from the patient tends to spread to the exhaust openings, so that the contribution ratios near the neighboring patient are lower in Cases 1-B and 2-B than in Cases 1-A and 2-A. Most of the air from patient B seems to be exhausted through the nearby exhaust opening before spreading to the neighboring patient A in Cases 1-B and 2-B. Conversely, dividing the exhaust opening caused a small rise in the contribution ratios near the neighboring patient as shown in Cases 1-B and 2-B, although this trend is not noticeably observed in Cases 1-A and 1-B. Fig. 5 shows the distribution of the SVE3*, which is the age of the exhaled air from a source patient. Overall, the distributions of the SVE3* were different from those of the contribution ratios in all cases because the contribution ratio at a location just defines the average mass ratio of the air from a patient, whereas the SVE3* is determined by the route and the duration time of the air from the patient to the location. The SVE3* values in the area of a neighboring patient indicate are comparatively low in the cases where patient A is a source, which means the air from patient A can reach the area of patient B more quickly than in reverse cases. The air from patient B flows predominately toward a nearby exhaust opening in Cases 1-B and 2-B, and therefore the contribution ratios near patient A are comparatively small. The time elapsed for the additional small amount of the air from patient B to reach patient A could be long, irrespective of the contribution ratios. Besides, the air from patient A tends to flow toward the one exhaust opening near patient B in Case 1-A, so the SVE3* near patient B is less than that in Case 2-A where the exhaust opening is divided into two.",

Relating this trend to the SVE3* distribution, the air immediately after exhalation from a source patient has less opportunity to be irradiated by UV rays because the SVE3*, the age of the exhaled air, was short near the source patient. Among the eight cases, Cases 1-A (window) and 1-B (window) where the UR-UVGI system is installed on the opposite side of the one exhaust opening show the highest UV dose distributions. Of the two cases, Case 1-B (windows) shows the highest UV dose distribution near the neighboring patient. Fig. 7 shows the average UV doses of the air exhaled by a source patient in the breathing zones (0.15 \u00c2 0.1 \u00c2 0.1 m directly over the mouth) of neighboring patients and the exhaust air. In all cases, the UV doses of the air exhaled from patient B were higher than those from patient A in the breathing zones of the neighboring patient, regardless of the position of the UR-UVGI system and the number of exhaust openings. However, the UV doses of the air exhaled from patient A were higher in the exhaust opening when only one exhaust opening was operated. The reason is because most of the air exhaled from patient B is assumed to be promptly exhausted through a nearby exhaust opening before being sufficiently irradiated by the UR-UVGI system. This trend was also observed in the cases where two exhaust openings were operated. Moreover, the UV doses of air exhaled from patient B were higher at the exhaust opening 2, located near patient B. In other words, the UV doses at the exhaust opening near the source patient were comparatively low in all cases.",

A new modified method using the concept of ventilation efficiency was introduced in this study. The results showed that the UV doses of the air exhaled by a source patient were correlated with SVE3*, the age of the exhaled air. The UV doses and the SVE3* are affected by the air movement, which is mostly affected by how the ventilation system is operated. However, a longer residence time of contaminated air is not always desirable because a longer age of the air does not guarantee a higher UV dose. A longer age of air without enough UV radiation in the lower area of the room could be contrarily harmful to the occupants. The UV doses, therefore, need to be estimated. In addition to the air movement, the position of the UR-UVGI system was another important factor for the germicidal effect in the case model study. The residence time of the air near the UR-UVGI system, where UV radiation was the strongest, was eventually decided by the air movement, not just by the position of the system. The effects of the position of the UR-UVGI system and the air movement on the UV doses were clearly illustrated using the method in the case study.
