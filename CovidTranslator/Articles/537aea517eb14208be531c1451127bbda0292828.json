A web-based program aggregates data based on an algorithm that provides potential signals of emerging public health events which are then reviewed by a multilingual, multidisciplinary team. An alert is sent out if a potential risk is identified. This process proved useful during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and was adopted shortly after by a number of countries to meet new International Health Regulations that require each country to have the capacity for early detection and reporting. The GPHIN identified the early SARS outbreak in China, was credited with the first alert on MERS-CoV and has played a significant role in the monitoring of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Future developments are being considered to advance the GPHIN's capacity in light of other Big Data sources such as social media and its analytical capacity in terms of algorithm development.",

The GPHIN continues to be maintained by the Public Health Agency of Canada (the Agency) and links a global network of public health professionals and organizations (e.g., Ministries of Health) for situational awareness and early detection of emerging public health events. The GPHIN relies on an automated web-based system that scans newspapers and other communications worldwide for potential indicators of outbreaks (or \"signals\") that are analyzed and rapidly assessed by a multilingual, multidisciplinary team at the Agency. When a risk is identified, analysts disseminate relevant information and alerts to senior officials and stakeholders for decision-making. While initially devised to identify communicable disease outbreaks, the system has also been used to monitor potential chemical and radio nuclear hazards (4, 6) .",
