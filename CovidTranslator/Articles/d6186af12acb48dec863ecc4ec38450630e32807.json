Although primarily responsible for mild infections including the common cold 2 reports of more severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections associated with HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have been documented. 3, 4 The identification of a coronavirus, SARS-CoV, as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 5 has resulted in an increased interest in this group of viruses. Subsequently two new human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 6,7 and HCoV-HKU1, 8 have been described. Both infect young children, the elderly and immunocompromised and can lead to severe respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalisation.

Due to limited resources, screening for other viruses such as enteroviruses, rhinoviruses and the other HCoVs was not undertaken. This may be considered a limitation of the study as there is accumulating evidence that these viruses, in particular rhinoviruses, may play a more significant role in lower respiratory tract infections than previously recognised. 10 The role and clinical significance of the recently identified human bocavirus 11 and polyomaviruses 12, 13 in respiratory disease is still under investigation. Ideally comprehensive screening of respiratory samples for most if not all respiratory viruses and relevant respiratory bacteria should be undertaken in order to obtain greater insight into the epidemiological significance of these pathogens in respiratory disease in the local setting. Further this would be beneficial to the clinical management of patients, including the administration of appropriate antiviral drugs and antibiotics. CMV was the most prevalent virus detected in the study samples. CMV-pneumonia is an important life-threatening complication in HIV-infected infants in South Africa. A post-mortem study of HIV-infected children in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa showed frequent (52%) CMV detection in lung tissue compared with uninfected controls (4%). 14 The significance of CMV detection in respiratory samples from uninfected children is not known but probably represents viral shedding from either a recently acquired primary infection or reactivation.",

HCoV-NL63 was found to circulate in infants and young children in both 2003 and 2004 with similar low prevalence rates of 0AE8%. This finding is lower than that reported in previous studies where detection of HCoV-NL63 ranged from 1% to 7AE3% 6,7,15-20 although higher prevalences of 8AE8% and 9AE3% have also been reported. 21, 22 Most HCoV-NL63-positive children (75%) were under 6 months, indicating that this younger age group may be more susceptible to severe infections requiring hospitalisation; a finding supported by other studies where 38 \u2044 76 (50%), 4 \u2044 5 (80%) and 11 \u2044 12 (92%) of HCoV-NL63 infections occurred in this age group respectively. 7, 19, 21 Further, immunosuppression may also contribute to increased susceptibility to severe HCoV-NL63 infection. In this study 4 \u2044 5 HCoV-NL63-infected whose HIV status was known, were HIV infected. All four were <4 months of age and two required admission to ICU. It is not known whether maternal antibodies, if present, would provide protection or reduce the severity of infection. This protection is likely to be most effective in infants under 2 months. In this study very few infected infants were under this age, indicating a possible protective advantage. This observation is supported by the findings of other studies. 7, [15] [16] [17] In a very recent study by Dijkman et al., HCoV-NL63 specific maternal antibodies were found in all newborns studied. These antibodies disappeared within 3 months providing further evidence of their possible protective role in early life.",

This is significantly different (P = 0AE0186) from the prevalence in the hospitalised group. This indicates that the virus is circulating in the community, probably causing mild symptoms which may trigger a wheezing episode requiring medical attention. In contrast the lower rate of HCoV-NL63 infection identified in the hospitalised children suggests that the virus rarely causes severe lower respiratory tract infections. However, all HCoV-infected children in the ambulatory group were over 12 months of age supporting the possibility that younger children are more susceptible to severe infections requiring hospitalisation.",
