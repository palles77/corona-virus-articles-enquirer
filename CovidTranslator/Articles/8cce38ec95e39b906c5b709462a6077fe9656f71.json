Some ED design lessons have been learned from terror events. From the Tokyo sarin gas event and other natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hospitals know they will need to plan for surge capacity. Methods of alerting ED staff early and protecting emergency care providers from contamination are needed, another lesson made clear by the Tokyo sarin gas event in which many emergency providers were contaminated. The New York City World Trade Center event illustrated the need to respond to a disaster scene and continue to treat a sustained increase in ED volume over prolonged periods. In New York, the clean-up phase after the event led to prolonged increased prehospital and ED volume. Most care was provided by emergency personnel working close to ground zero. From the anthrax mailings in the wake of the World Trade Center event, we can learn to anticipate the need for accurate public information.",

ED designers may not be able to create an \"all-risks-ready\"ED given financial constraints. However, incorporating disaster-ready suggestions when EDs are renovated or built new will improve our readiness and may be more financially feasible. New building materials, technologies, and concepts will continue to inform the effort to prepare EDs for terror attack. Urban ED trauma centers are attempting to develop capacity to serve as regional disaster resource centers and respond out to a terror event. These EDs are designed to incorporate larger waiting and entrance areas, adjacent units, or nearby parking spaces in their plans to ramp up treatment capacity. More decontamination and isolation capacity is being built to help control the spread of toxic or infectious agents. Information systems are being made available to provide real-time point-of-service information and any needed \"just in time\" training for potential terror threats. The technology needed to respond to a terrorist event, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), is becoming more widely available and is stored where easily available in EDs. Although mass decontamination can occur close to the disaster scene, EDs are gearing up to decontaminate, isolate, and treat individuals or groups contaminated with biologic or chemical materials. Four elements of ED design are being addressed to prepare EDs for terror events: scalability, security, information systems, and decontamination.",

            "text": "EDs are generally designed with sufficient, but not excess, space. The number of treatment spaces needed in an ED is usually matched to the anticipated ED patient volume; roughly 1 treatment space per 1100 annual ED visits or 1 treatment space per 400 annual ED hospital admissions is recommended. 1 According to disaster planners, a major urban trauma center ED built for 50,000 to 100,000 visits per year should have surge capacity up to 100 patients per hour for 4 hours and 1000 patients per day for 4 days. One Sept. 11 challenge is to provide \"surge capacity\" to meet anticipated patient needs. Hospitals are woefully overcrowded, and EDs are routinely housing admitted patients. [5] [6] [7] EDs are now being designed to allow \"growth\" into adjacent space: a ground level or upper level, a garage, or a parking lot. Garage and parking lot space has been used in many disaster drills and mass exposures. Garages and parking lots are more purposely designed with separate access to streets, allowing separation of disaster traffic and routine ED traffic. Needed terror-response supplies (e.g., antidotes, respirators, personal protective gear) are being stored near or within the ED. The cost of ventilation, heat, air conditioning, communication, and security features often prohibits renovation of garages. More often, tents are erected over parking lots or loading areas. Modular \"second EDs,\" tents or structures with collapsible walls (fold and stack), have been deployed by disaster responders. These can be used near the main ED, preserving the ED for critical cases. Some hospitals are considering beds in halls, patient rooms, and other spaces to increase their ability to generate surge capacity. Hallways can provide usable space if constructed wider and equipped with medical gases and adequate power and lighting. Often only minimal modifications are necessary to make existing halls and lobbies \"dual-use\" spaces. Some hospitals have increased space by installing retractable awnings on the exterior over ambulance bays or loading docks. Tents are often used outside EDs as decontamination and treatment areas in disaster drills. Tents with inflatable air walls have the added benefit of being insulated for all-weather use.",

Portable modular units are also available to help EDs address the space needs. Unfortunately, many EDs rely on other facilities in the regional system.

When selecting a sensor, designers consider sensitivity, selectivity, speed of response, and robustness. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Sensor technology is an area of active research that continues to yield new solutions that are being incorporated into EDs.

Adequate environmental protection for patients undergoing DECON is necessary and includes visual barriers from onlookers, segregation of the sexes, and attention to per-sonal belongings. 24, 25 In many EDs, DECON areas are being added to accommodate mass exposures. EDs have added or augmented DECON facilities. DECON areas should have a separate, self-contained drainage system, controlled water temperature, and shielding from environmental hazards. Exhaust fans are used to prevent the buildup of toxic fumes in these decontamination areas. For most EDs, mass DECON has been accomplished by using an uncovered parking lot and deploying heated and vented modular tent units. Uncovered parking areas adjacent and accessible to the ED have been enabled for disaster response. Other EDs use high-volume, lowpressured showers mounted on the side of a building. Serial showers allow multiple patients to enter at the same entrance and time. However, serial showers do not provide privacy, can be difficult for an ill patient to access, and can lead to recontaminated water runoff. Also, persons requiring more time may impede flow and reduce the number of patients decontaminated. Parallel showers built in advance or set up temporarily in tenting offer greater privacy but require wider space and depth. Combined serial and parallel design allows the advantages of each, separating ill patients and increasing the number of simultaneous decontaminations. 26 Often built into the ED is another DECON room for one or two patients with the following features: outside access; negative-pressure exhaust air exchange; water drainage; water recess; seamless floor; non-pervious, slipresistant, washable floor, walls, and ceiling; gas appliances; supplied air wall outlets for PPE use; high-input air; intercom; overhead paging; and an anteroom for DECON of isolated cases. PPE is recommended for use by military and fire departments during events involving hazardous materials. Hospitals use these devices and store a reasonable number of protective ensembles (i.e., gloves, suits, and respiratory equipment) usually near the ED DECON area. DECON areas are built with multiple supplied air outlets for PPE use to optimize safety and maximize work flexibility. A nearby changing area is available in some EDs. The changing area is laid out to optimize medical monitoring and to ease access to the DECON area. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Some capability to isolate and prevent propagation of a potential biologic agent has been designed into most EDs. Patients who present with undetermined respiratory illnesses are routinely sent to isolation. A direct entrance from the exterior to an isolation room is not usually available but has been a recent renovation in some EDs. Creation of isolation areas poses special design requirements for HVAC, cleaning, and security to ensure that infections and infected persons are contained. An isolation area should have compartmentalized air handling with high-efficiency filters providing clean air. [32] [33] [34] [35] Biohazard contamination is particularly difficult to mitigate. Keeping the facility \"clean\"and safe for other patients is an extreme challenge. Biologic agents of terrorism may resist decontamination attempts. Infected patients present a risk to staff. Few triage areas and ED rooms have been designed for decontamination. Surfaces must be able to withstand repeated decontamination. Sealed inlets for gases and plumbing have also been considered. [36] [37] [38] Patients who are isolated can be observed with monitoring cameras. Some isolation areas include a restroom within their space, which helps restrict patient egress.",

Infection control is improved using polymer surface coatings that are smooth, nonporous, and tolerant to repeated cleaning, creating a virtually seamless surface that is easy to clean. These coatings can be impregnated with antimicrobial properties enhancing their biosafe capability. Silverimpregnated metal surfaces in sinks, drains, door handles, and other locations can reduce high bacterial content. Silver-impregnated metal has demonstrated antimicrobial effects. 39 Conventional ventilation systems use 15% to 25% outside air during normal operation, thus purging indoor contaminants. Air cleaning depends on filtration, ultraviolet irradiation, and purging. HVAC design should model demand for adequately clean air and also for isolation of potential contaminants. 40 The disaster-ready ED requires protection from external contaminations as well as contagious patients. A compartmentalized central venting system without recirculation has the ability to remove or contain toxic agents in and around the ED. Compartmentalized HVAC systems allow for the \"sealing\" of zones from each other. More desirable HVAC systems electronically shut down sections, use effective filtration, and can \"clean\" contaminated air. A compartmentalized system can fail, but it only fails in the zone it is servicing; smaller zones mean smaller areas lost to contamination. These systems are less vulnerable to global failure or spread of contamination. Modular HVAC units developed for field military applications have been added to existing ED isolation areas for use when needed to create safe air compartments.",

Certainly the surge capacity of a \"terror-ready\" ED would be used for natural disaster response and in disaster drills.
