The viral infected cells exhibit a complicated cross-talking between autophagy and virus. It has been shown that autophagy interacts with both adaptive and innate immunity. For adaptive immunity, viral antigens can be processed in autophagosomes by acidic proteases before major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II presentation. For innate immunity, autophagy may assist in the delivery of viral nucleic acids to endosomal TLRs and also functions as a part of the TLR-or-PKR-downstream responses. Autophagy was also reported to suppress the magnitude of host innate antiviral immunity in certain cases. On the other hand, viruses has evolved many strategies to combat or utilize the host autophagy for their own benefit. In this review we discussed recent advances toward clarifying the cross-talking between autophagy and viral infection in mammalian cells.",

In that way, cytoplasmic materials in autophagosomes are released into the lysosome and subsequently consumed by hydrolases. Followed along with breakdown, the constituents are recycled through lysosomal transporters to the cytosol.",

            "text": "As a critical cellular process, autophagy interacts with many signal pathways. In the initial stage, the Beclin 1/ class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex acts as an important member of autophagic pathway, promoting the autophagosome formation (Kihara et al., 2001; Zeng et al., 2006) (Fig. 1A) . In contrast, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is known as the key downregulator of autophagy induction (Yang et al., 2005) , which can be inhibited by rapamycin and activated by amino acids. Several cascades are involved in mTOR pathway as well. Class I PI3K/Akt lies on the upstream of mTOR and acts positively on it to inhibit autophagy, whereas the phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) acts antagonistically to the class I PI3K to induce autophagy (Dan et al., 2008) . Besides, the UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1)autophagy-related protein 13 (Atg13)-FIP200 (a focal adhesion kinase [FAK] family-interacting protein of 200 kDa) complex is a direct target of mTOR and important regulator of autophagy in response to mTOR signaling. In detail, mTOR phosphorylates a mammalian homolog of Atg13 and the mammalian Atg1 homologs ULK1 and ULK2, and then the Atg13 binds to both ULK1 and ULK2 and mediates the interaction of the ULK proteins with FIP200. In these processes, the binding of Atg13 stabilizes and activates ULK and facilitate the phosphorylation of FIP200. FIP200 is a novel mammalian autophagy factor which plays essential role in autophagosome formation (Har et al., 2008) . mTOR also interacts with p53 family. Recently, it was demonstrated that mTOR can inhibit the p53 family member p73, which is capable inducing cellular autophagy and multiple autophagyassociated genes downstream of mTOR (Rosenbluth and Pietenpol, 2009 ). In addition the mTOR pathway is necessary for nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) mediated repression of autophagy in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1)-treated cell. In cells lacking NF-\u03baB activation, TNF\u03b1 treatment upregulates the expression of the autophagy-promoting protein Beclin 1 and subsequently induces the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (Dan et al., 2008; Rosenbluth and Pietenpol, 2009 ). Most importantly, autophagy also intersect with adaptive and innate immunity, this correlation will be discussed in the following paragraphs. Additionally, UV radiation resistance associated gene product (UVRAG) has been identified as a part of the PI3K/Beclin1 complex and representing an important signaling checkpoint in autophagy (Liang et al., 2006) , and BCL-2 is able to inhibit autophagy by binding to Beclin 1 as a negative regulator of Beclin 1/classIII PI3K complex (Fig. 1B) .",

Several studies have unraveled the potential important roles that autophagy plays in the MHC class II antigen presentation process. When investigating the MHC class II-restricted presentation of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1), it was observed that blocking lysosomal acidification led to accumulation of EBNA-1 in intracellular vesicles positive for LAMP-1 and co-staining with MDC (a fluorescent dye that labels autophagosomes). MHC class II-restricted presentation of endogenous EBNA-1 to T cells was reduced by 30%-70% when autophagy was blocked (Paludan et al., 2005; Strawbridge and Blum, 2007) . Similarly, in another study, targeting the influenza matrix protein 1 (MP1) to the autophagosome by fusing with the ubiquitin-like protein Atg8 (known as LC3 in mammalian cells) significantly enhanced the delivery of the antigen for MHC class II presentation to MP1-specific CD4 T cells. And the Atg12-targeted siRNA is able to reduce T cell response. Obviously, cytosolic antigens can be delivered to the MHC class II compartment via autophagy for enhanced MHC class II presentation to CD4 T cells. However, the MHC class I presentation was not affected in these studies (Schmid et al., 2007) . More studies are still needed to clarify the mechanisms of autophagy in MHC class II presentation. Such knowledge will be very helpful for designing more effective vaccines in the prevention of infectious diseases.",

            "text": "As an important family of PRRs, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) family includes more than 10 members that have been identified so far. TLRs mainly expressed on antigenpresenting cells, such as macrophages or dendritic cells, and play critical roles to provoke innate immunity and establish adaptive immunity. Besides the common effects, such as inflammatory cytokine induction or upregulation of costimulatory molecule expression, each TLR has its specific functions, which are not only critical in antimicrobial immunity but also involved in manifestations of Fig. 1 The cross-talking between viruses and host cells. A: Beclin1 is a component PI3K/Beclin1 complex which acts an important role in the initial stage of autophagy. UVRAG is a part of the PI3K/Beclin1 complex and representing an important signaling checkpoint in autophagy, while BCL-2 is able to inhibit autophagy by interacting with Beclin 1 as a negative regulator. It is because the essential roles of PI3K/Beclin1 complex, several viruses evolve some strategies to combat or employ it for their own benefits. HSV-1 expresses protein ICP34.5, HIV-1 has Nef, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) produces vBCL-2 and the murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 68 encodes protein M11, as well as HBV express protein HBx to suppress autophagy by blocking the Beclin1. B: mTOR is known as the key downregulator of autophagy induction, which can be inhibited by rapamycin and activated by amino acids. Class I PI3K/Akt lies on the upstream of mTOR and acts positively on it to inhibit autophagy, whereas the phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) acts antagonistically to the class I PI3K to induce autophagy indirectly. Besides, the ULK-Atg13-FIP200 complexe is a direct target of mTOR and important regulator of autophagy in response to mTOR signaling. Additionally, mTOR activity inhibits p73, which is the inducer of cellular autophagy, and in TNF\u03b1-treated cell, mTOR is necessary for NF-\u03baB activation mediated repression of autophagy. In HCMV infected cells, mTOR can be activated to suppress autophagy for its own benefits. C: When viruses replicating in cells, the viral dsRNA activates PKR to phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 and then mediate viruses degradation through autophagy. However, HSV-1 has possibility encoding ICP34.5 to suppress cellular autophagy by dephosphorylating eIF2\u03b1 in PKR pathway. In pDCs, the autophagic vesicles can wrap the replication intermediate of escaped VSV in cytoplasmic and then fuse with endosome who contain TLR7 to recognize viral replication intermediate to produce IFN-\u03b1. As we know, the viral dsRNA also stimulates IFN-\u03b1 production via RIG-1 and ISP-1. Interestingly, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), the IFN-\u03b1 production can be down-regulated in response to VSV by Atg5-Atg12 direct association with both RIG-I and IPS-1 through the caspase recruitment domains. For adaptive immunity, autophagy can deliver antigens into autophagosomes for processing by acidic proteases before MHC class II presentation. For example, autophagy helps presentation of endogenous EBNA-1 to T cells in EBV infected cells. D: Besides, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR7 are able to induce autophagy in certain cells. MHV, Poliovirus and CVB3 as well as HCV are capable inducing autophagosomes to generate sites and support their replication. Besides, HCV and CVB3 can suppress autophagic protein degradation by blocking the fusion of autophagosome and lysosome. Certain viruses such as enterovirus 71, influenza A virus, BVDV, human parvovirus B19 and dengue virus-2 are able to activate autophagy to enhance the efficiency of viral replication, but detail mechanisms are still unclear. More interestingly, Env of HIV is able to induce autophagy and accumulate the Beclin 1 in uninfected cells via CXCR4 autoimmunity (Kaisho and Akira, 2006) . Recently, TLRs has been described to cooperate with cellular autophagy to support delivering viral nucleic acids and producing certain cytokines. In vesicular stomatitus virus (VSV) infected plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), autophagy was found to be required for the recognition of VSVs by TLR7 and the production of IFN-\u03b1 by pDCs. After treating with the inhibitors of autophagy, 3-methyladenine and Wortmannin, the production of IFN-\u03b1 was significantly decreased. Furthermore, Atg5 deleted pDCs and ATG5 -/chimera mice failed to secrete IFN-\u03b1 in response to VSV infection in vitro and in vivo. The author speculated that pDCs can utilize autophagic vesicle to wrap the replication intermediate of escaped VSV in cytoplasmic, and fuse with endosome who contain TLR7, and then the replication intermediate could be recognized by TLR7 to start production of cytokines such as IFN-\u03b1 (Lee et al., 2007) .",

Some TLRs were reported having the ability to activate autophagy, such as TLR3, TLR4, TLR7 and other TLR family members.

When knocking-down the expression of Beclin 1, MYD88 or TRIF by shRNA, the induction of autophagy was also inhibited. MyD88 and TRIF could co-immunoprecipitate with Beclin1. It was proposed that by recruiting Beclin 1 into the TLRsignaling complex, MYD88 and/or TRIF reduced the binding of Beclin 1 to Bcl-2 which is an important autophagy inhibitor and then upregulate cellular autophagy (Delgado et al., 2008; Shi and Kehrl, 2008) .",

Further research identified several hallmarks of cellular autophagosomes in poliovirus-induced vesicles, including co-localization of LAMP1 and LC3. Different from that autophagy helps antigen presentation in EBV infected cells as described above, the autophagic process supports the poliovirus replication. Inhibition of the autophagosomal pathway by 3-methyladenine or RNAi treatment to reduce LC3 or Atg12p concentrations reduced poliovirus yield . How the autophagic vesicles affect the virus multiplication? The researchers proposed that poliovirus may exploit the autophagic machinery for viral RNA replication and/or the non-lytic release of the cytoplasmic viruses. There are some observations supporting this hypothesis. LC3 and the poliovirus capsid protein VP1 present in extracellular structures adjacent in poliovirus-infected cells, and the RNA replication complexes co-localize with autophagosomes. The reduction of extracellular virus yield is more than intracellular virus yield after treating with RNAi to LC3 or Atg12p . However, the details remain unclear.

Recent studies showed that the viral RNA replication occurs on cytoplasmic double membrane vesicles derived from the autophagic pathway, and the viral yield of extracellular virus is significantly diminished in clonal isolates of Atg5 -/mouse embryonic stem cells (Kirkegaard et al., 2004; Prentice et al., 2004) , which indicate that the MHV requires the autophagic pathway to form infectious virions. There are two hypotheses on the mechanism of the activation of autophagic pathway during the MHV infection. First, the double-stranded RNA generated during viral replication may activate protein kinase R and stimulate autophagy. Alternatively, MHV bind directly to the cellular receptor, Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM-1), and induce signaling events that result in autophagy. Encouragingly, in another member of Coronaviridae, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus infected cells; the double membrane vesicles were also observed (Snijder et al., 2006) . The relationship between SARS infection and autophagy is interesting and should be focused more. If the components of the autophagic pathway are required for formation of a viral replication complex and for efficient viral growth, the new target for treatment to SARS will be brought.",

In CVB3 infected cells, the number of double-membrane vesicles increased, accompanied by an increase of the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and an accumulation of punctate GFP-LC3expressing cells, two markers of cellular autophagosome formation. The inhibition and induction autophagy can reduce and increase viral replication. But p62, the marker for autophagy-mediated protein degradation, showed no apparent changes, which suggested that CVB3 infection triggers autophagosome formation without promoting protein degradation by the lysosome. Furthermore, the blockage of autophagosome-lysosome fusion significantly promoted viral replication (Wong et al., 2008) . To support their replication, viruses may use the membrane structure of autophagosome, but they have to escape the digestion in lysosome. How to do these contradictory things? The strategy of CVB3 virus to block the autophagosomelysosome fusion is an efficient way. Using the stimulator of autophagosome-lysosome fusion will be a method to suppress CVB3 replication.",

It is suggested that the induction of autophagosomes by HCV is dependent on the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response related to the endoplasmic reticulum which is activated in response to an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The inhibitor of UPR is able to suppress HCV-induced autophagosome accumulation. At the same time, the replication of HCV can be decreased by UPR's inhibitor (Sir et al., 2008a) . That is to say, autophagy is important to support infection of HCV. In fact, cellular autophagic proteins, such as Beclin-1, Atg4B, Atg5, and Atg12, act as proviral factors, which initiate the infection of HCV. These autophagy-related proteins are required for translation of viral RNA . Possibly, autophagic factors help viral RNA binding to translation complex, and may recruit cellular factors for translation of HCV. As expected, silencing of autophagy-related genes by siRNA transfection significantly slowed down the replication of HCV replicon (Sir et al., 2008b) (Fig. 1D) .",

            "text": "Autophagy can also be induced in EV71 infected cells, and further enhances virus replication. This induction was inhibited by the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA with decreased LC3 aggregation and decreased virus titer. In contrast, autophagy in EV71 infected cells was further enhanced by tamoxifen and rapamycin, LC3 aggregation and virus titer accordingly increased (Huang et al., 2009) . Besides, two other human RNA viruses, dengue virus (DV) and influenza A viruses (IAV) also reported as a autophagy inducer. The autophagic process is triggered after infecting, and the autophagic machinery is favorable for viral replication (Lee et al., 2008 , Zhou et al., 2009 ). However, how viruses stimulate autophagy and which part of autophagic process support viral infection are still obscure. Maybe there is a common mechanism to utilize the cellular autophagy for viral infection, such as using autophagosome to replicate viral nuclear acid, or to release virion. Not only RNA virus, but also DNA virus applies certain strategy to take over autophagic process. Human parvovirus B19 is one of the smallest single-stranded DNA virus, which lacks an envelope and infects erythroid cells to cause several diseases. B19 infection can induces cell cycle arrest at G1 and G2/M phases, and apoptosis. Morita et al. has reported a typical kinetics of B19 infection, in which most of the infected cells got arrested at G2 phase within 12 h after the infection, then survived up to 72 h, and started dying accompanied with viral replication (Morita and Sugamura, 2002) . Recently, it was demonstrated that B19 infection also induced an intracellular autophagosome as judged by endogenous LC3 staining. B19-induced autophagy occurs in the later time point, mostly at 48 to 96 h after the infection. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA significantly facilitated B19-infection-mediated cell death that suggested a novel mechanism by which B19-infected cells survived (Nakashima et al., 2006) (Fig.  1D) . We can speculate that autophagy-mediated survival of B19-infected cells may potentially leave more time periods for the viral replication. However, further studies are still needed to verify the true effects of autophagy on the replication of B19.",

When primary human fibroblasts were infected with Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the autophagosome formation was obviously inhibited. This inhibition occurred early in the infection by a mechanism involving viral protein(s). Indeed, only infected cells expressing viral protein(s) displayed a striking decrease of autophagy; whereas bystander, noninfected cells displayed a level of autophagy similar to that of control cells. It was observed that infection with HCMV induced rapid phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70S6K who are two of mTOR substrates. Therefore the mTOR signaling pathway was stimulated by HCMV and rendered infected cells resistant to autophagy. To be noted, infected cells also became resistant to the stimulation of autophagy by lithium chloride, an mTOR-independent inducer of autophagy. So other step(s) should also be targeted by HCMV to block autophagy (Chaumorcel et al., 2008) (Fig.  1B) . Recently, it was found that Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection-induced autophagy was through mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway, this induction is cell-type specific in SK-N-SH cells, however, class I PI3K/Akt was not the upstream transducer (Huang et al., 2009) .",

Previous researches have shown that the GADD34 domain could recruit a host phosphatase, PP1\u03b1, to dephosphorylate eIF-2\u03b1. An ICP34.5 deletion mutant virus has been shown to promote autophagy in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared with the wild type virus, but it no longer triggers autophagy in the PKR -/and Ser-51 nonphosphorylatable mutant eIF2\u03b1 MEFs, which suggest that PKR-eIF2\u03b1 signaling is the target of ICP34.5 for antagonizing autophagy. However, ICP34.5 also modulates autophagy through binding to Beclin1. The binding of ICP34.5, either directly or indirectly, to Beclin 1 is required for its autophagy-inhibitory function (Leib et al., 2000; Tall\u00f3czy et al., 2006; Alexander et al., 2007; Orvedahl et al., 2007) . This viral evolution is compatible with Darwin's theory of evolution, and the HSV-1 who expresses the ICP34.5 is the survival of the fittest. Otherwise, it will be cleared.",

Until not long ago, a novel function of HBx in increasing autophagy through the upregulation of Beclin1 expression were found. Overexpression of HBx results in the upregulation of the endogenous mRNA and protein levels of Beclin 1 in the tested cells (Tang et al., 2009) . Why HBV upregulate autophagy is still unclear. But there is very useful information that HBx might bind the promoter of Beclin1 to upregulate its expression. Investigating the structure of HBx is a potential way to design or find an autophagy stimulator which can be utilized to study the cellular autophagy (Fig. 1A) .",

Some viruses can exploit autophagy with special ways, for example, Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) which belongs to the flavivirus family. Interestingly, the genome of the cytopathogenic BVDV contains a cellular insertion coding for microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3(LC3) which is one of the autophagic markers. This genome insertion has been reported to enhance the pathogenicity of the virus and the insertion is somehow associated with the expression of the viral nonstructural protein NS3, in most cases by induction of proteolytic processing at the LC3/NS3 fusion site, exactly at the amino acid of the LC3 sequence glycine 120. The mammalian protease Atg4 which can process LC3 for its coupling to autophagosomal membranes can also efficiently cleaves the LC3/NS3 fusion expressed in LC3-positive cytopathogenic BVDV. This virus may use proteolytic event of the autophagy machinery to facilitate the expression of viral protein and enhance its own replication (Fricke et al., 2004) (Fig. 1D) .",

            "text": "Different from BVDV, Human immunodeficiency virus type1(HIV-1) which is the pathogen of AIDS uses more powerful strategies to employ autophagy. HIV-1 express envelope glycoproteins (Env) in infected cells, and then the Env bind to CXCR4 on the surface of uninfected cells to induce autophagy and accumulate the Beclin 1. This Envmediated autophagy is required to trigger the apoptosis of bystander CD4 + T cell since blockade of autophagy at different steps, by either drugs or siRNAs specific for Beclin 1 and Atg7 genes totally inhibited the apoptotic process (Espert et al., 2006; Denizot et al., 2008) . But what's the benefit of inducing bystander CD4 + T cells death? Obviously, HIV-1 killed their enemy cells to pave their way. The power of HIV-1 is not limited to kill bystander CD4 + T cells; recently, it was found that cellular autophagy can be controlled by HIV-1 to promote its yields in infected cells. First, HIV Gag-derived proteins colocalized and interacted with the autophagy factor LC3, and autophagy is able to promote productive Gag processing. Secondly, to avoid degradation in maturation stages of autophagy, HIV-1 protein Nef acts as an anti-autophagic maturation factor through interactions with the autophagy regulatory factor Beclin 1, thus protecting HIV from degradation (Kyei et al., 2009 ). In conclusion, HIV-1 evolved diverse strategies to support its infection and replication by taking over autophagy: first, the protein Env leads to the apoptosis of bystander CD4 + T cells via autophagy pathway, and then HIV-1 can enhance viral yields by using the early stages while inhibiting the late stages of autophagy ( Fig. 1A and D) .",

First, autophagy was identified to be involved in the infection of many common viruses, such as HIV, IAV and HBV. Some of these viruses can inhibit autophagy to evade the clearance of host immune system, and others are able to take over certain autophagic steps, thus contributing to viral infection and replication. Secondly, autophagy interacts with both adaptive and innate immunity. Here, we would like to ask: if the similar viruses have a common crosstalking with autophagy? Could we find this common relation to support potential antiviral therapy? Is there any relationship between autophagy and the carcinogenicity of certain virus? Understanding how autophagy defends against viral infection and how virus infection stimulates autophagy-related cellular pathways for its own replication is a challenge and opportunity for the future. To uncover these mechanisms may open up great potential of autophagy for vaccines and antiviral drugs development.",
