Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is considered to be the etiological factor for cervical cancer. Therefore, an effective vaccine against HPV infections may lead to the control of cervical cancer. An ideal HPV vaccine should aim to generate both humoral immune response to prevent new infections as well as cell-mediated immunity to eliminate established infection or HPV-related disease. In the current study, we have generated a potential preventive and therapeutic HPV DNA vaccine using human calreticulin (CRT) linked to HPV16 early proteins, E6 and E7 and the late protein L2 (hCRTE6E7L2). We found that vaccination with hCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine induced a potent E6/E7-specific CD8 + T cell immune response, resulting in a significant therapeutic effect against E6/E7 expressing tumor cells. In addition, vaccination with hCRTE6E7L2 DNA generated significant L2-specific neutralizing antibody responses, protecting against pseudovirion infection. Thus, the hCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccines are capable of generating potent preventive and therapeutic effects in vaccinated mice. Our data has significant clinical implications.",

Current strategies for the development of safe and effective preventive vaccines are based on the induction of neutralizing antibodies against the major and minor capsid proteins, L1 and L2 of human papillomavirus. The newly licensed preventive HPV vaccine, Gardasil, which is an L1-based vaccine, has both a remarkable safety profile and clinical efficacy against the HPV genotypes from which it was derived. However, Gardasil is likely only effective against a subset of HPV genotypes, types 16, 18, 6 and 11, and therefore does not provide complete protection against all cervical cancers. As an alternative approach, the minor capsid protein L2 has arisen as a possible target for vaccine development. Importantly, vaccination with L2 induces broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies that mediate broader protection [6] . This is a significant advantage for L2-based vaccines and thus this approach is emerging as a promising candidate for the development of a broadly protective vaccine.",

DNA vaccines generate effective CTL and antibody responses by delivering foreign antigen to APCs that stimulate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Compared to live viral or bacterial vectors, naked DNA plasmid vaccines are relatively safe and can be easily administered. Furthermore, DNA vaccines are easy to prepare on a large scale with high purity and high stability and can be engineered to express antigenic peptides or proteins (for reviews, see [7, 8] ). Additionally, DNA has the unique ability to be maintained long term in an episomal form [9] . This enables prolonged expression of antigens and enhancement of immunologic memory. Using DNA vaccines to express proteins bypasses MHC restriction and thus maintains higher CTL responses than current protein vaccines. DNA vaccines can also be repeatedly applied to the same patient safely and effectively, unlike live vectors vaccines. These features make DNA vaccines a potentially plausible approach for HPV vaccine development. While DNA has considerable advantages, one major limitation is its limited potency. This is due to the fact that DNA vaccines, unlike viral vectors lack the intrinsic ability to amplify in transfected cells.",

CRT is an abundant 46 kDa Ca 2+ -binding protein which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [10] . CRT is considered to be related to the family of heat shock proteins (HSPs) [11, 12] . This protein has been shown to associate with peptides delivered into the ER by transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP-1 and TAP-2) [13] and with MHC class I-\u03b22 microglobulin molecules to aid in antigen presentation [14] . We have previously employed this CRT-based enhancement strategy to create effective DNA vaccines using HPV-16 E6 [15] , E7 [16] or SARS-Co-V [17] as target antigens. We have shown that DNA vaccines encoding calreticulin (CRT) linked to the target antigen generate the high levels of antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell responses as well as significant antigen-specific humoral immunity [15] [16] [17] . Thus, we employed CRT in our HPV DNA vaccine developement in order to generate strong T cell specific responses as well as humoral responses against the HPV antigens, E6, E7 and L2. The employment of E6, E7 and L2 protein of HPV16 has been previously explored in protein-based vaccines to generate a chimeric L2E7E6 fusion protein (also called TA-CIN [18, 19] ). Vaccination of healthy volunteers with TA-CIN induced serum antibody that neutralizes across papillomavirus species [20] .",

ELISA analysis was performed to determine the levels of L2specific antibody in vaccinated mice. As shown in Figure 5A and B, there was a significant level of L2-specific antibody response in the mice vaccinated with DNA vaccine expressing hCRTE6E7L2 intradermally via gene gun or intramuscularly compared to that in mice vaccinated with DNA vaccine expressing hCRTE6E7. Furthermore, L2-specific antibody responses in mice vaccinated with the hCRTE6E7L2 DNA were comparable to the L2-specific antibody responses in mice vaccinated with 4a-L2 or 4a-hCRTL2 DNA (p>0.05). In addition, the L2-specific antibody responses in the mice vaccinated intramuscularly were comparable to that in mice vaccinated intradermally. Thus, our data suggest that mice vaccinated with the DNA vaccine expressing hCRTE6E7L2 are capable of generating significant levels of L2specific antibody in vaccinated mice.",

Thus, it is important to use attenuated (detox) versions of E6 and E7 that have been mutated. It has been demonstrated that a mutation at E7 position 24 and/or 26 will disrupt the Rb binding site of E7, abolishing the capacity of E7 to transform cells [32] . Furthermore, mutation at E6 positions 63 or 106 has been shown to destroy several HPV-16 E6 functions, preventing the mutated E6 protein from immortalizing human epithelial cells [33, 34] . The constructs used in the current study employ attenuated (detox) forms of E6 and E7, thus eliminating any safety concerns that may arise.",

Indeed, a previous study by Peng et al has demonstrated that simultaneous vaccination of C57BL/6 mice or HLA-A2 transgenic mice with both CRT/E6 and CRT/E7 DNA vaccines generates significant E6and E7-specific T-cell immune responses in vaccinated mice. Furthermore, combined vaccination with both CRT/E6 and CRT/E7 DNA generates significantly better therapeutic antitumor effects against HPV E6-and E7-expressing tumors than vaccination with either CRT/ E6 DNA or CRT/E7 DNA alone [35] .

Thus, the strategy of employing CRT to enhance the antigen-specific antibody responses in DNA vaccines in clearly depends on the nature of the antigen.
