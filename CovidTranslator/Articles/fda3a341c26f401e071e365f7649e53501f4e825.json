This review aims to systematically combine and evaluate the available literature of the prevalence of respiratory viruses in patients with AECOPD, detected by PCR. Methods: An electronic search strategy was performed on PubMed and Embase and reference lists were screened for eligible studies. Cross-sectional, prospective studies and case-control studies were included. The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of respiratory viruses (adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, EBV, hMPV, influenza, parainfluenza, rhino-/enterovirus, RSV) in respiratory secretions of patients during an AECOPD. Secondary outcomes were the odds of the presence of the viruses in different respiratory secretions and the odds of the presence of viruses in upper and lower respiratory tract (URT/LRT) samples.",

Adenovirus (2.07%), hMPV (2.78%) and bocaviruses (0.56%) appear to be rare causative agents of AECOPD. Definitive conclusions regarding the role of EBV cannot be made. Seven of the eight analyzed viruses had a higher prevalence in LRT samples. Coronaviruses were detected more frequently in the URT. Conclusions: Respiratory viruses are frequently detected in both URT and LRT samples in AECOPD with rhino-/enteroviruses, RSV and influenza viruses the most prevalent viruses. Detection rates vary between the two sites for different viruses.",

            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airflow obstruction with the most important risk factor for the development of COPD being exposure to cigarette smoke. The course of the disease is progressive and punctuated by the occurrence of exacerbations that can accelerate lung function decline and increase mortality [1, 2] . The global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) classification defines an exacerbation as \"an acute event characterized by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variations and leads to a change in medication\" [3] . Mortality in COPD increases with the number of exacerbations [2] and exacerbations often lead to hospitalization with high treatment costs [1] . Therefore, prevention and optimal management is of high importance. Acute exacerbations are frequently triggered by respiratory tract infections [3] . Respiratory viruses are frequently detected in COPD exacerbations [4] , but their role in the pathogenesis remains unclear [5] . The first studies investigating a possible causal role of viruses in COPD exacerbations identified respiratory viruses by serology and viral culture; however, detection rates were generally low. More recently, more sensitive and specific diagnostic methods have become available for detection of respiratory viruses utilizing PCR and its derived forms [6] . Despite the increasing knowledge on the role of viruses in exacerbations of COPD, it is less clear which viruses are involved and to what extent they contribute to exacerbations. The prevalence of viral infection detected by PCR in COPD exacerbations has been reviewed systematically by Mohan [7] . The review demonstrated the relatively high prevalence of picornaviruses and influenza viruses in COPD exacerbations [7] ; however, only eight studies were included. In order to further investigate the role of respiratory viral infections in COPD exacerbations on the basis of more recent studies, the present review systematically evaluates additional publications based on an extended selection of articles, selected by a more systematic search strategy. Beside the pooled prevalences of the respiratory viruses, detection in the upper respiratory tract (URT) or the lower respiratory tract (LRT) are also evaluated.",

Also, the study of Camargo reported a relatively low prevalence of 5.26% [22] but this may be accounted for by the fact that the study was performed during the winter only.

RSV and influenza viruses were also major contributors to COPD exacerbations with pooled prevalence rates of 9.90% and 7.83%, respectively. However, the rhino-/enteroviruses detection rates differed markedly between studies. Influenza was present in almost half of the patients in the study of Zakharkina [26] , whereas Seemungal observed a prevalence of only 1.19% [24] . In addition, Tan found a relatively high prevalence of 35.71% and the authors of the article claimed that this prevalence was due to the low number of influenza vaccinated patients [20] . However, the percentage of vaccinated patients was not reported. No relationship between the percentage of vaccinated patients and the prevalence of influenza infections was found in this review ( Table 5 ). The influenza A virus was the most common influenza type detected [11, 12, 14, 15, 17, [20] [21] [22] 25, 27] apart from the study of Seemungal where influenza B virus was more prevalent [24] . Influenza viruses were detected in 5.43% of URT samples and in 9.88% of LRT samples, with the highest detection rates in induced sputum (11.14%). The prevalence of RSV varied from <3% [11, 14, 17, 20, 27] to 40.50% in the study by Dimopoulos [12] . The authors suggested that the relatively high prevalence was due to limitations of multiplex PCR, since distinction between carriage and active infection was not possible [12] . On the other hand, other studies demonstrated lower prevalences of RSV using the same PCR technique [14, 17, 21, 27] . Based on these results, there was no association between the PCR method used (i.e. nested PCR, multiplex PCR and RT-PCR) and the prevalence observed. qRT-PCR could offer a solution and studies using this technique demonstrated a significant higher sensitivity, compared to nested PCR [28] . Other respiratory viruses detected at lower rates included parainfluenza (3.35%), coronaviruses (4.08%), adenoviruses (2.07%), hMPV (2.78%), bocavirus (0.56%), but again there were considerable differences between individual studies in virus detection rates. The pooled prevalence of adenovirus in COPD exacerbations was 2.07% but was much higher in two studies of McManus and the study of Tan [9, 11, 20] . McManus and co-authors explained their high detection rates with a higher sensitivity of the nested PCR compared to other PCR-techniques [9] . Only two studies investigated the role of human bocavirus [27, 29] and we found a pooled prevalence of 0.56%, consequently it may not be a significant cause of COPD exacerbations, but further studies are needed for more definite conclusions. Since only a single study investigated the role of EBV in exacerbations of COPD, definitive conclusions regarding its role cannot be made [10] . Additionally, the risk of bias of this paper is relatively high (7/14 points), despite the high number of patients. The prevalence observed was high (47.79%) and it is surprising that none of the other included papers detected this particular virus and further research is necessary to elucidate the possible role of EBV in exacerbations of COPD.",

First of all, there is the risk of publication bias as studies with negative results may not be reported. However, this is less likely as studies with a wide range of virus detection rates have been published and are included in this review. It was assumed that sputum was not contaminated with material from the URT. Since contamination cannot be ruled out, this assumption could generate wrong conclusions. Most respiratory viruses exhibit a strong winter predominance (e.g. RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus), but the rhino-/enteroviruses circulate mainly in the autumn and spring [22, 30, 31] . Since not all studies were conducted in the same season(s), seasonal bias cannot be ruled out. Adding the seasonal bias to the criteria of quality assessment could offer a solution.",
