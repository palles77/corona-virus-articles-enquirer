Methods: A retrospective investigation was conducted with ADEM patients in Nanjing, Nantong, Yancheng and Xuzhou. The survey was carried out in regions that might have received patients meeting the case definition of ADEM provided by the International Pediatric MS Study Group from 2008 to 2011. A total of 125 hospitals were included and 412 patients were identified through the hospital information systems (HIS). Results: The incidence of ADEM was 0.32/100,000/year. There are two peaks on the age-specific ADEM rates curve. One is 0.77/100,000/year among 0-to 9-year-olds, the other is 0.45/100,000/year in those aged 5059 years. The incidence rate found for ADEM in males was 0.34/100,000/year, and in females was 0.29/100,000/year. The highest incidence rate was in Nanjing (0.40/100,000/year). Conclusions: The average annual incidence of ADEM was 0.32/100,000/year. The peak age of onset was 5059 years old and 09 years old. The incidence among males was insignificantly higher than that among females. There was no significant difference in incidence by seasonal variation.",

            "text": "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) disorder. 1 It is characterized by an acute encephalopathy with polyfocal neurological deficits. In the absence of specific biological markers the diagnosis of ADEM is still based on clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of widespread demyelination, after ruling out other possible explanations for an acute encephalopathy. 2 In 2007 the International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Study Group proposed a consensus definition for ADEM for application in research and clinical settings. 3 The pathogenesis of ADEM is not fully known, but adhesion molecules, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinase, and other cell factors can play important roles in its occurrence and development. 4 Formerly, ADEM occurred particularly often in children with measles. However, the disease most often follows a nondescript viral or even bacterial infectious illness. Many identifiable infections have been associated with ADEM, such as measles, mumps, rubella, coxsackie, coronavirus, herpes, influenza A and B, hepatitis A and B, human T-lymphotropic virus-1, human immunodeficiency virus, dengue virus, or smallpox. 5 In addition to a known association with infections, vaccinations (e.g. rabies, smallpox or measles vaccines) have also been suggested to increase the risk of ADEM. 6 There have been many recent studies showing no long-term association between vaccinations and ADEM. 7 In recent years, the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) has been carried out in China. The type and number of vaccines administered to residents were expanded. The probability of having an abnormal reaction such as ADEM to vaccines is small, but the occurrences of such reactions increased after the EPI, causing widespread public concern. This may reduce public confidence in vaccines. When evaluating the risk of vaccines leading to ADEM or when judging whether ADEM has a causal association with vaccination, epidemiological features and population-level baseline incidence rates, in addition to clinical characteristics and disease diagnosis, must be assessed. A firm measure of the incidence of ADEM is increasingly important.",

Predominant age of occurrence in children is 58 years, 6, 1417 or mainly in children and young people. 18 Pohl et al. reported that the incidence rate of ADEM was 0.09/ 100,000/year among children less than 10 years old and 0.03/100,000/year among children 1015 years old in Germany. 9 In Canada, children with ADEM were more likely to be younger than 10 years. 19 Previous studies on ADEM have focused on children but rarely on adults. Our study found that the highest incidence rate was among individuals 09 years old (0.77/100,000/year), and the incidence decreased with the increase of age among people less than 50 years old. But the incidence increased among people 5059 years old (0.45/100,000/year), followed by individuals 6069 years old (0.43/100,000/year). Senile ADEM, which attracts much of our attention, has rarely been reported. 20 It is probably due to: (1) differences between the elderly and young people in susceptibility or immune response to infectious agents, and (2) lack of sensitive tools to examine patients before the widespread use of MRI. 21 Some studies have reported no gender predominance in children. 10, 13, 22 Pohl et al. reported that the female-to-male ratio was balanced up to the age of 13 years, and more than twice as many girls than boys were reported in the 14-to 15-year-old group of children in Germany. 9 Our study found that males had an insignificantly higher risk of ADEM; the male/female ratio was 1.17. This frequency distribution has also been observed by others. 15, 23 A maleto-female incidence ratio that changes with advanced age may suggest differential referral, detection, or access to a neurologist. Generally, older women and men with neural disorders may be differentially referred from their households or homes to hospitals.",

The clinical presentation must be polysymptomatic and must include encephalopathy. Event should be followed by improvement, either clinically, on MRI, or both, but there may be residual deficits. No history of a clinical episode with features of a prior demyelinating event. No other etiologies can explain the event. New or fluctuating symptoms, signs, or MRI findings occurring within three months of the inciting ADEM event are considered part of the acute event. Neuroimaging shows focal or multifocal lesion(s), predominantly involving white matter, without radiologic evidence of previous destructive white matter changes.8 Some of the cases were from foreign cities. They were excluded from the numerator because these cases would affect the accuracy of local incidence assessment. The Poisson model was used to calculate",
