            "text": "Between September 2012 and January 20, 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) received reports from 27 countries of 1879 laboratory-confirmed cases in humans of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by infection with the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and at least 659 related deaths. Cases of MERS-CoV infection continue to occur, including sporadic zoonotic infections in humans across the Arabian Peninsula, occasional importations and associated clusters in other regions, and outbreaks of nonsustained human-to-human transmission in health care settings. Dromedary camels are considered to be the most likely source of animal-to-human transmission. MERS-CoV enters host cells after binding the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) receptor and the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell-adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) cofactor ligand, and it replicates efficiently in the human respiratory epithelium. Illness begins after an incubation period of 2 to 14 days and frequently results in hypoxemic respiratory failure and the need for multiorgan support. However, asymptomatic and mild cases also occur. Real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) testing of respiratory secretions is the mainstay for diagnosis, and samples from the lower respiratory tract have the greatest yield among seriously ill patients. There is no antiviral therapy of proven efficacy, and thus treatment remains largely supportive; potential vaccines are at an early developmental stage. There are multiple gaps in knowledge regarding the evolution and transmission of the virus, disease pathogenesis, treatment, and prospects for a vaccine. The ongoing occurrence of MERS in humans and the associated high mortality call for a con-tinued collaborative approach toward gaining a better understanding of the infection both in humans and in animals.",

            "text": "Seroepidemiologic studies have shown that antibodies to MERS-CoV are present in dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) throughout the Middle East and Africa, and studies indicate that MERS-CoV has circulated among dromedaries for at least three decades. Although MERS-CoV RNA has been detected in respiratory and other bodily secretions, particularly among juvenile dromedaries, infections in dromedaries may cause only mild upper respiratory manifestations. Investigations of animals in close proximity to reported cases in humans support the theory that dromedaries are the most likely source of animal-to-human transmission. 5 One case-control study showed that persons presenting with community-acquired MERS were 7 times as likely as controls to have had direct exposure to dromedaries during the preceding 2 weeks. 6 In addition, seroepidemiologic studies indicate that infection may be associated with occupational exposures to dromedaries. In one study conducted in Saudi Arabia, the rate of MERS-CoV seropositivity was 15 times as high in shepherds and 23 times as high in slaughterhouse workers as in the general population. 7 There is high sequence homology between the viruses from sporadic cases in humans and the implicated dromedaries. Although the routes of transmission remain unclear, they appear to include contact with infectious nasal or other bodily secretions and possibly the consumption of raw dromedary products (e.g., unpasteurized milk). Although dromedaryto-human transmission of MERS-CoV is now well recognized, direct exposure to dromedaries has been documented in only 40% of primary cases. 6 (For further details, see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.)",

During the 2014 MERS outbreak in Jeddah, 31% of the affected patients were health care personnel, and 88% of the affected patients who were not health care personnel had been admitted to or visited a health care facility within 14 days before symptom onset. 12 During 2015 and 2016, nosocomial outbreaks occurred in health care facilities in Jordan, 2 South Korea, 14 and Saudi Arabia. 16 In the Korean outbreak, which has been the largest outbreak outside the Middle East, transmission from a single infected person led to 186 cases and 36 deaths (case fatality rate, 19 .4%) across multiple health care facilities. 14 Over-crowded emergency departments, delays in diagnosis, and substandard practices for infection control have been identified as contributing factors in outbreaks that occur in health care settings. 12, 17 Available epidemiologic observations suggest that human-to-human transmission occurs primarily through close contact with a patient who has confirmed MERS, most likely through respiratory droplets. The risk of transmission appears to be greater during the performance of aerosolgenerating procedures without adequate personal protection or proper room ventilation. 18 In addition, contamination of environmental surfaces in patient rooms with MERS-CoV may result in transmission. 19, 20 One study isolated the infectious virus from air samples from MERS isolation wards, although this finding requires confirmation. 20 ",

The other patient, who survived, had high levels of the antiviral factors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and achieved rapid viral clearance. These antiviral factors are part of the innate antiviral response and are induced early in cells exposed to MERS-CoV. 54 The kinetics and durability of specific antibody responses to MERS-CoV are not fully characterized. Most patients produce serum IgG and secretory IgA within 2 weeks after the onset of illness. 39, 55, 56 However, the presence of such antibodies has not necessarily been followed by the elimination of MERS-CoV RNA from the lower respiratory tract, although data on titers of infectious virus at this site are lacking. 39 A decline in antibody levels over a period of several months has been observed in some convalescent patients. 57",

Mildly symptomatic cases can be manifested by low-grade fever, runny nose, sore throat, and muscle aches. Severe disease is characterized by progression to Panel A shows the structure, ecologic features, and transmission patterns of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The virion surface is covered with the spike glycoprotein, a 149 kDa glycoprotein that extends outward to create a crownlike appearance. The spike glycoprotein is critical for binding the host-cell receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), to initiate infection. Dromedary camels are infected with the virus and are believed to be the most likely source of animal-to-human transmission. Human-to-human transmission in household and health care settings has also occurred. Panel B shows the current understanding of key events in MERS pathogenesis, which is based on limited observations in patients and data from animal and cell-culture model systems. After intratracheal inoculation of MERS-CoV in nonhuman primates, the virus infects bronchial epithelial cells through DPP-4 before spreading to lung parenchymal cells, including type I and type II alveolar pneumocytes and endothelial cells. Viral entry is facilitated by another cell-surface protein, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell-adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5), which is also expressed in lung tissue. Inflammatory signaling molecules that are released by infected cells, alveolar macrophages, and neutrophils recruited to infected tissue have been detected in infected patients (black text) and animal models (blue text). A host antiviral type I and type III interferon response occurs, with systemic release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 3, 4 The virus may spread into the circulation, possibly from lung parenchyma or through infected endothelial cells. In humans, a high viral copy number has been detected in the lower respiratory tract, including tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, as well as in peripheral blood. In advanced disease, diffuse alveolar damage is seen, with extensive hemorrhagic edema and hyaline membrane deposition.

Multiple other licensed drugs have shown antiviral effects in vitro or have been proposed as host-directed therapeutics. 71 At present, none of these drugs can be recommended for the treatment of MERS outside the context of a clinical trial.

In addition to better characterizing the dynamics of MERS-CoV viral replication and their relationship to clinical manifestations, we need to assess innate and adaptive immune responses and possible host genetic susceptibility factors. Further autopsy studies are essential to inform our understanding of the disease pathology and the extent of extrapulmonary infection. There is a pressing need for evaluation of potential therapies and vaccines through collaborative and coordinated clinical trials conducted across affected regions. Lowering the risk to humans requires more effective control of animal-to-human transmission and, ideally, an effective dromedary vaccine. The lack of adequate studies of clinical characterization and disease pathogenesis, which is common among emerging infectious diseases, can be addressed in part by developing preapproved research protocols for rapid implementation in response to a new or emerging infection. 73, 74 The continued threat of MERS -including severe illness, periodic nosocomial outbreaks, and international spreadcalls for enhanced international collaboration to address these research priorities.",
