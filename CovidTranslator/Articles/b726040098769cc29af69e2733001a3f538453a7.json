However, in 1969 a reovirus-like agent (1, 2) and in 1972 a coronavirus (3, 4) were isolated from diarrheic calves. These viruses in gnotobiotic calves caused diarrhea typical of that seen in field cases. The recent association of a reovirus-like agent with acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis of infants and young children in many parts of the world (5-23) has stimulated interest in viral enteritis and, in particular, diarrhea caused by reovirus-like agents. In this paper, calf diarrhea caused by a reovirus-like agent will be reviewed.",

When the calf became depressed and diarrhea began, the villous epithelial cells were morphologically normal, but the cells contained a large quantity of viral antigen. It is postulated that the viral infection of the villous epithelial cells redirected cell function from absorption to virus production, and thus the digestive fluids and partially digested milk accumulated in the (Figure 6 ).

The epithelium over the distal three fourths of the villi in the lower part of the small intestine consisted of tall, columnar cells that had the nucleus at the base and large vacuoles in the cytoplasm. The lamina propria resembled that in the upper parts of the small intestine (Figure 2) (34). Small intestine from calves killed shortly after the onset of diarrhea had immunofluorescent epithelial cells on the tips of the villi in the upper part of the small intestine, over the distal half to one third of the villi in the middle part of the small intestine, and over the distal three fourths of the villi in the lower part of the small intestine (Figure 3). No immunofluorescence was observed in other organs. Histologically the upper small intestinal villous epithelium was composed of low columnar to cuboidal cells. Intestinal villi in the middle part of the small intestine had low columnar to cuboidal nonvacuolated epithelial cells. Tips of many villi were denuded, and there were free epithelial cells in the lumen. The villous lamina propria in sections of the upper and middle parts of the small intestine had an increase in reticulum-like cells. Lower small-intestinal villi resembled those in the control calf (34). Transmission electron microscopic examination of villous epithelium in sections of intestine adjacent to those which were immunofluorescent positive revealed large numbers of virions in the cytoplasm",

As the infection proceeded, there was an accelerated migration of the infected epithelial cells toward the tips of the villi; the cells were shed off the ends of the villi and replaced by cuboidal epithelial cells. Thus, calves killed shortly after the onset of diarrhea had immunofluorescent cells at the tips of the villi in the upper part of the small intestine and over most of the villi in the middle and lower parts of the small intestine. Calves killed later had immunofluorescent epithelial cells at the tips of the villi in the middle part of the small intestine and upper half of the villi in the lower part of the small intestine. About 4 hr after the onset of diarrhea all the immunofluorescent epithelial cells had been shed and replaced by cells with a cuboidal to squamous morphology. Calves which had no bacteria or had a nonpathogenic bacterial population during the viral infection recovered. If pathogenic bacteria, viz E. coli, were present, the altered epithelium and consequently altered intestinal function permitted an overgrowth of bacteria or bacteremia or both, followed by infection of other tissues. Large populations of bacteria in the intestinal lumen might also delay restoration of normal intestinal epithelium or even cause further injury to the epithelium.",
