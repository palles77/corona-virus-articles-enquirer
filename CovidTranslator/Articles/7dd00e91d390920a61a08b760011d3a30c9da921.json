Objective: We sought to prospectively assess airflow limitation and airway inflammation in children 4 to 6 years old with episodic virus-induced wheeze. Methods: Ninety-three children 4 to 6 years old with a history of mild, virus-induced episodes of wheeze who were able to perform acceptable fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) maneuvers and spirometry (with forced expiratory time > _0.5 seconds) were followed prospectively. Lung function and FENO values were measured every 6 weeks (baseline) within the first 48 hours of an acute wheezing episode (day 0) and 10 and 30 days later. Symptom scores and peak flow measurement were recorded daily. Results: Forty-three children experienced a wheezing episode. At day 0, FENO values were significantly increased, whereas forced expiratory volume at 0.5 seconds (FEV 0.5 ) significantly decreased compared with baseline (16 ppb [interquartile range {IQR}, 13-20 ppb] vs 9 ppb IQR, 7-11 ppb] and 0.84 L [IQR, 0.75-0.99 L] vs 0.99 L [IQR, 0.9-1.07 L], respectively; both P < .001). Airflow limitation at day 0 was reversible after bronchodilation. FEV 0.5 and FENO values were significantly associated with each other and with lower and upper respiratory tract symptoms when assessed longitudinally but not cross-sectionally at all time points independently of atopy. FENO and FEV 0.5 values returned to baseline levels within 10 days. Conclusions: Mild episodes of wheeze in preschoolers are characterized by enhanced airway inflammation, reversible airflow limitation, and asthma-related symptoms. FENO values increase significantly during the first 48 hours and return to personal baseline within 10 days from the initiation of the episode. Longitudinal follow-up suggests that symptoms, inflammation, and lung function correlate well in this phenotype of asthma. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2013;131:87-93.) ",

[2] [3] [4] The paucity of relevant evidence in the preschool age group might explain why the term ''asthma'' is frequently avoided and alternative approaches have been suggested. 5 Airway inflammation in wheezing infants and young children has not been comprehensively studied, mainly because of ethical limitations, although there is evidence of airway remodeling quite early in life. [6] [7] [8] Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) has received considerable attention as a noninvasive marker to assess airway inflammation, diagnose asthma in preschoolers, 9 or subdivide wheezers into various phenotypes. 10, 11 The majority of similar studies had a cross-sectional design; however, it is well established that FENO values can be influenced by current or recent viral infections 12, 13 and the use of oral or inhaled steroids.",

Moreover, in toddlers and older children with asthma-related symptoms, attempts to correlate inflammation, lung function, and symptoms have most frequently been inconclusive or negative. Nevertheless, these parameters have not been assessed longitudinally and in parallel. 16, 17 In this study we aimed to longitudinally evaluate and associate airway inflammation, airflow limitation, and symptoms during the course of the episodic, virus-induced wheezing disorder in steroid-naive children 4 to 6 years of age.",

This is not the case for nasal NO of subjects with disease limited to the upper respiratory tract, 37 suggesting that NO production is mainly associated with lower respiratory tract pathology. Moreover, it has been shown that rhinovirus is able to infect the bronchial epithelium and induce local inflammation, probably leading to asthma exacerbations in predisposed subjects. 38 Because airway NO is considered to play a pivotal role in antiviral defense, 39 FENO changes measured during these episodes conceivably reflect host-defense response to virus-induced airway inflammation. FENO measurements in our study returned to baseline values within 10 days, probably reflecting basal NO production rather than disease activity, as previously suggested in a more persistent population. 10 It is not clear whether virus-induced FENO increase can be downregulated by corticosteroids, but it seems unlikely because steroids, especially for rhinovirus infection, do not seem to modulate virus-induced interferon responses of the bronchial epithelium. 40 This might explain why, at least in this phenotype and age group, FENO does not seem to perform well in predicting inhaled corticosteroid response 41 and why corticosteroid therapy does not seem to have any disease-modifying effect on the progression of episodic wheezing. 42, 43 However, it is not known whether this acute, short-lasting inflammatory response, especially if it relapses multiple times after new respiratory tract viral infections, could predispose to or explain the transition from an unclear and uncertain asthmatic status to a definite chronic inflammatory process characterizing asthma.

All comparisons between consecutive prebronchodilation forced expiratory efforts (based on FETs) at different time points were not significantly different.

Statistically significant bronchodilation responses were observed even at baseline measurements, although with a small nonsignificant magnitude, which is consistent with another study. 11 Such an observation might imply a higher bronchomotor tone, which is in keeping with the prolonged postviral nonspecific hyperresponsiveness that has been shown in this type of wheezers. 45 Viral identification was similar to previously published data. 20 Analogously, peak upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms did not differ significantly with regard to atopy, a finding that has been described before in studies comparing healthy subjects and those with mild asthma. 46 Likewise, atopic status was not proved to play a significant role in FENO or prebronchodilation FEV 0.5 fluctuations.",

However, a weakness of the study is the lack of a healthy control group because of ethical considerations about salbutamol administration in healthy children. 47 However, we tried to overcome this by using accepted prediction equations for lung function testing, 14 normal FENO values, 24 and individual baseline measurements to compare and adjust for the outcomes of interest. In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates that inflammation, airway limitation, and symptoms are significantly associated in a longitudinal manner throughout an acute wheezing episode in 4-to 6-year-old children with virus-induced wheezing episodes. FENO values increase significantly during the first 48 hours of the episode and return to baseline ''personal normal'' values within 10 days. On the basis of the FET expected in this age group, FEV 0.5 seems to be the most appropriate parameter to assess airflow limitation and bronchodilation response both at baseline and during a wheezing episode. Both FENO and FEV 0.5 are also promising in correctly identifying and monitoring patients with (virus-induced) airway obstruction at the acute phase of a wheezing episode. Longitudinal assessment of time-dependent lung function and airway inflammation parameters appears to be superior to cross-sectional analyses, while at the same time it highlights the need for an individualized approach in patients with complex diseases, such as asthma.",
