            "text": "The flu alert level in Hong Kong was raised to the highest ''emergency'' level. 3 As of July 3, 2009, Hong Kong has detected 785 confirmed cases, and no death was reported. The first local nonimported community case was reported on June 10, 2009. 4 The government then changed from the containment strategy to the mitigation strategy. It suspended all primary schools and kindergartens from June 11, 2009 , until the next school year. Globally, as of February 28, 2010, there were at least 213 countries that have reported cases of H1N1 with at least 16,455 deaths. 5 In Hong Kong, as of March 3, 2010 , there were at least 34,174 cases that have been reported, with 73 death cases and 256 severe cases. 6 The Hong Kong government has been informing citizens that the A/H1N1 is transmitted in the same way as seasonal influenza. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which killed 299 people in Hong Kong, the population showed high levels of compliance with advice and adopted preventive behaviors such as wearing face masks and frequent hand washing as recommended by the Hong Kong government. Such practices were found effective in the control of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong 7 and continued to be practiced by a large proportion of the public even after the SARS epidemic subsided in Hong Kong. 8 Two reports investigated community responsiveness toward influenza A/H1N1 in Hong Kong 9 and in the United Kingdom 10 around the same time period (May 7-9 and May [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] 2009 ). With higher adoption rates of preventive measures, the public in Hong Kong seemed to have a relatively higher level of vigilance than that in the United Kingdom. For instance, the prevalence of avoiding crowded places and washing hands more frequently were, respectively, 54.9% and 73.6% in Hong Kong, as compared with 4.9% and 28.1% in the United Kingdom. 10 The UK study documented that the perceived efficacy of preventive measures and the perceived risk of contracting the disease were associated with adoption of recommended preventive behaviors. 10 This study investigated the prevalence of selfreported preventive behaviors in response to the influenza A/H1N1epidemic in Hong Kong, including wearing face masks regularly in public areas, wearing face masks in case of influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms, and frequent handwashing. Factors associated with these behaviors, including sociodemographic factors, cognitive factors (eg, perceived efficacy, perceived chance of having a large scale local outbreak), and affective factors (mental health distress) were investigated. It is hypothesized that such cognitive and affective factors are associated with adoption of preventive behaviors.",

It was only after community spread was confirmed on June 12, 2009, that the Hong Kong government changed to a mitigation strategy. As in all outbreaks of infectious disease, the control of the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic cannot rely only on governmental measures. Personal preventive behaviors are equally important, and individuals need to take responsibility for helping control emerging infectious diseases. This is especially important when the disease has spread widely in the community. Other countries such as the United States and United Kingdom relied less on initial containment strategies and more on individual preventive behaviors.",

This study has shown that around half of the respondents had washed their hands more than 10 times a day. Previous local studies conducted during and after the SARS period, as well as one study that was related to avian flu, which was conducted in 2007, also recorded very high frequencies of handwashing. 12 Moreover, the vast majority of our respondents (close to 90%) wore face masks in case of ILI symptoms. A comparable prevalence (92.4%) was obtained from a local study, which was conducted in 2007, investigating responses to an anticipated human-to-human H5N1 epidemic in Hong Kong. 13 The frequency of mask use in case of ILI symptoms therefore had in fact been increasing since the SARS and post-SARS period. 14 Frequent handwashing and use of face masks in case of ILI symptoms have been promoted by the Hong Kong government in the last few years as part of the preparedness against avian flu. There were posters and public health announcements on TV and other media, frequent broadcasts in all train stations, as well as leaflets handed out at the customs, educating people about the importance of washing hands frequently and properly. Similar messages were given during the SARS period, as well as for prevention of avian flu and seasonal flu. Such efforts have escalated since the influenza A/H1N1 outbreak occurred and are paying off: frequent handwashing seems to have become a habit of many Hong Kong people, and use of face masks in case of ILI symptoms seems to have become a norm in the Hong Kong community, worn to protect others from contracting influenza. It is known that subjective norms are important determinants of health behaviors. SARS and the series of public health threats resulting from avian flu and influenza A/H1N1 have had a sustained impact on personal hygiene and protective behaviors. Emerging infectious diseases therefore provide a window of opportunity for health education to improve personal hygiene.",

However, only 30.6% believed that frequent handwashing is very efficacious for prevention of influenza A/H1N1, although many believed that it is quite efficacious. The frequency of handwashing among the Hong Kong public can be increased further by informing citizens about the evidence base of the relationship between handwashing and prevention of emerging respiratory infectious diseases.",

As compared with the first month of the SARS period, 14 a much lower percentage of the Hong Kong general public has been wearing face masks regularly in public areas (69.7% vs 21.5%, respectively). This is understandable because SARS is more fatal than influenza A/H1N1. Our data showed that those who perceived that H1N1 had a high fatality were more likely to use face masks in public areas. Governments in different countries seem to be at variance on the advice they give on mask use in public areas, and further research is needed.",

During the study period, no severe cases and no deaths were reported. The hypotheses that the adoption of the 3 types of preventive behaviors was associated with cognitive factors such as perceived efficacy of the preventive measure, perceived chance of having a large scale outbreak, and perceived nonavailability of vaccine were largely supported by the results of this study. Similar factors were identified in the recently published UK study. 10 Moreover, similar factors were associated with adoption of different types of preventive behaviors protecting people from contracting SARS 12 or human avian flu. 13 The similarities are not unexpected because the aforementioned perception factors were derived from general health behavioral theories (such as the health belief model), which can be applied to understanding different types of preventive behaviors. It is hence important to keep track of changes in perceptions toward new emerging respiratory infectious diseases because modification of these perceptions may result in promotion of preventive behaviors. Consistent with the finding of the UK study, 10 our study showed that people with a higher level of mental distress because of A/H1N1 were more likely to adopt some of the 3 preventive measures. A Web-based study conducted in Norway reported the impact of fear and anxiety on people's decision making in the context of imminent influenza pandemic. 16 The result revealed that a certain level of fear and concern might lead to desirable preventive behaviors. One challenge for health policy makers and workers is to allay public anxiety without adversely impacting on positively protective behaviors particularly among single, male, and younger people who were less likely than others to use preventive measures to prevent influenza A/H1N1. In this regard, informing people about the mild nature of the virus in general but to remind people about its pandemic nature and risk for mutation may be helpful.",
