The most common reason for being vaccinated over the 5 years was the perception of influenza as a serious illness, which people want to avoid. The main reason for not getting vaccinated among those never previously vaccinated was feeling that they were unlikely to catch influenza. A recommendation by the family physician was the most encouraging factor for vaccination.",

Despite this knowledge and ongoing efforts by policy-makers, physicians and other healthcare providers, influenza vaccination rates in the five European countries surveyed remain limited, with the additional effect that manufacturing capacity may be too low for producing a sufficient amount of an appropriate monovalent vaccine when a pandemic occurs. 3 The WHO states that the risk of a new pandemic is at its highest level since the last pandemic in 1968. 4 This situation might influence the immunization coverage rates in the population.",

The main focus of this paper is on high-risk group coverage. A second objective is to understand the determinants for being or not being vaccinated, and to describe the populations' opinions regarding influenza and vaccination. In this context, we examine whether the threat of avian influenza had an impact on recent changes in vaccination coverage in the different countries.",

As healthcare workers are in contact with patients, it is critical for this group to be vaccinated in order to reduce transmission of the disease. Additionally, they play an important role in the communication and motivation of the public to get vaccinated. However, the vaccination rate among healthcare workers remained low compared to the other high-risk groups. A recent published literature review identified low coverage rates in this professional group to be especially a problem in Europe, 13 with vaccination rates between 12% and 25%. 5 Our observation of coverage rates increasing from 19% to 25% over the years is consistent with earlier findings.",

The selection process based on random dialing of telephone numbers has been shown to be of high quality. 19 In France, the questionnaire was a self-administered mail survey. In mailed questionnaires, there is a high risk of respondents omitting questions and of a low return rate. On the other hand, mailed questionnaires are an even more affordable option for large-scale surveys. 19 The limitations of the present data collection are described in greater detail in an earlier publication. 6 An increasing problem is the use of wireless telephones. In the USA people with landlines had a higher odds (1AE27) of being vaccinated than those with only access to wireless telephones. 20 If this is believed to be similar in Europe, we might have slightly overestimated the vaccination rate. The different methodological approach used in France may have affected the reliability of the comparison across countries.
