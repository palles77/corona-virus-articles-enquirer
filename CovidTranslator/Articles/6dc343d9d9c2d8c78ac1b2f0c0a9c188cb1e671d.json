            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) expresses its genes via a set of nested subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. Such discontinuous transcription is unique yet poorly understood for arterivirus. The utilization of transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) remains a puzzle, as many TRS-like sequences exist in viral genome, yet only six or seven sg mRNAs were transcribed in arterivirus infected cells. To investigate the transcriptional control of the porcine arterivirus, a recombinant PRRSV infectious cDNA clone pCPV expressing the capsid gene of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) between PRRSV ORF1b and ORF2a was developed. The rescued recombinant viruses contained a range of disparate deletions of the inserted PCV2 sequence, yet two stable recombinant viruses containing 41 and 275 nt of foreign sequences were generated upon plaque purification and serial passages. Further analysis of the sg RNA2 profile revealed that an array of novel sg RNA species was generated in cells infected with the recombinant virus. One group was formed by utilizing the inserted PCV2 sequence as TRS; another group was generated from cryptic TRS-like PRRSV sequences located 19, 37 and 97 nt immediately downstream of the PRRSV ORF2 AUG. These results demonstrated that (1) the recombinant virus from direct insertion of foreign sequences was genetically unstable, while two recombinant PRRSVs containing foreign sequence of 41 or 275 nt in length, respectively, became stable upon plaque purification and further serial passages; (2) PRRSV can utilize foreign TRS-like sequence as transcriptional promoter; (3) the insertion of foreign sequence provoked the generation of novel subgenomic RNAs utilizing cryptic TRS-like sequences that remain non-functional in native PRRSV.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a member of the family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . Similar to most Nidoviruses, PRRSV gene expression adopts a unique discontinuous transcription strategy for synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs (sg mRNAs), sharing the same genomic terminal untranslated regions (UTR) and the poly(A) tail with the viral genome (Pasternak et al., 2006; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . During this process, the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) is believed to play a vital role by mediating the discontinuous jumping of the nascent body RNA to the leader (Makino et al., 1991; Pasternak et al., 2001 Pasternak et al., , 2004 Sola et al., 2005; van Marle et al., 1999; Zuniga et al., 2004) , probably via a mechanism of similarity-assisted RNA recombination (Pasternak et al., 2006; Spaan et al., 1983 ) Several different models for discontinuous transcription have been proposed to illustrate the mechanism of such unique sg RNA synthesis (Pasternak et al., 2006; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . Sawicki and Sawicki (1995) first proposed that the discontinuous jumping happens during the synthesis of the negative-strand RNA. According to this minus-strand RNA extension model, the negativestrand RNA synthesis starts from the 3 end of the genomic RNA, and attenuates at the TRS body (TRS-B) site, where the transcriptase complex and nascent RNA jump to the leader TRS (TRS-L). More and more experimental data supported the minus-strand extension model, while key questions remain to be answered (den Boon et al., 1996; Hussain et al., 2005; Pasternak et al., 2006 Pasternak et al., , 2001 Sethna et al., 1989; van Marle et al., 1999) . For instance, what constitutes the attenuation signals during minus-strand RNA extension? How important a role that TRS-flanking sequences play in the transcriptional process? What is the mechanism of discontinuous jumping of the transcriptase-nascent RNA complex? Equine arterivirus (EAV) has been utilized as a model for molecular dissection of the arteriviral transcription, whereas little is known of porcine arteriviral RNA synthesis.",

Utilizing reverse genetic manipulation, these authors found that base-paring between the TRS-L and TRS-B was critical but not sufficient for mediating the discontinuous transcription of EAV subgenomic mRNA, for which local secondary structure seems also to play a significant role (Pasternak, 2003; Pasternak et al., 2001 Pasternak et al., , 2004 van Marle et al., 1999) . As a relatively newly emerging pathogen, PRRSV transcriptional mechanism has remained largely unknown. It is known that the PRRSV TRS-L is a hexa-nuleotide, UUAACC, which is conserved among different PRRSV genotypes (Meng et al., 1996; Meulenberg et al., 1993; Nelsen et al., 1999) . However, the TRS-B is diversified among different genotypes, PRRSV isolates, and sgmRNAs code for different proteins of the same virus strain. In addition, several noncanonical TRSs have been identified as leader-body junction site for sg mRNAs (Meng et al., 1996; Nelsen et al., 1999) . Among these diversified TRSs, however, it seems that an individual TRS may be preferentially employed for certain subgenomic RNA transcription (Nelsen et al., 1999) . In addition, several noncanonical TRS-like sequences exist in the arteriviral genome, implying that arteriviral transcription requires more than just the hexameric TRS sequences. Moreover, novel subgenomic transcripts were detected from cells infected with a recombinant EAV, MHV and TGEV (de Vries et al., 2001; Fischer et al., 1997; Sola et al., 2003) , possibly by activation of cryptic nonfunctional TRS sequence generated from inserted heterologous gene containing TRS-like sequence. These phenomena pose questions about what factors determine a functional TRS, and cautions have to be taken during the development of nidovirus as an expression vector for expression of the inserted gene.",

Sequence analysis reveals that novel subgenomic mRNAs were joined at aberrant junction sites of heterogeneous nucleotides. Sg RNA2.2, sg RNA2.3, sg RNA2.4 and sg RNA2.5, utilized PCV2 ORF2 sequence as TRS.

In comparison with the parental vORF12 producing just one sgm-RNA2 (Yu et al., 2009) , vCPV1 and vCPV2 produced one and three extra PCR bands, respectively (Fig. 3) , implying that novel subgenomic RNA species besides the canonical sg RNA2.1 were generated in the cells infected by the recombinant virus. The purified PCR bands were gel-purified, cloned, and nucleotide sequences were determined. At least 20 independent clones of each PCR products were sequenced. The leader-body junction site for sg RNA2.1 was the same as that of the vORF2 canonical sgmRNA2, while PCV2 sequence in sg RNA2.1 was partly deleted, and the deleted sequence was the same as in vCPV1 and vCPV2 genomic RNA, respectively (data not shown). The only difference between sg RNA2.1 of vCPV1 and vCPV2 was the size of the inserted PCV2 sequence. For vCPV2, sg RNA2.2, sg RNA2.3, sg RNA2.4 and sg RNA2.5 were formed by utilizing PCV2 sequence as TRS. Surprisingly, in the sequence for sgRNA2.3, there was clearly a 5 C residue (CCCCC) at positions 11-15, but this was written out as 4 C and a T residues (CCCCT) in the Leader template (Fig. 4A) . The sequences downstream of the leader-body fusion sites of sgRNA 2.3 (CCCCt) have one nucleotide difference (lowercase character) from the Leader template (CCCCC), but the fusion site sequences (TAACC) are identical to the core sequence of TRS-B. The sg RNA 2.4 and sg RNA2.5 were formed by utilizing the same TRS sequence, while the leader-body fusion sites were different from each other. The result indicated that the variant fusion site was downstream or upstream of the AAT sequence motif preceding the body TRS (TTAACC) for sg RNA 2.4 and sg RNA 2.5 (Fig. 4A) . We summarized the leader-body junction sites for these novel sg RNA2 located in pCPV (Fig. 4B) , and concluded that PRRSV can utilize TRS-like sequence from the inserted foreign gene for generation of novel subgenomic RNA species, and the leader-body junction sequences of all the novel sg RNA2 are from TRS-B.",

            "text": "In this study, for sg RNA2.3, contained additional, nontemplated nucleotides. The sequences downstream of the leader-body fusion sites of sg RNA 2.3 (CCCCu) have one nucleotide difference (lowercase character) from the Leader template (CCCCC). PRRSV is RNA virus, and the nucleotide mutation phenomenon usually happens, for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) can permit some nucleotide mismatch when PRRSV replicates and transcripts. So the one nucleotide difference may be caused by nucleotide mismatch during discontinuous transcription. Like SARS-CoV (Hussain et al., 2005) , for sgRNA2.5, the RNA polymerase can slide three nucleotides back on the leader template. And for sgRNA2.6, did use noncanonical transcriptional signals, and the CCUUU was used directly as a transcription-regulating signal, the leader-body junction site took place in the CCUUU region. Our results demonstrated that PRRSV can utilize foreign TRS-like sequences as TRS mediating the generation of the novel sg RNA species. de Vries et al. (2001) reported that EAV could utilize TRS-like foreign sequence in the inserted green fluorescent protein (GFP) as TRS to form the novel sg RNAs, which might be related to a sequence specificity of the GFP gene. The authors also suggested that the anomalous formation of subgenomic mRNAs is unnecessarily a general consequence of the insertion of foreign genetic information into the EAV genome. In our study, we identified a range of novel sg RNA formed by utilizing TRS-like sequence of PCV2 ORF2, implying that it is common property for coronavirus and arterivirus transcriptional machinery to utilize TRS-like foreign sequences for generation of novel sg RNA species. Like MHV, EAV and TGEV, the location of the functional TRS-like sequences in PCV2 ORF2 for PRRSV is uniformly located at the 3 end of the inserted foreign sequences (de Vries et al., 2001; Fischer et al., 1997; Sola et al., 2003) . This phenomenon may be related to transcription control scheme, in other word, the location of the novel TRSs from foreign sequences may be controlled by the length of transcription. Fischer et al. (1997) proposed that discontinuous transcription could sometimes depend solely on the structure of the viral genome which in turn would be determined by long-range RNA-RNA and/or RNA-protein interactions, and the primary sequence of the foreign sequence as TRS is usually TRS-like. So, for foreign sequence as TRS, its location, the second structure, and the primary sequence are the most important definitive factors.",

            "text": "Further development of PRRSV as an expression vector is of great interest. As the most genetically variable region in PRRSV genome, nsp2 coding sequence has been attempted as site for expressing gene of interest (GOI), but most of such recombinant viruses were proved to be unstable (Fang et al., 2008; Han et al., 2007) , or lost the biological activity of the GOI when the recombinant virus was genetically stable (Kim et al., 2007) . Calvert et al. (2002) inserted the GFP gene into the P129 infectious clone with an extra TRS element between ORF1b and ORF2a. Such \"green\" virus was proved to be genetically and phenotypically stable for at least 37 passages. Using the same strategy, Pei et al. (2009) inserted the PCV2 capsid gene with a TRS sequence for the downstream PRRSV ORF2, the recombinant PRRSV-PCV2 virus was stable in both in vitro and in vivo host. Thus, a synthetic TRS with flanking sequences was introduced to GP2 and E protein normally expressed, and the recombinant viruses are stable (Calvert et al., 2002; Pei et al., 2009) . In our study, we directly inserted of PCV2 capsid gene into intergenic region between ORF1 and 2 without an additional TRS. de Vries et al. (2001) reported that EAV could utilize TRS-like foreign sequence in the green fluorescent protein (GFP) inserted to form a novel sg RNA, and these novel sg RNA could code for extended M protein. Our results showed that multiple functional leader-tobody junction sites were located within the PCV2 ORF2 gene, such as TRS-B2.2-2.5. It is believed that arteriviral mRNA translation utilizes a leaky scanning scheme, during which the most 5 proximal AUG downstream of the leader is probably utilized as the initiation codon of the mRNA. The arteriviral sgmRNA2-coded GP2 and E proteins are vital for virus viability Lee and Yoo, 2006) . We obtained viable recombinant PRRSV containing foreign sequence insertion up to 275 nt, indicating that the GP2 and E proteins were expressed from one or more of the sg RNA2 molecules. The sg RNA2.1, utilizing the canonical TRS-B2.1, contained multiple start and stop codons upstream of the authentic initiator AUGs for both ORF2a and ORF2b, making it as unlikely mRNAs coding for the GP2 and E. For sg RNA2.2, the most 5 proximal AUG is outframe for PRRSV GP2. For sg RNA2.3, the first AUG is in-frame for GP2, however, if sg RNA2.3 can code for an extended GP2, the ribosomes have to read through the termination signals of PCV2 capsid gene as the recombinant EAV coded for extended M protein (de Vries et al., 2001) . For sg RNA2.4 and sg RNA2.5, the first AUG is just the start code of GP2. So sg RNA2.4 and sg RNA2.5 may code for the intact GP2 and E protein. So, in our study, it is possible for PRRSV GP2 and E protein to be normally expressed. To be disappointed, the recombinant PRRSV were unstable, in which a chunk of inserted gene was deleted. The instability of the recombinant PRRSV could be caused by disruption of PRRSV ORF2 transcription. Upon insertion of PCV2 ORF2 to the region, TRS2.1 drove transcription of the PCV2 ORF2 gene instead of ORFs 2a and 2b. E protein has been shown to be essential for EAV and PRRSV (Lee and Yoo, 2006) . Accordingly, the recombinant PRRSV must make TRS-like sequence active to form the novel sg RNAs for expressing GP2 and E protein by deleting the foreign sequences. However, for EAV, although an expression cassette consisting of the GFP gene flanking EAV-specific transcription-regulating sequences at its 3 end was constructed, the recombinant EAV was not genetically stable (de Vries et al., 2001) . Besides the reason referred to in the paper, we consider that the stability of recombinant virus is related to the location of foreign sequence inserted into genome and the background of genome (Calvert et al., 2002; Pei et al., 2009) .",

(A) Identification of the leader-body junction sequence for novel subgenomic RNAs. The PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into pGEM-T vector and at least 10 independent clones for each band were sequenced. Sequence analysis reveals that novel subgenomic mRNAs were joined at aberrant junction sites of heterogeneous nucleotides. Sg RNA2.2, sg RNA2.3, sg RNA2.4 and sg RNA2.5, utilized PCV2 ORF2 sequence as TRS. Sg RNA2.6, sg RNA2.7 and sg RNA2.8 utilized a TRS-like sequence located at 19, 37 and 97 nt immediately downstream of the PRRSV ORF2 start codon, respectively. Note that, Sg RNA 2.4 and sg RNA2.5 were formed by utilizing the same TRS sequence, while the leader-body fusion sites were different from each other. The variant fusion site is downsream or upstream of the AAT sequence motif, which is preceding the body TRS (TTAACC) for sg RNA 2.4 and sg RNA 2.5. The upper strand in the alignments represented the TRS-B region of PCV2 ORF2 or PRRSV ORF2 genomic sequence, and the lower strand represents PRRSV genomic leader sequence. Arrowheads indicated the jumping direction of leader-body. The nucleotides in colored letter were derived directly from the sequence profiles. The leader-body junction sequences were indicated by straight and dash line. The sequences of TRS-B were shaded. (B) Identification of the Leader-Body junction sites for novel subgenomic RNAs.
