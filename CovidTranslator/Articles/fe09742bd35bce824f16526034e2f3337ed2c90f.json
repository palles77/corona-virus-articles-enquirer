In the last few decades, a novel retrovirus (HIV) has emerged from the jungles of Africa to infect and kill millions of individuals from all continents. Less dramatically, newly described microbes have been linked to human diseases since 1980 ( Figure 1 ). Are there other microbial pathogens that are significant causes of human disease and await discovery? There are many diseases for which a microbial aetiology is suspected ( Figure 2 ). The hypothesis that a disease has an infectious cause is supported by:",

The association between Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease was not made until recently, despite our ability to cultivate this bacterium in the laboratory and to see it under the microscope in gastric biopsies. \u2022 Another reason is failure of conventional microbial detection technologies. Studies of bacterial biodiversity in various envi- ronmental and human niches have shown that cultivation can detect only a fraction of the bacteria identified using nucleic acid sequences. Microbes may exist in viable but non-culturable states, or as sessile members of biofilm communities in which individual cells may be difficult to cultivate.
