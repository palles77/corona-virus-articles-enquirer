            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the causative agents of a number of important human and veterinary diseases including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), SARS-CoV (Zhong et al. 2003). Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) has served as an excellent model system for studying the biology of the closely-related SARS-CoV. CoVs are highly recombinogenic and are capable of crossing species barriers and infecting \"non-native\" hosts. Additionally, a number of CoVs have been identified in bats, which are important reservoir hosts for zoonotic viruses (Quan et al. 2010 ). CoVs harbor a very large (\u224830 kb), positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome. This genome serves as a template for replication, transcription (of sub-genomic mRNAs which encode structural and accessory proteins), and translation (of nsps). The nsps are translated from the first two-thirds of the genome and are then proteolytically processed into 16 mature proteins, which are components of the viral replicase. Nsp3 is the largest of all CoV nsps and is by far the best structurally characterized of any CoV nsp. In SARS-CoV, nsp3 contains seven domains denoted nsp3a through nsp3g sequentially from the N-terminus. The three-dimensional structures of all of the SARS-CoV soluble domains are now available (Johnson et al. 2010) .",

The plasmid pnsp3a was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS competent cells and plated on LB agar plates containing 100 mg/L ampicillin and 34 mg/L chloramphenicol. Uniformly 15 N, 13 C-labeled proteins were expressed in sterile minimal media containing 1X M9 salts (6 g/L Na 2 HPO 4 , 3 g/L KH 2 PO 4 , 0.5 g/L NaCl, pH 7.4), 2 mM MgSO 4 , 0.1 mM CaCl 2 , 0.25 mg/L thiamine hydrochloride, 100 mg/L ampicillin, 2.5 g/L 13 C glucose and 1 g/L 15 NH 4 Cl. A single colony from the transformation plate was used to inoculate a 200 mL M9 culture containing 100 mg/L ampicillin and grown overnight at 25 \u00b0C with shaking. The starter culture was used to inoculate 6 \u00d7 1L LB (100 mg/L ampicillin) cultures such that the 1L cultures would have an initial OD 600 of 0.1. Large cultures were grown at 37 \u00b0C with shaking until the OD 600 reached 0.6-0.8 at which time expression was induced with the addition of 500 \u03bcM IPTG. Cells were grown at 25 \u00b0C for an additional 16 h prior to harvesting by centrifugation at low speed. Cell pellets were frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, thawed, and resuspended in 200 mL lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 g protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and 0.15% (v/v) PEI (polyethyleneimine) was added dropwise to the supernatant with stirring at 4 \u00b0C to precipitate nucleic acids. After stirring for 2 h, the solution was clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was then subjected to (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 precipitation (50% then 80% saturation) and the 80% pellet was resuspended in 30 mL of Buffer A (25 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, pH 8.0) and extensively dialyzed against Buffer B (25 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, pH 8.0). The sample was then subjected to purification using a Q-sepharose anion exchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with Buffer B. The dialyzed sample was loaded onto the column and eluted with a linear gradient from 100 mM NaCl to 400 mM NaCl over 24 column volumes. Fractions containing purified nsp3a were pooled and concentrated to a volume of less than 5 mL. The sample was then subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer C (50 mM KP i 100 mM KCl, 5 mM TCEP, pH 6.0). The purity of all final products was estimated to be > 95% pure by inspection of Coomassie-stained 18% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the integrity verified by ESI-MS.",

Both outputs are in good general agreement and collectively reveal that MHV nsp3a harbors four \u03b2-strands and three \u03b1-helices arranged from the N-terminus as \u03b21-\u03b11-\u03b22-\u03b12-\u03b13-\u03b23-\u03b24. The amide group of L27 is significantly downfield shifted and is located in a region of the molecule that is predicted as random coil by both TALOS+ and CSI. This downfield shift could be reporting residual \u03b2-strand character here but more likely reflects the influence of a strong ring current effect induced by the side chain of nearby F31 in the N-terminal region of the \u03b11 helix immediately following. 1 H, 15 N HSQC spectrum of MHV nsp3a.
