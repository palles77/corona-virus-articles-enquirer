Based on the historical data collected for COVID-19 spreading in 367 cities in China and the set of parameters of the augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model obtained for each city, a set of profile codes representing a variety of transmission mechanisms and contact topologies is formed. By comparing the data of an early outbreak of a given population with the complete set of historical profiles, the best fit profiles are selected and the corresponding sets of profile codes are used for prediction of the future progression of the epidemic in that population. Application of the method to the data collected for South Korea, Italy and Iran shows that peaks of infection cases are expected to occur before the end of March 2020, and that the percentage of population infected in each city will be less than 0.01%, 0.05% and 0.02%, for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively.",

With no travel restriction in place due to the low level of vigilance or unawareness of the disease during the early phase of the outbreak, the spreading of the disease had gone almost unobstructed. Travel restriction began to be implemented throughout China since January 24, 2020, which has proven to be effective in curbing the spread of the virus.

For Italy, we predict that Lombardi and Amelia Romagna would eventually have about 4,784 and 1,555 infected cases (i.e., 0.399% and 0.162 % of region's population), respectively, and the number of people eventually infected in other cities in Italy would be below 700 (<0.05% of city population). Moreover, Iran would have around 14,450 infected individuals, i.e., 0.018% of its population, of which around 2,498 and 1,698 will be expected in Tehran and Zanjan (i.e., 0.39% and 0.2% of the city's population). In addition, the number of people infected in most other cities would be fewer than 1,000 (<0.1% of the city's population). From the progression trends of the epidemic these three countries, provided control measures continue to be in place, the epidemic would come under control before the end of April 2020.",

            "text": "The spreading of the 2019 New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) has evolved from a contagion originally confined within Wuhan, China, in December 2019, rapidly to a global contagion, which has spread to 87 countries within two months. The numbers of confirmed infection cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran have surged in the last two weeks, reaching 7,313, 5,883 and 5,823, respectively, on March 8, 2020. The global fatality rate, however, remains below 3%. In this study, we build on the result of our previous work [4] that establishes a library of parameters of an augmented SEIR model, corresponding to the historic spreading profiles of 367 cities in China. This library forms a set of profile codes that cover a variety of possible epidemic progression profiles. By comparing the early incomplete data of epidemic progression collected for a specific population with the historic profiles, we select a few candidate profiles from the historic archive using a nonlinear optimization procedure. The corresponding profile codes of the selected historic progression profiles can then be used to produce estimates of the future progression for that specific population. We apply this method to predict the spreading of COVID-19 in South Korea, Italy and Iran. Results show that the three countries will soon see infection peaks in most cities in the coming 2 to 3 weeks, with South Korea's cases reaching their peaks slightly earlier than the others. The percentage of population eventually infected will be less than 0.3%, 0.05% and 0.02% for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively. The epidemic is expected to end before June 2020, and depending on the effectiveness of treatment, particular cities may see full recovery or zero infection sooner or later than others. It is worth noting that the epidemic progression in South Korean cities are found to be more rapid than typical, implying that the authorities might have taken effective measures to control the spread. The predicted progressions for Italy and Iran, on the other hand, are found to display profiles that are typical of those in the historical archive, and unless more stringent measures are taken, the peaks and subsequent decline of the infection numbers will unlikely come sooner or more rapidly than the predicted trajectories. Finally, we should stress that the proposed data-driven coding method is applicable to predicting epidemic progression in any given population and the accuracy of prediction will depend on the adequacy of the available data in allowing a reliable match to be identified from the historical archive.",

Statistics of the percentage of population eventually infected and the number of individuals eventually infected are shown in Figures 8 (d) to (i). Our key findings are summarized as follows: 5 1. The number of infected individuals in South Korea, Italy and Iran is expected to continue to increase until mid March 2020. While South Korea will see peaks in most of the cities between March 8, 2020 and March 16, 2020, Italy and Iran are expected to see peaks before the end of March, 2020, as shown in the distributions of the peak times given in Figures 8 (a) to (c",

For South Korea, our results show that Daegu and Seoul are the two hardest hit cities, with 7,619 \u00b12,096 and 1,287 \u00b1197 people eventually infected, accounting for 0.306% \u00b10.084% and 0.062% \u00b10.009% of the city's population. In other cities in South Korea, the number of infected people will be less than 300, i.e., below 0.01% of the population. 3. For Italy, our results show that Lombardi and Amelia Romagna will have the highest number of cases, with 4,784 \u00b1788 and 1,555 \u00b1360 people eventually infected, accounting for 0.399% \u00b10.066% and 0.162% \u00b10.129% of the region's population. In other Italian cities or regions, the number of infected people will be below 700, which is less than 0.05% of the population. 4. For Iran, we expect Tehran and Zanjan to be most severely affected, reaching 2,498 \u00b1566 (0.39% \u00b10.02%) and 1,695 \u00b192 (0.2% \u00b10.07%) cases eventually, respectively.",
