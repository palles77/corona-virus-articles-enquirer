The plan is a coordination framework that identifies key actors, their roles and responsibilities. These plans are supplemented with operational guidelines with specific actions that need to be conducted along the continuum of a legal death enquiry/investigation. \u2022 The MFRP should describe a multi-agency communication and coordination strategy for all actors involved in the process.
