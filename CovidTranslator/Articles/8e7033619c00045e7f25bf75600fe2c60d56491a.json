Although there is significant overlap between the skin signs of systemic disease in children and adults, there are several conditions in which important distinctions exist in the characteristic clinical presentation. Our author, Dr. Amy Gilliam, has special experience and expertise in pediatric rheumatologic disorders. In an interesting case-based format, Dr. Gilliam provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical findings in several rheumatologic conditions that are more specific to children in contrast to their adult counterparts. Furthermore, she provides an update on diagnosis and management of several uniquely pediatric disorders including neonatal lupus erythematosis, childhood vasculitides (Kawasaki disease, Henoch Schonlein Purpura, acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy) and the more recently described neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder (NOMID) syndrome. This article provides clinically relevant information that may aid the clinician in the accurate and prompt recognition of these challenging diseases. Timely diagnosis will hopefully result in more effective therapy as well as prevention of disease-related complications that may ultimately improve the outcomes in these complex patients.",

Early recognition of subtle cutaneous signs of systemic illness in childhood can help to prevent adverse outcomes through earlier initiation of appropriate treatment. Although adults and children are affected by many of the same systemic conditions, there are some dermatologic features of these illnesses that are unique to the pediatric population. In this review, several cases of children presenting with cutaneous features of systemic disease will be discussed.",

However, when the diagnosis of JDM is unclear, such as in the case of possible mixed connective tissue disease, muscle biopsy is considered the ''gold standard'' confirmatory test. Cutaneous histopathology is not included in the diagnostic criteria for JDM because it is rather nonspecific and can resemble that seen in lupus erythematosus, as it is characterized by a vacuolar interface dermatitis. However, a skin biopsy may be useful in helping to exclude other diagnostic possibilities such as atopic or contact dermatitis, psoriasis, and drug eruptions.",

An immune-mediated vasculitis appears to be a key event in JDM pathogenesis. One hypothesis suggests that chimerism plays an important role in the pathogenesis in that maternally derived T cells, which normally persist in a state of tolerance or anergy, are activated leading to an antihost inflammatory response such as is seen in the setting of graft-versus-host disease [3] . Although familial incidence of dermatomyositis is exceedingly rare, specific susceptibility alleles have been identified, including the HLA-DQA1*0501 allele, which is linked to persistent fetal microchimerism, and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa)-308A locus, which is associated with a more chronic disease course and various complications such as calcinosis cutis, partial lipodystrophy, insulin-resistant diabetes, and hyperlipidemia [2] .",

Sometimes, with involvement of the bridge of the nose and malar cheeks, the skin changes may resemble the malar rash of systemic lupus erythematosus. Gottron's papules/sign (see Fig. 1B ), also specific to dermatomyositis in both adults and children, is characterized by scaly, violaceous papules or plaques, most commonly located on the interphalangeal joints but also seen over other bony prominences such as the metacarpals, elbows, knees, and malleoli. These cutaneous lesions are often mistakenly diagnosed as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis, as the clinical differential diagnosis of Gottron's papules includes these conditions. In some cases, Gottron's papules can present with only subtle erythema in these locations, making a clinical diagnosis more difficult. Also, both adults and children with dermatomyositis often demonstrate evidence of photosensitivity and commonly have the ''V-sign'' rash, which is characterized by erythema, scaling, and poikiloderma on the upper chest and face (see Fig. 1C ). When this photosensitive eruption involves the upper back as well, it is termed the ''shawl sign. '' In JDM, however, these hallmark findings of dermatomyositis are not often seen on initial presentation. As Peloro and colleagues [4] reported, based on a 30-year experience, the majority of JDM patients present with a nonspecific extremity rash and periungual erythema. Also, approximately one third of children with JDM were noted to have pruritus at the time of presentation. This is an often underrecognized symptom that can be a significant problem for both adults and children with dermatomyositis.",

This cutaneous calcification presents as painful, hard nodules that can extrude spontaneously through the skin, creating a nidus for infection (Fig. 2) . It occurs at sites of trauma (elbows, knees, and buttocks), often beginning 1 to 2 years after disease onset, and can be demonstrated through the use of routine imaging studies, including plain films, CT, and MRI scans. Calcinosis cutis is thought to be related to long-term, uncontrolled inflammation because children who are treated aggressively and early in the disease course are less likely to develop soft tissue calcification [8] . The link between calcification and inflammation has been further defined as both macrophages and certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1b, and TNF-a, have been identified in the fluid of a calcium deposit of a patient with JDM [9] . One theory as to why children develop calcification while adults do not relates to the fact that there is often a significant delay in making the diagnosis of JDM in children as compared to adults, in which the diagnosis is made more rapidly.",

Prior to the introduction of corticosteroids, the mortality rate of JDM was over 30%, while it is currently reported to be less than 2% to 3%. More recently, steroid-sparing agents have been utilized in an attempt to avoid the side effects associated with longterm steroid therapy. Methotrexate has become the steroid-sparing agent of choice due to the fact that pediatric rheumatologists have gained extensive clinical experience with this agent in the treatment of juvenile arthritis and have found low-dose therapy to be safe and effective [15] . The typical treatment regimen for JDM consists of early intervention with high-dose corticosteroids concurrent with the introduction of a steroid-sparing agent such as methotrexate or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Subsequently, steroids are tapered over weeks to months to the minimum dosage required for adequate disease control or until the disease remits on its own. At times, the skin disease remains a problem despite achievement of good control of the myositis. Also, there are well-described cases of amyopathic dermatomyositis occurring in childhood as well as in adulthood [16] . These patients exhibit the classic cutaneous findings of dermatomyositis in the absence of clinical, laboratory, or histologic evidence of myositis. For cases with recalcitrant skin disease and/or amyopathic dermatomyositis, therapeutic measures such as oral hydroxychloroquine, topical steroids/immunomodulators, and avid sun protection are often employed.",

These skin changes are more pronounced when she is cold but do not fade completely when she warms up. She has no other complaints, including joint pain, unexplained fever, or other skin alterations. This case illustrates an example of livedo reticularis (LR) in a young girl. LR is a skin vasculopathy represented by violaceous, reticulate, net-like patterns in the skin most often located on the legs, but that can also affect the upper trunk and arms. True or ''fixed'' LR, also called ''livedo racemosa,'' does not change or disappear with changes in ambient temperature, and LR can be either primary or secondary in nature. Primary or idiopathic LR is a diagnosis of exclusion, while secondary LR is often related to hypercoaguable states and autoimmune conditions. Therefore, the presence of LR, especially when extensive such as in this case, should alert the clinician to investigate for associated disease because the pathogenesis may be related to vaso-occlusive microthrombotic vascular events or inflammatory phenomena, either immune complex mediated or that which is associated with antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody.",

Therefore, a diagnosis of APS requires the presence of both clinical and laboratory criteria. However, these criteria are often not applicable to children because the pediatric population does not experience fetal loss and rarely develops vascular thrombosis. Therefore, other features, such as a history of migraines and/or seizures, should be considered suggestive of this condition in childhood if other features of APS are present based on history, laboratory evaluation, and physical examination. Livedo is the primary cutaneous manifestation of APS and occurs in 25% of patients [17] . The presence of LR in the setting of APS is highly associated with arterial thrombotic events, manifested by migraines, seizures, cardiac valve thickening and vegetations, and cerebral or ocular ischemic arterial events [17, 18] . Other hypercoaguable conditions that can present with LR include protein C and S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, cold agglutininemia, cryoglobulinemia, cryofibrinogenemia, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia.",

Extracutaneous complications of juvenile-onset SLE include renal, cardiac, hematologic, neuropsychiatric, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal problems. Therefore, treatment can vary depending on the extent and nature of visceral involvement. Mild disease can be managed with sun protection/sun avoidance, high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and topical steroids/immunomodulators for treatment of skin lesions.

Steroid-sparing agents used in the setting of childhood SLE include azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine. Intravenous cyclophosphamide has been the standard of care for the treatment of lupus glomerulonephritis in the past. However, its use is limited by potentially toxic effects, including bone marrow suppression, hemorrhagic cystitis, opportunistic infections, malignancy, and gonadal toxicity. Clearly, the possibility of premature gonadal failure is likely to be of much greater concern when treating pediatric versus adult patients, although this is not absolute. Recently, Ginzler and colleaguers [25] demonstrated that induction therapy with mycophenolate mofetil was superior to intravenous cyclophosphamide in inducing complete remission of lupus nephritis in 140 adult patients. More studies are needed as the experience with mycophenolate mofetil in childhood is currently limited to small case series for this indication [26, 27] . However, this data holds promise for the future availability of safer immunosuppressive therapies for children with SLE.",

This is not a purulent conjunctivitis, as there is no tearing or exudate, but is simply cytokine mediated vessel dilatation. A slit lamp examination may reveal anterior uveitis. Cracked, red lips ( Fig. 9 ) are another common feature as is the ''strawberry tongue,'' which is due to the sloughing of the filiform papillae and persistence of the fungiform papillae giving the ''strawberry'' appearance. Unilateral lymphadenopathy is seen in only a minority of patients, and is a much less specific finding than the other findings discussed previously, such as the perineal desquamation. The etiology of KD is unknown. It is hypothesized that a yet unidentified infectious agent triggers an inappropriate immune response in a genetically susceptible individual. An infectious trigger is suspected due to the fact that the epidemiology of KD is associated with discrete seasonal peaks, geographic clustering, and clinical features suggestive of infection, such as the presence of fever, rash, and adenitis, as well as the fact that the age group affected reflects that in which childhood infections typically occur (ages 6 months to 4 years). Yet, a single infectious agent has not been reliably linked with onset of KD. Recent studies have suggested the possibility that a novel human coronavirus, the ''New Haven coronavirus,'' is the trigger [45] . However, this hypothesis has since been refuted. Shimizu and colleagues [46] assessed for the presence of this virus in the respiratory tracts of a geographically and ethnically diverse population of patients. They found that only 2% (1 of 48 patients) with acute KD had evidence of infection with the human coronavirus.",

Traditionally, to meet criteria for diagnosis, a child was required to have a fever for at least 5 days. Now, because clinicians are making the diagnosis of KD more rapidly, cases with 4 or even fewer febrile days shortened by early IVIG therapy have been proposed to be equivalent to cases with 5 or more febrile days. The criteria have also been revised, keeping in mind that the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy is less common than the other clinical findings are (seen in only half of cases.) Therefore, cervical lymphadenopathy has been placed further down on the list, reflecting its lower frequency [48] . ''Incomplete'' KD should be used to describe patients with fever and at least two of the clinical criteria for KD as well as laboratory data reflecting systemic inflammation such as elevated white blood cell count, ESR, C-reactive protein, and low hemoglobin [49] . Incomplete disease is particularly problematic because it is poorly recognized, causing patients to be at risk for coronary complications. This atypical presentation is more common in young infants less than 3 months of age and older children.",

More recently, Burns and colleagues [55] reported promising results with the use of infliximab for a series of patients with refractory KD who failed to become afebrile with conventional therapy.

CIAS1 is the gene that encodes cryopyrin, which is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and inflammation. Given that cryopyrin is specifically involved in the processing of IL-1b, the therapy for NOMID that has been associated with the greatest success is anakinra, which is an IL-1 receptor antagonist. NOMID patients who have been treated with anakinra have been reported to demonstrate rapid improvement in clinical symptoms and laboratory markers of inflammation [64] .

Research using imaging modalities has explored the use of 13-mH ultrasound, which detects the thickness of skin lesions but is more useful in making the diagnosis of localized scleroderma rather than monitoring for disease activity [73] . Infared thermography appears to be quite promising for this purpose, in that it can successfully detect evidence of disease activity.

UV light improves skin lesions for both localized and systemic scleroderma patients through several mechanisms. For one, UV upregulates matrix metalloproteinases and collagenase, which promote collagen breakdown. UV also causes depletion of skin-infiltrating T-lymphocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokines. UVA1 is the preferred wavelength for treatment of scleroderma, and has been demonstrated in Europe to be quite efficacious in softening skin lesions [76, 77] . This is because, compared to other wavelengths, it penetrates more deeply into the dermis and is less well absorbed by melanin [78] . However, this therapy is not widely available in the United States, and therefore, providers must rely on psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) or UVB, which are less successful in inducing collagenase activity. Encouraging results were reported in a recent study, which demonstrated that although medium-dose UVA1 was significantly more effective in softening skin lesions of localized scleroderma, narrow-band UVB (NB UVB) produced remarkable improvement in skin lesions as well [79] . The fact that NB UVB, like UVA1, penetrates more deeply into the dermis than other wavelengths (such as broadband UVB) further explains the efficacy of this more widely available treatment option for localized scleroderma.",
