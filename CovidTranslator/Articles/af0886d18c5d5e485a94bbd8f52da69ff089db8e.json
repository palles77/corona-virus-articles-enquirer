Key parameters affecting the amplification of full antibody repertoires includes the availability of primers that can amplify as many V genes as possible; however the strategy used to design these primers and programs used to make the necessary alignments have not been well studied and clearly detailed in the literature. Here, we present a set of primers computationally designed by iCODEHOP based on a database of human germline Ig sequences. We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols that would recognize the V H genes from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We identified the most highly conserved region in framework 1 and framework 4 of the Ig cDNA, and designed a set of degenerated 5 0 primers. The V H genes were successfully amplified by RT-PCR. This new primer has facilitated the creation of more diverse V H libraries than has been previously possible. Moreover, iCODEHOP improved the primer design efficiency and was found useful both for cloning unknown genes in gene families and for building V H gene libraries.",

A recent development in immunodiagnosis of human disease has been the introduction of molecular recombination techniques leading to the emergence of new analytic approaches based on the essential properties of the single-chain variable fragment (ScFv) (Hafner et al. 2000) , or the selection of a relevant recombinant antibody with the use of ScFv phage-display libraries (McCafferty et al. 1990; Clackson et al. 1991; Tanaka and Rabbitts 2009; Pansri et al. 2009 ) and the production of the recombinant antibodies using different expression systems (Pollock et al. 1999; Yang et al. 2005) .

The primers reported in these studies were designed based on the human Ig sequence data available at the time these primers were devised. This raises the question whether these primers still cover all known genes adequately. One research group has attempted to overcome the shortcomings of this earlier research by using a set of different V-gene specific primers in combination with Ig-class specific reverse primers (Lim et al. 2010) .

Germline V, D, and J gene sequences encoding V H chains, were retrieved from the IMGT information system. Furthermore, the engineering of synthetic antibodies has become an important methodology for generating diagnostic and therapeutic molecules, such as those used by phage display or ribosome display. A good coverage of V genes is desirable when generating antibody libraries for phage display to ensure the retrieval of diverse set of binding antibodies during selection. Because the 400 bp length of an antibody V gene has approximately 10 8 variations, amplifying a Fv is more complicated than an unknown gene in other gene families. To amplify the V H genes of Ig cDNAs from PBMCs, we first had to design primers of relatively low degeneracy to realize the natural benefits of a degenerate primer to cover every family sequence and minimize the number of primers. To accomplish this, we focused on selecting conserved regions of the V genes and the degeneracy of primers.",

            "text": "Although there are several other publicly available tools for designing degenerate primers, iCODEHOP is the only tool that contributes to designing primers with the consensus-degenerate hybrid format. It is also one of only a few programs that design primers from amino acid multiple alignments. Several existing systems, including SCPrimer , Amplicon (Jarman 2004) , and HY-DEN (Linhart and Shamir 2005) design degenerate primers entirely from nucleic acid multiple alignments. This approach is profitable when nucleotide information is available and avoids the problem of back-translating amino acid sequences. However, it is sometimes impossible to recognize conserved regions among the many nucleotide sequences that can encode a protein family of interest, even when conservation is visible at the amino acid level. To the best of our knowledge, GeneFisher (Giegerich et al. 1996; Lamprecht et al. 2008 ) is the only other publicly available web application besides iCODEHOP that both designs Fig. 2 PCR amplification of V gene families from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. PCR products obtained for individual VH gene families using primers described in Table 1 , were resolved on agarose gels. The name of the forward primer is indicated. The expected size (*350 bp) of the PCR products were obtained for 7 V H gene families. M molecular weight marker (2,000, 1,000, 750, 500, and 250 bp) degenerate primers from amino acid sequences and generates degenerate primers that have been verified in laboratory experiments. GeneFisher2 appears to allow degenerate positions at any position along the primers it produces. In contrast, the CODEHOPs created by iCODEHOP have degenerate positions only within 11-12 bases at their 3 0 end. The remaining positions of a CODEHOP are derived from the input amino acid multiple alignment by determining the most common codons of the consensus amino acids created from the alignment. As discussed above, we selected iCODEHOP to design degenerate primers for Ig V H genes. The iCODEHOP program, which can be employed to design degenerate primers, also has shortcomings. Under certain conditions, iCODEHOP is incapable of designing primers for a particular protein multiple alignment because conservation is too poor among the selected sequences for the program to detect primers that satisfy degeneracy and clamp length constraints. We used two methods of alignment to find the more conserved region. The first method was to use all human Ig gene sequences in all families defined by IMGT aligned as one group. However, the conserved region was not found, so we abandoned this alignment approach. The second method we tried was to take all human Ig gene sequences listed and align them within each family. This way, we selected the optimal region, which was in the begin or in the middle of the V H FR1. Based on this alignment, the number of primers designed by our program at the 5 0 end of the V H region was 7, less than the number of primers designed by other authors. For 3 0 primer design, known FR4 sequences are normally chosen as the target sequences. The JH genes retrieved from IMGT databases were 13, so we appreciated designing degenerate primers manually.",
