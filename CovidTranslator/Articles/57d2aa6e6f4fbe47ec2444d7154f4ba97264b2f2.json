In a diseased state, abnormal cells display elevated cellular temperature compared to normal cells due to increased cellular metabolism. Therefore, developing a temperature sensor may allow differentiation of healthy cells from abnormal cells [1, 2] . Further, the accurate determination of temperature can be utilized to explain intricate biological processes from gene expression to energy metabolism [3] [4] [5] . Given the significance of in vivo temperature sensing, a number of techniques have been developed. Most of the techniques are based on thermal quenching of fluorescence intensity of fluorescent nanomaterials such as organic fluorescent dyes, quantum dots, nanoparticles, nanogels, and semi-conducting polymer dots [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . While these techniques are successful in measuring intracellular temperature, they require the introduction of physical objects or artificial probes through the plasma membrane or endocytotic pathway, which affects cell integrity or behavior and is also incompatible with cell imaging for long-term studies [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . To avoid external introduction of a probe into cells, we aimed to develop a novel temperature sensing method using in vivo expressing protein that would serve as a better tool for measuring intracellular temperature.",

            "text": "In general, genetically encoded fluorescent proteins are extensively utilized in the field of targeted labeling and imaging of proteins, organelles, cell tissues, and whole organisms [18] . Fluorescent proteins are autocatalytic in nature and do not require additional enzymes and cofactors to form a mature chromophore. Moreover, fluorescent proteins are easily expressing inside cells; this superior qualifying distinction enriches the fluorescent proteins over fluorescent nanomaterials. Recently, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was utilized to measure the intracellular temperature by using fluorescence polarization anisotropy [13, 14] . The main drawback of this methodology is the requirement of expensive instruments for measuring the intracellular temperature. Compared to GFP, red fluorescent proteins are highly advantageous due to their longer wavelength which helps to penetrate out from the target and exhibit less autofluorescence or background signals during imaging [19, 20] . Therefore, we chose mRFP1 as a temperature sensor to measure intracellular temperature based on change in the fluorescence intensity relative to temperature. The construct pQE-80L-mRFP1 and pQE-80L-mRFP1-P63A was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS (KC1325) Pro auxotroph. mRFP1 and mRFP1-P63A were expressed in LB media and purified as described earlier [21] . mRFP-P63A[(4R)-FP] was expressed in minimal media and purified as described earlier [21] . Briefly, the limiting concentration of Pro (0.05 mM) allowed cells to attain an OD 600 value of 0.6 ~ 0.8; and the target proteins were induced with 1 mM IPTG with simultaneous addition of (4R)-FP (0.5 mM) and allowed expression for 7 h. Harvested cells were subjected to centrifugation and stored at -70\u00b0C until further use. Collected cell pellet was suspended in lysis buffer (5 mM immidazole and 50 mM sodium-Phosphate buffer pH 7.5 containing protease inhibitor), followed by sonication and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm, 4\u00b0C for 20 min. The supernatant was saved as a soluble protein fraction and further soluble protein was purified by Ni-NTA column chromatography using standard protocol. Elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those enriched in the desired mRFP1 and its variants were pooled and dialyzed against 1X phosphate buffered saline. Protein concentration was quantified using Bradford assay. with rapid change of temperature from 4 to 40\u00b0C. Aliquot (10 \u00b5L) of protein solution (1 mg/mL) was added to 990 \u00b5L of water in a cuvette pre-incubated at 40\u00b0C, and fluorescence intensity was measured every 5 sec in a time drive mode using a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorescence spectrophotometer.",

            "text": "In temperature sensing methods based on fluorescent nanomaterials, the fluorescence intensity of nanomaterials decreased with an increase in temperature by thermal quenching of fluorescence. Similarly, we observed a change in fluorescence intensity of mRFP1 with a rapid change in the temperature from 4 to 40\u00b0C. Fluorescence intensity of mRFP1 decreased 40.5% of original fluorescence intensity and reached plateau after ~5 min (Fig. 1A) . Generally, proteins undergo conformational changes with changing temperatures [22, 23] . It is likely that mRFP1 takes ~5 min to reach equilibrium state of structure after conformational change and maintains constant fluorescence (Fig. 1A) . It is also possible that a decrease in fluorescence intensity is caused by simple thermal denaturation of mRFP1. To understand whether the change in fluorescence intensity of mRFP1 was influenced by thermal denaturation of proteins, circular dichroism (CD) studies were carried out. CD profiles of mRFP1 (3 \u00b5M) were initially analyzed by incubating in a cuvette for 10 min at room temperature (25\u00b0C). Then temperature was quickly raised to 40\u00b0C and CD analysis was carried out after 10 min incubation (Fig. 1B) . Since mRFP1 comprises 11 beta sheets, the CD profiles of mRFP1 at room temperature showed sharp negative major deflection at 218 ~ 220 nm and minor deflection at approximately 230 nm. CD profiles at 40\u00b0C showed that molar ellipticity of mRFP1 was reduced, but overall secondary structure of mRFP1 was unchanged based on the deflection pattern (Fig. 1B) . Finally, the temperature was bringing back to 25\u00b0C and CD analysis was carried out after 10 min incubation and the initial molar ellipticity of mRFP1 was recovered. Results confirmed that the decrease in fluorescence intensity of mRFP1 is caused by thermal quenching of fluorescence, not thermal denaturation of protein.",

Fluorescence intensity of mRFP1 decreased linearly with increase in temperature ( Fig. 2A) . Generally, a rise in temperature will give in greater absorptivity of mRFP1 for the exciting radiation, resulting in increased fluorescence intensity. In contrast, a rise in temperature will reduce fluorescence intensity by thermal quenching of the emitted fluorescence. Therefore, in the tested temperature range, thermal quenching of the emitted fluorescence is dominant [24] . Temperature sensitivity of mRFP1 is -1.28%/\u00b0C, which is comparable to Rhodamine B sensitivity of -3.5%/\u00b0C [25] .",

In each cycle, mRFP1 lost ~6.0% of initial fluorescence intensity. After three cycles, mRFP1 recovered 82.1% of initial fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2B) .

The half-life of mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] showed ~2.6 fold enhancement at 50\u00b0C compared to mRFP1. As, we expected mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] can be a better temperature sensor than mRFP1. Fluorescence intensities of mRFP1-P63A and mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] were examined with a rapid temperature change from 4 to 40\u00b0C as described above. Fluorescence intensity of mRFP1-P63A and mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] decreased 33.8 and 16.0% of original fluorescence intensity, respectively. Similarly with mRFP1, the fluorescence intensities of mRFP1-P63A and mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] took ~5 min to reach plateau after changing temperature from 4 to 40\u00b0C. CD analysis of mRFP1-P63A and mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] at different temperatures showed that the overall secondary structure was unchanged based on deflection pattern. Molar ellipticity of mRFP1-P63A and mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] at 40\u00b0C was reduced similarly with mRFP1. To examine temperature sensitivity, fluorescence emission spectra of mRFP1-P63A and mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] were determined in aqueous solution at different temperatures. An increase in temperature linearly reduced the fluorescence intensity of mRFP1-P63A and mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] (Fig. 2A). Temperature sensitivity of mRFP1-P63A and mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] was -1.26 and -0.77%/\u00b0C, respectively. mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] showed less temperature sensitivity than mRFP1 and mRFP1-P63A. This suggests that thermal quenching of emitted fluorescence is affected by incorporating",

NCAA. The fusion protein with different NCAA containing variants of different sensitivity can create a new strategy in developing a ratiometric temperature sensor [10-12]. Further, the robustness of mRFP1-P63A and mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] were examined through a temperature gradient experiment. In each cycle, mRFP1-P63A and mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] lost 5.6 and 1.5% of initial fluorescence intensity, respectively. After three cycles, mRFP1-P63A and mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] recovered 83.1 and 95.5% of initial fluorescence intensity, respectively (Figs. 3A and 3B). Recovered fluorescence intensity of mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] (95.5%) was higher than mRFP1 (82.1%) and mRFP1-P63A (83.1%). mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] showed less hysteresis during the heating and cooling cycle. mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] has excellent stability and reversibility, so mRFP1-P63A[(4R)-FP] is suitable than mRFP1 for general usage such as monitoring of temperature changes in thermophiles.",
