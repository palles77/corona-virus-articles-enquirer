The aim of this study was to determine bacterial coinfections in children hospitalized for acute expiratory wheezing with defined viral etiology. A total of 220 children aged 3 months to 16 years were investigated. The viral etiology of wheezing was confirmed by viral culture, antigen detection, serologic investigation, and/or PCR. Specific antibodies to common respiratory bacteria were measured from acute and convalescent serum samples. All children were examined clinically for acute otitis media, and subgroups of children were examined radiologically for sinusitis and pneumonia. Rhinovirus (32%), respiratory syncytial virus (31%), and enteroviruses (31%) were the most common causative viruses. Serologic evidence of bacterial coinfection was found in 18% of the children.",

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common bacterial coinfection that occurs in 20-60% of cases of different respiratory virus infections [2, 3] .

Although development of AOM is closely associated with viral respiratory infections, it is generally considered a bacterial infection, since bacteria can be cultured from middle ear fluid in up to 90% of the children [13] . Clinically, it was important to note that, on admission, when the median duration of illness was 3 days, only 65% of the cases of AOM were detected and the rest were found during the follow-up period. In a previous study of the temporal development of AOM, we showed that 54% of AOM cases develop during the first 4 days after the onset of respiratory infection and 75% during the first week of illness [14] . Our findings of viral dependence agree with previous studies. RSV infection is the major risk factor for AOM; in this study, 70% of the children with RSV infection developed AOM [2, 3] . A novel observation was that enterovirus infection can be associated with AOM in one-third of the cases [15] .",

In children, bacterial sinusitis should be suspected clinically if the symptoms of respiratory infection last for \u226510 days [12] . In young children, a great problem is that paranasal radiographs do not detect the opacity or mucosal thickness of the maxillary sinuses due to the similar density of the adjacent bone structures. For these two reasons, we only studied children \u22653 years of age, and we examined them 2 weeks after the acute illness. Even then, one-sixth of the children studied showed radiologic and clinical evidence of sinusitis. These findings raise questions about whether all these children with symptom- In earlier studies, 6-9% of children with a first episode of wheezing had had a pathologic chest radiograph [17] . We found no cases of lobar alveolar consolidation on chest radiographs, suggesting that typical bacterial pneumonia is a rare complication of viral wheezing. Three children had serologic evidence of bacterial infection and alveolar infiltrates. Nearly all children studied had minor interstitial infiltrates, suggesting that acute wheezing may present a prototype of viral pneumonia in children. This is further supported by the finding that pneumonic crackles can be often heard on auscultation in children with wheezing [17, 18] . The chest radiograph may not be sensitive enough to show the whole profile of lung infiltrates as seen in adults with pneumonia [19] . In clinical practice, chest radiographs should not be routinely performed in wheezy children, since they do not improve treatment results and may lead to inappropriate antibiotic use.",

They can seldom be cultured from the blood, and invasive procedures such as tympanocentesis, maxillary sinus puncture, or lung tap are not beneficial and are not used in clinical practice. Measurement of antibody responses to these bacteria offers a noninvasive approach. Several studies have shown that 30-70% of children with pneumonia develop IgG antibodies against these bacteria, and measurements of specific antibody responses have been used in research [10, [20] [21] [22] [23] . Very few patients with viral upper respiratory tract infection develop serologic responses to bacteria. For example, none of 26 children with parainfluenza virus-induced laryngitis [24] and 2 of 200 young adults with the common cold, usually caused by rhinovirus [25] , showed a serologic response. This suggests that respiratory viral infections do not provide a nonspecific immune stimulation. Furthermore, only 2.7% of the 148 asymptomatic children had a significant increase in antibodies to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or M. catarrhalis in paired serum samples obtained 1 month apart [26] .",

No cases of alveolar pneumonia alone or of lobar alveolar consolidation alone were seen. Of the ten children with alveolar pneumonia, three had serologic evidence of bacterial infection (C. pneumoniae in 2 and S. pneumoniae in 1). Paranasal radiographs at the follow-up visit showed total opacity in 9 and mucosal thickening of \u22654 mm in 4 of the 48 children \u22653 years of age studied. Eight of these children (17% of the 48 studied) had respiratory signs and symptoms at the follow-up visit that fulfilled criteria for clinical sinusitis. None of the children with sinusitis had positive serologic findings for bacteria.Antibiotic treatment was given in the hospital to 102 of 220 (46%) children: 87 for AOM and 20 for pneumonia (five children had both AOM and pneumonia). During the 2-week follow-up period, another 17 (8%) children were treated with antibiotics: 8 for AOM, 3 for sinusitis, 3 for M. pneumoniae infection, and 3 for C. pneumoniae infection.",
