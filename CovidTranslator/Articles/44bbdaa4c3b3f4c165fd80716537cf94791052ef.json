            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease associated with a novel coronavirus and causing worldwide outbreaks. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an enveloped RNA virus, which contains several structural proteins. Among these proteins, spike (S) protein is responsible for binding to specific cellular receptors and is a major antigenic determinant, which induces neutralizing antibody. In order to analyze the antigenicity and receptor-binding ability of SARS-CoV S protein, we expressed the S protein in Escherichia coli using a pET expression vector. After the isopropyl-b-D D -thiogalactoside induction, S protein was expressed in the soluble form and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography to homogeneity. The amount of S protein recovered was 0.2-0.3 mg/100 ml bacterial culture. The S protein was recognized by sera from SARS patients by ELISA and Western blot, which indicated that recombinant S protein retained its antigenicity. By biotinylated ELISA and Western blot using biotinlabeled S protein as the probe, we identified 130-kDa and 140-kDa proteins in Vero cells that might be the cellular receptors responsible for SARS-CoV infection. Taken together, these results suggested that recombinant S protein exhibited the antigenicity and receptor-binding ability, and it could be a good candidate for further developing SARS vaccine and anti-SARS therapy.",

A novel coronavirus has been identified as the etiological agent of SARS and designated as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) after tests of causation according to Koch's postulates, including monkey inoculation [2] [3] [4] . SARS-CoV can infect African green monkey kidney (Vero E6) cells and cause a similar disease in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) [2, 3] . The full-length genome sequence of SARS-CoV has been elucidated within weeks after the identification of this novel pathogen [5, 6] . SARS-CoV contains a single-stranded plus-sense RNA genome about 30 kb in length that has a 5 0 -cap structure and a 3 0 -polyadenylation tract. The genomic organization is typical of coronaviruses, having five major open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the replicase polyproteins; the spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) glycoproteins; and the nucleocapsid protein (N) in the same order as those of other coronaviruses [5] [6] [7] .",

These proteins, in turn, are responsible for replicating the viral genome as well as generating nested transcripts that are used in the synthesis of viral proteins. Viral membrane proteins, including S and M are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while RNA genome assembles with the N protein. This RNAprotein complex then associates with M proteins and buds into the lumen of the ER. The virus particles then migrate through the Golgi complex and exist in the cells by exocytosis [7] . The first step in viral infection is the binding of viral proteins to certain cellular receptors. So far, the S protein of coronavirus is considered as the site of viral attachment to the host cells [8, 9] .",

S proteins are responsible for both binding to receptors on host cells and for membrane fusion [11, 12] . S proteins also contain important virus-neutralizing epitopes that elicit neutralizing antibody in the host species [13, 14] . Furthermore, mutations in this gene dramatically affect the virulence, pathogenesis, and host cell tropism [15] [16] [17] . These results suggested that S protein is a good candidate for vaccine because neutralizing antibodies are directed against S. Moreover, S protein is also a good target for antiviral therapies because blockade of binding of S protein to cellular receptor can prevent virus entry. Therefore, in this study, we expressed the SARS-CoV S protein in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The antigenicity and receptor-binding ability of recombinant S protein were further analyzed.",

The predicted S gene is located from nucleotide 21,492 to 25,259 in the SARS-CoV genome. In order to clone S gene, the 3580-bp DNA fragment containing whole S gene was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and inserted into prokaryotic vector pET-28(+). The deduced amino acid sequence of S protein is shown in Fig. 2 . S gene had an ORF of 3768 nucleotides, capable of coding for a 1255-amino-acid polypeptide of about 138 kDa. The amino terminus of SARS-CoV S protein contained a short type I signal peptide (residue 1-13) composed of hydrophobic amino acids that are presumably removed during cotranslational transport through ER. The carboxyl terminus (residue 1196-1255) consisted of a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail rich in cysteine residues. Twenty-three potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted among SARS-CoV S protein. Together these data predicted that SARS-CoV S protein is a type I membrane glycoprotein with the N-terminus and the majority of the protein (residue 14-1195) on the outside of virus particle, in agreement with other coronavirus S protein data (Fig. 1B) .",

Alignment of these sequences produced a low level of similarity (20-27% pairwise amino acid identity) between the predicted amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV S protein and other coronavirus S proteins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the species formed monophyletic clusters consistent with established taxonomic groups. However, SARS-CoV S protein sequences segregated into a well-resolved branch, indicating that SARS-CoV S protein is not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronavirus S proteins. Although overall sequence conservation was low, the C-terminus, consisting of a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail, was highly conserved. Putative cellular receptor-binding sites (residue 757-761) of SARS-CoV S protein [19] were not conserved compared with other coronaviruses. The antigenic sites of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus S protein [20, 21] were also varied among these coronaviruses.

The recombinant S protein was expressed in soluble form in bacterial cells, and the amount of protein recovered was 0.2-0.3 mg/ 100 ml bacterial culture. The S protein was recognized by sera from SARS patients, indicating that recombinant S protein retained its antigenicity. By biotinylated ELISA and Western blot using recombinant S protein as the probe, we identified that 130-kDa and 140-kDa proteins might be the cellular receptors responsible for SARS-CoV infection. These results suggested that S protein could be a good candidate for further developing SARS vaccine and anti-SARS therapy.",

The secondary structure and putative antigenic sites of SARS-CoV S protein were analyzed by PeptideStructure program of GCG using the Chou-Fasman prediction. Secondary structure was drawn with the PloStructure program. The predicted antigenic sites are shown as octagons. The putative glycosylation sites are shown as balloons.",
