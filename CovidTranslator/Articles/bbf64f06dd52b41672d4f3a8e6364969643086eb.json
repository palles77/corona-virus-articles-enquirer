The formation of immature secretory granules was as fast (tn = 5 min) as that of constitutive secretory vesicles identified by the presence of a rapidly secreted heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Using the cellfree system, the formation of post-Golgi secretory vesicles was found to be dependent upon ATP. Two distinct populations of vesicles were formed: immature secretory granules containing secretogranin II and constitutive secretory vesicles containing the heparan sulfate proteoglycan. These results show that in a cell-free system, a constitutive and a regulated secretory protein are sorted upon exit from the trans-Golgi network.",

As to the site of segregation of the constitutive and regulated secretory pathway, different conclusions have been reached. Electron microscopical studies on neuroendocrine cells have suggested that segregation occurs upon exit from the TGN; markers for the constitutive and regulated pathway were found to be colocalized in this compartment, but only the regulated secretory proteins were detected in immature and mature secretory granules (Orci et al., 1987; Tooze et al., 1987) . On the other hand, biochemical studies on exocrine cells have suggested that sorting of constitutive and regulated secretory proteins also occurs in immature secretory granules (von Zastrow and Castle, 1987) . It is unclear whether these different conclusions reflect the fact that in the electron microscopical studies, viral particles and membrane proteins rather than secretory proteins were used as markers for the constitutive pathway, that differences exist between neuroendocrine and exocrine cells, or that different methodologies were used.",

Immature secretory granules, however, are the first distinct post-TGN compartment en route to the mature secretory granule (Farquhar et al., 1978; Tooze and Tooze, 1986) . Understanding the formation of immature granules is, therefore, a prerequisite to understanding the biogenesis of secretory granules. In addition, immature secretory granules may well be a sorting station; the stringency of segregation of constitutive secretory proteins or of Golgi-resident proteins from regulated secretory proteins during the formation of immature secretory granules is unknown, and removal of the former proteins from immature granules would improve the overall fidelity of the sorting process.",

Second, the formation of postTGN vesicles containing the labeled markers was monitored by physically separating these vesicles from the donor compartment, the TGN. Sulfated Marker Proteins of the Constitutive and Regulated Secretory Pathways Sulfation of proteins on tyrosine is an established trans-Golgi-specific posttranslational modification (Baeuerle and Huttner, 1987) . Cells of the neuroendocrine line PC12 contain two major tyrosine-sulfated proteins, secretogranins I and II (Sgl and Sgll), that are very efficiently (m95%) targeted to secretory granules (Lee and Huttner, 1983; Rosa et al., 1985b Rosa et al., , 1989 Gerdes et al., 1989; S. A. Tooze and W. 6. Huttner, unpublished data) and thus are ideal markers to follow the transport of regulated secretory proteins from the TGN to secretory granules. PC12 cells also contain sulfated proteoglycans (Schubert et al., 1988; Gowda et al., 1989) and the sulfation of the carbohydrate chains of proteoglycans, too, is a transQolgi-specific event (Kimura et al., 1984) . Figure 1 shows that in PC12 cells, sulfated proteoglycans are excluded from secretory granules and can be used as markers for the constitutive pathway of secretion. Incubation of PC12 cells for 10 min with [35S)sulfate resulted in the labeling of both Sgl and Sgll as well as a component with diffuse electrophoretic mobility between the top of the gel and the Sgl region ( Figure 1A ); this component proved to be sensitive to heparinase II (data not shown) and thus was a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (hsPG), consistent with previous studies showing the presence of one major hsPG in PC12 cells (Schubert et al., 1988; Gowda et al., 1989) . Sulfate-labeled hsPG was secreted within 40 min of chase while virtually no Sgll appeared in the medium (Figure lA, lanes 4-6). (The \"Sgl region\" of the gel could not be interpreted with respect to regulated vs. constitutive secretion; this region contained not only sulfate-labeled Sgl but also some of the sulfatelabeled hsPG, as shown by the analysis of sulfate linkage and two-dimensional PAGE.)",

Viral membrane proteins that reach the cell surface via the constitutive pathway are arrested in the TGN when the temperature is lowered to 20% (Matlin and Simons, 1983) . We tested whether this temperature block also inhibited the intracellular transport and secretion of the hsPG (Figure 1B) . When PC12 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]sulfate for 10 min at 20% and then chased at 20\u00b0C, the secretion of the hsPG into the medium was inhibited over a 60 min chase period (Figure lB, lanes 3 and 4) . However, when the temperature was then raised for 30 min from 20\u00b0C to 37%, the hsPG was rapidly secreted (Figure 16 , lane 5). Sgll was not secreted during the chase at either 20% or 37% ( Figure 1B ).",

PC12 cells were pulselabeled for 5 min with [%]sulfate, with or without a subsequent chase in vivo, and then homogenized. Because sulfate uptake, sulfate activation, and translocation of activated sulfate are known to take ~2 min (Baeuerle and Huttner, 1987) , the effective labeling time was ~3 min. Organelles in the postnuclear supernatant (PNS) were then fractionated on a velocity-controlled continuous sucrose gradient designed to separate the TGN from post-TGN secretory vesicles. After a 5 min pulse, a single peak of labeled proteins was detected in the bottom half of the gradient (peak in fractions 9 and lo), which contained both Sgll and the hsPG ( Figure 2A ). This peak coincided with that of the TGN marker enzyme sialyltransferase (Roth et al., 1985;  see Figure 3D below), confirming that these proteins were present in the TGN at the end of the 5 min pulse. After a 15 min chase, most of the labeled Sgll and the hsPG was found in the top half of the gradient (fractions 1-5, Figure 2B ), suggesting that the labeled proteins had left the TGN during this time period and were now present in post-EN vesicles. (The finding that the [%]Sgllcontaining post-TGN vesicles sedimented more slowly than the TGN in these velocity-controlled gradients, although they would be expected to be at least as dense, probably reflected the smaller size of these vesicles compared with the TGN [see Figure 6 , below].) Thus, pulsechase labeling of Sgll and the hsPG in PC12 cells with [35S]sulfate followed by velocity gradient centrifugation of the PNS is a means of biochemically identifying, and separating from one another, the TGN and post-TGN vesicles.",

(C) and (D) A PNS prepared from PC12 cells labeled for 5 min with [35S]sulfate in vivo was incubated for 60 min at 37% in vitro and subjected to velocity gradient centrifugation.

A PNS prepared from cells pulselabeled for 5 min with [%]sulfate in vivo and chased for 15 min in vivo was subjected to velocity gradient centrifugation, and fractions l-4 were subjected to equilibrium centrifugation followed by analysis as in secretory proteins is the constitutive vesicle. If these two different classes of proteins are respectively packaged directly into either immature secretory granules or constitutive secretory vesicles upon exit from the TGN, then Sgll and the hsPG should be in two different vesicle populations after an in vitro budding reaction. In contrast, if some of the constitutive and the regulated secretory proteins were transiently colocalized in post-TGN vesicles and then segregated from one another, a portion of Sgll and the hsPG should be in the same vesicle population after an in vitro budding reaction. To investigate whether the sulfate-labeled Sgll and hsPG were present in one or more post-TGN vesicle populations, various fractions from the velocity gradient were subjected to a second, equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation.",

In contrast, equilibrium centrifugation of the post-TGN vesicles formed during an in vitro incubation of the PNS at 37% (fractions l-4 of the velocity gradient) resolved these into two distinct populations, one containing the sulfatelabeled hsPG (peaking in fraction 6, density 1.098 g/ml) and another containing sulfate-labeled Sgll (peaking in fraction 9, density 1.131 g/ml), each characterized by a bell-shaped distribution across the gradient without detectable shoulders (Figures 5C and 5D ). This indicated that during the in vitro incubation these two proteins had been packaged into different vesicles. The post-TGN vesicles formed in vivo, found in the top half of the velocity gradient after a 5 min sulfate pulse followed by a 15 min chase, were also resolved into two distinct populations ( Figure 5E ). The sedimentation behavior of the two vesicle populations formed in vitro was very similar to that of the two post-TGN vesicle populations formed in vivo (compare Figures 5D and 5E ).",

In several instances, dense-core aggregates were seen in the lumen of these membrane-enclosed compartments, and these closely resembled aggregates in the TGN of fixed cells (Tooze and Tooze, 1966) . Analysis of the Sgllcontaining post-TGN vesicle fraction ( Figure  6D ) showed that it was highly enriched in membraneenclosed dense-core aggregates whose appearance closely resembled that of immature secretory granules (Tooze and Tooze, 1966) .

Thereafter, the rate of appearance of sulfate-labeled Sgll in the immature granules decreased, indicating a reduction in either the rate of granule formation or the specific activity of labeled Sgll by mixing with unlabeled Sgll in the TGN.

Several lines of evidence indicated that the two vesicle populations formed in vitro, containing either sulfated Sgll or sulfated hsPG, were immature secretory granules and constitutive secretory vesicles, respectively. First, the cell-free formed vesicles were indistinguishable in their sedimentation behavior upon sequential velocity and equilibrium centrifugation from the immature secretory granules and constitutive secretory vesicles formed in vivo. Second, the cell-free formed vesicles containing hsPG had a similar density to that recently reported for constitutive secretory vesicles from BHK cells (de Curtis and Simons, 1989) , and the cell-free formed Sgll-containing vesicles had a significantly greater density, as expected for immature secretory granules. Third, the cell-free formed vesicles lacked sialyltransferase activity, and their formation was ATP-dependent, indicating that they were post-EN vesicles resulting from specific budding events rather than vesicles resulting from the fragmentation of the TGN.",

In this context, it has been hypothesized that the selective aggregation of regulated secretory proteins is involved in their sorting from constitutive secretory proteins (Kelly, 1985; Huttner et al., 1988b; Gerdes et al., 1989; Tooze et al., 1989) , and this might provide part of the driving force for budding of an immature secretory granule from the TGN.

            "text": "The Site of Sorting of Regulated Secretory Proteins By monitoring the dynamics of secretory protein transport from the TGN to post-TGN vesicles in vivo and in the cellfree system, we provide direct evidence that most, if not all, of the segregation of constitutive and regulated secretory proteins in neuroendocrine cells occurs upon exit from the TGN. The distinct, bell-shaped distribution of the hsPG-containing constitutive secretory vesicles and the Sgll-containing immature secretory granules across the equilibrium gradient did not support the existence of post-TGN vesicles containing significant amounts of both markers. This distribution was observed in vivo as well as in the cell-free system and was in striking contrast to the comigration of these two markers upon equilibrium centrifugation of the TGN-derived membranes. Because the distribution of the hsPG and Sgll across gradients was distinct at the earliest studied time point after exit from the TGN, after 5 min of chase in vivo, these two markers ap-pear to be largely sorted from one another when leaving the TGN via constitutive secretory vesicles and immature secretory granules, respectively. Our direct demonstration of the TGN as the major sorting station for constitutive and regulated secretory proteins in neuroendocrine cells is consistent with previous results of morphological studies (Orci et al., 1987; Tooze et al., 1987) and differs from the conclusion reached in a study with exocrine cells (von Zastrow and Castle, 1987) .",

            "text": "The Fate of Immature Secretory Granules One of the unexpected findings was the size of the immature granules (80 nm core), which was significantly smaller than that reported by others (Greene and Tischler, 1978; Watanabe et al., 1983) and also observed by us (S. A. Tooze, J. Tooze, W. B. Huttner, unpublished data) for mature secretory granules of PC12 cells (115 nm core). The small size of the immature granules was not an artifact resulting from prolonged exposure to hypertonic sucrose, since the same size was observed after 15 min of sedimentation into approximately isotonic sucrose (data not shown). In line with the observation of double-cored granules, one possible explanation would be that in PC12 cells, mature secretory granules originate by fusion of two or more immature granules, as was previously suggested for secretory granules in endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary (Farquhar et al., 1978) . This would imply removal of the excess membrane present after fusion of immature granules. It is tempting to speculate that this membrane removal may be a means of recycling membrane proteins, involved in the sorting of regulated secretory proteins and the formation of immature granules, back to the TGN. Although the recycling of such membrane proteins could in principle occur from the mature secretory granules via the plasma membrane, the recycling from immature granules to the TGN would render the formation of immature granules independent of the exocytosis of mature granules. Whatever the fate of the membrane retrieved after fusion of immature granules may be, it is likely that immature secretory granules are not just carrier vesicles, as constitutive secretory vesicles are thought to be, but may well be a branching point for membrane traffic.",

PC12 cells were depleted of endogenous sulfate and pulse-labeled with [35S]sulfate without subsequent chase as described above. They were then immediately placed on ice to prevent any intracellular transport. Preparation of Postnuclear Supernatant Unless otherwise indicated, all steps were performed at 4OC. PC12 cells, either labeled or unlabeled, were washed twice with TESS (Trisbuffered saline plus sulfate: 4.5 mM KCI, 137 mM NaCI, 0.7 mM NasHP04, 1.6 mM NasS04, 25 mM Tris-HCI [pH 7.41) and once with TBSS plus protease inhibitors (pi; 0.5 mM PMSF and 10 nglml Trasylol). Each 15 cm* dish of cells was scraped off in 10 ml of TBSSlpi using a cut silicone stopper attached to a disposable pipette. Typically, after this step -20% of the cells were permeable to trypan blue. Cells from two dishes were pooled and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 700 x g, washed once in homogenization buffer plus sulfate containing protease inhibitors (HBSlpi: 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Mg acetate, 1.6 mM NazS04, 10 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.21 pi as above), and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1700 x g. Each cell pellet was resuspended in 5 times its volume of HBSIpi (typically 1 ml) and passed through a 22-gauge needle until a singlecell suspension was obtained. The cell suspension was then homogenized in the cell cracker originally designed by Balch et al. (1964) and manufactured by the EMBL workshop, using an 16 urn clearance. The cell cracker was rinsed with 1 ml of HBS/pi, and the rinse was pooled with the initial homogenate, yielding a total volume of approximately 1.6 ml. This homogenization procedure resulted in >96% of the cells being broken, with intact nuclei as assessed by light microscopy. The nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10 min. The resulting PNS routinely contained 3-4 mglml of protein as measured by the modified Lowry assay (Markwell et al., 1976) using bovine serum albumin as standard. In Vitro Incubation of the PNS The standard condition developed to obtain cell-free formation of immature secretory granules and constitutive secretory vesicles was as follows: 1.25 ml of the PNS in HBSlpi prepared from sulfate-labeled PC12 cells was supplemented at 4OC with 25 ~1 of 1 mM PAPS to inhibit additional radioactive sulfate incorporation during the incubation, 25 nl of 10 mM Mg acetate, and 50 nl of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system prepared according to Davey et al. (1965) (corresponding to 16.7 nl of 100 mM ATP 16.7 nl of 600 mM creatine phosphate, and 16.7 nl of 4 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase in 50% [w/v] glycerol). In some experiments, 50 nl of 10 mg/ml of hexokinase in 250 mM D-glucose (Davey et al., 1965) was added instead of ATP and the ATPregenerating system. In other experiments, the PNS in addition received 10 FM GTPTS. The PNS was then placed at 37\"C (t = 0) and incubated without further agitation for 20 min to 2 hr. Controls were supplemented as above and kept on ice for the same times. After the incubation at either temperature, the PNS was subjected to velocity centrifugation. In time course experiments, samples after incubation at 3PC were transferred to and kept on ice until the last time point and then subjected to velocity centrifugation. Velocity and Equilibrium Centrifugation For the separation of post-TGN secretory vesicles (immature granules and constitutivevesicles) and theTGN, velocity centrifugation was performed using a linear sucrose gradient prepared from 0.3 M (5.5 ml) to 1.2 M (6.0 ml) sucrose in 10 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2). Approximately 1.3 ml of the PNS was loaded onto the gradient, which was then centrifuged at 25,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40 rotor for 15 min (after having reached the final speed), with the brake applied at the end of the run. Fractions (1 ml) were collected from top to bottom of the gradient. The fractions were subjected to equilibrium centrifugation or aliquots of them were subjected to acetone precipitation, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography.",

In some experiments, radioactive Sgll was quantitated by densitometric scanning of the fluorograms, using the LKB gel scanner and software. hsPG The sulfate-labeled smear migrating between 95-200 kd was demonstrated to be a heparan sulfate proteoglycan by digestion with heparinase II as described by Schubert et al.

After fixation overnight at 4%, the samples were diluted B-fold with a 1:l mixture of HBS (without sulfate) and fixative and pelleted for 80 min at 36,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40 rotor. The supernatant was removed and the samples were processed and embedded in Epon as previously described rooze and Tooze, 1986) . Ultrathin sections were cut and viewed in a Zeiss EM10 electron microscope. The size of the immature granules was quantitated by measuring the diameter of the dense core of the granules from negatives taken at a magnification of 17,000x. Only those profiles were chosen where the limiting granule membrane was clearly visible. Immature granules with multiple cores were not included in the quantitation.",

The PNS from each time point was subjected to velocity gradient centrifugation. Fractions from each gradient (1, top; 12, bottom) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by fluorography and quantitation of the radioactivity in the hsPG (bracket; the thick portion indicates the area used for quantitation) and Sgll. The fluorograms show the distribution of the hsPG and Sgll across the gradients after the 5 min pulse (A) and the 5 min pulse followed by a 15 min chase (B). (C) Time course of appearance of the labeled hsPG and Sgll in post-TGN secretory vesicles. Fractions containing constitutive secretory vesicles (CV) and immature secretory granules (ISG) were identified from the autoradiograms (see the open and closed bar in [B], respectively), and the [35S]hsPG and the [35S]Sgll in these fractions was quantitated and is expressed as percent of the total (sum of fraccell surface can be selectively monitored by sulfate labeling.",
