In coronavirus pneumonia, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), accompanied by rapid virus replication, a large number of inflammatory cell infiltration and CS led to acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death [1, 2] . Accumulating evidence revealed that a part of severe COVID-19 patients have a elevated cytokine profile resembling CS in SARS and MERS. Huang et al. reported the level of inflammatory factors in patients with COVID-19. They measured cytokine levels in 41 inpatients (including 13 ICU patients and 28 non ICU patients), IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IFN\u03b3, granulocytecolony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were increased, among which IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, TNF\u03b1 were higher in severe patients [3, 4] . Notably, there was not pronounce difference of serum IL-6 level been the ICU and non ICU patients. However, in another retrospective, multicentre cohort study, the same study group reported a significantly elevation of IL-6 level in non-survival group of patients with COVID-19, as compared with that of the survivals [5] . Several other reports also confirmed the elevation of IL-6 in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [6] [7] [8] .",

It is possible that CS exacerbates lung damage as well as leads to other fetal complications. Siddiqu and Mehra [11] proposed a 3-stage classification model, recognizing that COVID-19 illness exhibited three grades of increasing severity which corresponded with distinct clinical findings, response to therapy and clinical outcome. A small proportion of COVID-19 patients would transit into the third and most severe stage of illness, which manifested as an extrapulmonary systemic hyperinflammation syndrome. In this stage, markers of systemic inflammation appeared to be extremely elevated. Therefore, how to block the CS and when to initiate anti-inflammation therapy is critical for reducing death rate of COVID-19.",

Spleen atrophy was observed in all reported cases with decreased numbers of lymphocyte, and significant cell degeneration, focal hemorrhagic necrosis, macrophage proliferation and macrophage phagocytosis were found in spleen. Similarly, lymph node atrophy and the number of lymph nodes decreased, accompanied by necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells were decreased in spleen and lymph nodes [13] . In addition, in the lung with characteristic diffused alveolar damage (DAD), the major infiltrated cells were monocytes and macrophages, moderate multinucleated giant cells, but very few lymphocytes. Most of the infiltrating lymphocytes were CD4-positive T cells. Importantly, virus inclusion bodies can still be detected in type II alveolar epithelia and macrophages, despite that the PCR test was negative in blood or throat swabs [10, 12, 14] . This finding is consistent with the characteristics of the so called \"primary cytokine\" storm induced by viral infection which were mainly produced by alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells and endothelial cells, rather than those observed in \"secondary cytokine\" storm induced by different subsets of activated T lymphocytes in late stage of viral infection or a complication of T cell-engaging therapies [15, 16] .",

Intriguingly, some patients were tested positive with high titer antiphospholipid antibodies, including anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein antibodies, and were associated with severe thrombosis (unpublished data). The underlying mechanism of vascular damage may be due to the direct injury of endothelial cells by virus, leading to DIC, anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) and mimicry of vasculitis.

As CS is relatively common in severe case and often leads to the exacerbation, anti-inflammation therapy may help in preventing further injury. As we know, there are a variety of anti-inflammatory medications, including non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, immunosuppressants, inflammatory cytokines antagonists (such as IL-6R monoclonal antibodies, TNF inhibitors, IL-1 antagonists, janus kinase inhibitor (JAK) inhibitors, et al. Siddiqu and Mehra suggested that tailored therapy in stage III hinges on the use of immunomodulatory agents to reduce systemic inflammation before it overwhelmingly results in multi-organ dysfunction. In this phase, use of corticosteroids may be justified in concert with the use of cytokine inhibitors such as tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) or anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist). Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) may also play a role in modulating an immune system that is in a hyperinflammatory state. Overall, the prognosis and recovery from this critical stage of illness is poor, and prompt recognition and application of such therapy may have the greatest yield [11, 17] .",

Which patient should we treat with anti-inflammation regimen, and when to start? What is the treatment duration? Which medication is the best choice? All the above questions are still under intense debate and do not reach a consensus. The main concern is that anti-inflammatory medications, such as corticosteroid, may delay the elimination of virus and increase the risk of secondary infection, especially in those with impaired immune system. Secondly, biological agents targeting on pro-inflammatory cytokines can only inhibit specific inflammatory factor, and thus may not be very effective in curbing the CS in COVID-19 in which other cytokines maybe of significant importance. Thirdly, some anti-inflammation medication such as JAK inhibitors also block INF-a production, which is important in fighting virus, and theoretically may not be suitable for the treatment of inflammatory CS caused by virus as COVID-19. Finally, the time window of anti-inflammatory treatment is very important. According to reports and our observation, severe patients usually underwent abrupt deterioration in 1-2 weeks after onset, and prompt initiation of the anti-inflammatory therapy at this extremely short time window is likely to achieve a favorable treatment response.",

One of the known regulators of endocytosis is the AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1).

Baricitinib, a JAK inhibitor as well as an AAK1 inhibitor, was suggested a possible candidate for treatment of COVID-19, considering its relative safety and high affinity.

They can also interfere with the post-translational modification of viral proteins or impair the proper maturation of viral protein by pH modulation [36] . In addition, CQ and HCQ can regulate immune system by affecting cell signaling and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

Whether their immunomodulatory effect also plays a role in the treatment of COVID-19 still requires further investigation. For coronaviruses, the potential therapeutic benefits of CQ were notably reported for SARS-CoV-1. In vitro, CQ can prevent SARS-CoV-1 from infecting the glycosylation of a virus cell surface receptor, ACE2 [30] . A very recent publication of results showed that CQ is highly effective in the control of COVID-19 infection in vitro [37] .",

So far, in a clinical trial involving more than 100 patients, the chloroquine phosphate group showed efficacy in reducing the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings and increasing negative rate of virus nucleic acid test. Given these findings, the Guidelines (version 6) for treatment of COVID-19 recommends chloroquine phosphate is orally administered at a dose of 500 mg (300 mg for chloroquine) for adults, 2 times/ day (no more than 10 days) [39] . \"Hydroxychloroquine's therapeutic effect on new coronavirus (COVID-19)\" was registered (NO: ChiCTR2000029559). As of February 17, 20 patients have been enrolled in HCQ & basic treatment group. After 1-2 days of HCQ treatment, clinical symptoms in all patients improved. After 5 days of HCQ treatment, 19 patients improved on lung imaging findings. In addition, none of the mild patients had an exacerbation of disease in HCQ group. Regarding to safety, two of them had adverse reactions of mild rash and slight headache, and the adverse reactions disappeared after adjusting the regimen. The results of this clinical trial confirmed the short-term efficacy of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19, which can effectively improve lung imaging findings, promote a virus-negative conversion, and shorten the disease course. Although the number of cases in HCQ group was relatively small, current data can provide insights for clinicians. The efficacy and safety of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 need to be confirmed in further preclinical and clinical trials.",

As CS occurs in critical patients, which leads to ARDS and multiple organ damage, and even death, anti-inflammation treatment may be applied. However, given the viral nature of the COVID-19 CS, and considering a substantial impairness of host immune system in severe cases, it is critical to balance the risk and benefit ratio before starting anti-inflammation therapy. In addition, a timely anti-inflammation treatment initiated at the right window time is of pivotal importance and should be tailored in individual patient to achieve the most favorable effects.",
