Each layer represents one of the main four settings where influenza transmission occurs, namely households, schools, workplaces, and the general community [2, 3, 4] . The household layer is composed by n h disconnected components, each one representing one household (i.e., the total number of households is n h ). Each household is composed by a certain amount of nodes, each one representing one single individual. The amount of nodes in each household is determined by sampling from the actual Italian household size distribution. An age is associated to each node by sampling from the actual Italian age distribution by household size using an algorithm tailored to match realistic age-gaps between household members (details in Fumanelli et al. [1] ). Each node lives also in the community layer, which is composed by one single giant fully connected component. By sampling from the multinomial distribution of schooling and employment rates by age, for each node is determined whether it also lives in the school or workplace layer. Analogously to what has been described for the household layer, the workplace layer is composed by n w disconnected components, each one representing one workplace. The number of nodes in each workplace is sampled from the actual Italian workplace size distribution. The school layer is composed by n s disconnected components, each one representing one school. The number of nodes in each school is sampled from the actual Italian school size distribution by school level (e.g., pre-school, primary school, middle school, high school).

Simulations are initialized with one infectious individual and no further introductions of index cases is assumed. One of the most striking features of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, observed in several studies focusing on different countries around the globe, was the presence of an age-specific susceptibility to infection, which was remarkably higher for young individuals (mainly corresponding to school-age individuals) [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] . In our model we use the estimates of age-specific susceptibility rates specific for the Italian population [5] : As direct estimates of the layer-specific transmission rates, we estimated them on the basis of agespecific seroprevalence data collected in Italy after the end of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [5] . Since the per-contact transmission probability p and the four layer-specific transmission rates w l are multiplying factors in Equation (1) (and thus cannot be estimated simultaneously), we fixed p = 1 and estimated w h , w s , w w , and w c .",

The value of R index (which is set to 1.3, in the ballpark for influenza [15] ) is obtained by empirically choosing the per-contact transmission probability p such that the average reproduction number of the index case, averaged over 10,000 simulations is equal to 1.3.",

Indeed, the same temporal trend of R(t) can be observed in all layers, close to what happens for the data-driven model in the community layer (Fig. S10B) . It is worth recalling that, although those models keep the degree distribution statistically equivalent to that of the data-driven model, the stochastic rewiring destroys temporal and topological correlations. The quenched configuration model, freezes the topological correlations of the model in time, and shows some deviations from the homogeneous model in terms of R(t), although not as marked as in the data driven model. This suggests that the pattern observed in the data-driven model can be explained by the contact structure of the actual population.",

This is fairly different from the dynamics of the data-driven model that, mainly due to the consistently high competition in households, workplaces, and schools, shows a clear shortening of T g since the beginning of the epidemic (see Fig. S10C and D) .
