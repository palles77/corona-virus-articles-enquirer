Dr. Kale did say, \"We should, however, avoid painting all Asians with the same broad brush and doing injustice to those who are against sex selection.\" I object to the Philippines being included in either editorial. The Philippines is a devoutly Catholic country and the practice of sex selection by abortion is generally unacceptable.",

Similar findings have been described in other populations. 5 The role of emergency departments in disease transmission dramatically emerged during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 6 ",
