            "text": "Brazzein protein comes from an edible fruit, which has a long history of being a staple in the local human diet in Africa. The attractive features of brazzein as a potential commercial sweetener include its small size (53 amino acid residues), its stability over wide ranges of temperature and pH, and the similarity of its sweetness to sucrose. Heterologous production of brazzein is complicated by the fact that the protein contains four disulfide bridges and requires a specific N-terminal sequence. Our previous protocol for producing the protein from Escherichia coli involved several steps with low overall yield: expression as a fusion protein, denaturation and renaturation, oxidation of the cysteines, and cleavage by cyanogen bromide at an engineered methionine adjacent to the desired N-terminus. The new protocol described here, which is much faster and leads to a higher yield of native protein, involves the production of brazzein in E. coli as a fusion with SUMO. The isolated protein product contains the brazzein domain folded with correct disulfide bonds formed and is then cleaved with a specific SUMO protease to liberate native brazzein. This protocol represents an important advancement that will enable more efficient research into the interaction between brazzein and the receptor as well as investigations to test the potential of brazzein as a commercially viable natural low calorie sweetener.",

            "text": "Over the last 30 years, high potency sweet proteins have been identified in a variety of African and South Asian fruits. The first one discovered was thaumatin (22,206 Da) [1] . It was closely followed by monellin (11, 086 Da) [2] , mabinlin (12, 441 Da) [3] , and more recently brazzein (6, 473 Da) [4] . Although these three sweet proteins exhibit no sequence or structural homology, they appear to require the presence of charged residues on the protein surface over a noncontiguous area [5] ; [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . It is thus likely that protein sweeteners share similar receptor binding interaction sites. Among the natural, low-calorie sweeteners, brazzein is the most promising because of its superior taste quality and its physical properties. Brazzein contains no carbohydrate and bears no structural resemblance to sucrose. Recombinant brazzein is 2000 times sweeter than sucrose solution on a weight-weight comparison (17,000 times higher on a per-molecule basis) [11] .",

This species difference was exploited in the discovery of the human sweet receptor when it was found that substitution of human T1R2 in mice generated animals with humanized sweet taste preferences [12] . Two receptor gene products, T1R2 and T1R3, are required for an animal's preference for sweet tasting molecules [13] .",

We used this approach to discover mutants with sweet-taste properties that appear to be different from the wild-type protein [5] . The major drawbacks of nuclease fusion system are lack of protein solubility, the requirement for refolding brazzein, and inefficiency in removal of the fusion tag. We report here a new method based on the SUMO fusion system that supports more efficient production of brazzein. The major advantage of the SUMO fusion system is that it yields brazzein in folded and soluble form in high yield. This method of production will allow us to more rapidly produce brazzein with lower cost for both research studies and future large-scale production. By learning more about its mechanism of action and by developing more potent brazzein variants, we will be in a better position to evaluate it as a potential sugar substitute as a means for fighting problems related to obesity and diabetes.",

In an attempt to improve expression levels, we tested several other bacterial strains recommended for T7 driven expression systems. Although we observed no expression of the fusion construct from Rosetta (DE3)pLysS cells, we found increasing levels of expression from the cell series, BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)RP, BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)RIL, BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)RIPL (RP<RIL<RIPL) (Fig. 1) .",

The fusion protein was efficiently produced in soluble form and purified to greater than 90% purity by Ni-NTA column chromatography in a single step (Fig.  2) . The proper ration of SUMO protease 1 to fusion protein was determined by small-scale trials. Starting with the protocol recommended by LifeSensors (1 unit protease/10-100 \u00b5g fusion protein in the presence of 5 mM DTT), we found by monitoring the expected 6.4 kDa band on SDS PAGE that the optimal conditions for cleavage are 1 unit protease to 50 \u00b5g fusion protein at either 5 mM DTT or <0.5 mM DTT. However, the protein products produced by cleavage in 5 mM DTT and <0.5 mM DTT behaved differently on RP-HPLC. In either case, the digested His 6 -SUMO protein eluted at 34-35 min (at 58% gradient mixture), however, brazzein produced by cleavage in the presence of 5 mM DTT eluted at 29.6 min (at 42% gradient mixture) (Fig. 3a) , whereas brazzein produced by cleavage in the presence of <0.5 mM DTT eluted at 23.2 min (at 38% gradient mixture) (Fig. 3b) . Brazzein produced by cleavage at the higher DTT concentration was not sweet. With the concentration of DTT in the protease cleavage mixture kept below <0.5 mM (the SUMO protease 1 preparation contains 5 mM DTT), elution position corresponded to that of native brazzein [5] , and the protein was sweet. At this low level of DTT and with 1 unit SUMO protease 1/50 \u00b5g fusion protein, the cleavage was >90% after 60 min at 30 \u00b0C. The peak at 23 min was characterized by ESI-MS with mass of 6,366 consistent with calculated value of 6,365.8 for brazzein. The cleavage product contained small amounts of protein eluting at 28.4, and 29.7 min (Fig. 3b) ; these fractions were analyzed by SDS PAGE and ESI-MS and judged to be partially folded or incompletely oxidized brazzein and were found not to be sweet.",

We used the sequence of the minor form of brazzein isolated from Pentadiplandra brazzeana fruit as the basis for designing a synthetic gene with codon frequencies optimized for protein production in E. coli [5] . We chose E. coli for protein production, because of the ease of rapid genetic manipulation. Brazzein is difficult to express on its own, and our earlier approach for producing brazzein utilized a fusion to staphylococcal nuclease (nuclease) with an engineered cyanogen bromide cleavage site (wild-type brazzein contains no Met, and the Met residues of nuclease were removed by mutagenesis) [5] . Because the nuclease-brazzein fusion protein was expressed in insoluble form, the fusion protein had to solubilized and refolded prior to cyanogen bromide cleavage. This procedure was time consuming, and the refolding and oxidation steps required manual effort. In addition, the yield from the CNBr cleavage step was only about 50% as the result of partial oxidation of the methionine residue during the oxidation processes. The SUMO fusion system (LifeSensors, Inc.), which has been found to solubilize and stabilize difficult proteins including those with disulfide bridges [16] , appeared to offer an attractive alternative. We cloned the synthetic brazzein gene designed in our laboratory at the 3\u2032 end of the His 6 -SUMO gene. However, when we followed the standard recommended protocol, which specified Rosetta (DE3)pLysS host cells and Ni-NTA purification, the yield of the His 6 -SUMO-brazzein fusion protein was undetectable. Thus, we introduced a series of changes that led to high-level production and purification of the fusion protein. Expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli is generally difficult when the codon use in the recombinant gene differs from the codon use in the host cells. Our studies showed that the best host for expressing the His 6 -SUMO-brazzein fusion was BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)RIPL. This strain provides an increased supply of rare E. coli tRNAs (argU, ileY, leuW, and proL) that correspond to codons used more frequently by eukaryotes. These four amino acids constitute ~25% of SUMO, but much less of brazzein (Table 1) . Also, whereas brazzein has been optimized to use more abundant E. coli codons for these amino acids, the gene coding for SUMO utilizes primarily rare codons (Table 1 ). This explains why the BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)RIPL was more successful than Rosetta (DE3)pLysS, which is not optimized for these particular amino acids.",

We found it necessary to reduce the amount of DTT present from the recommended level of 5 mM to less than 0.5 mM to prevent reduction of the disulfide bridges of brazzein leading to misfolded, inactive product. The lowered DTT concentration reduced the cleavage efficiency from 100% to >90%. The typical yield of pure brazzein following RP-HPLC was about 50 mg/10 g wet cells. The recombinant brazzein after purification was characterized by SDS-PAGE for its purity, and its molecular weight was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Although the isolated His 6 -SUMO-brazzein fusion protein had a brownish cast, this color disappeared completely following cleavage and final purification. The brown color may have resulted from the stripping of Ni 2+ ions from the Ni-NTA column by reduced cysteines of brazzein.
