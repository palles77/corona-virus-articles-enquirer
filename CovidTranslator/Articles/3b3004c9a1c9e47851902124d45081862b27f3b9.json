Invasive diarrhea occurs when the infecting pathogen crosses the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Viruses, particularly rotavirus, are the predominant pathogens associated with diarrhea in developed countries, while bacteria are the most frequent cause in developing regions. [3] Diarrhea occurs when absorptive and secretory changes increase the volume of water that enters the colon to a level beyond its absorptive capacity. It almost always arises as a result of one or more of four basic mechanisms: osmotic diarrhea, secretory diarrhea, exudative diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with motility disorders. Osmotic diarrhea occurs when large quantities of poorly absorbed, low molecular-weight solutes in the lumen drive the transport of excessive water into the lumen via osmotic forces. [4] Secretory diarrhea develops in response to overstimulation of the secretory capacity of the intestinal tract. [1, 4] It usually occurs as a result of bacterial and viral enterotoxins. In exudative diarrhea, bacterial and viral pathogens destroy epithelial cells or disrupt the tight junctions of the intestinal epithelium. [4] This allows water and electrolytes, mucus, and proteins to exude into the lumen due to the hydrostatic pressure differential, where they may accumulate and cause diarrhea. Motility disorders that accelerate intestinal transit time can decrease absorption, causing diarrhea even when the absorptive process itself is proceeding normally. [4] Diarrhea is a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality despite recent advances in understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of enteric diseases. It is less well recognized that the consequences of some causes of infectious diarrhea can also include conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, malnutrition, and Guillain-Barre\u00b4syndrome.",

Mass food processing and globalization of food supplies, increased international travel, and the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria are all factors that contribute to diarrheal disease being a concern for both developed and developing countries. Although there has been a sharp decline in diarrhea-associated mortality in developed countries, it is still a prevalent disease that is associated with a significant economic burden. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of diarrhea. [5] Acute gastroenteritis is characterized by acute-onset diarrhea with or without vomiting, nausea, fever, and abdominal pain. [3] The symptoms and signs may be nonspecific in children. It is estimated that there are 3-5 billion cases of acute gastroenteritis caused by GI tract infection annually among children aged <5 years. [1] Previously, approximately 1.5 million children aged <5 years died each year as a consequence of acute gastroenteritis, predominantly in developing countries, but this figure has decreased considerably in the last 2 decades, mainly as a result of improved management of the condition. [1] As gastroenteritis is typically a self-limiting condition, the main goal of therapy is to prevent complications secondary to dehydration and its associated electrolyte disturbances and metabolic acidosis. [3] Oral rehydration salt (ORS) solutions are the recommended mainstay of treatment for acute diarrhea, and are effective on their own in \u202195% of cases of mild or moderate dehydration. [1] Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) with ORS solutions has the obvious advantages over intravenous (IV) fluid rehydration of being less costly and able to be administered in many settings, including the home. [6] In cases of severe dehydration, or where ORT is contraindicated or the patient is unable to drink, IV rehydration may be required initially, with early reintroduction of ORT where possible. Continued feeding, including breast feeding, is also important for children with acute diarrhea, and this is considered feasible as soon as the first part of rehydration is finished, i.e. not more than 6-8 hours.",

[6] Alternative or adjunctive anti-diarrheal agents that decrease the duration of diarrhea and are safe would therefore be a valuable addition in the management of diarrhea. The three main classes of anti-diarrheal drug that are used to reduce stool frequency and or volume and duration of symptoms are anti-motility agents, anti-secretories, and adsorbents. However, it is important that any drug used to treat diarrhea, particularly in children, is safe and well tolerated, especially as it is likely to be used in the home environment without extensive physician supervision. An anti-diarrheal agent should also be able to be used in conjunction with ORT, and be effective in diarrhea of different etiologies. Anti-diarrheal agents are not usually recommended for acute diarrhea in children, mainly because of a lack of consistent efficacy data supporting their use in pediatric patients, but also because of the potential for significant and or serious adverse effects associated with anti-motility or antisecretory agents. Adsorbents, on the other hand, are generally well tolerated as they are not readily absorbed systemically.",

[12, 13] In the study of hospitalized patients, infants were randomized to receive diosmectite 1.5 g every 6, 8, or 12 hours depending on bodyweight in combination with ORS (n = 32) or ORS alone (n = 30). [12] The duration of diarrhea was almost halved in diosmectite recipients (43.3 vs 84.7 hours; p < 0.005). By day 5, only 3% of infants who were receiving diosmectite continued to have diarrhea compared with 27% treated with ORS alone. In the outpatient study, 66 infants were randomized to receive rehydration plus diosmectite 1.5 g every 12 hours (n = 34) or IV or oral rehydration alone (n = 32). [13] Diarrhea had resolved in 71% of diosmectite recipients by day 3 of treatment, compared with 34% of infants receiving rehydration alone (p < 0.01). On day 5 of treatment, the incidence of diarrhea was 12% in the diosmectite group compared with 34% in the rehydration-alone group (p = 0.04). The acceptability of diosmectite was rated as 'good' by 88% of children in the outpatient study. There was a tendency for more patients in the diosmectite group to experience constipation in both studies; three cases in the outpatient study and two participants in the study with hospitalized infants had hardened stools. Two of the hospitalized infants refused medication because of vomiting, a difficulty resolved by moving diosmectite administration to the preprandial period.",

[19] Six trials (n = 1076) found that diosmectite significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea by a mean -22.7 hours (95% CI -24.8, -20.6) compared with controls. Data from two trials [19] (n = 125) showed that the frequency of stools was reduced at 48-72 hours and 72-96 hours after start of treatment with diosmectite, compared with placebo; no difference between diosmectite and placebo was evident at <48 hours. The relative chance of resolution of diarrhea on day 3 of diosmectite treatment was 1.64 (95% CI 1.36, 1.98) compared with controls, which was statistically significant; the number of patients needed to treat to resolve one case of diarrhea was 4 (95% CI 3, 5). The analyses did not detect any differences between diosmectite and placebo in the incidence of vomiting or compliance with treatment. Available tolerability data indicated only a nonsignificant trend for more diosmectite than placebo recipients to experience constipation. While acknowledging the limitations inherent in any meta-analysis, and the methodologic limitations of the included studies, the investigators concluded that the results of the meta-analysis were promising and suggested that some children with acute diarrhea may benefit from using diosmectite. However, they also cautioned that if diosmectite is to be used, then patients, parents, and physicians need to be mindful that the focus is not removed from appropriate rehydration, electrolyte, and nutritional therapies. The investigators also noted that further well conducted research is needed to determine which patients (e.g. age, invading pathogen type, outpatient vs inpatient) will gain the greatest clinical benefit, the most effective dosing regimen, the cost effectiveness or otherwise of therapy, and the tolerability of diosmectite.",

Diosmectite inhibited mucolysis and reduced destruction of the luminal surface membranes of most epithelial cells in animals infected with EPEC. Diosmectite did not influence mucus levels in uninfected animals. In anesthetized rats, diosmectite protected the adherent gastric mucus layer from pepsin-induced mucolysis when administered 30 minutes prior to pepsin challenge. [31] When given up to 16 hours prior to pepsin challenge, diosmectite was able to prevent gastric mucosal hemorrhage and histologic epithelial damage. Mucin degradation was also significantly reduced in rats that received diosmectite 30 minutes or 2 hours before pepsin challenge, but the reduction was not significant when diosmectite was administered 16 hours before pepsin challenge. Diosmectite was also found to effectively increase the thickness of the mucus layer in rats shortly after administration. The thickness was greatest at the 30-minute measurement, and had declined to 8% of that maximum 16 hours after administration. The histologic findings suggest that diosmectite mixes with the adherent mucus, rather than forming two separate layers. In addition to binding to the mucus layer, diosmectite may also inhibit the actions of pepsin, as there was evidence of inhibition of pepsin-induced mucolysis in rats that received diosmectite.",

However, diosmectite had no effect on gastric emptying when it was administered concurrently with the toxin (and with no prior incubation). Diosmectite administered on its own also had no effect on gastric emptying, indicating the effect was dependent on the presence of the toxin. [9] The fact that incubating the toxin with diosmectite in vitro prior to administration was effective in preventing accelerated gastric emptying suggests that diosmectite may be able to adsorb the toxin.

Addition of diosmectite completely restored the barrier capacity of the epithelial layer, as measured by a significant reduction in ionic conductance and mannitol and horseradish peroxidase fluxes. Furthermore, diosmectite was found to have no effect on permeability in the absence of TNFa.",

Mannitol infusion on its own disrupted gastric and jejunal cyclical migrating motor complexes, which stimulated colonic motility activity and resulted in diarrhea 45-60 minutes after the start of the infusion. When the mannitol infusions were administered 3 or 6 days after diosmectite initiation, disruption of gastric and jejunal activity persisted, but the disturbances in colonic motility were absent, and development of diarrhea was delayed by >7 hours. The investigators postulated that diosmectite probably enhanced fluid absorption by some mechanism.

            "text": "Diosmectite is available in more than 50 countries and is frequently used with good effect to reduce the duration of diarrhea. However, it is currently not recommended by the WHO for routine use in children with acute diarrhea because of the additional costs and efficacy of ORT. [39] The WHO recently recommended use of zinc as an adjunct therapy to ORT in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children. [39] To date, no studies have shown whether concomitant use of diosmectite will affect zinc absorption. However, it should be noted that because of the adsorbent properties of diosmectite it should be administered at a different time to other medications. Although no costeffectiveness studies have been published, it is possible that the additional cost of diosmectite is offset by the reduced duration of disease and length of hospital stay and time spent by parents looking after children with diarrhea. It has also been proposed that diosmectite might be useful for managing infectious diarrhea where extensive use of antibacterial agents has led to the emergence of multi-resistant organism strains. [13] The precise process(es) by which diosmectite acts to decrease diarrhea have yet to be established and appear to be quite complex. Impairment of the structure or function of the intestinal mucosa always occurs with infectious diarrhea [14] and the antidiarrheal properties of diosmectite probably include protection against damage to the intestinal mucosa by diarrheogenic agents. Current data suggest that multiple mechanisms may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect, but it is likely that the decrease in proinflammatory cytokines reported in several studies is secondary to effects that occur in the lumen. Diosmectite is not absorbed from the lumen into the epithelial cells [40] and, therefore, probably inhibits some pathogens in the lumen that induce inflammation of the gut wall. Proposed mechanisms by which diosmectite acts at the luminal level include increased thickness of the mucus layer, absorption of or binding to endotoxins, absorption of proteins and antigens associated with inflammation, increase in colonic mucin, and decreased mucolysis [11] (which may also be secondary to enterotoxin adsorption). As previously mentioned (in section 4.2), Rateau et al. [30] determined that diosmectite inhibits mucolysis caused by EPEC infection. In their study, they acknowledge that smectite may have inhibited mucolysis by adsorbing enterotoxins, thereby masking their action on the goblet cells. Diarrhea is probably decreased by the anti-inflammatory effects of diosmectite resulting in amelioration of increased fluid secretion normally associated with inflammation. Changes in the absorptive properties of the intestine in the presence of diosmectite may also alter fluid and electrolyte secretion and absorption, which may also contribute to the anti-diarrheal effects. [37] While it is tempting to deduce from these data that diosmectite acts as a physical barrier to proinflammatory mechanisms, there are data showing that diosmectite can provide anti-diarrheal activity several days after administration (by which time it would have been eliminated from the intestinal lumen), suggesting that there is also likely to be a reinforcing effect of the natural defense mechanisms contributing to the overall anti-inflammatory effect. [9] A significant effect of diosmectite on stool output was also recently demonstrated as a primary outcome in two placebocontrolled trials in young children with acute diarrhea. [20] Although not designed with this aim, these studies showed that diosmectite was particularly effective in rotavirus-positive children. This effect could be related to both the higher stool output in rotavirus-positive patients and to the pharmacologic properties of diosmectite. It may also be related to the fact that a pharmacologic effect is more likely demonstrated when symptoms are more pronounced. An additional reason may be that rotavirus itself induces a secretory process at the enterocyte level that could be counteracted by diosmectite.",

Because of its lack of systemic absorption, diosmectite is also well tolerated, even by very young children. It can be administered as an adjunct to ORT without affecting its absorption or efficacy, but antibacterial agents need to be administered at least 60-90 minutes before or after diosmectite.

Secreted IL-8 and other factors such as pathogen-elicited epithelial-derived chemoattractant (PEEC) stimulate the transepithelial migration of neutrophils to the lumen, where they target pathogens for destruction. The precise bacterial components involved in inducing an inflammatory response and the details of the signaling pathways involved have not been determined for all pathogens, but mitogen-activated protein kinases play a fundamental role in many of these pathways. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (e.g. lipopolysaccharide and flagellin) induce a response by binding to cognate toll-like receptors to elicit a response. Non-IL-8-mediated proinflammatory pathways are also present in epithelial cells (reproduced from Berkes et al.,[21] with permission). AP-l = activating protein 1; ARF6 = adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor 6; ARNO = ARF nucleotide-binding site opener; CARD4 = caspase recruitment domain protein 4; EPEC = enteropathogenic Escherichia coli; ERK = extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IkB = inhibitory protein kb; IKK = Ikb kinase; JNK = c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase; MyD88 = myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88; NIK = NF-kB-inducing kinase; PKC = protein kinase C; RICK = receptorinteracting protein (RIP)-like interacting caspase-like apoptosis regulatory protein kinase; Sip A = Salmonella invasion protein A; TRAF = tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor.",
