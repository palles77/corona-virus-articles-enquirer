For there are good reasons why the CDC and the BCCA actually prefer the patent option. First, this option provides them with more leverage in dealing with the University of Hong Kong's Versitech Ltd, which has also applied for a patent. Second, and more importantly, publishing is not enough for the two agencies to prevent others from patenting the SARS genome given their goal of preserving the public domain.",

With a patent, the CDC and BCCA can indirectly control this activity, because they will be able to impose conditions-such as making these uses and products easily available-on anyone needing access to the genome in the course of their work. They thus can use the patent system to serve the public good. 2 One could argue that the CDC's and BCCA's use of the patents actually demonstrates that the patent system is working well. What this argument ignores is that, as genomic patents increase in number, it will become prohibitively expensive for public organisations to afford not only the expense of patenting genomes and DNA sequences, but also the significant costs of entering into licences and administering those licences. Expecting nonprofit organisations to obtain patents on all their genomic inventions is not a sustainable solution to maintaining an open and free public domain.",

Thus, if we keep our eye on the target of our efforts, we soon realise that the system as currently constructed fails to meet its own objectives. As the CDC's and BCCA's efforts illustrate, researchers are concerned that patents held in private hands will decrease research, particularly for the development of clinical applications such as genetic tests. Whilst empirical data are not yet conclusive, 4,5 researchers are feeling threatened by the current system. Health-care administrators have also voiced concern that the patent system limits access to biomedical advances. 6, 7 Whatever the empirical data eventually demonstrate, there is an emerging crisis of confidence in the patent system that is in itself serious.",

Defining the public good is no more the role of patent agents or the courts than it is the role of air-traffic controllers to tell us where to go on holiday. In each case, the experts can tell us where it is safe to land, but cannot tell The prevalence of obesity in the USA has increased from around 15% before 1980 to 30% in 1999-2002. 12 Operations for severe obesity are doubling yearly in frequency and are estimated to be over 100 000 in the USA in 2003. Operations that produce malabsorption have the potential to cause, for example, protein malnutrition, iron-deficiency anaemia, metabolic bone disease, stomal ulcers, duodenal ulcers. Until more is known about the magnitude of these lifelong complications, we should consider a decrease in the use of operations that cause malabsorption and an increase in the use of pure restriction operations. 13 Laproscopic operations can be performed with minimum discomfort for the patient, which makes obesity surgery more attractive for the patient. This in turn increases the demand for surgical treatment. Avoiding a long incision is serendipitous in that the patient is avoiding the lifelong risk of giant hernia, the complication that started gastric reduction operations for treatment of morbid obesity. In addition to straining public-health administrations, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is testing out the patent system. Recent news 1 that researchers in the USA, Canada, and Hong Kong have applied for patents covering the SARS genome illustrates how the patent system is still not yet ready for the breakout of genomic patent claims. In particular, the news demonstrates that the patent system needs to be adjusted-not discarded-by governments to better reach the goal of that system: the attainment of the public good. It may seem odd that two non-profit organisations, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA), would bother patenting the SARS genome, because both want the genome to remain in the public domain, free to all researchers. As an alternative, these agencies could have published the genome, thus preventing others from being able to patent it. Instead they will eventually spend about us where we want to land. Determining our goals and ensuring that they are met is why developed countries have opted for democratic governments. Let us use them.",

Still, Stone and others propose electronic audits for patients (by pocket computer or datalogging chip). Disease arranges its own punishment for poor compliance-eg, glaucoma and blindness. Despite warnings, 42% of glaucoma patients became blind in one eye through non-compliance, and remained non-compliant with medication to save their good eye. 16 Non-compliance was the third most common cause of renal transplant rejection according to Didlake et al. 17 Maybe education, auditing, and punishment fall short because non-compliance is not simply bad behaviour. People make unintended mistakes. 18 Efforts are underway to eliminate them. 19 Even good intentions can be misguided. One of our loved ones suffered recurrent cystitis while fighting breast cancer. Antibiotics worked well. On her fifth episode, she decided to treat immediately and call her doctor later: she had bottles of antibiotic ready. Asked how she had antibiotics already, she explained that happily her physician always prescribed a 7-day supply, although her symptoms disappeared after only 1 or 2 days. What about taking a full 7-day course as prescribed, she was asked? \"You have to hoard any extra pills possible since cystitis inevitably recurs\", was her reply.",
