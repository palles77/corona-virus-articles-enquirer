            "text": "The plus-strand RNA [(+)RNA] viruses comprise a very large group of viruses belonging to many families. Among these are viruses that cause epidemic disease in humans, including encephalitis, hepatitis, polyarthritis, yellow fever, dengue fever, poliomyelitis, and the common cold. The number of cases of human disease caused by these viruses each year is enormous. As examples, dengue viruses infect an estimated 50 to 100 million people each year; most humans suffer at least one rhinovirus-induced cold each year, with the cases therefore numbering in the billions; and most humans during their lifetime will suffer several episodes of gastroenteritis caused by astroviruses or caliciviruses. In terms of frequency and severity of illness, the (+)RNA viruses contain many serious human pathogens, and we will begin our description of viruses with this group.",

These seven families also contain numerous viruses that infect other vertebrates, of which many are important pathogens of domestic animals. Large numbers of (+)RNA viruses that infect plants are also known; in fact, most plant viruses contain (+)RNA genomes. The plant viruses, however, belong to different families and are currently classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) into nine families plus many unassigned genera. Because of their importance as disease agents of domestic crops, much is known about these viruses. Other families of (+)RNA viruses include two families of bacterial viruses, one of fungal viruses, and four families of insect viruses (the nodaviruses, in particular, have been intensively studied). Thus, the (+)RNA viruses have evolved into many distinctly different families and must have arisen long ago. In this chapter, the seven families of viruses that include human viruses as members are considered, followed by a brief discussion of the relationships of these viruses to the plant viruses and what this means in terms of virus evolution.",

Nine genera of picornaviruses, five of which contain human pathogens, are currently recognized (Table 3. 2), and more will probably be recognized as further studies of the known viruses occur and as new viruses are described. A dendrogram that illustrates the relationship of the nine genera to one another, as well as the relationships of a number of viruses within the various genera, is shown in Fig. 3 .1. This dendrogram makes clear that all picornaviruses are closely related. They share significant nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity and form a well-defined taxon. The dendrogram also illustrates the rationale for grouping these viruses into nine genera.",

The picornaviral genome is a single RNA molecule of about 7.5 kb. It contains one open reading frame (ORF) and is translated into one long polyprotein. This polyprotein is cleaved by one or more virus-encoded proteinases to form more than 25 different polypeptides, including processing intermediates (not all of which are shown in the figure) as well as final cleavage products. The ORF in the genome contains three regions, called P1 (the 5\u2032 region), P2 (the middle region), and P3 (the 3\u2032 region). Region 1 encodes the structural proteins and regions 2 and 3 encode proteins required for RNA replication. The genome organization of all picornaviruses is similar, but each genus differs in important details. For example, the aphthoviruses and the cardioviruses have a poly(C) tract near the 5\u2032 end of the RNA that is important for virus replication. These two genera also have a leader polypeptide that precedes the structural protein region. The aphthovirus leader peptide is a papain-like protease that cleaves itself from the polyprotein and has a role in the shutoff of cellular protein synthesis. The function of the cardiovirus leader is not known. Hepatitis A virus, Aichi virus, and echovirus 22, representatives of three other genera, also have leaders.",

            "text": "The picornaviral genome has a small protein, VPg, covalently bound to the 5\u2032 end, which is the primer for initiation of RNA synthesis. VPg is normally removed from RNA that serves as mRNA by a cellular enzyme, but its removal is not required for its translation. The 3\u2032 end of the RNA is polyadenylated. As described in Chapter 1, the 5\u2032 nontranslated region of a picornaviral RNA possesses an IRES (internal ribosome entry site) and the RNA is translated by a cap-independent mechanism. The translation of picornaviral RNA is greatly favored in the infected cell because picornaviruses interfere with host cell macromolecular synthesis and, in particular, interfere with host protein synthesis. Infection with entero-, rhino-, and aphthoviruses leads to proteolytic cleavage of a cellular protein called eIF4G that is a component of the cap-binding complex. Cleavage of this protein by 2A pro of entero-and rhinoviruses or by the leader protease of aphthoviruses results in inhibition of the translation of RNAs that require the cap-binding protein complex, that is, capped host cell mRNAs. The cardioviruses, which are also cap independent, interfere with translation of host mRNAs in a different way, by interfering with phosphorylation of cap-binding protein. Poliovirus also interferes with host protein synthesis by cleavage of poly(A)-binding protein by the viral 3C pro , but the mechanism by which this interference operates on cellular protein synthesis and not viral protein synthesis, since poliovirus RNA is also polyadenylated, is not yet clear. In addition, 3C pro of apthoviruses cleaves initiation factors eIF4A and eIF4GI, and it is thought that these cleavages lead to a decrease in the level of viral protein synthesis later in infection, which facilitates packaging of the viral RNA.",

The catalytic center has the same geometry as that of chymotrypsin, but in 3C pro the catalytic serine has been replaced by cysteine. Moreover, in many, but not all, picornaviruses the aspartic acid in the catalytic triad has been replaced by glutamic acid. Thus, 3C pro is related to cellular serine proteases and may have originated by the capture of a cellular serine protease during the evolution of the viruses. Murphy et al.

In poliovirus, 2A pro , like 3C pro , is a serine protease in which the active site serine has been replaced by cysteine. 2A pro catalyzes one essential cleavage in the polyprotein of poliovirus, that between P1 and P2. This cleavage occurs in cis. The proteolytic activity of 2A pro is also required for other functions during poliovirus replication, the nature of which have not been established. An interesting experiment is illustrated in Fig. 3 .3 because it illustrates the power of molecular genetics and the tricks that modern virologists can play with viruses. This experiment will serve as a prelude to the discussion of the uses of viruses as vectors in Chapter 11. A poliovirus was constructed in which a stop codon was placed after the structural protein domain (region 1), so that 2A pro was not needed to remove P1 from the polyprotein precursor. The stop codon was followed by an IRES and a new AUG start codon, so that P2A and the rest of the genome could be translated from the polycistronic RNA. This virus was viable. However, when the 2A proteinase was inactivated by changing the active site cysteine, the resulting virus was dead, showing that the proteolytic activity of P2A is required not only to separate regions 1 and 2 of the polyprotein but also for other function(s).",

Thus, these two proteases in closely related viruses have different origins, and the viruses have solved the problem of how to separate regions 1 and 2 in the polyprotein in different ways. Furthermore, this finding illustrates that recombination to introduce new functions into viral genomes has been important in the evolution of these viruses, a theme to which we will refer many times in this book. Still another solution to the problem of separating regions 1 and 2 has been adopted by the cardio-and aphthoviruses. Protein 2A is not a protease in these viruses. Indeed, 2A is only 18 residues long, and cleavage between P1 and P2 is catalyzed by 3C pro . Another interesting feature of these viruses is that the cleavage at the 2A-2B junction occurs spontaneously during translation, catalyzed by the specific amino acid sequence at the scissile bond. This cotranslational cleavage occurs only during translation on eukaryotic ribosomes, and it has been proposed that no cleavage actually occurs, but that the 2A sequence prevents synthesis of the specific peptide bond at the 2A-2B junction.",

Available evidence suggests that this cleavage is not catalyzed by a protease. cDNA copies of the virus RNA can be manipulated by genetic engineering to insert IRES elements or make specific mutations. RNA can be transcribed from the clones in vitro and used to infect cells, which is possible for plus-strand RNA viruses because the first event after infection is translation of the genomic RNA. The wild-type construct pT7PVXL2 is shown in the top line. The 2A proteolytic activity normally cleaves the bond between domains P1 and P2 of the translated polyprotein. If this function is rendered nonessential, as in construct pT7PVE2A, by the insertion of a stop codon at the C terminus of P1 (solid diamond), followed by a second IRES and an initiation AUG at the beginning of 2A, virus is still produced, but forms small plaques. Thus separation of the structural region and the nonstructural region in this way results in viable virus. However, if the proteolytic activity of 2A is inactivated by mutation of the catalytic cysteine to alanine as in pT7PVE2AX, no virus is produced, demonstrating that the proteolytic activity of 2A pro is necessary for other functions in addition to the P1/P2 cleavage.

This motif serves as a template for the uridylation of VPg described before, which is required for the initiation of RNA synthesis. The description of this element as cis acting is a misnomer because the element can act in trans, and there is a pool of VPgpUpU within poliovirus-infected cells that can be used to initiate RNA synthesis. The cre element is found in different locations in different picornaviruses. In poliovirus it is found in the coding sequence for 2C, in rhinovirus in the coding region for VP1, and in FMDV it is in the 5\u2032 NTR.

One such protein in the case of poliovirus is a cellular protein called heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1 (hnRNP C1), which interacts with RNA synthesis initiation complexes and appears to be required for the initiation of positive-strand RNA. A second protein is the poly(A)-binding protein. Efficient replication of polio RNA requires a poly(A) tract at the 3\u2032 end of the RNA that is at least 20 residues in length, and it is believed that the poly(A)-binding protein binds this poly(A) tract and participates in the initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis.",

However, early experiments could only be conducted in monkeys, because the virus will only infect primates. Thus, the amount of information that could be obtained was limited, but such studies eventually showed that more than one poliovirus serotype existed. The development of methods for the cultivation of viruses in cell culture in the 1940s made it possible to screen human stool samples in an effort to type poliovirus isolates, which was necessary if a vaccine was to be produced. Such screening resulted not only in the identification of three serotypes of poliovirus, but also in the discovery of many other enteroviruses as well. The study of virology in the United States owes much to the campaign to develop a vaccine against poliomyelitis. This campaign generated a great deal of public support, which led to funding through private as well as governmental agencies, and the successful development of a vaccine reinforced this support.",

Echoviruses were distinguished from Coxsackie viruses by their inability to infect suckling mice. Currently 29 echoviruses are recognized in the genus Enterovirus.

Most poliovirus infections of susceptible humans are inapparent or result in a mild febrile illness in which cells of the pharynx and the gut are infected and recovery is uncomplicated. However, a transient viremia is established following infection (viremia = virus present in the blood), and in a small percentage (<2%) of infections the virus invades the central nervous system (CNS), where it infects motor neurons in the spinal cord and, in severe cases, other regions of the CNS. The mechanism by which the virus enters the CNS is still controversial. Current information supports the hypothesis that viremia allows the virus to enter by penetrating through the blood-brain barrier, but entry via retrograde transport in axons that serve the periphery may also be involved. In any event, infection of the CNS can result in paralysis, which can be severe enough to be fatal because of paralysis of respiratory muscles. The name poliomyelitis comes from the Greek words polio = gray and myelo = spinal cord, from the pathology caused by damage to the motor neurons in the spinal cord, which are located in the gray matter.",

The Salk vaccine, which was the first to be developed, is an inactivated virus vaccine that is given as a series of injections. Introduction of this vaccine resulted in a rapid decrease in the number of poliovirus cases. However, because the vaccine induces circulating antibodies but little in the way of mucosal immunity (see Chapter 10), it prevents poliomyelitis, the disease, by preventing spread of the virus from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the CNS, but not infection of the GI tract by the virus. The virus thus remained in circulation. The Sabin vaccine, introduced shortly thereafter, is a live attenuated vaccine that is given orally. Attenuation was achieved by blind passage of the virus followed by testing of the resulting virus in monkeys. The changes resulting from passage are now known and are shown in Table 3 .4; two changes are sufficient to make the virus avirulent in the case of types 2 and 3. The introduction of the Sabin vaccine led to a further rapid decline in paralytic poliomyelitis. This vaccine has the drawback that it induces a very small number of cases of paralytic disease, termed vaccine associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), that result from reversion of the attenuated virus to virulence. The incidence rate is about 1 per million persons inoculated, and there were about 10 such cases per year in the United States until use of this vaccine was discontinued in the year 2000 ( Fig. 3.4) . The efficacy of the Sabin vaccine is very high, however, because it induces mucosal immunity as well as other forms of immunity. It prevents subsequent infection by the wild-type virus, thus allowing eradication of the wild-type virus if coverage is sufficiently broad. In addition, it is much cheaper and simpler to manufacture and administer than the Salk vaccine (oral administration of relatively small doses of live virus versus injection of large amounts of inactivated virulent virus), making it suitable for widespread use in developing countries. Worldwide use of this vaccine has resulted in the eradication of wild-type poliovirus in the United States and throughout the Americas (the last case of indigenous poliovirus infection in the Americas occurred in Peru in 1991). Poliovirus is in the process of being eradicated in other parts of the world, although it is still endemic in areas of Africa and Asia. With the extirpation of polio in the United States, the use of Sabin vaccine was discontinued in this country and it has been replaced with the Salk vaccine, in order to eliminate VAPP.",

The original Salk vaccine was incompletely inactivated because the science of virology was insufficiently developed to assay for minute amounts of residual live virus in solutions containing very high concentrations of virus. The result was that this vaccine caused a small number of cases of poliomyelitis, but in retrospect the risk-reward ratio was favorable because of the significant decline in natural infections (Fig. 3.4) . As soon as the problem was recognized, more stringent methods of inactivation were quickly developed that resulted in complete inactivation of the infectivity of the virus, solving this problem and serving as an example for development of other vaccines. The introduction of the Salk vaccine, although enormously successful in controlling polio, also suffered from early problems when it was found that early lots were contaminated with the monkey virus SV40 (described in Chapter 7). Infection of humans by this virus appears to be benign, although there is some evidence that, very rarely, brain tumors may be associated with infection. In any event, this episode brought to light the issue of adventitious contamination of cell cultures with viruses that infect the host supplying tissues for culture. A third problem that arose during development of polio vaccines was the infection of a number of laboratory workers in Germany with Marburg virus. These workers were employed in the isolation of cells from the kidneys of wild-caught monkeys that were to be used in propagating polioviruses, and some of the monkeys were infected with Marburg virus, at that time an unknown virus. Several people died in the ensuing epidemic (described in Chapter 4).",

The number of polio cases worldwide fell from an estimated 300,000+ cases in the mid 1980s to fewer than 3000 by 2000 and subsequently to still lower levels ( Fig. 3.7) . In 2000 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that 2971 cases were reported of which 719 were confirmed by laboratory analysis. In 2001, 537 cases were reported of which 473 were confirmed by laboratory analysis, and these cases occurred in just 10 countries. It appeared that eradication would be achieved soon. The eradication campaign hit a snag recently, however, when Muslim clerics in Nigeria claimed that the vaccine could cause AIDS or infertility. In 2003, officials in some parts of Nigeria suspended local vaccination programs, and an epidemic of poliomyelitis in Nigeria resulted that then spread to neighboring countries that had been free of polio ( Fig. 3.8 programs to reestablish control of poliovirus transmission, but these situations illustrate problems that result from the continuing conflicts among societies.",

The Salk vaccine could still be used in developed countries, but it seems unlikely that routine administration of Salk vaccine would be used in developing countries. It should be possible to design new attenuated viruses for vaccine purposes that would be safer than the Sabin vaccine, but in the absence of poliovirus epidemics no drug company would want to undertake the very expensive development of a new vaccine, especially in view of legal problems that would be sure to arise.

Even wild-type poliovirus can circulate silently because most infections are inapparent. In regions where poliomyelitis has reemerged following interruption of vaccination campaigns, it has been found in some cases that the virus had been circulating for at least 2 years before reemergence.

It would be necessary to maintain stockpiles of polio vaccine to counter such threats, and in the case of the Salk vaccine this stockpiling itself could serve as a possible source of accidental escape of the wild virus. Since the events of 9/11, it is also obvious that terrorists would have no compunctions about releasing a virulent virus into the U.S. population if such a virus could be obtained.

Many paralyzed poliomyelitis patients were ultimately able to resume almost normal activities. Through a process of axonal sprouting and reenervation of muscles by the motor neurons that survived the infection, many learned to walk and use their previously paralyzed limbs. In many, recovery was effectively complete. However, a syndrome called post-polio syndrome has emerged to plague a significant fraction, perhaps 40%, of the survivors of paralytic poliomyelitis. This syndrome appears 30-40 years after polio infection and is characterized by fatigue, pain, and weakness. The weakness may be severe enough to require the use of a wheelchair. The syndrome results from the degeneration of motor neurons, but the reasons for the degeneration are not clear. The favored hypothesis is that it is the result of overuse of the surviving motor neurons, which are forced to do the work of many. A second possibility is that the surviving neurons were damaged by the original poliovirus infection and fail prematurely. A third, albeit unlikely, possibility is that poliovirus persists in neurons and is somehow reactivated, even in the presence of anti-polio antibody. In model studies using Sindbis virus infection of mice, it has been found that the virus can persist in neurons in a latent state for at least 1-2 years. There is no evidence that poliovirus might similarly persist in humans for 40 years, however, and such persistence seems unlikely. Other possible explanations for the failure of motor neurons in post-polio syndrome have also been suggested. Fortunately, paralytic poliomyelitis and its sequelae may soon be a thing of the past.",

In fact, it has now been established that most enteroviruses do cause disease, and many of them cause significant episodes of serious disease (Table 3 .5). Study of disease caused by these viruses has been complicated by the fact that there are so many enteroviruses, of which at least some have multiple strains that may differ in disease-causing potential, and by the fact that serious disease is an uncommon complication of infection by most enteroviruses (even for poliovirus most infections do not result in significant disease). This has made it difficult to ascribe any particular disease to infection by any particular virus. However, even though serious disease is an uncommon complication, enteroviral infections are very common, and the total number of cases of disease caused by these viruses is large. These illnesses include very infrequent paralytic disease essentially indistinguishable clinically from that caused by poliovirus; myocarditis and pericarditis (caused especially by the Coxsackie B viruses) that is usually subclinical but can be acute and result in significant cardiac compromise; aseptic meningitis; encephalitis; hepatitis; the common cold (perhaps a quarter of summer colds are due to enteroviruses); diarrheal disease; febrile illnesses; rash; hand-foot-and-mouth disease (a common childhood illness caused by several serotypes in human enterovirus A); and epidemic acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (an epidemic disease caused by enterovirus 70 that appeared recently and spread around the world).

Since then the virus has been found not only in Japan but also in Pakistani children with gastroenteritis and in Japanese travelers returning from Southeast Asia with gastroenteritis, and the virus thus appears to be widespread and to be one of the many viruses that are causative agents of human gastroenteritis. The virus is sufficiently distinct in its sequence from other picornaviruses to be classified in a separate genus, Kobuvirus ( Fig. 3.1 ). The name is derived from the Japanese word for bump, because the virion appears bumpy in the electron microscope. There are interesting differences in the replication of this virus from those of other picornaviruses, such as the presence of VP0 in virus particles rather than the cleaved products VP2 and VP4 (see Fig. 3 .2). The worldwide burden of human gastroenteritis caused by Aichi virus or closely related viruses is unknown at present. As described later, many viruses belonging to a number of virus families cause epidemic gastroenteritis in humans, and sorting out the causative agents is difficult and requires time.",

They cause a debilitating disease, foot-and-mouth disease, in cattle and other animals, and are economically important pathogens. FMDV was eliminated from the United States many years ago by the simple expedient of killing all infected animals until such time as the virus was extirpated. The last epidemic in the United States occurred in 1929. The virus still circulates in Europe, South America, and other parts of the world, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture maintains strict quarantines in order to prevent the virus from reappearing in this country. In the United States, work with the virus is allowed only on Plum Island in Long Island Sound, in order to prevent its accidental release. Because of its agricultural importance, the molecular biology of the virus has been intensively studied. In 2001, a large epidemic of FMDV occurred in Western Europe. The epidemic began in February in British sheep and spread to cattle and pigs in Britain and on the continent. By June more than 2000 infected animals had been detected. The epidemic was controlled by restricting the movement of sheep, cattle, and swine, and culling of herds in which FMDV was found. Almost 4 million animals were destroyed in this process. The damage to the British cattle industry was particularly distressful because this epidemic occurred only a few years after widespread culling of cattle to control an epidemic of a prion disease called \"mad cow disease\" (Chapter 9). Beginning in March, many rural areas often visited by tourists were closed to prevent the spread of the virus, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture was especially vigilant in examining travelers returning from affected countries. British authorities considered vaccinating cattle with commercial vaccines to control the epidemic, but vaccines have not been used by the British to date. Vaccination for FMDV is used in some parts of the world, but is controversial because it is then difficult to distinguish between vaccinated animals and infected animals. Thus, for example, the United States does not allow the importation of beef from areas where vaccination is practiced because it is not possible to rule out the presence of FMDV infection. Although FMDV was thought to have been eradicated by June 2001, and restrictions were about to be lifted, 16 new cases of FMDV were then found in Britain that delayed lifting of the restrictions in that country. The last new case was found on September 30, 2001, and Britain was declared free of FMDV on January 15, 2002.",

Where known, the (+)RNA genome of about 8 kb has a 5\u2032-terminal VPg and a 3\u2032-terminal poly(A), as do the picornaviruses, and calicivirus proteins share sequence identity with the picornavirus 2C ATPase , 3D pol , and 3C pro . Unlike the picornaviruses, however, the nonstructural proteins are 5\u2032 terminal and the structural protein(s) 3\u2032 terminal ( Fig. 3.11 ). Translation of the genomic RNA produces a polyprotein that contains the sequences of the nonstructural proteins. Cleavage of the polyproteins is presumably effected by 3C pro (also called 3C pro -like or 3CL pro ). In those caliciviruses that have been studied in cell culture, a subgenomic RNA is produced that is assumed to be an mRNA for the major capsid protein and, at least in one case, a minor capsid protein as well, and it is assumed that all caliciviruses produce a subgenomic RNA in order to produce the structural protein(s). There is evidence that this subgenomic RNA, once produced, can replicate independently of the viral genomic RNA. The organization of the calicivirus genome differs slightly among the genera as shown in Fig. 3 .11. In the lagoviruses and sapoviruses, the major capsid protein is in frame with the nonstructural proteins and contiguous with them. Thus, it is possible that the nonstructural polyprotein contains the sequences of the structural proteins as well, but is assumed that the major source of the structural proteins is translation of a subgenomic mRNA, although details of the viral expression strategy are still lacking. In the noroviruses and vesiviruses, the major capsid protein is in a different reading frame.",

As described, there is no cultured cell line in which to propagate the viruses, nor even an animal model in which to grow it, and studies have relied on human volunteers for virus propagation. This has severely limited the amount of information (and material) that can be obtained. However, because of the power of modern gene cloning technology, the entire genome of Norwalk has been cloned and sequenced, starting from stools of experimentally infected human volunteers. These genome sequences can be aligned with the genomes of other caliciviruses ( Fig. 3 .11), and the mechanisms of the expression of the genome and the functions of the encoded proteins can be predicted from studies of the animal caliciviruses. Thus, for example, it is assumed that the Norwalk viruses possess a 5\u2032-terminal VPg as does San Miguel sea lion virus, but to date it has not been possible to prove this. However, the genomic sequence of Norwalk virus contains a sequence related to the VPg of other caliciviruses, providing evidence that Norwalk virus RNA does in fact carry a 5\u2032-terminal VPg. Clones of various regions of the viral RNA can be expressed in cultured cells to study the expression and function of various domains. For example, the capsid protein of Norwalk virus has been expressed in insect cells and these proteins spontaneously assemble into T=3 virus-like particles of 38-nm diameter whose structure has been determined to atomic resolution by X-ray diffraction techniques. Of interest is the recent discovery of a mouse norovirus. The virus causes only silent infections in immunocompetent mice but, importantly, it will replicate in cultured cells, and thus has the potential to serve as a surrogate virus to work out details of the molecular biology of replication of noroviruses. Another recent development is the finding that human noroviruses will replicate in a cell system in which the viral RNA is introduced by transcription from cDNA clones.",

A significant fraction of these illnesses, perhaps one-third, are caused by bacteria, for which ready tests are available for use by health authorities and these epidemics have received wide attention. Until recently, however, little testing for Norwalk virus was performed. With the determination of the sequence of Norwalk RNA followed by the development of RT-PCR techniques to rapidly screen for Norwalk virus, the CDC has now attempted to assess the importance of Norwalk virus in food-borne outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Analysis of available data suggests that perhaps 50% of food-borne outbreaks in the United States are attributable to Norwalk virus, and these viruses are therefore responsible for the majority of outbreaks of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in the United States. Further, the Norwalk outbreaks are larger than those associated with bacteria, a median of 25 cases per outbreak versus 15 cases in bacterial outbreaks and 7 cases in outbreaks of unknown etiology. More than half of the Norwalk outbreaks were associated with eating salads, sandwiches, or fresh produce, and in 40% of Norwalk outbreaks restaurants or caterers were associated.

Because of their importance as disease agents and aided by the fact that alphaviruses grow well in cultured cells and in animal models, this group of viruses has been well studied. The genomes of many of them have been sequenced in their entirety. All members of the genus are closely related and share extensive amino acid sequence identity, with the most distantly related alphaviruses sharing about 40% amino acid sequence identity on average and viruses belonging to the same lineage sharing higher sequence identity. A dendrogram that illustrates their relationships is shown in Fig. 3 .17. A number of lineages or clades are present, including a clade of aquatic viruses, a clade of encephalitic viruses (EEE, VEE), the Sindbis clade (which includes Aura virus and many strains of Sindbis virus), the SFV clade (which includes many viruses which cause arthritis including polyarthritis), and a clade of recombinant viruses (the WEE lineage). The dendrogram illustrates the interesting fact that during evolution of alphaviruses, there was a singular recombination event between Eastern equine encephalitis virus and a Sindbis-like virus to produce Western equine encephalitis virus, which subsequently evolved into a number of different viruses (the WEE lineage).

The dendrogram also illustrates the fact that there have only been a limited number of transfers of alphaviruses between the Americas and the Old World. In fact, three transfers between the Americas and the Old World are sufficient to explain the dendrogram, and the majority of members of the three major lineages are restricted to either the Americas or to the Old World.

Release of the genomic RNA, which is capped and polyadenylated, is followed by its translation into a nonstructural polyprotein that is cleaved into four polypeptides by a viral protease (Fig. 3.16 ). Activities present in these proteins include a capping activity in the N-terminal protein (nsP1); helicase, papain-like protease, and RNA triphosphatase activities in nsP2; and RNA polymerase in nsP4. A viral encoded capping activity is required to cap the viral mRNAs (the genomic RNA and a subgenomic RNA) because replication occurs in the cytoplasm and the virus does not have access to cellular capping enzymes. The RNA triphosphatase in nsP2 is required to remove the terminal phosphate in the 5\u2032 triphosphate on the RNA in order to prepare the RNA for capping by the viral enzyme, the RNA helicase is needed to unwind the RNAs during replication, and the protease is required to process the precursor polyprotein.

During or shortly after translation, the full-length polyprotein precursor (called P1234) cleaves itself in cis to produce P123 and nsP4. These form an RNA synthetase, probably together with cellular proteins, that can make complementary (\u2212)RNA from the genomic RNA template, but which cannot make (+)RNA efficiently. Subsequent cleavage of P123 in trans, between nsP1 and nsP2, gives rise to a synthetase that can make both (+)RNA and (\u2212)RNA. A second cleavage between nsP2 and nsP3 gives rise to a synthetase that can make only (+)RNA. Thus, (\u2212)RNA templates are made early, but as infection proceeds and the concentration of protease builds up, trans cleavage occurs and (\u2212)RNA synthesis is shut down (Fig. 3.18 ). After this time, plus-strand RNA synthesis continues from the preformed minus-strand templates but no further increase in the rate of RNA synthesis takes place. This control mechanism may have evolved not only to make the infection process more efficient, since genomic RNA for progeny virions and subgenomic RNAs for translation of structural proteins required . At the times shown, the medium was harvested and replaced with fresh medium, and the titer was determined. The red line shows release of infectious virus into the culture fluid. For determining the rate of RNA synthesis, cells infected as for virus assay were pulsed with radioactive uridine for 1 hour at the times shown. Monolayers were harvested and incorporation into total RNA (green line) and minus-strand RNA (blue line) were determined. Adapted from Strauss and Strauss (1994) Figure 5. for assembly of progeny virions are needed in much larger quantities than minus-strand templates, but also to control the virulence of the virus. In the case of alphaviruses, it is particularly important to control the virulence of the virus in the mosquito vector. As discussed in more detail later, it is important that the infection process in the mosquito be tightly controlled, and shutting down minus-strand RNA synthesis not only prevents further exponential increase in virus replication but also allows downregulation of virus replication as minus-strand templates decay. It also has the effect that the infected cell becomes resistant to superinfection by the same or a related virus because no (\u2212)RNA templates can be made, which could be especially important in the mosquito vector. The resistance to superinfection by the same or related viruses is called superinfection exclusion or homologous interference.",

Termination at this codon produces P123, which can act in trans as a protease but cannot act as a synthetase because it lacks the nsP4 RNA polymerase. In addition to a more rapid buildup of protease that accelerates the rate of conversion to (+)RNA synthesis, this additional P123 and its cleavage products may serve to accelerate the rate of RNA synthesis.

The capsid protein is itself a serine autoprotease that cleaves itself from the N terminus of the nascent polyprotein. It has a fold that is similar to that of chymotrypsin ( Fig. 2.14B ), suggesting that it was derived from a cellular serine protease during evolution of the virus. After release of the capsid protein, N-terminal signal sequences and internal signal sequences in the glycoprotein polyprotein precursor lead to its insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (Figure 3.19 ). This precursor is cleaved by signalase, a cellular enzyme that resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, to produce glycoprotein PE2 (a precursor to glycoprotein E2), 6K (a small hydrophobic peptide located between E2 and E1), and glycoprotein E1. PE2 and E1 quickly form a heterodimer. At some time, the C terminus of PE2/E2 is withdrawn from the lipid bilayer into the cytoplasm, where it can interact with the capsid during virus assembly. During transport of the heterodimer to the cell plasma membrane, PE2 is cleaved by another cellular enzyme, furin or a furin-like enzyme, to form E2 and E3.

In one scenario, a cellular protein such as the poly(A)-binding protein binds to the 3\u2032 poly(A) tract and another cellular protein, such as one that binds to translation initiation signals, binds near the 5\u2032 end of the molecule. These two cellular proteins then interact with each other to hold the two ends of the RNA near one another.",

During transport or virus assembly, three E2-E1 heterodimers trimerize to form the spikes found in the virion. Virions normally mature when a preassembled nucleocapsid consisting of the genomic RNA and 240 copies of capsid protein buds through the cell plasma membrane to acquire a lipoprotein envelope containing 240 copies of the E1-E2 heterodimer ( Fig. 2.25C ). The free energy for budding is provided by lateral interactions between the viral glycoproteins as they assemble around the nucleocapsid and by the interaction of the C-terminal domain of glycoprotein E2 with a docking site on each nucleocapsid protein molecule. The assembled virion has icosahedral symmetry in which the symmetry axes of the nucleocapsid are coordinated with those of the glycoprotein shell by the E2-capsid interactions. The diameter of the assembled virion is 70 nm (Figs. 2.5 and 2.14A). The 6K protein is required for efficient assembly of virions. Virions that appear to be normal in every way will assemble in the complete absence of 6K but only inefficiently and virus that lacks the 6K gene produces only low yields. It has been shown that 6K expressed alone will form ion channels, but whether this is important for virus assembly is not known.",

In nature, they alternate between replication in arthropod vectors, usually mosquitoes, and higher vertebrates. A mosquito may become infected on taking a blood meal from a viremic vertebrate, which can have 10 8 or more infectious particles per milliliter of blood. The infection in the mosquito, which is almost asymptomatic and lifelong, begins in the midgut and spreads to the salivary glands, as illustrated in Fig. 3 .22. After infection of the salivary glands, the mosquito can transmit the virus to a new vertebrate host when it next takes a blood meal, injecting saliva in the process. Infection in the vertebrate begins in the tissues surrounding the bite or in regional lymph nodes, but then spreads to other organs. The infection is usually self-limited and the vertebrate is capable of infecting mosquitoes for only a brief time after viremia is established but before an immune response limits circulating virus. The necessity to alternate between two such different hosts has constrained the evolution of arboviruses-changes that adapt the virus to one host or that are neutral in one host are often deleterious in the alternate host. Thus, the evolutionary pressures on arboviruses are different from those on viruses such as poliovirus, which infects only primates.",

It is useful to distinguish between reservoir hosts in which the virus is maintained in nature and dead-end hosts in which infection normally does not lead to continuity of the infection cycle. We can also distinguish between enzootic cycles, in which the virus is continuously maintained in nature and which may or may not result in disease in the enzootic host, and epizootic cycles, in which the virus breaks out and causes epidemics of disease that may die out with time. Two types of natural transmission cycles are illustrated in Fig. 3 .23. In Fig. 3 .23A, a simple transmission cycle is illustrated, such as that of urban yellow fever infection of humans (see the section on flaviviruses later). In this cycle, humans are the only vertebrate hosts and the virus alternates between infection of a human and infection of the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. Figure 3 .23B illustrates a complex transmission pattern, using as an example the transmission of Eastern equine encephalitis virus in North America. This virus has a vertebrate reservoir consisting primarily of migratory songbirds and is transmitted by the mosquito, Culiseta melanura, a common inhabitant of freshwater swamps in eastern North America. However, the virus is capable of infecting other mosquitoes and has even been isolated from naturally infected chicken mites. It also infects mammals, including humans. On occasion, the virus breaks out of its enzootic cycle to cause epidemics of disease in pheasants, transmitted and maintained by an epizootic vector mosquito. Either enzootic or epizootic vectors are capable of infecting humans or domestic animals if they invade the areas in which these mosquitoes are present, but these hosts are usually dead-end hosts and do not further spread the virus.",

Virus activity may vary during the year, for example it may be much greater during a rainy season when the number of mosquito vectors is higher, but the virus is active throughout the year and human infection can occur at any time. However, in temperate zones in which adult mosquitoes die off in the winter, or in very dry areas in which mosquitoes are only active after sporadic rains, the virus must have a mechanism by which it overwinters. Mosquitoes survive winters (or extended droughts) by suspending development of the young at some stage. In some mosquitoes, eggs are laid but do not develop until conditions are favorable. In others, developing young diapause, suspending development at some stage of embryonic development or larval development, until conditions are favorable, such as the return of spring. Thus, one mechanism for overwintering by some arboviruses is transovarial transmission, in which the virus infects oocytes in the infected female at an early stage of development; the replication cycle of the virus is suspended during diapause and the animal develops normally. When the newly hatched mosquito begins to fly, it is already infected. One way to search for transovarial transmission in the field is to look for virus in male mosquitoes. Since these do not feed on blood, the only way for them to become infected is by transovarial transmission. Some alphaviruses are known to use this mechanism whereas other alphaviruses do not. A second mechanism used by some arboviruses is persistent infection of a vertebrate host so that infected vertebrates are present when the mosquitoes emerge once again. Some alphaviruses are known to persist in humans or other vertebrates for extended periods, but such persistence is rare and it is not known whether this could be a means of overwintering. In some arboviruses, however, such as the coltiviruses (see Chapter 5), persistence is known to be essential to the maintenance of the virus in nature and the virus has evolved specific mechanisms to persist. A third mechanism is the reintroduction of the virus into an area from regions where it persists yearround, for example, by the return of migratory birds or by infected mosquitoes being blown over large distances by storms. The whole subject of overwintering is an interesting evolutionary and ecological study, and in the case of many arboviruses, including most alphaviruses, overwintering is only poorly understood.",

There have also been suggestions that the arboviruses that first appear may not be as virulent as viruses that appear later in the season, perhaps because they are adapted to the mosquito vector and must readapt to the vertebrate host. In any event, arboviral epidemics characteristically occur in mid to late summer and early fall in temperate regions. In other regions, epidemics may be associated with heavy rainfall that results in an increase in the mosquito population.",

Some strains of the virus will invade the central nervous system after peripheral inoculation and cause encephalitis, whereas other strains of the virus do not invade the CNS following peripheral inoculation but will cause encephalitis upon direct inoculation of the virus into the brain, and still other strains do not cause overt encephalitis even though neurons may be infected.

Although most alphaviruses studied are neurotropic, only three viruses regularly cause encephalitis in humans or domestic animals. These three viruses, Eastern (EEE), Western (WEE), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) viruses, are New World alphaviruses that cause fatal encephalitis in horses. WEE and EEE regularly cause encephalitis in humans as well, although the number of cases is small (Table 3 .11 and Fig. 3.24) . The mechanisms by which the CNS is invaded by alphaviruses or by viruses belonging to other families that cause encephalitis (poliovirus, certain flaviviruses, and others) are imperfectly known. Model studies in mice have indicated that Sindbis virus invades the CNS by retrograde axonal transport from the peripheral site of infection where primary replication occurs, one of the mechanisms that also may be important for the invasion of the CNS by poliovirus (see earlier). Infection of the nasal neuroepithelium, whose neurons project directly to the CNS, may also lead in infection of the CNS. Sindbis virus appears to use this mechanism as well as transport from the peripheral sites, and transport from the neural epithelium may be particularly important in VEE infection. A third possible mechanism is the establishment of viremia followed by infection of choroid plexus , 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003. epithelial cells such that the virus replicates across the blood-brain barrier. As described, this mechanism appears to be particularly important in poliovirus invasion of the CNS, but does not appear to be used during invasion by Sindbis virus. Thus, the primary mechanism used appears to differ among different viruses, and more than one mechanism may be important for any individual virus. Alphaviruses have been used as a model system to study recovery of mice from virally induced encephalitis. The CNS is immunologically privileged (see Chapter 10) because neurons are not replaceable once destroyed, and the mechanisms used to cure the CNS of viruses differ from those used in other organs such as the liver or intestinal tract. It has been shown that humeral antibodies are required for clearance from the CNS but the mechanism is unknown. Cytotoxic T cells are also required for recovery from virally caused CNS disease, but by means of secretion of interferon-\u03b3 rather than by killing of infected cells.",

Infection is now less common in the United States, and only about 2% of humans in similar areas of California were found to be seropositive for WEE in the mid 1990s. Confirming this trend, an average of 34 cases of human WEE encephalitis occurred per year in the United States from 1955 to 1984, but this number has declined thereafter and there has been only one case in the United States since 1994 (Fig. 3.24 ). This dramatic decline may have resulted from mosquito control measures, the widespread use of insect repellents, the adoption of air-conditioning and window screens that has resulted in fewer bites by mosquitoes, especially night flying mosquitoes, and because fewer horses, which are amplifying hosts for WEE, are used in farming. No vaccines for this virus are available for widespread use, although experimental vaccines exist that are given to laboratory personnel who work with the virus.",

As a species, VEE virus consists of IAB, IC, and ID; IE, also considered a strain of VEE, will be considered in more detail later. Subtype II is now named Everglades virus and is endemic to Florida. Subtype IIIA is called Mucambo virus, IIIB is Tonate virus (of which Bijou Bridge virus is another isolate), IV is Pixuna virus, V is Cabassou virus, and VI is Rio Negro virus; most of these are South American viruses. Subtype IF (not shown in Fig. 3.25) is also a South American virus but is only distantly related to other subtype I viruses, and is now considered a separate species, named to the present by its isolate designation 78V353I virus. These eight virus species are maintained in an endemic cycle in which the principal mosquito vectors are species belonging to the genus Culex, subgenus Melanoconin, and the major vertebrate reservoirs are small mammals, primarily cotton rats and opossums. These endemic viruses are able to infect horses but replicate to only low titers in them, causing no disease and not establishing an epidemic cycle.

The epidemic began when a single viremic traveler from Australia landed in Fiji. The epidemic began near the airport and eventually spread throughout the island. From there it jumped to other islands having air contact with Fiji. During this epidemic, it is believed that humans were the primary or only vertebrate host, with the disease being transmitted from mosquito to human to mosquito without the intervention of another animal reservoir (the cycle illustrated in Fig.  3 .23A). Sequencing studies have suggested that a mutation in glycoprotein E2 may have allowed this cycle to become established. The mosquito vector during this epidemic was Aedes polynesiensis. This epidemic was explosive with most of the people on the affected islands becoming infected by the virus and about 10% of them becoming ill. The epidemic eventually burned itself out because all the humans had become immune and the virus failed to establish an endemic cycle in other animals in the region. After 20 years without RRV in Fiji, three recent cases of RRV disease have been reported in travelers to Fiji. It is thought that RRV has been reintroduced into the island on these occasions and susceptible tourists infected, but that the native population is now largely immune to the virus and no new epidemic has occurred.",

These viruses, like the picornaviruses, have a genome that contains only a single ORF. This ORF is translated into a long polyprotein that is processed by cleavage into 10 or more polypeptides. Processing of the precursor polyprotein is complicated. Cleavage is effected by a combination of one or two or three (depending on the virus) virus encoded proteases and two or more cellular proteases. The structural proteins are encoded in the 5\u2032-terminal region of the genome (like picornaviruses). However, all members of the Flaviviridae are enveloped, unlike the picornaviruses, and the structural proteins consist of a nucleocapsid protein and two or three envelope glycoproteins. Cellular proteases make the cleavages that separate the glycoproteins, but the cleavages in the nonstructural region of the polyprotein, which is required for RNA replication, are made by one or two virusencoded proteases.

This structure increases the efficiency of translation of the RNA by about 10-fold and will substitute for poly(A) in model systems. Viral proteins are not required for this effect and therefore cellular proteins must interact with this structure in order to increase the efficiency of translation. It is known that during translation of mRNAs that are capped and polyadenylated, there is an initiation complex formed that contains both cap-binding protein and poly(A)-binding protein.

They are associated with membranes and may serve to anchor parts of the replication machinery to internal membranes in the cell. NS2A has multiple functions. It inhibits the production of interferon-\u03b1 /\u03b2 by infected cells. As described in more detail in Chapter 10, the interferons are potent inhibitors of virus replication and most, perhaps all, viruses encode products to block interferon action. NS2A also has a role in the production of infectious particles from the infected cell, since certain mutations in this protein block virus assembly but do not affect other aspects of the virus life cycle. These mutants can be suppressed by changes in the NS3 helicase domain, suggesting an interaction between NS2A and NS3. NS2B also interacts with NS3, but with the protease domain. It is a cofactor required for the NS3 protease activity and the central domain of NS2B forms a complex with NS3, which follows NS2B in the polyprotein precursor.

The assembly of flaviviruses has clear parallels with that of alphaviruses, as described in Chapter 2. E of flaviviruses and E1 of alphaviruses are homologous proteins, having the same structure and function (see Fig. 2.17) . A heterodimer is first formed, between prM and E in flaviviruses and PE2 and E1 in alphaviruses. Immature virus particles can be isolated that have uncleaved PE2 or prM whose infectivity is very low. The trimeric spikes \u0394G. The 3\u2032 stemloop structure, the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 upstream AUG regions, the initiating AUG codon, and the conserved sequence (CS1, illustrated in Fig. 3 .30) are labeled. Note that the stem-loop structure just upstream of CS1 (nt 114ff) is important for initiation of translation at the AUG start codon. This figure is adapted from Figure 5 in Alvarez et al. (2005). in these immature particles are quite similar in structure (see Fig. 2 .15). Flaviviruses have a triangulation number of 3 and therefore 60 trimeric spikes each consisting of 3 heterodimers of prM and E. Alphaviruses have a triangulation number of 4 and therefore there are 80 trimeric spikes each consisting of 3 heterodimers of PE2 and E1. After cleavage of prM or of PE2, however, the structures are quite different. Alphaviruses retain 80 trimeric spikes with E2-E1 heterodimers. In flaviviruses, however, the M-E heterodimer dissociates and there is a dramatic rearrangement whereby 90 E-E homodimers are formed and the particle shrinks from 60 nm in diameter to 50 nm. Upon infection of a cell and exposure of the mature flavivirion to acidic pH there is another dramatic rearrangement and 60 E-E-E homotrimers are formed that tilt up so that the fusion peptide at the extremity of domain 2 is inserted into the cellular target membrane and fusion results. It seems clear that the structures of alphaviruses and flaviviruses had a common origin, and that recombination during their evolution resulted in this common structure becoming associated with different suites of RNA replication enzymes. It is possible that this structure, which allows enveloped viruses to have a regular icosahedral structure, evolved only once. It is also of note that both groups of these viruses are primarily arboviruses and perhaps this common structure is important for this. The flavivirus nucleocapsid is thought to be icosahedral in symmetry, perhaps having a triangulation number of 3. There appears to be no interaction between the envelope proteins and the capsid proteins in flaviviruses, however, unlike the situation for alphaviruses, so that the icosahedral structure of the nucleocapsid, if it exists, is not coordinated with the icosahedral arrangement of the glycoproteins forming the outer surface of the virion.",

Black Africans, who were brought as slaves to the New World to replace Native American slaves who had died in large numbers from European diseases, in general suffer less severe disease following yellow fever infection, presumably having been selected for partial resistence by millennia of coexistence with the virus. Their relative resistance to yellow fever resulted in the importation of even more black slaves into yellow fever zones. The high death rate among French soldiers sent to the Caribbean region to control black slaves was probably responsible for the decision by Napoleon to abandon the Louisiana territory by selling it to the United States, by which the United States underwent a huge territorial expansion. The high death rate among French engineers and workers in the 1880s under de Lesseps, who had previously supervised the construction of the Suez Canal, led to the abandonment of the attempt by the French to build a canal through Panama.

Quarantine procedures to prevent the introduction of yellow fever were often thwarted by captains who concealed the presence of the disease to avoid a lengthy quarantine, even going to the extreme of secretly burying crew members who died while in quarantine. On June 6, 1855, the steamer Ben Franklin arrived from St. Thomas and anchored at the quarantine ground. There had been three cases of yellow fever on the ship during the voyage, of whom two died and were buried, one on land and one at sea. There was yet another case on board during quarantine who died and was buried ashore. Yet when the health officer, Dr. Gordon, visited the ship, he was told by the captain that there was no disease on the ship. The captain did admit that there had been two deaths during the voyage but ascribed them to other causes. After 13 days in quarantine and continued inspection by Dr. Gordon, who finding nothing amiss believed the captain's report that there was no disease aboard, the ship was allowed to dock. Yellow fever soon appeared in Norfolk. A number of early cases among the citizens of the town were ascribed to the ship passing within a half mile of their homes, and it is possible that infected mosquitoes were blown ashore, although it is also possible that workmen visiting the ship while laid up for repairs may have brought the disease into the town. The disease then spread in all directions at a uniform rate of about 40 yards per day until it encompassed the whole city. The epidemic peaked at the end of August and died out after a frost in October. During the epidemic, an estimated 10,000 cases of yellow fever occurred in a population of 16,000, and 2000 died of the disease. The report established two other facts about the disease: Persons who had had yellow fever previously were immune, and the epidemic was not spread by person-to-person contact.",

The Department of the Army sent an expedition, under the command of Walter Reed, to Cuba, recently acquired by the United States from Spain, to study the disease. The commission undertook to test the thesis that the virus was transmitted by mosquitoes, using themselves as human volunteers. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed on yellow fever patients and then on members of the commission. At first there was a lack of understanding about the fact that mosquitoes are infected only by feeding on patients early in their disease, before an effective immune response arises, and about the necessity for an extrinsic incubation period in the mosquito, during which the virus establishes an infection in the salivary glands, before it can transmit the virus. Ultimately, however, the investigation team did succeed in infecting themselves by mosquito transmission and one member of the commission, Dr. Jesse Lazear, died of it. Fortunately, his was the only death recorded in these experiments. It is of note that in the days before the introduction of a vaccine, most researchers who studied yellow fever in the field or in the laboratory ultimately contracted the disease and many of them died.",

The campaign, which included smashing such water containers, succeeded in breaking the mosquito transmission cycle and yellow fever as an epidemic agent disappeared from Havana within months. This approach was later exported to other areas with great success, including Panama. These successes led to the belief that yellow fever could be eradicated, but the discovery of the endemic cycle of yellow fever dispelled this idea. Forest workers who cut down trees and brought the mosquitoes down from the upper canopy, where they transmit the disease to monkeys, were particularly at risk.

One such strain was derived from an infected human named Asibi. Theiler and Smith passed the Asibi strain of yellow fever in chicken cells, and after approximately 100 passages, it was found that the resulting virus was no longer virulent for rhesus monkeys. After additional passages, this virus, called 17D, was ultimately used as a live virus vaccine in humans and has proved to be one of the best and most efficacious vaccines ever developed. The vaccine virus has been given to about 350 million people. It causes very few side reactions, although three recent vacinees developed fullblown yellow fever and died. The vaccine is essentially 100% effective in providing long-lasting protection against yellow fever. This vaccine is routinely given to travelers to regions where yellow fever is endemic and is used to control the spread of epidemic yellow fever in Latin America and, with less success, in Africa. The success of this vaccine has served as a model for the development of other live virus vaccines, namely, passing the virus in cultured cells from a nonnative host. Recent sequencing studies have found that the 17D vaccine differs from the parental Asibi strain at 48 nucleotides that result in 22 amino acid substitutions. The substitutions responsible for the attenuation of the virus are not known, but it is suggestive that 8 of the amino acid substitutions are found in the E protein, where they might alter host range.",

The incidence of dengue fever is estimated to have increased 30-fold over the last 40 years and dengue viruses now infect an estimated 50-100 million humans each year. Infection may be subclinical or may result in dengue fever, which is usually uncomplicated but which can progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Uncomplicated dengue fever is characterized by headache, fever, rash, myalgia (muscle pain, from myo = muscle and algia = pain), bone pain, and prostration. The disease may be mild or it may be extremely painful (an old name for the disease is break-bone fever which dramatically describes the joint pain that can occur), but it is almost never fatal. However, progression to DHF or DSS is associated with a significant mortality rate. In the absence of medical care, mortality can be as high as 20%, but with good medical care the mortality rate is a few percent. Up to 250,000 cases of DHF and DSS are recorded each year, most of them in children, and in Southeast Asia DHF and DSS are a leading cause of mortality in children. DHF and DSS have also become important in Latin America. It is thought that DHF and DSS are caused by immune enhancement in which infection by one serotype of dengue virus expands the population of cells that can be infected by a second serotype. Many antibodies induced by the four dengue viruses are cross-reactive, reacting not only with the infecting virus but with the other dengue viruses as well. Immediately following infection, in fact, a person is immune to all four serotypes. With time this cross protection fades, and in less than a year the person remains immune only to the infecting virus, probably for life. After this time, infection with another serotype can occur and cause disease. Still present, however, are cross-reactive antibodies that can react with the newly infecting virus but which cannot neutralize the virus to provide protection. The nonneutralizing antibodies are thought to enable the virus to infect a larger number of lymphocytes by means of Fc receptors (see Chapter 10) than would otherwise result from infection only of cells expressing the dengue receptor. This expanded pool of infected cells results in increased cytokine production and can result in capillary leakage and shock. Although second infections are common, infection by a third serotype is rare. Evidently the boost to the immune system from the second infection results in an increase in the amount and avidity of cross-reactive antibodies.",

As one example, there was very little DHF in Sri Lanka before 1989 despite the continuing circulation of all four dengue serotypes.

The possibility is real that immunizing against one serotype might put a person at risk for a more serious illness. Current efforts in Thailand are directed toward developing a quadrivalent attenuated virus vaccine that would immunize against all four serotypes simultaneously. U.S. scientists are independently attempting to develop vaccines for the viruses, based either on attenuated dengue viruses or on the development of chimeric flaviviruses that express dengue envelope antigens in a yellow fever vaccine background (see Chapter 11). These various vaccine candidates are in clinical trials as of this writing. A major problem has been the tendency of vaccinated humans to respond strongly to one of the four serotypes in live virus vaccines, often to DEN-3, while responding only weakly or not at all to other serotypes.

The Japanese have long used such a vaccine to eliminate JE encephalitis from their population, and the Chinese have recently developed a vaccine that is being used in China and Thailand. The Japanese vaccine is available in the United States for travelers to endemic regions. Of considerable interest is the finding that JE virus infection may reactivate in mice after the immune system first damps it out. Reactivation in other animals may also occur and could be important for persistence of the virus in nature.",

There is no evidence that immune enhancement plays a role in the disease caused by JE virus or other flaviviruses such as MVE virus. It is interesting, however, that in a mouse model system, prior treatment with subneutralizing concentrations of anti-JE serum resulted in an increase in virus growth and in mortality in the mice following infection by MVE virus. This suggests that the potential for immune enhancement exists for other flaviviruses but does not occur in humans other than the dengue viruses because the immune reaction to flaviviruses is normally strong and not cross-reactive and subneutralizing concentrations of antiviral antibodies do not exist. It does raise a warning flag for vaccines, however, and vaccines that increase the seriousness of disease caused by subsequent infection have occurred in the case of measles virus and respiratory syncytial virus (see Chapters 4 and 10).",

In a second experiment, passage of JE virus and of MVE virus in cultured cells selected for variants that bound to glycosaminoglycans (GAG). These variants were rapidly removed from the bloodstream when inoculated into mice and were attenuated. It was suggested that GAGs present on cells and extracellular matrices result in the removal of these variants from blood and tissues before replication and neural invasion can take place.

Even so, several thousand cases of TBE encephalitis occur each year. The case fatality rate is 1-2%, with 10-20% of survivors having sequelae in the RSSE form.

Studies in cultured cells have relied upon the expression of parts of the genome in expression vectors, and more recently upon the replication of truncated versions of the genome called replicons. Replicons encode all of the genes required for RNA replication but lack the genes encoding structural proteins. Thus, only part of the virus life cycle can be studied using these reagents.

Here we note that the first line of defense against viral infection is the production of type 1 interferons (IFN) \u03b1 and \u03b2, components of the innate immune system. The NS3-4A protease of HCV interferes with the induction of IFN by cleaving two intermediates, called MAV5 and TRIF, in two different but overlapping activation pathways. MAV5 is required in the pathway that starts from an intracellular sensor of double-strand RNA called RIG-1, whereas TRIF is required in the pathway that starts from a membrane bound sensor of double-strand RNA called Toll-like receptor 3 (see Chapter 10).

The mechanisms by which this occurs are incompletely understood. What is known is that successful clearance of HCV infection in humans is associated with a strong T-cell response, both CD8 + and CD4 + , and that immunologic memory results such that although reinfection by HCV can occur, it does not lead to chronic infection. In humans in which the infection becomes chronic, CD8 + cytotoxic T cells are relatively few and these T cells recognize fewer epitopes.

Such in utero infection may lead to developmental abnormalities or runting in the calf, and may render the calf sensitive to infection by other microorganisms, all of which have serious economic effects. A more interesting effect of the chronic infection, however, is the development in some animals of fatal mucosal disease at the age of 1-2",

Data for this figure came from Meyers and Thiel (1996). years; once symptoms appear, the animal dies within weeks. Animals that die of this disease are found to be infected by two types of BVDV. One is the normal wild-type virus, which is noncytopathic in cultured cells. The second type of BVDV is a new strain that is cytopathic in cultured cells. The cytopathic BVDV strain is derived from the wild-type strain by recombination, which occurs during the persistent infection. Several different cytopathic BVDV strains have been sequenced, and they all have in common that NS2-3 (formerly called p125) is cleaved to produce NS3 (also called p80). It is the production of NS3 that renders the virus cytolytic in culture and causes lethal mucosal disease in cattle. As illustrated in Fig. 3 .37, the cleavage to produce NS3 can be induced in several different ways. In at least three cytopathic BVDV strains, cellular ubiquitin sequences were inserted (in different ways) within the sequence encoding this protein, such that a cellular enzyme that cleaves specifically after ubiquitin cleaves the BVDV polyprotein to produce NS3. Another mechanism to produce NS3 was the insertion of the BVDV N pro autoprotease immediately upstream of the NS3 sequence. A third mechanism, not illustrated in the figure, is the insertion of cellular sequences derived from a protein called Jiv.",

For BVDV to persist in nature it must be able to establish persistent infection because persistently infected animals that continue to shed the virus are an important reservoir for the virus. Cytopathic viruses are not able to establish persistent infection and come to a dead end when they arise. It turns out that cleavage to form NS3 is essential for virus replication, and cleavage occurs early after infection by all BVDV strains, noncytopathic as well as cytopathic. Cleavage is effected by a protease in NS2, and this protease, like the NS3 protease of all members of the family, requires a cofactor for function. This cofactor is a cellular protein, however, not a virally encoded protein. This cellular cofactor is the protein Jiv, which forms a stable (but noncovalent) complex with NS2-3. The amounts of Jiv in the infected cell are limited; however, and it is soon titrated out. Once no free Jiv remains, NS2-3 cleavage cannot occur and no further increase in viral replication is possible, allowing the establishment of persistent infection with only limited amounts of virus being produced. If NS2-3 cleavage continues to occur because new protease sites have been introduced or because the virus encodes its own Jiv, virus replication continues to accelerate until it overwhelms the cell and the cell dies. As an aside, it is possible that the virus host range is controlled by the presence or absence in cells of sufficient Jiv able to act as a cofactor.",

Thus, error-free replication of an RNA genome becomes impossible once the genome becomes too large. The 30-kb genome of coronaviruses may represent this upper limit. It is also possible that because the coronaviruses undergo highfrequency recombination, as described later, they may be able to accommodate these large genomes because recombination offers a possible mechanism for correcting defective genomes. Intriguingly, coronaviruses and other members of the Nidovirales encode a number of RNA-processing enzymes including a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease that could conceivably make proofreading possible during RNA replication. However, there is as yet no evidence that the mutation frequency during coronaviral RNA replication is less than that occurring during replication of other RNA viruses. The coronaviruses are grouped into three clades called groups 1, 2, 3, and examples are given in Table 3 .13.

The papainlike protease, however, has another function in addition to processing some of the sites in the nonstructural polyprotein. It is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) whose precise role in virus infection is unknown. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) are small proteins that are covalently attached to other proteins by ubiquitinating enzymes, either as single molecules or as branched chains. The role of ubiquitination is only incompletely understood but plays an important role in many cellular processes. One role of ubiquitination is to target proteins for degradation by the proteosome, a wellstudied phenomenon. Ubiquination is also involved in membrane protein trafficking, in the activation of the transcription factor NF\u03baB, in DNA repair, and in autophagy, a response to starvation in which double membrane structures are assembled that might serve as viral replication sites. Thus a viral DUB might stabilize proteins that enhance viral replication, or might be important for the induction of NF\u03baB, an important transcription factor during viral infection, or it might be important for constructing viral replication sites. There are also at least 10 UBLs derived from the same common ancestor as ubiquitin that are also conjugated to proteins to control cellular activities in ways that are but incompletely understood. One of these is the product of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15). This protein is induced by interferon and plays an unknown role in regulating the immune response to viral infection. It is not known if the viral DUB might also remove conjugated ISG15, but it is known that some other viruses target ISG conjugation. Influenza B virus produces a protein that binds to ISG, preventing the ISGlation of proteins. In addition, African swine fever virus, a large DNA virus, has a DUB that is thought to block the production of interferon by unknown mechanisms. In addition to these gene products, nidoviruses encode distant homologues of at least five cellular enzymes associated with RNA processing. These are an endoribonuclease that cleaves after uridine residues, the 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease mentioned earlier, a methyltransferase that might be part of the capping complex, an adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1\u2032phosphatase, and cyclic phosphodiesterase.

Coronaviruses encode variable numbers of such accessory proteins which are not conserved as to sequence or to number among the various members of the family and whose function in unknown.

The first mechanism proposed was primer-directed synthesis from the (\u2212)RNA template (i.e., from the antigenome produced from the genomic RNA). In this model, a primer of about 60 nucleotides is transcribed from the 3\u2032 end of the template, which is therefore identical to the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA. The primer is proposed to dissociate from the template and to be used by the viral RNA synthetase to reinitiate synthesis at any of the several subgenomic promoters in the (\u2212)RNA template. Evidence for this model includes the fact that each subgenomic RNA has at its 5\u2032 end the same 60 nucleotides that are present at the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA, and that there is a short sequence element present at the beginning of each gene that could act as an acceptor for the primer (this sequence, e.g., is ACGAAC in the SARS CoV). A recent model proposes that the bulk of the subgenomic mRNAs are produced by independent replication of the subgenomic RNAs as replicons. Such replication is thought to be possible because the mRNAs contain both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequences present in the genomic RNA, and therefore possess the promoters required for replication. Evidence for this model includes the fact that both plus-sense and minus-sense subgenomic RNAs are present in infected cells. The model favored is that the subgenomic RNAs are first produced during synthesis of minus-strand RNA from the genomic RNA. In this model, synthesis initiates at the 3\u2032 end of the genome and then jumps to the 5\u2032 leader at one of the junctions between the genes. Once produced, the subgenomic RNAs begin independent replication.",

These viruses are responsible for about 25% of human colds and are spread by a respiratory route. Unlike rhinoviruses, they cause not only upper respiratory tract infections but sometimes lower respiratory tract infections as well, which are more serious. There is weak evidence that coronaviruses might also cause gastroenteritis in humans, because there have been reports of coronaviruses in the stools of people suffering from gastroenteritis. The status of coronaviruses as human disease agents changed with the recent isolation of two new human coronaviruses, NL63 (group 1) and HKU1 (group 2A), and with the 2003 epidemic of SARS (group 2B). NL63 is an important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in both adults and children. HKU1 has been isolated from adults with pneumonia. SARS causes an atypical pneumonia that carries a 10% fatality rate. It is a bat virus that jumped to humans in China, causing an epidemic of SARS that began in 2002. In 2003 it was spread around the world by air travelers, eventually causing more than 8000 cases of human disease and almost 800 deaths. It was eventually controlled by culling of animals that served as intermediates in passing the virus from bats to humans, and by quarantine procedures. There is concern that epidemics will recur since the virus is widely distributed in China. This topic is covered in more detail in Chapter 8.",

Vaccination of cats with either structural proteins or nonstructural proteins did not protect the animals. In fact, vaccination with structural proteins made subsequent infection with live virus more severe. Persistent infection was observed in most animals, and there is evidence that virus remains even in animals that eventually control the infection since virus replication can resume if the animals are immunosuppressed.

In the bromoviruses, the capping enzyme and the helicase are encoded on one segment, but the polymerase is encoded on a different segment. The alphaviruses encode a protease to separate the three domains from one another, but the plant viruses do not. While these three shared proteins have clearly diverged from a common ancestral source, other domains within the nonstructural proteins are different from family to family. The alphavirus protease and nsP3 are not shared with the plant viruses, while the plant viruses possess movement proteins that are not shared with the alphaviruses. The structural proteins of the different families are also distinct. These observations clearly point to the occurrence of extensive recombinational events during the evolution of this group of viruses from a common ancestral source. Recombination has brought together new combinations of genes appropriate to the different lifestyles of the various members of the superfamily. In addition, the structural proteins differ among these three families so that the structures of the virions are very different from one another. The alphaviruses are enveloped, icosahedral particles (Figs. 2.5, 2.14A, and 2.25C). TMV is rod shaped (Fig. 2. 2). BMV is icosahedral but is not enveloped. Thus, recombination has brought together different RNA replication modules with different structural protein modules to give rise to the current families of viruses. Similar considerations pertain to two families of plant viruses (the Comoviridae and the Potyviridae) and the animal picornaviruses, which are all related to one another and are sometimes referred to as the picornavirus superfamily. The Comoviridae have a bipartite genome, whereas the Potyviridae and the Picornaviridae have a single molecule of RNA as their genome. Characteristics of this superfamily include the absence of subgenomic RNAs, the presence of 5\u2032 VPg and 3\u2032 poly(A) on the viral RNAs, and the production of at least one protease. The genome organizations of two members of the Comoviridae that belong to different genera, tomato black ring virus (genus Nepovirus) and cowpea mosaic virus (genus Comovirus), are compared with that of picornavirus poliovirus in Fig. 3 .42. The members of this superfamily have demonstrable homologies in their RNA polymerases, 2C helicases, and 3C pro proteases. Further, the RNA genomes have a 5\u2032 VPg and are polyadenylated, as noted. Proteases, VPg's, and poly(A) are very unusual in plant viruses, found only in members of this superfamily.

Subsequent recombination with an mRNA encoding an RNA-binding protein that could be modeled into a capsid would give rise to a very simple virus. This protovirus could then evolve through continued mutation and recombination into something more complex. In support of this idea is the fact that the capsid protein of a large number of viruses, including bacterial viruses, plant viruses, and animal viruses that are otherwise unrelated to one another, share a common fold, suggesting that once a proper capsid protein arose it was retained during the evolution of many viruses while being modeled into new shapes.",

Most RNA viruses also possess an RNA helicase that is required to unwind the RNA during replication. These helicases also appear to have diverged from a single source, but three lineages can be distinguished here as well. A third shared function in those RNA viruses with capped mRNAs is a methyltransferase gene (an activity required for capping), and two methyltransferase lineages can be distinguished.

            "text": "The second mechanism for divergence among viruses is mutation. Lack of proofreading in RNA replication means that the mistake frequency during replication is very high, on the order of 10 \u22124 . Most mistakes are deleterious and do not persist in the population. However, because the mistake frequency is so high, many different sequences can be tried rapidly because of the rapid replication rate of viruses. The net result is that the rate of sequence divergence in RNA viruses is very high, up to 10 6 -fold faster than their eukaryotic hosts. Three studies of the rate of sequence divergence in RNA viruses are illustrated in Fig. 3 .44. In these studies, regions of the genomes of viruses isolated over a period of many years were compared. The rates of sequence divergence in a picornavirus and in influenza virus (Chapter 4) were found to be 0.5-1% per year. Changes in third codon positions, which are usually silent, occur more rapidly than changes in first or second codon positions, which usually result in an amino acid substitution. In alphaviruses, which alternate between insect and vertebrate hosts, the rate of divergence was significantly less, 0.03% per year, because changes that might be neutral or positively selected in one host are often deleterious in the other host. One of the apparent paradoxes of such studies is the observation that despite rapid sequence divergence, the properties of most viruses appear to remain stable for centuries or millennia. This is due in part to the fact that although the sequence may drift, the virus continues to fill the same niche and selection ensures that the properties of the virus change only slowly. A second factor is that different domains of the genome, or even different nucleotides or amino acids, diverge at very different rates because of differences in selection pressure. Studies of the rates of divergence of viruses perforce will measure the rates of domains that diverge most rapidly. There is no fossil record to tell us when currently extant viruses might have diverged from one another, and viruses in collections have all been isolated within the last 70 years. Thus, all studies of divergence in nature examine only the divergence that has occurred within the last 70 years. Such considerations have two practical implications. Vaccines developed against most viruses .43 Genome organizations of plus-strand RNA viruses, grouped into three supergroups on the basis of sequence relationships among the nonstructral proteins. The RNA polymerases (blue), the proteinases (green), and the helicases (yellow) are each divided into three groups; the methyltransferases (red) are divided into two groups. From a relatively small number of building blocks, it is possible to arrive at the genomes of all of these viruses by divergence of individual domains and by recombination to reassemble them into different plans.
