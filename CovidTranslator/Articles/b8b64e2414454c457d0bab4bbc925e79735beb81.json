These stable and versatile subviral particles possess excellent adjuvant properties capable of inducing innate and cognate immune responses. Commercialised VLP-based vaccines have been successful in protecting humans from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and are currently explored for their potential to combat other infectious diseases and cancer. Much insight into VLP-mediated immune stimulation and optimised VLP design has been gained from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived VLPs presenting promising components of current AIDS vaccine approaches. Owing to their unique features, VLPs and virosomes, the in vitro-reconstituted VLP counterparts, have recently gained ground in the field of nanobiotechnology as organic templates for the development of new biomaterials.",

Viruses have evolved within a wide variety of eukaryotes (animals, plants, protists, fungi such as yeast) as well as prokaryotes (bacteria, archaea), those infecting the latter referred to as phages. According to the respective host spectrum, viruses have developed diverse shapes and replication strategies in order to survive and replicate within a hostile environment. However, not all vehicles assembled from virus components contain nucleic acids that are obligatory to establish productive infection. These virus-like particles (VLPs) representing empty shells are nevertheless still capable of entering target cells and are thought to be released from infected cells to entice host immune responses from the infectious viral offspring. This phenomenon has been exhaustively described for cells infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) that mass produce empty 22-nm particles solely composed of the small HBV-derived surface antigen (HBsAg). Since these HBsAg particles have been isolated and characterised for the first time [1] , fastgrowing knowledge of VLP functions and structure combined with the accomplishments in genetic engineering have revealed manifold opportunities to exploit VLPs for various fields of molecular biology. Especially their natural immunogenic properties make them attractive candidates for vaccine strategies still ranking first among molecular VLP-based applications. During the past years VLPs have also established themselves in other branches of biotechnology taking advantage of their structural stability and tolerance towards manipulation to carry and display heterologous molecules or serve as building blocks for novel nanomaterials. These nearly unlimited possibilities have popularised VLPs within the scientific community as one of the most favourite tools of today's synthetic biology. This Review will therefore discuss the role of VLPs in current vaccine concepts in the light of their distinctive immunogenic potential and highlight recent achievements in the prospering field of virosome and nanobiotechnology.",

By virtue of HBsAg to self-assemble into particulate structures, respective particles were efficiently released from recombinant yeast cells allowing high-yield production and safer purification of the vaccine [5] . Apart from yeast spheroblasts, other systems have been exploited for VLP expression. The most prevalent ones include the vaccinia virus expression system, transfection of RNA-and codon-optimised DNA into mammalian cells or infection of insect cells with recombinant baculovirus. VLPs designed for mucosal vaccination can also be efficiently produced in gut bacteria such as highly attenuated Salmonella or Lactobacillus strains [6, 7] . Besides, green plants like tobacco, potato or tomato offer an efficient and inexpensive method for VLP production by infection with plant-specific viruses, such as, for example the tobacco mosaic virus [8, 9 ] . Of note, plant-produced VLPs have been shown to be highly immunogenic upon oral ingestion of VLP-containing plant material [10].",

Since particulate antigens had been demonstrated to induce better cellular and humoral immune responses than soluble antigens, the detection that HIV-1 Pr55Gag polyprotein self-assembles into particulate spheres provided a new rationale for generating a Gag-based VLP vaccine [15, 16] . Gag is today one of the two most common antigens expressed for vaccine approaches, and respective VLPs can be efficiently produced in mammalian or insect cells ( Figure 1C ). First immunisation analyses with Gag VLPs yielded strong Th1-biased humoral and cellular immune responses in the absence of adjuvants and induced Gagspecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in mice and macaques [17, 18] . Today it is a widely held belief that both, a strong cell-mediated immune response and crossreactive neutralising antibodies mainly directed towards conserved epitopes of the envelope (Env) protein are essential to achieve protection from HIV infection. Hence, current approaches are being extended to novel VLP designs addressing both aspects to induce an integrated immune response.",

In this regard, not all attempts to use VLPs built of structural proteins derived from the cognate virus have yet been successful in eliciting effective immune responses. To allow further reconfiguration of the native structures and adaptations in VLP design, the self-assembling antigens such as HIV Gag, HBsAg and HBcAg (hepatitis B core antigen), parvovirus VP2 capsid protein or p1 protein of yeast transposon Ty have been extensively studied in order to identify domains dispensable for particle formation to clear a space for insertion of more relevant sequences. In case of HIV-1 Gag, parts of the matrix and capsid proteins or the carboxyl-terminal p6 moiety can be deleted without affecting particle assembly and then be replaced by or fused with heterologous sequences either derived from other regions of the cognate virus or from a foreign virus, thereby allowing efficient display of corresponding epitopes in the Gag particle context. Since multi-epitope vaccines have been shown to be more successful in inducing broad immune responses, Gag-based VLPs were soon extended to contain larger regions of the virus, and thus present more epitopes to the immune system. In this respect, the discovery that HIV full-length Gag-Pol precursors comprising additional enzymatic activities were also capable of forming particles was very helpful to develop a second generation of multi-epitope VLPs ( Figure 1B ).",

Last but not least, VLPs pseudotyped with heterologous Envs can be simply used as platforms to efficiently present the incorporated Env proteins to the immune system. As an example, Gag VLPs pseudotyped with equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1)-derived glycoprotein gp14 elicited protective immune responses against EHV-1 challenge in mice upon intranasal application [23] emphasising the immunogenic potential of particulate antigens.",

Compared with soluble antigens, DNA vaccines are easier to produce and deploy the positive effects of live attenuated vaccines to directly stimulate MHC class-I restricted CTL responses. Support for this hypothesis has been provided in a recent study published by Bellier et al. [26] . The authors demonstrated efficient expression of murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag-Env VLPs from plasmid DNA in vitro and used these plasmo-retroVLPs to induce strong specific CTL responses towards displayed T cell epitopes, protecting mice from lethal virus challenge. Currently, VLPs are an inherent part of most multi-component status quo HIV vaccines, and one promising concept shown to induce broad long-lasting immune responses is a combination of DNA/VLP prime followed by booster immunisation with live attenuated vaccinia vectors [27] . We and others have previously summarised the recent achievements on the way towards a potent VLP-based HIV vaccine [3, 4, 19 ] .",

VLP size appears to be favourable for uptake by dendritic cells (DC) via macropinocytosis and endocytosis that play a central role in activating innate and adaptive immune responses. A growing body of data indicates that Gag VLPs that per se contain many immunogenic epitopes are capable of stimulating cellular immune responses via both, the MHC class-I and MHC class-II pathway [19 ] (see also Figure 2A ). Owing to the repetitive particle structure, uptake of a single VLP feeds thousands of contained epitopes into the processing and presentation machinery of APCs, a process thought to be supported by the fusogenic activity and the lipid nature of VLPs. These assumptions are in line with recent findings that pseudotyping of VLPs with envelope proteins like VSV-G, thereby improving uptake via receptor-dependent fusion, increases epitope presentation via the exogenous MHC class-I pathway and subsequent CTL induction [21, 29] .",

            "text": "In principle, all established VLPs proved to be strong stimulators of the innate immune system. The extensive potential of VLPs to activate and mature DCs thereby triggering the expansion of numerous populations of immune cells in vivo has recently been diligently investigated by Sailaja and et al. [30 ] . However, VLPs used in this study were produced in the baculo-expression system. Actually, increasing evidence suggests that contaminating components in VLP preparations might play a crucial role in stimulating both, innate and cognate immune responses. The majority of VLP preparations currently applied are derived from infection of insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses (BV), which are popular owing to their power regarding expression of heterologous proteins, their incapability to replicate in mammalian cells, a low cytotoxicity and the absence of a pre-existing immunity in humans. Routine purification procedures like crude gradient centrifugation or ultrafiltration do not strictly discriminate between VLPs and BVs. As a consequence, VLP preparations are probably enriched by BVs potentially contributing to the adjuvant properties of VLPs (illustrated in Figure 1C ). Indeed, wild-type BVs have been reported to induce strong innate immune responses upon intranasal inoculation capable of protecting mice from lethal challenge with influenza virus [31] . The associated secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukins (IL)-6 and-12, and type 1 interferons (IFN-a/-b) was shown to be at least partly induced via the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)/MyD88 signalling pathway known to recognise internalised CpG-rich DNA from bacteria [32] . Indeed, it has been reported that BV DNA probably released into the cytoplasmic compartments containing TLR9 upon gp64-mediated membrane fusion has a CpG content similar to bacteria, which might be regarded as a danger virus-like particles Ludwig and Wagner 541 signal. However, residual IFN-a release upon BV stimulation in TLR9/MyD88 knockout mice indicated that other possible mechanisms might be involved in BVmediated immunogenicity, as has been suggested for the surface glycoprotein gp64 owing to its distinct N-glycosylation pattern. A model for BV-mediated DC stimulation is provided in Figure 2A . The adjuvant properties of BV have been corroborated by recent findings showing that BV-induced humoral and CTL responses against co-administered antigens were triggered via IFNa and b, which directly mature DCs thereby driving the differentiation of B and T cells into effector and memory cells [33 ] ( Figure 2B ). In further support of this hypothesis, BV-produced HIV VLPs formerly demonstrated to elicit strong immune responses in Balb/c mice [34] were recently shown to mature monocyte-derived DCs associated with significant upregulation of surface maturation markers (CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, HLA-DR) and increased release of Th1-and Th2-specific cytokines [35] . Apart from BV-derived VLP preparations, specific immunomodulatory effects have also been ascribed to yeast-derived particles, which have been shown to enter DCs via mannose recognition resulting in cross-priming of Gag-specific CD8 + T cells [36] . In sum these data suggest that the respective system used for VLP production might significantly influence direction and outcome of the induced immune response. Albeit the described adjuvant properties of contaminating baculovirus-or yeast-derived components might substantially trigger the overall immunogenicity of VLP preparations, the development of such a vaccine raises fundamental safety concerns considering the associated regulatory complications. Basically, advanced procedures for production and notably purification of VLPs will be needed to obviate these unforeseeable side effects.",

Very recently, VLPs assembled from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-coV)-derived S, M, and E proteins have been reported to elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, thus providing a promising strategy to confine SARS in the near future [39] . On the basis of the accumulating knowledge of VLP function and the importance of diligent VLP design to perform in a vaccine setting, old VLP formulations, such as rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) particles, protecting rabbits from the cognate virus infection, are being discovered for new pur-poses. RHDV VLPs chemically modified to allow covalent conjugation of peptides and proteins have lately been shown to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses towards the attached antigens [40] . This illustrates the potential virtue of combining biological and chemical techniques to overcome restrictions in size or accessibility of VLP-inserted epitopes.",

HA stabilises the liposomal particles mainly composed of phospholipids and phosphatidylcholine and binds to sialic acid expressed on APCs, thus allowing receptor-mediated fusion followed by subsequent presentation of integrated antigens via MHC class-I and surface-exposed antigens via MHC class-II. IRIVs are part of licensed hepatitis A virus and influenza vaccines and have been shown to efficiently boost humoral and cellular immune responses towards all kinds of integrated antigens such as tumour markers, malariaspecific peptides, Leishmania-derived carbohydrates or toxoids [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . Even cytotoxic drugs, like doxorubicin are efficiently delivered to tumour cells by virosomes displaying polyethylene glycol-conjugated receptorspecific antibodies that might pave the way for novel cancer therapy strategies [48] .",

Alternatively, strong CTL responses demonstrated to be crucial for tumour growth control could be induced by means of recombinant IRIVs specifically targeted to plasmacytoid DCs [51] . Apart from representing antigen delivery and display platforms, virosomes are excellent carriers of nucleic acids that form stable complexes with the liposome spheres. Cusi et al. [52] have formerly shown that virosome-mediated targeting of mumps virus DNA to APCs induces specific CTL responses suggesting efficient expression and presentation of the encoded mumps antigens. To protect the active DNA component from cellular nucleases, De Jonge et al. have recently developed a method to encapsulate plasmid DNA into virosomes via a short-chain phospholipid [53 ] . Another innovative approach has used virosomes to channel therapeutic siRNA complexed with cationic lipids into target cells [54] .",

Especially the capability of virus-derived nanostructures to assemble into highly organised regular arrays together with their susceptibility to accept a wide range of chemical modifications has offered new perspectives for the usage of VLPs in manifold biotechnological processes. Wang et al. have formerly exploited the possibility to chemically modify mutant cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles -which are highly stable and offer multiple reactive sites -by exposing sulfhydryl groups in order to attach fluorescent dyes and gold clusters [56] . CPMV was also shown to efficiently self-assemble into monolayers at perfluorodecalin-water interfaces, which can be cross-linked to form a robust membrane [57] . Likewise, the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-derived capsid protein has proven to be a suitable scaffold for extensive chemical modification allowing assembly of nanobiopolymers (summarised in reference [9 ] . Yet another study has described the usage of recombinant M13 phage particles as organic templates to polymerise nanowires as building blocks for semiconductors or magnetic materials [58] . Likewise, the need for new nanowire material for the construction of smaller lithium ion batteries has drawn the attention to filamentous M13 phages, which were modified to surfaceexpose tetraglutamate to nucleate metal ions such as the lithium active compound cobalt oxide [59] . In all these approaches, chemically modified VLPs maintained their structural integrity that is a prerequisite for VLPs to prevail in the future world of nanoscience.",

VLPs are taken up by DCs via endocytosis (1) directing antigen processing in late endosomes (LE) and presentation via the MHC class-II pathway (red path), or via receptor (R)-mediated fusion triggered by gp64 (2a) resulting in proteasomal antigen processing in the cytoplasm and subsequent presentation on MHC class-II (blue path). Baculoviruses (BV) are taken up by gp64-mediated fusion (2b). Danger signals from CpG-rich BV-DNA are recognised by endosomal (E) Toll like receptor 9 (TLR9) and transmitted via a MyD88-dependent (a) or independent (b) signalling pathway resulting in activation of transcription (Tk) and production of inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferons. A TLR9-independent route of DNA recognition inducing production of IFN-a has also been described (c). Additionally, BV-derived components other than DNA might contribute to DC activation (d). G, Golgi; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NC, nucleus; P, proteasome; TV, transport vesicle. (B) VLP-mediated maturation of DCs. Uptake of VLP/BV activates DC via danger signals resulting in upregulation of DC maturation markers. Mature DCs present VLP-derived antigens to naive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells via MHC class-I and class-II. Secretion of cytokines by DCs stimulates differentiation into B and T effector cells resulting in antibody release and cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses.",

For this purpose, the authors have created a recombinant VLP displaying the cellderived HIV-specific CD4 receptor complex and carrying thymidine kinase (TK) of herpes simplex virus-1, which has proven to be highly cytotoxic under ganciclovir treatment causing chain termination during replication. This TK is delivered by VLPs via an inverse fusion process to latently infected cells that express HIV proteins and surface-expose Env upon cytokine stimulation, resulting in efficient cell killing.
