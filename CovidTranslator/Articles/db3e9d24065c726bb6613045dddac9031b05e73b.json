However, providers often forget or choose not to wear face protection in situations in which it is indicated. 2,3 In December 2013, our infection prevention and control department received several phone calls from unit staff after exposure to a patient with possible Neisseria meningitidis. These providers had performed open suctioning on the patient without wearing face protection, before the potential diagnosis was considered. Based on this experience, we sought to identify the barriers to the use of face protection as part of standard precautions.",

A common barrier cited was the lack of readily accessible supplies at the point of care. In our facility, the variability in patient room and unit design makes it difficult to identify a single standard location that providers could associate with finding goggles or face shields. Most respondents felt that equipment should be available either in the patient's room or just outside the room with other precautions supplies, such as gowns and gloves. It is important for hospital infection prevention programs to recognize that if face protection supplies are not available at every bedspace or room, a substantial proportion of providers may choose to omit using face protection in situations in which it is indicated. 4, 5 In addition, our survey revealed that face protection was perceived by many providers as unnecessary, despite our inclusion of education about standard precautions as part of our hospital's required annual computer-based training for all clinicians.",

We did not attempt to verify self-reported responses about the use of face protection, and we do not know whether nonrespondents would have answered differently. In addition, social desirability bias may have influenced the responses. Despite these limitations, it seems clear that more detailed education is warranted for clinicians about specific situations in which standard precautions should be used. Clinicians may be making a judgment that open suctioning poses no risk of splashing or spraying; if so, it is important to elicit such opinions to initiate a meaningful discussion about the potential benefits of face protection. The choice to omit face protection may also reflect the inconvenience of wearing goggles or a face shield during clinical care, as some of our respondents noted. Offering multiple design options and including frontline staff in decisions about product selection may help ameliorate these concerns somewhat, but ultimately the decision to use face protection will be made by individuals based on their assessment of risks versus benefits. The role of the infection prevention program should be to ensure that reasonable options are easily accessible and that providers fully understand the potential risk of transmission of infection at the time they make their decision.
