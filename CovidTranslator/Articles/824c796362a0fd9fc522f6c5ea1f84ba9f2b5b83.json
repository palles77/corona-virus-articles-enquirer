What is clear for now is that the mode of transmission is through contact and in the form of droplets 1 although airborne transmission has not been ruled out. Since late January 2020, the Chinese authorities recommended that people go to crowded places as little as possible to avoid cross-infection. On the other hand, people's fear of COVID-19, because of its novel and rapid transmission, make them reluctant to go to public places including medical and dental hospitals. The literature shows that many dental procedures produce aerosols and droplets that are contaminated with bacteria, viruses, and blood, and have the potential to spread infections to dental personnel and other people in the dental office. 5 The health authorities of some cities in China ordered the dental institutions to suspend general non-emergency dental treatment while providing emergency dental services only.

We observed significant utilization reductions in emergency dental services at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic. The results strongly suggest that COVID-19 significantly influenced people's dental care-seeking behavior. As most of the routine dental care was not available during the epidemic, more patients were expected to seek emergency dental service when it was needed. However, according to the Chinese authorities' recommendations and fearing of epidemics, people are reluctant to go outside but stay in house, with less willing to go to dental institutions. As a result, the overall dental emergency patients count reduced by 38%. However, the previous study showed that there was a potential risk for transmission of acute viral respiratory tract infections in the dental office because of aerosol production during certain dental procedures. 5 Although the number of patients was reduced, it took a strongly prolonged time for the dental institution to carry out strict infection control measures. Consequently, the emergency center was unprecedented stressed. It was necessary to increase the dental units to meet the patients' need for emergency dental services.",

According to a previous study, women sought dental emergency care significantly less often than men, and the ratio was reversed for non-emergency dental service. 6 In the present study, the ratio was 43.3% females to 56.7% males during the epidemic and 52.5% females to 47.5% males pre-COVID-19 (Table 1 ). It might be attributed that females were more apprehensive about undergoing dental treatment procedures because of acute viral respiratory tract infections than their male counterparts. 7 Meanwhile, the present study observed some patients who were not in an emergency (18.3%) went to the dental emergency center before the COVID-19 epidemic. That could be attributed that the dental emergency center is convenient to care accessibility for a population with difficulty in accessing general dental services, and the basic dental fees are the same regardless of the type of practice (elective/urgency) in China. The free walk-in services may encourage consultations for nonurgent reasons. 8 In contrast, most of the visitors (94.6%) during the epidemic were in an emergency. However, the present study didn't evaluate the cases by urgency levels which may affect people's demand for dental services at different periods.",
