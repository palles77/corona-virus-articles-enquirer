Temporal analysis using time series algorithms is a conventional approach due to its simplicity when compared with spatial algorithms, which require additional geographical information. One of the algorithms, the wavelet anomaly detector (WAD) algorithm [4] developed by the University of Pittsburgh, is used in the Realtime Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) system. It computes a score for each unit (e.g., ZIP code) area based on how many standard deviations that the number of the cases from that area in the most recent day is elevated from the expected, and then reports all the areas with higher-thanthreshold scores. Some other algorithms applying temporal analysis have also been explored in [5, 6, 7] .",

There are two approaches for spatial and tempo-spatial algorithms: the frequentist approach and the Bayesian approach. A representative algorithm using frequentist approach is the spatial scan statistic (KSS) developed by Kulldorff et. al. in 1997 [8] , which scans the region of interest for clusters using circular windows of various sizes. Each scanning window may cover a number of ZIP code areas and is considered as a cluster candidate. This frequentist approach uses a likelihood-ratio test, a statistical test used to compare the fit of two models: the null hypothesis (no outbreaks in a region) model and the alternative hypothesis (an outbreak in a region) model, to find a window (cluster) with maximum likelihood ratio. The derivatives of KSS include the elliptic spatial scan statistic and the flexible spatial scan statistic (FSS), which are derived by relaxing the constraint of a circular cluster shape (window) [9, 10] .",

Each window can comprise one or more grid cells and is considered as a potential cluster. The algorithm identifies the outbreak cluster with the highest posterior probability of having an outbreak.

First, the RODS disease surveillance system signaled enormous spikes in the time series data of over-the-counter (OTC) thermometer sales in Texas at the end of April corresponding to the chronology of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (Fig. 2) . Second, we found a strong correlation (correlation coefficient is 0.91 with 95% confidence interval [0.89,0.92]) between patients with constitutional syndrome visiting emergency departments (EDs) and OTC thermometer sales in Pennsylvania in the past flu seasons as shown in Fig. 3 . Finally, Villamarin et al. also demonstrated high correlation (0.89) between actual and predicted ED visits using thermometer sale data [26] . Although we conducted a retrospective study, a prospective analysis was mimicked by incrementally adding each day's data to the algorithms as during the evaluation period. For each day, the algorithms use previous 730 days to predict the current day's sales and estimate the values of prior parameters (e.g., 's and 's in Gamma distribution used in the Bayesian spatial detection algorithm). In order to define the alert threshold, , used by the detection algorithms, we applied the analysis to each of the 365 days between April 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 and recorded the highest score for each day. This allows us to calculate the false alarm rate as 365 \u2044 if is the -th greatest in the set of 365 recorded scores. The assumption here is that during the 3-year period before April 1, 2009, there were no H1N1 pandemics. But note that the ignored other strains of flu that did occur in this period will result in an underestimation of algorithm performance. Figure 4 shows the accumulation of confirmed H1N1 cases in Texas after April 23, 2009 (when CDC started counting cases) as posted on CDC's official website [16] . Within about 3 weeks, the H1N1 virus spread quickly and infected more than 500 people in Texas. On the same day, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that 7 of the 14 Mexican samples contained the same virus strain as that found in California and Texas and suggested that the containment in the USA was \"not very likely\" [28] . Another appropriate date can be considered as the pandemic onset is the date when the first case was confirmed in Texas. Since we are comparing the relative timeliness between different detection algorithms, the absolute difference between each algorithm and the real onset date will not affect our findings.",

The baseline (expected count) for each ZIP code was estimated using a wavelet transform from the previous two years of data (as used in WAD). By assuming a uniform prior distribution, this approach computes the posterior probability of having an outbreak using the Gamma-Possion model we described earlier in the section. The cluster with the highest posterior probability is reported if it exceeds a threshold, which is estimated based on a preset false alarm rate described in the subsection of Study Dataset. We examined the detection timeliness of both the WAD (Wavelet anomaly detector) and the BSS (Bayesian spatial scan statistic) algorithms, respectively. We chose two false alarm rates: one false alarm per two months and one false alarm per month, allowing us to evaluate the two algorithms from a practical perspective as resources are limited to public health officials. The false alarm rate reflects how often an alarm is triggered by chance, assuming that analyses are repeated on a regular basis with a periodicity equal to the specified time interval length, e.g., on a daily basis.",

In addition, Fig. 6 shows the geographical distribution of the ZIP code areas with significantly elevated thermometers sales from April 25, 2009 to April 30, 2009, using the same color scheme to represent the two significance levels. As shown in both figures, the number of significantly elevated ZIP code areas stayed low (less than 20 ZIP codes) before April 27. From our past experience, the spikes shown in these areas probably resulted from an imperfect data collection process or from some other stochastic reasons (e.g., non-continuous data reporting from some stores) since the spikes are distributed randomly and only last for a day (see Fig. 6 (a), 6(b)). However, starting from April 27, 66 ZIP code areas simultaneously signaled alarms. Furthermore, the thermometer sales stayed significantly high for several days, until around May 7, and the number of significantly elevated ZIP codes exceeded 100 on April 29 and April 30 (in Fig. 6 (cf)). More specifically, the same ZIP codes in the counties Nueces, Travis, Bexar, Collin, Dallas and later El Paso, Bowie, Tarrant and Cameron, repeatedly reported significantly elevated thermometers sales within those days. These results suggest that WAD was able to detect the significant increase on April 27, 2009, by identifying 66 ZIP code areas in about 20 counties showing a significantly elevated amount of thermometer purchases from those drug stores under surveillance. BSS, on the other hand, showed different results from WAD when analyzing the same set of data. The first day BSS fired an alarm was April 30, 2009 which was 3 days later than WAD did. It reported a cluster including 409 out of total 581 ZIP codes with the posterior probabilities above the threshold corresponding to one false alarm per month ( Fig. 7(a) ). The cluster was located in the eastern central part of Texas. On the next day, May 1, 2009, BSS fired the 2 nd alarm with a cluster comprising 272 ZIP codes with significance of one false alarm per two months ( Fig. 7(b) ). Fig. 7 shows that the cluster had become more localized and moved to the southeast. However, during the first 6 days of the real outbreak, from April 24, 2009 to April 29, 2009 , BSS did not identify any significant cluster. It is also worth noting that after May 1, although the counts of thermometers sales were still high, BSS did not fire any alarms at all for the rest of days within the evaluation period (except for May 5, when a 3 ZIP code cluster was found but was believed to be a false alarm).",

The slow timeliness of BSS in this study compared with WAD can be attributed to the violation of the basic assumption that only one outbreak cluster can occur at the same point in time in different geographic regions. Therefore, in order to rapidly detect a pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak, which takes place in multiple distant places in a sudden and simultaneous way, our results show that the spatial models with the one-cluster assumption are not preferred. However, although the time series algorithm, WAD, was able to respond 3 days earlier than the Bayesian spatial algorithm, BSS, which suggests the time series algorithms are more sensitive to pandemic detection, it also has a few drawbacks. Time series algorithms are less robust on noisy data (e.g., caused by imperfect data collection process, etc.) since they signal alarms whenever the deviation of the observed counts from the expected counts in an area exceeds a threshold. Thus, a secondary analysis is recommended to be performed. A secondary analysis may include 1) considering the output for the previous days as well to determine if the newly alarmed areas are correlated with the previous ones; 2) studying if there is a data quality problem that may cause an abnormal increase of sales; and 3) waiting for the outcome from the next time period to make better decision.",

Our experimental design was restricted to analyzing only one type of data (i.e., the OTC thermometer sales) due to data availability. Some public health organizations or biosurveillance systems, however, may have more than one possible data source (e.g., emergency department patient visits, etc.) available, which to some extent may contain better signals of H1N1 pandemic. Also it would be ideal to analyze multiple states of data and to use ED data to create a better gold standard in terms of deciding outbreak onset period. We hope in the future to use ISDS distribute project data for a larger scale study. Furthermore, the comparison in this study was only performed between one spatial algorithm and one time series algorithm. Evaluation using other algorithms (e.g., moving average, the spatial scan statistic, etc.) would be helpful to support our findings. In addition, this study only used one known H1N1 pandemic to test the performance of the two algorithms; thus confidence interval for timeliness is not available.",

Although the spatial algorithm was more robust (fewer false alarms) and informative (suggesting geographical distribution of outbreaks) than the pure time series algorithm, our results suggest that the time series analysis is still desirable in detection of pandemics as it may achieve a more sensitive performance with better timeliness. The use of time series algorithms, therefore, is still necessary for rapid outbreak detection, especially in scenarios where the singlecluster assumption does not hold. Instead of replacing the time series algorithms, we suggest epidemiologists or biomedical informaticians apply time series algorithms as a complement to current spatial algorithms for public health surveillance purposes.",
