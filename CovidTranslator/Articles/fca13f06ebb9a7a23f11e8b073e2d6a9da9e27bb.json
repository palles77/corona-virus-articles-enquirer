The successful management of emergency situations requires proper planning, guided response, and well-coordinated efforts across the emergency management life cycle. Literature suggests that emergency management efforts benefit from well-integrated knowledge-based emergency management information systems (EMIS). This study presents a systematic review of papers pertaining to the application of knowledge-driven systems in support of emergency management that have been published in the last two decades. Our review presents two major findings. First, only limited work has been done in three EMIS-knowledge management system (KMS) subdomains: (i) definition, (ii) use, and (iii) methods. Second, only limited research has been done in embedding roles in KM systems. We highlight role alignment to the 12 fundamental roles, as called for by Turoff et al. (2004) , in the context of creating dynamic systems in aid of emergency management efforts. We believe that these two findings warrant the attention of the research community.",

Disaster management involves activities such as mitigation, risk reduction, prevention, preparedness, response and recovery [5] . Managing disaster is vital as it threatens organizational goals and permanently impairs the earning power [6, 7] . Prominent issues in disaster management are the need for common platform to enable seamless flow of information and lack of integrated system to support emergency activities.",

            "text": "Over the last decade alone (2000 to 2010), the average death toll rose sharply due to the increasing frequency of disasters, especially in developing countries. The United Nations reported that in 2010 alone, 373 earthquakes, floods, cyclones, volcanic eruptions, and droughts occurred, which affected 208 million people around the world, killing nearly 300,000, and costing US $110 billion in losses [8, 9] . Earthquakes in Haiti (12 January), Chile (27 February) , and China (13 April), flooding in Pakistan (July to September), and heat wave in Russia (July to September) were the five most devastating natural catastrophes in 2010, which claimed 280,000 lives and US$52 billion worth of losses [10] . A World Vision report rationalized these phenomena by quoting climate change as a new driver of disaster risk, which increases both hazards and vulnerabilities [11] . Although stopping disasters from occurring is impossible, being prepared with the right knowledge and information on disasters is possible. [15, 16] \u2022 Information Management System -IMASH for Hurricane Disasters [17] \u2022 Digital Typhoon, a KMS to provide information for typhoons [18] \u2022 PeopleFinder and ShelterFinder [19] \u2022 Strong Angel III (2006), United Nations Development Program [9] \u2022 Tsunami Resource and Result Tracking Systems [20] \u2022 Case Management Systems in Singapore used during SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) [21, 22] \u2022 NIMS (National Incident Management Systems) in USA [23] \u2022 DesInventar System, a historical disaster database and postdisaster damage data collection tool, a project by UNDP and countries such as Latin America, Orissa and South Africa are currently using this system [24] [25] [26] \u2022 Google's Person Finder Tool (launched in 2010) that helped in registering and locating earthquake survivors in Japan (2011), Christchurch (2011) and Haiti (2010) [27] . [28] referred to knowledge as a 'justified personal belief' that directly linked with personal capacity of an individual to take effective action. Knowledge can be tacit or explicit [29] . Managing both tacit and explicit knowledge is the challenge of knowledge management (KM). Tacit knowledge is the knowledge that cannot be expressed in words whereas explicit knowledge refers to knowledge that can be expressed in words and numbers [29, 30] . KM is defined as an activity of helping an organization to create, capture, codify, store, share and apply knowledge effectively. KM in information system perspective refers to the effective tool to enable the knowledge management processes. In this context, a knowledge management system (KMS) is the key enabler of KM and is applied in nature.",

This could lead to difficulties in making accurate decisions, under time-pressured and intense situations, while responding to a particular disaster situation. In this context, we suggest that a KMS can be used for capture and then re-use of specific crisis response knowledge which can support decision making when a crisis actually occurs. The practice of selectively applying knowledge from previous experiences during turbulent moments of decision making, to current and future decision making activities with the express purpose of improving the organization's effectiveness, would be possible via a KMS. In addition, we further add that given the dynamic nature of disaster situations, coupled with different inputs and requirements from various stakeholder groups, a disaster manager and center therein, is subject to information overload, which can prevent timely and accurate decision making. experiences of decision-making to current and future decision making activities with the express purpose of improving the organization's effectiveness. KM is an action discipline; knowledge needs to be used and applied for KM to have an impact. [46] further stress that knowledge about past situations are relevant to generate current procedures and forecast future responses. During an emergency situation, lessons learned and understanding of what works best in given situations (both examples of knowledge) [46] enables emergency managers to be prepared with workable plans to ensure smooth decision making process.",

However, the KMS definition covers all of these roles and the combination of the different roles to support knowledge process [34, 53] . Therefore, as the first step, we decided to examine the number of papers for the selected keywords. The keywords include key concepts that are general (KM) toward more specific keywords (KMS for disaster/emergency).",

In this regard, we call for a closer alignment between EMIS and KMS, given that at times, the objectives of both EMIS-and KMS-driven systems are similar in the area of supporting disaster/emergency management. In terms of use, the papers focused on emergency response and rescue (Table 5 ). Another popular use is for decision support. Very few papers describe EMIS-KMS use for pre-disaster stages, such as training, preparedness, mitigation, and prevention.

Firstly a well-designed KMS can bring a group of experts together-thus offering a powerful platform for sharing prior experience in managing disasters. This knowledge base can in turn be used to aid timely response disaster situations. Although the idea of using a KMS to aid disaster management has attracted some interest in the last decade, the ideas inherent in applying expert knowledge to aid disaster planning and response are arguably not new. [108] introduced the notion of using Delphi, more than three decades ago and suggested the importance of expert viewpoints being brought together to address disaster management issues. The major difference though between this seminal work and contemporary literature/projects on KMS is that while the former systems were predominantly led by structuredmilitary style of disaster management driven by manual procedures, the latter systems can be designed to offer more robust and flexible creation, storage, sharing and ultimately dissemination of a disaster related knowledge base. Secondly, even within the realm of a KMS to support disaster management efforts, literature suggests that these systems can benefit from the utilization of social networking ideas-driven by web 2.0 (and beyond) architectures, to offer a more dynamic and real time use of KMS in an actual disaster situation [12, 54, 77, 109, 110] . Fig. 7 further explains some of our findings based on our assessment of the literature, which can also be used to suggest several core differences between an informational 'vis a vis' knowledge view of systems designed to support disaster management.",

[109] in this regard assert that any knowledge structure should support the nature of an ever evolving context, allow flexible alterations and thus classification of meaning in relation to disasters. The authors further add that modern technologies such as wikis, blogs, and other forms of Web 2.0 and beyond architectures support these requirements [109] . \u2022 Support both informational and knowledge requirements of different roles played by emergency planners and responders (i.e. allow communities to share both tacit and explicit knowledge domains pertaining to disasters that are highly contextual) [12, 111] . \u2022 Handle timely coordination efforts through both synchronous and asynchronous feedback, during the different phases of a disaster situation. In this regard, we propose that an Emergency Management Information System supports mainly structural/organizational requirements in managing disasters. However a KMS is driven by the need to support timely interactions between humans (communities of practice), and support continuously conversations (synchronous/asynchronous) between people involved in disaster management [109] .",

In this study, we applied the five-stage methodology of [52] in writing papers based on the comprehensive review of literature in a given area. This methodology was used to understand the extent and nature of applied KMS research in aid of emergency/disaster management. From an extensive search of 8408 papers in the KM domain, our search list was narrowed to 51 papers (0.6%) that have examined applied-KMS for disaster/emergency. Our in-depth review of the 51 papers suggests that a scope for more significant research on the four major areas is present. First, an urgent need exists for researchers to streamline the use of terminologies pertaining to emergency/ disaster management. Second, we feel that more work can be done to ascertain if KMS (for emergency management) and EMIS share similar goals or otherwise. The extent of the similarities/differences between KMS-EMIS in this context could also be further explored. Third, only three papers clearly use an action research approach and relate KMS to disaster/emergency management, despite the call for IS researchers to conduct more applied work based on action research methodology [107] . Finally, more empirical work is required to better understand the determinants of KMS success factors in the context of emergency/disaster management.",
