            "text": "Tropical Asia is the homeland for slightly more than 169.4 million of the total world population of 178.2 million domestic buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) estimated in 2006. Domestic buffaloes in Asia are of two types: the swamp type for draught in the eastern half of Asia and the river type for milk in the western half of Asia. The river-type buffaloes, the once-neglected farm species, currently produce about 73.2 million tonnes of milk annually from some of the world's best buffalo breeds in India and Pakistan. They breed throughout the year, conceive at 250-275 kg body weight, calve for the first time at 3-5 years of age following a gestation period of 305-320 days, and produce two calves every 3 years. Lactating animals are fed mainly on straw, crop residues, and mineral supplements such as urea-molasses-mineral block (UMMB). In most rural areas, animals are hand-milked twice daily and the calf is used to stimulate milk letdown. The lactation period is 200-300 days with first lactation milk yields of 1500-800 kg. Breeding females are retained in the herd until about the ninth lactation (16 years of age) with reasonable economic returns. River buffaloes are vulnerable to most infectious and metabolic diseases affecting cattle. In India and Pakistan, milk is marketed through a network of milk cooperatives, which guarantee a stable price throughout the year for the farmer. Buffalo milk contains twice as much butterfat as cow milk. Besides ghee, several other products are manufactured from buffalo milk, such as butter, cheese, full cream milk powder, skim milk powder, and infant milk powder. Thus, the domestic buffalo is emerging as an alternative source for the manufacture of dairy products worldwide. Buffalo Species, Types, Population",

On the contrary, the Asian buffalo (B. bubalis) was domesticated around the same time in history as cattle for draft power, milk, and meat ( Figure 1 ). The domestic buffalo is also known as the 'water buffalo' because of its fondness to cool itself in water ( Figure 2 ). The two types of domesticated water buffaloes found in Asia, that is, the river and the swamp type, differ in their wallowing habits, chromosome numbers, and physical features ( Table 1) . The river buffalo makes up nearly 75% of the buffalo population in Asia. The dairy breeds of river buffaloes are the Murrah, Nili-Ravi, and Surti in India and the Nili-Ravi and Kundi in Pakistan. ",

Also the pregnancy rates have been less than 10% in Bulgaria and India, as compared with 50-70% in dairy cattle. Previous studies have shown that the superovulatory response to gonadotropins is comparable to that of cattle. However, low embryo recovery rates were not necessarily due to poor superovulatory responses, but instead due to failure of oocytes to enter the oviduct and/or impairment of embryo transport in the reproductive tract. In vitro fertilization (IVF) of buffalo oocytes is an alternative to superovulation. Several laboratories have produced buffalo embryos by IVF. In 1997, the first IVF buffalo calf was born in India. Since oocytes can be collected at slaughter from highproducing buffaloes at the end of their lactation (see section Feeding the Lactating Buffalo), IVF has potential applications in Pakistan and India.",

In fact, swamp buffalo milk has higher fat (9-15%), protein (7.1%), lactose (4.9%), and ash (0.89%) contents. In general, calcium, iron, and phosphorus contents are higher in buffalo milk than in cow milk. The lower cholesterol content in buffalo milk should make it more popular than cow milk in the health-conscious public. Unlike the cow, the buffalo converts the yellow pigment beta-carotene into vitamin A, which is colorless, and is passed on to milk. Therefore, buffalo milk is distinctively whiter than cow milk; not only cow milk is pale creamish-yellow but also the milk fat is golden yellow.",

Thus, the domestic buffalo is more sensitive than cattle to direct solar radiation and high ambient temperatures during the summer months. Thermal stress may lead to higher calf mortality, lower milk yields, slow growth, and depressed signs of estrus. Thermal stress can be reduced by providing cooling facilities such as shade and wallows and sprinkling water on to the skin during the hotter part of the day, and feeding roughage during the night.",
