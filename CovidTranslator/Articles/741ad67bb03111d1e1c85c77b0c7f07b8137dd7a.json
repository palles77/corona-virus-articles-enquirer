            "text": "An analytical method for the quantitative measurement of ML-7, a product with possible anti-immune escape activity for feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), in feline plasma was developed and validated. The sample preparation consists of a solid-phase extraction step on an MCX cartridge. ML-7 and ML-9, used as the internal standard for the analysis, were separated on an ACQUITY UPLC TM BEH C 18 reversedphase column (1.7 m, 50 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm I.D.), using isocratic elution with acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water as the mobile phase. Both compounds were subsequently quantified in MRM mode on a Micromass \u00ae Quattro Premier TM XE triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The use of a Thermo Scientific \u00ae Exactive TM orbitrap mass spectrometer made it possible to confirm the proposed fragmentation pattern of both ML-7 and ML-9. A validation study according to EC requirements was carried out, in which the method showed good performance. Linear behaviour was observed in the 1-2500 ng ml \u22121 range, which is relevant for real sample analysis. Accuracy and precision were within the criteria requested by the EC requirements throughout this concentration range. Extraction recovery of ML-7 was 72%. Matrix effect for ML-7 was not higher than 8%. The method was successfully used for the monitoring of ML-7 in feline plasma after intravenous, subcutaneous or oral administration of an ML-7 formulation, for the determination of pharmacokinetic parameters, with a limit of quantification of 1 ng ml \u22121 and a limit of detection of 0.4 ng ml \u22121 . The proposed method also shows good characteristics for the analysis of ML-7 in plasma of other animal species and human plasma.",

            "text": "Infection of cats with feline coronavirus (FCoV) can have two different outcomes. Cats infected with avirulent FCoV-strains usually develop mild enteritis, while virulent FCoV-strains can cause progressive and usually fatal vasculitis known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [1] . FIP is one of the most common infectious causes of death in young cats because neither effective treatment nor vaccine is available. It is an enigmatic disease and its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Recent work of our research group gave new insights into the interaction of infected monocytes (the in vivo target cell of the virus) with the immune system. We demonstrated that the virus has developed multiple mechanisms to evade the host's humoral immune system. Once the virus is replicating in a monocyte, it will ensure that it is protected from the omnipresent antibodies by inhibition of viral protein expression in the plasma membrane. This is achieved by intracellular retention of viral proteins or antibody-induced internalization of proteins that reached the plasma membrane [2, 3] . Both mechanisms offer protection from recognition by antibodies and thus from antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis (ADCML) and cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [4, 5] . ADCML can occur either through the formation of membrane attack complexes or through effector cells which carry a complement receptor (neutrophils, monocytes or macrophages). ADCC is executed by neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages or natural killer cells.",

            "text": "These immune-evasion mechanisms could explain why FIPV infected cells are not eliminated despite high antibody titres found in most infected cats. The internalization pathway was fully characterized and was found to be dependent on (among others) myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) [6] . ML-7, in full 1-(5-iodonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine hydrochloride, a potent and selective MLCK inhibitor was found to be a good candidate for in vivo blocking of the immune-evasive internalization and might thus form the basis of a new and innovative anti-immune evasion therapy. With ML-7, the immune-evasion mechanisms of FIPV can be blocked and by doing so, the cat will be enabled to overcome the infection. The anti-immune evasion therapy is a completely new approach for the control of chronic viral diseases. It offers the following potential advantages, compared to other existing antiviral therapies: (1) continuous administration of the chemical is not required; (2) there are no associated problems related to resistance; (3) it can lead to elimination of the virus; (4) it can be applied for different viruses using this immuno-evasion process. ML-7 is a chemical that has been developed in 1987 at the Mie University in Japan to study the function of MLCK. It is the most active of a family of naphthalene derivatives, as a selective MLCK inhibitor [7] . Its structure is shown in Fig. 1 , as well as that of ML-9, a related MLCK inhibitor. Up till now, no patents were filed on the compound, which is currently commercially available at most large chemical companies such as Sigma-Aldrich, Calbiochem, Alexxis and VWR.",

These parameters can be evaluated on plasma concentration versus time profiles of the drug after administration to a sufficient number of animals. For this purpose, a reliable and sensitive analysis method of the drug in plasma must be available. The development, and subsequent validation, of such a method for the determination of ML-7 in feline plasma is presented and discussed in this paper. To our knowledge, the determination of ML-7 -or a related component -in animal plasma, has not been published yet. Also the determination of ML-7 in other body fluids and/or tissues of human or animal origin has not been described yet, demonstrating the novelty of our approach. For the clean-up of the plasma samples, two major strategies were followed and evaluated. The first one is based on a liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate, while the second one involves a solidphase extraction (SPE) step on an Oasis \u00ae MCX (mixed-mode cation exchange sorbent) cartridge. Extracts were then injected onto an UPLC (ultra performance liquid chromatography) instrument and components were measured by ESI-MS/MS (electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry). Since the extraction with ethyl acetate was shown to be very prone to a variable matrix effect, the method with clean-up on an MCX cartridge was retained for further validation experiments. It showed thereby good performance characteristics. It was sensitive enough with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1 ng ml \u22121 and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.4 ng ml \u22121 that could be established. Finally, it was shown to be of practical use for the monitoring of plasma concentration time profiles of ML-7 after administration (intravenous, subcutaneous, oral) of a drug formulation to cats, used for pharmacokinetic analysis. The method also showed potential for the quantitative analysis of ML-7 in plasma of other animal species, and in human plasma.",

Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry ML-7, and a related compound ML-9, used as internal standard, could be easily separated on an ACQUITY UPLC TM BEH C 18 reversedphase column (1.7 m, 50 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm I.D.), using 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile as the mobile phase, which is probably the most commonly used solvent system for LC-MS analysis. The only difference in the chemical structure of the components, an I-atom for ML-7 and a Cl-atom for ML-9 in the naphthalene part (see Fig. 1) , gives however such a difference in polarity and in molecular mass (91.45 Da), making their isocratic separation not really a challenge. ML-9 is then the earlier eluting component with a retention time of 2.19 min, under the chromatographic conditions as described in Section 2.3, while ML-7 elutes about 1 min later at 3.28 min (see Fig. 2 for a chromatogram of a standard solution) . Fig. 1 shows besides the chemical structures of both ML-7 and ML-9, also the mass spectra obtained after direct infusion of a standard solution of 5 g ml \u22121 of ML-7 and ML-9 in the ESI source, in combination with the LC mobile phase using a T-union. The best Fig. 2 . MS/MS mass chromatograms of a standard solution of ML-7 and ML-9 (equivalent of 10 ng ml \u22121 sample), a blank plasma spiked with ML-7 and ML-9 (equivalent of 10 ng ml \u22121 sample) after extraction, a blank plasma spiked at 10 ng ml \u22121 of ML-7, a blank plasma sample spiked at 1 ng ml \u22121 of ML-7 (=LOQ), a blank plasma sample, and an incurred plasma sample (ML-7 concentration measured = 299.1 ng ml \u22121 , of a cat treated intravenously with 4 mg/kg BW, 2 h after administration). All chromatograms of spiked samples shown concern blank 1. ML-9 concentration in all plasma samples is 100 ng ml \u22121 . For each chromatogram, the upper trace represents ML-9, the lower trace is signal was obtained in the positive ion mode, probably because the components incorporate e.g. 2 N-atoms that can be easily protonated. In MS, a major ion at m/z 417.07 and 325.29 was observed for ML-7 and ML-9 respectively, corresponding to the protonated molecules [M+H] + of both components (molecular mass of respectively 416.28 and 324.83 as base). For ML-9, clearly also an ion lower in intensity at m/z 327.30 was observed due to the 37 Clisotope. The CID product ion spectra of both components show a predominant ion at m/z 98.97, which was therefore used in the MRM transition for quantification. According to the Mass Frontier 6.0 software (HighChem, Ltd., Bratislava, Slovakia) this corresponds to the 1,4-diazepine moiety of the components, after protonation and charge site rearrangement (rHc (\u2425)). This software has a module \"Fragments and Mechanisms\" which is an expert system providing information about basic fragmentation and rearrangement processes based on literature, starting from a user-supplied chemical structure. A major product ion with higher m/z was also observed, at m/z 253.10 and 160.93 for ML-7 and ML-9 respectively, according to Mass Frontier corresponding to the iodonaphthalene and chloronaphthalene moieties of the components, after protonation and inductive cleavage (i). Also several common fragments at lower m/z were present in the product ion spectra: m/z 43.94, 55.88, 57.03, 58.10, 68.01, 68.96, 69.98, 82.03 and 85.02. These correspond all -according to Mass Frontier -to smaller fragments of the 1,4-diazepine moiety of the components, as the result of more complex fragmentation mechanisms.",

A solid-phase extraction on an MCX cartridge was found to be necessary as sample clean-up step, to avoid matrix effect on the detection of ML-7 on the MS instrument. However, the method remains rather simple and not very time consuming, allowing the analysis of a sufficient number of samples in a reasonable time period. Validation of the method showed its good performance characteristics, possibly also for plasma of other animal species and human plasma. Also the practical use of the method was shown to determine plasma concentration versus time profiles of ML-7 after its administration to cats, to determine the pharmacokinetics needed to design an adequate dosage regimen.",
