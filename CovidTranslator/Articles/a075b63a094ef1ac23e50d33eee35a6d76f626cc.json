However, a number of problems confront the cytopathologist on a daily basis because of limitations of conventional cytologic features. Adjunct techniques can be used to give additional information, which allows one to reach a definitive diagnosis. These techniques must be used in parallel with conventional cytologic features; they include immunodiagnostics for cellular origin, electron microscopy (EM) for presence of subcellular structures, special histochemical stains for demonstration of chemical constituents, flow cytometry and image analysis for quantitative evaluation of cellular markers, and molecular diagnostics for clonality or chromosomal abnormalities. In this chapter we discuss adjunct diagnostic techniques and focus on their applications in both cytopathology and histopathology.",

            "text": "The detection of antigens by immunologic and chemical reactions in tissue sections (immunohistochemistry, IHC), or cytologic preparations (immunocytochemistry, ICC) has become one of the most commonly used ancillary morphologic techniques in diagnostic pathology (Barr and Wu, 2006) . The advantages of IHC and ICC are as follows: 1) They do not require the use of expensive equipment. 2) Both prospective and retrospective studies can be done on a variety of samples. 3) Antigen detection can be correlated with morphologic changes (IHC) and its cellular location (ICC). 4) Stained slides can be stored for many months. 5) Routine processing of samples is usually acceptable for these techniques. Both IHC and ICC are practical in the characterization of poorly differentiated neoplasms, differentiation of primary from metastatic tumors, and determination of sites of origin of metastatic lesions and prognostic assessments (DeLellis and Hoda, 2006) . The general consensus is that IHC/ICC methods, if properly applied and interpreted, increase diagnostic accuracy in pathology. Technical aspects of IHC and ICC, interpretation of results, and pitfalls will be reviewed. An algorithmic approach to the diagnosis of tumors, the diagnosis of metastatic disease, and the use of antibodies as prognostic markers will be presented. This review will not include detailed IHC or ICC procedures. For this purpose, the reader is referred to other published material (Polak and Van Noorden, 2003; Ramos-Vara and Miller, 2014) . Refer to the Appendix for further information regarding leukocyte ICC protocols.",

Polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies can be used. In general, polyclonal antibodies are usually raised in rabbits and have higher affinity but lower specificity than monoclonal antibodies. Cross-reactivity (defined as recognition of unrelated antigens) is more common with polyclonal antibodies. Key in the use of polyclonal antibodies in diagnostic IHC/ ICC is their degree of purification (examples of commercially available antibodies include whole serum antibodies, antibodies purified by precipitation of immunoglobulins, and immunoglobulins purified by affinity chromatography). Monoclonal antibodies, produced in mice using the hybridoma technology, recognize a single epitope (a four-to eight-amino acid chain in a protein) and therefore are highly specific and have constant characteristics among different batches of antibody. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies are increasingly being used in human diagnostic IHC, but despite their reported advantages over mouse monoclonal antibodies (e.g., higher affinity, no need for antigen retrieval [AR] , use on mouse tissues), some of them neither react on animal tissues nor perform better than mouse monoclonal antibodies (Reid et al., 2007; Vilches-Moure and Ramos-Vara, 2005) . Selection of a particular antibody will be determined by published information or the experience of other laboratories. There are no guarantees that an antibody that recognizes an antigen in one species will do so in another species; only testing will determine if this is the case. Needless to say, the large number of species from which samples can be obtained is one of the biggest challenges that a veterinary pathologist must face in immunodiagnostics.",

            "text": "The universal fixative for histopathology and diagnostic IHC is buffered formalin. Attempts to replace formalin fixative in diagnostic IHC have failed, although for specific situations the use of nonformaldehyde fixatives, particularly glyoxal-based, has been reported (Yaziji and Barry, 2006) . Fixation is necessary to preserve cellular components, to prevent autolysis and displacement of cell constituents, to stabilize cellular materials (antigens), and to facilitate conventional staining and immunostaining (Ramos-Vara, 2005) . The use of formalin is not without problems. First, the quality of formalin solutions 17 Advanced Diagnostic Techniques Jos\u00e9 A. Ramos-Vara, Paul R. Avery, Anne C. Avery varies widely in regard to concentration of formaldehyde, pH, and presence of preservatives. Second, formalin fixation, by producing methylene bridges between amino groups and other functional groups, alters the tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins and forms cross-links between soluble tissues and proteins (Ramos-Vara and Miller, 2014) . These chemical reactions may modify the targeted epitope. Amino acids that are especially sensitive to formalin fixation include lysine, glycine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine, and serine. Despite the fact that formalin fixation may impair immunohistochemical detection, good fixation is paramount to detect antigens with IHC. It is currently accepted that underfixation is as bad as or worse than overfixation and is a fairly common problem due to reduced turnaround times in diagnostic laboratories (Ramos-Vara and Miller, 2014) . With the advent of heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER), overfixation or variable fixation time among samples is less critical in the detection of antigens targeted in diagnostic IHC (Webster et al., 2009 (Webster et al., , 2010 . Autolysis is a common problem in diagnostic pathology. Studies addressing the effects of autolysis in IHC have shown that most antigens are still detectable despite decomposition; however, caution in the interpretation of autolyzed material is necessary due to the loss of detection of some antigens (Maleszewski et al., 2007) . Necrotic tissue tends to produce more background than normal tissue; however, IHC of necrotic tissue can provide valuable information when no other tissue is available, particularly for cytokeratins and CD45. Decalcification of formalin-fixed tissues generally does not reduce the immunoreactivity of most antigens; loss of reactivity may occur when using strong acids for decalcification, but it does not affect all antigens. For a detailed review of fixation in IHC, refer to Ramos-Vara and Miller (2014) .",

Antigens have been successfully detected in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues stored for several decades (Litlekalsoy et al., 2007) . Autolyzed samples or those with biopsy artifacts should be avoided. For IHC and ICC, samples are mounted onto silanized slides, poly-L-lysine-coated slides, or charged slides to allow a strong bond between the slide and the tissue section. Pooling of reagents under the tissue section or tissue loss can occur when using noncharged slides or slides without special coatings. Complete deparaffination is critical to achieve optimal immunostaining. Deparaffination is somewhat cumbersome, and there are commercial products to perform deparaffination and AR simultaneously, although results may not be completely satisfactory (Ramos-Vara and Miller, 2014) . A simple approach to deparaffination and AR with heat has recently been published (Boenisch, 2007) .",

            "text": "Fixation and tissue processing modify the three-dimensional structure of proteins (antigens), which can render them undetectable by specific antibodies. This fact is better understood if we remember that, in general, an immunologic reaction between antigen and antibody depends on the conformation of the former (Hayat, 2002) . One challenge of IHC is to develop AR methods that reverse the changes produced by fixation. AR is particularly necessary when tissues are fixed in crosslinking fixatives. Approximately 85% of antigens fixed in formalin require some type of AR to optimize the immunoreaction (Ramos-Vara and Beissenherz, 2000). The need for AR and choice of AR method depends not only on the antigen examined but also on the antibody used (Varma et al., 1999) . Polyclonal antibodies are more likely to detect antigens than monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in the absence of AR . Although AR allows detection of multiple antigens, background staining or antigen detection in unusual locations due to harsh AR methods is not uncommon, and can preclude diagnostic interpretation. In addition to conformational changes in the structure of proteins, fixation produces major changes in the electrostatic charge of proteins (antigens), which is critical for the initial attraction between antigens and antibodies. Therefore, recovery of the electrostatic charges lost during formalin fixation has been proposed as another mechanism of AR for many (but not all) proteins. In other words, it appears that more than one mechanism may be involved in the lack of recognition of antigens by antibodies after fixation in cross-linking fixatives. The two more common AR procedures include proteolytic enzymes (e.g., pronase, trypsin, proteinase K) and immersion of slides in buffer at high temperature. Each antibody may react differently to AR; therefore, it is necessary to test several methods when optimizing the IHC procedure. In general, HIER procedures appear to produce optimal results in a wide variety of antibodies. With the variety of AR methods available, standardization of IHC methods among laboratories and comparison of results is very challenging at best (Ramos-Vara and Miller, 2014) .",

Endogenous alkaline phosphatase (for alkaline phosphatase detection methods) is blocked in procedures using this enzyme. Mammalian tissues have two alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes: The nonintestinal form is easily blocked with levamisole, and the intestinal isoform unfortunately requires acetic acid, a chemical that can damage some antigens, to be blocked. Numerous tissues have endogenous avidin-biotin activity that must be blocked before adding biotinylated reagents in avidin-biotin detection systems.

The two main enzymes used in IHC are peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. Peroxidase is probably the most commonly used, but in some occasions, particularly with heavily pigmented samples or samples rich in endogenous peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase is an excellent alternative. Current IHC methods can be divided into avidin-biotin or non-avidinbiotin systems. After incubation with the primary antibody, a secondary antibody specific for the primary antibody (secondary reagent) is added. For avidin-biotin systems, the secondary reagent is biotinylated. For avidin-biotin methods, a tertiary reagent labeled with avidin molecules and an enzyme (peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) is needed (Ramos-Vara and Miller, 2014) . The most common non-avidin-biotin method is based on polymer technology. The polymers contain many molecules of secondary antibodies and enzyme. Polymer methods are usually two-step methods; however, supersensitive polymer methods consist of three steps, which are similar to avidin-biotin methods.",

Visualization of the Immunologic Reaction. The addition of a substrate for the enzyme used plus a chromogen will produce a colored reaction if there is binding of antibodies to tissue antigens. For immunoperoxidase methods, the most common chromogen is 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride hydrate (DAB), which produces a brown deposit. Another common chromogen is 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole (AEC). For alkaline phosphatase, Fast Blue and Fast Red are common chromogens. The use of a chromogen needs to be coordinated with the counterstaining and coverslipping methods.",

Optimization (standardization) of a new antibody/test is the process of serially testing and modifying components of the procedure (e.g., fixation, AR, antibody dilution, detection system, incubation time, etc.) with the aim of producing a consistent, high-quality assay. The reader is advised to standardize every antibody used in his/her laboratory despite the existence of published protocols, to ensure optimal results. Standardization includes adequate tissue fixation. Tissues not thicker than 4 mm should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 8 hours. Every new antibody is tested following a standard protocol that includes three pretreatments-no AR, AR with a proteolytic enzyme (e.g., proteinase K), and HIER (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)-and four two-fold dilutions of the primary antibody . With this standard protocol, the total number of slides initially processed for each antibody is 15, including a negative reagent control for each pretreatment. The positive control section used in standardization (and later in a diagnostic setting) is one in which the antigen in question has been detected with a different method (e.g., virus isolation) and its cellular location is known. A negative control section (containing cells known by independent methods to lack the antigen in question) also should be included. Usually, the same tissue block used for the positive control can be used for the negative control.",

If staining is nonspecific or suboptimal, other AR methods and dilutions should be tested. Keep in mind that some antibodies raised against human antigens may not be reactive in animal tissues.

Validation of a test examines technical aspects such as the effects of prolonged fixation but focuses more on the ability of the antibody to be used as a marker of a specific cell, tumor, or infectious agent. Antibodies used as tumor markers need to be tested against tumors that may be difficult to distinguish from the one in question (tumors with similar phenotype, e.g., round cell tumors) with routine stains and tumors present in the same location/organ . Validation should also include evaluation of staining differences among different tumors, staining differences within tumors-particularly when different phenotypes are present (e.g., spindle and epithelioid melanomas staining differences with Melan-A)-and differences between primary and metastatic tumors. Validation is critical given the relative immunologic promiscuity (recognition of more than one cell type or tumor) of most antibodies. Finally, and due to the proven variation of antibody reactivity among different species, standardization and validation of an immunochemical procedure must be done in each species examined. Due to the large resources needed to perform in-house validation studies in veterinary medicine, it is acceptable to use the information provided by other researchers or reported in the literature to validate a test.",

            "text": "Processing of Cytologic Samples ICC can be performed on most types of cytologic samples, including cytospins, cell smears, cell blocks, cell cultures, and liquid-based monolayer preparations (Bratthauer, 2010; Chivukula and Dabbs, 2010; Dupr\u00e9 and Courtadi-Saidi, 2012; Fetsch and Abati, 2004; Skoog and Tani, 2011; Stone and Gan, 2014; Zhang et al., 1998) . Cytospins and cell smears are used when the sample volume is small. The advantage of cytospins is better preservation of cytomorphology. Cell smears give reproducible results with nuclear markers but may be less suitable for cytoplasmic and membrane markers due to the high background produced by cell damage during slide preparation (Skoog and Tani, 2011) . Cytospin preparations can be less susceptible to cell damage than smears. The use of pretreated slides to promote cell adhesion reduces loss of cells over the course of the ICC procedure (Dupr\u00e9 and Courtade-Saidi, 2012) . Cell blocks are one of the best choices for ICC, particularly when cells are numerous (Miller, 2011; Ramos-Vara, 2013) . Cell blocks are processed similarly to surgical pathology specimens, so IHC methods can be used without adaptive modifications (Dupr\u00e9 and Courtade-Saidi, 2012) . See the Appendix for a brief description of the overall protocol. In addition, multiple sections can be produced from a single block, so multiple markers can be evaluated in the same cell population (Dupr\u00e9 and Courtade-Saidi, 2012; Varsegi and Shidham, 2009 ). However, cell blocks can alter cytologic detail and cause variation in cellularity depending on the lesion evaluated by fine-needle aspirate (FNA), the cellularity of FNA needle rinses, the sampling effectiveness during dedicated FNA passes for the cell block, and postprocedural handling of the needle rinse specimen (Brown, 2001; Roh et al., 2012) . Importantly, because cell blocks are fixed in formaldehyde-containing solutions, sections from cell blocks may need to undergo AR procedures (Brown, 2001; Shi et al., 2011) . Cell blocks are preferred for nuclear antigens (e.g., Ki-67, p53, proliferating nuclear cell antigen [PCNA]), whereas airdried cytospins are preferred for the detection of surface antigens (e.g., leukocytic antigens). Liquid-based cytology using ThinPrep preparations enhances retrieval of cells from small samples with preservation of cellular detail and, theoretically, a reduction of background due to less blood, mucin, and proteinaceous material in the sample (Dupr\u00e9 and Courtade-Saidi, 2012). Micro-metastasis from carcinomas to the bone marrow in dogs and cats has been demonstrated recently using a cell block method of aspirate material stained with antibodies to CKAE1/AE3 and CK7 (Taylor et al., 2013) . ThinPreps are less suitable than cell blocks for detection of nuclear antigens (Gong et al., 2003) . A more detailed discussion of the pros and cons of different cytologic preparation methods can be found in Fowler and Lachar (2008) . Under certain circumstances, ICC may be performed on previously stained Romanowsky or Papanicolaou slides when that is the only available specimen; it produces similar results to that of unstained slides. The ICC staining can be done with or without previous destaining (with acid alcohol) of the routine stain (Abendroth and Dabbs, 1995; Barr and Wu, 2006; Miller and Kubier, 2002) . However, there are some technical drawbacks to using previously stained slides: loss of cells from the slide, cell disruption (affecting mostly ICC of membranous and cytoplasmic markers), and signal reduction for some markers (e.g., S100) due to repeated passage of the sample through graded alcohols. In cases in which only a slide is available and the area containing cells is large, multiple markers can be tested simultaneously. Alternatively, the sample can be divided following tissue-transfer techniques (Stone and Gan, 2014; Dupr\u00e9 and Courtade-Saidi, 2012) . Cell transfer techniques allow the evaluation of multiple markers when few slides are available for ICC (Stone and Gan, 2014) . If cell transfer from previously stained cytologic smears is anticipated, nonadhesive treated slides should be used (Miller, 2011) .",

Contrary to the situation in histopathology and IHC in which 10% formalin is the universal fixative, there is no standard fixative for cytologic specimens. In general, the type of fixation will be determined by the cytologic procedure and the antigens to be tested (Skoog and Tani, 2011) . Cytology slides are either wetfixed or air-dried and fixed immediately before performing ICC (Dabbs, 2002; Valli et al., 2009) . When wet-fixed preparations were compared with air-dried samples, there were no significant changes in terms of cytologic preservation or ICC staining. However, air-dried preparations may lose fewer cells than wetfixed samples; some have reported inconsistent ICC results with air-dried samples (Dupr\u00e9 and Courtade-Saidi, 2012) .",

However, other authors have reported that air-drying of smears prior to fixation makes estrogen or progesterone receptor detection more difficult (Miller, 2011) . For membrane and cytoplasmic antigens, the type of fixation is not as critical because for nuclear antigens, a variety of fixatives, including formalin followed by ethanol, a 1:1 mixture of methanol-absolute ethanol, or fixation in \u221220\u00b0C acetone produce good results (Skoog and Tani, 2011) . Extra caution is needed when using acetone as fixative for ICC to detect small peptides. Acetone solubilizes cell membranes, leading to diffusion of small peptides out of cells and false-negative results (Van der Loos, 2007) . Antigens such as S100 protein, Hep Par 1, and gross cystic fluid protein-15 are leached by alcohol fixatives, producing false-negative results (Chivukula and Dabbs, 2010) . One laboratory proposes these guidelines: 1) Samples should be fixed immediately prior to the ICC procedure; 2) for lymphoid and melanoma markers, samples should be fixed for 5 to 10 minutes at room temperature in acetone; for epithelial markers, 5 minutes at room temperature in 95% ethanol or 1:1 mixture of methanol and 100% ethanol; for nuclear antigens, 3.7% buffered formalin for 15 minutes (Fetsch and Abati, 2004) . Some authors use formal saline as a \"universal\" fixative (Leong et al., 1999) . Others advocate air-drying slides if a lymphoma is suspected and immediately fixing smears in 95% ethanol (without airdrying) in all other cases (Miller, 2011) . A recent comparison of FFPE cell blocks with alcohol-fixed centrifuged preparations (AFCPs) did not find significant differences (Ikeda et al., 2011) . S100 protein, gross cystic disease fluid protein-15, and hormone receptors are not well demonstrated in ethanol-fixed samples due to cytoplasmic antigen leakage (Dabbs, 2002) .",

Unfortunately, the wide range of fixation procedures makes standardization of AR procedures among laboratories very difficult; each laboratory must optimize the procedure for each antigen (Kirbis et al., 2011; Shtilbans et al., 2005) . AFCPs without AR performed similarly to cell blocks with AR in many cases; however, for some tests, particularly those detecting nuclear antigens, AR improved the reactivity of AFCPs (Ikeda et al., 2011) . HIER using citrate buffer pH 6.0 is necessary for most nuclear antigens on ethanol-fixed cytologic smears; for some cytoplasmic membrane and cytoplasmic antigens, it enhances the immunoreaction (Denda et al., 2012) . Few cytoplasmic membrane antigens require HIER with higher pH buffers (Denda et al., 2012) . Some laboratories perform HIER irrespective of the fixation type (Zhang et al., 2012) . Enzymatic AR is much less commonly used than HIER in ICC (Zhang et al., 2012) . The mechanism of action of HIER might depend on the fixative. When the amount of cytologic specimen is limited, the same slide can be tested for a second marker if the first test is negative (Dabbs and Wang, 1998) . When performing HIER or protease AR on smears, use adhesive slides; otherwise, cytologic material is likely to detach from the slides (Miller, 2011) .",

There are several steps previous to the incubation of the primary antibody (e.g., endogenous peroxidase block, nonspecific binding block, avidin-biotin block, AR). After the primary antibody incubation, a secondary, and sometimes a tertiary, reagent is necessary to demonstrate the immune reaction. The peroxidase block is necessary when using immunoperoxidase techniques; the usual method is with 3% H 2 O 2 in deionized water. In blood-rich smears, the use of alkaline phosphatase procedures rather than immunoperoxidase will avoid the background produced by endogenous peroxidase without the need for strong (with sometimes deleterious effects on antigenicity) quenching reagents (Dupr\u00e9 and Courtade-Saidi, 2012) . AR may be necessary on some occasions. Unfortunately, there is no rule to determine a priori whether AR is needed or which method is optimal. The approach to standardize ICC is similar to that for IHC. A comprehensive list of antibodies used in ICC at the National Cancer Institute, including antibody sources, dilution of the primary antibody, and fixation and AR methods, is available (Fetsch and Abati, 2004) .",

Specific knowledge of the right staining pattern of a given marker is extremely important to determine whether the staining is significant or not. As stressed in a later section on immunohistochemical diagnosis of metastatic tumors, there are very few, if any, antibodies that are truly specific for a single cell type. The interpretation of an IHC/ICC reaction is based on the expected \"antibody personality profile\" (see below) and the infidelity of tumor-specific markers (e.g., reactivity in T-cells with B-cell markers) (Yaziji and Barry, 2006) . Simultaneous presence of an antigen in more than one cellular compartment is possible in neoplastic cells but usually results from diffusion of proteins due to cellular damage during processing. Detection of an antigen in an unusual location should be interpreted with caution and indicated in the immunohistochemical report. Generally speaking, antibodies used in IHC can be used in ICC, but not all antibodies used in ICC can be used in IHC. In addition, some antibodies that are nonreactive in surgical biopsy specimens may be suitable for cytologic preparations.",

This is a controversial issue so only guidelines will be given. Some markers are expected to be present in most cells in a tumor (e.g., cytokeratins in a carcinoma), whereas the detection of other markers (e.g., uroplakin III in transitional cell carcinoma) in only a small group of cells is considered a positive result. Perhaps, as recommended in human pathology (Goldstein et al., 2007) , a statement in the report indicating the intensity of the staining and the percentage of positive tumor cells would be more informative than merely a positive or negative result (H\u00f6inghaus et al., 2008) . The lack of expression of a particular antigen may be as significant as its presence in prognostication (e.g., absence of expression of progesterone receptor is linked to poor outcome in human breast cancer; lack of bcl-6 expression combined with MUM1 expression in cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma is linked to short survival) (Bardou et al., 2003; Sundram et al., 2005) . In human pathology, IHC antibodies are classified as class I devices by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), meaning that antibodies are considered special stains as adjuncts to conventional histopathologic diagnostic examination (Rhodes, 2005) . In other words, with some exceptions, IHC is not a standalone technique and results must be interpreted by the pathologist in the context of the disease. Some IHC tests (e.g., assays for ER, PR, HER2/neu) are considered class II devices with potential predictive or prognostic value. Similarly in veterinary medicine, immunohistochemical results are part of the pathology report and need to be interpreted by the pathologist (Ramos-Vara et al., 2008) .",

One of the main problems is the lack of standardization and quality control among laboratories, particularly in regard to AR. This interlaboratory lack of reproducibility is significant when dealing with prognostic markers (Mengel et al., 2002) . Interpretation of immunostaining is also subjective (wide range of interobserver interpretations), and a degree of knowledge of IHC and the antibodies used is required to interpret the results correctly. What constitutes a positive result (percentage of positive cells needed, intensity of the reaction) is still controversial, but it is a critical issue for therapeutic decisions in oncology. Some tumors do not express specific markers beyond the generic ones, which makes testing with multiple markers expensive and unrewarding. Neoplastic cells upregulate and downregulate gene expression, resulting in the lack of expression of expected antigens or the expression of new antigens. All these issues are perhaps more serious in veterinary medicine, where the degree of sophistication and use of IHC techniques is not as advanced as in human pathology, and are exacerbated by interspecies differences in antigen expression and detection.",

            "text": "There are multiple causes of background staining. A common one is inadequate blocking of serum proteins. Blocking is usually done with normal serum or protein (Brown, 2001) . Bovine serum albumin has been used extensively in the past as a blocking reagent of nonspecific reactions. However, adding albumin to antibody and diluent solutions increases the background of immunohistochemical reactions (Mittelbronn et al., 2006) . Other causes of false-positive staining are necrotic tissue, crushed cells, improper fixation, incomplete blocking of endogenous peroxidase or endogenous biotin, spurious staining of cells that have phagocytized other cells, and high concentration of the primary antibody (Dabbs, 2002; Miller, 2011; Skoog and Tami, 2011) . Samples that are too thick tend to trap reagents and produce background staining. Carcinoma cells in fluids often express vimentin and lose their immunoreactivity for cytokeratins; antigens shed into effusion fluid can be absorbed onto the surfaces of other cells present in the same fluid. Some antigens in cytologic samples such as factor VIII-rAg and immunoglobulins tend to diffuse into the surrounding tissue, contributing to incorrect interpretation of immunostaining (Barr and Wu, 2006) . To avoid overstaining due to the concentration of the primary antibody, retitration of primary antibodies on cytologic preparations is recommended. Other causes of background staining are included elsewhere (Ramos-Vara, 2005) . When using detection kits that recognize primary antibodies made in goats, extensive background in both positive and negative controls is observed if using tissue sections from the same or related species (ruminants) due to the presence of endogenous immunoglobulins recognized by the secondary antibody (anti-goat IgG). A similar problem is observed with rabbit monoclonal antibodies tested on rabbit tissues or mouse monoclonal antibodies tested on mouse tissues. Special detection procedures are commercially available to avoid this background staining. Although not an example of nonspecific background staining, it is very important in ICC to distinguish positive staining in normal or reactive cells from that in neoplastic cells (Chivukula and Dabbs, 2010) . This distinction can be challenging when the number of reactive cells is higher than that of the neoplastic cells (e.g., T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma). Other causes of false-negative staining are improper fixation, inadequate antibody titration, insufficient AR, or cell damage during slide preparation (Chivukula and Dabbs, 2010; Skoog and Tani, 2011) .",

Positive and negative controls for ICC must be performed with each test sample (Chivukula and Dabbs, 2010; Yaziji and Barry, 2006) . Although the ideal tissue (cell) control is a comparably fixed cytology sample (Chivukula and Dabbs, 2010) , in a recent review of the ICC literature, only 13% of publications listed positive and negative controls processed identically as the samples; 54% did not mention the use of controls or processed controls separately (Colasacco et al., 2010) . The College of American Pathologists recognizes the impracticality of maintaining separate positive control samples for every possible combination of fixation, processing, and specimen type (see comment for questions ANP 22550 in the Anatomic Pathology checklist at http://www.cap.org/apps/cap.portal). Cytologic control preparations fixed in acetone will lose antigenicity after several months even if wrapped in aluminum foil and refrigerated; control samples fixed in formalin retain their antigenicity indefinitely (Valli et al., 2009) . The production of cytologic controls from organs (e.g., lymph node, liver) is described elsewhere (Valli et al., 2009) . The ideal positive cell control should demonstrate immunoreactivity that is weak in some places and strong in others. A negative reagent control is also necessary for each antibody tested ( Fig. 17-2) . For the negative reagent control, either an irrelevant antibody or nonimmune serum from the same species as the primary antibody (and ideally the same Ig isotype for monoclonal antibodies) replaces the primary antibody (Fetsch and Abati, 2004) . The slide with the negative reagent control should be processed in an identical manner as the slide with the primary antibody. The negative control slide is used to assess nonspecific staining that is not the result of specific antigen-antibody binding (background staining). If only one slide is available, it may be used divided into test and negative reagent control using a commercial hydrophobic barrier pen or by using cell transfer technique (DeLellis and Hoda, 2006; Stone and Gan, 2014). In some instances, a slide negative for one marker can be used to test a second marker. See the Appendix for further information regarding these techniques.",

Table 17 -2 lists cell markers and their use in the immunochemical diagnosis of tumors, with emphasis on organ systems. In human pathology, the following expanded panel has been proposed: pancytokeratin (carcinomas), CD45 and CD43 (lymphomas), S-100 and Melan-A or gp 100 (melanomas), and vimentin and collagen IV (sarcoma) (Yaziji and Barry, 2006) . Some of these markers are not available or not reactive in animal tissues, so alternatives need to be found. Once other clinicopathologic data have been examined, judicious use of antibodies is the best approach: It will reduce both the cost of testing and the need to explain unexpected reactions to the client. Once a particular tumor group has been identified (e.g., sarcoma), more specific markers to determine the type of tumor are used. This approach is based on algorithms. Fig. 17 -3 shows a basic algorithm to characterize tumors frequently found in domestic species. This algorithmic approach is borrowed from the human experience; unfortunately, many markers currently used in human pathology are not reactive in animal tissues or their reactivity is different (in other words, when dealing with IHC, not all animal species and antibodies are created equal). The lack of predictive behavior (percentage of positive cases of a tumor with a particular antibody) is one of the most difficult barriers to overcome in veterinary diagnostic IHC.

Many antibodies with diagnostic or prognostic significance in human pathology await validation in similar tumors of animals (Capurro et al., 2003) . A similar algorithmic approach can be used in ICC. Antibody personality profile (APF) is a relatively new concept introduced by Yaziji and Barry (2006) . An APF is defined by 1) location of expected signal (e.g., cytokeratins are exclusively cytoplasmic; S-100 protein and calretinin are cytoplasmic and nuclear; CD45 and CD11 are in the cell membrane; laminin and collagen IV are found only in the interstitium); 2) antibody pattern (S-100 produces a homogeneous signal; cytokeratins, a filamentous signal; chromogranin A and Melan-A, a granular signal); 3) antibody-characteristic pattern across tissues and tumors (thyroid transcription factor-1 [TTF-1] stains most neoplastic cells in a pulmonary carcinoma; uroplakin III stains only a small percentage of tumor cells). Knowledge of the profile facilitates accurate interpretation of immunohistochemical results. Keep in mind that APF may vary among animal species , 2002b .",

This gives the diagnostician more opportunities to make a definitive diagnosis-or get more confused. Keep in mind that regardless of the number of markers used to characterize a particular tumor, the gold standard before attempting IHC should be HE. A careful examination of HE-stained slides will reduce the number of markers needed to arrive to a definitive diagnosis. Even after that, it is uncommon to make a definitive diagnosis with only one marker because expression (or lack of thereof) of proteins in tumor cells may differ from that in the normal cell counterpart. Upregulation and downregulation of gene expression and the proteins codified by such genes is common in neoplastic cells. The use of tumor marker panels in the diagnosis of metastatic disease is key to improving the chances of arriving at a definitive diagnosis. Considering the relatively low cost of IHC and the expenses of treating some tumors, clinicians are keen to get a definitive answer from the pathologist. A treatment tailored to a specific tumor will more likely improve the quality of life of the animal. The proposed series of steps to characterize a metastatic tumor has been modified from Bhargava and Dabbs (2010) and include the following: 1) Determine the cell line of differentiation using major lineage markers. 2) Determine the cytokeratin type for carcinomas and possible co-expression of vimentin.

They are separated by charge into acidic (type I) and basic (type II) keratins. Cytokeratins are paired together as acidic and basic types. Most low-molecular weight keratins (e.g., CK7, 8, 18, 20) are present in all epithelia except squamous epithelium, whereas high-molecular weight keratins (e.g., CK1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10) are typically present in squamous epithelium. Almost all mesotheliomas and carcinomas, except squamous cell carcinomas, have CK8 and CK18. The coordinate expression of CK7 and CK20 is one criterion to classify carcinomas in human pathology. This approach has proven very useful in metastatic carcinomas of undetermined origin. There is only one paper published regarding domestic animals that examines a wide range of carcinomas in dogs and cats for expression of CK7 and CK20 (Espinosa de los Monteros et al., 1999) . Results for CK7 were similar to those in humans, but major differences were observed for CK20 among both animal species. CK5 is a useful marker of myoepithelial differentiation in glandular tumors as well as for squamous epithelium and mesothelial cells. Although cytokeratins are the typical marker of epithelial differentiation, they can be detected in mesenchymal tumors (melanoma, leiomyosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, liposarcoma, meningioma, and angiosarcoma) although usually in only a few cells as opposed to the diffuse and strong staining of carcinomas and sarcomatoid carcinomas (Dabbs, 2006) .

Specific Markers. Every year, numerous scientific papers report the characterization of \"novel\" markers (antibodies) that are extremely specific for particular human cells or tumors. Most eventually will be relegated to use in combination with other antibodies (as part of a tumor panel). In this section are presented some markers that are useful in the characterization of specific animal tumors. Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1), a nuclear transcription factor, is frequently expressed in thyroid tumors (more common in follicular but also present in medullary tumors) and pulmonary tumors (Ramos-Vara et al., 2002a , 2005 . Other tumors, including mesotheliomas, are usually negative. Hepatocyte paraffin 1 (Hep Par 1) is consistently detected in hepatocytes and their tumors, with no staining of biliary epithelium, which makes it a good choice to distinguish these tumors, particularly when used in conjunction with CK7 (Ramos-Vara et al., 2001a) . However, some intestinal, and probably pancreatic, tumors can be positive (Ramos-Vara and Miller, 2002) . Melan-A is one of the best specific and sensitive markers of melanomas in dogs (less sensitive in feline melanomas) and certainly more specific than other classic markers such as S100 and NSE , 2002b . It should be noted that many steroid-producing tumors from the adrenal cortex, testis, and ovary show strong reactivity for Melan-A (Ramos-Vara et al., 2001b) . Uroplakin III, a major component of the asymmetric unit of transitional epithelium, is expressed in most canine transitional cell carcinomas and, in conjunction with CK7, the number of transitional cell carcinomas detected approaches 100% (Ramos-Vara et al., 2003) . Uroplakin III has not been detected in nonurothelial normal or neoplastic tissues of dogs except in some prostatic carcinomas (Lai et al., 2008) , which makes this marker extremely specific.",

The differential diagnosis of mesothelioma and pulmonary carcinoma is challenging in human pathology; numerous antibodies have been tested. The combination of D2-40 and calretinin (both positive in mesothelioma and negative in lung carcinoma) and CEA and TTF-1 (both negative in mesothelioma and positive in pulmonary carcinoma) antibodies is an economic way to distinguish these two tumors (Mimura et al., 2007) . Desmin is detected in reactive mesothelial cells but not in mesothelioma or carcinoma in cytologic preparations (Afify et al., 2002) . As previously mentioned, TTF-1 is a specific and sensitive marker of canine pulmonary and thyroid carcinomas. The use of CEA on animal tumors is very limited. We are not aware of D2-40 staining of mesotheliomas in animal species. The use of both cytokeratins and vimentin (usually co-expressed in mesotheliomas) is probably the best approach to distinguish mesothelioma from pulmonary carcinoma in animals (Geninet et al., 2003; Morini et al., 2006; Sato et al., 2005; Vural et al., 2007) .",

In mast cell tumors, there is good correlation between decreased survival time and Ki67 index and between the histochemical detection of nuclear organizing regions (AgNORs), which determine the rate of cellular proliferation (generation time), and decreased disease-free interval (Webster et al., 2007a) .

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex that synthesizes telomere DNA. In normal cells, telomerase is detected in male germ cells, activated lymphocytes, lens tissue, and stem cell populations but not in somatic cells. In human cancer, telomerase activity is detected in 85% to 90% of cases, and in dogs more than 90% of tumors examined have telomerase activity (Kow et al., 2006) .

If the markers of IHC are structural or secretory proteins specific for a cell or tissue, then the markers of EM are subcellular structures such as organelles or matrix constituents. EM has contributed in great measure to an understanding of the structural features of normal and pathologic tissues. Although its use has declined in the last decade and partially replaced by other techniques (e.g., IHC), EM is still a very valuable tool to reach a definitive diagnosis in some difficult cases, particularly in peripheral nerve sheath tumors, some synovial sarcomas, pleomorphic sarcomas, and mesotheliomas (Dardick and Herrera, 1998; Mackay, 2007) . New ultrastructural methods applied to biologic specimens have recently expanded the use of EM in pathology (Cheville and Staskos, 2014) . EM and IHC should be used in a complementary fashion based on the type of diagnostic problem (Fisher, 2006) . As an ancillary technique, EM raises the level of confidence in diagnoses based on light microscopy. Of the three main types of ancillary techniques currently used in veterinary pathology (EM, IHC, PCR), EM is the most mature technique-meaning that it has gone through the usual stages of development, evaluation, and stabilization as opposed to the other two techniques that are still in development or evaluation stages. As the saying goes, embrace the new techniques if they are worthy and keep the proven old ones.",

Glutaraldehyde has a slower diffusion rate than formaldehyde, and very small samples (around 1 mm 3 ) are required for optimal fixation. Formaldehyde is not an optimal fixative, but in diagnostic pathology, it is the most commonly used primary fixative for EM, particularly when ultrastructural studies are not considered initially in the diagnostic workup. Due to the impurities of commercially available formaldehyde solutions (e.g., formic acid, methanol), ultrastructural preservation is compromised.

The light absorbance and scatter properties of the cells can provide information about cell size and internal complexity/granularity, respectively, and the use of specific antibodies allows the quantification of both intracellular and surface-expressed components. The most widely used clinical application involves incubating cells with fluorescently labeled antibodies directed at surface antigens to determine the frequency of cells that express the given molecule as well as the relative expression levels on individual cells. Since antibodies can be labeled with a variety of fluorochromes that have different excitation and emission wavelengths, the expression of several surface molecules can be detected simultaneously. The major advantage of flow cytometry is that it allows the rapid and objective identification of large numbers of cells. Clinically, it is most commonly used for the analysis of hematopoietic cells in order to characterize lymphoma and various forms of leukemia and quantify cells in cases of suspected immunologic disorders.",

Anticoagulated whole blood or cavity effusions can generally be submitted directly to a flow cytometry facility for analysis. Aspirates from solid tissue can be resuspended in media with serum. In university or laboratory settings, tissue culture media such as RPMI or DMEM, buffered with HEPES and supplemented with 5% to 10% fetal bovine serum is ideal. However, in the clinic setting, 0.9% saline can be used and 10% serum from the patient, or another animal of the same species, can be added. Because a minimum of 10,000 cells are needed for each antibody combination, several tissue aspirates are needed for a complete analysis. One way to ensure a good yield of cells is to squirt the aspirate into the saline/serum suspension and rinse the hub of the needle in the suspension. The suspension fluid should appear slightly cloudy for best cell yield rather than clear. If samples are to be shipped, they must be shipped overnight with a cold pack. Cian et al.

The next step is to determine the percentage of cells within each population that expresses the markers of interest by looking at the fluorescence profile of each population. The fluorochromes used to label antibodies are excited by the laser and emit light over a narrow range of wavelengths, which can be detected by the flow cytometer. Different fluorochromes have distinct peak emission wavelengths, so antibodies conjugated to several different fluorochromes can be used simultaneously in one staining reaction. The amount of fluorescent signal detected is proportional to the number of fluorochrome molecules on the cell. The data can then be displayed as a single parameter in the form of a histogram or two parameters displayed simultaneously as a dot plot (Fig. 17-13) .

As a rule of thumb, expansion of a single lymphocyte subtype (CD4 T-cells, CD8 T-cells, or B-cells) would be considered most consistent with neoplasia (except for Ehrlichia canis infection as noted below). However, veterinary pathologists and clinical pathologists have not yet come to agreement about the criteria for making this diagnosis. For example, canine peripheral blood typically has 300 B-cells/\u03bcL. Would a B-cell count of 3000 cells/\u03bcL in the context of a total lymphocyte count of 6000 cells/\u03bcL be considered diagnostic for B-cell lymphoma/leukemia? Most likely the answer is yes, but definitive studies confirming this assumption with clinical follow-up and PARR assays are lacking. B, The two axes in this panel show the staining with isotype control antibodies -antibodies that should not bind specifically to canine lymphocytes but are conjugated with the fluorochromes used for specific staining. \"APC\" is the dye allophycocyanin, and \"FITC\" is fluorescein isothiocyanate. Two rectangular gates are drawn so that less than 1% of the cells fall within either gate (four quadrants could also be used instead of rectangular gates). C, Specific staining for CD5 (T-cell antigen) and CD21 (B-cell antigen) is shown in this panel with the gates drawn as guided by the isotype controls. It is clear, however, that a population of the CD5+ cells is co-expressing CD21, so the gate is adjusted (D) to reflect the true T-cell population. The percent age of T-cells in this sample was further verified as being 65% using an anti-CD3 antibody. E-G, Gating a population of interest. E, Forward and side scatter properties of a lymph node from a dog with B-cell lymphoma. Unlike the reactive node, two discrete cell populations are evident. F, B-and T-cell populations are identified and electronically colored so that the cells expressing CD21 are blue and those expressing CD5 are red. Using this back-gating technique, the large cells appear to be almost exclusively B-cells. This is confirmed when only the large cells are examined (G). Within the large cell population, almost 90% of the cells are B-cells (H), a finding that can be considered diagnostic for B-cell lymphoma.",

For example, Martini et al (2013) and Seelig et al (2014) reported that the loss of CD45 expression is a consistent feature of small clear cell, or T zone, lymphoma.

Addison disease usually involves expansions of B-cells, CD4 T-cells, and CD8 T-cells (unpublished observations). When cases of thymoma involve lymphocytosis, the lymphocytosis is usually characterized by expansion of CD4 T-cells, CD8 T-cells, and sometimes T-cells that express neither cell surface protein (Batlivala et al., 2010) . Ehrlichia canis, on the other hand, almost exclusively causes the expansion of CD8 T-cells that are described as having granules in their cytoplasm (Heeb et al., 2003; McDonough and Moore, 2000; Weiser et al., 1991) . These CD8 T-cells do not exhibit aberrant antigen expression, an observation that can help distinguish them from neoplastic T-cells, which can exhibit loss or gain of a variety of T-cell-associated antigens.",

Studies of canine multicentric lymphoma have consistently demonstrated that immunophenotype (B versus T) provides prognostically useful information in conjunction with clinical stage (Ruslander et al., 1997; Teske et al., 1994) . T-cell lymphomas typically have a worse prognosis than B-cell lymphomas especially in extranodal sites such as skin or liver. It is important to note, however, that there are histologic subtypes of T-cell lymphoma that have a good prognosis, and histologic subtypes of B-cell lymphoma that have a poor prognosis (Ponce et al., 2004; Valli et al., 2006) . In human medicine, surface markers have been identified to help distinguish between some histologic subtypes of lymphoma via flow cytometry. Avery et al (2014) have shown that CD4+, CD45+ T-cell lymphomas that express low levels of class II MHC demonstrated a uniformly poor prognosis. A different T-cell disorder, T zone lymphoma, can also be definitively diagnosed by flow cytometry (Seelig et al., 2014) . T zone lymphoma, unlike lymphoblastic T-cell lymphoma, is an indolent disorder, with very long median survival (Flood-Knapik et al., 2013) . Thus, simply distinguishing B-from T-cell lymphoma gives only an incomplete prognostic picture. Other testing, such as flow cytometry or histopathology assessed by an experienced hematopathologist, is important for providing accurate prognostic information.",

The neoplastic cell type in thymoma is the thymic epithelial cell, which directs differentiation of normal T-cells. During differentiation in the thymus, T-cells pass through a stage in which they co-express CD4 and CD8. The thymus is the only place such cells will be found, so their presence in a mediastinal mass of an adult dog can be considered diagnostic for thymoma ( Fig. 17-14) . After the CD4+CD8+ stage of development, but before exiting the thymus, T-cells downregulate one of the proteins. Thus, the number of circulating T-cells can be increased in cases of thymoma, but none of the cells in the blood will co-express CD4 and CD8. By contrast, lymphomas involving the mediastinum are generally T-cell but express only one or neither of the subset markers CD4 or CD8. The cells in mediastinal lymphoma are invariably large, whereas the lymphocytes in thymoma are small. Therefore, flow cytometry can usually distinguish between these two entities. Because making this distinction determines whether a patient will have chemotherapy or surgery, this is a particularly important use for this assay.",

Clonality testing is based on the observation that lymphocytes mount a diverse response to antigens, whether they are derived from the environment (such as allergens), from pathogens, or from self (autoantigens). By contrast, malignant lymphocytes are homogeneous, arising from a single transformed cell. Normal lymphocyte differentiation depends on the process of antigen receptor rearrangement; therefore, all mature lymphocytes have antigen receptor genes that have undergone VJ or VDJ rearrangement. Immunoglobulin genes are rearranged in B lymphocytes, and T-cell receptor genes \u03b1/\u03b2 and/or \u03b3/\u03b4 in T lymphocytes (Jung and Alt, 2004) . During this process (Fig. 17-15 ), nucleotides are trimmed or added between genes as they recombine, resulting in significant length and sequence heterogeneity, particularly within the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3). Further diversity within B-cell immunoglobulin genes is created by somatic hypermutation during antigen-driven B-cell activation. The end result of this differentiation is a diverse population of lymphocytes with virtually limitless antigen specificity and a large variety of CDR3 sequences and lengths. Lymphocytes derived from the same clone will have CDR3 regions of the same length and sequence. The term PARR is used to distinguish it from other types of PCR assays and from other methods of determining clonality. (It should be noted that this abbreviation was coined by Burnett et al. [2003] and is not used when referring to the same assay performed by human diagnostic laboratories.). Additional means of determining clonality in human medicine would include the amplification of BCL1-IGH and BCL2-IGH genes because the chromosomal translocation that brings the BCL and IGH loci together is relatively common in human B-cell lymphomas .",

Virtually any type of tissue can be used as a source of DNA, including blood, cavity fluids, aspirates, CSF, stained or unstained cytology preps, and tissue in paraffin blocks. The latter is the least desirable because formalin fixation degrades DNA and can result in both more false negatives and false positives. Archival samples, including old cytology slides, can be used as a source of material for retrospective analysis. randomly selected D region gene (6 in the canine genome) and a J region gene (6 in the canine genome), looping out the intervening DNA.

Since there are fewer TCR\u03b3 genes, fewer primers are needed to detect the majority of malignancies, and TCR\u03b3 is rearranged before TCR\u03b2, so will be clonal even if the malignancy ultimately expresses TCR\u03b1/\u03b2.

The laboratory should be able to carry out the assay in such a way that their results are objective and can stand alone. Specificity can be a difficult value to establish: The presence of a clonally rearranged antigen receptor gene in the absence of histologically or cytologically confirmed lymphoproliferative disease is not necessarily a false-positive result. Because of the assay's sensitivity, clonality testing can detect neoplasia before it is evident by other means. Some presentations of lymphoma, such as T zone lymphoma, are often diagnosed as lymphoid hyperplasia in the early stages. Thus, the only way to properly evaluate the specificity of the clonality assay is to assess the results in patients with good clinical follow-up for 6 months to 1 year to determine if a positive result indicates early-stage disease.",

Immunoglobulin gene rearrangements were found in 24/25 B-cell malignancies, and no T-cell receptor rearrangements found. Of the 18 T-cell malignancies studied, 14 harbored only a T-cell receptor rearrangement and one had both immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor rearrangements. Subsequent work in the authors' laboratory has demonstrated similar lineage fidelity, although reports from other laboratories (Valli et al., 2006) suggest a higher frequency of cross-lineage rearrangements (e.g., 21% of cases of marginal zone lymphoma with immunoglobulin rearrangements were reported to have T-cell receptor rearrangements). One explanation for these differences is the use of FFPE tissue for the latter studies. Because formalin fragments DNA, samples can appear clonal when they are not due to PCR amplification of the few intact cells in the sample. Cloning studies or side-by-side analysis on non-formalin-fixed tissue could help clarify the true rate of cross-lineage rearrangements.",

Therefore, it is unlikely to be applied to routine monitoring in its current form but may be useful in a research setting. MRD detection will almost certainly be replaced within the next few years by next-generation sequencing. In the latter method, all the immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes within a particular sample are sequenced and enumerated. This method will allow investigators to directly count the number of tumor cells in a sample.",

The available data clearly show that full thickness intestinal biopsy is by far the most useful diagnostic procedure for making this distinction. Only full-thickness biopsies allow the pathologist to assess the extent to which neoplastic cells have infiltrated (mucosal vs. transmural) and the size of the neoplastic cells. Both of these features, together with immunophenotype, are prognostic in feline intestinal lymphoma . However, the clonality assay may be useful in cases that are histologically ambiguous. Studies establishing the utility of PARR for distinguishing lymphoma from severe IBD are lacking; in the absence of a definitive histologic diagnosis, such a study would have to use clinical outcome as a \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of lymphoma versus IBD, and analysis of this type has not yet been carried out.",

Most translocations found in human leukemia and lymphoma involve the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus. For example, t(11;14) juxtaposes the locus encoding cyclin D1 on chromosome 11 to an immunoglobulin-enhancer sequence on chromosome 14. This translocation, which results in the overexpression of cyclin D1, is found in virtually all cases of mantle cell lymphoma (Campo, 2003) . Detection of the translocation by PCR or the overexpressed protein by IHC can be used to confirm the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma in histologically ambiguous cases. A consortium of European researchers found that the combined use of clonality determination through antigen receptor rearrangements together with detection of this and other translocations by PCR resulted in detection of a clonal population in 95% of human cases of confirmed lymphoid malignancies (van Krieken et al., 2003) .",

Mast cell tumors harboring this mutation (approximately 15% to 30% of all tumors) exhibit better responses to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor toceranib (London et al., 2009) and have a poorer overall prognosis. After the initial description of this mutation, a comprehensive analysis of mast cell tumors found that while the most common mutation is seen in exon 11, an internal tandem duplication in exon 8 and point mutations in exons 9 and 17 can also be found (Letard et al., 2008) .

The internal tandem duplication in exon 11 creates a larger PCR product of variable size (most commonly between three and 45 additional bases, [Letard et al., 2008] ). The internal tandem duplication in exon 8 is always the same, an addition of 12 bases. Thus, detection of both of these mutations is straightforward. An internal control for this assay is the presence of the wild type PCR product-almost all samples will contain non-tumor-derived DNA, which would contain wildtype c-kit. In addition, presumably the mast cells themselves have one wild type c-kit gene. The assay can be performed on tissue biopsies or aspirate biopsies, and mast cells must comprise at least 10% of the total cell numbers. Oncologists use the presence of this mutation to help choose chemotherapy; the presence of a c-kit mutation would lead to the choice of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as toceranib. C-kit mutation status has also been used to show that when patients develop mast cell tumor recurrence, or multiple mast cells at different sites, those mast cells are derived from the same clone because they harbor the same type of mutation (Marconato et al., 2014; Zavodovskaya et al., 2004) . n FIGURE 17-17 Assessment of c-kit mutation status in canine mast cell tumors.
