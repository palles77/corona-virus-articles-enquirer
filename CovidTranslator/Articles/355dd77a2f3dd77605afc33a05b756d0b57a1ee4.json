In particular, 5isopropyloxycarbonyl-6-methyl-4-(2-nitrophenyl)-2-[(7-chloroquinolin-4-ylamino)butylamino] pyrimidine depicted the lowest IC 50 (3.6 nM) value (56-fold less than CQ) against CQ R strain. Structureeactivity profile and binding with heme, m-oxo-heme have been studied. Binding assays with DNA revealed better binding with target parasite type AT rich pUC18 DNA. Most compounds were somewhat cytotoxic, but especially cytostatic. Molecular docking analysis with Pf DHFR allowed identification of stabilizing interactions.",

            "text": "Faced with the challenges of drug resistance, poor health systems, lack of affordable, safe and convenient treatment options, efficient treatment of malaria, one of the most devastating parasitic diseases, represents an unmet medical need. Malaria is a major public health concern in more than 90 countries inhabited by more than 2.4 billion people e 40% of the world's population and is responsible for almost 1 million deaths every year [1] . The majority of malaria victims in developing countries are pregnant women or children under the age of five, possessing little or no immunological protection. The disease is estimated to result in w250 million new annual infections worldwide. Though the majority of the cases and approximately 90% of the malaria deaths are found in sub-Saharan Africa, the disease is now increasing in Asia and Latin America. Malaria is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium that infects and destroys red blood cells eventually leading to death, if untreated. The persistent threat of emergence of multidrug resistant Plasmodium falciparum, universal chloroquine resistance [2, 3] , suspected resistance to artemisinins [4, 5] , and lack of effective, appropriate and affordable treatment options have given a new impetus to the research leading to broadening of the range of therapeutic targets. Thus, creating a new armamentarium of drugs with promising antimalarial activity coupled with understanding of their mode of action may lead to the development of a new generation of treatments both for malaria control and eradication.",

The mode of action of 2,4-diaminopyrimidine based drugs, typified by pyrimethamine 4 [9] and the lead compound WR99210 5 [10] is through the inhibition of P. falciparum Dihydrofolate reductase (Pf DHFR) enzyme, required for the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolate involved in the biotransformation of thymidylate synthase-catalysed deoxyuridylate to deoxythymidylate (dUMP / dTMP), through a methyl group transfer reaction during DNA biosynthesis [11e16] . In addition, a number of polyamines inhibit ornithine decarboxylase activity in P. falciparum through binding with plasmodial DNA [17, 18] . Recently, investigations in hybrid antimalarial agents, combining 4-aminoquinoline with other pharmacophore having antimalarial activity have been found to be less prone to resistance to parasite and has thus offered an effective means to overcome the problem of drug resistance.",

The in vitro anti-plasmodial activities of 10aes were determined in primary and secondary screening against CQ S and CQ R strains of P. falciparum. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 10aes are summarised in Table 2 (Fig. 1) . Evidently, the compounds have anti-plasmodial activity in the nM range and against the CQ R strain of P. falciparum, in some cases activity was found to be even superior to CQ.

In fact, compound 10m was found (Table 2) to be the most active compound of the series, against the CQ S strain. However, 10m exhibited a high resistance factor (w39) within the series but is 3.5 times less active than CQ, against the CQ R strain. Replacement of the ethyl ester with isopropyl ester (10nes), in general showed a decrease in in vitro antiplasmodial activity against the CQ S strain, although a reverse trend was observed for the CQ R strain, especially in case of 10s, 10p and 10r, where replacing C-4 phenyl by p-nitrophenyl (10s) or onitrophenyl (10p and 10r) groups, in addition to incorporating an isopropyl ester, resulted in an increase of activity in that order, rendering 10r as the most potent (IC 50 3.6 nM, 56 times more potent than CQ, Table 2 ) of all these compounds. These results are in accordance with the trend observed in case of N, N-bis(7chloroquinolin-4-yl)alkane diamines, wherein the alkyl spacer consisting of four carbon atoms showed optimum potency [24] . The better anti-plasmodial activity of phenyl-substituted pyrimidine compounds against the CQ R strain may be attributed to optimal fitting of these compounds in the active site of PfDHFR leading to a favorable conformation for p-p interaction with the heme functionality. Moreover, the introduction of a nitro substituent on the phenyl ring at the C-4 position of the pyrimidine core results in a significant increase in anti-plasmodial activity as well as resistance against the CQ R strain, although it has little effect on activities against the CQ S strain (Table 2) . Also, the corresponding o-, m-or p-nitro derivatives showed considerable variation in antiplasmodial activity ( Table 2 ). Comparison of compounds (10n, 10q, 10s) having an identical spacer reveals that the p-NO 2 substituted 10s (IC 50 175.8 nM) is more active than the o-/m-NO 2 substituted compounds 10q and 10n, respectively, but are less active than the unsubstituted ethyl ester analog 10b. Further, comparison with the butyl spacer analog suggests that o-NO 2 phenyl derivative 10r is more potent than the m-NO 2 counterpart 10o, as well as its ethyl ester analog 10c, against the CQ R strain. Compound 10r was found to be the most active compound in this series against the CQ R strain with anti-plasmodial activity (IC 50 3.6 nM), 56 times more than CQ (IC 50 201.8 nM) and comparable to artesunate (IC 50 2.8 nM) ( Table 2) .",

Thus, compound 10j displayed a 540-fold decrease in activity compared to 10b, against the CQ R strain. Likewise, 10k possessing a branched C-6 spacer depicted a decrease (IC 50 860.4 nM, Table 2 ) in activity against linear alkyl (C-7) spacer analog 10d (Table 2 ), but higher than 10j. Comparing 10j and 10k, with branched chain spacers, not only was the anti-plasmodial activity of the latter against both CQ S and CQ R strains increased, but it also showed an increased resistance factor ( Table 2 ). The replacement of linear chain spacers with o-and p-linked aryl groups (10h and 10i, respectively), led to much higher IC 50 (Table 2 ) values compared to former against CQ R strain, while only moderate activity was observed in case of 10i against CQ S strain. These findings could be attributed to the increased steric bulk (10h more than 10i) affecting the interaction of the iron center of heme with the compounds. This has been corroborated by performing the titration of monomeric heme with both 10h and 10i. 1:4 molar ratio of heme and 10i. Hence, the flexibility, chain length and steric constraints of the spacer linking quinoline moiety and pyrimidine unit seem to play a role in anti-plasmodial activity of these derivatives. Although the in vitro activity of 10aec, 10p and especially 10r (IC 50 3.6 nM) was superior to CQ (IC 50 201.8 nM) against the CQ R strain, these compounds suffer from high ClogP values (Table 2) , which are suggestive of the fact that these possess limited aqueous solubility, which in fact is not a serious limitation in view of recent advancements in formulation methods.",

With addition of increasing amount of 10r to the solution of m-oxo heme, the absorbance of Soret band (362 nm) decreased appreciably with significant red shift (362e405 nm, Fig. 5A ). The association constants and stoichiometry for both 10r and 10c were determined from titration data and are presented in Table 3 .The calculated association constant of 10r (log K 6.31) is greater than 10c (log K 6.09) and corresponds to 1:1 stoichiometry of the 10r:moxo heme complex. The comparison of association constants of 10r and 10c for monomeric and m-oxo heme reveals that both compounds bind strongly with m-oxo heme than monomeric heme and inhibit hemozoin formation by blocking the growing face of heme resulting in the observed anti-plasmodial activity. Further, all the compounds were also screened for in vitro inhibition of bhematin formation using b-hematin inhibitory assay in order to further confirm their mechanism of action based on interference with the heme detoxification process [37, 38] .",

Further, 10r showed dose dependent inhibition of bhematin formation (SI Figure S4 ) with an IC 50 value lower than those reported for CQ and quinine, thus demonstrating a better ability to interact with Fe(III)PPIX.

Additionally, interactions between aromatic nucleuses of the drug with nucleotide bases might also contribute. Binding of the plasmid DNA with CQ resulted in the elevation of the thermal melting temperature (T m ) of DNA in addition to other effects [44e47]. We therefore investigated the binding of the most active of the series, 10c and 10r toward GC rich Calf Thymus DNA (CT DNA) as well as AT rich pUC18 DNA through stepwise addition of small increments of DNA to a solution the compounds at constant concentration as well as physiological pH (Fig. 6A and B) .

Similar titration with AT rich pUC18 DNA (log K \u00bc 5.27) revealed higher affinity of 10r toward AT rich pUC18 DNA unlike CQ which is known to interact strongly with GC rich DNA [46] . The strong interaction of the pyrimidine analog with AT rich pUC18 DNA further suggests that these compounds might target parasite DNA which has unusually a high AT content [47] in addition to b-hematin inhibition.

It is worth comparing the performance of the compounds designed in this work with that of 5, using molecular docking methods. The crystal structure (PDB id: 1J3I, a structure of wild-type Pf DHFR-TS complexed with WR99210, NADPH, dUMP) was considered for molecular docking analysis. After appropriately preparing the protein structure of Pf DHFR, docking of 5 and 10r were carried out. Fig. 8 shows the top scoring binding pose of 10r in the active site of Pf DHFR. The docking score for 10r is \u00c024.5, which is much better than that of the lead compound 5 (\u00c020.1). The origin of this improvement in docking score can be traced to the increased number of stabilizing interactions between 10r and Pf DHFR, in comparison to the interactions between 5 and Pf DHFR. 10r shows hydrogen bonding interaction with Tyr170 and Asn108 residues; these two interactions are common to 10r as well as to 5. In addition, 10r shows hydrogen bonding interaction with Ser111 and Leu46 residues. These additional stabilizing interactions ensure that 10r adopts a slightly different (and improved) pose in comparison to that of 5. These improved interactions can be considered as deterministic factors for the improved anti-plasmodial activity of 10r.",

The compounds showed anti-plasmodial activity identical to or superior to CQ. Structureeactivity relationship has been drawn leading to the identification of at least one compound 10r as lead compound in this series. The tested compounds did not depict any antiviral activity and were cytotoxic. Binding interaction of representative potent compounds with heme and m-oxo heme using UVevisible and NMR experiments furnished log K values identical with CQ binding and pointed to 1:1 stoichiometry of the most stable complexes in solution. DNA (both GC and AT rich) binding affinity using absorption and spectrofluorometric data indicated stronger interaction of 10c (20 fold) than 10r with CT DNA, however, 10r showed higher affinity toward AT rich pUC18 DNA suggesting targeting of parasite AT rich DNA by 10r in addition to b-hematin inhibition as possible mode of action of these compounds. DNA melting experiments suggested primary groove binding and/or partial intercalative nature of interaction of 10c and 10r with CT DNA. Thus, the strong electrostatic interaction of newly designed pyrimidine analogs with AT rich DNA and blockage of heme polymerisation by complexation of drug with heme contribute to the observed antimalarial activity in nano molar range. Further, molecular docking analysis of 10r in the active site of Pf DHFR indicated superior binding compared to WR99210. Thus, drug 10r acts on multiple targets (Heme, Enzyme involved in biosynthesis of DNA (DHFR), parasite DNA) which accounts for its high anti-plasmodial activity.",

The cultures were naturally asynchronous (65e75% ring stage) and were maintained in continuous log phase growth in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 5% washed human A\u00fe erythrocytes, 25 mM Hepes, 32 nM NaHCO 3 , and AlbuMAXII (lipid-rich bovine serum albumin) (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) (CM). All cultures and assays are conducted at 37 C under an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 and 5% O 2 , with a balance of N 2 . Stock drug solutions were prepared in 100% DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) at 20 mg/ml. The compound was further diluted to the appropriate concentration using complete medium RPMI1640 supplemented with 15 nM cold hypoxanthine and AlbuMAXII. Assays were performed in sterile 96-well microtitre plates; each plate contained 100 ml of parasite culture (0.5% parasitemia, 2.5% hematocrit). Each compound was tested in triplicate and parasite growth compared to control and blank (uninfected erythtocytes) wells. After 24 h of incubation at 37 C, 3.7 Bq of [ 3 H] hypoxanthine is added to each well [51] . Cultures were incubated for a further 24 h before they are harvested onto glass-fiber filter mats. The radioactivity was counted using a Wallac Microbeta 1450 scintillation counter. The results were recorded as counts per minute (CPM) per well at each drug concentration, control and blank wells. Percentage inhibition was calculated from comparison to blank and control wells, and IC 50 values calculated using Graph Pad Prism 4.0. The preliminary screen uses the 3D7 strain. The compounds were tested at 6 concentrations (30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3, and 0.1 mg/ml). If the compound did not affect parasite growth at 10 mg/ ml it was classified as inactive, between 10 and 1 mg/ml, the compound was designated as partially active, and if <1 mg/ml, the compound was classified as active and was further evaluated by three-fold serial dilutions in a repeat test. For secondary screening both the 3D7 clone and the K1 line were used. The compound was diluted three-fold over at 12 different concentrations with an appropriate starting concentration based on the preliminary screen. The IC 50 is determined by a sigmoidal dose response analysis using Graph Pad Prism 4.0. For each assay, the IC 50 and IC 90 values for each parasite line were determined against the known anti-plasmodials chloroquine and artesunate.",
