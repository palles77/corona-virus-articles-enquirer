Without vaccination its productivity would not have progressed so successfully and as rapidly as it has over the last few decades. Th e reason for this is quite simple. Many infectious diseases are ubiquitous worldwide and airborne pathogens are diffi cult to control even with very good biosecurity measures. For the poultry industry the main practical method of controlling infectious diseases is vaccination.",

Live vaccines may stimulate the production of local or mucosal immunity as well as general (systemic) immunity. Multiplication of the vaccine organism in vaccinated birds is important and excretion may be helpful in producing a good fl ock immunity by bird to bird transmission. For example, cycling of vaccine virus is advantageous in achieving good fl ock immunity to IBD, ND and IB. However, cycling is undesirable with TRT or ILT. Lateral spread of vaccine virus can be very undesirable on multiage sites. For example, if AE or IB H52 strain spread into older, unvaccinated groups of birds in lay, the vaccine itself may then cause production problems. Occasionally, birds show a reaction after the administration of live vaccine, for example mild coughing or 'snicking' after NDV vaccination, indicating that the vaccine has 'taken'. Unless concurrent bacterial or mycoplasma challenge is present this mild reaction disappears in a few days time and is not a cause for concern.",

Th e day before vaccine is due to be administered, the water meter should be read hourly to determine the pattern of drinking, especially in relation to the timing of the feeders. Th is will give an idea of the best time to vaccinate the birds and also the volume of water required. In the absence of a water meter, the water consumption can be estimated by measuring the water level in the header tanks, or by other methods. (On farms where bell or trough drinkers are used the drinkers should be cleaned but not disinfected.) Water sanitizers should be withdrawn from the drinker system 2 days before vaccine is administered. 2. On the morning of vaccination the main tap to the drinker system should be turned off and the drinker system should be raised and drained. If this is not possible the birds should drink as much water out of the system as possible. It is advisable to remove the fi lters from the water line where vaccine passes through. Slime and dirt building up on fi lters can concentrate residue of sanitizers, which can reduce the effi cacy of the vaccine. When the drinkers are dry they should be raised, preferably 30-60 min prior to feeder activation. Th e vaccine should be mixed in the calculated volume of water, which is treated with milk or alternative neutralizing products if mains water is used, plus the volume of residual water within the lines (the drinker lines in a shed may contain as much as 250 L of water). Once the vaccine is mixed, each drinker line should be drained until the milk or dye-stained water is visible at the end of each line (priming of the lines). Th e vaccine can be made more visible by adding colouring food dye tablets to the mix. 3. When all the lines have been drained and primed, they should be lowered to bird level to coincide with the feeders activating. Preparation of the lines in this way ensures that birds at the far end of the water lines also receive vaccine and not just plain water. 4. Walk along the sides of the shed to stimulate birds to move towards feeders and drinkers. 5. Ensure that the main tap of the water system is reopened when vaccinated water is consumed just before the header tank runs dry. Dosing machines (proportioners) are also used for administering vaccine and are more useful where ad libitum feeding is practised, as the water consumption tends to be constant over time. If timed feeding is practised it is more eff ective to use the method described above to ensure that the majority of birds receive vaccine timed to coincide with maximum water consumption. Proportioners have their advantages and disadvantages but for certain types of poultry sheds they are the only way in which vaccines or medications can be administered. Unfortunately, the recommended concentration of milk necessary to protect the vaccine virus in the water cannot be achieved using proportioners. To achieve the recommended 2% milk concentration in the drinker lines one has to use pure skimmed milk for stock solution. Alternatively, the recommended amount of neutralizing powder or tablets per litre needs to be mixed into the stock solution.",

Two doses of killed vaccine are normally given 4 weeks apart during the rearing period, usually between 10 and 24 weeks.

Th eoretically, this opens up the possibility of a new generation of vaccines, often called recombinant DNA vaccines, in which the advantage of the safety of killed vaccines is combined with the effi cacy of live ones. Th e choice of suitable vectors is important. Th ey must be capable of being given by mass application methods and frequently must replicate in the face of maternally derived immunity. Two existing poultry vaccines, herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) and fowl pox virus (FPV), are suitable for use as vectors and experimental studies have shown that, for example, the F gene of either NDV or TRT virus can be inserted into these vectors and be expressed in the birds following inoculation of the vector and also confer protection against experimental challenge with pathogenic NDV or TRT virus respectively. Th us, the system has potential for commercial use and it is certainly attractive that protection against both the vector (HVT or FPV) and the inserted genes can be achieved in a single vaccination. However, it is still unclear whether these vaccines will have any significant advantages over existing conventional ones in, for example, the type or duration of immunity which they confer.
