Design: A cross-sectional survey using random Global Positioning System (GPS) spatial sampling conducted from the 8 August 2015 to 6 September 2015. Participants: Hong Kong residents aged 18 years or more. Method: A 19-item questionnaire was developed to assess respondents' preparedness information acquisition, communication plan, evacuation strategies, first-aid and disaster knowledge, financial resilience, and preparedness behaviors. In total, 1023 residents were interviewed at 516 GPS locations. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with preparedness behaviors, defined as having an evacuation kit in our study. Results: Television remains the key information source, both before and during disaster, with young respondents also favoring social media and the internet and elder residents preferring television and radio. Many respondents did not have adequate first-aid knowledge and few showed correct responses to a typhoon warning signal. Only 39.4% had an evacuation kit. In logistic regression, correct responses to first aid questions and a typhoon warning signal were significantly associated with kit preparation (OR 2.023, 95% CI 1.233\u22123.318, p=0.005). Residents with elderly household member(s) were significantly less likely to do so (OR 0.554, 95% CI 0.333\u22120.922, p=0.023). Conclusions: Community resilience-building programs should tailor information provision to different age groups with a focus on the family caregivers of elderly residents. There is a need to promulgate first-aid training and disaster education in the community.",

Telephone surveys are marked by a relatively low response rate [16] and surveys on a convenience sample have limited generalizability. Probabilistic spatial sampling, on the other hand, allows for a representative, random sample to be drawn from the study population. This method is a variant of cluster sampling in which the population is divided into several groups based upon geographical locations and a simple random sample is drawn from each group. This method of sampling can be accomplished using the Global Positioning System (GPS)-based methodology, which has been increasingly used around the world. [17] [18] [19] When accompanied by high response rates, surveys conducted at randomly selected GPS locations are likely to be more generalizable than telephone surveys or surveys on a convenience sample. Apart from the methodological limitations of previous studies, severe knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of Hong Kong's community disaster preparedness. For Hong Kong residents confronting disasters, little is known about their information acquisition; their communication plans; their evacuation strategies; their first-aid and disaster knowledge; their financial resilience; and their preparedness behaviors on a territory-wide basis. Our study addressed these knowledge gaps, and aimed to study the current state of community disaster preparedness and factors associated with preparedness behaviors.",

This finding indicates a need to tailor the way information is disseminated to different age groups in the response phase of the disaster cycle. Social media, which enables real-time updates and information exchange between different response agencies and the community, [32] [33] [34] has consistently been identified as a popular way of obtaining information among city dwellers in similar surveys. [35] However, its misuse can result in the dissemination of incorrect information. [36, 37] Abandoning traditional sources of information dissemination such as television and radio may preclude the authorities from reaching vulnerable populations including the elderly and disenfranchised. Over-reliance on mobile phone networks for information acquisition and communication will be an impediment in the face of cellular network failure. For instance, prolonged power outages after Hurricane Sandy paralyzed mobile phone and internet networks in New Jersey. [38] It is therefore important to maintain redundancies across a variety of communication channels. This would be particularly important in case of the most vulnerable -the elderly, and those in remote locations. Continuing to maintain public fixed line phones, as also required by the Telecommunications Ordinance, is highly advisable despite their decreasing use. [39] .",

First, a sizable portion (13.6%) of Hong Kong residents reported mobility or disability problems of their own or family members as barriers to evacuation. While evacuating the entire city may not be a realistic contingency plan, these numbers draw attention to the needs of the frail, the elderly or the disabled while planning temporary shelters or targeted evacuations. Second, 5% of the respondents had no savings at all and 5.2% had savings only enough to support their family for a period of one to two weeks. In the event of a devastating disaster that puts everyone out of a job, the government should be prepared to provide immediate financial assistance to approximately 10% of the residents. Third, the likely lack of first-aid competence and familiarity with warning signals warrants further community-focused disaster preparedness education and impact-based warning.",

Residents with correct responses to first aid questions and typhoon warning signal were more likely to have a kit. This finding is consistent with that reported from other studies that persons with more preparedness knowledge are more likely to have assembled an emergency kit. [42] Community disaster education programs may improve disaster knowledge, which in turn may influence preparedness behaviors. The UK Government distributed the Preparing for Emergencies booklet to each household in 2004. A survey conducted after the London Bombings in 2005 showed that those who recalled having received the booklet were more likely to have gathered emergency supplies, but the association was not significant for those who recalled reading it. [43] Only less than half of the respondents recalled having read the booklet, indicating the difficulty in delivering disaster education to the public. Therefore, multiple means of disaster education and repeated education are needed.",

[47] Many elderly residents are not able or willing to evacuate during emergencies. [48] Elder adults may also have multiple medical and nonmedical needs, such as medication, medical equipment that require electricity, and help with activities of daily living during evacuation.

Also this study did not reach institutionalized or homebound residents, who are more likely to be vulnerable to disasters.
