Many questions remain about the efficacy and impect of preventive measures because most existing studies report imprecise proxies of influenza incidence, do not follow subjects throughout the entire influenza season and across multiple influenza seasons, or do not control for important factors such as timing of implementation and social contact patterns. Modeling and simulation are key methodologies to answer questions regarding influenza prevention. While vaccination may be the most efficacious existing intervention, variations in circulating strains and children's immune systems keep current vaccines from being fully protective, necessitating further clinical and economic studies and technology improvements. Hand hygiene appears to be an important adjunct but improving compliance, standardizing regimens and quantifying its impact remain challenging. Future studies should help better define the specific indications and circumstances for antiviral use and the role of nutritional supplements and nonpharmaceutical interventions.",

However, in 2012, the FDA approved a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), a four-strain vaccine that includes an additional B strain, for use in people aged 2-49 years [8, 9] . Since the circulating influenza viral strains tend to change each influenza season, vaccine scientists, manufacturers and policy makers attempt to anticipate these strains prior to the influenza season and incorporate them into the vaccine. Predicting the dominant strain(s) can be difficult, so the vaccine's strains do not always match the circulating ones. Consequently, annual vaccine protection tends to vary and persist only through a single influenza season/year. Therefore, scientists have been attempting to develop a vaccine that protects over multiple years, regardless of shifting circulating strains and antigenic drift [10] . Such a vaccine would target a 'universal' or conserved portion of the influenza virus -that is, one that persists across different strains. A multiyear vaccine would also circumvent the need for yearly immunization (and the annual compliance needed) and protect the population should a novel strain, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain, emerge. Currently, the universal vaccine is in preclinical development, as testing of vaccines targeting the influenza A M2 protein has been carried out in mouse models [10] .",

Adjuvants are chemical compounds added to the vaccine to boost the host's immune response to the vaccine antigen, enhancing protection [10] [11] [12] . Only the TIV is approved for children younger than 2 years, and a 2008 Cochrane review, using data from the only randomized controlled trial (RCT) in this age group, could not confirm its enhanced efficacy [13] . Among the most extensively studied adjuvants are oil-based ones such as ASO3 and MF59, and RCTs in young children have shown promising high seroconversion rates.

            "text": "Despite years of research, much uncertainty remains about vaccine efficacy since conducting an ideal study is very difficult. Many of the problems stem from the challenges in properly diagnosing influenza cases, which requires detecting the virus in respiratory fluids via techniques such as direct antigen detection tests, cell culture, or real-time reversetranscriptase PCR (rRT-PCR), while the child is actively shedding the virus. The tests may miss a case if administered too early (e.g., during the incubation period) or too late (e.g., after the infectious period) in the disease course. Since many influenza cases are asymptomatic, identifying every case would necessitate serially screening the entire study population throughout the influenza season, which currently would be prohibitively expensive and operationally challenging. As a result, many studies have utilized more indirect outcomes such as vaccine effectiveness, which measures prevention of influenzalike illness (ILI) cases -that is, any respiratory disease that resembles influenza in symptomatology (e.g., fever, cough and myalgias), regardless of the etiologic agent (e.g., parainfluenzavirus, coronavirus and rhinovirus). Although ILI cases may be easier to identify (i.e., from a clinical constellation of systems) than influenza cases, influenza vaccine effectiveness not only includes many noninfluenza cases but also misses asymptomatic influenza cases that still can transmit the virus to others. Even when true efficacy is measured via counting the cases of culture-confirmed influenza (CCI) prevented (efficacy), the duration and intensity of follow-up can significantly affect the results. Another major obstacle is matching the influenza strains included in the vaccine with the circulating influenza strain(s) for that season. A good match can yield high efficacy whereas a poor match can lead to low efficacy. Elucidating the relationship between strain similarity (when the vaccine and circulating strains do not match perfectly) and vaccine efficacy is a continuing conundrum.",

This extensive systematic review, which included 16 RCTs, also highlighted the shortcomings of existing studies: more RCTs and cohort studies focus on ILI than on CCI, a majority screen only for symptomatic cases, and few comment on the match between the vaccine and circulating influenza.

Although there have been some reports of local skin reactions, gastritis/duodenitis, narcolepsy [24, 25] , febrile seizures [26] and rare occurrences of Guillain-Barre syndrome, no consistent trend or association has emerged. LAIV's association with increased wheezing in children with a history of asthma (or wheezing in general) and those <2 years old con-traindicates its use in these groups, but evidence supports the continued use of TIV even in children with severe asthma [5, 27] . However, despite the reassurances that existing studies have provided, there is a continuing need for better-designed safety studies, especially as new influenza vaccine candidates emerge. As the authors of a 2008 Cochrane review of the safety and efficacy of influenza vaccines have emphasized, inconsistency in the collection, presentation and availability of safety data has plagued a number of existing studies [28, 29] .",

Although TIV is less expensive, approximately $8-14 compared with $15-20 for LAIV [201] , one cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that LAIV may save $45.80 more per child aged 24-59 months compared with TIV [34] .",

Immunizing children earlier (i.e., by the end of October) could protect children for a greater proportion of the influenza season and in turn reap substantial savings for society and third-party payers in both financial cost (range: US$4.1-9.6 million) and QALYs (range: 647-942 QALYs) compared with when children currently receive the vaccine [35] . The ICER for October vaccination compared with later vaccination fell in the range of US$27,901-39,940 per QALY for TIV and US$36,538-48,282 per QALY for LAIV, indicating that earlier vaccination is cost-effective. Achieving earlier immunization may benefit not only vaccinated children by protecting them for a greater portion of the influenza season but also unvaccinated children (and adults) because rapidly attaining herd immunity (i.e., a large enough proportion of the population is protected to inhibit further spread) can curtail overall transmission in the population. Earlier immunization seems feasible as typically the manufacturers have already delivered over 70% of vaccines by October. Delays are likely to result from immunization location hours and availability, education about the benefits of earlier vaccination, procrastination and competing priorities. Another study showed that vaccines administered through the Vaccines For Children (VFC) program (which provides free vaccines to children who are uninsured or eligible for Medicaid) are given approximately 1 month later than non-VFC vaccines due to later arrival of VFC from distributors [36] .",

Administering a vaccine that could protect children (5-18 year olds) for 5 years instead of annual immunization could save US$15 million-billion over their lifetimes. Increasing the duration of protection would of course increase these savings; protection for 10 years could increase these savings to US$5-9 billion.

According to data pooled from two household-based RCTs, oseltamivir administered to people in the same household as an index influenza case was 68-89% efficacious in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza among individuals and 58.5-84% efficacious in households [51, 52] . Using data from another two householdbased RCTs, zanamivir demonstrated 80% efficacy in individuals and 72-79% efficacy in households (with one trial reporting household data only [53, 54] ). The strengths of these trials include large study population (277-487 households), rapid dissemination of antivirals for PEP (within 48 h of index case symptoms), twice-daily monitoring for influenza symptoms, and influenza confirmation through laboratory testing. Future RCTs should explore school settings as well and directly compare oseltamivir to zanamivir in household and school settings.",

As with PEP, treatment efficacy depends heavily on how early in the disease course the antiviral was administered. Once the incubation period has passed and the virus has ventured beyond the host's respiratory tract, the ability of antivirals to mitigate shedding is greatly diminished. Measuring shedding is difficult and labor intensive and following the treated child's contacts requires close monitoring. Moreover, a child's contact rates may wax as symptoms decrease (e.g., with treatment) and wane as symptoms increase. Individuals may not take the entire course of antivirals, stopping once symptoms alleviate. Finally, efficacy is tied to the age and contact patterns of the treated child. Treatment of any age group can benefit children; when any adult or child household member develops influenza, children have the highest secondary attack rates compared with other age groups [55] [56] [57] [58] . Unfortunately, to date, no RCTs have specifically addressed the efficacy of treatment in preventing influenza among children. Some published studies have analyzed this as a secondary outcome but have not convincingly demonstrated benefits [55, 59] .",

While this study is helpful in showing that PEP could be cost-effective (i.e., ICER <$50,000 per QALY) under certain circumstances, further investigation is needed. Future studies should examine how the economic value of antivirals vary with factors such as administration strategy (PEP vs treatment), timing of influenza diagnosis, timing of administration, type of person receiving antivirals, severity of influenza season, degree of resistance among circulating strains, general health of those receiving PEP or treatment and vaccination status. The last factor is especially important since it is unlikely that PEP will replace vaccination as a primary prevention measure, except in years in which the vaccine is either unavailable or ineffective.",

Growing viral resistance has neutralized the use of adamantanes and threatens oseltamivir. Zanamivir-resistant influenza strains remain relatively rare [49, 61] . Selection pressure from increasing antiviral use could increase the resistant strain prevalence, which further complicates selecting the target populations to receive PEP and treatment. The more antivirals are used for prevention (hence increasing resistance prevalence), the less efficacious they may be in treating life-threatening severe cases who have no other recourse. Therefore, recommendations should be a balance between resistance concerns and the need for preventative measures beyond immunizations. How this would translate to specific recommendations (e.g., when a child develops influenza, whom should receive PEP? Just household contacts, the child's close friends at school, or the child's entire school class?) Some observational school-based studies that combine antiviral treatment with school closure to mitigate outbreaks suggest that antivirals may help but are not enough to establish clear recommendations [62] [63] [64] . Finally, initiating PEP within 48 h of exposure and treatment within 48 h of symptoms requires rapid index case diagnosis (which may not be consistently possible with currently available diagnostics) and antiviral dissemination within a very narrow timeframe [65] .",

Linday et al. explored the impact of cod liver oil (which contains both vitamin A and D) and multivitamin supplements on pediatric visits for upper respiratory infections in children aged 6 months to 5 years [72] . The children randomized to the intervention group took the oil and supplements (together containing 600-700 IU vitamin D) for approximately 6 months while the control group received neither vitamins nor supplements. This study found no statistically significant difference in the number of pediatric visits between the two groups, but had several important limitations. Confirmed influenza was not the study's primary end point; pediatric visits can result from numerous reasons; the study did not fully account for compliance with regimen and nutritional intake among the control group or check serum vitamin D levels; and the vitamin D doses may have been too low to have benefits. Another trial by Urashima et al. compared the effects of vitamin D supplementation (1200 IU of vitamin D daily for 4 months) versus placebo on influenza A incidence in 6-15 year olds [73] . The trial found a statistically significant decrease in influenza A incidence in the intervention group (10 out of 167 [10.8%] of the intervention group compared with 18 out of 167 [18.6%] of the placebo group for a 41.9% protective efficacy). Although the study had limitations (e.g., baseline vitamin D levels were not assessed), these results should motivate follow-up studies to determine their reproducibility. Evidence for other nutritional supplements is even scarcer. Since supplements often do not face the same regulation as medical products, supplements may have poorer quality control and include contaminants that may pose safety concerns. The safety and efficacy of supplements are important areas for future investigation.",

NPIs physically separate susceptible children from the virus and infectious individuals. Social distancing measures remove susceptible children from the vicinity of infectious individuals. Isolation involves restricting the contacts of an individual who is known to be infectious. Quarantine entails restricting the contacts of individuals who have been exposed to an infectious individual. Other social distancing measures include closing locations of high mixing, such as schools or daycare centers.",

If infectious individuals have no chance of contacting susceptible individuals, there should be no chance of transmission and spread (one caveat is that transmission can occur via surfaces and objects such as tabletops and doorknobs). In reality, social distancing measures are rarely perfectly executed. Typically, there are delays in identifying infectious cases and their contacts and implementing measures. Social distancing measures often are only partially implemented. For isolation and quarantine, completely eliminating contact with a child is practically impossible. Young children need to be fed and bathed; older children may chafe at being kept from contacting others; and closing high mixing locations such as schools may simply shift mixing locations to movie theaters, malls, playgrounds, parties and so on.",

            "text": "As conducting a RCT of social distancing measures is an ambitious task, most of the available evidence comes from observational studies during outbreaks and epidemics and modeling and simulation studies. School closures have been the most extensively studied social distancing measure. Wu et al. followed transmission of the 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 in schoolchildren in Hong Kong, where primary schools closed for 4 weeks due to the pandemic, followed by summer vacation in primary and secondary schools [79] . During the periods of school closure, there was an estimated 70% reduction in intra-age group transmission. The estimated population-wide reproductive rate (R 0 ) -that is, the number of additional cases generated by an index infectious case -was 1.7 before school closure and declined to 1.1 by the end of summer vacation. While school closure may abate an outbreak, if the strain remains in the general population, the outbreak may resume once schools reopen. Wheeler et al. analyzed Arizona children over 4 consecutive school years and found that influenza incidence among the school-age population remained constant during winter breaks (when schools closed), but increased significantly after the winter break when schools reopened [80] . Similarly, in their study of Mexican schoolchildren during the 2009 pandemic [81] , Chowell et al. built a transmission model and found that during spring school closure, the overall population influenza spread decreased by approximately 29.6%. The ratio of student cases to nonstudent cases remained low during summer vacation but climbed once schools reopened.",

            "text": "As with other influenza interventions, all school closures are not the same monolithic intervention. Timing of school closures (both when school closure is initiated and concluded) seems essential to its efficacy; closure must occur early enough to prevent cases. As Cowling et al. found in Hong Kong [82] , school closures that occurred after influenza attack rates had already peaked had no significant effect on transmission in children. Similarly, in their study of school closure in rural Pennsylvania, Cauchemez et al. [83] determined that school closure was initiated after 27% of schoolchildren already had influenza symptoms and did not reduce influenza transmission among children. Several other models have attempted to identify thresholds of ill children at which schools should be closed to prevent an influenza outbreak but assumed indefinite school closure [84, 85] . Lee et al. showed the importance of school closure duration and that short closure durations could actually worsen an influenza outbreak [86] . School closure keeps a large segment of potential high mixers susceptible to influenza. If schools are reopened while the outbreak persists in the community, the sudden remixing of susceptible children with infectious individuals could simply refuel the outbreak, causing a new surge in cases. Therefore, once the decision to close schools is made, it may be important to maintain school closures until the outbreak has subsided, which in the case of a large epidemic can be over 8 weeks. This has tremendous implications from an economic standpoint, as will be detailed later.",

In addition to teaching children, schools employ teachers and other staff, care for students during the day while their parents are at work, and provide meals and other activities. Shutting down a school interferes with teacher, parent and other caregiver productivity. As Brown et al. demonstrated, the tremendous cost associated with school closure would dwarf the costsavings from preventing influenza-associated medical costs under 2009 H1N1 pandemic circumstances; an 8-week school closure would cost a median US $14,000-25,000 per influenza case averted, far higher than vaccination (< US $100 per influenza case averted) [1] . This suggests that long-term school closure to quell a large-scale epidemic would not be cost-effective and merited unless morbidity and mortality were much higher than in the 2009 pandemic. The cost-effectiveness of short-term school closure as a means to stem a much smaller outbreak remains an open question.",

One recent large RCT enrolled 20,882 elementary school students and compared an intensive hand hygiene campaign to standard practice in elementary schools in Egypt using both ILIs and CCIs as end points [107] . In the intervention group, ILI-attributable absences decreased by 40% (p < 0.0001) and laboratory-confirmed influenza rates fell by 47% (p < 0.0001) [107] . These promising results may underestimate the benefits of hand washing since in the subset of students who were absent due to ILIs, fewer students in the control group (12%) underwent influenza testing compared with the intervention group (22%), potentially leading to case undercounting in the control group. By contrast, a 2011 cluster RCT by Stebbins et al. enrolled 3360 children to examine the impact of an intensive hand hygiene intervention on influenza A and influenza B acquisition in elementary school students in Pittsburgh (PA, USA) [104] . The study found no significant difference in total CCI cases between the intervention and control groups, a reduction of influenza A cases by 52% (p < 0.02) in the intervention group, and no reduction in influenza B cases [104] .",

However, hand hygiene appeared to have no significant effect on transmission, regardless of timing. Larson et al. found no differences in ILI/influenza secondary attack rates when randomizing US households with a sick individual to one of three groups: education only, education plus hand sanitizer, or education plus hand sanitizer plus surgical facemasks [111] .

            "text": "\u2022 Healthy children are high transmitters of influenza and can experience poor influenza outcomes.\u2022 Many questions remain about the efficacy and impact of preventive measure because many existing studies report imprecise proxies of influenza incidence (e.g., influenza-like illness incidence), do not follow subjects throughout the entire influenza season and across multiple influenza seasons, and do not control for many important factors such as timing of vaccination and social contact patterns.\u2022 The limitations of clinical studies make modeling and simulation key methodologies to answer questions regarding influenza prevention.\u2022 While vaccination may be the most efficacious existing intervention, variations in circulating strains and children's immune systems keep current vaccines from being fully protective, necessitating further clinical and economic studies and improvements in vaccine technology.\u2022 Evidence suggests that live attenuated influenza vaccine may be more efficacious among young children (with less pre-existing immunity) than trivalent influenza vaccine, which may translate to being either comparable (due to higher pricing) or slightly more cost effective than trivalent influenza vaccine.\u2022 Hand hygiene appears to be an important adjunct but improving compliance, standardizing regimens and quantifying its impact has been challenging. Additional evidence could help guide its implementation.\u2022 The efficacy of antivirals in preventing influenza depends heavily on its early administration and resistance among circulating strains. Therefore, future studies need to help define the specific indications and circumstances for their use.\u2022 More studies could better define the role of nutritional supplements and nonpharmaceutical interventions such as school closure, isolation, quarantine and wearing protective garb.\u2022 Better characterization of children's social contact patterns and influenza transmission dynamics can assist in addressing all of the above issues.",
