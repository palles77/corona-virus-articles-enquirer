Restriction enzymes digestion and sequence analysis indicated the recombinant plasmid of pTRE-Tight-SARS-N contained the nucleocapsid gene with the optimized nucleotide sequence which will improve the translation efficiency. Positive cell clones were selected by cotransfecting pTRE-Tight-SARS-N with the linear marker pPUR to BHK-21 Tet-on cells in the presence of puromycin. A set of double-stable eukaryotic cell lines (BHK-Tet-SARS-N) with inducible control of the SARS-CoV neucleocapsid gene expression was identified by using SDS-PAGE and Western-blot analysis. The expression of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was tightly regulated by the varying concentration of doxcycline in the constructed double-stable cell line. The constructed BHK-Tet-SARS-N cell strains will facilitate the rescue of SARS-CoV in vitro and the further reverse genetic research of SARS-CoV.",

As reported, the cloned SARS-CoV nucleocapsid gene encoded 426 amino acids, deduced molecular weight was 46 350.46 Daltons; There are 61 strongly basic (+) amino acids (K,R), 36 strongly acidic (-) amino acids (D,E), 102 hydrophobic amino Acids (A,I,L,F,W,V), 138 polar amino acids (N,C,Q,S,T,Y). The 1.3 kb fragment was recovered and ligated with the pTRE-Tight vector which was digested with the same restriction enzyme BamH I and Not I. The pTRE-Tight is a response plasmid that can be used to inducibly express the interest gene in the Tet-On stable cell lines [6] . The recombinant plasmid pTRE-Tight-SARS-N was constructed by transforming competent TOP10 cells with the ligation mixtures, the positive clone was selected using the antibiotic (Amp + ) and the restriction enzyme digestion. As shown in Fig.2, after digested with restriction enzyme BamH I and Not I, the positive plasmid DNA have two bands, one is the 2.6kb vector band (pTRE-Tight), and one is the 1.3kb SARS-CoV nucleocapsid gene. This result showed the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid gene was inserted into the MCS (multiple clone sites) of pTRE-Tight, which will be responsive to the regulatory proteins in the Tet-On cell line.",

In order to construct the double-stable cell lines which express SARS-CoV nucleocapsid gene, the positive plasmid pTRE-Tight-SARS-N were cotransfected to the BHK-Tet stable cell and with the linear antibiotic marker pPUR. pPUR is a short, purified linear DNA fragments comprised of the antibiotic marker gene, an SV40 promoter, and the SV40 polyadenylation signal.",

After 2 weeks, only in the dishes with 1\u03bcg/mL puromycin, large, healthy colonies were formed. 30 healthy, isolated cell colonies were picked and expanded in individual plates with 1\u03bcg/mL puromycin. These expanded cell colonies were called double stable cell BHK-Tet-SARS-N. The tightly regulation of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid gene expression in double-stable cell lines The double-stable BHK-Tet-SARS-48 h in 37\u2103, the cells were harvested and run SDS-PAGE gel. As expected, there were very low background SARS-N protein expression in the constructed BHK-Tet-SARS-N cell strains. The molecular weight of expressed SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was about 46 kDa, can specifically react with the anti-SARS-N primary antibody. The expression was tightly regulated by the concentration of doxcycline. As shown in Fig.4, the expression level of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein is low in the BHK-Tet-SARS-N cell clones without doxcycline, even can't be detected by Western-blot in some cell clones (such as clone 1,3 in Fig.4); With the improvement of different dose doxcycline, some clones exhibited at least 20-fold induction (such as clone 2,4 in Fig.4). Because the level of expression is profoundly affected by the site of regulator protein (rtTA) integration, we isolate and analyze as many as 30 clones to obtain two (clone 2,4) Western-blot analysis of four double-stable cell clones. The cells were cultured in the presence of varying concentration of doxcycline (0mg/mL, 0.01mg/mL, 0.1mg/mL, 1mg/mL). The Anti-SARS-N protein mouse antisera was used as primary antibody and the goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP as secondary antibody. that exhibits suitably high induction and low background. This two clones were expanded and frozen as double-stable BHK-Tet-SARS-N cell strains , can be used for the rescue of SARS-CoV RNA.
