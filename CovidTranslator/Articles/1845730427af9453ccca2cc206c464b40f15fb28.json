            "text": "Coronaviruses and arteriviruses are families of positive strand RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of an infected cell. Due to similar genome organisation, replication and transcription strategies these viruses are grouped together into the Nidovirales. Many of their members cause important respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive diseases. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] , a zoonotic infection of humans and animals, and the arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) that causes reproductive failure in pregnant sows, high mortality in piglets and respiratory disease in pigs of any age [2, 3] . Although vaccines to a number of coronaviruses and arteriviruses exist, the high mutation rates during virus replication leads to new viral threats that are constantly emerging [4] . A more molecular understanding of viral protein function would allow the development of new vaccines, identify targets for targeted antiviral therapy and provide robust diagnostics [5, 6] .",

For both the coronaviruses and arteriviruses the N protein is one of the most abundant virally encoded proteins and plays essential roles in the virus life cycle [11, 12] . Its most prominent role is complexing with viral RNA, although the mechanisms for this for either type of viral N protein is not precisely characterised. For the coronavirus N protein phosphorylation has been shown to play a role in mediating binding to RNA [13, 14] with the amino-terminal region facilitating long-range non-specific electrostatic interactions potentially allowing contacts to form via a 'lure' and 'lock' mechanism [15] .",

This includes a disordered unstructured region at the N-terminal end that is followed by the structured N-terminal domain (NTD). A disordered serine/ arginine-(SR-) rich region is located in the central position of the coronavirus N protein. Similarly the extreme C-terminus is disordered with a proximally structured C-terminal domain (CTD). The arterivirus N proteins are smaller in size with regard to molecular weight (the coronavirus N protein is approximately 45 kDa whereas the arterivirus N protein is approximately 15 kDa) and consists of an N-terminal half that is mainly disordered and a structured C-terminal half which has a similar fold as the CTD of the coronaviruses [16] . Due to the abundance of disordered regions in combination with proteolytic instability of the full length N proteins [17] the detailed structure of the N protein has not been solved in entirety using any one single technique and our picture of this is based on multiple complementary analyses.",

There is a very high overall similarity between the CTD of EAV and PRRSV N proteins. The main differences exist in 0006-291X/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.11.126 their b-loops and their most C-terminal a-helices that end about 6 residues before the C-terminus. Monomers of EAV and PRRSV N harbour two anti-parallel b-strands that are flanked by two ahelices. Both proteins contain another short a-helix towards the N-terminal of the CTD. Moreover, PRRSV as well as EAV N are predicted to contain an a-helix within their otherwise unstructured N-terminal half. Similar to the coronavirus N proteins EAV and PRRSV N form dimers with a b-sheet platform that is surrounded on one side of the dimer by the a-helices. With a view to potential RNA binding or other interactions taking advantage of electrostatic interactions, the electrostatic potential is more positive on the side of the dimer on which the helices reside. The proposed RNA binding region of the PRRSV N protein, based on the structure, is in the unstructured N-terminal half, located within a region harbouring positively charged residues. With a negative electrostatic potential found on the side of the b-sheet floor this could support correct positioning of the RNA in complex to N protein. PRRSV N is found in a head to head helical arrangement within the crystals, supporting the ribbon-like pattern observed for N using cryo-tomography [20] .",

However, only equivalents of Cys23 and Cys75 are present within N proteins from European PRRSV strains. Cys23 and Cys90 may play an important role for in the virus life cycle as substitution of these residues with serine in recombinant infectious virus led to abrogation of progeny virus production [25] . To determine whether the cys residues had possible roles in mediating RNA binding, N protein was purified under reducing conditions and resulted in less RNA being co-purified (Fig. 3A) . This indicated that the formation of disulphide linkages may play a role in RNA binding. Examination of the predicted N protein structure ( Fig. 2A) indicated that Cys75 and Cys90 are too far away from their partners in the partial crystal structure to form disulphide bridges [19] . The possible role of Cys23 in RNA-binding was investigated by substituting this residue with serine (mutant N C23S ), and resulted in co-purification of no or very small amounts of RNA (Fig. 3B) .",

Multi-valency is a known means to increase the affinity of low affinity binding partners [26] [27] [28] . The suggested arrangement of N protein in the ribonucleocapsid leads to the close proximity of the positively charged regions surrounding the a-helix within the NTH of the protein [20, 29] . Cys23 is contained within this a-helix and therefore may stabilize this arrangement upon formation of disulphide bridges. Alternatively, mutation of Cys23 may have disrupted other functions of the protein in terms of overall structure and underlying RNA binding signals.",

The alanine block of mutant N 21-30 is not located within the previously identified RNA binding region. However, it is located within the predicted a-helix within the NTH of the protein ( Fig. 2A) . Moreover, mutant N 21-30 harbours Cys23 whose mutation affects RNA binding. Also mutant N 111-123 did not co-purify any RNA.
