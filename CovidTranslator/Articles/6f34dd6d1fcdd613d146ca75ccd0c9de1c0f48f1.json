The more severe cases are diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) based on oxygen requirement near term corrected gestational age. However, infants born at less than 32 weeks who do not develop BPD and those born moderate to late pre-term, 32 to< 37 weeks gestation, also have an increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms and rehospitalization due to respiratory problems during their first year of life as well as a greater degree of respiratory symptoms at preschool age. (2, 3) Viral respiratory infections contribute to poor respiratory outcomes and are the most common pathogens identified in children under the age of 18 years hospitalized for community acquired pneumonia. (4) In addition to well documented outbreaks, a prior surveillance study suggested a high burden of on-going respiratory viral infections in preterm infants born at less than 32 weeks gestation while they are still hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).(5) NICU infections with human rhinovirus also have been described in both extremely and moderately preterm infants and postulated as a cause of significant respiratory morbidity. (6) A recent report identified respiratory viral infections in a number of clinically significant systemic illnesses in the NICU population and suggested that testing for viral respiratory pathogens may be helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of infants developing signs of sepsis after the first 72 hours of age (late-onset sepsis). (7) We sought to determine the full extent of viral respiratory infections in the extremely to moderately preterm population in the NICU and during the first four months following discharge from the hospital. This study is part of a larger study of infant immune system development and respiratory function (Prematurity, Respiratory outcomes, Immune System and Microbiome [PRISM] study) that is part of the Respiratory Pathogens Research Center at the University of Rochester. We hypothesized that the risk of respiratory viral infections in pre-term babies in the NICU was significantly lower than term infants residing in the community. Secondarily, we hypothesized that the rate of respiratory viral infections in preterm infants would rise to match the term infants' rate of infection once they were discharged from the NICU. read English. In addition, term infants were not eligible if they were admitted to the NICU for any period of time, and preterm infants born at 36 0/7 weeks through 36 6/7 weeks gestation were excluded because they were not routinely admitted to the NICU. Parents were approached within 24-72 hours of birth and all newborns were enrolled by 7 days of life. The Research Subjects Review Board of the University of Rochester approved the study and all parents provided informed consent.",

For the NICU versus community comparison, time to first infection was calculated as the interval between birth date and infection date for the first infection for pre-term babies and discharge date and infection date for term babies. For the comparison of both cohorts in the community, time to first infection was the interval between discharge date and infection date. Time to repeat infection was the interval between previous and current infection dates. Log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier non-parametric estimation of infection-free probability curves were used to compare days to infection between groups, e.g., cohort (pre-term versus term), sex (female versus male), and others. Further, the intensity model (29) using the model-based covariance estimate and coupled with stepwise variable selection was used to explore the effect of demographics and to account for within-subject correlation.

Coronavirus 4 was identified by the clinical lab and in the study sample the following day. The third infant underwent a sepsis evaluation for bacterial infection nine days before hRV was identified in a study sample. Worsening respiratory function prompted the sepsis investigation that included a tracheal aspirate for bacterial culture. Mycoplasma culture but no viral diagnostic studies were performed and the symptoms were attributed to evolving BPD when all routine cultures were negative. A weekly study specimen obtained four days before the sepsis evaluation was negative for respiratory pathogens. At the time of hRV identification no specific symptoms were noted in the infant. The fourth infant had influenza B identified in a weekly sample, had not undergone a sepsis evaluation in the prior three months and was clinically asymptomatic.

            "text": "Another potential limitation is the frequency of sample collection. We obtained nose and throat samples from our population once weekly while in the NICU and this may have led to a decreased detection rate. Previous studies have shown that respiratory samples obtained from the nasal turbinates with a flocked swab have similar sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates and that adding a throat swab to a nasal swab improves the detection of respiratory viruses. (33, 34) In addition, viral identification by PCR is highly sensitive and the TAC platform has been shown to have at least equivalent detection of viral nucleic acid as other commercially available detection systems. (12) Prior studies also have identified extended periods of shedding of respiratory viruses (\u22657 days), especially in younger age cohorts, suggesting that our sampling should have been sufficient to identify infections in our NICU population. (5, (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) Our pre-and postdischarge TAC platform and sampling techniques were identical and readily detected viral infections in both term and preterm infants after discharge, supporting the study design. A further limitation is that we did not obtain respiratory samples specifically at the time of suspected sepsis while the pre-term infants were in the NICU and our sampling schedule differed between hospitalized infants and those living in the community. Nevertheless, our data suggest that weekly sampling was sufficient to identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in hospitalized pre-term infants. Once living in the community the monthly sampling schedule likely missed asymptomatic infections in both pre-term and term infants. However, as the schedule was the same between these two groups and we were comparing the infection rates between them, we do not believe this limitation substantially changes our results.
