The GP contains two subunits, GP1 and GP2, linked by a disulfide bond, which are responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. In this study, the full length of GP gene of Ebola Zaire species, 2028 base pairs in length, was synthesized using 38 overlapping oligonucleotides by multiple rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The synthesized GP gene was shown to be efficiently expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, an efficient HIV-based pseudotyping system was developed using the synthetic GP gene, providing a safe approach to dissecting the entry mechanism of Ebola viruses. Using this pseudotyping system and mutational analysis, the role of the charged residues in the GP2 helical regions was examined. It was found that substitutions of the most charged residues in the regions did not adversely affect GP expression, processing, or viral incorporation, however, most of the mutations greatly impaired the ability of GP to mediate efficient viral infection. These results demonstrate that these charged residues of GP2 play an important role in GP-mediated Ebola entry into its host cells. We propose that these charged residues are involved in forming the intermediate conformation(s) of GP in membrane fusion and Ebola entry.",

This structural feature is shared by several viral fusion proteins such as HA2 of influenza virus, gp41 of human immunodeficiency virus, suggesting a common membrane fusion mechanism mediated by different viral glycoproteins.

One possible reason for the lack of effort or interest is that the six helical bundle structures, for example, the core GP2 structure of Ebola, do not give clues regarding the role(s) of the most charged residues. We reasoned that these residues of Ebola GP2 might play important roles in protein folding and function in membrane fusion and viral entry. Indeed, most of the substitution mutants of the charged residues in the regions greatly impaired the ability of GP to mediate Ebola entry, even though these mutations did not appear to grossly affect expression, processing, and incorporation into viral particles (Fig.4) . Therefore, the current study and that a C-terminal peptide of GP2 was not as effective as that of gp41 in inhibiting membrane fusion and viral entry (34) .

The other four substitutions, C1093G, A1142G, A1231G, and C1421T, lead to amino acid substitutions of L365V, K381R, T411A, and A474V, respectively.

Deletion of this region by others (13, 14, 22, 33) and us (unpublished data) indicated that the mucin-like region of GP1 can be deleted without affecting viral entry. Therefore, these substitutions are not corrected.

Forty-eight hours post incubation, the luciferase activity of these cells was determined as a measure of viral infection. As expected, the EnvA pseudotyped HIV did not infect any of these cells since they do not express the receptor for ASLV-A, Tva{Bates, 1993 #426}. Thus the level of luciferase activity was used as the background in 000 fold in 293T cells, 500 fold in Hela cells, and less than 100 fold in Cos-7 cells, respectively, of luciferase activity over the background (Fig. 2B). However, this cell-dependent discrepancy in viral infection is not a unique property of the GP-mediated viral infection since the VSV-G pseudotyped HIV virions displayed the same trend (Fig. 2B). Nevertheless, our results showed that the synthetic EBOZ GP gene is fully functional in mediating viral infection, as expected. Because 293T and Hela cells gives much higher signal to background ratio, these cell lines were used in the infection experiments in this study. Substitutions of the charged residues in the GP2 helical regions abrogated viral entry The core structure of the EBOZ GP2 is a long three-stranded coiled-coil surrounded by an extended linker and a shorter C-terminal helices that pack in an antiparallel orientation into the hydrophobic grooves formed by the central coiled-coil (19, 39).

Sequence divergence among the charged residues of the different Ebola species are shown on the top of the membrane fusion function of this protein (34). In contrast, the role of the charged residues within the helical regions of Ebola GP2 in viral entry has not been reported. Sequence alignment of the GP2 proteins among different Ebola species indicates that almost all of the charged residues in the helical regions are conserved. For example, all of the charged residues within the N-helix are conserved, and all except two in the C-helix are also conserved (Fig. 3A).",

In contrast, mutations in the linker or the C-terminal helical regions exerted various degrees of effect. In the linker region, three substitution mutations (D607A, E611A, and H613A) had less effect (more than 20% of wt GP) than the other three mutants (R596A, H602A, and D614A). It is likely that the impaired incorporation of D614A (see Figure 4A) is responsible for its inability to mediate viral entry.

Substitution of D614 by another acidic residue, glutamate, appeared to have some adverse effect on viral incorporation (Fig. 5A, viral lysate, lane 3), but greatly impaired the ability of GP to mediate viral infection (less than 15% of wt GP, Fig. 5B). Substitution of D614 by arginine, a basic residue, reduced the efficiency of viral incorporation (Fig. 5A, viral lysate, lane 4), and abolished the ability of GP to mediate viral entry (Fig. 5B).

Thus this finding raises an intriguing possibility that these charged residues may play an important role in forming the intermediate conformation(s) in membrane fusion and Ebola entry.

The structural similarity of the core GP2 trimers to other class I fusion proteins suggest a common fusion mechanism shared by Ebola and other viruses (8). However, different class I fusion proteins display a great diversity in primary sequences in the helical regions which are involved in formation of the six helical bundles. This sequence divergence may suggest that different fusion proteins use different strategies in activating fusion proteins and in forming the intermediate conformations in membrane fusion and viral entry.
