Materials and Methods: This retrospective study enrolled all patients admitted to a 12-bed SARS intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary care medical center in Taipei between May 15 and July 17, 2003. Patients with positive results of either reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or antibody to SARS coronavirus were defined as SARS cases and others with negative results as control cases. Results: Of the 50 patients, 14 had confirmed SARS. Demographics were similar between the 2 groups. The highest leukocyte and neutrophil counts, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase; positive endexpiratory pressure; and use of corticosteroids, ribavirin, and intravenous immunoglobulin were higher in the SARS group. In contrast, the lowest lymphocyte count and the ratio of PaO 2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen were lower in the SARS group. Of the 15 deaths in the control group, 12 (80%) occurred during the first 2 weeks after ICU admission. However, in the confirmed SARS group, 5 (55.6%) of the 9 deaths occurred within the third or fourth week. This difference in timing between these 2 groups was significant (P = .004). Conclusions: In a SARS ICU, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS had significantly different clinical features and timing of mortality from those of the control group.",

Most of the patients with SARS were treated in major tertiary teaching hospitals with isolation rooms in Taipei. During this period, contact history was difficult to determine. Because of fear of further disease spread and concerns over possible legal liability, the clinicians tended to raise the suspicion of SARS. By the WHO definition and after reconfirmation by government expert teams, there were 664 SARS probable cases from late February to June, 2003, in Taiwan [4] . Of these cases, only 346 (52.1%) patients had tested positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antibody to SARS CoV. This detection rate was remarkably lower than that reported by others (85%-97%) [5, 6] . This overreporting of SARS cases was even more striking in critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities whose radiographic pulmonary infiltrations were commonly attributed to underlying diseases.",

Actually, up to 28% to 54% of patients with SARS were HCWs [7] [8] [9] . Under these circumstances, case isolation and contact precautions must be strictly carried out during outbreaks. According to our observation and those of others [15] , health care was inevitably delayed while awaiting the HCWs to put on their protective clothing. And when patient management is emergent and crucial, as is the case when critically ill patients with SARS are involved, this delay may, at least to some extent, influence patient outcomes.

Although both RT-PCR and serologic tests for SARS CoV are more specific and valuable to the SARS diagnosis, there are limitations in their clinical use. Peiris et al [6] found that SARS CoV RNA detection by RT-PCR testing in the nasopharyngeal aspirate has a sensitivity of only 32% in week 1 of infection. Although the sensitivity of a single specimen examination can increase to 68% by day 14 [6] , it is still too low to reliably document SARS infection. Therefore, testing of at least 2 different clinical specimens or the same clinical specimen collected on 2 or more days is recommended to increase the sensitivity of RT-PCR test. In addition, although the sensitivity of serologic testing was reported as high as 93% by day 28 [2, 6, 17] , this delay in SARS diagnosis inevitably decreases the diagnostic rate in the early phase of SARS infection and the turnover rate in an isolation ICU. In our study population, 12 (80%) of 15 of the deceased control patients died within 2 weeks after ICU admission. Possibly, SARS might have been ruled out in some of the deceased control patients by false-negative findings. Fortunately, clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs, blood, and stool) were routinely collected in the SARS ICU, which would, at least in part, increase the accuracy of SARS testing. The need to interpret all laboratory diagnostic test results in the context of clinical and epidemiological findings has been suggested. Therefore, early recognition of the characteristic clinical features of critically ill patients with SARS isolated in the ICU should be stressed.",

Only 14 (28%) of the 50 patients in our study were confirmed SARS cases, and laboratory testing failed to identify SARS in 72% of SARS ICU patients, which supported the suggestion by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control that overreporting was very common. Taiwan Centers for Disease Control case cluster data indicated that RT-PCR and serologic testing failed to document SARS in 318 (48%) of 664 of reported SARS cases [4] . This overreporting might have been due to several factors. Severe acute respiratory syndrome was a newly emerging infectious disease that was unfamiliar to us. Moreover, the contact and travel histories of patients were not easily established in the chaos that followed the SARS outbreak. In addition, other diseases shared features of the SARS case definition (such as radiologic finding of lung infiltration, fever [temperature, N38\u00b0C], lymphopenia, and elevated LDH level). The ambiguity of symptoms made the diagnosis even more difficult among the critically ill patients in our SARS ICU ( Table 2) . For example, Peiris et al reported that watery diarrhea occurred in 73% of patients with SARS, which was different from our result and those of others [7, 9] . In our present study, watery diarrhea occurred in only 35.7% of patients with SARS but more frequently (69.4%) in control patients in our SARS ICU. Furthermore, physicians who delayed or failed to report probable or suspected SARS cases would be accused of criminal incompetence in Taiwan. Actually, one hospital president in Taipei who delayed the report of an in-hospital SARS outbreak was sentenced to 3 years in prison in September, 2004. Overreporting consequently increased and in turn overloaded not only the health care system but also the whole society.",

Lymphopenia, defined as a blood lymphocyte count of less than 1000 \u03bcL \u22121 , is a common finding in patients with SARS [5, 6, 9] . In the present study, we found that lymphopenia was common in the whole study population but more severe in patients with confirmed SARS. Nonetheless, the lowest lymphocyte count in our control group was still as low as 661 \u03bcL \u22121 (Table 3) . Therefore, we suggest that lymphopenia used to establish a diagnosis of SARS in the critically ill might be lowered to a lymphocyte count less than 500 \u03bcL \u22121 . Third, high serum levels of LDH and CK could be used as clinical diagnostic criteria and predictors of poor outcome in SARS. High LDH level (N3.8 \u03bckat/L) has been suggested to be a predictor of poor outcome among patients with SARS [5, 7] . Previous studies of critically ill patients with SARS found that nonsurvivors had significantly higher serum levels of LDH and CK than survivors, which suggested that both LDH and CK data could help predict SARS outcomes [11, 12] . Our present study agrees with these previous studies and found in addition that LDH and CK levels were significantly higher in patients with SARS than in critically ill, control patients. Besides their negative prognostic effect on survival, high serum levels of LDH and CK can be effective clinical diagnostic criteria for SARS in critically ill patients. In addition, blood lactate and glucose levels were significantly higher in our SARS group than in our control group.",

            "text": "Fourth, our present study (unlike other studies) [5, 6, 9] found critically ill patients with SARS had markedly higher WBC and neutrophil counts. We think that the use of corticosteroids and concomitant bacterial or fungal infections might contribute to this result. Several reports have advocated aggressive and earlier use of corticosteroids in patients with SARS, especially those who were deteriorating rapidly [11, 12, 18] . So et al [18] proposed a standard treatment protocol for SARS consisting of ribavirin, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, and high-dose methylprednisolone (3 mg/kg/d for 5 days, followed by 11-day tapering, and with pulsed therapy of 500 mg twice daily for 2 days, if the lung condition worsened), and none of their 31 patients with SARS was intubated. We at first followed that treatment protocol but later excluded ribavirin owing to its ineffectiveness and potential for hemolysis [19] . As a result, only 50% of our study population received ribavirin. In our study population, a significantly higher proportion of the SARS group (12/14; 85.7%) compared to the control group received corticosteroid therapy (85.7% vs 38.9%; P = .004). Corticosteroids carry the risk of lowering or compromising patients' immunity, which will in turn increase their susceptibility to nosocomial infections. The effect of this factor may be even more critical because our patients were older, critically ill, mechanically ventilated, and had comorbidities. Moreover, all of our patients with SARS had leukocytosis and increased neutrophil count, and 9 (64.3%) died during the ICU stay. Among the deceased patients with SARS, 7 (78%) had concomitant bacterial and/ or fungal infections, and their peak WBC count occurred within 2 days before death ( Table 6 ). The above findings implied that corticosteroid use and concomitant bacterial/ fungal infections might contribute to leukocytosis and high mortality in critically ill patients with SARS. Also, Lee et al [7] had suggested that advanced age and high neutrophil count were independent predictors of poor outcomes among patients with SARS. Accordingly, it might be better to use corticosteroids more cautiously in the old, comorbid, and critically ill patients with SARS.",

Most (56%) of the deaths in our SARS group occurred in the third to fourth week after ICU admission. This was remarkably different from the deaths in our non-SARS group, which occurred mostly (80%) within 2 weeks after ICU admission (P = .004, Fig. 2 ). Old age, comorbidities, and concomitant infections might have been contributing factors. However, other factors might also have been responsible for the time-related discrepancies in mortality between these 2 groups. Peiris et al [6] had shown that there were 2 peaks of acute respiratory distress syndrome development in patients with SARS. The first peak occurred between 10 and 12 days and the second between 19 and 21 days after fever onset. Maybe this second peak of acute respiratory distress syndrome development in patients with SARS impaired their lung functions and partly contributed to the relatively late occurrence of high mortality in our patients with SARS. In addition, the cumulative mortality rate at 120 days after ICU admission was relatively higher in our patients with SARS than in our control patients (64% vs 42%). However, the difference is not statistically significant (P = .21).",
