The human population currently lacks immunity to COVID-19, a viral zoonotic disease with a case fatality rate (CFR) of the order of 1%. This means that without controls there is likely to be widespread infection, which may overwhelm health care systems and lead to large numbers of deaths. In this study we examined potential control scenarios generated by a standard mathematical modelling approach to epidemic spread to consider the impacts on the progression of the disease in New Zealand. Our model is parameterised for the spread of COVID-19 through the New Zealand population (Wilson, 2020) with intervention strategies calibrated from a recent study of COVID-19 spread through the US and UK (Fergusson, 2020). Using the model we examine a range of possible interventions and their effect on the healthcare system and population fatality rate.",

These hospitalisation and ICU rates are substantially lower than estimates from CDC (2020) (see Table 1 ). However the latter could be biased by low detection rates in the US. In 2001, New Zealand had approximately 6 ICU beds per 100,000 people (Ministry of Health, 2005) . We used a higher number of 10 ICU beds per 100,000 people here, to allow for conversion of other hospital facilities, for example from cancelling elective surgery, to temporary ICU beds. This gives a total of 500 ICU beds and so ICU capacity is reached when the total number of current infections reaches 40,000 (equivalent I = 0.8% of the population). We also investigated the consequences of having higher/lower ICU capacity.",

Both types of strategy were modelled by reduction in the transmission coefficient, resulting in a proportional reduction in the reproduction number with control (Rc). This is a very simple control model which assumes that transmission rates from pre-symptomatic, unconfirmed symptomatic and confirmed symptomatic infections are all reduced by a constant factor. This describes society-wide control interventions, such as social distancing, hygiene measures, and lockdowns. It does not account for control measures that specifically target confirmed cases, such as case isolation. These could be modelled by a larger reduction in transmission rates for confirmed cases; we did not attempt this but it could be included in future model refinements to investigate the dependence of control efficacy on testing. The magnitude of the reduction in Rc was calibrated by comparisons with international data on case trajectories ( Fig. 2 ) and modelling studies for the UK and US outbreaks (Ferguson et al 2020) . The latter study assumed that interventions would have a similar impacts as they do with seasonal influenza. We then simulated suppression strategies by a fixed reduction in Rc for a period of 400 days. We simulated mitigation strategies by dynamic changes in Rc aimed at keeping the demand on the healthcare system under capacity (i.e. current infections under 40,000). In all cases, control began at t = 42 days after exposure of the initial seed infections. Table 1 . Estimates for the hospitalisation rate, ICU admission rate and case fatality rate (CFR) for New Zealand. These were calculated from the age-specific rates published by CDC (2020) combined with the age structure of New Zealand's population (StatsNZ). These values assume that NZ has a similar healthcare system, rates of underlying health conditions, and Covid-19 testing rates as the US. Note that our model uses lower values than these estimates, which is reasonable because the model parameters represent rates per infection, which will be lower than rates per confirmed case if some infections are asymptomatic, subclinical or otherwise undiagnosed.

Mitigation strategies were simulated as a combination of a low level of control (case isolation and household quarantine, reducing Rc to 1.75) with periods of high control as required to try and keep the number of cases under hospital capacity. There are various ways this could be achieved. One approach is a \"switching\" strategy ( Fig. 4) in which strong controls are imposed when hospital capacity is close to full (shaded blue areas in Fig. 4) and relaxed when there is spare hospital capacity available. The scenario shown in Fig. 4 requires the strong control periods to reduce Rc below 1 (Rc = 0.75 during periods in strong control in Fig. 4 ). Strong control is initiated when the number of ICU cases reaches capacity, and is lifted when the number of ICU cases drops to 50% of capacity. This is comparable to the scenario tested by Ferguson et al (2020) , where weak control means Rc=1.75 (representing case isolation and household quarantine in the Ferguson et al (2020) model) and strong control means Rc=0.75 (representing the above measures plus populationwide social distancing in Ferguson et al (2020)). Periods of alternating strong/weak control are required to continue for approximately 750 days to prevent hospital capacity from being exceeded.",

In general mitigation requires an initial period of weak control to allow the epidemic to establish, then an extended period (3-4 months) of very strong control. This can be followed by periods when control measures can be loosened, but strong control needs to be re-established when cases increase towards hospital capacity. One way to approach this is alternating periods of strong control (shaded blue, Rc=0.75) and weak control (unshaded, Rc =1.75) as shown in the graphs. Fig. 4 to succeed requires control measures sufficiently strong to force Rc below 1. It remains completely unknown whether a scenario such as that shown in Fig. 4 is achievable in practice in New Zealand or any comparable country. Fig. 2 shows that the only countries that have so far succeeded in getting the effective reproduction number less than 1 are China and South Korea. In those countries, this has been achieved by extremely intensive measures, including mandatory and strictly enforced quarantine, huge amounts of resources devoted to contact tracing, electronic surveillance of citizens' movements, etc. In other countries, including those that have instigating major lockdowns such as Italy, there is as yet insufficient evidence that this has reduced Rc to 1 (Fig. 2) .",

The outcome can be improved slightly by triggering strong control earlier (Fig.  5b , strong control initiated when ICU cases reach 50% of capacity). If strong control only reduces Rc to 1.5 (Fig. 5c) , even with the earlier trigger, the mitigation strategy fails as hospital capacity is substantially exceeded and the population mortality increases to 1.0% (almost double that for Fig. 4) .",

In reality, there is a time lag between infections becoming symptomatic (compartment Iu) and become severe enough to require ICU admission. To better reflect this, we assumed that no unconfirmed cases are in ICU and a fixed proportion of confirmed cases are in ICU. The proportion of confirmed cases in ICU was set at a level that gives the same overall proportion of ICU cases in the long run. The main consequence of this change to the model is that there is longer time lag before the strong control measures start to reduce the number of new infections, which means that cases overshoot hospital capacity (Fig. 6a) . If strong control is sufficiently effective (Rc=0.75), this problem can be offset by triggering strong earlier, when ICU reaches 50% of capacity rather than 100% of capacity (Fig. 6b) . As before, if strong control is less effective than hoped for (only reducing Rc to 1.5),the mitigation strategy fails as hospital capacity is completely overwhelmed and the mortality rate doubles (Fig. 6c ).",

However, model results show that for these to be successful requires the ability to reduce transmission to a level where the effective reproduction number Rc is close to or below 1. It remains unknown whether this will be achievable in practice in New Zealand. There is no evidence that it has yet been achieved in comparable, western democracies, including those that have instigated major lockdowns such as Italy. The only regimes that have conclusively achieved this level of control are China and South Korea. In these countries, this has been achieved by extremely intensive measures, including mandatory and strictly enforced quarantine, huge amounts of resources devoted to contact tracing, electronic surveillance of citizens' movements, etc. In addition, successful mitigation requires periods of these intensive control measures to be continued for up to 2.5 years before the population acquires a sufficient level of herd immunity. This could be an underestimate as these models do not include population turnover via birth-death, which will become significant over this time frame and may act to reduce the build-up of herd immunity. Furthermore, correct timing of strong control measures is crucial to successfully keeping healthcare systems from being overloaded. Small uncertainties in case trajectories could lead to drastically overshooting hospital and ICU capacity. If hospitalisation and/or ICU admission rates are in reality higher than assumed here, e.g. closer to the CDC (2020) estimates (Table 1) , then mitigation strategies aimed at keeping ICU load under become even more difficult. Expanding New Zealand's ICU capacity would alleviate this somewhat, and would be a sensible precaution in any case.",

This approach is similar in principle to the on-off strategy shown in Fig. 4 , but with the crucial difference that it aims to keep cases close to zero (as opposed to merely under ICU capacity).
