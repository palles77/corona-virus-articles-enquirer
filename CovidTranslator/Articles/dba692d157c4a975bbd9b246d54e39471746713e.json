            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly infectious disease of swine. It causes severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and death in suckling and nursing piglets that are typically 1-2 weeks of age [1, 2] . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family [3, 4] . The virus strain was first isolated in Belgium in 1973 and designated coronavirus CV777 [1] . There were only a few reports in the following decades [5] [6] [7] . However, a new PEDV strain has emerged in Asia since 2010 [7] [8] [9] [10] . In China, the positive rate of PEDV in some provinces was over 50% in 2010-2011 [7] . In USA, classical PEDV first identified in the state of Ohio in 2013, and a variant PEDV was reported in 2014 [11] . In Japan, more than 490,000 pigs died of PED from 2013 to 2015 [12] . In Korea, PED outbreaks reoccurred in 2013 [13, 14] . In Europe, isolates were reported from the Ukraine, Belgium, Holland, France, Germany, Portugal and Italy from 2013 to 2015 [15] . These isolates were closely related to those strains reported from North America [11, 15] .",

For ORF1a/1b gene, these strains are most similar to these strains, LZW, SHQPYM2013, AJ1102, CH/YNKM-8/2013, CH/JX-1/ 2013, USAKansas1252014, and CHZMDZY11, respectively. For S gene, these strains are most similar to these strains LZW, KoreaK14JB01, USAIllinois972013, USA-Kansas1252014, and CH/GDZQ/2014, respectively. The percentage of nucleotide identities of S of PEDV strains in this study compared with recombined strains SeCoV is 90.4-90.7%. For M gene, these strains are most similar to these strains USAIllinois972013 and USAKansas1252014. (Table 3) .

The strains in this study are indicated by underline Isolation and recombinant analysis of variants of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains from\u2026 297 Frequent mutation and recombination of genes may occur in epidemics of PEDV. In order to detect these possible recombination events, 19 reference strains were used as parent strains for RDP, GENECONV, Chimaera, MaxChi, BootScan, SiScan, and 3Seq program analysis. The results showed that PEDV in this study were possibly recombinant strain formed by parent strains USAIlli-nois972013, KoreaK14JB01, CHYJ130330 and CHZMDZY11 (Fig. 3) . USAIllinois972013 is major parent of PEDV strain CH/BJ9/2015, the recombination region locates on 4669-8176nt; KoreaK14JB01 is minor parent of PEDV strains CH/BJ2/2016 and CH/BJ11/2016, the recombination region locates on 21744-27721nt; CHYJ130330 is major parent of PEDV strain CH/HB9/ 2016 and CHZMDZY11 is minor parent of CH/HB9/2016, their recombination region locates on 2218-15942nt. However, there may be a deviation in the prediction of software. It requires further confirms these recombination events.",

In this study, the deceased piglets that provided intestine samples had been immunized with the CV777 vaccine previously. This showed that the classic vaccine strain exhibited lower protective efficacy against the variant PEDV [22, 23] . The phylogenetic trees showed that, these PEDV isolates from the Beijing area belonged to group II, while the traditional vaccine strain, CV777, belonged to group I based on the comparison of several important genes in PEDV, such as ORF1a/1b, S, M, N, E, and ORF3. However, N, as a conserved gene, was inconsistent with the above results, which also suggested that the N sequence or protein is suitable for universal detection. The ORF1a/1b gene were two long ORFs which encoding the non-structural replicase polyproteins of PEDV. The strain from 2015 in the Beijing area shared the greatest homology in ORF1a/1b with LZW, which was also isolated in Beijing; it showed the continuity of heredity. The S sequence of isolates in 2015 in the Beijing area showed a closer relationship with a previous isolate, LZW. Other isolates in 2016 in the Beijing area showed a closer relationship with previous isolates in Guangdong. This revealed that S genes accumulated variations faster based on inherent genetic characteristics or recombinant genes from other isolates [10, 20, 24] .",

This determined the genetic correlation between these strains in the Beijing area and the CV777 strain. It was remarkable that E sequences of isolates in the Beijing area had distinct differences from other isolates. There were unique variations in the E gene in these strains, such as T27G.
