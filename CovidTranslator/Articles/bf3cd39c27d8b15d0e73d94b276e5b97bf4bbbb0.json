            "text": "Searching for a mechanism underlying autoimmunity in autism, we postulated that gliadin peptides, heat shock protein 60 (HSP-60), and streptokinase (SK) bind to different peptidases resulting in autoantibody production against these components. We assessed this hypothesis in patients with autism and in those with mixed connective tissue diseases. Associated with antigliadin and anti-HSP antibodies, children with autism and patients with autoimmune disease developed anti-dipeptidylpeptidase I (DPP I), anti-dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV [or CD26]) and anti-aminopeptidase N (CD13) autoantibodies. A significant percentage of autoimmune and autistic sera were associated with elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, or IgA antibodies against three peptidases, gliadin, and HSP-60. These antibodies are specific, since immune absorption demonstrated that only specific antigens (e.g., DPP IV absorption of anti-DPP IV), significantly reduced IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody levels. For direct demonstration of SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptide binding to DPP IV, microtiter wells coated with DPP IV were reacted with SK, HSP-60, and gliadin. They were then reacted with anti-DPP IV or anti-SK, anti-HSP, and antigliadin antibodies. Adding SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptides to DPP IV resulted in 27 to 43% inhibition of the DPP IV-anti-DPP IV reaction, but DPP IV-positive peptides caused 18 to 20% enhancement of antigen-antibody reactions. We propose that (i) superantigens (e.g., SK and HSP-60) and dietary proteins (e.g., gliadin peptides) in individuals with predisposing HLA molecules bind to aminopeptidases and (ii) they induce autoantibodies to peptides and tissue antigens. Dysfunctional membrane peptidases and autoantibody production may result in neuroimmune dysregulation and autoimmunity.",

In addition, a shift occurs from T helper 1 to T helper 2 T cells in autism as evidenced by a decrease in the production of inteleukin-2 (IL-2) and gamma interferon, but there is an increase in the production of IL-4 (20) .

DPP IV is a receptor for streptokinase (SK) on rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts via the LTSRPA amino acid sequence (18) . Binding of SK, the bacterial protein, to DPP IV resulted in the appearance of anti-SK and anti-DPP IV autoantibodies in patients with myocardial infarction treated with SK (8, 19) . Based on these observations and the potent immunogenicity of SK in patients with autoimmune disease, SK could bind to DPP IV and induce significant levels of anti-SK and anti-DPP IV antibody production. We have recently detected antibodies to nine different, neuron-specific antigens in sera of autistic children. These antibodies bound to different encephalitogenic molecules (i.e., milk butyrophilin, Chlamydia pneumoniae and streptococcus M protein, as well as neurological antigens) (51) . Chlamydia, streptococci, and many other infectious agents produce molecules called superantigens or heat shock proteins (HSPs), which can modulate host immune functions. Bacterial superantigens can transactivate the endogenous superantigens by stressful stimuli, including exposure to oxidative radicals, heavy metals, anoxia, and infection (28, 35, 60, 64) . Induction of endogenous superantigens by infections might exert a profound impact on the immune response and nudge it into an autoimmune condition (16, 47) .",

The main objective of our data analysis was to examine the differences between the levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies among four groups (children with no conditions, adults with no conditions, children with autism, and adult patients with autoimmune disease) against anti-DPP IV autoantibody levels, anti-DPP I antibody levels, anti-aminopeptidase N (CD13) autoantibody levels, and antigliadin and HSP-60 peptide autoantibody levels. IgG, IgM, and IgA are considered three dependent variables, with one factor variable that divides our sample into the four groups mentioned above. The general linear model (GLM) for Windows 11.5 with advanced option (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill.) was used in this study. Using Hotelling's trace, the exact F statistics are provided. In addition, for the post hoc tests the Scheff\u00e9 significant difference tests were performed. The GLM multivariate procedure provides analysis of variance for multiple dependent variables by one or more factor variables. The factor variables divide the population into various groupings of a joint distribution of dependent variables.",

Based on these findings and earlier reports about the elevation of anti-DPP IV and anti-SK antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (7) , and patients with myocardial infarction (8), we first examined the existence of DPP IV autoantibodies in blood samples of children with autism and compared them to levels in patients with mixed connective tissue disease ( Fig. 1 and Table 3 ). Second, we asked whether or not antibodies to other peptidases, such as DPP I and CD13, are detected in the sera of patients with autoimmune disease and in children with autism. To our surprise, we found almost similar levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to DPP I and CD13 in patients with mixed connective tissue disease and autism, but not in controls ( Fig. 2 and 3) .",

The answer, depicted in Fig. 6 and 7, is that between 50 and 100% of patients with autism and autoimmune disease who had elevated DPP IV, DPP I, and CD13 antibodies also had antigliadin and anti-HSP-60 antibodies. Since in inhibition studies (Table 4 ) gliadin and HSP were not capable of reducing the levels of DPP IV antibodies (meaning there is no antigenic similarity between gliadin, HSP, and DPP IV) similar to SK binding to DPP IV (44, 45) , we postulated that gliadin and HSP-60 peptides binding to aminopeptidase is responsible for antigliadin, anti-HSP, and anti-DPP IV, anti-DPP I, and anti-CD13 autoantibody production. Further analysis of results showed that while 26, 25, and 41% of autoimmune sera had simultaneous elevation of IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to all tested antigens, the autistic sera had 24, 30, and 74% elevations in antibodies to DPP IV, DPP I, CD13, gliadin, and HSP-60. This high level of IgA production in 36 of 50 (72%) of children with autism against three peptidases, gliadin, and HSP peptide is further indication of reaction between these molecules and tissue peptidases. Indeed, when the Scheff\u00e9 significant difference test was employed for the four groups, overall the autism and autoimmune groups were very similar for the levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies, but they were significantly different from the control (Table 2) . These results are only supportive but not strong evidence for the binding of gliadin and HSP peptides to aminopeptidases. This similarity in antibody response to membrane peptidases, SK, HSPs, and gliadin peptides in children with autism and patients with autoimmune disease is further evidence of suggested autoimmunity in autism.",

In addition, introduction of rabbit anti-SK, antigliadin, or anti-HSP antibody to the plates coated with DPP IV first and then SK, gliadin, or HSP resulted in enhancement of ODs above background by 18 to 27%. These results further support the binding of SK, gliadin, or HSP to DPP IV in vitro and possibly in vivo (Table 5) .

This contradictory effect on the immune system was explained by a bimodal action of DPP IV in immune function (25) . Finally, by virtue of this exopeptidase activity, we should not forget that DPP IV plays a key regulatory role in the metabolism of peptides. Thus inactivation of peptidases by autoantibodies may result in accumulation of dietary peptides such as gluteomorphins and casomorphins, in the gut and in circulation, resulting in possible neuroimmune dysregulation. The molecular mimicry between these peptides and human tissue antigens such as myosin (9) and cerebellar antigens (5, 13, 21) may result in sensitization of cross-reactive T cells that could mediate the demyelinating process. The activated T cells may then stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies directed against nerve cell components or recruit macrophages as effector cells (24) . A combination of humoral and cellular factors including cytokines may therefore participate in the cause of the disease.",

At a cutoff value of 0.29, OD levels of IgG antibody were calculated in controls and patients' sera; the results show that while 5 of 50 (10%) control children and 7 of 50 (14%) control adults had high IgG values, the patients' group showed IgG elevation in FIG. 1.

For example, means for IgG (DPP I) for the control children and control adult groups are 0.1446 and 0.1492, respectively, which are statistically alike. Similarly, the means for the autism (0.3580) and autoimmune (0.3940) groups are statistically the same. However, the means for control children are significantly different from the autism or autoimmune group. Similarly, the means for the control adults are statistically different from both the autism and autoimmune groups. Also note that the control groups (0.1492 and 0.1480) are similar for IgM (DPP I), but autism (0.2980) and autoimmune (0.4300) results are not statistically alike. Potentially, up to four subsets could be formed, simply because for each dependent variable we have four experimental groups. When this is the case, each mean's group should be reported in a separate subset. However, if all four means are statistically alike, all should be reported in one subset.
