Due to increased human population and accelerated global travel, local outbreaks become instant global threats. Despite technological advances in medicine, devastating communicable diseases such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or avian influenza continue to surface and ravage humankind. The 1918 influenza outbreak killed at least 20 million people in about 24 weeks, but HIV/AIDS has killed more than 25 million since 1981 and continues its march around the globe. Researchers are concerned that an avian influenza outbreak could kill many more people when it emerges because of the absence of immunity and human travel interaction patterns.",

Even when a disease occurs in different locations, the rate of occurrence frequently varies between places. Some areas have high rates of a particular disease than others or may not have that disease at all. Generally, tropical regions with warm, humid climates tend to facilitate the proliferation of disease causing organisms, or insects and animals that carry such disease. Similarly, physical environmental characteristics, such as soil type and the mineral content of soils and rock, which vary from one location to another, may also inhibit or encourage disease. Swampy vegetation in lowlying areas of the tropics is ideal for the proliferation of mosquitoes and thus, endemic malaria. Finally, cultural practices, including diet, behavior, and occupation, also contribute to geographic variations in health and disease.",

            "text": "The disease ecology model attributes spatial variations in disease to three major variables -environment, genetics and behavior. Environment is a broad context and includes not just the physical environment of livelihood, environmental pollution e.g. (including indoor pollution such as radon) and water quality, but also the socioeconomic environment, including relative deprivation, healthcare quality and access, land mines, and the political economic context. For example, unlike Canada, where universal access to care based on need is provided for all citizens, in the United States, access to care depends on ability to pay. Thus, immunization is more easily available in Canada than in the US and this influences the infant mortality rate and life expectancy in the two countries. Genetic predisposition is important particularly for degenerative diseases. People with light skin pigmentation are more prone to skin cancer than others with a darker pigmentation. Similarly, recent research suggests that Ashkenazi Jewish women have a higher risk of breast cancer compared to other women. The human genome project is not only identifying genes responsible for several serious diseases such as Parkinson but also developing exciting new and effective therapies for them. Human behavior is the final component in the disease ecology model. Put simply, behavior facilitates or inhibits disease. Unhealthy behavior traits such as excessive alcohol consumption, overeating and failure to exercise, unsafe sexual practices and smoking are associated with various diseases. In contrast, regular exercise and other positive health behaviors, including proper diet, enhance health and prevent disease. Thus, spatial variations in Africa's environment, including widespread poverty that promotes extra-marital and transactional sex, poor healthcare environment with limited access to antiretrovirals, cultural practices such as circumcision, widow inheritance, and preference for unsafe sexual practices, combine with other factors to make HIV/AIDS rates the highest in the world. Similarly, variations exist between and within countries. Besides vertical transmission (from mother to child), genetics is not as important in HIV transmission -all humans are genetically susceptible.",

Traditionally, immigrants have always provided a vital link in disease transmission between their home regions and their destination. By establishing close contact between distant places, immigrant travels promote disease spread. For example, European travelers carried diseases that killed many people in the Americas. However, recent developments in technology and travel have escalated the role of travel-related disease spread. In fact, the volume, speed, and reach of travel today have so accelerated the spread of communicable diseases that national boundaries no longer offer isolation or protection. The brief review that follows demonstrates that permanent migrants are not the only means of disease spread. Shortterm visitors, including tourists, are also very important in the spatial diffusion of microbes and pathogens.",

The incubation takes between 3 and 30 days, but a person begins to shed the virus in their stool 7-10 days before, and 3-6 weeks after the onset of symptoms. A small minority of cases (0.5-1%) of cases result in paralysis, and while polio can affect people at any age, at least 50% of cases occur in children 3-5 years old.

Despite massive efforts, total eradication continues to be an elusive goal. The global campaign to eradicate polio by 2005 suffered a severe setback when parts of northern Nigeria rejected the polio vaccine because Muslim clerics claimed that the vaccine causes infertility and spreads HIV/AIDS and cancer. From those few states, polio spread through large parts of the country, neighboring countries, and eventually to Saudi Arabia through Nigerian Muslims on pilgrimage to Mecca. Indonesian Muslims, who were exposed during their pilgrimage in Mecca, carried the disease with them to Indonesia where it became reestablished.

According to the CDC, persons who engaged in sexual activity abroad first introduced these strains of QRNG in the US, but now incidence is no longer related to travel. Whereas less than 1% QRNG isolates were identified between 1999 and 2001, 9.4% were reported in 2005, and in people with no history of travel.

One particularly fascinating recent development is mapping genotypes of communicable disease. Each disease causing organism has a specific phenotype, and the species members have a more unique genotype. Tools exist for separating and categorizing disease organisms with these more unique genotypes into groups based on their genetic structure (isolates). Two people with identical or matching isolates indicate recent transmission from a common source; unique isolates indicate remote transmission from a different source. Analyzing and mapping these genotypes allows researchers to distinguish between not just disease species (phenotype) but also locate areas with high incidence and different strains of the disease, including recent versus remote transmission of disease. Areas with high rates of clustered genotypes indicate ongoing transmission (i.e., an outbreak), whereas multiple unique isolates indicate infections that were acquired elsewhere (are imported).",

During the 28-month intervention, the number of cases of tuberculosis decreased from 28.5 cases per 1000 screenings to 2.4 cases per 1000. The rate of developing latent tuberculosis infection fell from 14.3 to 2.2 per 100 person-years of exposure. The intervention was successful because it distinguished between high incidence areas with high and low levels of clustered strains, and deployed resources not just on the basis of incidence but on the basis of genotype.
