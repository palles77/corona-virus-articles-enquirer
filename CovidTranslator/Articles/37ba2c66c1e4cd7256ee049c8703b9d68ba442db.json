Three further pigs (group 2) received PRRSV alone, two (group 3) received PRV alone, and two (group 4) remained as uninfected controls. Despite the admittedly small numbers of animals, the experiment appeared to throw light on aspects of synergy. Thus, the group 1 pigs showed severe neurological signs characterized by ataxia and muscular tremors. Total cell numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were increased in all PRRSVinfected pigs, and PRRSV antigen was detected in the alveolar macrophages. Total cell numbers in the cerebrospinal fluid of group 1 pigs were considerably greater than those demonstrated in group 3, but no PRV antigen was found. Pigs of groups 1 and 2 showed pulmonary lesions, characterized by interstitial pneumonia and PRRSV antigen immunolabelling. Non-suppurative encephalitis was found in five of the six pigs of groups 1 and 3. In particular, one group 1 animal had severe necrotizing encephalitis with intranuclear inclusion bodies and associated immunolabelling of PRV antigen. The other three group 1 pigs had prominent malacic lesions, with macrophages. These neuropathological findings strongly suggested that PRRSV infection in pigs enhances the severity of brain lesions caused PRV. q",

(2003) , suggested that PRRSV infection in pigs affects the replication of PRV. Each of the infectious agents produces characteristic lesions at the various sites of viral replication (Narita et al., 1985 (Narita et al., , 1991 (Narita et al., , 1993 Rossow, 1998) . In the present experiment, seven pigs infected with PRRSV (groups 1 and 2) had slight interstitial pneumonia but no necrotizing bronchiolitis. These pneumonic lesions were closely associated with the presence of PRRSV antigen, and were probably due to PRRSV infection since they resembled PRRSVassociated lesions described in previous reports (Rossow, 1998; Shibata et al., 2003) . Five of six pigs infected with PRV (groups 1 and 3) had non-suppurative encephalitis and trigeminal ganglioneuritis. One dually infected pig (no. 1) had severe necrotizing encephalitis with intranuclear inclusion bodies, while the other three (nos 2-4) had prominent encephalomalacia, with macrophages. All dually infected pigs had tonsillitis with inclusion bodies and severe atrophy of the thymus. These results strongly suggest that PRRSV infection in pigs can increase the severity of brain and tonsillar lesions due to PRV replication, and also the severity of lung lesions (Shibata et al., 2003) . Moreover, thymic atrophy may be related to dual infection.",

            "text": "The total number of CSF cells increased 4-to 8fold in PRV-infected pigs as compared with the numbers in pigs infected with PRRSV alone and in the non-infected pigs. Moreover, the total number was higher in dually infected pigs that in those infected with PRV alone. In PRV-infected pigs, neither PRV nor PRRSV antigen was detected in CSF cells. The total cell number in the BALF increased by up to 4-fold in all PRRSV-infected pigs, and PRRSV (but not PRV) antigen was detected in the alveolar macrophages. These results corresponded well with the presence of interstitial pneumonia. Thus, the results of CSF cell analysis accorded with the severity of the brain lesions in the dually infected pigs, and the results of BALF cell analysis with the interstitial pneumonic lesions in PRRSV-infected pigs. Herpes viruses spread via sensory axons and infect sensory neurons in the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system (Cook and Stevens, 1973; Narita et al., 1991 Narita et al., , 2001 Chowdhury et al., 1997; Yanai et al., 2003) . In PRV infection in pigs, infection spreads from the nasal cavity via the olfactory pathway to produce non-suppurative encephalitis (Narita et al., 1985 (Narita et al., , 1991 (Narita et al., , 1992 (Narita et al., , 1993 (Narita et al., , 1997 . In the present experiments, one dually infected pig had severe encephalitis and three had encephalomalacia, characterized by neuronal degeneration with intranuclear inclusion bodies, a diffuse or focal glial reaction, and perivascular cuffing, as well as by cavitation accompanied by large numbers of macrophages. The lesions were mainly confined to the olfactory bulb and rhinencephalon, including the olfactory tract, olfactory stria, and pyriform cortex. The encephalomalacic lesions may therefore have developed from necrotic foci similar to those observed in PRV-infected newborn piglets (Nunoya et al., 1985) and in animals with fluctuating temperatures (Narita et al., 1991) . Thus, the neuropathological findings strongly suggested that PRRSV infection in pigs enhanced the severity of brain lesions caused by PRV. This apparent synergy was supported by histopathological findings.",
