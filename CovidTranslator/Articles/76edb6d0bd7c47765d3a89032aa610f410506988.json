Concerns on the negative effects of urbanization on the environment recently make the topic increasingly important for urban planners and architects (Ng, 2009; Bottema, 1995) . Tall and compact building blocks seriously worsens the natural ventilation performance at the metropolitan areas, even though there is a large wind potential in the urban atmosphere boundary layer, such as Hong Kong which is a high-density coastal city. The natural ventilation is an important contributing factor to outdoor thermal comfort, especially in subtropical cities. Cheng et al. (2012) indicated that, taking the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) thermal comfort as a standard, wind speed decreasing from 1.0 to 0.3 m/s is equal to 1.9\u00b0C air temperature increase in the subtropical summer. Good planning and design which include the wind knowledge can mitigate negative effects of urbanization, particularly urban heat island intensity (Oke, 1987) . Furthermore, these planning and design make compact urban living environments more comfortable for residents and consequently aid in the restriction of uncontrolled urban spreading (European Environment Agency, 2006; Garreau, 1992) .",

To mitigate the undesirable effects of the proposed buildings on the surrounding natural ventilation performance, four steps for knowledge-based decision making are significantly important in the design process. The first step is the analysis and simplification of local wind availability. Local wind availability is important for initial wind assessment at the urban scale. Furthermore, local wind data is necessary for the settings of the boundary condition for wind environment modeling at the city and building scales. The second step involves the modeling of the surrounding pedestrian airflow. The modeling results make detailed wind data available to all of wind engineers, urban planners, and architects for better understandings. The third step is the wind data collection. Both unbiased descriptions of the surrounding wind environment and critical windrelated design issue identification depend on an appropriate data collection process. Based on the robust application of the above three steps, the fourth step, the data interpretation can be confidently conducted. This step is critical in the decision-making process for building design implementation. A sufficient statistical analysis is necessary to summarize the collected wind data and correlate the modeling results with architectural design strategies. Then, knowledge-based decisions can be made by architects and urban planners.",

Compared with the modeling in the research work, the input conditions and proposed building morphologies are much more complicated in the real application. Requirements of architects in the data analysis are also very different with wind engineers and researchers. Thus, the current study focuses on the practical application of CFD simulation and aims to answer the questions that are often encountered by practicing wind consultants, architects, and planners: (1) how to set the appropriate boundary conditions, (2) how to verify the CFD simulation results in practical applications, and (3) how to collect and evaluate the simulation results to efficiently and accurately identify the important wind-related design issue for implementation. A procedural framework and methodologies for the practical application of CFD simulations in real architectural design process are provided in this study to make the CFD simulation more practical and dependable, as well as to make the results more helpful in architectural design. A case study in Hong Kong is conducted to illustrate how the proposed framework and methodologies can be used.",

Although the effect of the pressure drag of each building dominates the turbulent flow in the street canyon, the effects of pressure drag can be normalized or aggregated as the skin friction drag (shear stress) that results from the friction between large urban surfaces and air flow. This knowledge is considered as the quasiphysical reasoning that Prandtl's boundary layer theory presented in 1904 (Anderson, 2005) , the logarithmic wind profile, is valid for the airflow structure above the large urban area (Oke, 1987) . It is valid from z min to z max (the range of the thin shear layer), z min ) z 0 (surface roughness length), and z max ( d (boundary layer height) (Bottema, 1996) . Bottema (1996) stated that the vertical velocity gradient is the roughness constant in the Roughness Sub Layer (RSL), except several inhomogeneous horizontal flow (Arnfield, 2003) . Above z r (the blending height), at the top of the RSL, turbulence mixing becomes sufficient to ''blend'' the flow independent of the horizontal position (Garratt, 1978) . Notably, the height of z r depends on the urban density [1.5 z H (averaged building height) for high-density areas; 4 z H for low-density areas] (Oke, 2004) . From z r to d, the inhomogeneous building geometry length scales can be spatially-averaged by z 0 [similar to j 0 (K\u00e1rm\u00e1n constant) in the wall function of CFD], and the wind speed gradient in this layer can be estimated by z 0 and z d (displacement height) using the logarithmic equation.",

Several models are only valid for low-density areas (Counihan, 1971; Kutzbach, 1961; Lettau, 1969; Raupach, 1992) : ku d and ku 0 : k p 6 0.29; Le 0 : k f 6 02$0.3; Co 0 : k p 6 0.5; Ra 0 : k f 6 0.25.

The domain of regional-scale simulation covered 480 km \u00c2 480 km \u00c2 5 km. The uniform horizontal grid size was 8 km \u00c2 8 km, and the vertical grid space was enlarged from 4 m above the ground by using a total of 20 vertical layers. The simulation at the local scale can be performed in the high resolution because of the super computational capability of the Earth simulator. Ashie et al. (2009) used the standard j-e turbulence model with integration of the buoyancy of vapor and Coriolis force to simulate Tokyo's heat island phenomenon in very high resolution (5 m square horizontal and 1 m -10 m vertical intervals in a 3 km \u00c2 3 km \u00c2 500 m domain: approximately 5 \u00c2 10 9 grid points).

First, apart from the setting issues clearly stated in the current guidelines (Frank, 2006; Tominaga et al., 2008) , several important issues, such as grid dependence and convergence criteria, remain unclear. On one hand, because of the sophisticated real building morphologies, the quality of the mesh structure in real cases is not as good as that in parametric study, in which only simplified morphologies are used. Therefore, following the strict requirements for convergence criteria in real cases is more difficult than in parametric studies. COST 14 states that a reduction in scaled residuals of at least four orders of magnitude is required (Frank, 2006) . A practical criterion of iterative convergence is needed for real case studies. On the other hand, given that real case conditions are always different, using a unified criterion for the grid dependence is also difficult.",

For architects and planners, the result visualization is the intuitive grasp of the target wind environment. However, the global visualization of the wind environment is insufficient for identifying the optimal design option and for quantitatively determining whether the adopted mitigation strategies are sufficient. Furthermore, to analyze the annual or seasonal wind environment, the data analysis in the practical application always needs to include the simulation results in several input wind directions, according to the annual or seasonal wind probability. Making robust decisions by observing numerous visualized simulation results together becomes difficult. Therefore, except for the visualized simulation results, the statistic analysis of the wind speed frequency and distribution are required to evaluate the global natural ventilation performance (Yuan and Ng, 2012) . On the other hand, the statistical integration of simulation results in different input wind directions is needed.

The wind polar is designed for seven inlet wind directions, and the lengths on the each direction represent the value of VR i,j in the different design options. Several important facts from the local analysis are as follows: a) As shown in Table 5 , the wind polar at test point 1 represents the wind environment at the adjacent street in different wind directions. The wind velocity ratio in design option 3 in the input wind directions NE, NEE, E, and EES is significantly higher than that in design options 1 and 2. This result cannot be reflected by the averaged global analysis, in which the performance of options 2 and 3 are similar. b) As shown in Table 5 , the wind polar at test point 31 compares the efficiency of the different design option strategies in terms of natural ventilation performance at the outdoor space in the secondary school. The wind velocity ratios in the input wind directions E, EES, ES, and ESS indicate that, among the three design options, the air can flow earliest through the proposed building in design option 3. Based on the above global and local analyses, the performances of options 2 and 3 are found to be globally better than that of option 1. At the location with strategic importance, design option 3 outperforms option 2. c) Even after identifying the optimal design option, a more detailed understanding can be obtained to improve the optimal design option further. The wind velocity ratio polar in Table 6 indicates that the natural ventilation performance at test point 24 in design option 3 can be significantly poorer than that in design option 1. As shown in Fig. 10 , combining the wind polar and ground floor planning, the limitation can be identified to the part of the building in option 3 that is highlighted by in red.
