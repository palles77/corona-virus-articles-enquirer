For many geographic regions, there is limited epidemiological information on the main causative agents of these diseases. In this article, we investigated, in a prospective study, the viral agents leading to acute respiratory disease in children younger than 15 years of age who were admitted to the pediatric emergency unit of a major teaching hospital in Erbil City, capital of the Kurdistan region, Iraq. Nasopharyngeal samples obtained from 269 hospitalized children were analyzed for viral respiratory pathogens using the xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel Fast assay, and the data were correlated with the clinical and demographic information available for these patients. One or more respiratory virus(es) were detected in 203 out of 269 (75.5%) samples. The most frequent viruses were enterovirus/rhinovirus (n = 88; 32.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 55; 20.4%), and human metapneumovirus (n = 36; 13.4%). In 42 samples (15.6%), coinfections with 2 or more respiratory viruses were detected, with enterovirus/rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus being identified as the most common agents in viral coinfections in these patients.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first long-term prospective study performed to determine the involvement of 18 common respiratory viruses in ARIs among hospitalized children in Erbil, Kurdistan. In this study, the causative viruses, detection frequency, seasonality, and coinfection patterns of the most common respiratory viruses were investigated using the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel Fast v2 assay. Our results provided a distinctive epidemiological profile of viral respiratory infections in hospitalized children with ARIs in the study area.",

            "text": "Overall, nucleic acid of one (or more) respiratory virus(es) was detected in as many as 75.5% of the samples obtained from the study group of 269 patients with ARIs requiring treatment in a pediatric emergency unit. These data are consistent with previous studies in which viral detection rates of 65% to 90% for at least one virus in respiratory tract samples collected from children under 15 years of age with ARIs were reported, although different test systems and molecular methods were used in those studies. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The most frequently detected viruses causing ARIs in patients of our study group were HEV/HRV and RSV, both as single-virus infections and viral coinfections, followed by infections with hMPV and hAdV. Frequently, RSV is defined as the predominant viral etiology in hospitalized children with ARIs. 2, 15 However, in our study members of the genus Enterovirus (HEV and HRV) was the most frequently detected virus groups. This result is in agreement with previous studies, which showed identification of Enterovirus genus in samples taken from children infected with ARIs. 13, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] Considering that the current study included only hospitalized children, this result highlighted the involvement and importance of Enterovirus genus members in the ARIs among children in study area. Also, age group, climate, geographic area, and others factors have an influence on the reported rate among different studies of each respiratory virus in hospitalized ARIs. [20] [21] [22] RSV was the second most frequently detected virus detected in our study group (20.4% ). This result is in good agreement with a previous Iraqi study conducted in Babylon City, which detected RSV in 24% of the samples from a study group of 50 children using a PCRbased assay. 23 Despite these slight differences in the detection rates for RSV, our result was in contrast to other studies indicating RSV as the dominate cause of respiratory infection in children. 8, 24, 25 In several recent studies, hMPV was one of the most frequently detected viruses involved in ARIs. 26, 27 Two previous studies investigated the role of hMPV infection in ARIs in Iraq using non-nucleic acid-based techniques. Al-Mola et al 28 reported a detection frequency that was similar to our result (13.3%) using a direct immunofluorescent assay for samples collected from infants of <2 years, while Aziz et al 29 The overall incidence of influenza A and B viruses (9.9%) was similar to studies conducted in Iran (5.5%), 33 Malaysia (11%), 34 and Turkey (12.6%), 12 respectively. The influenza A virus isolates detected in the study were exclusively 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. In our study, 6.3% of the samples were tested positive for hAdV, similar to numbers reported for Kuwait (7.7%), 31 higher than those reported for Iran (3.4%), 35 and lower than those reported for Gabon (17.5%). 36 The detection rate for PIV 1 was 4-fold higher than that of PIV 3 in our study (5.9% vs 1.5%), which differed from the report by He et al 37 in Shenzhen, China, but was similar to the data reported by Al-Ayed et al 13 for Saudi Arabia (4.6% and 0.9% for PIV 1 and PIV 3, respectively). Only very few of the patients in our study group (2.2%) were found to be infected with HBoV. He et al 37 During the study period, HCoVs were detected only in a single case, in which HCoV-NL63 could be identified, indicating a minor role of these viruses in causing severe forms of ARIs in the Erbil City population. This result was similar to a study conducted in Kuwait, which failed to detect any HCoV-NL63 infections in 735 hospitalized patients, while higher numbers were reported for other neighboring countries, such as Turkey (2.9%) and Saudi Arabia (3.7%). 12, 13, 31 The current study's single HCoV-NL63-positive patient was less than 8 months old, confirming that HCoV-NL63 is more frequently identified in ARIs in younger children. 38 Despite this low detection rate for HCoVs, the viruses appear to be circulating in this geographic region because a large proportion of serum samples taken from the study group was confirmed to be seropositive for HCoV-NL63 (69%) and HCoV-229E (65.5%) as determined by an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay-based assay using recombinant N protein as antigen (data not shown). It is tempting to speculate that common HCoVs (in contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and other respiratory viruses) cause less severe ARIs that only in very few cases require hospitalization. More studies (including virological studies of ARIs in pediatric outpatient departments) are required to explore this possibility.",

This is consistent with previous studies, showing a lowlevel circulation of respiratory viruses during the dry season. Seasonality of respiratory virus infections is known to vary due to temperature and humidity variations. 37, 41 The study area has 4 distinct seasons, with lowest temperatures usually occurring in January (average 8\u00b0C). From February to May, the average temperature varies between 12\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C with increasing rainfall. After April, the weather turns hot (average 40\u00b0C) and remains dry during the summer months. 42 In our study, the vast majority of ARI in children occurred between November and March, demonstrating a late autumn to early spring seasonality of viral respiratory infections in children in this geographic region.",

They confirm the major role of respiratory viruses in ARIs in hospitalized children in the study area, particularly in young infants younger than 5 years of age. HEV/ HRV, RSV, and hMPV were the most frequent pathogens, accounting for more than two thirds of the ARIs cases. Further studies including neighboring geographic regions, normalized and larger age groups, and extended sampling periods of several consecutive years are now being planned and will be used to establish a robust epidemiological database for respiratory virus infections in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.",
