Among 3545 terms or near term healthy babies who underwent cranial ultrasound examination in our hospital over a 2-year 5-month period, 18 were found to have FHCs (17 typical and one atypical; seven bilateral and 11 unilateral, of which seven were on the left and four on the right). The female to male ratio was 2:1. The incidence of FHCs in normal term babies was thus 0.5%. Six children had resolution of the cyst within 1 month, and 6 more had resolution on repeat scan from 2 to 11 months of age. Four children did not have subsequent ultrasonography to document resolution, but they had normal growth and development. Two were lost to follow up. The infant with an atypical FHC had an enlarged left frontal horn cyst with a midline shift on follow up, but he had normal development. Our study suggests that FHC may be a normal physiologic variant or a benign pathologic condition that can be expected to resolve spontaneously within a few months. It is reasonable to follow typical FHC by cranial ultrasound examinations at 1 or 2 and 6 months of age. In the case of an atypical cyst, more frequent follow up and further image studies like CT or MRI are necessary. q",

This suggests that FHC has little to do with prematurity and its associated stress. The benign outcome may be due to no important tract pass through the frontal horn area. Given these reports and, in our series, the similar elliptical, smooth, thin-walled appearance, their fixed location and similar incidence between prematurity and term baby, the absence of destruction of the surrounding brain tissue and absence of concomitant cranial ultrasound abnormalities, the normal perinatal history and subsequent development, we suspect that typical FHC may be a normal physiologic variant or a benign pathologic condition.",

And according to the Rademaker KJ et al., the frontal horn cyst is located at the external angle below the level of the lateral ventricles, whereas cysts occurring in periventricular leukomalacia extend above this level [6] . The only atypical cyst in our series did enlarge somewhat and had an initial mass effect, but the child's subsequent course was uneventful. More frequent follow up for an atypical FHC may be necessary, as the prognosis is not as clear as for typical cysts. Further, image studies like MRI or CT should be considered. While it may be a variant FHC, it may also belong to a different subset of intracranial cysts with a different prognosis.",
