Some people may produce food they don't consume people consume the food they produce. As well as providing nutrition and supporting livelihoods, a range of negative health impacts result from this. Among the most important health impacts of livestock are those resulting from infectious diseases: especially, zoonoses, emerging infectious diseases, foodborne disease and antimicrobial resistance. These categories overlap. There are complex linkages between agriculture and agriculture associated disease. Zoonoses are diseases transmissible between animals and people and may be endemic (continually present) or epidemic (occur in outbreaks). Many zoonoses have mainly been controlled in high income countries but are serious health issues in low and middle income countries. Many zoonoses are considered neglected diseases.",

On the other hand, animal agriculture and capture is especially problematic as a generator of disease risks and a contributor to overnutrition. Humans are animals and we share a majority of our diseases with them. Moreover, animal source food (ASF), while highly nutritious, provides a good medium for the survival and growth of pathogens. There are also many indirect linkages between animal agriculture and human health and nutrition. For example, because animal products are typically high value, they offer potential for income generation. At the same time, ready availability of markets may reduce the amount of nutritious animal source food available for household consumption. Animals require feeding, care and attention and this has implications for labour and time. In many cultures, women have an important role in animal husbandry and so this may directly compete with time available for child care. As well as contributing to diets and income, livestock produce many useful products and byproducts (such as manure, skins, fuel, power) and these products bring associated benefits and risks to health and well-being. For example, use of cow manure for fuel is widespread in India, which reduces costs of cooking but is associated with many diseases such as acute lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, and asthma (Chakraborty et al., 2014) .",

Examples are cysticercosis (pig tapeworm), brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, leptospirosis and food-borne zoonoses. They are common in poor populations and are responsible around a billion illnesses and millions of deaths every year (Grace et al., 2012b) .

They typically have high temporal and spatial variability. Their overall impact in terms of morbidity, mortality and production loss is much less than endemic zoonoses but because they can 'shock' systems they are often of high priority to farmers and decision makers. They can also cause important economic losses, which are often related to reaction to the disease rather than the disease itself.

            "text": "Zoonotic diseases, whether endemic or epidemic, are caused by a range of viral, bacterial, mycotic, chlamydial, rickettsial and parasitic pathogens. Many are directly transmitted (by aerosols or contact) from animals to people and vice versa, but a great number are transmitted between animals and humans via food (e.g. milk and meat) and other animal products, water and waste. The term 'zoonosis' does not indicate the direction of transmission, i.e. from vertebrate animals to humans or vice versa. Some zoonoses cause (severe) disease and/or mortality in both livestock and in humans (e.g. bovine tuberculosis and anthrax); others are inapparent, mild or chronic in livestock but may cause prolonged disease in humans (e.g. sleeping sickness due to Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and many food-/water-borne diseases such as campylobacteriosis). Yet others are important production or devastating diseases in livestock but are mild in humans (e.g. Newcastle disease) or are the cause of important disease burden mainly in immuno-compromised people (e.g. cryptosporidiosis, toxoplasmosis and giardiasis). Zoonoses have implications for food and nutrition security and sustainability beyond direct negative impacts caused by human sickness. Many zoonoses have negative impacts on animal health and productivity: these diseases directly reduce the availability and quality of animal source food. Zoonoses and their control also have complex upstream and downstream impacts on agri-food systems. For example, during the Rift Valley fever epidemic in east Africa in 2007, many actors beyond farmers (traders, processors, tea shop owners) suffered economic loss (Rich et al., 2011) . When people become ill from zoonoses their nutrition suffers, as does the nutrition of family members depending on them.",

A test and slaughter strategy in livestock can eliminate a zoonosis from a region, especially once prevalence has been lowered, e.g. after vaccination against brucellosis. There are preventive and curative drugs for treating animals (e.g. canine echinococcosis, porcine cysticercosis) or human (e.g. taeniasis).

Evidence on the economic benefits of control can stimulate this: one review on brucellosis, a common zoonosis, found that control invariably had more benefits than costs and that benefits from control in LMICs were relatively higher than in HICs (McDermott et al.) . Zoonoses with only livestock hosts are promising candidates for eradication. For example, cysticercosis, caused by the pig tapeworm or echinococcosis caused by the dog tapeworm.

Livestock may act as a secondary host which facilitates transmission to humans. Vectors, such as mosquitoes or midges, may also be involved. Many spillover events do not result in sustained disease transmission: the infection is not well adapted to the new host and burns out. However, in some cases, the disease establishes in a new host. Emerging zoonotic diseases have obvious implications for nutritional and food security. Widespread animal diseases reduce the availability of animal source food. But control of ZEIDs can also reduce animal source food available with likely nutritional consequences (Kavle et al., 2015) . If people become ill their health and nutrition are obviously affected.

Given the very different farming systems and regulatory environments, the approaches used successfully in Europe cannot be directly applied to developing countries. A number of food safety interventions have been tried and evaluated with little evidence for benefit or sustainability. Nonetheless, other initiatives show promise, and a smaller number have been able to demonstrate sustained and scalable benefits. For example, introduction of new technologies such as disinfectants or training of food handlers have been shown to lead to reduced pathogen loads in food and in some cases to reduced human infections. Important approaches to improving food safety include risk analysis and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP).
