This finding, and the fact that the two infections occurred independently of one another, underscore the need to enhance awareness of zoonotic poxvirus transmission (possibly endemic) also in regions where this problem has not been addressed so far, e.g. the Southern Alps. Almost all of the cases requiring isolation were first admitted to a general hospital without adequate isolation capabilities, and later transferred to a high-level isolation unit. Despite the fact that no outbreaks occurred in Europe, these experiences exposed weaknesses in terms of recognition, public health response, and diagnostic and clinical management. Indeed, despite the wide availability of national and international plans and guidelines, their application in 'real-life' scenarios remains poor. Not surprisingly, public health policies and diagnostic and clinical approaches to HIDs differ widely among European countries, and a common platform that would enable scientists to respond in a quick and powerful manner is still lacking.",

For these reasons, creating new networks and enhancing those functioning well should be strongly promoted, in order to: 1 ensure a rapid and effective response to health threats deriving from natural infection by or deliberate release of HID agents; 2 stimulate complementarity and prevent duplication; 3 promote international cooperation, exchange of experience, good practice and protocols; 4 support the less prepared countries in the European Community.",

The use of networking and international partnership could represent the successful strategy in this context. The traditional boundaries between basic science and clinical medicine should be dropped, and through effective networks the few HID events that occur worldwide should be studied thoroughly. A network of top-quality scientists and clinicians will provide the complementarity required for the development of these new approaches.

Innovative research and coordinated efforts, through the establishment of well-functioning networks, are the only way to deal with these issues, in order to improve preparedness and to react quickly: in short, to be 'prepared for the unknown'. A key role may be played by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, whose mission is, among others, to 'coordinate the European networking of bodies operating in the fields within the Centre's mission' [29] . Uncoordinated measures can lead to only partial and poor responses, and different approaches to similar health threats in various EU countries are likely to negatively affect the compliance by health professionals, and the perception of the population. Although well-functioning networks are already in place, many gaps still exist, as well as opportunities for future collaboration. Fortunately, new scientific developments, and new perceptions of these health threats, make this field one of the most stimulating research areas with a direct impact on the health of millions of people.",
