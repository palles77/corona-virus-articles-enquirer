Temporary migrant workers have been labeled as the major driving force for the rising incidence of infectious diseases in cities. However, it has not been well recognized that temporary migration indeed may have tremendous impacts on the spread of infectious diseases in migrants' home villages. In this paper, by proposing a delay differential equation model, we provide a framework to study the influence of temporary migration on the transmission of infectious diseases in a migrant workers' home village. The model is shown to admit a unique positive equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable and is globally asymptotically stable under certain conditions. This implies that the disease always persists at a constant level. Considering tuberculosis as an example, we explore various disease prevention and control strategies numerically to demonstrate how migration related parameters affect the early outbreak of the disease. We find that a single control strategy, such as reducing the migration time period alone, has little effect on reducing the disease endemic level. For disease prevention and control, temporary migrant workers should be identified as the top target group, and a combination of several prevention strategies should be implemented.",

Migrant workers (also called the floating population) emerged in China in the early 1980s when rural residents were allowed to seek employment in urban areas. Since then the number of migrant workers in China has been increasing dramatically. A report from the National Bureau of Statistics of China shows that there were a total of 145.33 million migrant workers in 2009, while the number in 1989 was only about 30 million.

At a young age, lacking education and professional skills, most temporary migrant workers have to work in construction sites, restaurants, or crowded factories that require no or little experience. Temporary employment and China's current existing household registration system make it very difficult for migrant workers to settle down permanently in urban cities. Thus they usually cannot access the social welfare benefits and health care available to urban residents (Zhang, 2001) . Unstable living and working conditions, being away from sexual partners, economic pressure, and limited awareness of infectious diseases all contribute to a high incidence of infectious diseases among migrant workers.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, no work yet has focused on the spread of infectious diseases in the migrants' home village. Influenced by the Chinese traditional culture, migrant workers regularly return home for holiday family gatherings (especially during the period of Chinese New Year). This mobility pattern may cause an epidemic outbreak in their home village if some of the returning migrant workers were infected with an infectious disease while they were away from their home. For instance, returning migrants with the AIDS virus can unknowingly pass it onto their sexual partners (Lau and Thomas, 2001) . In the meantime, migrant workers may also serve as a major vector for bringing the diseases to the urban areas when they return to work from their home village. Movement back and forth between rural and urban areas by temporary migrant workers is believed to be a key factor for the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases including TB and HIV/AIDS in China Strand et al., 2007; Wang and Shen, 2009 ).",

In the model, we have assumed that a fraction of returning migrant workers acquired infection when they were away from their home village. This model particularly applies to the huge migrant worker population in China. There has been evidence that migrant workers are more vulnerable to infectious diseases especially TB, HIV/AIDs and STDs because of migrant workers' high risk behaviors (Grusky et al., 2002; Li et al., 2004; Yang, 2006 Yang, , 2004 .",

The fact is that the proportion of new cases in migrants has been increasing year by year. It is reported that in 2006, the migrant population accounted for 1638 of 4088 TB cases in Beijing .

This may lead to re-emergence of rather under controlled diseases or emergence of new diseases in urban areas. But because of the current existing household registration system, different jobs and working conditions and different backgrounds, many temporary migrant workers are isolated, not only residentially, but also socially and culturally, from the ''mainstream'' society in the place where they temporarily live and work (Yang, 2006) . A report from the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau shows that the total annual new registered active TB cases increased dramatically from 2000 through 2006, but the cases among the permanent residents only increased slightly (Beijing Research Institute for TB Control Work on the prevention of TB in Beijing). Thus, from a disease prevention and control point of view, temporary migrants should be identified as the target group. Due to migrants' high mobility, lack of knowledge about infectious diseases, poor living and working conditions, and increased (sexual) risk behaviors, a combination of several effective interventions should be implemented.",

For example, all 28 confirmed measles cases reported between 1 January and 30 April 2008 in Canada were either imported or import-related (Lipskie and Varughese, 2008) . One Ontario case had arrived from Pakistan 10 days prior to rash onset.
