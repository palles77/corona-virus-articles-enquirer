This study aims to understand how family caregivers' mental health and caregiver burden affects physical health simultaneously, controlling for factors such as age, education level, caring hours per day, and emotional, functional, and physical support systems used by caregivers. We recruited 388 caregivers from Kaohsiung and Pingtong region in Taiwan. Caregivers had to be 18 years or older and spend most of their time taking care of an ill family member at home. Mental health was assessed by the 12-item Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ-12) and burden was measured using a modified scale for caregiver's burden. Health status was assessed by selfperceived health (SPH), illness symptoms and the number of diagnosed chronic diseases. A high number of hours per day of caregiving was associated with low emotional support and SPH, poor mental health and high burden. Higher emotional support was associated with better mental health and fewer illness symptoms. Higher physical support was associated with poorer mental health, higher burden, a greater number of illness symptoms and chronic diseases, and a lower SPH score. Hours per day of caregiving, and use of emotional, functional, and physical support were associated with mental health, and the hours per day of caregiving and use of physical support were predictors of burden. Mental health and burden were significantly associated with caregivers' health problems simultaneously. Our results show the important influence of mental health on caregivers' physical health. Interventions for caregivers need to target health in a holistic way.",

One study indicated that caregivers often experience several physical problems, including back injuries, arthritis, high blood pressure, gastric ulcers, and headaches (Sawatzky and Fowler-Kerry, 2003) . Although these physical problems may not be directly caused by caregiving responsibilities, they are likely aggravated by them. Other research has found that the physical health of caregivers of long-term patients declined after the patients were discharged from hospital (Douglas and Daly, 2003) .

Three major types of care systems are provided: institutions, community based care, and home care.

Home care is partly covered by the National Health Insurance, which pays for two home nursing visits per month. Most of these visits are to care for people with physical disabilities.

All of them are certified agencies and are covered by the National Health Insurance. However, only clients with a Barthel score less than 60 are eligible for the home care services provided by the government, which means that the dependency levels of clients are high. After excluding 12 agencies which care for less than 20 clients or that were converted to care for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients instead of home-care clients, 16 home-care agencies serving 588 cases were eligible. We included only those individuals who were 18 years or older and spent most of their time taking care of at least one ill family member at home. Among the eligible cases, 50 were institutionalized, 96 refused or did not complete the interview, and 54 were cared for by hired carers and their families could not be reached. This resulted in a total of 388 family caregivers ($66%) of clients served by these agencies, recruited between 20 June 2003 and 30 November 2003. All the clients were physically ill. Over half of them were unconscious (Chiou et al., 2005) , with 84.7% being totally dependent.

This may be due to a low level of awareness of the existence of these functional support systems or how to apply for them. Thus, based on our findings, the Taiwanese public health community and social service providers should strengthen and promote existing support systems as well as design new systems to ease the mental stress of family caregivers.

On the other hand, age was negatively related to burden score. It was possible that the older caregivers were more traditional people and accepted the role for caregiving. But as age increased the number of diseases increased and the selfperceived worsen. That implied that the older caregivers' health condition was decelerating even though they did not think the burden was heavy. The average duration of caregiving was around 194.5 months (16.2 years). The care receivers were around 70 years old. In Chinese society, most elderly people live with their children, especially their sons. Caring for ill family members can become a burden on the sons' families, particularly on the wives.
