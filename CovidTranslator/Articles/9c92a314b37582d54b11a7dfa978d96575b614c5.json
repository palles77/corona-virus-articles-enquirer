There was one patient (1%) who had moderate impairment of FVC, one patient (1%) who had moderate impairment of the FEV 1 /FVC ratio, and three patients (3%) who had moderate impairment of the DLCO. No pulmonary function abnormalities were detected in 59 patients (63%). Mean scores were significantly higher (ie, worse) than the population norms in the activity (p < 0.001), impacts (p < 0.001), and total (p < 0.001) domains of the SGRQ. Conclusions: One year after recovery from SARS, persistent pulmonary function impairment was found in about one third of patients. The health status of SARS survivors was also significantly worse compared with the healthy population. The main determinants of morbidity in recovered SARS patients need to be further defined.",

Although it has been \u03fe 1 year since the illness was successfully contained, published data on the condition of those who survived the illness are limited. Several studies [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] have reported persistent symptoms, as well as radiologic and functional abnormalities during follow-up several weeks or months after hospital discharge, but the prevalence and severity of the longterm sequelae of SARS remain largely unknown. Because lung function is known to improve for up to 1 year after discharge from the hospital in survivors of other causes of acute lung injury, 10, 11 it is imperative that long-term studies of SARS survivors be conducted in order to determine the persistence of abnormalities in pulmonary function, and whether these abnormalities contribute to permanent impairment and disability. As the majority of patients with SARS survive the illness 2 and medical personnel, physicians, nurses, and hospital workers are among those commonly infected in most countries, 2 an additional requisite for the identification and quantification of morbidity among survivors may be for the consideration of awarding compensation.",

Spirometry was performed in accordance with recommended standards. 14 All of the lung function tests were performed with the subjects seated and on the same day, but after patients had answered the health status questionnaire. FVC and FEV 1 were measured with a clinical spirometer (V max 229; SensorMedics; Yorba Linda, CA). Total lung capacity and its subdivisions were measured by the nitrogen washout method with the spirometer, the testing ad-hered to standard criteria. 15 The Dlco was determined by the single-breath carbon monoxide technique 16 using an infrared analyzer (V max 229). Dlco was adjusted for a hemoglobin concentration of 14.6 g/dL for men and 13.4 g/dL for women. 16 The spirometry, lung volumes, and Dlco measurements were expressed as the percentages of predicted normal values using reference values taken from the prediction equations of Chia et al 17 and Poh and Chia. 18 The rating of impairment was made according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) statement 19 for the evaluation of impairment/disability secondary to respiratory disorders.",

In assessing long-term outcomes after acute lung injury, it is important to attempt the consecutive enrollment of survivors with defined time points for study, because there is a possibility of bias toward the selection of sicker patients with abnormal pulmonary function test results if studies enrolled any patient who returned for a follow-up evaluation. In an earlier prospective study 9 of pulmonary function tests in 46 recovered SARS patients at a uniform time point of 3 months after hospital discharge, we found 7 patients (15%) with mild impairment of FVC, 12 patients (26%) with mild impairment of FEV 1 , 17 patients (37%) with mild impairment of Dlco, and 1 patient (2%) with moderate impairment of Dlco. Overall, pulmonary function defects were detected in half of the recovered SARS patients at 3 months after hospital discharge. The finding in the present study of persistent pulmonary function abnormalities in a significant proportion of SARS patients 1 year after hospital discharge is notable, not only for the long-term follow-up and management of these patients but also as a highlight of the permanent respiratory impairment that can result from the acute infection. Viral pneumonia usually resolves without any clinical or radiologic sequelae, whereas SARS-related radiologic sequelae appear to be quite common among survivors, as observed by several studies. 8, 21 The finding of higher prevalence of dynamic lung volume abnormalities than Dlco impairment in the present study, together with the significant improvement in Dlco but not dynamic lung volumes in serial lung function testing of a subset of our patients, suggest that Dlco abnormalities can improve with time. In contrast, ventilatory abnormalities are more likely to persist in the long term. This appears to be in contrast to information from several reviews 22,23 on survivors of the ARDS documenting the persistence of a mild reduction in Dlco as the most common abnormality found in pulmonary function testing, and that Dlco remained low in long-term follow-ups. Interestingly, all of the articles on ARDS survivors reporting normal lung volumes or very low rates of either obstruction or restriction were published earlier when cohorts were likely more heterogeneous, and lung injuries in the surviving population were most likely less severe. 24 -26 In more recent studies, the proportion of patients with ventilatory impairment has ranged constantly higher, from 18 to 33% for airway obstruction and from 15 to 45% for lung restriction. [27] [28] [29] [30] In particular, Neff et al 31 have reported that residual restrictive and obstructive types of functional impairment remained common (25% of patients with each type) in survivors of severe ARDS, and only 12.5% of patients had impairment in Dlco.",

Adverse long-term pulmonary sequelae of the ARDS include lung fibrosis, but untreated bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia and bronchiolitis obliterans may also contribute to the physical morbidity in ARDS survivors. 32 In addition, neuromuscular weakness may also contribute to the decline in pulmonary function. 33 A recent study 8 correlating high-resolution CT scan findings and pulmonary function in survivors of SARS during the early recovery phase (ie, 25 to 38 days after hospital discharge) found that FEV 1 , FVC, TLC, residual volume, and Dlco correlated well with the severity of ground-glass opacification and fibrosis. The presence of fibrosis was associated with significantly lower pulmonary function variables. It would be interesting to compare structural and functional changes in survivors of SARS during late recovery to see whether a similar correlation persists and whether these changes are different from those observed in ARDS survivors whose condition is not related to SARS.",

This is likely attributable to an improvement in symptoms with time of recovery. In studies among survivors of ARDS, it is known that nearly all of the patients are symptomatic at hospital discharge, but there is significant improvement over the first year after ARDS in most patients. 11 In addition, survivors of ARDS are also much less symptomatic than other patients with chronic lung disease. 11 Nonetheless, the mean activity score of our patients measuring disturbances to their daily physical activity and their mean impacts score covering a wide range of disturbances of psychosocial function remain significantly worse compared with those in healthy subjects. Physical morbidity in SARS survivors may also stem from extrapulmonary causes. In an earlier study 9 evaluating pulmonary function and exercise capacity among patients from the same cohort, we found no evidence of exercise limitation solely because of ventilatory constraints, and there were very few patients with significant oxygen desaturation during exercise. Hence, the disability represented by an increased (ie, worse) score on the SGRQ activity domain in the present study is not likely to be specific to intrinsic pulmonary dysfunction, especially given that pulmonary dysfunction in our patients is modest, but may instead reflect any cause of impaired physical functioning, such as muscle loss/weakness or neuromus- There are several limitations of this study that we would like to acknowledge. First, the heterogeneity of acute lung disease encompassed by the case definition of SARS may account for the observed variation in pulmonary and extrapulmonary sequelae among our patients. Second, the proportion of patients who declined evaluation may have led to a bias toward the selection of sicker patients with abnormal pulmonary function. This is likely, because most of the patients who declined participation in the study offered a lack of symptoms and inconvenience as the main reasons for doing so. Third, evaluations of arterial blood gas levels and exercise testing were not performed in this study. However, we did not anticipate that there was significant hypoxemia in these patients, because none of them was found to have hypoxemia or was assessed as requiring oxygen supplementation during routine follow-up. Cardiopulmonary responses to exercise in SARS survivors had been evaluated in an earlier study 9 at 3 months after hospital discharge, but we do not have any longer term data on this. Fourth, only a respiratory-specific measure of health status was used in this study. A generic health status measure, such as the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form health survey, would have provided a more global assessment of the patients, especially with regard to their role limitations as a result of emotional problems, mental health, bodily pain, and general health perceptions. The interaction of the data obtained from generic and disease-specific measures of health status may also have helped to determine the contributions of pulmonary and nonpulmonary factors to the longterm health status of SARS survivors.",
