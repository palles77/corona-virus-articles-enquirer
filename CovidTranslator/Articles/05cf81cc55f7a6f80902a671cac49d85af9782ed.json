Further characterization of HCoV-EMC suggests that this virus is different from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) because it is able to replicate in multiple mammalian cell lines and it does not use angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 as a receptor to achieve infection. Additional research is urgently needed to better understand the pathogenicity and tissue tropism of this virus in humans. In their recent study published in mBio, Kindler et al. shed some light on these important topics (E. Kindler, H. R. J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, M. Muth, O. J. Hamming, R. Hartmann, R. Rodriguez, R. Geffers, R. A. Fouchier, C. Drosten, M. A. M\u00fcller, R. Dijkman, and V. Thiel, mBio 4[1]:e00611-12, 2013). These authors report the use of differentiated pseudostratified human primary airway epithelial cells, an in vitro model with high physiological relevance to the human airway epithelium, to characterize the cellular tropism of HCoV-EMC. More importantly, the authors demonstrate the potential use of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) to control viral infection. Citation Chan RWY, Poon LLM. 2013.

SARS first struck in Guangdong Province, China, and was officially recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2003. After its introduction into human populations in Hong Kong in February 2003, the virus spread across the globe within weeks. A number of superspreading events occurred in several health care settings during the epidemic. When SARS was declared to have been contained (5 July 2003) , there were 8,098 confirmed SARS cases, and 774 of these patients died from the disease.

The virus can readily infect cell lines from multiple hosts, including humans, swine, monkeys, and bats, suggesting that it might have a relatively weak species barrier. In addition, many of these human cases/clusters are not epidemiologically linked. The first detected case dates back to April 2012 in the Middle East. It is not known whether there is a low level of circulation of this novel coronavirus in asymptomatic human carriers or if there is an animal reservoir that allows for multiple introductions of HCoV-EMC into humans.

So far, susceptibilities of the human pseudostratified bronchial epithelial culture to coronaviruses causing the common cold (e.g., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63) (6) and to SARS-CoV are comparable to that observed after HCoV-EMC infection. Interestingly, these human coronaviruses seem to have different cell specificities; non-ciliated cells are infected by HCoV-229E and HCoV-EMC, while ciliated cells are more prone to infections by HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and SARS-CoV. Nevertheless, this finding alone is not sufficient to explain their differential pathogenicities in humans. As acute pneumonia is one of the key presentations in HCoV-EMC infection in humans, the characterization of HCoV-EMC in tissues from lower respiratory tracts such as alveolar epithelial cells or alveolar macrophages might provide a more comprehensive picture of this novel disease.",

            "text": "The unusual severity of HCoV-EMC in humans, combined with its high fatality rate, is reminiscent of the clinical presentation of the SARS outbreak in 2003. SARS-CoV has strategies to limit host antiviral mechanisms by evading interferon (IFN) responses (8) . On the other hand, evidence from clinical and experimental studies suggests that SARS-CoV can induce cytokine dysregulation. Kindler et al. (5) delineate the immune response triggered by HCoV-EMC in HAE cultures by studying the proinflammatory gene expression profile upon HCoV-229E, HCoV-EMC, and SARS-CoV infection. The authors observed that both HCoV-229E and highly pathogenic coronaviruses can only marginally induce IFN and interferon-stimulating gene responses. In particular, HCoV-229E is found to be more capable of inducing proinflammatory gene expression, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423) and CXCL10, than the more pathogenic human coronaviruses. In contrast to the findings of Kindler et al., another previous study using well-differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells indicated that SARS-CoV induced higher cytokine and chemokine levels than HCoV-229E (9). This discrepancy may be attributed to different sampling times for cytokine and chemokine detection. In addition, one should note that SARS-CoV is known to modulate cytokine production by other key cells responsible for innate immunity in the lung (e.g., macrophage and dendritic cells) (10) . It is therefore essential to study HCoV-EMCinfected macrophages and dendritic cells. Furthermore, due to the nature of purified cell culture (e.g., HAE) models, cross talk between epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells cannot be evaluated. Additional experimental systems, such as ex vivo respiratory organ cultures and animal models, may provide further understanding of diseases caused by HCoV-EMC. In addition, clinical parameters determined from HCoV-EMC-infected patients would be extremely valuable for understanding the disease process in humans and could be used as a reference for data generated from in vitro and animal experiments.",

With these intense efforts, a great diversity of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses has been detected in bats (Fig. 1) . These findings suggest that bats might be the natural reservoirs of these two viral genera and that some of the bat coronaviruses might have adapted to other mammals in occasional spillover events in the past. Although the natural host for HCoV-EMC is yet to be identified, it is tempting to speculate that HCoV-EMC is of bat origin. In fact, recent bat coronavirus surveillance studies have indicated that a bat coronavirus (e.g., BtCoV/ VM314/2008) which is genetically closely related to HCoV-EMC can be detected in different countries in Europe (12) . But the sequence of this group of bat coronaviruses is still quite distinct from that of HCoV-EMC. This suggests that HCoV-EMC might be carried by an unknown bat species. Notably, bat coronaviruses that are genetically related to HCoV-EMC are all detected from Pipistrellus or Tylonycteris bats (Fig. 1) . Comprehensive virus surveillance of bats from these genera and others in the Middle East should be of top priority. Given the fact that SARS-CoV spread to humans via an intermediate host (civet cat) (13), other animals (e.g., poultry, pets, and game animals) that have frequent contacts with humans should also be tested. Assuming that the confirmed human cases/clusters were caused by multiple introductions of HCoV-EMC from animals to humans, identifying the source of this novel pathogen is still the key to preventing further spillover events.",
