In the present paper, groups of dogs were vaccinated twice with a commercial bacterin (EURICAN 1 L) containing Leptospira interrogans serovars icterohaemorrhagiae and canicola and challenged with heterologous representatives of both serovars at 2 weeks (onset of immunity) or 14 months (duration of immunity) after the second vaccination. Control dogs were not vaccinated against leptospirosis and kept with the vaccinated dogs. The challenges, irrespective of the serovar, reliably produced clinical signs consistent with Leptospira infection in the control pups with up to 60% mortality. As expected clinical disease in the adult controls was less severe, but we were able to induce morbidity and mortality as well. Under these extreme challenge conditions, clinical signs in the vaccinated dogs were rare, and when observed, mild and transient in nature.",

Despite the heavy challenges, none of the 18 vaccinated puppies (onset of immunity studies) and only 2 out of the 16 vaccinated adult dogs (duration of immunity studies) developed a renal carrier state. These results show that a primary course of two doses of EURICAN 1 L provided quick onset and long-term protection against both clinical leptospirosis and the renal carrier stage. This vaccine should provide veterinarians with a powerful tool to prevent clinical disease in dogs and zoonotic transmission of leptospirosis to humans.",

Leptospira (L) interrogans serovars icterohaemorrhagiae and canicola are the two serovars traditionally associated with disease in dogs (Hartman, 1984; Trevejo et al., 1998) , but new serovars play an increasingly important role (Scanziani et al., 2002; Ward et al., 2004; Moore et al., 2006; Geisen et al., 2007; Stokes et al., 2007) . Hence, leptospirosis is now recognised as an important re-emerging disease in dogs (Bolin, 1996; Ward et al., 2002) . While short-term clinical protection has been demonstrated experimentally in dogs after vaccination with several vaccines (Huhn et al., 1975; Andr\u00e9 -Fontaine et al., 2003; Klaasen et al., 2003; Schreiber et al., 2005a,b) , there is much debate on whether leptospirosis vaccines protect against the renal carrier state (Andr\u00e9 -Fontaine et al., 2003) or provide long-term immunity (Coyne et al., 2001) . As far as we know, we were the first to demonstrate 10 months duration of immunity against L. interrogans serovar canicola provided by a classical bacterin (Tronel et al., 1999) . Since then only one paper has been published demonstrating duration of immunity of 13 months for a commercial bacterin . In the current study, we confirm and extend our previous observations and demonstrate that two doses of EURICAN 11 L provide both rapid onset and duration of protective immunity of at least 14 months against both serovars icterohaemorrhagiae and canicola. The vaccine was evaluated for protection against clinical disease and prevention of the renal carrier state.",

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approvals were obtained before conducting the studies. In all studies, puppies were vaccinated twice subcutaneously, 4 weeks apart. Puppies were 8-9 weeks of age at the time of first vaccination. Dogs from studies 1 and 3 were challenged with L. interrogans serovar canicola at 2 weeks and 14 months, respectively, after the primary vaccination program of two doses. Dogs from studies 2 and 4 were challenged with L. interrogans serovar icterohaemorrhagiae at 2 weeks and 14 months, respectively, after the second vaccination of the primary vaccination course. Because it is difficult to induce clinical leptospirosis in adult dogs, two 2-4-month-old pups were added to studies 3 and 4 at the time of challenge to assess the severity of the infection. Following challenge, dogs were examined for the presence of clinical signs characteristic of leptospirosis. For leptospires isolation, blood and urine samples were collected at regular intervals, and a kidney and liver (study 4) sample were aseptically taken at necropsy. Blood was also sampled for serological, hematological, and biochemical analysis (study 4 only). At the end of the observation period or at death, dogs were necropsied, and organs were removed for histological examination.",

The incidence of moderate to severe disease was not significantly different between the vaccinated and control dogs (P = 0.124, Fisher's exact test). Due to the small number of dogs, the a posteriori power of the test was too low (0.15) to detect a significant difference. Twentyone dogs per group would have been needed to detect the same difference (30%) with a probability equal to 80%.",

            "text": "A number of factors must be considered in the design and evaluation of efficacy trials for canine leptospirosis vaccines. These factors include the age of the dogs, recommended vaccination schedule, selection of challenge strain, and challenge method. The ultimate goal of vaccination against leptospirosis is to protect dogs against clinical disease, as well as against the establishment of a renal carrier state. The latter protection is especially important because carrier dogs can be a public health hazard when in close contact to humans (Center for Disease Control, 1972; Trevejo et al., 1998) . Therefore, leptospirosis vaccines should be tested in models that reliably produce the series of clinical signs and renal colonization pattern that the vaccine is designed to prevent or reduce. Canine leptospirosis has been a difficult disease to reproduce under experimental conditions and usually requires the use of young puppies and a high challenge dose (Keenan et al., 1978) . Furthermore, clinical signs may vary depending on the isolate (Greenlee et al., 2004) , altered expression of bacterial proteins resulting from culture passage (Greenlee et al., 2004) , and the timing of harvest after hamster passage (Minke, personal observation). Even when taking these factors into account, reported infection in control dogs often results in no evident or subclinical disease (Broughton and Scarnell, 1985) . In only a few studies has severe lethal disease been reported following experimental infection of dogs with L. interrogans serovar canicola (Schreiber et al., 2005a; Kerr and Marshall, 1974) or L. interrogans serovar icterohaemorrhagiae (Schreiber et al., 2005b; Kerr and Marshall, 1974) . In our studies, puppies experimentally infected with L. interrogans serovars icterohaemorrhagiae and canicola developed a spectrum of disease that ranged from mild to lethal in severity. Renal, hepatic and hematological signs dominated the clinical presentation and supported the polysystemic nature of Leptospira infection. The overall mortality rate in control puppies was 60% and 58% for L. interrogans serovars icterohaemorrhagiae and canicola, respectively. Under these extreme challenge conditions, clinical signs in the vaccinated pups were rare, and when observed, mild and transient in nature. Clinical disease in adult dogs was less severe, but unexpectedly, we were able to induce morbidity and mortality in adult dogs as well, further demonstrating the severity of our challenge models. These results are in sharp contrast with those published by Klaasen et al. (2003) , where no evident clinical symptoms associated with canine leptospirosis were observed in the adult control dogs. The reason for this difference is not clear but may be attributable to the choice of challenge strain and/or challenge dose. Hematological parameters and blood biochemistry were not intended to be a major criterion to assess the efficacy of the vaccine, but they supported the diagnosis of leptospirosis. Thrombocytopenia was the main hematological abnormality observed in control dogs after challenge, while vaccinated dogs were protected against thrombocytopenia. This hematological disorder is a common finding in canine leptospirosis (Greene, 1998) and has been reported after experimental challenge (Tronel et al., 1999; Andr\u00e9 -Fontaine et al., 2003; Klaasen et al., 2003; Schreiber et al., 2005a,b) . Blood biochemistry illustrated the alteration of hepatic and renal functions in control dogs. Significant changes in urea nitrogen, creatinine, bilirubin, SGOT, and SGPT were observed only in the control dogs with severe clinical signs. The increased levels of SGPT in two vaccinated dogs did not correlate with the clinical observations. It cannot be ruled out that the massive challenge induced transient liver damage in those dogs. At necropsy, macroscopic examination of the animals was consistent with clinical signs, and typical lesions of leptospirosis were observed in dogs succumbing to the challenge. In addition, microscopic analysis showed that even surviving controls had lesions of interstitial nephritis compatible with leptospirosis, whereas no specific lesions were observed in the vaccinated dogs.",

            "text": "The second objective of our studies was to determine whether EURICAN 1 L would protect dogs against the development of a renal carrier state. As in many instances, isolation results on kidney and urine samples were not concordant in our studies, we defined a renal carrier as a dog with at least one positive urine or kidney culture. Discrepancies between urine and kidney isolation results have also been reported in the literature and were attributed to the presence of specific inhibiting enzymes from kidney cells (Faine, 1998) , high urine osmolarity and pH (Nervig and Garrett, 1979) , and the fact that leptospires are shed intermittently (Nervig and Garrett, 1979) . Overall we found that 100% of the control pups and 83% of the adult controls became renal carriers. Despite the heavy challenges, none of the 18 vaccinated puppies and only 2 out of the 16 vaccinated adult dogs developed a renal carrier state. It should be stressed that the challenge doses that we used were probably much higher than those observed in a natural infection, suggesting that the protection against renal carriage might be almost complete in the field. The literature has conflicting reports on the efficacy of leptospiral bacterins to protect against the renal carrier state. Much of the variability is likely the result of differences in the immunogenicity of the bacterins used, as was demonstrated by Andr\u00e9 -Fontaine et al. (2003) . In that study, only one of the three commercial vaccines completely protected dogs against the establishment of a renal carrier state shortly after primo-vaccination in a challenge model that induced no mortality and severe clinical disease in only one out of the six control puppies. Culture appeared to more sensitive in our hands than silver staining to detect leptospires in the kidney, with the additional advantage that infectious material is detected, rather than fragments of the bacteria. We did not explore alternative detection methods like PCR or immunofluorescence.",
