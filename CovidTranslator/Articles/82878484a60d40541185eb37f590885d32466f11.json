            "text": "Influenza infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially during pandemics outbreaks. Emerging data indicate that phase II antioxidant enzyme pathways could play a role in virus-associated inflammation and immune clearance. While Nrf2-dependent gene expression is known to modify inflammation, a mechanistic role in viral susceptibility and clearance has yet to be elucidated. Therefore, we utilized differentiated human nasal epithelial cells (NEC) and an enzymatic virus-like particle entry assay, to examine the role Nrf2-dependent gene expression has on viral entry and replication. Herein, lentiviral vectors that express Nrf2specific short hairpin (sh)-RNA effectively decreased both Nrf2 mRNA and Nrf2 protein expression in transduced human NEC from healthy volunteers. Nrf2 knockdown correlated with a significant increase in influenza virus entry and replication. Conversely, supplementation with the potent Nrf2 activators sulforaphane (SFN) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) significantly decreased viral entry and replication. The suppressive effects of EGCG on viral replication were abolished in cells with knocked down Nrf2 expression, suggesting a causal relationship between EGCG-induced activation of Nrf2 and ability to protect against viral infection. Interestingly, the induction of Nrf2 via nutritional supplements SFN and EGCG, increased antiviral mediators/ responses; RIG-I, IFN-\u03b2, and MxA at baseline in the absence of infection. Our data indicate that there is an inverse relationship between the levels of Nrf2 expression, and viral entry/replication. We also demonstrate that supplementation with Nrf2-activating antioxidants inhibit viral replication in human NEC, which may prove to be an attractive therapeutic intervention. Taken together, these data indicate potential mechanisms by which Nrf2-dependent gene expression regulates susceptibility to influenza in human epithelial cells.",

In the U.S. alone, over 20,000 people die and over 100,000 individuals are hospitalized every year due to influenza virus-related diseases [1] [2] [3] . Influenza viruses cause annual epidemics and recurring pandemics with potentially severe consequences for global public health. Despite large-scale efforts in vaccination and antiviral therapies, the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infections have not significantly changed in recent years [2] [3] [4] . The latest influenza pandemic was caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus and has thus far resulted in 42-86 million cases worldwide [5] . Epidemiologic studies show that high-risk groups including infants, elderly, and immune compromised individuals are more susceptible to influenza virus infections [6, 7] . In the context of potentially pandemic respiratory viral infections, it is important to identify and protect susceptible sub-populations through identification of molecular targets/pathways for therapeutic intervention. In spite of the large volumes of published data implicating age [1, 7] , pre-existing diseases [8] , nutritional deficiencies [9] [10] [11] , and an impaired innate immune response [12] [13] [14] in influencing susceptibility to infection, the mechanism(s) for viral susceptibility are very complex and have yet to be elucidated.",

There are a number of factors that may influence susceptibility to influenza infections in the human airway, specifically oxidant air pollutants, such as cigarette smoke, diesel exhaust, and ozone [18, 19] . Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates. Enzymes including phase II antioxidants such as hemeoxygenase 1 (HO-1), are regulated by the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The induction of these antioxidant enzymes can prevent or slow oxidative damage to cells. Emerging data indicate that Nrf2 plays an important role in the development of cancer, chronic lung diseases, defense against oxidants, as well as host defense against respiratory viral infections [20] [21] [22] . Although it has been shown that oxidative stress increases severity of viral infections, the exact mechanism as to how and why this happens and the role of Nrf2 in these responses are not fully understood.",

Upon infection, epithelial cells respond by producing numerous cytokines, immunoregulatory molecules, and antiviral mediators, all components of the host innate immune response. One of the principal mediators of this response are type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), which are secreted from virus-infected cells [23, 24] and are required to induce the synthesis and/or activity of mediators involved in turning off viral replication within the host cell. Although IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 act in an autocrine fashion to inhibit viral replication within the infected cell, it primarily functions in a paracrine mode by protecting neighboring cells that are not yet infected. The most potent stimulus for type I IFN synthesis are signals derived from a viral infection, specifically the recognition of double-stranded RNA that is produced by viruses during their replication process [25] . Another hallmark of influenza virus, is its sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of IFN-inducible MxGTPases (MxA), which significantly abrogates viral replication [26] .",

Importantly, we directly show an inverse relationship between levels of Nrf2 expression and susceptibility to viral infection. Interestingly, we demonstrate that enhancing Nrf2 expression via supplementation with SFN and EGCG, increased antiviral mediators in the absence of viral infection and also abrogated viral entry. Taken together, our data are consistent with the conclusion that Nrf2-dependent gene expression is an important modifier of susceptibility to influenza.",

This protocol was approved by the University of North Carolina School of Medicine Institutional Review Board for Biomedical Research. Primary human nasal epithelial cells were expanded to passage 2 in bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM, Cambrex Bioscience Walkersville, Inc., Walkersville, MD) and then plated on collagen-coated filter supports with a 0.4 \u03bcM pore size (Trans-CLR; Costar, Cambridge, MA) and cultured in a 1:1 mixture of bronchial epithelial cell basic medium (BEBM) and DMEM-H with SingleQuot supplements (Cambrex), bovine pituitary extracts (13mg/ml), bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1.5 \u03bcg/ml), and nystatin (20 units) .

Efficiency of the lentivirus to knock down Nrf2 gene expression was measured by isolating total RNA from transduced cells and utilizing realtime RT-PCR to quantitate Nrf2 mRNA transcripts normalized to cellular \u03b2-actin expression. Nrf2 mRNA expression was significantly knocked down by lentivirus LV-Nrf2 as compared to the control lentivirus (LV-scramble) ( Figure 1B) . Western blot analysis further confirmed that the expression of Nrf2 protein as well as HO-1, an Nrf2-dependent gene, was reduced, which correlated with the Nrf2 mRNA suppression ( Figure 1C ).",

As depicted, we saw a significant increase in the amount of viral HA mRNA produced in the cells when Nrf2 is knocked down as compared to our control. Similarly, by analyzing the apical washes for influenza viral titers, we again saw a significant increase in viral replication in cells with suppressed Nrf2 expression as compared to the control ( Figure 2B ). To validate the suppression of Nrf2 at the time of viral infection, cellular lysates were used to analyze protein levels of both Nrf2 and HO-1 ( Figure 2C ) Western blot analysis showed that expression levels of both Nrf2 and HO-1 were significantly reduced both pre-and postinfluenza infection.

Both compounds have the ability to induce Nrf2 gene expression. Based on initial dosing studies, we determined that a concentration of 1\u03bcM and 10\u03bcM is sufficient to detect effects of SFN and EGCG on Nrf2-dependent gene expression in NECs in vitro with 10\u03bcM causing cytotoxicity (data not shown). Therefore, NECs were treated with 1\u03bcM of either SFN or EGCG 3 h prior to infection with influenza virus. To explore the effects of these antioxidant compounds on viral replication, total RNA was isolated and resulting cDNAs quantified by RT-PCR to measure the levels of influenza HA transcripts present. As shown in Figure 3A , both SFN and EGCG inhibit viral replication as marked by decreased HA gene expression. We again collected apical washes to perform viral titer assays. Our results show that EGCG significantly reduced viral replication, while SFN had minimal affects ( Figure 3B ). Western blots revealed that the addition of SFN and EGCG did increase the protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1, with EGCG enhancing Nrf2 expression (approximately 3-fold) as compared to the vehicle ( Figure 3C ). Taken together, these results indicate that induction of Nrf2 via antioxidant supplementation suppresses influenza virus replication in NECs. To determine whether the effects of EGCG on replication are indeed mediated by Nrf2, we performed experiments whereby NECs were transduced with either LV-Nrf2 or LV-Scramble prior to treatment with EGCG. Figure 4 shows that there is an Nrf2-dependent effect. The suppressive effects of EGCG on viral replication were eliminated in cells with knocked down Nrf2 expression, suggesting a causal relationship between EGCG-induced activation of Nrf2 and ability to protect against viral replication.",

Figure 6A shows the microscopy of live cells in which the PR8 \u03b2-lacM1 VLP has entered the cells and cleaved the CCF2-AM substrate (green), disrupting FRET, resulting in CCF2 emission at 447 nm (blue), demonstrating feasibility of this assay. To determine the effects of Nrf2 expression levels on virus entry, BEAS-2B cells were transfected with either the LV-Nrf2 lentiviral vector to knockdown Nrf2 expression or a CMV-driven Nrf2 overexpression cDNA plasmid (CMV-Nrf2). The results show that the suppression of Nrf2 results in a significant increase in viral entry, but that entry can be blocked by overexpression of Nrf2 ( Figure 6B ). Finally we wanted to verify if antioxidant supplementation was involved with the entry portion of the virus life-cycle. Again, BEAS-2B cells were pre-treated with either SFN or EGCG prior to the infection with the PR8 \u03b2-lacM1 VLP.

Nrf2 is a multifunctional transcription factor that plays a role in chronic lung diseases, defense against oxidants, as well as host defense against respiratory viral infections [20, [40] [41] [42] . Although it has been shown that oxidative stress increases viral infection and antioxidants are thought to be protective against influenza, the exact mechanism as to how and why this happens and the role of Nrf2 in these responses have yet to be elucidated.

Modification of any or several of these factors by altering expression of Nrf2 could affect susceptibility to infection. Our results demonstrate that increased Nrf2 activity significantly reduces the expression of the viral HA gene as well as influenza virus titers (Figure 3 ). To dissect specific points in the virus life cycle that could determine the role Nrf2 gene expression plays in viral susceptibility and/or viral replication, which ultimately dictates viral pathogenesis and outcome, we developed an enzymatic viruslike particle (VLP) assay that was adapted from previous studies using VLPs to study HIV and Ebola virus entry [39, 44, 45] .

Based on previous reports, we hypothesize that increased viral entry and subsequent replication seen in cells with reduced Nrf2 expression/activity is mediated through the activation of host cellular transmembrane proteases. As indicated above, regulated proteolysis is required for the spread/propagation of many human viruses, including Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Nipah, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), metapneumoviruses, and influenza [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of proteases-specific cellular proteases/ antiproteases involved in influenza infection, which include transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), and secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLIP) [51, 52] . The expression of these proteases in the lung are necessary for cleavage of the viral HA surface protein, thus allowing viral fusion and entry into the host cell. Studies have shown a correlation between inflammation and oxidative stress which leads to altered expression of these proteases/antiproteases. Specifically, HAT has been shown to be released into the airway fluids under inflammatory conditions, particularly in asthmatics [53, 54] , and a murine study showed that SLPI gene expression was increased in Nrf2-deficient mice which lead to increased inflammation and demonstrated a balance between oxidative stress and protease expression [52] . These studies combined with our data presented here, lead us to hypothesize that oxidative stress which is propagated via decreased Nrf2 gene expression, causes an increase in serine protease activity, culminating in increased efficiency of HA cleavage and thus increased viron entry, which we demonstrated in Figure 6 .",

            "text": "Interestingly, our results demonstrate that supplementation with SFN and to a greater extent EGCG, increased not only Nrf2 protein levels, but also induced the expression of three wellcharacterized antiviral response genes which include RIG-I, IFN-\u03b2, and MxA ( Figure 5 ). It is worthy to note, that the increased expression of these antiviral genes were induced via supplementation with EGCG in the absence of a viral infection. It is known that infection and replication of viruses result in the accumulation of intracellular ssRNA and dsRNA in the host cell, which triggers multiple host response mechanisms, including the expression of type I INFs, MxA, and RIG-I. Viral infections normally induce the production of type I IFNs, which in turn activate the synthesis of numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs collectively induce an \"antiviral state\" in the host cell itself as well as the neighboring cells, thus limiting viral replication in these cells. One of these ISGs is MxA, which belongs to a small family of GTPases that have been shown to inhibit viral replication. MxA has also displayed antiviral activity towards influenza A virus [55] . Another IFN-inducible gene is RIG-I, which is a cytosolic DExD/H box-containg RNA helicase that interacts with dsRNA and augments interferon production in response to a viral infection [56, 57] . We demonstrate that treatment with EGCG, in the absence of a viral infection, increased the mRNA expression levels of RIG-I, which appear to be in contrast to a recent study which showed that EGCG suppresses Rig-I signaling [58] . This study identified, in a small molecule screen, that EGCG binds to RIG-I and reported that at certain concentrations EGCG efficiently binds to RIG-I, and while not interfering with RIG-I's ability to bind RNA, does suppresses RIG-I signaling. However, these studies were performed in the HEK293T cell line, which could contribute to the somewhat conflicting results. Based on our observations, we hypothesize that EGCG up-regulates the expression of these antiviral genes which proactively protects the cells prior to viral infection by inducing and \"antiviral protective state\". It is possible that IFN-\u03b2, RIG-I, and MxA genes may contain an Nrf2 binding site in there promoter regions, and the induction of Nrf2 would thus increase the transcription of these antiviral genes. However, at least to our knowledge, essential Nrf2 binding sites have not been identified in promoters of any of the genes listed above and studies examining gene expression profiling of Nrf2 in mice did not report differences in the antiviral or interferon responsive genes [40, 59] . It is conceivable that the effects of SFN and EGCG on IFN-\u03b2, RIG-I, and MxA expression is Nrf2-independent or that the effects are species and/or cell type specific. SFN and EGCG have been shown to have potent antioxidant capacities, in part by inducing the expression of a number of antioxidant enzymes [60] . In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that these supplements potently induce the expression of phase II antioxidant genes, which was associated with Nrf2-electrophile response element (EpRE) signaling [37, [61] [62] [63] . The mechanism of activation for Nrf2 induction involves serine/threonine phosphorylation, leading to increased nuclear accumulation and binding to the EpRE [64] . Whether and how activation of Nrf2-dependent gene expression is involved in its potential antiviral effects is not known. Our data show that EGCG and to a lesser extent SFN modifies influenza replication in human respiratory epithelial cells at 1\u03bcM concentration and that the effects of EGCG on viral replication are abolished in cells with knocked down Nrf2 expression ( Figure 2 ). It is likely that higher concentrations of SFN would yield significant effects on viral replication. These observations are similar to previous mouse in vivo studies showing that supplementation with SFN only reduced RSV infection in Nrf2+/+ mice but not Nrf2 \u2212 / \u2212 mice [17] . Previous studies have indicated that EGCG directly binds influenza virus and therefore prevents attachment and entry into host cells [65, 66] . However, these studies were conducted in MDCK cells, which are not a natural host cell for influenza and require addition of exogenous proteases to achieve viral entry [65] . Our data demonstrate that supplementation of differentiated NECs with either SFN or EGCG from the basolateral side (to eliminate direct interaction with the virus during infection) significantly decreases influenza virus entry and replication and that these effects were dependent on Nrf2 ( Figure  4 ).",

It has been reported that Nrf2 protects the lung against oxidative stress [20, 40] , and recent data describe functional polymorphisms within the Nrf2 gene in humans [67] . Nrf2 has been identified as a susceptibility gene that increases the risk of acute lung injury (ALI), and other reports have also identified a role for Nrf2 in pulmonary diseases associated with oxidative stress, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma [68, 69] . Viral infections have been shown to exacerbate these diseases. Understanding how Nrf2 orchestrates cellular defense mechanisms may provide insight to the development of novel interventions and preventative strategies targeted against oxidative airway diseases. Investigating antioxidant supplementation treatment along with potential inhibitors of influenza-activating type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) could be important additions to the current antiviral therapy which include targeting neuraminidase and the ion channel M2. Influenza infection remains a major global public health concern, and understanding the mechanisms that modulate susceptibility to influenza infection can have vast impacts on morbidity, mortality and ultimately infection outcome.",

            "text": "In summary, this work provides insight into identifying and understanding new molecular pathways in which Nrf2 gene expression potentially protect cells from viral infection. Our work demonstrates that activation of the Nrf2-dependent gene expression prior to influenza abrogates viral entry and replication. We also found that the transcription factor Nrf2 plays a critical role in dictating susceptibility to viral infection at the level of the epithelium. We have shown that nutritional supplementation, with SFN or EGCG, not only increases Nrf2 levels, but also increases the expression of multiple antiviral mediators in the absence of a viral infection. We hypothesize that induction of these antiviral mediators in turn initiates an \"antiviral state\" priming the cells against a viral infection, thus limiting virus entry and replication. Previous studies have demonstrated that in humans orally administered SFN at doses of 200\u03bcmole yield peak plasma levels reaching about 2\u03bcmol/L [70] . Similarly, previous studies determining pharmacokinetics of EGCG in humans, reported that a single dose of 1.5mmole orally administered EGCG achieved peak plasma concentrations averaging 1.3\u03bcmole/L [71] . Thus, levels of SFN and EGCG shown here to have antiviral effects are clinically feasible. Further studies aimed at using orally administered SFN or EGCG may provide great insights into potential novel antiviral therapeutic interventions.
