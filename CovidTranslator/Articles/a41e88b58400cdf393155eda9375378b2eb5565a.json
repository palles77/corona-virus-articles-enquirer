Quality refers to the extent to which the research design, implementation, and analysis limit the possibility of bias. Quantity is the number of research studies that have evaluated the research question and the strength of the findings across samples. Consistency is the degree to which the studies that address the same research question report similar findings. 2 Hierarchies, or levels of evidence, are used to provide clinicians with a method for evaluating the quality of the evidence, which usually ranges from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized-controlled trials at the highest level to expert opinion. 3 Across versions of these hierarchies, it's clear that expert opinion, whether from an individual or a committee, is least likely to control for bias. However, in the case of caring for patients with a potentially lethal infectious disease such as EVD, expert opinion based on lab findings, observations in the field in West Africa, and now limited practical experience in the United States has quickly become a way of problem solving in a broader context that includes safety for both the patient and healthcare provider.

Simulation exercises in full PPE included nursing and medical procedures, waste management procedures, communication strategies, and equipment handling and documentation requirements.

The second aspect was the level of staffing. Although the number of full-time equivalents was high, we believed the cautious approach was the safest approach.
