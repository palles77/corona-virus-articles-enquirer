The reason behind this is that during this 258 epidemic, Chinese and Shanghai government has issued very strong and strict measures 259 in restricting the transmission in local regions. The national transport department 260 announced a 45% and 70.6% decline in the passenger flow at the beginning and the end 261 of 2020 Spring Festival, respectively [13] [14] . What's more, Shanghai government 262 cancelled all gathering activities and through propaganda of the officials, media and 263 community, citizens were well-informed and well-educated of the importance of wearing 264 face masks and washing hands frequently. Previous studies have suggested that the 265 mobility reduction could not effectively lower the incidence rate while 50% transmissibility 266 reduction could easily prevent the epidemics from further spreading [12] . In the case of 267 Shanghai, the transmissibility was indeed greatly reduced, however, we believe the 268 mobility reduction also played an indirect role in lowering the transmissibility. This is 269 because that Chinese Spring Festival is characterized by hundreds of millions of people 270 transporting from one region to another, and this massive gathering at the airports, train 271 stations during transportation, if not controlled, would significantly increase the human to 272 human transmission. Therefore, during this special period, controlling both mobility and 273 transmissibility might be important. Other doubt lies in that previous studies have reported 274 that the ascertainment rate in Wuhan is 5.1% [11] , and suggested that other cities such as 275 Shanghai, Beijing have the similar ascertainment rate, which would lead to our local case 276 numbers fall below the true ones.

First, regional mortality rate varies widely in the early 315 stages of the disease outbreak because it is affected by many factors, such as life support 316 equipment for critically ill patients and local medical conditions. In the absence of effective 317 antiviral drugs, the proportion of critically ill patients depicts the natural course of the 318 disease better than the mortality rate. Second, because the final clinical outcome of 319 majority of the reported cases is typically unknown during a growing epidemic, dividing the 320 cumulative reported deaths by reported cases will underestimate the mortality rate early in 321 an epidemic [17] . We believe that the proportion of severe illness in Wuhan is biased 322 towards detecting severe cases, partly because diagnostic capacity is limited at the start 323 of an epidemic.

Up until now, multiple studies have described the clinical characteristics 84 of the COVID-19, including fever, fatigue, cough etc. Various researches reported intensive 85 care unit (ICU) admission rate between 19.1% to 32%[7-9], but this data mainly came from 86 Hubei regions, and it might be biased towards detecting severe cases at the beginning of 87 the epidemic. Thus, clinical features from regions outside Hubei can further assist the 88 understanding of the disease's epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Shanghai 89 reported its first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in January 20 th 2020, and the total 90 confirmed cases have reached to 333 cases by February 19 th . As one of the global 91 metropolis, Shanghai faces a relatively higher epidemics danger due to the substantial 92 population mobility, and the risk is even doubled as Chunyun(a huge population flows 93 during the Spring Festival) collided with the epidemics. During this outbreak, Shanghai has 94 issued a number of strict measures to lower the transmissibility, including the shutdown of 95 all large entertainment venue, reducing passenger flow and very strong social propaganda. 96",
