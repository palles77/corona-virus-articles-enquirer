Objective: To examine whether three ways of visually presenting data (heat map, dot map, or pictotrendline)-all depicting the same information regarding the spread of a hypothetical outbreak of influenza-influence intent to vaccinate, risk perception, and knowledge. Design: Survey with participants randomized to receive a simulated news article accompanied by one of the three graphics that communicated prevalence of influenza and number of influenza-related deaths. Setting: International online survey. Participants: 16,510 adults living in 11 countries selected using stratified random sampling based on age and gender. Measurements: After reading the article and viewing the presented graphic, participants completed a survey that measured interest in vaccination, perceived risk of contracting disease, knowledge gained, interest in additional information about the disease, and perception of the graphic. Results: Heat maps and picto-trendlines were evaluated more positively than dot maps. Heat maps were more effective than picto-trendlines and no different from dot maps at increasing interest in vaccination, perceived risk of contracting disease, and interest in additional information about the disease. Heat maps and picto-trendlines were more successful at conveying knowledge than dot maps. Overall, heat maps were the only graphic to be superior in every outcome. Limitations: Results are based on a hypothetical scenario. Conclusion: Heat maps are a viable option to promote interest in and concern about infectious diseases.",

While these diseases have affected different populations with varying severity, public knowledge of each outbreak has been spurred through multiple modalities-by traditional patient-healthcare provider relationships and also by news outlets [1, 2] , local health departments [3] [4] [5] , international health organizations [6] [7] [8] , and social media [9] [10] [11] . For instance, during the H1N1, Ebola, and Zika outbreaks, topics discussed through social media included risk factors, prevention, experience, and disease trends [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . http To communicate disease prevalence and spread, visuals often matter more than words [17] [18] [19] . Graphics developed for public health purposes are widely disseminated through social media [20, 21] . Much like the spread of a disease, outbreak-related graphics and videos inspire a cascade of additional tweets and Internet searches [20, 22] . Therefore, the effect different visualization strategies have on the general public is particularly relevant to public health experts.",

On one hand, graphics are often able to circumvent problems with literacy and numeracy that may be encountered when attempting to communicate risk [23] . The use of graphics has repeatedly been demonstrated to improve patient understanding, enhance decision-making, and shape risk perception [24, 25] . On the other hand, the design of visuals can also have a negative impact on understanding and reactions to information. For example, even accurate graphics may distract individuals from relevant statistical information [26] . In addition, while most people may prefer the graphical presentation of data, graphics may affect perceptions of risk idiosyncratically [27] [28] [29] . Yet, graphics remain a cornerstone of the broad dissemination of public health knowledge [30, 31] .",

            "text": "Data visualization has increased the popularity of alternative methods to presenting statistical information. For instance, projects such as Gapminder [38] have developed animations of world income distribution and global health that are easy to understand. However, to our knowledge, this work is the first to experimentally evaluate visualization strategies to communicate infectious disease prevalence to the general public. Numerous studies have evaluated the impact of graphics on risk communication [24, 25] . However, this prior work has primarily focused on communicating to individual patients-particularly the risks and benefits individuals would receive as a result of a medical procedure. While epidemiologists have long used graphical displays to illustrate the spread of disease [39, 40] , that work has focused on delivering information to highly trained public health specialists. In contrast, this study assesses graphics that communicate disease prevalence to the general population, simulating that their country is at the epicenter of an infectious disease outbreak. This type of communi-cation is especially relevant to public health and government officials seeking to provide broadly accessible health information. As the lay public receives more of its health information multidimensionally, from healthcare experts, news, and social media, it is critically important to evaluate the most appropriate graphics used to communicate disease prevalence, spread, and risk. Understanding optimal communication strategies is of particular importance in relation to influenza, where vaccination greatly reduces the risk of contracting disease [41, 42] ; yet, vaccination rates remain suboptimal [43] . Prior research related to public health communication and influenza has demonstrated that the general public prefers brief, balanced, and evidence-based messages [44] [45] [46] . However, there is currently no standard method for the graphical communication of epidemiological data to the lay public. The WHO and the CDC used a combination of dot and heat maps during the recent Ebola outbreak to depict prevalence [30, 31] . Dot maps appear most often in the literature [32, [47] [48] [49] . However, heat maps have been discussed infrequently in the literature. In one study of Europeans interested in weather forecasts, a color contour map featuring hypothetical forecasts was preferred over six other more typical formats of graphical presentation of data, such as bar graphs, pie charts, and line graphs [50] . Yet, we found that while both heat maps and pictotrendlines were preferred over dot maps, the use of heat maps to demonstrate the spread of disease increased interest in vaccination compared to the use of picto-trendlines and no differently than dot maps. Furthermore, dot maps appeared to be the worst method to convey information, as respondents with dot maps had less knowledge gained from the graphic compared to those with heat maps and picto-trendlines. Thus, unlike dot maps and picto-trendlines, heat maps achieved the trifecta-greater respondent preference, increased interest in vaccination, and better translation of knowledge. Graphics must also be carefully examined to assess both their potential positive and negative impact. Visuals can produce a wide variety of emotional responses that may be difficult to predict [23, 27] . Furthermore, it is often difficult to adequately illustrate uncertainty in risk communication [51] ; however, this becomes even more imperative when presenting graphics at the population level, since risk may vary greatly between individuals and across locations. Experimental evidence remains limited as to how different graphics are processed and understood [51] ; therefore, additional research is necessary to evaluate the impact of public health graphics aimed at the general population. In particular, it is unclear how other modes of communication, such as animations and videos, impact public health communication. Our prior work using animation in the context of cancer treatment options suggests that animated graphics may result in suboptimal risk communication [52] .",

First, we chose three graphics to present to participants, but other graphics not presented in this study could be better suited to communicate disease prevalence. However, these graphics were chosen based on a pilot study in which these three graphics were the most promising. In addition, this study used graphics to accompany text, which may have a different effect than graphics viewed in isolation. Second, each respondent viewed a single graphic; however, no single graphic may suit the communication needs of all individuals. Furthermore, in this study, the picto-trendline graphic contained data only on the participant's country, compared to heat maps and dot maps, which included data on surrounding countries. However, including additional data in the pictotrendline graphic may increase its complexity and decrease its efficacy. Third, while differences seen in this study were statistically significant, it is difficult to project whether they are clinically relevant. Fourth, preferences in this study were developed based on a hypothetical scenario, which may not correspond with preferences during an actual pandemic of influenza. For example, we examined interest in future vaccination, which may not be perfectly correlated with actual vaccination. However, vaccination intentions are strongly associated with subsequent vaccination [53] . Additional research is necessary to determine how these graphics affect actual vaccination rates. Finally, our study sampled participants from Europe and the United States and may not be generalizable to developing nations.",
