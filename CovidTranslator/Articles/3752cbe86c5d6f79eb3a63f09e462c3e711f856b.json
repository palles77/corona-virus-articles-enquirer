            "text": "Background In patients with hematological malignancies, febrile neutropenia (FEN) is the most frequent complication and the most important cause of mortality. Various risk factors have been identified for severe infection in neutropenic patients. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is not defined whether there is a change in the risk of febrile neutropenia according to seasons. The first aim of study was to determine the difference in frequency of febrile neutropenic episodes (FNEs) according to months and seasons. The second aim was to document isolated pathogens, as well as demographical and clinical characteristics of patients. Methods In the study, 194 FNEs of 105 patients who have been followed with hematological malignancies between June 2013 and May 2014 were evaluated retrospectively. Results Although the number of FNEs increased in autumn, there was no significant difference in frequency of FNEs between months (p = 0.564) and seasons (p = 0.345). There was no isolated pathogen in 54.6% of FNEs. In 45.4% of 194 FNEs, pathogens were isolated. Of all pathogens, 50.4% were gram negative bacteria, 29.2% were gram positive bacteria, 13.3% were viruses, 5.3% were fungi, and 1.8% were parasites. Conclus\u0131ons The frequency of FEN does not change according to months or seasons. Also, the relative proportions of different pathogens in the cause of FEN do not vary according to seasons.",

Among these, circulatory and respiratory system infections are the most common. While gram negative bacteria were the most frequently detected infectious agents up until the 1980s, gram positive bacteria became the most common factors in the following years, due to increased use of vascular catheters, prophylactic antibiotic applications, and toxic intestinal chemotherapy applications. However, in recent years, the rate of gram negative bacteria has increased again [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Commonly seen gram positive bacteria are S. aureus, coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS), and Streptococcus species; gram negative bacteria include E. coli, Klebsiella species, and P. aeruginosa [10] .

However, there is an increase in the frequency of infections due to myelosuppression and immunosuppression caused by the disease itself and current treatments. Studies show that life-threatening infection occurs in 48-60% of FEN patients [13] . Seasonal patterns of infection can be observed for some of the viruses that cause the common cold. In temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, the frequency of respiratory infections increases rapidly in autumn, remains fairly high throughout winter, and decreases again in spring. In tropical areas, most colds arise during the rainy season [14, 15] . Based on the presence of seasonal viral infection patterns, this study investigated whether there was a similar seasonal change in FNEs. It was found that there was no difference in frequency of FNEs according to months and seasons. The probable reason why there is no difference according to months and seasons is that the pathogens are largely caused by endogenous flora.",

The proportion of gram negative bacteria was significantly higher (approximately twice as much) than the ratio of gram positive bacteria. Among all pathogens, E. coli was the most common (21.2%). Also, these pathogens did not show any change according to seasons. Therefore, empirical antimicrobial therapy does not require a change according to the seasons. FEN is a medical emergency and empirical treatment should be started as soon as possible. The aim of empirical therapy is to cover the most likely and most virulent pathogens that may rapidly cause life-threatening infections. Therefore, clinicians need to be aware of the current microbiology surveillance data from their own institution, which can vary widely from center to center. This allows for better management of the process with selection of more appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy.",
