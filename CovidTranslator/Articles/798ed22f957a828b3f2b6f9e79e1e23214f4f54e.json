RT-LAMP primers were designed for IBV-S2 targets and optimized to run at 60\u00b0C for 45 min. As compared with RT-PCR, RT-LAMP was 100 times more sensitive for IBV-S2 gene. RT-LAMP showed specific amplification with IB viral genome but not with other avian respiratory pathogens due to their mismatching with IBV-S2-RT-LAMP primers. RT-LAMP reaction products were visually detected by the addition of propidium iodide stain. Out of 102 field samples tested for detection of IBV, RT-LAMP detected IBV in 12 samples for S2 gene whereas RT-PCR detected IBV in six samples for S2 gene. The sensitivity of the RT-LAMP was 100 % and the specificity was 94 % for S2 gene. Since the developed RT-LAMP to detect IBV is simple, rapid, sensitive and specific, it can be a useful diagnostic tool for detection of IB in poultry in less equipped laboratories and in field conditions.",

There are several limitations with these techniques such as VI is laborious and time consuming, antibody based techniques require specific monoclonal antibodies for each strain, and real-time PCR is expensive and requires expertise. RT-PCR is the most widely used molecular technique to detect the IB viral genome either in allantoic fluids from embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) inoculated with field samples or directly from the tissue samples. However, it requires an expensive thermal cycler to carry out the reaction. Several authors used different targets like the nucleoprotein gene (N-gene) [10] [11] [12] , Spike protein 2 (S2) [13] [14] [15] , Spike protein 1(S1) [16, 17] , M [18] and 3 0 -UTR [19] to diagnose IB by RT-PCR.",

The optimum volume of components in the reaction mixture included 10 pmol each of F3 and B3 primers, 40 pmol each of FIP and BIP primers, 2.5 mM dNTP, 10 mM MgSO4, 1 M betaine, 40 U of MMLV Reverse transcriptase, 8 U Bst polymerase and 3 ll of extracted template RNA (1 lg). At 608 C for 45 min, the product from LAMP was better than that in other temperatures and time (data not shown). Hence, 60\u00b0C and 45 min were considered as the optimal temperature and time for IBV-S2 gene RT-LAMP respectively. Alternatively, visual inspection of RT-LAMP amplification products in the reaction tubes was carried out by using propidium iodide. A positive reaction tube containing IBV-specific amplicons exhibited a pink color, while the contents within the negative control tube showed the original orange red color and under the UV-transilluminator, the positive sample showed fluorescence and negative sample showed absence of fluorescence. The lowest EID 50 of viral genome in RT-PCR detectable upon gel electrophoresis was found to be 10 3 EID 50 (Fig. 2a) and for RT-LAMP it was 10 EID 50 for IBV-S2 gene (Fig. 2b) . The results indicated that IBV-RT-LAMP assay is 100 times more sensitive for S2 gene than RT-PCR assay. Further, the sensitivity is similar to the results of the RT-LAMP for IB-N gene viral genome detection reported by Chen et al. [25] who reported a sensitivity of 10 EID 50 . Luo et al. [26] reported a sensitivity of 10 6 fold diluted RNA for RT-LAMP targeting 1a gene of IBV.",

The IB viral genome was detected by RT-LAMP and RT-PCR in 12 and six samples for S2 gene respectively (Table 2) . Among different tissue samples tested, more positive results were seen for kidney samples when tested by RT-LAMP (n = 6) than by RT-PCR (n = 3) whereas the results were similar in both the tests for trachea and caecal tonsils. The sensitivity of the RT-LAMP was 100 % and the specificity was 92 % for S2 gene. The analysis of field samples by RT-LAMP indicated increased percent positivity (13.7 %) when compared with the RT-PCR (5.9 %). This increased percent positivity is due to the higher sensitivity of RT-LAMP (10 EID 50 ) than that of RT-PCR (10 3 EID 50 ) for the detection of IB viral genome and this is in accordance with the results of Xu et al. [22] who showed that the RT-LAMP was 157 % sensitive than the RT-PCR in detecting IBD viral genome in field samples. RT-LAMP positive samples were further confirmed by using ECE as well as by sequencing the RT-PCR products which used F3 and B3 primers of RT-LAMP. The sequencing result showed that these samples were of M41 genotype. Thus, as the results indicate that the detection limit of RT-LAMP for IB viral genome is higher than the RT-PCR and the reaction time is 45 min only, this technique is more rapid than the RT-PCR. Moreover, the addition of dyes such as propidium iodide to the end product alleviates the use of electrophoresis. Hence, RT-LAMP for IB viral genome detection can be used as a routine diagnostic tool in avian disease diagnostic laboratories in which sophisticated equipments such as thermal cycler and electrophoresis apparatus are not available. In addition, RT-LAMP for IB viral genome detection can be used as a field diagnostic test.",

Initially, RT-LAMP reaction was carried out at different temperatures (60, 62 and 64\u00b0C) for 90 min with termination temperature of 80\u00b0C for 5 min. The reaction temperature that showed clear ladder-like pattern was used in subsequent reactions and incubated at different reaction times (45, 60 and 90 min) to select the optimum reaction time. At the end of the reaction, an aliquot of RT-LAMP product (5 ll) was subjected to electrophoresis on 2 % agarose gel. Analytical Sensitivity and Specificity of RT-LAMP to Detect S2 Gene of IB Viral GenomeThe analytical sensitivity of RT-PCR and RT-LAMP using RNA for S2 gene target was assessed in terms of the lowest EID 50 of allantoic fluid of IB vaccine from which the RNA extracted gave a positive amplification in RT-PCR and RT-LAMP. To assess the specificity of the RT-LAMP and RT-PCR primers of S2 gene, RNA from Newcastle disease virus, DNA extracted from reo virus and avian leukosis virus samples were used in RT-LAMP and RT-PCR.",
