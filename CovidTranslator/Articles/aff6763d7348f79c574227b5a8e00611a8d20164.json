            "text": "Previous studies suggested that the otitis media (OM) complication rate of viral upper respiratory infection (vURI) is conditioned by genes aVecting cytokine production. Two hundred and thirty children (114 male; 187 White, 25 Black; aged 1-9.3 years, average = 3.6 \u00a7 1.6 years) were prospectively followed over the typical cold season for cold-like illness and OM. Nasopharyngeal secretion samples collected during cold-like illness and OM were assayed for upper respiratory viruses and buccal samples were assayed for TNF (\u00a1308), IL-10(\u00a11082, \u00a1819, \u00a1592), IL-6 (\u00a1174) and IFN-(+874) polymorphisms. Logistic regression was used to identify genotypes that predict OM coincident with RSV and rhinovirus (RV) infection. Of the 157 children with RV detection (79 male; 132 White, 13 Black, 12 Other; aged 3.6 \u00a7 1.5 years), simple logistic regression identiWed age (B = \u00a10.34, Z = \u00a12.8, P < 0.01, OR = 0.71), IL-6 (B = \u00a10.76, Z = \u00a13.3, P < 0.01, OR = 0.47) and IL-10 (B = 0.49, Z = 2.0, P = 0.05, OR = 1.6) as signiWcant predictors of OM coincidence. A more complex logistic regression model for RV detection that included selected OM risk factors identiWed these factors as well as the TNF genotype, OM history, breastfeeding history and daily environment as signiWcant predictors of OM coincidence. Of the 43 children with RSV detection (21 male; 35 White, 5 Black, 3 Other, aged 3.9 \u00a7 1.7 years), logistic regression identiWed IL-10 (B = 1.05, Z = 2.0, P = 0.05, OR = 2.9) as a signiWcant predictor of OM coincidence. New OM episodes coincident with evidence of RSV and RV infection were signiWcantly more frequent in children with high production IL-10 phenotypes. The low production IL-6 and high production TNF phenotypes also contributed to OM risk during RV detection. Cytokine polymorphisms may be one of an expectedly large number of genetic factors contributing to the known heritability of OM.",

New OM episodes can present with (acute OM, AOM) or without (OM with eVusion, OME) signs and symptoms associated with bacterial infection of the middle ear [1] . OM onset as either AOM or OME is most often coincident with a cold-like illness (CLI) that is usually the symptomatic expression of viral upper respiratory infection (vURI) with rhinovirus (RV), RSV, inXuenza, parainXuenza, or adenovirus among others [2, 3] . Epidemiologic studies show that most OM episodes are short-lived and self-resolving with or without treatment, but that a subset persists as a long-standing asymptomatic condition, chronic OME [1, 4, 5] . Also, a subpopulation of children often labeled \"otitis-prone\" is characterized by numerous, repeated episodes of AOM (recurrent AOM, rAOM) [4] . A common treatment for both persistent OME and rAOM is tympanostomy tube insertion that was shown in clinical trials to be eVective in resolving persistent OME and preventing recurrences of AOM [6, 7] .",

Families at two study sites (Pittsburgh, Charlottesville) with two children between the ages of 1 and 5 years were recruited for participation by advertisement.

After aYrmation of willingness to participate and acquisition of written informed consent, families were entered into the study in October with an anticipated follow-up through April of that year and were reimbursed for participation. The study subjects included the two index children and any older sibs less than 10 years of age who provided assent. The study data consist of demographic information, genotypes for selected cytokine polymorphisms, weekly assignments of the presence/absence of OM and detections of upper respiratory virus in the nasopharynx by PCR assay of nasal secretions.

RV was detected at least once in 157 children and RSV was detected in 43 children. A new OM episode was associated with 77 (49%) of the Wrst RV detections and with 25 (58%) of the Wrst RSV detections (P = 0.31, Fisher's exact test). Twelve (16%) of the OM episodes associated with RV and 14 (56%) associated with RSV detection were classiWed as AOM (P < 0.01, Fisher's exact test). Table 1 reports the distributions of cytokine phenotypes for all subjects and for those with RV and RSV detections. Notably, all phenotypes were represented in these populations at reasonable frequencies for statistical analysis and, with the exception of IL-10 in the RSV subgroup, the frequencies of the phenotypes were remarkably similar among the populations. For IL-10, the low production phenotype appeared to be over-represented and the intermediate production phenotype under-represented in the RSV subgroup (P > 0.10, 2 test). These results do not support an eVect of cytokine phenotype on RSV or RV infection. Figure 1 shows the OM coincidence for Wrst RV and RSV detections as a function of the TNF , IL-10, IL-6 and IFN phenotypes. For both viruses, the high production IL-10 phenotype and the low production IL-6 phenotype were associated with greater OM coincidences. There were no apparent diVerences among the TNF and the IFN phenotypes with respect to that measure. For the RV subgroup, 138 children (71 male; 113 White, 13 Black, 12 Other; aged 3.5 \u00a7 1.5 years) had supplemental data on the OM risk factors. By parent report, 41 (30%) children had a positive history for OM; the daily environment was listed as \"home with the mother\" for 60 (43%) children; the number of children in the family was 2 in 61, 3 in 51 and 4 or more for 19 of the children; only 20 (15%) children were exposed to tobacco smoke, and the majority of children (n = 109, 79%) were breastfed, with most (n = 74, 54%) being breastfed for 3 months or longer. Table 2 reports the signiWcant predictors identiWed by the more complete logistic regression model for the coincidence of new OM episodes during Wrst RV detection. Younger age, a past history of OM, daily environment that was \"not home with the mother\", a longer period of breastfeeding, high production IL-10 and TNF phenotypes and low production IL-6 phenotype were signiWcant predictors of new OM episodes during RV detections.",

            "text": "The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that cytokine phenotypes predict the coincidence of OM during new detections of nasopharyngeal viruses (interpretable as vURIs caused by the viruses) in young children. The assayed polymorphisms, TNF (\u00a1308), IL-10 (\u00a11082, \u00a1819, \u00a1592), IL-6 (\u00a1174) and IFN-(+874), were chosen to represent those included in the earlier report [16] . The analyses focused on the OM coincidence of RV and RSV detections because of the small number of detections for other assayed viruses which severely limited the power of statistical testing. For both RV and RSV detections, a logistic regression model that included age, race, sex and the cytokine phenotypes identiWed the high production IL-10 phenotype as a signiWcant predictor of new OM episodes. The large number of RV detections allowed for a more complex logistic regression model that included selected OM risk factors. As expected from previous reports [23] , younger age, a positive history of OM and a daily environment outside of the home were signiWcant predictors of OM coincidence. Unexpectedly, a positive history of breastfeeding also predicted OM coincidence which is directionally opposed to most previous reports. However, it should be noted that the majority of children in this study were breastfed and, consequently, the eVect of breastfeeding may have resulted from random distributional linkage of breastfeeding with other, unmeasured, risk factors. None-the-less, that analysis identiWed the high production IL-10 and TNF phenotypes and the low production IL-6 phenotype as sig-niWcant predictors of OM coincidence. With available data, the discrepancy between the results of the current study where OM coincidence of RSV infection was driven by the IL-10 haplotype and the previous study where that coincidence was driven by the IFN genotype cannot be explained. One possibility is that this reXects the diVerence in the ages of the study populations (young infants vs. children). SpeciWcally, past studies show a role for IFN in suppressing RSV infection [24] and document a shift during early infancy from a TH2 (low IFN ) biased to a TH1 (high IFN ) biased immune response [25, 26] . There, the higher production IFN phenotype in young infants with a TH2 bias may allow for suYcient IFN to decrease RSV complications, but be inconsequential in older children with a TH1 bias where suYcient IFN is constitutively produced.",

A variety of study designs are applicable to testing these hypotheses including those that attempt to identify discriminators of the otitis-prone condition [12] [13] [14] and/or of children with chronic OME, and those that, like the present study, focus on possible mechanisms (relating cytokine polymorphisms to a pathway of disease pathogenesis) [14, 16, 27] . However, there are a large number of cytokine polymorphisms (as well as polymorphisms in other signaling molecules [14, [28] [29] [30] ), and there are no clear rules for the judicious choice of which of these polymorphisms should be included in any given study. Moreover, the complexity of the signaling pathways involved in host inXammatory responses with feedback ampliWcation and inhibition suggests that cytokine haplotypes be included as predictors, though this is hardly practical given the very large number of possible haplotypes. Guidance in these issues is expected when the data from more detailed genetic linkage studies of OM risk available, but it should be noted that none of the cytokine genes lie in the chromosomal regions identiWed as containing suspected genes aVecting a child's experience with tympanostomy tube insertion [11] . None-the-less, with these caveats and adequate justiWcation for the choice of assayed polymorphisms, continued study along the lines advanced above is likely to yield important information regarding the genetic basis for OM susceptibility.",
