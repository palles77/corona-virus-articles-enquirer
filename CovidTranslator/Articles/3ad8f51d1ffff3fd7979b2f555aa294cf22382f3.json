Unlike those required for Golgi retention influenced not only by direct interactions between cytoin animal cells, this signal is not simply determined by plasmic sequences and vesicle coat proteins, but also by TMD length but is dependent on the amino acid sequence, the nature of their membrane-spanning segments. and thus is likely to be recognized by a protein. Surpris-Key components of the transport system that themselves ingly, residues along one helical face of the TMD are also must be sorted are the SNARE proteins. These are crucial for Ufe1p function, but the sequence requirements membrane-bound receptors found on the target membranes for function are distinct from those for ER retention. TMD (t-SNAREs) and on transport vesicles (v-SNAREs) that sequences have also been implicated in the sorting of interact specifically during vesicle docking and promote another yeast ER protein, Sec12p, and a putative sorting vesicle fusion via the NSF and SNAP fusion machinery (S\u00f6llner et al., 1993a,b) . In the budding yeast Saccharo-receptor, Rer1p, has been identified. However, targeting by the Ufe1p TMD can occur in the complete absence of Rer1p, implying that it occurs by a novel mechanism. Using Ufe1p as a reporter molecule, we have also investigated TMD-mediated sorting in the later parts of the yeast secretory pathway. Attempts to map the retention signals of yeast Golgi enzymes have focused on the distinction between a Golgi and a vacuolar location; unlike in animal cells, overexpressed or chimeric proteins do not seem to accumulate on the plasma membrane (Chapman and Munro, 1994; Lussier et al., 1995) . These findings, together with an apparent lack of localization signals in vacuolar membrane proteins, have suggested that the vacuole is the default destination for membrane proteins in yeast, and that some so far unspecified signal is required to reach the cell surface (Roberts et al., 1992; Nothwehr et al., 1993) . We find that the choice between plasma membrane and vacuole is dictated by TMD length and (when length is limiting) by amino acid composition, but not by the precise sequence. This supports a lipid-based sorting mechanism as proposed for animal cells. However, yeast differs from animal cells in that a longer TMD is required to ensure transport to the surface, and that proteins with relatively short TMDs are not restricted to the Golgi apparatus but can also reach the endosome/vacuolar system.",

When overexpressed, both N-terminally myc-tagged (data not shown) and N-terminally GFP-tagged Pep12p showed a unique steady-state pattern, often spatially adjacent to but not coincident with the vacuole, and most often consisting of one to three discrete structures within the cell (see Figure 6B , comparison of vacuolar and Pep12p staining highlighted by arrows). This pattern is typical of exaggerated endosomal structures (Raymond et al., 1992) . When the TMD of Pep12p was replaced with that of Sso1p, joined at a naturally occurring KpnI site nine residues N-terminal to the TMD, no change in the distribution of Pep12p was observed, the chimera remaining in the endosome (construct PO; Figure 6B ). We conclude that targeting of these t-SNAREs to the plasma membrane and vacuolar branches of the secretory pathway is not wholly that it alone is capable of directing a protein to the ER. Second, we have shown that when Ufe1p is mislocalized to the late part of the secretory pathway, the choice presence of two Phe residues in UUO2, since these have been shown to disfavour plasma membrane targeting in between the plasma membrane and the vacuole/endosome system is strongly influenced by the length and composi-animal cells (Munro, 1995) . Taken with the results from the gradual extension of the Ufe1p TMD, our data suggest tion of the TMD.
