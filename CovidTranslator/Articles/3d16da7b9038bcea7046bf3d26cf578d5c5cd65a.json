            "text": "Giardiosis and cryptosporidiosis are frequently diagnosed in calves at the large animal clinic of the veterinary school. Few studies have been reported in the literature regarding pathogenesis of these two intestinal protozoa. The aims of this study were to follow the histological changes in the villi and crypts and the changes in the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes in the jejunum of naturally infected calves during the acute phase of infection. For this purpose, 29 calves aged between 7 and 10 days were bought at a local auction. The animals were housed in individual pens to avoid cross-contamination. Fecal samples were examined microscopically for the presence of Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts, three times per week for a period of 45 days. Six calves did not pass any cysts or oocysts and were used as controls. Fifteen calves passed Giardia cysts only, five passed both cysts and oocysts, and three passed oocysts only. The villus to crypt ratio index was 1.76 in the control group and 1.08 in the Giardia-infected group. In the Cryptosporidium-infected calves, the ratio was 1.18 and calves infected with both parasites had an index of 1.37. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes per millimeter of jejunum tissue was 21 in the control group. This number was doubled in the calves infected with Giardia, but was slightly lower in the other infected groups. All of the infected calves had intermittent diarrhea and mucus was seen in many fecal samples. \u00a9 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

            "text": "Giardiosis is the most widespread intestinal protozoal disease of humans in the world. Not only is the infection diagnosed in developing countries, but it also occurs among people living in developed countries where public hygiene is good and water supplies are purified and piped. Today, epidemiological studies indicate that infections are spreading not only in humans, but also in farm animals (Xiao, 1994) . The first case of giardiosis in cattle was reported by Fantham (1921) . Since this first report, many studies on the incidence of giardiosis in cattle have been reported (Deshpande and Shastri, 1981; Buret et al., 1990) . However, the pathogenesis of intestinal mucosal damage in cattle giardiosis has received little attention. After infecting calves in the laboratory with bovine Giardia isolates, studied cellular infiltration and villus atrophy in the jejunum of infected calves. After a pre-patent period of 8 days, all calves excreted cysts during a maximum period of 112 days. Intestinal blunting, flattening of the villi and cellular infiltration of the mucosa of the small intestine were present. They also observed that these changes also occured when the intestine was densely populated by bacteria and viruses . In humans, the distribution of trophozoites is practically unknown since the small intestine is accessible only by invasive techniques involving intubation. However, trophozoites have been detected in the duodenum and proximal jejunum of infected patients (Ferguson et al., 1990) . Using the gerbil-Giardia lamblia animal model, Campbell and Faubert (1994) found that trophozoites are distributed evenly in the small intestine. In humans and laboratory animal models, it has been reported that Giardia trophozoites are capable of causing a decrease in the villus to crypt ratio (VCR) at the site of infection. For example, it has been reported that gerbils infected with 2 \u00d7 105 G. lamblia trophozoites have a significant decrease in the VCR during the acute phase of the infection (Belosevic et al., 1989) . Meanwhile, the presence of acute inflammatory cells in the epithelial layer was reported in clinical human giardiosis (Hoskins et al., 1967) . Intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) counts, performed both in adults (Gillon, 1985) and children (Ferguson et al., 1976) , showed high numbers at the time the patients passed cysts in the feces.",

Approximately 10 g of feces was mixed thoroughly with 10 ml of tap water and stirred through a gauze into 15-ml centrifuge tubes. The filtrate was centrifuged for 2 min at 1500 rpm. The supernatant was discarded and the sediment resuspended in a zinc sulfate solution with a specific gravity of 1.18. The tubes were centrifuged again for 2 rain at 1500 rpm. After centrifugation, the tubes were filled to the rim with zinc sulfate solution and covered with a coverslip touching the meniscus. After 2 min, the coverslip was then placed on a glass slide and examined unstained with a microscope at 200 X or 400 X magnification for a period of 5 rain. A direct examination technique was used to detect Cryptosporidium oocysts (Casemore et al., 1985) . Fecal samples were taken three times per week during a period of 6 weeks, and were examined within the first 36 h after collection.

There was no correlation between the IEL and the duration of infection with Giardia (0.1 < P < 0.95).

            "text": "The data obtained in this study show that only the group of calves infected with Giardia spp. had a reduced VCR. However, the number of IEL per mm of tissue increased significantly in the three groups of infected calves, when compared to the non-infected group. It appears that the morphological changes in the jejunum, together with the increase in the number of IEL, can be attributed to the presence of these two protozoans since the results of tests for detecting the presence of bacteria and viruses were negative. We have observed an important range in the VCR value and the number of IEL per mm of tissue. The low number of calves per group and the infective dose are likely to be important factors in this variation. Furthermore, the animals were naturally infected and we were not able to determine the intensity of the infection. On the other hand, the state of the immune system at the time of infection, together with the variation in virulence of different strains, are also important factors to consider in the variability of pathogenesis. We have ruled out these two parameters as explanations for the variation in our data. The calves were all of the same age, were in excellent health and all originated from the same region. Therefore, it is unlikely that the immune system might have played an important role or that the animals were infected with different strains. From a clinical point of view, the results emphasize the difficulties in diagnosing these infectious diseases. Animals may be infected with a low number of parasites that are not detectable by routine fecal examination or they may show few clinical signs or evidence of pathology. However, they remain as an important source of contamination for the herd since they may be carriers of the parasites. All the infected calves in this experiment had episodes of diarrhea lasting 2-3 days. Recently, it has been reported that lambs infected in the laboratory with Giardia also became diarrheic (Olson et al., 1995) . The calves infected with Cryptosporidium spp. in the present work did not have a reduced VCR and this was attributed to the fact that the site of Cryptosporidium is the ileum, not the jejunum (Barker et al., 1993) . On the other hand, villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, in response to infection with Giardia, are well known phenomena. The infection is more detrimental to the mucosal architecture of the upper portion of the small intestine. Buret et al. (1992) observed an increase in the numbers of immature enterocytes, which appears to be associated with crypt hyperplasia. In human giardiosis, it has been reported that malabsorption is associated with a low VCR and high numbers of IEL present in the jejunum. In our study, an elevated VCR was associated with a low number of IEL in the jejunum. It is worth mentioning that the mixed infection caused less morphological damage in the jejunum than was the case when the calves were infected with a single parasite. These results are contrary to our hypothesis, since we reasoned that a mixed infection would exacerbate the pathogenesis and the clinical signs caused by infection with only one of the protozoans. It is possible that the low number of calves in the group with the two parasites (five) was not enough to observe differences. Another possibility would be that the parasites may have an antagonistic effect on each other rather than a synergistic effect. The housing of calves in individual pens did not prevent cross-contamination since, at the time of housing in the barn, there were only three calves infected with Giardia spp. and two calves infected with Cryptosporidium spp. In less than a month, all the animals became infected. We believe that the common procedures of husbandry were responsible for the rapid spread of the infection amongst the herd.",
