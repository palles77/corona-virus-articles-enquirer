In Viet Nam, human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus have occurred since 2003 1 and cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in 2004. The socio-demographic and clinical features relating to these infections in Viet Nam have been previously described. 2-7 Although SARS has not reappeared, sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza viruses continue to occur. As of November 2011, Viet Nam has recorded the third highest number of avian influenza cases and second highest number of related deaths globally. 5 More recently, the rapid spread of the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic 2009 strain (hereafter referred to as A[H1N1]pdm09) into Viet Nam resulted in many thousands of laboratory-confirmed cases and 58 associated deaths during the first epidemic Correspondence to Thomas Tran (e-mail: thomas.tran@mh.org.au).",

Such laboratory capacity would provide early warning to Vietnamese public health authorities of an outbreak of infection of importance to human health, knowledge of which could be passed on to other countries in the region, including Australia. A second aim was to use the established polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods to test respiratory samples collected from patients attending a local general hospital as proof of principal that staff training and transfer of technology were adequate.

Modifications to the published methods involved replacement of subtype-specific (H1 and H3) primers with primers specific for the influenza A matrix gene and the addition of primers to enable HCoV-NL63 detection. The primer sequences targeting the influenza A virus matrix gene and HCoV-NL63 are shown in Table 1 . Differentiation of rhinoviruses from enteroviruses involved testing of picornavirus-positive specimens in an enterovirusspecific nested PCR as follows: 2.5\u03bcl of cDNA was added to a final first-round mastermix volume of 40\u03bcl with primers ENTC and ENTD ( Table 1) . Subsequent cycling conditions were 95\u00b0C for three minutes followed by 35 cycles of 30 seconds at 95\u00b0C, 30 seconds at 53\u00b0C and 30 seconds at 72\u00b0C, with final extension of five minutes at 72\u00b0C. Two microlitres of first-round PCR product were then transferred to a second round mastermix containing second-round primers ENTB and ENTC. Second round amplification was for 25 cycles at the conditions described above. The final PCR product was analysed on an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.",

The district population was 241 173 in 2009. In the same year, the 200-bed hospital treated a total of 19 516 patients, 927 with suspected pneumonia and 1654 with upper respiratory tract illnesses. The choice of the NTPI as the participating laboratory in Viet Nam was made by the Viet Nam Ministry of Health because laboratory capacity existed in the north (Ha Noi) and south (Ho Chi Minh City) but was less developed in the central regions of the country. Support to NTPI involved transfer of test methods and purchase of equipment suitable for rapid throughput testing.

A(H1N1) pdm09 infected mainly children and young adults, in contrast to influenza A(H3N2) infections, which mainly occurred in children under five-years-old ( Table 3) . Two large influenza B epidemics occurred during the study, peaking in the wet seasons of 2008 and 2010 but also circulating at low levels during the dry season in both years.

The detection of an influenza H5 virus, albeit a non-pathogenic strain, in a patient presenting with symptoms not suggestive of influenza infection, prompted an investigation of asymptomatic household contacts, each of whom returned negative results. During the 2009 influenza outbreak, locally trained medical, nursing and scientific personnel collected, transported and tested large numbers of specimens within a short turnaround time. Transfer of technology and the training of local scientists were the essential elements in this process. Our study shows that the availability of appropriate equipment and molecular-based diagnostic testing contributes to important individual and public health outcomes in geographical locations susceptible to emerging infections.",

The adenoviruses were often associated with co-infections, making their clinical significance unclear. Parainfluenza virus circulation spanned wet and dry seasons. and the elderly. HCoVs were also detected throughout the year across all age groups, albeit in low numbers. OC43 was the most common coronavirus, with a distribution that spanned the wet and dry seasons in 2008 through 2009 and 2009 through 2010 (Table 2,Figure 1).",
