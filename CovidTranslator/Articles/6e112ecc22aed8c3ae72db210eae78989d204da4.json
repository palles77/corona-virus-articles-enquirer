Probes are single stranded reverse transcribed mRNAs, each located at a specific spot of the chip for hybridization with its Watson-Crick complementary sequence in a target to form the double helix (e.g., Schena 1999; Stears et al. 2003) . Microarrays currently use two forms of probes, namely, oligonucleotide (shortly, oligo) and cDNA, and have prevalently been used in the analysis of gene expression levels, which measures the amount of gene expression in a cell by observing hybridization of mRNA to different probes, each targeting a specific gene. With the ability to identify a specific target in a biological sample, microarrays are also well suited for detecting biological agents for genetic and chronic disease (e.g., Eom et al. 2004; Heller et al. 1997; Lee and Lee 2003; Liu et al. 2003) . Furthermore, as viral pathogens can be detected at the molecular and genomic level much before the onset of physical symptoms in a patient, the microarray technology can be used for an early detection of patients infected with viral pathogens (e.g., Sengupta et al. 2003; Vernet 2002; Wang et al. 2002; Zhou et al. 2005) .",

            "text": "The success of microarrays depends on the quality of probes that are tethered on the chip. Having an optimized set of probes is beneficial for two obvious reasons. One, the background hybridization is minimized; hence true gene expression levels can be more accurately determined (e.g., Li and Stormo 2001) . The other, as the number of oligos needed per gene is minimized, the cost of each microarray is minimized or the number of genes on each chip is increased, yielding oligo fingerprinting a much faster and more cost-efficient technique (e.g., Borneman et al. 2001; Li and Stormo 2001) . Short probes consisting of 15-25 nucleotides (nt) are used in genotyping applications (e.g., Stears et al. 2003) . Having short optimal probes means a high genotyping accuracy in terms of both sensitivity and specificity (e.g., Li and Stormo 2001; Sengupta et al. 2003) , hence can play a key role in genotyping applications. For example, in a pandemic, an effective method for selecting short optimal probes may be used in the mass production of a cost-efficient device for screening for the disease in suspected or susceptible hosts. Reverse genetics would be the most rapid means by which to produce an antigenically matched vaccine in a pandemic (Webby and Webster 2003) . An effective probe selection methodology can identify conserved regions of a viral family and hence may prove useful in the preparation of a vaccine via reverse genetics. Furthermore, the methodology can promote the availability of affordable home testing kits for accurate and confidential diagnosis of genetic and infectious disease and allow advanced and adequate medical treatment planning for patients.",

The probe design, say, for genotyping applications, can be roughly stated as selecting oligo probes for detecting a specific disease-agent in genomic sequences, hence falls into the realm of classical classification. Thus far, this interesting problem at the intersection of molecular biology and optimization has received relatively little attention from the optimization community, and systematic oligo design methods proposed so far are based on a simple greedy procedure (Herwig et al. 2000) , the set covering-based classification methodology (Borneman et al. 2001) , support vector machines (Lee and Lee 2003) , an evolutionary algorithm (Eom et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2004) , and mixed integer and linear programming (Klau et al. 2004) , briefly summarizing.",

Second, for example, the complexity of viral flora, owing to constantly evolving viral serotypes, requires a supervised learning theory to be trained on a large collection of target and non-target samples. That is, a typical training set contains a large number of large-scale samples. Furthermore, a supervised learning framework usually requires a systematic pairing or differencing between each target and non-target samples during the course of training a decision rule (e.g., Borneman et al. 2001; Boros et al. 2000; Klau et al. 2004; Rahmann 2003) .

            "text": "Based on a general framework of logical analysis of data (LAD) from Ryoo and Jang (2005) , we develop in this paper a probe design method for selecting short oligo probes of length l nt, where l \u2208 [6, 10]. To list some advantages of selecting oligo probes by the proposed method, first, the method selects probes via sequential solution of a small number of compact set covering (SC) instances, which offers a great advantage from computational point of view. To be more specific, consider classification of two types of data and suppose that a training set is comprised of m + target and m \u2212 non-target sequences. The size of the SC training instances solved by the proposed method is minimum of m + and m \u2212 orders of magnitude smaller than optimization learning models used in Borneman et al. (2001) and Klau et al. (2004) , for instance. Second, the method uses the sequence information only and selects probes via optimization based on principles of probability and statistics. That is, the probability of an l-mer (oligo of length l) appearing in a single sequence by chance is (0.25) l . Unless statistically significant, an l\u2212mer appearing in multiple samples of one type and none or only a few of the sequences of the other type by chance is extremely small. Third, the proposed method does not rely on any extra tool, such as BLASTn (Altschul et al. 1990 ), a local sequence alignment search tool that is commonly used for probe selection (e.g., Sengupta et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2002; Wang and Seed 2003) , or the existence of pre-selected representative probes (e.g., Sengupta et al. 2003) . This makes the method truly stand-alone and free of problems that may possibly be caused by limitations associated with external factors. As mentioned earlier, the proposed probe design selects optimal probes via sequential solution of SC instances. Although SC is N P-complete (Garey and Johnson 1979) , its wide practical applications have invited an array of efficient (meta-)heuristic solution procedures to be developed. Therefore, last, the proposed method is readily implementable for efficient selection of oligo probes. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we specialize a LAD framework from Ryoo and Jang (2005) for efficiently analyzing genomic sequences and develop an effective method for selecting short oligo probes. In Sect. 3, we test the proposed probe design algorithm in various in silico genotyping experiments using viral genomic sequences and report superb experimental results. To summarize, in all monospecific and polyspecific genotyping experiments on classification of viral pathogens using genomic sequences obtained from the National Center of Biotechnology Information website, the proposed probe design method selected a small number of probes of length 7 or 8 nt that perfectly classified all unseen testing sequences. Classifying the \"noisy\" human papillomavirus (HPV) sequences from the Los Alamos Laboratory by high and low risk types, the proposed probe design method selected optimal probes in a few CPU seconds that classified the testing sequences with 90.6% accuracy. For comparison, Eom et al. (2004) and Park et al. (2003) experimented with the same HPV dataset and reported the classification accuracy of 85.6 and 81.1%, respectively. These in silico results demonstrate efficacy and efficiency of the proposed oligo design method and further illustrate the usefulness and potential of a well-designed optimization-based probe design method in the forthcoming era of biotechnology. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes the paper with a few remarks.",

A typical implementation of LAD analyzes data on hand via four sequential stages of data binarization, support feature selection, pattern generation and classification rule formation. As a Boolean logic-based, LAD first converts all non-binary data into equivalent binary observations. A + (\u2212) \"pattern\" in LAD is defined as a conjunction of one or more binary attributes or their negations that distinguishes one or more + (\u2212) type observations from all \u2212 (+) observations. The number of attributes used in a pattern is called the \"degree\" of the pattern. As seen from the definition, patterns hold the structural information hidden in data. After patterns are generated, they are aggregated into a partially defined Boolean discriminant function/rule to generalize the discovered knowledge to classify new observations.",

To make these experiments as \"realistic\" as possible, we design each of these experiments based on information from the literature and the official website of the World Health Organization (WHO) and use viral genomic sequences obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and human papillomavirus (HPV) sequences from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. To be more specific about the data used, we obtained the HPV data from the Los Alamos National Laboratory site for illustrative and comparative purposes. These data correspond to the 72 high and low risk HPV sequences that are used in Eom et al. (2004) and Park et al. (2003) . Although some of these manually classified virus sequences contain classification errors (Eom et al. 2004 ), we used the data with Table 1 , we provide the number and the length (the minimum, average \u00b1 1 standard deviation and maximum length) of each type of the genomic data used in our experiments. In analyzing data in an experiment, we first decided on a length of oligos to use by calculating the smallest integer value l such that 4 l became larger than or equal to the average of the lengths of target and non-target sequences of the experiment. Then, 4 l candidate oligos were generated to fingerprint and binarize the data. If the length of oligos turned out to be not long enough during the pattern generation stage (see Remark 2), the data binarization stage was repeated with the value of l incremented by 1 and this process was repeated until the binary representations of the data became contradiction free. Next, procedure SC-pg was applied to generate patterns, hence, probes. In applying procedure SC-pg in these in silico experiments, we did not consider any oligo picking criterion that is non-theoretical in nature (refer to Remark 4) and selected a minimal set of oligo probes with using c j = 1 for all j \u2208 N . For solving the unicost (SC-pg \u2022 i )'s generated, we used for ease of implementation the textbook heuristic procedure (e.g., Nemhauser and Wolsey 1988 ) that selects one variable at a time by the rule",

Extensively tested on genomic sequences obtained from the National Center of Biotechnology Information and the Los Alamos National Laboratory in various monospecific and polyspecific in silico experiments, the proposed probe design method was able to select a small number of oligo probes of length 7 or 8 nucleotides that performed superbly in classifying unseen testing sequences. These in silico results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed oligo design method. Experimental results further illustrate a huge potential a well-designed optimization-based probe design method has in hybridization-based genotyping applications.",
