These strategies were tested during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. This article assesses pandemic preparedness in Taipei in the wake of recent pandemic experiences in order to draw lessons relevant to the broader international public health community. Drawing on Taiwan and Taipei Centers for Disease Control data on pandemic response and control, we evaluated the effectiveness of the changes in pandemic response policies developed by these governments over time, emphasizing hospital and medical interventions with particular attention paid to Traffic Control Bundling. SARS and H1N1 2009 catalysed the Taiwan and Taipei CDCs to continuously improve and adjust their strategies for a future pandemic. These new strategies for pandemic response and control have been largely effective at providing interim pandemic containment and control, while development and implementation of an effective vaccination programme is underway. As Taipei's experiences with these cases illustrate, in mitigating moderate or severe pandemic influenza, a graduated process including Traffic",

In late April 2003, the first outbreak of SARS occurred in one municipal hospital in Taipei. Soon, Taipei became the centre of a SARS outbreak that spread over the entirety of Taiwan in the span of six weeks. 7 By late June, SARS had caused 73 fatalities in Taiwan, affecting physicians and nurses as well. 8 SARS was a highly contagious, emerging infectious disease (EID) that, just like influenza, was spread through droplet aerosols and contact transmission. When countermeasures were taken to control the epidemic, the initial efforts suffered weaknesses including lack of adequate inter-organizational coordination, an unclear chain of command, inefficient resource allocation, poor risk communications, and disrupted information flows. The consequence was a total of 347 casualties, of whom 70% were from healthcare-associated infections and 30% were of healthcare workers (HCWs). 7, 9, 10 Lessons from the post-SARS evaluation of pandemic response",

Reforms included revising the surveillance system, and improving educational and support systems. Annual inspection and onsite audits were also initiated, and in compliance with the 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) hand hygiene campaign, alcohol dispensers coupled with hand disinfection checkpoints first implemented during SARS were incorporated into Taiwan's hospital disease control strategy. 11, 12 To increase HCW protection from nosocomial infections and EIDs, an additional step by the government included funding annual seasonal influenza vaccinations for all HCWs and emphasizing hand hygiene strategies. Although not mandatory, vaccination programmes were included in the accreditation and inspection process by the TCDC as of 2003. The average annual rate of vaccination against seasonal influenza by HCWs is currently around 90%. The emphasis on hand hygiene strategies has had a direct impact on reduced MRSA nosocomial infections in Taiwan. 13 The TCDC also developed a systematic and integrated approach for countermeasures against highly contagious EIDs based on the Incident Management System (IMS) and Six Sigma. The IMS describes a chain of command and control system that consists of four components: action, planning, financing, and logistical support. It can be applied to any scale of disaster and enables the TCDC to coordinate responses across institutional spheres. 14 'Six Sigma' is a principle of process management that originated from industrial engineering and management systems. This tool simplifies complex processes into smaller, more manageable steps that can be more easily analysed to set control points in approaching a final product, achieving a failure rate of less than three per million. 15, 16 The TCDC deploys the principles of IMS and Six Sigma to enhance its efforts in the key spheres of Traffic Control Bundling, Communicable Disease Control Networks, and Crisis Management.",

Such incorrect assumptions led to some HCWs' exposure to, and acquisition of, SARS. 9,17e20 At the peak of the SARS epidemic, and in coordination with the TCDC, the Taipei CDC developed a new mechanism for integrated infectious disease control, namely Traffic Control Bundling. Traffic Control Bundling includes the following procedures: triaging and dispatching patients before they enter the hospital; confining confirmed patients in a contamination zone; confining HCWs in a clean zone before entering the contamination zone; and installing dispensers with 75% alcohol for gloves-on hand sanitation at checkpoints so as to increase the pervasiveness of handwashing between zones of risk. Heightened handwashing and clearly delineated zones of risk improve hand hygiene compliance from an average of 30% to 100%. 21 The Traffic Control Bundling protocols were tested in a pilot hospital with promising results (Figure 1 ). 22 During the threeweek study period, only two HCWs in the pilot hospital acquired SARS, which was significantly lower than the 93 cases in the control hospitals (0.03 vs 0.13 cases per isolation bed, respectively, P \u00bc 0.03). Given this significant difference and the fact that the pilot hospital had the highest proportion of SARS patients in Taiwan without the benefit of a single negative pressure isolation room, the TCDC mandated that the newly developed Traffic Control Bundling protocols be immediately implemented across all of Taiwan's hospitals.",

Among them, 18 hospitals had HCWs infected by SARS; the remaining 33 hospitals had no cases of HCW-acquired nosocomial SARS infections. A univariate analysis demonstrated significant protective effects arising from reliance on Traffic Control. HCWs benefited from establishing fever screening stations, triaging fever patients, cohorting SARS patients, separating the entrances and traffic routes ( Figure 1 ) for patients and HCWs, and increasing facilities for handwashing (P < 0.001). A multiple logistic regression found that triage with fever-screening stations outside the emergency department (ED) and setting up alcohol dispensers for handwashing between zones of risk were significant factors in protecting HCWs.",

From the schools, the outbreak quickly spread to the larger community. 34, 37 The community incubation period was relatively long (six to eight weeks) because of the summer vacation. Had school been in session, it is likely that the community incubation period would have been shorter. This is the pattern that developed in Taipei, where a familyeschoolecommunity transmission cascade occurred. Although pandemic H1N1 2009 was largely a disease with mild clinical manifestations, as the total number of sick patients increased, the number of patients who were sick enough to seek medical attention also increased, and intra-hospital transmission occurred.",

The fact that students do not move around the school decreases the opportunity for disease spread, making it less likely that school closure will be necessary. 6 Suspending classes in an effort to slow the time to reach the epidemic peak appears to have been an effective socialdistancing measure during 2009 H1N1, while also enabling schools to remain in session, thereby limiting disruption in the communities.",

For example, Taiwan's approach in the face of H1N1 compares favourably with that of Japan. Whereas in Japan the transmission of pdm H1N1/09 into households may have been minimized by the Japanese government decision to cancel classes, transmission nonetheless continued outside the schools and increased due to the lack of CICs. 45, 46 Interestingly, during the post-pandemic 2010e2011 influenza season, pdm H1N1/09 resurged and accounted for 72.6% of total isolates in Taiwan.

While it is the case that H1N1's mild nature somewhat limits the lessons we can derive, by combining our experiences with the different pandemics in terms of mechanisms of transmission and disease severity, we have an excellent opportunity to develop improved preparedness and disaster response protocols. Lessons from 2009 H1N1 demonstrated that deploying class suspensions and CICs as social distancing measures can delay the pandemic peak while vaccines remain in development. Lessons from both 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 illustrate that Traffic Control Bundling can effectively protect HCWs during a pandemic, and that schools and hospitals are critical control points for pandemic response when the response requires nonpharmaceutical intervention or when it requires vaccination campaigns to engage and mitigate the pandemic.",

The Taipei experience points to the clear benefit of activating either screening stations outside hospitals or CICs. Activating Traffic Control Bundles, at the hospital level and/or at the community level, based on zones of risk, is an additional key step in minimizing the pandemic impact in the interim period between outbreak and vaccine availability, and may be especially useful as a pre-emptive tool in countries with limited public health resources.",

            "text": "A final important lesson is that high vaccination rates among school children and HCWs result in a combined effect that may end the vicious cycle of schoolecommunityehospital transmission. Therefore, to allocate scarce vaccines effectively in the early pandemic stage or during a moderate-tosevere pandemic when vaccine supplies are limited, we recommend that priority be given to achieving herd immunity among school children and HCWs, along with high-risk vulnerable groups. 53 In conclusion, a well-planned, effectively communicated and coordinated emergency response that draws on medical mobilization is the key to a successful strategy for pandemic preparedness and response, and will minimize the health threat of future pandemic influenzas. Whereas this paper focuses on the tools developed to respond effectively to pandemic outbreaks in Taiwan, we argue that these tools may and should be adopted and adapted for use by healthcare officials in other countries too. After all, healthcare officials around the world are faced with similar challenges as they prepare for, and respond to, pandemic occurrences in their own countries. Taiwan provides a rare example of a 'battle-tested' approach to effective pandemic response.",
