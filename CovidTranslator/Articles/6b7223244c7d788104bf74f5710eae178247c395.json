Based on the molecule fingerprint searching method, 11 natural molecules were found in the Traditional Chinese Medicines Database (TCMD). Molecular simulation indicates that the MOL376 (a compound derived from a Chinese medicine herb with the therapeutic efficacy on the human body such as relieving cough, removing the phlegm, and relieving asthma) has not only the highest binding energy with the receptor but also the good match in geometric conformation. It was observed through docking studies that the van der Waals interactions made substantial contributions to the affinity, and that the receptor active pocket was too large for MDL21870 but more suitable for MOL736. Accordingly, MOL736 might possibly become a promising lead compound for CTSL inhibition for SARS therapy.",

It continues to be potential for further zoonotic transmission events, leading to the reintroduction of SARS-CoV into the human population. Previous studies for drug discovery against SARS were mainly targeting on 3C-like proteinase (namely main proteinase, CoV M pro ) of SARS-coronavirus, which is the key step in the transcription and replication of SARS-CoV Chou et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2003; Chou, 2004a) . Anand et al. (2003) suggested that the inhibitor AG7088 of rhinovirus CoV M pro , could serve as a starting point for anti-SARS drug based on the three dimensional structure of the proteinase. Owing to the fitting problem of AG7088 to the binding pocket of SARS CoV M pro , Chou et al. (2003) suggested its derivative KZ7088 as a better starting point. Du et al. (2005) developed a very promising approach to find polypeptide inhibitors against SARS-CoV M pro by searching for the cleavage sites in proteins by the SARS enzyme. So far all efforts in discovering drug against SARS are associated with protease inhibitors targeting on the SARS CoV M pro .",

Their study results are consistent with a model in which SARS-CoV employs a unique three-step procedure in membrane fusion, involving receptor binding and induced conformational changes in S glycoprotein followed by cathepsin L (CTSL) proteolysis and activation of membrane fusion within endosomes.",

The newly identified proteinase CTSL is an important target in drug design for therapeutic intervention of SARS-CoV infection. Because the function of CTSL is in the membrane fusion step, the inhibitors of CTSL may prevent the virus from entering the target cells. Therefore, it may be a better target than SARS-CoV M pro . Eleven Chinese herb compounds are screened from TCMD based on the structure of template MDL28170. Among them MOL736 has the highest similarity and lowest binding energy. The compound MOL736 (chemical name Aurantiamide acetate) is derived from a Chinese medicine herb, Artemisia annua (Zhou et al., 2004) . This plant is known as a herb medicine with many therapeutic efficacies, such as antitracheitis, relieving cough, removing the phlegm, relieving asthma and so on (Sheng et al., 2004) . Therefore, it is a hopeful drug candidate against SARS.",
