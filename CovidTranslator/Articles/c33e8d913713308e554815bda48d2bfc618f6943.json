The resource allocation issues have been explored in theory, by applying the Rybczynski theorem, and empirically, using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for the UK with a detailed health component. From the theory, changes in non-health outputs are shown to depend on factor-bias and scale effects, the net effects generally being indeterminate. From the applied model, a rise in the National Health Service (NHS) budget is shown to yield overall welfare gains, which fall by two-thirds assuming health care-specific factors. A nominally equivalent migration policy yields even higher welfare gains.",

However, many former sceptics of the contribution of health care now accept that, even after allowing for diet and lifestyle, health care does make a difference for specific conditions, such as cardiovascular disease (Wallace, 2004) .

These impose significant costs on society above those of health provision itself. Health care costs themselves are bound to rise given an ageing population and advances in medical technology.",

Those set in a developing country context may be categorised into Basic Needs models (Kouwenaar, 1986; Van der Hoeven, 1987 , 1988 Vianen and Waardenburg, 1975) , Externality models (Savard and Adjovi, 1997) , HIV/AIDS models (Arndt, 2003; Arndt and Lewis, 2000, 2001; Arndt and Wobst, 2002; Dixon et al., 2004; Kambou et al., 1992) and Millennium Development Goal (MDG) models (e.g., Lofgren and Diaz-Bonilla, 2006; Sundberg and Lofgren, 2006) . There are some \"Global\" models, such as Lee and McKibbin's (2003) model of the economic effects of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and most recently Smith et al.'s (2005) UK model of the macro-economic impact of antimicrobial resistance. While each of these strands of CGE literature has its own merits, most do not assess the endogenous impact of changes in health care provision on population health, and on the labour force in particular and its impact on production, income and welfare. 1 Empirical studies typically fail to account for the main feature of all nations' health care systems, namely that they treat and (perhaps partially) cure people, i.e., improve their health, which not only makes them \"feel better\" but also enlarges the effective size of the population through increased working time for some and reduced death rates for all. At the same time, health care systems use factors of production, which reduces their effective supply in the rest of the economy. It is in addressing this caveat that this paper seeks to make a contribution.",

It is the first of its kind in that it has been designed to analyse the macro-economic impacts of changes in health care provision, while recognising the simultaneous effects of changes in health on effective labour supplies and the resource claims made by the health sector. The effects on welfare of higher health provision come through two main channels: (a) the direct gain from increasing the \"well-being\" of the population, and (b) the indirect effects of an increase in the size of the effective (i.e., \"able to work\") endowments of skilled and unskilled labour for use in non-health activities.",

At that level of health provision the numbers of potential workers remaining on the waiting list are S W and U W (and by virtue of the previous assumptions are in the same proportion as the economy's endowment ratio). The inner box then gives the skilled and unskilled labour available to work in the two tradables sectors. Measuring inputs into sector 2 from the north-east corner of this box and inputs into sector 1 from the south-west corner allows us to determine the equilibrium at point A (where the production isoquants of sector 1 and 2, not drawn for simplicity, are tangential, with a slope equal to the absolute value of the relative wage of unskilled to skilled labour). Fig. 2 illustrates the consequences of the government increasing the health budget in the case where there is no change in the overall endowments. Inputs of skilled and unskilled labour in the health sector increase to S * H and U * H respectively. The provision of extra health care reduces the numbers on the waiting lists to S * W and U * W .

It is convenient to decompose these into a \"scale effect\" (increasing the effective endowments of both skilled and unskilled labour due to improved health) and a \"factor-bias\" effect (changing the effective endowment ratio due to differences in skill-intensities between health and non-health sectors). Splitting the changes into the two components allows us to draw some insights from standard trade theory results that have their origin in the seminal paper by Rybczynski (1955) . Since the health sector is, in this example, the most skill-intensive sector, its expansion will lead to a reduction in the skilled-unskilled labour endowment ratio available to the rest of the economy, so that, on the basis of the Rybczynski theorem, the output of the relatively skill-intensive good (sector 1) will fall and the output of the other good (sector 2) will rise. This is the factor-bias effect, depicted in Fig. 2 by the move from A to B. The scale effect, from B to C, shows the effect of reducing the amounts of skilled and unskilled labour on the waiting lists, i.e., increasing effective labour supplies, which in this example increases the production of both goods. 5 In the example of Fig. 2 it is evident that the net effect is a contraction of sector 1 and an expansion of sector 2. However, it will also be evident that in general the effects on the tradables sectors depend on the ordering of factor intensities of the three production sectors and the endowment ratio, on the incidence of illness and on the provision and effectiveness of treatments for the two types of labour. For developed countries the available evidence suggests that the elasticity of effective labour supplies with respect to health care is small (and less than one) so that scale effects are small, as in Fig. 2 . Hence, if we are willing to assume that health care is relatively skill-intensive and that factor-bias effects dominate, we expect an exogenous increase in health expenditures to benefit the unskilled-intensive sector and harm the skilled-intensive sector.",

Another finding, corroborated by other studies (Confederation of British Industry, 2001; Barham and Leonard, 2002) , is that sickness absence varies by socio-economic characteristics. Typically, the higher the wage and the higher the level of responsibility involved in the job, the lower the absence from work. Illness-related absence from work is approximately 1.5 times higher for manual than that for non-manual workers.

The introduction of health care-specific skilled labour and capital in the second experiment provides an alternative specification more suited to the short run. The former type consists of mainly doctors and nurses (approximately 85% of skilled labour employed in health care) and the latter consists of buildings and land (approximately 90% of capital employed in health care), and both earn a health care-specific remuneration. 8 Folland et al. (2001, pp. 108-109) . These elasticities measure the proportionate change in the size of effective endowments of skilled and unskilled labour following a change in the health composite, and are calculated as (\u2202FE hf /\u2202HC f )\u00b7(HC f /FE hf ) = \u03b5 f \u00b7WL hf /FE hf = \u03b5 f \u00b7\u00c1 f /(1 \u2212 \u00c1 f ). The elasticity is higher for unskilled labour due to the fact that a relatively higher proportion of the unskilled suffer illness, so that health expenditure's \"leverage\" is greater for this labour type. Using the same model specification as in experiment 2, experiment 3 considers the alternative policy of importing medical services, i.e., health care-specific skilled workers consisting of doctors and nurses, in order to mitigate the shortage of highly skilled workers in UK health care (the effects of which have modelled in experiment 2). On entering the UK, foreign doctors and nurses are assumed to become part of the existing domestic household structure, i.e., they are perfect substitutes for their domestic equivalents. This assumption takes into account that many of them plan to stay and will thus become permanent UK households in the long-term. Health care-specific skilled wages are maintained at pre-immigration levels so that domestic workers are not worse off in nominal terms as a consequence of the policy. This assumption is representative of the UK situation, given that wages of health workers in the UK are essentially fixed in bilateral bargaining rounds between the Department of Health (constrained by the Treasury) and the medical profession (represented by, among others, the British Medical Association). 9 The experiment uses three alternative assumptions regarding the share of foreign worker income remitted abroad, adopting illustrative values of 0%, 50% and 100% respectively. 10 Varying the share of migrant income remitted will have differential welfare effects since remittances have to be compensated for by a rise in exports and/or a fall in imports so as to maintain the balance of payments. 11 For the purpose of comparability, we carry out the experiments so that they will have identical implications for the nominal government budget on health care (i.e., the NHS budget). In experiment 3, it is assumed that an equivalent of 10% of domestic endowments of health care-specific skilled labour takes up the offer to migrate to the UK, so that the government budget on health care has to rise by 11.31% (approximately \u00a36.09 billion) to maintain their wages at pre-immigration levels in the UK health sector. This budget increase is taken as point of departure for experiments 1 and 2. 12 Table 4 summarises the key results.",

This suggests that, following a rise in the NHS budget and the consequent expansion of the health sector, the increased demand for intermediate inputs from this sector outweighs the reduced availability of skilled labour relative to unskilled labour. Also, most of the unskilled-intensive sectors contract, apart from construction and the medical instruments sector. The latter's expansion is much more pronounced and, as before, is likely to be due to the intermediate demand effect from the health sector, rather than the increased availability of unskilled relative to skilled labour.

Despite the fall in unskilled wages, the increase in labour market participation ensures that all households' income from unskilled (and skilled) labour rises. 9 Health care-specific skilled wages are fixed relative to the num\u00e9raire. Since the consumer price index changes only marginally (by less than 0.02% in absolute terms), fixing health care-specific skilled wages relative to the consumer price index would not alter our results. 10 A reliable estimate of the share of foreign worker income remitted abroad cannot be obtained since the evidence on remittances by migrant workers itself is mixed and difficult to establish for three main reasons: (1) a large proportion of remittances is transferred informally and is therefore not recorded in official statistics; (2) remittance behaviour will depend on the characteristics of the migrants in question, for example, the skill type, income level, length of stay and the country of origin and (3) it is unclear how much of the remittance flows can actually be attributed to health workers. 11 In contrast with the standard neoclassical CGE model closure, in which the current account balance is fixed and assumed equal to the capital balance, the modelling of migration and associated remittances implies that the trade balance has to adjust so as to maintain the balance of payments. Note that our model does not explicitly account for other components of the capital account since it is focused on (the consequences of international trade in services on) the domestic economy. 12 Note that the government closure is such that transfers to households adjust so as to maintain the government balance ceteris paribus changes in government tax revenues so that households bear the brunt of the adjustments. However, in CGE modelling there are many sources of funds that are fungible and an infinite number of distortionary taxes that may be introduced, which all are politically difficult to implement. The main point in CGE modelling and more generally in modern welfare economics is that, as long as overall welfare gains arise, losers may be compensated by winners so that it is possible to undertake a potential Pareto-improving redistribution (Johansson, 1991) . 13 When there are many sectors in a Heckscher-Ohlin model, the Rybczynski Theorem becomes a \"correlation\". As Falvey (1994) states, \"There is a tendency for an increase in those outputs using intensively those factors whose endowments have risen and a decline for others.\" Further uncertainty about outcomes in induced by the existence of intermediate inputs. The UK health sector is relatively skill-intensive, though its skill-intensity is only just above the endowment ratio, so we would expect the \"correlation\" to be low. The fall in government transfers to households, which follows from the assumed balanced government budget, leads to reductions in income for working households with children, but relatively more so for pensioners and non-working households. Only childless working households, who own most of skilled labour endowments and rely least on government transfers, gain slightly.",

This is a direct result of the rather conservative estimates used for the waiting list (and health) elasticities, which we imposed since for the UK as a whole we assume that we are \"on the flat of the health production curve\". If we were to model a specific health care problem and alternative health interventions with a higher marginal return, or if we were to take a different country where the health system is still relatively underdeveloped and the marginal impact of an increase in health provisioning is high, waiting list (and health) elasticities may well be higher, increasing the indirect welfare gains from improved health on effective labour supplies so that total private welfare gains may become positive.

The net effects generally are indeterminate. Given that effective labour supplies are relatively inelastic with respect to health care provision in developed countries since they are \"on the flat of the health production curve\", factor-bias effects may dominate so that an increase in health care provision, which is relatively skill-intensive, may \"on average\" result in an expansion of the relatively unskilled-intensive sectors and a contraction of the relatively skillintensive sectors in the long-term. These predictions were generally not found to hold in the CGE model due to added-real-life complexities, most notably the presence of intermediate inputs. This is a strong argument for the use of an applied model in addition to a theoretical model.",

The main findings are that the increase in the NHS budget, while drawing away resources from its private counterpart and from other non-health related sectors, leads to an overall welfare gain through increased worker incomes and, more importantly, direct increases in population well-being. The presence of health care-specific skilled labour and capital reduces the overall welfare gain by about two thirds, as over half of the specified budget rise is absorbed by higher wages and rents. This suggests the importance of tackling short-term rigidities in the health sector. The shortage of highly skilled workers may in the short-term be addressed via the recruitment of highly skilled foreign doctors and nurses. This policy was found to yield the highest overall welfare gains, even if all foreign worker income is remitted abroad, since government transfers need to fall by less to finance the health care budget increase due to higher government tax revenues. It is, however, unlikely to be a desirable policy given that many migrant workers come from developing countries which need their own educated staff. Consequently, in the long-term increasing the number of medical school places in the UK may be a more suitable policy response.",

In our model these impacts are relatively small since in the UK we assume that at the aggregative level we are on the \"flat of the health production curve\". Interesting applications in this respect are to apply the framework developed in this paper to the perspective of a developing country with a relatively underdeveloped health care system and a high burden of disease (e.g., a country in Sub-Saharan Africa) or to model the impact of an epidemic, such as influenza, and alternative policy options in a developed country context, such as the UK, so as to test the ability of the health system to cope with a disease outbreak.",
