Immediately before inoculation with coronavirus, and approximately every 2 days afterwards, samples of nasal mucus and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken. Nasal mucus was collected using a portable suction apparatus. Nasopharyngeal swabs, blood-, nasal mucus-, trachea-and lung-samples were taken at necropsy. Four calves were inoculated with isolate 81-1184. Two were inoculated with isolate 82-1398 and from 1 of these calves (Calf 6, Table I), the virus was re-isolated in tracheal-organ cultures and used as an inoculum for another calf. Calves were inoculated using a combined intranasal and intratracheal route, twice daily for 4 consecutive days. The morning inoculation consisted of 10 ml of virus given intratracheally and 10 ml intranasaUy. In the afternoon 10 ml of virus were given intranasally.

At necropsy, there was evidence of pneumonia, pericarditis, pleurisy and septicaemia. Histological examination of the lungs revealed exudative bronchopneumonia. No epithelial syncytia or inclusion bodies were seen. Immunofluorescent examination of cryostat sections of lung with an antiserum against bovine enteric coronavirus revealed foci of cells showing cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fig. 1) . Immunofluorescent staining with BVD virus antiserum also revealed the presence of BVD virus antigens in scattered cells throughout the lung parenchyma. No fluorescence was observed when antisera against respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus type 3 were used. BVD virus was isolated from lung specimens in foetal bovine lung cells. Following inoculation of bovine tracheal-organ cultures with lung material, a coronavirus (81-1184) was isolated. This material was treated with antiserum to BVD to eliminate possible contamination with this virus. Salmonella dublin was isolated from the lungs and from other organs. The second .isolate (82-1398) was from the trachea of a 3--4 week old calf, one of a group of 50 Friesian calves, which had been on a calf-rearing unit for 10--14 days. The group history was of inappetance, unthriftiness and coughing. On clinical eXamination, most calves had respiratory rates of 30--40 min-1; a few were moderately tachypnoeic with respiratory rates of 60--70 min -1. Rectal temperatures were normal. Coronavirus antigen was detected by immunofluorescence in \"5 of 6 samples of nasal mucus collected during the visit. Over the next few days an outbreak of diarrhoea involving about 40% of the calves occurred. The situation gradually returned to normal within a week.",

In view of the antigenic similarity between the 2 respiratory coronavirus isolates described here and a bovine enteric coronavirus isolate; it is not clear whether our respiratory isolates are genuine respiratory viruses or are primarily enteric viruses which also grow in the respiratory tract, in a similar fashion to porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Bohl, 1981) .
