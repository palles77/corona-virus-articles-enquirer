The Table describes Background: Many low-and middle-income countries struggle to implement, monitor and evaluate the efficacy of infection control (IC) measures within health care facilities. This hampers their ability to prevent nosocomial infections, identify emerging pathogens and rapidly alert officials to possible outbreaks. The lack of dedicated and trained IC practitioners (ICPs) is a serious deficit in the health care workforce, and is worsened by the lack of institutions that offer IC training. Discussion: While no single individual can entirely eliminate the risk of nosocomial transmission, there is literature to support the value of designated IC persons. Recommendations from the World Health Organization in 2008 and 2009 describe the need for this specialized cadre of workers, but many countries lack the national regulations to authorize, train and manage such professionals at the national or local level. This article provides an overview of how ICPs are trained and credentialed in several countries, and discusses approaches countries can use to train ICPs. Conclusion: Trained ICPs can help prevent future outbreaks and control nosocomial transmission of diseases in health care facilities. For this to occur, supportive national policies, availability of training institutions and local administrative support will be required.",

One key approach is to ensure that IC polices are in place and endorsed at the national level by the ministry of health. Furthermore, it is imperative that national IC laws, policies and guidelines define specific roles and responsibilities of ICPs for both public and private health facilities, and that such standards are enforced. Supporting systems for ICPs include laboratory and data management systems as well as administrative support with the required resources to build and maintain an IC program. A holistic IC strategy includes expanding access to affordable, standardized, evidence-based IC training, such as requiring documented pre-service training and continuing education on IC practices. Increasingly available information and communication technologies can be used to create, disseminate and manage IC-related information, thereby extending IC capacity to the existing health-care workforce. Nurses are the frontline health care workers and the core of the workforce in low-income settings; we thus anticipate that they would be selected for the role of primary ICP. Establishing associations of IC specialists and recognizing the roles and responsibilities of ICPs would also facilitate continuous quality monitoring of IC practices.",

Ceci entrave leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir les infections nosocomiales, \u00e0 identifier les pathog\u00e8nes \u00e9mergents et \u00e0 alerter rapidement les autorit\u00e9s en vue de flamb\u00e9es \u00e9pid\u00e9miques \u00e9ventuelles. La p\u00e9nurie de praticiens d\u00e9di\u00e9s et form\u00e9s \u00e0 la lutte contre les infections (PCI) est une lacune s\u00e9rieuse dans la force de travail et elle est aggrav\u00e9e par le manque d'institutions qui offrent une formation en mati\u00e8re de CI. Discussion : M\u00eame si aucune personne isol\u00e9e ne peut enti\u00e8rement \u00e9liminer le risque de transmission nosocomiale, la litt\u00e9rature est en faveur de l'implication de personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es pour la lutte contre les infections. Les recommandations de l'Organisation Mondiale de la Sant\u00e9 en 2008 et 2009 d\u00e9crivent le besoin de cette cohorte de travailleurs sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s, mais de nombreux pays ne poss\u00e8dent pas les r\u00e8glements nationaux requis pour autoriser, former et g\u00e9rer de tels professionnels au niveau national ou local. Cet article offre une vue d'ensemble de la fa\u00e7on dont les praticiens de la lutte contre les infections sont form\u00e9s et accr\u00e9dit\u00e9s dans plusieurs pays et il discute les approches auxquelles les pays peuvent recourir pour former les PCI. Conclusion : Des PCI peuvent contribuer \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir les futures flamb\u00e9es \u00e9pid\u00e9miques et \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler la transmission nosocomiale des maladies dans les structures de sant\u00e9. Pour aboutir \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat, il est n\u00e9cessaire de mettre en oeuvre des politiques nationales de soutien, et de mettre \u00e0 disposition des institutions de formation et un soutien administratif local.",
