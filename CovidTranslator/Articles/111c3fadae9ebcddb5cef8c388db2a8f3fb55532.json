So far, studies of peptide and protein interactions with membranes have largely been limited to naturally occurring peptides or to sequences designed on the basis of structural information and biophysical parameters. To expand on these studies, utilizing a system with minimal assumptions, we used phage-display technology to identify 12 amino-acid-long peptides that bind to liposomes at pH 5.0 but not at pH 7.5. Of the nineteen peptides discovered three were able to cause leakage of liposome contents. Multivalent presentation of these membrane-active peptides by conjugation onto poly(L-Lysine) enhanced their lytic potential. Secondary structures were analyzed by circular dichroism in aqueous 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and in buffered aqueous solutions, in both the presence and absence of liposomes. Two of the three lytic peptides show alpha helical profiles whereas none of the non-lytic peptides formed stable secondary structures.",

In this study, we achieve the identification of lytic peptides with minimal a priori assumptions. By using a phage-display peptide library screen (18) for peptides with membrane affinity, we circumvent structural or sequence restrictions used in rational peptide design (19, 20) and avoid the limitations imposed by combinatorial chemistry (21) . To test the concept, we have chosen to identify peptides that are lytic in a pHdependent fashion. An understanding of pH-dependent lytic behavior will help us to understand better processes such as endosomal escape of viruses and gene delivery vehicles into the cytoplasm. The knowledge gained by these studies opens the possibility to develop methods in interfering with this step in the infectious pathway of pathological viruses. Furthermore, the insights gained will pave the way to increase endosomal escape of non-viral gene delivery vehicles.",

Lipid concentrations were 25 \u03bcM unless otherwise noted. Final concentrations of stock components for leakage experiments were 1% DMF and 1.2 mM borate respectively. Assays were conducted in 96 well plates (Nunc white polysorb plates, Nalgene Nunc International, Rochester, NY), and calcein fluorescence was followed in a fluorescence plate reader (fmax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 485 nm and 538 nm respectively. Fluorescence was measured in 1 minute intervals with an integration time of 100 msec using SoftMax Pro 1.3.2 software. The reaction time was 30 min at 37\u00b0C, after which complete leakage was determined by the addition of Triton X100 to a final concentration of 0.2%.",

Conformational changes of both class I and class II fusion proteins of enveloped viruses (35) play an essential role in fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. It has been recognized early on that pH-dependent interaction of fusion peptides with lipid bilayers are an important part of merging of membranes (12, 36, 37) . That pH-dependent membrane interactions are also vital in endosomal escape of non-enveloped viruses is demonstrated by the pH-dependent insertion of the capsid protein of rhinoviruses into the endosomal membrane (38) .

Thus, the screen was designed to identify peptides that bind to membranes at pH 5 but not at pH 7.5. Peptides with pH-dependent membrane binding properties were discovered by panning a phage-displayed peptide library against multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) at the two pH conditions. For our screening, the library Ph.D.-12 (NEB, Beverly, MA), which is composed of 2.7 \u00d7 10 9 random combinations of 12 amino acids, was used. The peptides in this library are linked by a GGGS spacer to the Nterminus of the minor coat protein pIII of the filamentous phage M-13. Specifically, the library of filamentous phage was incubated with MLVs at pH 5. Phages that bind stably to MLVs were then isolated by collecting the MLVs by centrifugation; non-binding phages remained in the supernatant. Those phages that did not bind firmly to MLVs at pH 7.5 were selected by eluting phages with pH 7.5 buffer at 37\u00b0C. This eluant was amplified to repeat the panning three more times (see Materials and Methods).",

This amphipathic peptide is a shortened version of the synthetic pH-sensitive peptide GALA (41), which has been described in detail for its membrane activity in vitro (20) . In addition to the relevant amino acid sequences, a cysteine was added to the C-terminus of each peptide (except SFP3, which already has a C-terminal cysteine). Each peptide is named after the screen from which it was recovered. INF7 with the C-terminal Cysteine is now called INF7*.

The other peptides analyzed do not show any activity under these conditions (data not shown). The leakage triggered by INF7* is comparable to the results reported by Plank et al. (28) (Table 3 ). PC4 is almost as active as INF7* while PC2 is approximately 3-fold less active. The leakage activities of SFP3 and PC1 at pH 5 are more than one order of magnitude lower than the activity of INF7* (Table  3 and Fig. 2 ). For certain peptides and pH conditions it was not possible to calculate leakage units because 50% leakage was not reached in the concentration range tested. For two of these conditions, namely PC1 and SFP3 at pH 7.5, leakage was negligible. For the third condition, PC4 at pH 7.5, leakage measured at the highest peptide concentration without detectable peptide aggregation reached 27% (Fig. 2) , approximately 3-fold lower than leakage observed at pH 5.",

Using SPDP chemistry, peptides were coupled to poly (L-Lysine) (pLLys) (Mw = 30\u223c70 kDa) via a disulfide bond from their Cterminal cysteines to modified \u03b5-amino groups of the lysines. With this procedure 16.6+/-1.7% of all lysines were carrying a peptide. Conjugates were then incubated with POPC liposomes in the presence or absence of DTT. In other words, peptides were either released from pLLys by reduction of the disulfide bridge in the presence of DTT, or remained conjugated in the absence of DTT. Analysis in the leakage assay showed that the conjugated form of PC1 was significantly more lytic than the reduced free peptide form (Fig. 3) at both pH 5 and pH 7.5. Despite the same trend, this effect was less pronounced for PC2-pLLys conjugates, and no activity could be observed for PC4-pLLys conjugates (data not shown). The reason for this behavior of PC2 and PC4 is not known at present, but the formation of aggregates might play a role in the case of PC4; PC2, on the other hand, is negatively charged and it is reasonable to assume that the positively charged pLLys may influence its leakage activity by neutralizing these charges and modulating the local pH. Poly (L-Lysine) alone does not result in leakage of calcein from POPC LUVs (data not shown).",

In contrast, tryptophan is highly enriched in the sequence of two of the three active peptides but completely absent from the inactive peptides. Among the active peptides, the sequences are quite distinct in their amino acid composition. The sequence of PC2 is dominated by aliphatics (33% not counting the C-terminal Cysteine) in addition to a partially aliphatic methionine and a phenylalanine. These hydrophobic amino acids and the two acidic glutamates arranged in a periodic manner are features reminiscent of helical viral fusion peptides. PC1, on the other hand, has three titratable amino acids and has 2.8 x higher contents of aromatic amino acids and a 7.4 x higher contents of tryptophan than the parent library. The most intriguing sequence is the sequence of PC4. This peptide displays strongly pH-dependent lytic activity despite the lack of any titratable amino acids. Furthermore, all of its amino acids are overrepresented when compared to the parent library. Strikingly, tryptophan occurs 11.1 x more often than by random chance.",

We therefore analyzed the secondary structure of our peptides by circular dichroism. We first chose TFE as a co-solvent because it serves as a model for the hydrophobic environment of the aliphatic core of membranes. In 50% TFE and in the concentration range tested (50\u223c400 \u03bcM), SFP3 -a peptide designed to maximize its helical content and hydrophobic moment (41) -shows an \u03b1-helical spectra with minima at 208 nm and 222 nm and small contributions from random coil or possibly a 3 10 helix (48) (Fig. 5) . Two of our peptides, PC2, and to a lesser extent PC4 also show profiles consistent with \u03b1-helical conformations. The above structures are present between 25-55\u00b0C (data not shown). The partially helical conformation PC4 suggested by its CD spectrum is surprising given the preponderance of prolines and tryptophans. CD spectra of peptides, however, can be greatly influenced by aromatic amino acids (49) . Hence, it is possible that this apparent partially helical profile is artifactual.

The signal-to-noise ratio could not be optimized to obtain spectra for PC1 and PC4 under the range of conditions tested.

SFP3 showed a similar pH-dependence with peptide alone: deeper 222 nm well minima at pH 5 than at pH 7.5.

The simplest explanation for this behavior lies in the different natures of the liposome-binding assay and the phage screen and calcein leakage assay. In the phage screen, the eluted phages are amplified in each round of screening. Even if only a small amount of bound phage is eluted at pH 7.5, the bulk of the phage remaining bound to MLVs, it will be amplified and thus recovered in the screen.

The parent library's amino acid frequency has been determined previously and was calculated from the sequences of 100 randomly selected phage clones (see Materials and Methods and (39)). The amino acids are ordered according to the residue's propensity of partitioning into either water or liposomal bilayers. This rank order is depicted according to the Wimley-White water/bilayer whole residue hydrophobicity scale (51). Wimley-White obtained this scale by experimentally determining the free energy of transfer (kcal\u00b7mol -1 ) of an amino acid residue from water into a POPC bilayer. Each peptide sequence that was isolated more than once was counted as a distinct peptide for each of the occurrences.",
