Coronaviruses related to mouse hepatitis virus express a hemagglutinin-esterase surface glycoprotein, which specifically hydrolyses either 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu4,5Ac 2 ) or 5-Nacetyl-9-O-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac 2 ). Moreover, these sialic acids represent potential cellular receptor determinants for murine coronaviruses. Until now, the distribution of these sialic acids in mouse brain was not thoroughly investigated. Particularly Neu4,5Ac 2 was not yet found in mouse brain. Using a sensitive method of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in the electron impact mode of ionization this manuscript demonstrates the occurrence of 13 different sialic acids varying in their alkyl and acyl substituents in mouse tissues including 5-N -acetyl-4-O-acetyl-9-O-lactyl-neuraminic acid (Neu4,5Ac 2 9Lt), 5-N -acetyl-9-A.

            "text": "Viral infections are initiated by binding of the virus to cellular receptors. In many instances the virus-receptor recognition is highly specific, conferring species specificity and/or tissue specificity. Coronaviruses, which belong to the order of Nidovirales, infect different animal species. They are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded plus-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kilobases. Their genome is characterized by a 5 -terminal cap structure and a 3 poly A tract. The coronaviridae are divided into the toroviruses and the coronaviruses. The coronavirus genus is divided into three serogroups [1] . Most recently novel human coronaviruses were identified during the search on the etiological agent causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [2] [3] [4] [5] . SARS-CoV is an early split off of group 2 coronaviruses [6] , HCoV-NL63 belongs to group 1 [7] , and CoV-HKU I is a group 2 coronavirus [8] . Mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) belong to group 2, together with rat coronaviruses, puffinosis coronavirus, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV OC43), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV). A major characteristic of group 2 coronaviruses is the presence of a hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) surface glycoprotein in addition to the viral spike protein. It was previously demonstrated [9] that the HE protein of the MHV strain S is a sialate-4-Oacetylesterase, which is able to de-O-acetylate Neu4,5Ac 2 . In addition to this strain, puffinosis coronavirus and sialodacryoadenitis virus exhibit a similar substrate specificity [10] [11] [12] . The HE proteins of group 2 coronaviruses interact either with Neu4,5Ac 2 or sialic acids with O-acetylation at position 9 (Neu5,9Ac 2 ). While human coronaviruses related to the reference strain HCoV OC43 and BCoV specifically interact with Neu5,9Ac 2 via the HE [13, 14] and the spike glycoprotein [15] , the murine coronavirus strains S and JHM recognize Neu4,5Ac 2 [9] and a cellular glycoprotein termed MHV-receptor or CEACAM 1a [16] [17] [18] [19] . For Influenza C viruses and BCoV it was shown that they utilize Neu5,9Ac 2 as receptor determinant, which may be part of glycoproteins or the sialic-acid-containing gangliosides [14, 20] . Although it is known that MHV-like coronaviruses bind and hydrolyse either Neu4,5Ac 2 or Neu5,9Ac 2 [9, 21] , the significance for infections by murine coronaviruses remained unclear.",

Recently, Neu4,5Ac 2 was detected in the colon and trachea of mice, although sialic acids O-acetylated at the glycerol side-chain prevailed [24] . MHV strains exhibit different virulence and tissue tropisms. MHV strains JHM and S represent neurotropic viruses, which cause either chronic demyelinating disease or rapidly fatal infection of the CNS, associated with a virus dissemination to the liver, bowel and other organs [25, 26] . MHV strain A59 produces a mild to moderate meningoencephalitis and chronic demyelination, as well as moderate to severe hepatitis [27, 28] . Enterotropic MHV strains preferentially replicate in the intestinal mucosa [29] . Since different strains of MHV preferentially infect ei-ther the gastrointestinal tract, the liver, the respiratory tract or the CNS, we were aiming to analyse the distribution of O-acetylated sialic acids in all mouse tissues susceptible for infection by MHV.",

It involved, after liberation of sialic acids using mild acid hydrolysis, the formation of methyl esters with diazomethane, followed by the blockage of all free hydroxyl-(amino-) groups with heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride. Subsequent GC/MS analysis of these volatile derivatives allowed, in the electron impact mode of ionization, to identify 38 different sialic acids in samples from different origins. This method was applied to the study of the sialic acids glycosidically bound to glycoproteins and glycolipids from human erythrocyte membranes [31] . It allowed the unambiguous identification and quantification of a large variety of sialic acids including Neu4,5Ac 2 , which was never detected before in human tissues. The same methodology was used to demonstrate an increasing gradient of O-acetylation in the descending human gut [32] . Because of its sensitivity it became possible to analyze the occurrence and distribution of Neu4,5Ac 2 in less than 1 mg of initial total homogenate from different mouse tissues.",

            "text": "Due to methods used in the past, the analysis of O-acetylated sialic acids in glycoconjugates was difficult. The first structural analysis of various sialic acids, especially O-acetylated ones by mass-spectrometry, was reported by Kamerling et al. [35] , using pertrimethylsilyl derivatives of the sialic acid methyl esters. This method significantly contributed to the discovery of a series of previously unknown naturally occurring sialic acids [36] . The GC/MS method used in this report differed essentially from other methodologies using HPLC separation of fluorescent compounds [22, 37, 38] for which the retention time is the major criterion, the coupling with mass spectrometry being difficult. These techniques require an initial purification of the liberated sialic acids, a timeconsuming step performed starting from much higher quantities of initial material (at least 3 orders of magnitude). Furthermore, due to the hydrolysis and isolation procedure, minor quantities of sialic acids may be lost. Even if pooled mice brain were used for the delipidation step (needed for having data on glycoprotein and glycolipid-bound sialic acids), all data presented here were obtained on samples corresponding to 1 mg of initial protein or less. The identity of the different compounds was ascertained by their fragmentation mass spectra and retention times. As previously described, the identification of the different sialic acids was performed using a chromatogram reconstitution for the ion at m/z = 169 specific of HFB derivatives (Figure 2 ). This procedure allowed the elimination of the contaminants like glucose necessarily present in total homogenate samples. The manual integration of the areas of the different peaks allowed a quasi-perfect reproducibility for the major compounds (generally Neu5Ac; less than 0.001% of the reported values) and a good reproducibility for minor compounds (in all cases less than 1% of the reported values). Furthermore, the re-injection of a sample after the first analysis gave the same results within less than 1% error. The second step of identification was performed using chromatogram reconstitution with ions specific of the different classes of sialic acids (m/z = 861 for mono-O-acetylated sialic acids; [30] .",

A characteristic of human gut is its high level of oligo-O-acetylation. In the mouse gut, we could not detect significant amounts of such sialic acid.

Earlier identification of O-acylation in gangliosides was possible by using two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography with an intermediate step of exposure to ammonia vapors [41] . Nevertheless, this method does not allow the identification of the precise nature and position of O-acyl groups. The use of antibodies or lectins specific for 9-O-acetylated sialic acids in gangliosides allowed detection of these compounds [42, 43] . In our analyses of mammalian tissues with the new GC/MS technique, 9-O-lactylated compounds are generally more abundant than 9-O-acetylated sialic acids. This is the case for human [31, 32] , murine (here) and rat brain synaptosomal plasma membranes (Zanetta, unpublished results). The presence of Neu4,5Ac 2 is also a common feature in these three species, although the levels being lower compared to horse tissues [36, 44] . However, as is best illustrated with the high level in the murine gut and the low level in the other mouse tissues, its expression apparently is tissue-specific. Therefore, the enzyme acetyl-CoA: Sialate-4-O-acetyltransferase (E.C. 2.3.1.44) involved in the synthesis of this compound should be present in these species and expressed in different activities e.g. in the various mouse tissues. This enzyme has recently been solubilized from guinea-pig liver Golgi membranes and partially characterized [45] .",

Since the sialic acids were derivatised by diazomethane in the analytical method applied here, a mere chemical origin cannot be excluded. However, this is not very likely since the methyl group is exclusively found at O-8 and the amounts in the various mouse tissues differ, with both glycoproteins and glycolipids of the gut sharing a maximum of almost 13% Neu5Ac8Me. With regard to the finding of Neu (de-N -acetylated Neu5Ac) in most of the mouse tissues analyzed, this again, is possibly not due to an artefact. Neu has been discovered in various mammalian, including human cells like leucocytes, melanoma and neuroblastoma cells [48, 39] . Data on the biosynthesis and regulation of Neu, which is believed to be involved in transmembrane signaling [49] , are scarce. Manzi et al. [50] reported a rapid turnover rate of the N -acetyl groups in the sialic acid moiety of melanoma gangliosides as studied by radioactive labelling experiments. The occurence of Neu5Ac1,7L in sometimes large quantities in the brain and liver is particularly puzzling. This compound was never detected before the initial study [30] , the major reason being that this compound was missed in all analyses involving ion-exchange purification of sialic acids before analysis. Furthermore, it does not react with fluorescent reagents specific for \u03b1-ketocarboxylic acids and enables a sensitive HPLC analysis of sialic acids [37] . This substance is the only sialic acid being identified in the GC/MS analysis when the diazomethane methyl-esterification was omitted. Furthermore, this lactone having a pseudo-dioxane ring, is stable to acidic and alkaline treatments compared with other esters. It can be recovered partially after acid-catalysed methanolysis. The abundance of this compound in the glycolipid fraction of P7 contrasted with its quasi absence in all other glycoprotein and glycolipid fractions, except in liver glycoproteins. In the P7 glycolipids but not in the other tissues studied this abundance is associated with the abundance of Neu, as well as in other tissues with Neu5Ac1,7L occurrence (Tables 1 and 2 ). However, in the corresponding glycoprotein fraction of the same sample, the abundance of the lactone is not associated with the presence of Neu. It is emphasized that Neu5Ac1,7L was found to be the ligand of human IL-4 [51] . Although it is not known whether the murine IL-4 has the same lectin activity as the human one, it may be speculated that gangliosides possessing this type of sialic acid at this specific stage of development may be involved in signalling processes related to cell proliferation or apoptosis.",

In fact, except the presence of Neu5Gc, it resembled that of human tissues in which the same mono-O-acylated compounds are present [31, 32] . For instance Neu5,9Ac 2 , the predominant mono-O-acetylated sialic acid in human gut is also present in the mouse gut, even though in much lower amounts. There are also noticeable differences. Neu5,7Ac 2 could only be detected in very low amounts in the mouse brain but not in the gut. Remarkably, Neu4,5Ac 2 , is present at a high level in the gut, at lower but significant levels in glycoproteins of the liver and in glycoproteins and glycolipids of the brain, two tissues known to be targets of the mouse hepatitis virus strain S. Di-and oligo-O-acetylated sialic acids could not be detected in any kind of mouse tissue tested.",

Several lines of evidence suggest that the presence of CEACAM1 is required for infection by murine coronaviruses. CEACAM1 is a member of the immunoglobulin family, which is involved in intercellular adhesion and angiogenesis. The isoform CEACAM1a is also involved in binding and penetration of murine coronaviruses. The presence of this molecule is apparently essential for infection in vivo: Ceacam1a\u2212/\u2212 mice are resistant to infection by MHV strain A59 [53] . CEACAM1a is a highly glycosylated surface protein [18] , which is present in apical membranes of many epithelial cells [54] . In the case of MHV strain A59, which does not express an HE protein, binding is mediated by the viral spike protein S. The binding site is located at the aminoterminal region of the S protein, which recognizes the first loop of CEACAM1. During biosynthesis and maturation, the S protein is proteolytically hydrolyzed in the Golgi into the subunits S1 and S2, which remain noncovalently linked in mature virions. Binding of the S1 subunit to CEACAM1 results in a conformational change of S1 by generation of alternative disulfide bonds. In consequence, the S1 fragment dissociates from S2, thereby activating the fusion activity of the viral S2 fragment [55] . The binding site on the CEACAM1a molecule is flanked by two N-linked glycans. It was suggested that these glycans may help to delineate the region for the viral spike docking [18] . We have shown in the past that MHV strains S and JHM, which possess an HE protein, bind to Neu4,5Ac 2 , presumably via the spike protein [12] . Most recently, we found that the MHV strain DVIM expresses an HE protein which is specific for Neu5,9Ac 2 [21] . It is currently unknown whether N-glycans of murine CEACAM1a contain O-acetylated sialic acids. If so, the viruses might first bind to the glycans near the docking site on CEACAM1a, which then would direct the viral S1 to the docking site on CAECAM1a. In this case the first interaction between O-acetylated sialic acids and the viral S1 may not be essential in vitro. CEACAM1a, expressed in insect cells, was shown to bind to S1 and to trigger the activation of the S2 fusion domain. Since proteins expressed in Sf9 insect cells do not contain sialic acids, binding of MHV to recombinant CEACAM1a is most likely independent of the presence of Neu4,5Ac 2 or Neu5,9Ac 2 .",

Once HIV has bound to CD4, the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are the major coreceptors, which are required for penetration (for review: [56] [57] [58] ). Compared with the situation observed for HIV, we may speculate that infection by murine coronaviruses involves at least two steps. In general terms the receptor is essential for initial binding, and additional binding to the coreceptor then allows fusion and penetration. A similar situation may exist for MHV: Depending on the virus strain, the primary receptors are either 4-or 9-O-acetylated sialic acids.",

In order to gain entry into target cells, the viruses have then to bind to the specific coreceptor CEACAM1a. In cell culture systems with high expression rates of CEACAM1a the presence of O-acetylated sialic acids for infection by MHV may be not an absolute requirement. In the in vivo situation both the expression of O-acetylated sialic acids at the cell surface as well as the expression of HE proteins and the affinity of the viral S protein to O-acetylated sialic acids most likely determine the organ-and tissue tropism of different MHV strains. In the future it will be interesting to test this hypothesis.",
