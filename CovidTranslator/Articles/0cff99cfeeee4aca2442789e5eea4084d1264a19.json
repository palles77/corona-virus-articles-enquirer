The structures and locations of all proteins in the context of the mature virion are known, with the exception of three ejection proteins. Furthermore, the changes that occur to the proteins residing in the mature virion upon DNA release are not fully understood. We used cryogenic electron microscopy to obtain what is, to our knowledge, the first asymmetric reconstruction of mature bacteriophage P22 after double-stranded DNA has been extruded from the capsid-a state representative of one step during viral infection. Results of icosahedral and asymmetric reconstructions at estimated resolutions of 7.8 and 12.5 \u00c5 resolutions, respectively, are presented. The reconstruction shows tube-like protein density extending from the center of the tail assembly. The portal protein does not revert to the more contracted, procapsid state, but instead maintains an extended and splayed barrel structure. These structural details contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanism of P22 phage infection and also set the foundation for future exploitation serving engineering purposes.",

The double-stranded DNA bacteriophages carry one of three types of tail: long contractile (members of the family Myoviridae), long noncontractile (Siphoviridae), and short noncontractile (Podoviridae). Although the very substantial tail contraction during Myoviridae DNA delivery into the host cell is best understood (2) (3) (4) (5) , the apparently subtler changes in long and short noncontractile tails during this process are less clear (1, 6) . In addition to structural protein rearrangements, DNA ejection is accompanied by the release of a few proteins. These ''ejection proteins'' may prepare the host cytoplasm for DNA arrival (7) (8) (9) or physically aid the transfer of the DNA through the host membranes and/or periplasmic space (10, 11) . In this article, we compare the structures of the short-tailed phage P22 virion before and after DNA release.",

            "text": "P22 is a member of the family Podoviridae that infects Salmonella enterica. Like other tailed phages, P22 virions assemble by first building a protein procapsid, into which the genome is subsequently packaged (12, 13) . The spherical procapsid is composed of six proteins: major capsid protein (gene product 5 or gp5), portal protein (gp1), scaffolding protein (gp8), and three ''ejection proteins'' (gp7, gp16, and gp20). Virion assembly then proceeds when the genome packaging motor complex gp2/gp3 binds to the procapsid (14) . The gp3 subunit recognizes the DNA to be packaged (15) , and gp2 uses ATP hydrolysis as an energy source to insert the DNA into the procapsid at high density (16) . DNA is packaged by a ''headful'' mechanism, and the nuclease domain of gp2 cleaves the packaged DNA from the rest of the concatemeric DNA substrate (17) . DNA packaging also results in rearrangement of the hexons (hexamers of gp5) in the capsid (18, 19) , loss of scaffolding protein (20) , and sequential binding of tail proteins gp4 and gp10 (21, 22) . The mature virion is then completed by the addition of 18 copies of the tailspike protein (gp9) (23) , and the genome is sealed inside the head by the addition of a trimer of gp26 needle proteins that plugs the channel employed by the DNA to enter the procapsid (22, 24) .",

For phages such as P22 that infect Gram-negative hosts, the genome must traverse the outer cell membrane, peptidoglycan layer, periplasmic space, and inner membrane to reach the cytoplasm. DNA delivery by short-tailed phages is poorly understood, and the roles of the ejection proteins remain unclear. Low-resolution tomographic reconstructions of phage T7 virions at various stages of DNA ejection reveal the assembly of an apparent tube that extends away from the virion along the portal axis through the periplasm (10) . This tube may serve as a conduit for delivery of the DNA into the cytoplasm (1,10), and T7 proteins gp14, gp15, and gp16 appear to be involved in this transport, but their specific roles in this process remain unclear (11, 36) . P22 and T7 are very different in the assembly mechanism of tail-and core-associating proteins (37) , and the ejection proteins of the two phages exhibit no sequence homology. One of the ejection proteins of the P22-like phage Sf6 (a P22 gp20 homolog) self-assembles in vitro into tubes that could be involved in transport of the DNA through the periplasm (38) .",

One hypothesis is that the peptide linker between the tailspike protein's particle (capsid) binding domain and its receptor binding domain relays the signal of phage-receptor binding sensed by the tailspike (39) . Another hypothesis is that penetration of the gp26 needle into the outer membrane triggers the release of the ejection proteins and genome (40) . The C-terminal domain of the gp26 needle plugs the phage chromosome's exit channel (40, 41) , and in gp26 deletion mutants, P22 virion assembly and DNA packaging occur normally, but the packaged DNA is unstable and spontaneously leaks out of these particles (41, 42) . The resulting empty particles-which lack gp26 and DNA and are sometimes called ''empty heads''-contain coat protein, portal protein, tailspike protein, and all three ejection proteins (13, 43) . Low-resolution tomographic structures of Escherichia coli phages P1 (2) and T4 (44) , cyanophage Syn5 (45) , and Bacillus subtilis phage \u00f829 (46) bound to their target bacteria have been determined; however, there are no published high-resolution cryo-EM structures of bacteriophages that have ejected their DNA.

Using commands in BSOFT and Chimera (UCSF), an asymmetric model was constructed by computationally enhancing the tail from just one fivefold vertex of the icosahedral reconstruction. Refinement in Auto3DEM proceeded first by limiting the search to the 60 equivalent icosahedral orientations (mode TICOS_equiv) obtained during the symmetric reconstruction to determine which one would agree with the asymmetric model. Subsequent refinement was performed using gold-standard criteria (i.e., the data were split and refined independently until the two maps converged upon a single model). The portal protein density was obtained from the empty particles in a way similar to molecular replacement crystallography (52) ; the proper alignment of the particles to the initial model-which consisted of only capsid and tail-enabled appearance of the portal protein density at the same fivefold vertex. To enhance protein density in the tail and portal regions for visualization purposes, the final asymmetric model was first oriented with the tail aligned to the Z axis. Subsequently, sixfold symmetry was imposed to visualize density in the tail region, and 12-fold symmetry was used to analyze density in the portal region. The local resolutions of the icosahedral and asymmetric reconstructions were analyzed using the e2FSC.py feature in EMAN2 (53) .

Our more recent analyses have shown that the three ejection proteins are all present in the same number of copies (within experimental error) in mature virions and 26 \u00c0 empty heads (Fig. S1 ). Grids with these particles were prepared and examined by cryo-EM. The resulting images revealed particles in various orientations and contained views of both the capsid and tail proteins (Fig. 1) . It was evident that no DNA was present inside the particles, which were marked by the absence of genome density that was observed in reconstructions of mature virions (26) . Unexpectedly, the phages had elongated structure features with a surfboard-like morphology attached to many of their tails. These ''surfboards'' were only observed in gp26 \u00c0 particles (i.e., those lacking the needle); they were not seen in preparations of native virions. Nonetheless, it remains possible that they consist of pieces of bacterial membrane/ peptidoglycan that copurify with the particles.",

A total of 1935 particle images were manually picked using e2boxer (53) , and defocus estimation was performed with CTFFIND4 (54). An icosahedral reconstruction of P22 (55), low-pass-filtered to 50 \u00c5 , was used as an initial model for refinement with Frealign (56). A reconstruction with icosahedral symmetry was determined and refined to 7.8 \u00c5 resolution (0.143 FSC threshold criterion (57)) (Fig. S2) . As expected, this reconstruction reveals a capsid structure in which the gp5 coat proteins adopt the same T \u00bc 7 laevo arrangement as found in mature P22 virions, and prominent secondary structure features of the coat protein were discernible. By imposing icosahedral symmetry in the reconstruction process, densities for the portal vertex and the tail structure are smeared out by a factor of 12-fold with the remaining 11 identical fivefold vertices. To examine differences among the seven coat proteins (A-G) that make up the icosahedral asymmetric unit, an atomic model (PDB: 2XYZ) (18) of the mature virion coat protein was docked as a rigid body into density for each of the seven uniquely positioned subunits using Chimera (58) (Fig. 2) . At this resolution, subunits (Fig. 2 , A-F) do not display detectable differences in monomer shape or intramolecular organization compared to the mature virion. However, density was significantly displaced in the volume corresponding to the spine helix for fivefold proximal G subunits when compared to the mature virion (red arrow in Fig. 2 ). The overall shape of the empty particle is indistinguishable from that of the intact mature virion, indicating that the lack of internal ''DNA pressure'' in the FIGURE 1 Representative cryo-EM micrograph of gp26 \u00c0 empty P22 particles.

An initial asymmetric model was made by isolating the tail density from a single fivefold vertex and appending it to one vertex of the icosahedral-symmetrized model using commands in BSOFT (12) and Chimera (58) . This asymmetric model was initially refined in Auto3DEM (ticos_equiv mode) (59) by probing the 60 orientations equivalent to the ones previously obtained for each particle. Subsequently, Auto3DEM was used also for the goldstandard (57) local refinement procedure. BSOFT scripts were used to orient the asymmetric reconstruction with its tail aligned to the Z axis, followed by imposing either C6 or C12 symmetry to enhance the density associated with the hexameric tail or the dodecameric portal protein, respectively.",

The phage P22 portal protein is known to have different conformations depending on the maturation state of the virus (55), but it remained plausible that the conformation of the portal protein might have an additional change in empty particles since interactions with DNA would be lost upon genome ejection. Could the portal C-terminal barrel invert to extend through the tail and be the protective structure that delivers the genome through the protective barriers of Salmonella? Here, our results demonstrate that the portal structure remains essentially unchanged inside the capsid after DNA release and does not revert to the conformation it adopts in procapsids. It does, however, undergo a conformational change with respect to the conformation observed in mature virions, with the top of the C-terminal barrel appearing to be splayed out in the empty particle. These conformational changes in the fivefold vertex occur in the portal and tail machine.",

            "text": "The asymmetric reconstruction shows a substantial density, not present in virions, that extends away from gp10 at the distal tip of the short tail. This density has a tube shape that narrows and is capped off at its distal end. This density cannot be ascribed to gp26 because these particles have a premature stop at codon 53 in gene 26 (this mutation is a C to T change that creates a TAG codon from CAG; unpublished data). Moreover, SDS gel analysis of gp26 \u00c0 phages show they are null for the gp26 plug and that they contain all three ejection proteins (Fig. S1 ). The density in the reconstruction is also not affected by ''surfboards,'' which appear in less than 10% of the particles. Digital removal of the ''surfboard'' density does not affect the density extruding from the phage tail, suggesting that the extra density is a real structural component of the tail (Fig. S5) . Previous studies have shown that particles lacking the gp26 plug contain ejection proteins associated with them (13) , and since the structures and location of all P22 virion proteins are known in the mature virus except for the three ejection proteins, we believe that this tube-like density is likely to be a remodeled form of one of these proteins (gp16, gp7, or gp20). We hypothesize that this short tube may serve as a precursor assembly in the formation of a longer tube comprised of the other ejection proteins, and the longer tube is used to deliver the virion genome into the host cytoplasm through the outer membrane, peptidoglycan layer, periplasmic space, and inner membrane. Nonhomologous proteins in the short-tailed phage T7 are also thought to form a tube, as evidenced by cryo-EM tomography of virions bound to cells (10, 11, 36) . In our study, the gp26 \u00c0 empty phage particles are not attached to intact bacterial membrane, probably reducing the resolution compared to the T7 study.",

Higher-resolution studies of viral proteins in association with membranes is key to elucidating detailed mechanisms of membrane disruption, which can ultimately be exploited for viral engineering or drug-based inhibition during disease by enabling targeting to specific membranes of different cells.
