            "text": "The eye is unique among organs in that its superficial anatomic location and the transparency of cornea allows for direct and detailed evaluation in the clinical setting. In fact, complete clinical examination of the eye in the living patient will generally provide as much or more information than evaluation at necropsy or gross assessment of an enucleated globe. Even in eyes in which corneal transparency is lost, the superficial location lends itself well to imaging modalities such as ultrasound. The complex terminology of ophthalmic pathology has roots in the terminology of clinical ophthalmology. Historical terms that are anatomically incorrect are widely used in both clinical and pathological settings. For example, \"retinal detachment\" is an acceptable diagnosis denoting the separation of the sensory neuroretina from the retinal pigment epithelium despite the fact that the two structures are part of the retina and are truly apposed rather than attached. The term \"uveitis\" in particular causes confusion between clinicians and pathologists. The histologic diagnosis of uveitis heavily relies on the infiltration of leukocytes in the uveal tract, whereas many of the clinical entities and processes diagnosed as uveitis represent vascular-mediated inflammation. Such clinical lesions can be difficult to evaluate histologically and may go unrecognized. For example, mild fibrin in the aqueous humor of the anterior chamber, easily diagnosed as aqueous flare clinically, may be difficult to appreciate grossly and may not be recognized histologically because the aqueous humor is not typically preserved during sectioning and processing. Furthermore, fibrovascular proliferation secondary to release of vascular mediators within the globe is often considered histologically as a separate event from inflammation with leukocytic infiltration. As such, both clinicians and pathologists must remember that the absence of leukocytes in the globe histologically is not incompatible with a clinical diagnosis of uveitis.",

In carnivores the ocular development continues into the fifth or sixth week after birth. As such, not all developmental errors are congenital, especially in carnivores. Because the globe is not essential for in utero survival, both mild and severe ocular congenital anomalies are encountered in otherwise normal patients. Selective breeding practices have increased the frequency of ocular anomalies. Those that are important or prevalent are discussed in sections dealing with diseases of the specific ocular segment affected. The eye begins very early in gestation as an outgrowth from the primitive neural tube ectoderm, essentially the primitive forebrain. This primary optic vesicle grows outwardly from the brain toward the overlying surface ectoderm, remaining connected to the brain by the optic stalk. As the primary optic vesicle approaches, the overlying ectoderm will focally thicken to form the lens placode. The lens placode thickens, invaginates, and separates from the surface ectoderm migrating inwardly as the lens vesicle to indent the spherical optic vesicle. As the lens vesicle pushes into that optic vesicle, the optic vesicle collapses and invaginates to form a bilayered optic cup. When the lens vesicle separates from the surface ectoderm, that ectoderm re-forms to eventually become corneal exudates or changes in refractive properties related to conditions such as edema and fibrosis are extremely detrimental to visual acuity. Responses intended to save the globe itself can cause loss of function, essentially defeating the purpose of protecting the globe.",

The cilia are largest and most numerous along the margin of the upper eyelid; they may be infrequent or absent along the lower eyelid. The eyelid margin also includes a row of large modified sebaceous glands known as meibomian glands (or tarsal glands).

The innermost layer is the lamina fusca, which contacts the choroid. Blood vessels and peripheral nerves use channels within the sclera to vascularize and innervate to the uveal tract. The scleral venous plexus that provides some of the outflow for the aqueous humor is located in the anterior aspect of the sclera, within the sclera proper.

Epithelium is absent from the posterior surface of the lens. At the lens equator, the epithelial cells are mitotically active and more columnar. The cells migrate inwardly, rotate, and elongate to become lens fibers ( Fig. 21-8) . The lens fibers elongate to reach opposite poles of the lens.

Light passes through the transparent cornea, ocular media, and lens to reach the photoreceptors of the retina.

The electrical signal generated by activation of the photopigment is transmitted in a stepwise manner from the outer nuclear layer to the neurons of the inner nuclear layer, then to the ganglion cells, and finally via the nerve fiber layer to the optic nerve and brain. The number of photoreceptors linked to a single ganglion cell varies greatly among species and is one of the variables determining visual acuity and the efficiency of low-light vision. In all domestic animals except the pig, light not absorbed by the photoreceptors is reflected by the tapetum lucidum to stimulate the photoreceptors a second time.

Minor injuries may cause only erosions, but more severe damage will cause fullthickness loss of epithelium (corneal ulcers). There is immediate osmotic absorption of water from the tear film in the anterior stroma after corneal ulceration, resulting in focal superficial stromal edema. Corneal ulcers imply the exposure of the underlying stroma, which can be detected clinically with the use of water-soluble dyes such as fluorescein. Neutrophils from the tear film will rapidly infiltrate the area to protect the cornea against opportunistic infection and provide growth factors for subsequent wound healing. Small uncomplicated lesions with minimal stromal involvement will heal by sliding and proliferation of the epithelium (see Corneal Wound Healing). ",

Nonspecific chronic keratitis with epidermalization (cutaneous metaplasia) is an adaptive response to mild but persistent corneal injury. These changes inevitably result in loss of corneal transparency; however, the purpose is to maintain corneal integrity and avoid eventual rupture as a consequence of chronic injury. The most common causes of mild chronic irritation are tear film abnormalities and mechanical irritation. Tear film abnormalities that result in desiccation include diseases such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, improper distribution of tears because of abnormal eyelid structure or function, and any condition that prevents the eyelids from closing properly (lagopthalmos). Mechanical irritation may be secondary to eyelid diseases such as entropion or eyelid neoplasia, anomalous distribution/direction of eyelashes (distichiasis and trichiasis), or friction from the nasal skin folds. Unlike acute injuries discussed previously, mild persistent irritation does not cause necrosis. The corneal response to mild chronic injury is a stereotypical pattern of epithelial and stromal changes . The epithelial changes of nonspecific chronic keratitis consist of hyperplasia with rete peg formation, melanosis, and keratinization. The combination of these changes has been termed corneal epidermalization or cutaneous metaplasia because the corneal epithelium acquires features expected with the skin's epidermis. Corneal melanosis results from centripetal migration of limbal melanocytes and melanin accumulation within the corneal basal cells. The stromal changes of nonspecific chronic keratitis consist of superficial neovascularization and fibrosis. There may be infiltration of inflammatory cells, most often lymphocytes and plasma cells. There may also be significant pigmentary incontinence (leakage of melanin from the epithelial basal cells) resulting in superficial stromal melanosis from pigment accumulation in macrophages and fibroblasts. Not all examples of nonspecific chronic keratitis involve the entire range of adaptive changes; it is possible, for example, to have keratinization without melanosis or epithelial changes without accompanying stromal fibrosis and neovascularization. Some of the lesions of nonspecific chronic keratitis are reversible if the underlying cause can be removed, although there may be permanent loss of transparency. Clinically these changes may be recognized simply as \"chronic keratitis\" or \"pigmentary keratitis\" if the changes include melanosis. Nonspecific chronic keratitis that includes melanosis should not be Because the normal stroma is avascular, stromal neovascularization is always considered a pathologic response.

            "text": "The potential causes of corneal neovascularization are wide ranging and include trauma (both accidental and surgical), inflammation, infection, degenerative conditions, and others. Corneal neovascularization is primarily mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in most instances; however, other growth factors may play a role depending on the cause. Following the initiating event, there is a period of latency during which VEGF levels will increase. The latent period lasts approximately 24 hours. This is followed by dilation of limbal blood vessels, which can be recognized clinically and precedes corneal neovascularization. For vascular sprouting to occur there will be multifocal enzymatic digestion of the basement membrane of the limbal vessels accompanied by endothelial cell proliferation. The endothelial cells will then migrate in the direction of the initiating cause, usually dissecting parallel to the corneal stromal lamellae. The growing sprouts become tubes with a lumen followed by adjoining of nearby sprouts to form vascular loops with blood flow. Assuming the initiating cause persists, vessels providing both the afferent and the efferent blood flow will mature into recognizable small arterioles and venules. The process of corneal neovascularization can be interrupted if the initiating cause is removed or controlled. Conversely, the framework of corneal neovascularization may persist for an extended period of time after the initiating cause is removed and blood flow has ceased (\"ghost vessels\"). These remnant vessel walls may become easily engorged with blood with only mild stimulus and in the absence of new vessel formation. Clinically and histologically, corneal neovascularization is generally characterized as superficial, midstromal, or deep. The distribution of the vessels typically corresponds to the origin of the initiating cause (superficial vs. deep). Midstromal neovascularization can be seen secondary to uveitis, even in the absence of any other overt corneal disease. ",

Although some of the principles involved in skin wound healing can be applied to the cornea, there are significant differences. Some differences are mechanistic, but, more important, the desired outcome in corneal wound healing includes transparency. The dermis and corneal stroma are analogous, but the corneal stroma has unique and specialized properties, including the parallel lamellar arrangement of the small-diameter collagen fibrils, the low cell density, lack of blood vessels, and relative dehydrate state (see Box 21-1). These specializations are essential for corneal function and transparency. The requirement for such precise structural organization constrains the corneal stroma to undergo a more deliberate homeostatic remodeling than the dermis of the skin and most other collagenous tissues. Corneal stromal collagen is renewed at unusually slow rates compared to dermal collagen, and keratocytes exhibit slow replication. The cornea is much more resistant to stimuli that would initiate fibrotic repair responses in other tissues. In fact, many mechanisms and adaptations of the cornea aim to provide wound healing by regeneration rather than fibrotic repair in order to maintain transparency. The lack of blood vessels in the corneal stroma also significantly affects the healing process. In skin, platelets derived from the vasculature are a major source of fibrotic repair stimulating and modulating factors. The corneal healing response does not involve platelets, and other cells must provide the cytokines, growth factors, and other substances required. The epithelial response also differs between skin and cornea. Epithelial migration and wound surface closure in the cornea are much more rapid than in the skin. Furthermore, the corneal epithelium produces substances that substitute for those contributed by platelets.",

The corneal epithelium is constantly being renewed by centripetal migration of limbal stem cells to replace the basal cells. The basal cells are mitotically active, and surface maturation ends with apoptotic shedding of the superficial cells. When healthy, the corneal epithelium is completely renewed every 5 to 7 days. Corneal epithelial wound healing is divided into four phases. During the first phase, the latent phase, there is no proliferation or cell migration. Damaged cells undergo apoptosis and are shed in the tear film. There is polymerization of fibronectin over the injury site to form a temporary extracellular matrix scaffold that will facilitate cell movement. The injury will initially result in the arrest of mitotic activity, retraction and hypertrophy of the cells at the margins, and disruption of hemidesmosomal attachments to the basement membrane. The latent phase may last for several hours. The second phase is migration, in which basal epithelial cells at the margins of the defect will slide in a centripetal migration to cover the defect, in part under the influence of Slug, a member of the Snail family of transcription factors. The cells remain attached by desmosomes essentially forming a sheet of cohesive cells that can cover the denuded area. The sliding occurs in the absence of cell proliferation (E- Fig. 21 -5). The corneal epithelial can slide by as much as 1 mm per day. Once the defect is reepithelialized, the third phase of proliferation begins. Mitoses and maturation will resume restoring normal thickness. The fourth phase is attachment and consists of the formation of hemidesmosomes to provide a strong attachment to the basement membrane. If the basement membrane is damaged, repair may occur simultaneously with hemidesmosome formation. Continued alteration may occur until the integrity of the underlying superficial stroma is restored. Corneal ulcers with interruption of the basement membrane may be reepithelialized quickly, but normal function will be delayed until the basement membrane is repaired (weeks) (Fig. 21-14) .",

Proteases, mainly serine proteases and MMPs, are critical to remodeling the stroma.

In those instances, fibrotic repair that maintains corneal integrity is preferable to corneal rupture. Factors that stimulate fibrotic repair include extensive corneal injury, deep or full-thickness corneal injury, infiltration of large numbers of neutrophils, and the presence of infectious organisms (see Fig. 21 -13; E-Figs. 21-6 through 21-10).

Fibrovascular Proliferation and Neovascularization. Fibrovascular proliferation (neovascularization) is often considered separately from uveitis involving infiltration of leukocytes. However, fibrovascular proliferation is part of the inflammatory and healing responses, and many of the forms of uveitis commonly diagnosed by clinicians reflect vascular-mediated processes rather than leukocytic infiltration. Fibrovascular membranes may be present with leukocytic uveitis but also with neoplasms, trauma, and tissue damage associated with hypoxia such as retinal detachment and glaucoma. In fact, fibrovascular membranes are present in approximately 75% of all enucleated canine globes and in 20% to 30% of the enucleated globes in other species. Fibrovascular membranes develop when the balance of angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors favors neovascularization. Of the many cytokines that contribute to fibrovascular proliferation, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most significant. Fibrovascular membranes include newly formed vessels, spindle cells compatible with fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, and collagenous extracellular matrix. The contribution of each component to fibrovascular membranes depends in part on cause and chronicity. Fibrovascular membranes are often described by their distribution: retrocorneal, preiridal, posterior iridal, cyclitic, and intravitreal. Retrocorneal membranes line the posterior aspect of the cornea, often effacing the corneal endothelium. Preiridal membranes are the most common form of fibrovascular proliferation in the eye . These fibrovascular membranes line the anterior aspect of the iris. The membranes arise from budding and migration of capillaries from the iris stroma and recruitment of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, similar to a healing response in other organs. Contraction of preiridal fibrovascular membranes can cause distortion of the iris, most often retraction of the pupillary margin of the iris, either anteriorly (ectropion uveae) or posteriorly (entropion uveae). Preiridal fibrovascular membranes may be continuous with retrocorneal membranes or extend posteriorly. Posterior iridal membranes cover the posterior iris epithelium and may extend to cover the ciliary body. Cyclitic membranes extend from the ciliary epithelium along the anterior vitreous face and may extend to carpet the posterior lens capsule.",

Hemolysis may be more important than phagocytosis by macrophages for clearance of vitreal hemorrhage. Some red blood cells will persist for months within the vitreous. These cells must possess a metabolism allowing survival in the altered vitreous and escape phagocytosis by macrophages. These intact cells may be fresh red blood cells that lack the opsonins recognized by macrophages on older red blood cells targeted for phagocytosis.

The number of macrophages that respond to vitreal hemorrhage is significantly less than that in other organs. Some of the macrophages in the vitreous appear metabolically inert and will undergo cytolysis with phagocytosis by other cells. The measured response is a consequence of reduced chemotactic stimulation, including the lack of fibrin degradation products, and the vitreal properties of hyaluronate that impedes migration and inhibits phagocytosis. The purpose of this measured response may be to maintain ocular immune privilege and ocular function by avoiding a marked response leading to granulation tissue formation.

Despite the long list of potentially injurious stimuli and the innumerable routes by which such stimuli can impact the retina, retinal disease is overall infrequent. The vast majority of retinal lesions fall into the following four categories: 1. Destruction of the neural elements of the inner retina (nerve fiber layer, ganglion cells, and inner nuclear layer) as a result of increased intraocular pressure (see Glaucoma). The pathogenesis of the inner retinal destruction and destruction of the optic nerve remain a source of great controversy, and it probably varies among species and with the type of glaucoma (see Glaucoma). 2. Retinal detachment is a common consequence of inflammatory, infectious, and vascular disease. The photoreceptors are therefore likely to become necrotic from ischemia and malnutrition metastatic neoplasia, and, less frequently, toxins. Injury to the blood vessels themselves from thrombosis or occlusion by neoplastic emboli may cause ischemic damage. Traumatic injury may be the result of penetration or blunt force. Penetrating injury may cause direct injury or provide infectious agents entry into the globe and uveal tract. Blunt trauma may result in separation of the uveal tract from the sclera leading to traumatic angle recession or cyclodialysis. Blunt trauma may also damage blood vessels, causing hemorrhage. Corneal and scleral disease may extend to involve the uveal tract. Furthermore, chemical mediators of inflammation released from injured cornea, lens, or retina diffuse through the aqueous humor or vitreous, or directly in the uveal tract eliciting uveal damage as part of the inflammatory response.",

            "text": "Retinal atrophy (degeneration) is the most important secondary change in glaucoma. It is important because it causes blindness as a result of damage to the ganglion cells, which cannot regenerate, even if the intraocular pressure returns to normal levels. The degeneration characteristically causes atrophy of the nerve fiber layer and loss of ganglion cells (Fig. 21-23; E-Fig. 21-28 ). In dogs, there can be later loss of neurons from the inner nuclear layer. The M\u00fcller glial cells remain intact, although some functions may be altered. In glaucomatous retinal atrophy, the outer nuclear layer and photoreceptors can remain unaffected for extended periods of time. This pattern of \"inner retinal atrophy\" with sparing of the outer nuclear layer and photoreceptors is characteristic of glaucoma. Other forms of retinopathy, including inherited, nutritional, and toxic forms, target photoreceptors rather than the inner retina. In some instances, the outer retina may be damaged as part of glaucoma. Acute, severe increases in intraocular pressure can lead to necrosis and apoptosis of photoreceptors, likely as a response to pressure-induced collapse of the superficial choroidal blood vessels and ischemia. In dogs, chronic glaucoma can lead to full-thickness atrophy. In globes with glaucomatous inner retinal atrophy, the retinal degeneration may be more severe ventrally. This is termed \"tapetal sparing\" but can also be observed in atapetal globes. Tapetal sparing is most common and dramatic in dogs but can be seen in any species. correlates with the extent to which the iridocorneal angle circumference is involved, which must be evaluated clinically. Goniodysgenesis is invariably bilateral but not necessarily symmetric. The robust pectinate ligaments of horses and ruminants, and to a lesser extent pigs, should not be confused with pectinate ligament dysplasia/goniodysgenesis (see Fig. 21-7) .",

With chronic goniodysgenesis-related glaucoma, there is complete collapse of the iridocorneal angle including required for long-term survival and function of retinal ganglion cells. Excitotoxicity: Damaged ganglion cells release excitatory compounds, primarily the neurotransmitter glutamate, which then induces apoptosis of previously uninjured ganglion cells. This can lead to a self-perpetuating cycle of neuronal cell death from excitotoxicity. Retinal injury is unlikely to result in massive glutamate release as the case with acute brain injury. Glutamate excess is more likely to only occur in microenvironments representing areas of localized retinal degeneration. Retinal glutamate receptors are located in the outer plexiform layer where glutaminergic synapses connect photoreceptors to bipolar and horizontal cells and in the inner plexiform layer that contains most of the glutaminergic synapses between retinal ganglion cells and bipolar and amacrine cells. Excitotoxic damage occurs when excess glutamate binds to ionotropic glutamate receptors triggering massive calcium influx and activation of proapoptotic pathways. Excitotoxic damage overrides the protective effect of endogenous and exogenous neurotrophic factors. Glial cells that maintain physiologic levels of glutamate are responsible for the uptake of excess glutamate via glutamate/aspartate transporters. As such, deficits in transporter function can contribute to retinal ganglion cell damage. Furthermore, excess glutamate may cause glial cells to exacerbate ganglion cell loss by releasing neurotoxic factors such tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, nitric oxide, and \u03b1 2 -macromodulin.",

Eosinophilic conjunctivitis is the conjunctival counterpart of the eosinophilic keratitis syndrome seen in cats and occasionally in horses (see Disorders of Cats). Rarely, there may be conjunctivitis in the absence of keratitis. Lesions may be unilateral or bilateral. Although eosinophils are required for the diagnosis, the proportion of eosinophils within the inflammatory infiltrate varies greatly between cases. Ulceration is common in severe cases. In chronic cases, especially those in which antiinflammatory medication was used, inflammation is likely to be predominantly lymphoplasmacytic with a scattering of eosinophils. In any species, eosinophils may be present with allergic/hypersensitivity disease and parasitic disease. Solar-Associated Lesions. As in the skin, chronic ultraviolet exposure results in degenerative lesions in the conjunctiva (see Chapter 17). Factors that contribute to the development of solarassociated lesions include high altitudes, low latitudes, lightly pigmented conjunctiva, and long duration of exposure. The lesions include solar elastosis, solar fibrosis, and solar vasculopathy (Fig.  21-30) . The most common and most easily recognizable change consists of solar elastosis. Solar elastosis develops in the superficial substantia propria and is recognized as thick, basophilic, and irregularly aligned fibers. These fibers are visible with standard hematoxylin and eosin staining and do not require special staining for elastin fibers. The fibers of solar elastosis represent mostly newly produced material rather than degeneration of preexisting fibers. The lesions are usually mild in dogs but can form plaques in horses and cattle. Solar fibrosis describes a band of hypocellular, sclerotic altered collagen located immediately underlying the epithelium. Solar fibrosis is not true fibrosis. Solar vasculopathy is uncommonly seen in the ridges that are visible in longitudinal section, whereas Dirofilaria spp. have longitudinal ridges that are visible in cross sections ( Fig.  21-29 ). In horses, the ocular lesions are caused by Onchocerca cervicalis and it is the microfilariae that cause the lesions, not the adult worms. In addition to conjunctivitis, there may be keratitis and uveitis.",

Because the lens protein is sequestered from the immune system during embryologic development, the release of large amounts of strongly antigenic lens protein into the aqueous humor essentially elicits a foreign body reaction type of response. The histologic lesion is a lens-centric granulomatous endophthalmitis. Phacoclastic uveitis is also seen in dogs that have rapidly progressing diabetic cataracts; however, in those instances, the refer to abnormal persistence of portions of the perilenticular vascular tunic or the vascular network within the developing vitreous. Such anomalies are common in dogs. The embryonic lens is encased in a network of blood vessels known as the tunica vasculosa lentis (E- Fig. 21-46 ). This network is created by contributions from the same mesenchyme that forms the iris stroma and from vasogenic mesenchyme growing into the developing vitreous through the posterior portion of the slowly closing optic fissure. The latter vessels, growing in from near the optic disc, are the hyaloid artery system. Together with other nonangiogenic mesenchymal elements, these vessels form the primary vitreous. This embryonic hyaloid artery system creates a temporary vascular network along the surface of the developing retina and also joins with the anterior chamber vessels to complete the tunica vasculosa lentis. All portions of this elaborate vascular system undergo atrophy before maturation of the globe. Persistence of one or more portions is common. The most common is persistence of the anterior portion of the tunica vasculosa lentis. This is usually referred to as persistent pupillary membrane. Macroscopically, these are seen as fine threads originating from the minor arterial circle of the iris (Fig. 21-39 ; E- Fig. 21-47 ). They are usually bloodless but are often pigmented. They may be inserted into the anterior stroma of the iris, or they may contact the surface of the anterior lens capsule. Occasionally, in what is probably a more significant anomaly, they insert into the cornea. These membranes become clinically significant if they contact the lens or cornea, where they interfere with proper development of corneal or lens epithelium, or their associated basement membranes (Descemet's membrane and lens capsule, respectively). Histologically, persistent pupillary membranes are thin endothelial tubes accompanied by varying amounts of mesenchymal stroma (E- Fig. 21-48) . At sites of corneal contact, they may cause fibrous metaplasia of the corneal endothelium. Where they contact the lens, there is usually epithelial proliferation and dysplasia of the lens capsule, resulting in a focal cataract.",

They are either free or within the cytoplasm of macrophages and have the typical features of Blastomyces spp.: thick-walled spherical yeasts, 8 to 25 \u00b5m in diameter, with occasional broad-based budding. Some cases may have a predominance of dead organisms where only the thick empty capsule is recognized. The diagnosis can often be made by cytologic evaluation of subretinal exudates, most often performed in eyes that are already blind because of retinal detachment. Other lesions in affected globes are those seen in any severe uveitis: intraocular hemorrhage, posterior synechia, preiridal fibrovascular membrane, and cataract.",

Only 6% of uveal melanocytomas principally affect the choroid. Melanocytomas of the anterior uvea readily efface the iridocorneal angle. Many will expand along the corneoscleral meshwork, which extends anterior to the termination of Descemet's membrane and blends with the deep peripheral corneal stroma. Scleral extension is common for both anterior uveal and choroidal melanocytomas and is not a feature that is indicative of malignancy ( Fig. 21-42; E-Fig. 21-53 and 21-54) . All melanocytomas have a similar histologic appearance independent of their origin in the iris, ciliary body, or choroid. The neoplasms are composed of variable proportions of heavily pigmented spindle cells and discohesive heavily pigmented plump polyhedral cells. Uveal malignant melanoma is more common in the anterior uvea than in the choroid. Only 3% of uveal malignant melanomas are choroidal in origin. Approximately 25% of anterior uveal melanocytic neoplasms and 15% of choroidal melanocytic neoplasms are malignant. The mitotic index is the most reliable parameter in the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. A threshold of 4 mitoses in 10 high-power fields (HPF) is most widely used to establish malignancy in uveal melanocytic neoplasms (Fig. 21-43) . As with uveal melanocytomas, expansion along the corneoscleral meshwork, in the sclera, and in extrascleral tissues is common. Malignant melanomas are less pigmented than their benign counterpart and can be amelanotic. Neoplastic cells containing pigment should not be assumed to be melanocytes because any disruption of the uveal tract can result in pigment dispersion and phagocytosis by neoplastic cells. For any uveal melanocytic neoplasm, necrosis and infiltration of melanophages is common. Choroidal involvement often causes retinal detachment. predominant or presenting clinical complaint. In dogs, the disease is endemic in the Mediterranean basin as well as areas of Africa, India, and Central and South America. The disease is less commonly seen in cats, mainly in Europe and South America. Although uncommon, there are reports of both canine and feline leishmaniasis in North America. The ocular infection most frequently causes granulomatous nodular conjunctivitis and uveitis; however, the infection may be present in any of the ocular components or periocular tissues. Amastigotes measuring 3 to 5 \u00b5m long and 1 to 2 \u00b5m wide are found in macrophages.",

In addition to their direct effect on ocular function, neoplasms are commonly associated with secondary changes such as dyscoria, hemorrhage, fibrovascular proliferation, lens luxation, cataract, asteroid hyalosis, and retinal detachment, and they are a frequent cause of secondary of iris hyperpigmentation. These areas histologically correspond to preneoplastic iris melanosis characterized by one to five layers of well-differentiated heavily pigmented melanocytes that cover the anterior surface of the iris. Iris melanosis may remain stagnant for years or slowly progress by increasing the number and/or size of the foci. Once the melanocytes extend in the underlying iris stroma, it is considered FDIM. The progression of FDIM is highly variable. Some cases can progress slowly over years without clinical signs, whereas others develop rapidly, causing glaucoma and spread to other organs. Almost all instances of FDIM follow a similar progression, albeit at different rates ( Fig. 21-45; E-Fig. 21-55) . The lesion begins as iris melanosis and then infiltrates and expands the iris stroma, followed by extension in the ciliary body (Fig. 21-46; E-Fig.  21-56) . The lesion then extends in the sclera and/or choroid, and some neoplasms infiltrate the scleral venous plexus. Rare cases infiltrate beyond the sclera into the conjunctiva or orbit. Despite this reproducible pattern of growth, the rapidity with which FDIM progresses is unpredictable. As such, there are no definitive criteria to I Ocular Melanosis. Ocular melanosis (pigmentary glaucoma) is a unique condition that must be distinguished from uveal melanocytomas and malignant melanomas in dogs. It is unclear if ocular melanosis is truly neoplastic. It is seen most often, but not exclusively, in Cairn terriers. In that breed, pedigree analysis suggests the trait has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The melanocytes in ocular melanosis have a unique immunophenotype that differs from normal melanocytes with negative staining for Melan-A and S-100. Grossly, ocular melanosis appears as diffuse pigmentation of the uveal tract. Pigment may be visible through the sclera. Histologically, it is characterized by diffuse uveal infiltration of large plump pigment-laden cells without formation of a distinct mass (Fig.  21-44) . Both melanocytes and melanophages contribute to the uveal expansion. There may also be extension along the optic meninges. The condition is bilateral in Cairn terriers. In other breeds, it is usually unilateral at presentation, but it may eventually affect the contralateral globe. low. In cats, many neoplasms are predominantly composed of elongated cells in sheets, and some contain metaplastic bone; these neoplasms are often misdiagnosed as sarcomas.

Lymphoma is the most common secondary neoplasms in all species, but it is particularly prevalent in cats. There are two general patterns of metastasis to the globe. Leukocytic neoplasms such as lymphoma and histiocytic sarcoma will typically cause diffuse expansion and effacement of the uveal tract ( Fig. 21-47 ). Carcinomas and nonleukocytic sarcomas more often will form multifocal masses. Some will carpet the iris and ciliary body and occlude blood vessels. Mammary adenocarcinomas and pulmonary adenocarcinomas are the most common guide veterinarians as to the best time to enucleate. However, there is general agreement that globes with progressing pigmentation compatible with FDIM that develop glaucoma should be enucleated. Histologically, FDIM is composed of neoplastic melanocytes that may be predominantly spindle, polygonal, or round. The amount of pigmentation varies greatly, but very few are amelanotic. Although not prognostically significant, neoplastic cells often exhibit significant pleomorphism with karyomegaly and multinucleated cells. Intranuclear cytoplasmic invaginations may also be a prominent finding. The histologic features that have some prognostic value include extent of the tumor, vascular invasion, mitotic index, and the volume of necrosis within the tumor. FDIM limited to the iris typically does not cause glaucoma, and removal at that time is associated with survival times similar to those of unaffected cats with no risk of metastasis. FDIM with extension in the ciliary body and beyond is more likely to develop glaucoma and more likely to metastasize, especially with extrascleral extension. Vascular invasion typically occurs in the scleral venous plexus and is usually associated with advanced or extensive lesions. A high mitotic index is a poor prognostic indicator, and a threshold of 7 mitoses in 10 400\u00d7 fields may be used as a guideline. The liver and lungs are the most frequent sites of metastasis. Metastases tend to develop slowly and in some cases may not be recognized for 1 to 3 years after enucleation. FDIM must be differentiated from the much less frequent feline atypical melanoma. Feline atypical melanoma forms multinodular masses in the uveal tract rather than diffuse expansion of the iris. It is composed of well-differentiated, heavily pigmented melanocytes with minimal pleomorphism and a low mitotic index. However, despite these features typically associated with a benign process, feline atypical melanoma may metastasize.",

After being diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, approximately half of the dogs will develop cataracts within 6 months and 80% within 16 months. Controlling the hyperglycemia and, by extension, the levels of glucose in the aqueous humor can delay the development of cataracts. Once the lesion develops, progression to complete cortical opacity and thus visual impairment usually occurs within days to weeks. The swelling may be so rapid that the lens capsule ruptures. The cataract develops because of high levels of glucose within the aqueous humor. When the hexokinase pathway is overloaded with glucose, the excess glucose absorbed by the lens is shifted to the sorbitol pathway, where it is transformed by the enzyme aldose reductase into sorbitol. This leads to accumulation of sorbitol, which creates a hyperosmotic effect, and the influx of fluid. The result is rapid swelling of the lens and disruption of its architecture. The osmotic stress also induces apoptosis of lens epithelial cells. The histologic features of the cataract itself are similar to those of any other severe cataract, making clinical history critical to the diagnosis. Some cases develop severe granulomatous endophthalmitis (phacoclastic uveitis) that tends to carpet the uveal tract rather than be centered on the lens. This form of inflammation associated with diabetic cataracts must be differentiated from asymmetric uveitis (see Disorders of Dogs). Rarely, diabetic cats can also develop cataracts, but the lesion is less severe than in dogs and appears to have limited clinical significance. Older cats have lower aldose reductase activity than dogs and young cats, which may provide protection by limiting the production of sorbitol.",

The condition is almost exclusive to the cat, although a few cases have been described in rabbits. The initiating event is presumed to be ocular trauma or severe ocular disease. The neoplasms are recognized following a period of dormancy typically lasting multiple years following the initiating event (average 5 years). Morphologically, the neoplasm is a sarcoma and expresses vimentin. The neoplasm is believed to arise from malignant transformation of the lens epithelial cells. Some neoplasms are immunopositive for the lens structural protein crystallin \u03b1A, and lens capsule rupture is recognized in almost all cases. Neoplasms are initially centered on the lens, and neoplastic cells multifocally deposit lens capsule/basement membrane-type material that stains with PAS and is collagen type IV immunopositive. To a lesser extent, immunoreactivity to smooth muscle actin (SMA) is also consistent with lens origin because lens epithelial cells can express SMA especially in diseased states such as cataracts. Similarly, the occasional immunoreactivity to cytokeratin may reflect the origin of the lens epithelium from the surface ectoderm; cytokeratin expression is normally lost during embryogenesis.",

The inflammation most often includes the formation of lymphoid follicles that become increasingly organized with chronicity (E- Fig. 21-68) . During periods of quiescence, the lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate is milder and predominantly perivascular. Many of the diagnostic changes involve the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium. Lymphocytes and/or plasma cells infiltrate the Histologically, the masses are variably encapsulated and composed of lobules of often vacuolated cells that show mild pleomorphism and minimal mitotic activity. Ultrastructurally, the neoplastic cells have fairly distinct basal laminae, and the cytoplasm contains numerous mitochondria and lipid droplets. The main differential diagnosis is well-differentiated liposarcoma, and distinction may not always be possible without history, especially in incisional samples.

            "text": "Fungal keratitis (keratomycosis) occurs frequently in horses and is reported mostly during warmer weather and in warm, humid climates. Similar infections occur much less frequently in dogs, cats, and other species. It is suspected that the use of topical antibiotics is a predisposing factor for fungal keratitis as the result of changes in the normal bacterial microflora with decreasing numbers of Gram-positive organisms and increasing numbers of Gram-negative bacteria. The normally predominant Gram-positive bacteria produce antimicrobial substances including the antifungal natamycin. Topical administration of corticosteroids may also be a predisposing factor, and it can exacerbate the effect of proteases and impair corneal healing. The pathogenesis involves disruption of the corneal epithelium secondary to erosion, ulceration, or penetrating trauma. The epithelial injury allows fungal organisms from the environment or those from the normal microflora to anchor, colonize, and invade. The release of proteases by the organisms and by inflammatory cells contributes to stromal injury and provides access to the deep cornea. Some fungal organisms also produce metabolites that inhibit angiogenesis, altering the cornea's healing response. Aspergillus spp. are the most common agents isolated. Fusarium spp. and others also cause fungal keratitis. Fungal keratitis typically elicits a suppurative response with keratomalacia (see Fig. 21-38) . The inflammation may be superficial but there is most often involvement of the deep stroma, and many fungal organisms show a tropism for the deep stroma and Descemet's membrane (Fig. 21-54; E-Fig. 21-67) . These organisms may have an affinity for glycoaminoglycans that are abundant in those areas. Inflammation that is predominantly deep can form a stromal abscess, which may protrude in the anterior chamber. Untreated or unresponsive cases can progress to corneal rupture. Despite extension to and involvement of Descemet's membrane that essentially provides access to the anterior chamber, fungal keratitis does not progress to endophthalmitis in the absence of corneal rupture. Many of the details of the pathogenesis have not yet been elucidated; however, ERU is generally regarded as a multifactorial immune-mediated disease. The majority of the infiltrating cells are CD4 + T lymphocytes and include helper T lymphocytes that secrete IL-2 and interferon-\u03b3. There is also secretion of IL-17 likely by helper T lymphocytes 17, indicating a role for autoimmunity. Many cases of ERU show immune responses to ocular proteins, most often retinal antigens such as interphotoreceptor-binding protein, S-antigen, and cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein. Some horses develop lymphocytic inflammation in the pineal gland, which shares antigens with the retina, including the S-antigen. Furthermore, the disease is associated with specific equine major histocompatibility complex haplotypes.",

Antibodies against Leptospira spp. cross-react with the equine cornea, lens, ciliary body, and retina, suggesting that molecular mimicry contributes to the pathogenesis of the ERU.

The vast majority of cases are thought to be initiated by penetrating trauma to one globe. The lesion consists of granulomatous to pyogranulomatous endophthalmitis where the leukocytes carpet the uveal tract, posterior cornea, and/or inner retina ( Fig.  21-60) . Retinal detachment and necrosis are common. Usually within weeks, the contralateral globe will develop inflammation with similar distribution and composition without trauma. However, it is not possible to accurately predict if or when the contralateral globe will be affected. Clinicians should be made aware of this risk so that the contralateral globe can be closely monitored and early treatment can be administered. The pathogenesis has not been elucidated in dogs, but asymmetric uveitis may represent a T lymphocyte-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction targeting a uveal antigen. Clinical information is often required to differentiate asymmetric uveitis from phacoclastic uveitis associated with diabetic cataracts. Unlike uveodermatologic syndrome, in Multinucleated giant cells and eosinophils are occasionally admixed with infiltrate. Distinct granulomas are not a feature of the condition. It is likely that the histologic lesion represents a reaction to different stimuli rather than a specific disease.

The virus causes epithelial cell cytolysis, which can predispose to secondary bacterial infection. The conjunctivitis can also lead to symblepharon, adhesions between the cornea and conjunctiva. Intranuclear inclusion bodies are present only during the early stages of the disease and are therefore almost never seen histologically. After recovery, most kittens develop latent infection primarily in the trigeminal ganglia. FHV-1 is the most commonly clinically diagnosed cause of keratitis in cats, presumed to represent recrudescent disease in most adult cases. However, the causative effect of FHV-1 is difficult to document in clinical cases. Proving FHV-1 as the cause of keratoconjunctivitis is problematic because greater than 95% of cats show serologic evidence of exposure and up to 50% of clinically normal cats contain FHV-1 DNA in the cornea. Clinically, the disease may present as ulcers, either dendritic ulcers considered pathognomonic for the disease or geographic ulcers. FHV-1 can also cause a chronic stromal keratitis with nonspecific infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Based largely on the presence of viral DNA, some have also proposed a role for FHV-1 in feline corneal sequestrum and feline eosinophilic keratoconjunctivitis. Herpesvirus keratoconjunctivitis is essentially a clinical diagnosis, and affected corneas are unlikely to be examined by a pathologist. Samples that are examined histologically do not show intranuclear inclusions, nor do they demonstrate changes that can be specifically attributed to the cytopathic effect of the virus. It is therefore not possible to confirm FHV-1 infection histologically.",

Unlike other domestic animals, cats have only limited capacity to synthesize taurine from the precursor amino acid cysteine because of low levels of the enzyme cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase. Cats depend on dietary intake to maintain normal tissue concentrations. All ocular components contain taurine, but the concentrations are highest in the retina and even more so in the photoreceptors. Taurine plays a critical role in normal development and function of the retina and also of the visual cortex of the brain. The exact functions of taurine are not clearly defined, but it does provide cytoprotection through its antioxidant properties and also modulates neuronal activity in a neurotransmitter-like manner. In taurine-deficient cats, the earliest lesions consist of cone disorganization. Cones are more sensitive than rods to taurine deficiency, and the rods of the peripheral retina are the last to degenerate. Initially, the histologic lesion is photoreceptor degeneration in the area centralis that progresses to more widely affect the retina dorsal to the optic nerve.

The inflammation may also extend in the optic nerve and/ or optic meninges. In enucleated globes from patients that do not manifest overt systemic signs and present for chronic unresponsive uveitis, the inflammation tends to be plasma cell predominant. Although the changes in the globe are often highly suspicious for FIP, an absolute definitive diagnosis is rarely possible based on ocular histopathology alone.",

One is an early onset rod-cone dysplasia with clinical signs of slower pupillary light reflexes, mydriasis, and nystagmus developing as early as 4 to 6 weeks of age. It has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and is the result of a single base deletion in the CRX gene. Both cones and rods show abnormal and retarded development. The photoreceptor degeneration begins in the central retina and progresses toward the periphery. Cones are more severely affected than rods. By 1 year of age, the disease is advanced and cats are blind. In contrast, the lateonset retinal degeneration is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, and affected cats usually show no clinical signs until approximately 2 years of age. There is variable progression to full-thickness retinal atrophy over 2 to 4 years. Rods are more severely affected than cones. The earliest histologic lesions are disorganization of the ",
