It is necessary to detect ZIKV with a rapid and sensitive molecular method to guide timely treatment. In this study, a loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was described, which is an attractive option as a fast, sensitive, and specific method for ZIKV detection using the NS5 protein coding region and the envelope protein (EP) coding region as target sequences. Two different techniques, a calcein/Mn 2+ complex chromogenic method and real-time turbidity monitoring, were employed. The specificity and sensitivity of the LAMP assay were determined. The assay's detection limit was 0.5 \u00d7 10 \u22129 pmol/\u00b5l DNA for NS5 protein coding region and 1.12 \u00d7 10 \u221211 pmol/\u00b5l DNA for E coding region, respectively, which is a 100-fold increase in sensitivity compared with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and conventional PCR. All 12 non-ZIKA respiratory pathogens tested were negative for LAMP detection, indicating the high specificity of the primers for ZIKV. In conclusion, a visual detection LAMP assay was developed, which could be a useful tool for primary quarantine purposes and clinical screening, especially in situations where resources are poor and in point-of-care tests.",

            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family [1] . Zika virus has been reported as a pathogen of sporadic human infection for nearly half a century [2] . A widespread epidemic of ZIKV infections was found in Central and South America recently [3] . On February 1, 2016, the disease has been declared as a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" by the World Health Organization (WHO) [2] . ZIKV is spread via mosquito transmission, sexual transmission, and vertical (mother to child) and blood transfusions [1] . The diagnosis of virus infection is typically performed by virus isolation, serological examinations, or specific antibodies from animals, but these methods are time consuming and not appropriate for clinical settings [4, 5] . In some virus laboratories, molecular-based diagnostic methods are employed using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), which takes several hours to obtain the results, which requires special equipment and skillful experiences [5, 6] , and is complicated to perform in resource-limited laboratories in developing countries [7, 8] . Therefore, it is important to develop faster, more sensitive, and more accurate methods for timely diagnosis. LAMP is an emergency nucleic acid detection technique which was reported in 2000 and it performs high specificity as the amplification of DNA is conducted by two to three pairs of primer recognizing six independent regions on target gene [9] . LAMP was developed to amplify target DNA without any temperature change, which typically required denaturation, annealing, and extension. As the method could proceed at constant temperature with only a thermostat as the only equipment required, it is an ideal method for use in the field or in time-sensitive situations [9] . This technology has been widely used in clinical diagnosis; qualitative and quantitative Edited by Joachim Jakob Bugert. detection of prevalent bacteria, viruses, and parasites; and fetal gender identification, etc. [7, 10] . Thus, LAMP could be a highly beneficial and convenient application to detect Zika virus due to its high specificity and stability, and it has been reported that LAMP shined a light on Zika virus [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

Reverse transcription was conducted according to standard procedure using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The DNA concentration was determined by measuring the optical density at 260 nm (OD260) and then dissolved in 20 \u00b5l of DEPC-treated water and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.

During the amplification process, the wax melted into a liquid without interfering with the reaction, and the wax solidified as the temperature in the tube fell to room temperature. Two different detection methods based on sample turbidity and fluorescence were used to detect the LAMP products. Spectrophotometric analysis was performed by recording optical density (650 nm) using a Loopamp realtime turbidimeter (LA-320C; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd.), and real-time changes in turbidity were monitored every 6 s. For direct visual detection, 1 \u00b5l of calcein fluorescence detection reagent was added to 25 \u00b5l of LAMP product. As the magnesium ions form a complex with calcein, LAMP amplification produces a green fluorescence emission.

Thus, the LAMP detection limit for NS5 gene is 0.5 \u00d7 10 \u22129 pmol/\u00b5l of the recombinant plasmids containing NS5 gene in a 65 \u00b0C reaction lasting for 40 min, and the LAMP detection limit for E gene is 1.12 \u00d7 10 \u221211 pmol/\u00b5l of the recombinant plasmids containing E gene in a 65 \u00b0C reaction lasting for 30 min. For the visual inspection, all positive reactions changed to green while negative ones remained orange under natural or 365 nm UV light (Fig. 4b, e) . These data indicate that the sensitivity of the two detection methods was the same. For comparison, real-time RT-PCR and PCR were performed. The detection limit of real-time RT-PCR for NS5 gene was 0.5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 pmol/\u00b5l and was achieved with a higher C t value (C t = 31.68 \u00b1 0.983) ( Table 4 ). The detection limit of PCR for NS5 gene was also 0.5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 pmol/\u00b5l (Fig. 4c) . The detection limit of real-time RT-PCR for E gene was 1.12 \u00d7 10 \u22129 pmol/\u00b5l and was achieved with a higher C t value (C t = 32.75 \u00b1 0.085) ( Table 5 ). The detection limit of PCR for E gene was also 1.12 \u00d7 10 \u22129 pmol/\u00b5l (Fig. 4f) . Therefore, we conclude that LAMP assay is more sensitive to ZIKV than real-time RT-PCR.",

These results not only stated that the visual LAMP method has the same specificity with using real-time turbidimeter but also had specificity for detecting ZIKV specific genes. Furthermore, we compared the ability of LAMP to detect NS5 and E sensitivity using 10-fold serial dilution of the recombinant plasmid containing NS5 or E gene with that of traditional PCR method and RT-PCR method. The detection limit of LAMP assay was 100-fold lower than the value of PCR and RT-PCR. More than that, LAMP can finish in 40 min with a simple thermostat.
