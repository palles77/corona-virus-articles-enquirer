The ykuD protein is a representative of a distinctly prokaryotic and ubiquitous family found among both pathogenic and nonpathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals the presence of an N-terminal LysM domain, which occurs among enzymes involved in cell wall metabolism, and a novel, putative catalytic domain with a highly conserved His/Cys-containing motif of hitherto unknown structure. As the wild-type protein did not crystallize, a double mutant was designed (Lys117Ala/Gln118Ala) to reduce excess surface conformational entropy. As expected, the structure of the LysM domain is similar to the NMR structure reported for an analogous domain from Escherichia coli murein transglycosylase MltD. The molecular model also shows that the 112-residue-long C-terminal domain has a novel tertiary fold consisting of a \u03b2sandwich with two mixed sheets, one containing five strands and the other, six strands. The two \u03b2sheets form a cradle capped by an \u03b1-helix. This domain contains a putative catalytic site with a tetrad of invariant His123, Gly124, Cys139, and Arg141. The stereochemistry of this active site shows similarities to peptidotransferases and sortases, and suggests that the enzymes of the ykuD family may play an important role in cell wall biology.",

All ErfK/YbiS/YhnG domains contain a highly conserved stretch of amino acids (\u03a6G\u03a6HGTX 10 (S/T)XGC\u03a6R(M/L), where \u03a6 is a hydrophobic residue and X denotes any amino acid). The presence of absolutely conserved His and Cys residues is suggestive of a catalytic function, probably as hydrolases or transferases (Fig. 1) . Many of these proteins also contain the so-called LysM domain, which appears to have a peptidoglycan-binding function and is found in enzymes involved in cell wall degradation, and other proteins that could be associated with bacterial cell walls. 2 Interestingly, homologous domains have also been discovered in a family of plant transmembrane receptor kinases, which are involved in the recognition of bacteria secreting lipochitin oligosaccharide signal molecules. 3 Only one structural study of a LysM domain has been reported to date. 2 The association of the ErfK/ YbiS/YhnG domain with the LysM module suggests that the former may also play a role in cell wall degradation or, more specifically, in peptidoglycan metabolism. This is interesting because such unique prokaryotic proteins constitute a particularly suitable target for antibiotics.",

The protein was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni(2 + )-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal-affinity chromatography. The affinity tag was removed during incubation with recombinant tobacco etch virus (rTEV) protease for 24 h. Protein was dialyzed against 20 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) (pH 6.5), 300 mM NaCl, and 1.4 mM \u03b2mercaptoethanol; and concentrated to 15 mg/mL for crystallization. Extensive screens yielded no results. Consequently, suitable sites for surface mutagenesis to enhance crystallizability were identified based on secondary structure prediction (http://www.bioinfo.pl). The dipeptide Lys-Gln (residues 117 and 118) was identified as one such potentially solvent exposed site and both residues were mutated to Ala with use of the QuikChange\u2122 mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Crystals of this mutant were obtained at 21\u00b0C from 0.1 M acetate (pH 4.5), 0.2 M Li 2 SO 4 , 30% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, and 10 mM CdCl 2 . The selenomethionine (Se-Met)-labeled protein was expressed in E. coli strain B843 and purified in a manner identical to that described for the native protein.

The average B factors for that part of the structure are higher than for the rest of the domain (~25 \u00c5 2 vs ~22 \u00c5 2 ), consistent with higher intrinsic mobility of the loop. Moreover, the LysM domain of ykuD does not form any significant crystal contacts, which may be a reason for its reduced stability.",

            "text": "Because the fingerprint of the ErfK/YbiS/YhnG domain family ( Fig. 1 ) contains strictly invariant His and Cys residues, often found in hydrolytic enzymes and transferases, the SMART database 1 suggests that the domain has a catalytic function; consequently, we will henceforth refer to it as such. As pointed out above, the most conserved residues cluster within the seventh and the ninth strands of the \u03b2-sheet. We note that the disposition of three residues -His123 and Gly124, located on \u03b2-strand 7, and Cys 139, located on \u03b2-strand 9-has distinct similarities to so-called catalytic triads present in a wide range of enzymes, including serine proteases, cysteines proteases, esterases, lipases, and a number of more esoteric, nonhydrolytic enzymes. 15 The role of a nucleophile is typically reserved for a Ser or a Cys, which interacts with the most invariant residue in a triad, a histidine, which in turn is hydrogen-bonded to a neutral or negatively charged H-bond acceptor. The details vary from family to family. 15 The interaction of Ser with His is in most cases mediated in the ground state by a weak H-bond between the hydroxyl and imidazol's unprotonated N\u03f52. During the acylation step, the hydrogen released by Ser is captured by His, which adopts the protonated, imidazolium form. In papainlike cysteine proteinases, the ground state enzyme contains an ion pair in which both Cys and His are found in the ionized forms as a thiolate and imidazolium, enhancing the nucleophilic potential of cysteines. 16 This pattern is not universal though, because viral 3C proteases operate by a general base mechanism, similar to serine proteases. 17 The conformation of the catalytic histidine is stabilized in all cases by additional interactions. In serine hydrolases, the N\u03b41 group of the imidazole is suitably positioned to donate an H-bond to Asp or Glu, 18, 19 and in two notable cases the accepting group is a backbone carbonyl 20,21 ; in the papain family of cysteine proteases, the N\u03f52 of the catalytic histidine donates an H-bond to Asn, although examples of enzymes with aspartates in that position are also known. 22, 23 In ykuD, the three amino acids of the putative triad are capable of forming similar interactions, albeit in the crystal structure, the side-chains of Cys139 and His123 in both molecules are perturbed by an intimate symmetric crystal contact that traps two Cd 2+ ions and two sulfates at the intermolecular interface (Fig. 3) . Cys139 directly coordinates Cd 2+ (sulfur-metal distance of 2.33 \u00c5), which is also coordinated by N\u03f52 of His119 from an adjacent protein molecule and two oxygen atoms of a sulfate ion, to complete a tetrahedral complex. The third oxygen of the sulfate accepts an H-bond from N\u03f52 of the catalytic His123. Thus, the thiolate of Cys139 actually points away from the imidazole of His123, not as expected for a catalytic triad. However, we believe that this is a crystallization artifact as a rotation around the \u03c7 1 torsion angle of Cys139 is sufficient to generate a canonical interaction with N\u03f52 of His123. The N\u03b41 of His123 donates an H-bond to the main chain carbonyl of Gly124, in a manner similar to other triads. Overall, the mutual disposition of Cys139, His123 and Gly124 strongly suggest that this group constitutes a variant of the ubiquitous catalytic triad [ Fig. 4 ",

The stabilization of the incipient oxyanion following the acylation step is accomplished within a so-called oxyanion hole, a positively charged surface crevice with two or three strong H-bond donors. 24, 25 Our atomic model reveals that a similar structure is also found within ykuD. The aforementioned sulfate molecule coordinated by the Cd 2+ ion fortuitously serves as an approximate model for the tetrahedral intermediate. One of its oxygens forms H-bonds with backbone amides of Lys137, the absolutely conserved Gly138, and Cys139. The distances are 3.19 \u00c5, 3.24 \u00c5, and 3.03 \u00c5, respectively. Two or three of these amides could act as the oxyanion hole, forming hydrogen bonds with the negatively charged oxygen of the tetrahedral intermediate of proteolytic reaction [ Fig. 4(A) ]. This observation further supports the notion that the putative active site's stereochemistry in ykuD is consistent with canonical general base mechanism for serine/cysteine hydrolases.",

            "text": "Although the stereochemistry of the putative active site in ykuD is consistent with it having a hydrolytic or transferase function, akin to that of a protease or an esterase, the tertiary fold of the catalytic domain is not similar to any of the triad-containing families, such as chymotrypsin, subtilisin, papain or \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase proteins. However, we note some limited topological similarities to the recently characterized structures of sortases (i.e., transpeptidases located in the cell envelope of Gram-positive bacteria) that catalyze the anchoring of specific cell-surface proteins via their unique LPXTG motif to a pentaglycine cross-bridge of peptidoglycans. [26] [27] [28] [29] In either sortase, the putative active site is located in a shallow depression on a concave side of a \u03b2-sheet, with the Cys residue found at the end of a \u03b2-strand. Interestingly, even though an involvement of a His residue has been postulated in sortases, the crystal structures suggest that it is a dyad of Cys and an invariant Arg that constitutes the active ensemble of residues. 30 This has been corroborated by biochemical studies of the Staphylococcus aureus sortase A, which showed that replacement of the relevant Arg197 with other amino acids severely impedes catalysis. 31 It has been postulated that Arg197 may facilitate the formation of a thiolate during the transpeptidation reaction catalyzed by the sortases. 31 Close inspection of the ykuD active site also reveals the presence of the side-chain of an arginine, Arg141, in the active site, in an immediate proximity of Cys139. The mutual disposition of the two amino acids is very similar to that seen in sortases [ Fig. 4(B) ]. Arg141 is conserved in all sequences of the ErfK/YbiS/YhnG domains (Fig. 1) . Thus, ykuD and its homologs appear to have within a short stretch of amino acids all the active site components found in cysteines-dependent proteinases and transpeptidases: a triad of Cys, His, and an Hbond acceptor stabilizing the imidazol, a well-formed oxyanion hole stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate, as well as a positively charged residue enhancing the nucleophilicity of the Cys. It is tempting to speculate that the structural similarities between ykuD constitute a reflection of functional parallels.",

            "text": "There are extensive contacts crystallographically related to dimers in the crystal structure, but there are specifically two crystal contacts that appear to stem directly from the surface mutations and crystallization conditions. The first contact is formed between two polypeptide chains related by noncrystallographic symmetry that belong to two adjacent noncrystallographic dimers (Fig. 3) . Not surprisingly, it involves the two mutated residues-Ala117 and Ala118. These amino acids are located, as predicted, on a solvent-exposed loop. Although the two alanines are not involved in any direct intermolecular interactions, the wildtype side-chains of Lys and Gln within this loop would have almost certainly caused a steric obstacle, preventing two ykuD molecules from interacting. The third residue involved in this contact is His119, which coordinates a cadmium ion (N\u03f52-Cd 2+ distance of 2.27 \u00c5) trapped between two protein molecules at the active site. The second crystal contact is mediated by sulfate ion sequestered between two arginines (Arg159) in the center of the noncrystallographic dimer. The distances between sulfate oxygen and N\u03b71 of arginines from molecule A and molecule B are 2.78 \u00c5 and 2.65 \u00c5, respectively. Moreover, N\u03b72 of Arg159 form molecule A creates one more hydrogen bond (3.40 \u00c5) with sulfate oxygen. This interaction is additionally stabilized by His57 from molecule A and by Tyr96 from molecule B.",

            "text": "Successful crystallization of ykuD depends on the mutations (wild-type protein does not crystallize), as well as the presence of both sulfate and Cd 2+ ions in the precipitant. The structure shows that the sulfate ions help stabilize a noncrystallographic dimer, while the Cd 2+ ions and mutations are critical in forming cross bridges between the dimers generating layers of molecules perpendicular to the c axis. We note that this crystal architecture has similarities to other successful cases of surface mutagenesis, where noncrystallographic dimers are found in the asymmetric unit. 33 CONCLUSION This is the first crystallographic structural study of a representative of a ubiquitous family of exclusively prokaryotic proteins that contain both the LysM module, which mediates interactions with cell wall peptidoglycan, and the ErfK/YbiS/YhnG domain. The structure of the B. subtilis ykuD reveals a well-formed putative catalytic site, identifying potential functional roles for specific conserved residues such as His123, Cys139, and Arg141. The stereochemistry of the active site strongly suggests that the enzyme is a peptidase or transpeptidase, although we cannot be certain of the substrate. The presence of ykuD homologs in a variety of pathogenic bacteria, and the likelihood that these proteins play a role in the maintenance of cell wall, will hopefully lead to a thorough functional characterization of these interesting enzymes. Sequence alignment of the fingerprint motif in pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria (\u03a6 is a hydrophobic residue and X denote any amino acid in consensus sequence). The ykuD putative active site involved in a crystal contact. Side-chains of select residues, as well as Gly124, are shown in full; sulfate ions are represented by spheres: red (oxygen) and green (sulfur). ",
