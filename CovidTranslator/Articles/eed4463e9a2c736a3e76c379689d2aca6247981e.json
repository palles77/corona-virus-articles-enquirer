This paper outlines a protocol to estimate influenza VE using linked laboratory and administrative data which could act as a companion to estimates derived from other methods. Methods and analysis We will use the test-negative design to estimate VE for each influenza type/subtype and season. Province-wide individual-level records of positive and negative influenza tests at the Provincial Laboratory for Public Health in Alberta will be linked, by unique personal health numbers, to administrative databases and vaccination records held at the Ministry of Health in Alberta to determine covariates and influenza vaccination status, respectively. Covariates of interests include age, sex, immunocompromising chronic conditions and healthcare setting. Cases will be defined based on an individual's first positive influenza test during the season, and potential controls will be defined based on an individual's first negative influenza test during the season. One control for each case will be randomly selected based on the week the specimen was collected. We will estimate VE using multivariable logistic regression. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Alberta's Health Research Ethics Board-Health Panel under study ID Pro00075997. Results will be disseminated by public health officials in Alberta.",

            "text": "Influenza is a respiratory viral disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality globally. Infections range from relatively mild presentations (eg, cough, sore throat) to severe lower respiratory tract infections (eg, pneumonia). Severe cases may be associated with hospitalisation, intensive care admission and death; young children, the elderly and individuals with chronic conditions are at highest risk of severe outcomes. 1 In Canada, rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza infections are, on average, approximately 200 cases per 100 000 population, with approximately 50% of cases occurring in patients aged \u226418 years. 2 The causative agents, influenza A (subtypes H3N2 and H1N1pdm(09)) and influenza B (Yamagata and Victoria lineages), are under strong selective pressure to mutate genetically; significant genetic changes can occur in relatively short periods of time (ie <1 year). 3 Influenza prevention relies, in part, on annual vaccination campaigns. Selection of viral strains for inclusion in the vaccine occurs approximately 9 months prior to the onset of the influenza season; by the time the vaccines are administered, the predominant circulating strains may have mutated to the point such that the effectiveness of the vaccine has diminished or has become completely ineffective. 4 5 Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) is commonly estimated using the test-negative design, a variation of the case-control design where cases and controls are selected from a pool of individuals who have been tested for influenza. 6-10 Several research groups use sentinel physician networks to recruit patients: influenza testing is performed on patients who meet a case definition for influenza-like illness, and cases and controls are Open access selected from that pool. [6] [7] [8] While this has become an established method, there are some limitations to using sentinel physicians. As the physicians are often volunteers, there can be bias in the geographic distribution, leading to clustering of sampling in certain areas and not others. This can lead to inaccuracies as predominant circulating influenza strains vary geographically. 7 11 Immunisation information is commonly self-reported, potentially leading to recall and social desirability biases 12 ; volunteer physicians may be more likely to have strong views on influenza immunisation, potentially making it more difficult for the patient to admit to not being immunised. Finally, as these studies are labour-intensive for clinic staff, physician recruitment is often low, resulting in small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals (CI). Estimates are, therefore, typically available after the peak of the influenza season, decreasing their usefulness for public health messaging and resource and operational planning. 6-8 11 Using administrative data and routinely collected clinical specimens for estimating VE is currently under debate. 13 VE estimates generated using linked health administrative and laboratory data in the province of Ontario have been shown to be comparable to previously published estimates. 14 There has been one published estimate of Alberta-specific VE using a sentinel surveillance system 11 ; however, because of the small sample size the CI was large, ranging from 8% to 72%. Estimating VE in a large jurisdiction with near-real-time data on all influenza laboratory testing and influenza vaccination in the population has the potential to provide more precise and timely VE estimates than has previously been possible. We present a protocol to estimate influenza VE using individually linked laboratory and administrative data.",

Annual vaccine campaigns begin in October, with approximately 60% of all influenza vaccinations given by the end of the second week of the campaign. While the peak of influenza activity has varied widely since 2010, the median influenza peak in Alberta is in mid-January, approximately 3 months after the vaccination campaigns begin. laboratory methods for influenza A and b detection and influenza A subtyping All influenza testing in Alberta is performed at a single diagnostic lab, the Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab) and stored in a single laboratory information system, along with test and patient identifiers. Clinical specimens (eg, nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavages) are processed at ProvLab using previously published protocols. Nucleic acid extraction utilises the easyMAG extractor and reagents (bioMerieux). 17 Nucleic acid from clinical specimens is then tested using a series of respiratory detection assays as described below. Prior to May 2017, a real-time influenza A/B reverse-transcriptase PCR was used to diagnose influenza using a protocol previously described. 18 19 After May 2017, ProvLab has been using a Luminex respiratory pathogen panel for the identification of influenza A (including subtype), influenza B and other respiratory viruses (eg, coronavirus and parainfluenza). 15 Results of the laboratory testing were imported into specific laboratory information systems depending on the testing time period.",

We will use multivariable logistic regression to estimate influenza VE as (1 -adjusted OR) \u00d7 100% and will compare the results to historical values of VE for the predominate subtype. We will estimate VE separately by influenza season and influenza subtype (ie, A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and influenza B). 33 When there is a large enough sample size in a particular season to provide adequate power, VE will be estimated for specific age groups such as children under the age of 5 and seniors over the age of 65. The following covariates will be included in the adjusted model, regardless of statistical significance: age, sex, socioeconomic status, geographic zone of residence, history of immunocompromising comorbidities, healthcare setting (inpatient or outpatient setting) and month of specimen submission within the influenza season. SAS V.9.4 will be used for all statistical analysis (SAS Institute). VE estimates will be compared with published estimates of VE. 6 7 11 13 34 35 As shedding of influenza virus continues for approximately 4-5 days after symptom onset, bias can result if specimens that are collected too long after symptom onset are used. 36 Most studies use a threshold of 7 days. 37 To test the robustness of the findings, a sensitivity analysis will be performed; controls will be restricted to those specimens positive for a different respiratory virus (ie, coronavirus, human respiratory syncytial virus) (as suggested by Sullivan et al 2016) .",

Frailty has been demonstrated to be a potential confounder of VE.

However, this may not affect the results significantly as a previous study indicated that inclusion of frailty in the multivariate model increased VE estimates only slightly. 42 Laboratory requisitions in Alberta do not contain illness onset date. Ideally this would be used to ensure that the negative laboratory test results were representative of an acute infectious period and that test-negative specimens were not collected after viral shedding had ceased. Sullivan et al 2016 have indicated this bias may be accounted for by selecting influenza test-negative controls that were positive for another respiratory virus. Requiring controls to be positive for another virus excludes individuals who are tested long after their acute infectious period. However, a recent systematic review found no differences when using different groups of controls. 43 Comparison of the VE results using administrative data to previously published studies, specifically sentinel surveillance for the same seasons (2011/12-2019/20), will help to identify further areas of refinement.",
