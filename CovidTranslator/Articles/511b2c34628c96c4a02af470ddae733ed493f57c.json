It provides a roadmap for effective tobacco control strategies to reduce demand for and restrict supply of tobacco products and gives signatory countries a timetable to achieve specified milestones. Tobaccorelated illness is a major component of the chronic diseases which cause a heavy human and economic toll. Tobacco control is thus a top priority in health promotion worldwide. This is particularly true in China, where the smoking prevalence is high (1, 2) , the price of cigarettes is low and affordable (3), the mortality from smoking related diseases is high (4) , and the awareness level of the health risks of smoking is still relatively poor despite some improvements in the last 15 years (5) . The country's 300 million smokers and 740 million men, women and children exposed to secondhand smoke are at risk of suffering from cancers, stroke, heart and respiratory diseases and other tobacco-related illnesses (6) . The cost of smoking in China was estimated to have gone up 154% in direct costs and 376% in indirect costs in the eight years from 2000 to 2008 (7) . This presents a significant challenge to China, a country which has made the epidemiological transition from infectious diseases to chronic diseases in a relatively short period of time as a result of the rapid economic development in the last few decades which brought about changing lifestyles (8) .",

China is by far the largest producer of tobacco in the world, producing 43% of the world total, which is more than the combined production of the next nine tobacco producing countries (10) . The China National Tobacco Company (CNTC) is the largest producer of cigarettes in the world, producing 2.375 trillion cigarettes in 2010 (11), a staggering 40% increase over the previous decade (12), and amounts to 41% of the world's total production in 2010 (10). Tobacco features significantly in government revenue, contributing in profits and taxes CNY752.9 billion in 2011 (US$118.5 billion, US$1 = CNY6.353 in Aug 2012) (13) (14) (15) , amounting to 7.26% percent of government revenue (16). Furthermore, the livelihood of 20 million tobacco farmers (17) , and millions more cigarette industry employees and over 300,000 cigarette retailers depend on tobacco farm subsidies, on growing tobacco leaf, on manufacturing jobs and on selling cigarettes for their livelihood (18) . In tobacco leaf growing provinces, more than half of the provincial government's revenue comes from tobacco. In the western province of Yunnan, for example, 77.8 percent of the provincial government's tax revenues in 2010 came from tobacco (19) (20) (21) .",

Even though the harmful effects of smoking are now well known, and it has also been established that tobacco leaf farming causes environmental degradation, deforestation and harms the health of tobacco leaf farmers (22) , government leaders view the continued growth of the tobacco industry as integral to the political and economic wellbeing of the country. As in many countries, achieving economic growth and political stability is the number one concern for political leaders in China, and tobacco control is not high on their list of priorities. The health consequences of smoking are considerations which are further out into the future than the tenure of most current political leaders. These considerations shape the attitude towards the country's tobacco control and FCTC implementation, and may explain the half-hearted efforts and miniscule resources that are devoted to it.",

CNTC acknowledges that smoking is harmful and funds research to find \"healthier\" alternatives for those who do smoke. Outreach activities, philanthropy and community building are also on their agenda, including activities for young people, building schools, and organizing health education seminars and academic conferences etc. The general intention of CNTC's philanthropy is similar to that of any other tobacco company: to win public support and build a positive image (23) . While such outreach and public interest activities are also conducted by many major international tobacco companies such as Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco, the CNTC has the advantage of being able to work directly with central and local governments, allowing the CNTC to provide funding for and to implement government collaborative projects such as building schools and improving local highways. In the context of the size of the tobacco industry, these public interest and philanthropic projects constitute a miniscule percentage of the income of CNTC. Yet, all these programs help to justify the importance of the tobacco industry in the local community (24) . A China Tobacco Museum in Shanghai is the largest such museum in the world. Built in 2004 and funded entirely by the industry, it is a shining example of the economic might and the social respectability the industry commands and the length that it goes to in order to ensure the reach and continued prosperity of the industry.",

Within the government structure, the highest powers reside with the National People's Congress. Power flows through the State Council to the relevant ministries: Health, Finance, Agriculture, Taxation, and Industry and Information Technology. The National People's Congress enacted the Tobacco Monopoly Law in 1991 aimed at protecting the industry and establishing it as a monopoly (18) . The State Council is advised by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the highest advisory mechanism in the country. The State Council gets policy inputs from its Development Research Center and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. CNTC falls under the jurisdiction of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA), which is responsible for supervising the enforcement of the Tobacco Monopoly law and relevant laws and regulations. In practice, STMA the regulatory body and CNTC the industry are the same entity, with one management structure. STMA sets overall policies and delegates to CNTC full authority to implement these policies. STMA is under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MOIIT) and has the goal of promoting the growth and stability of the tobacco economy (25-27). Thus both STMA and the industry itself have a strong stake to resist measures to implement FCTC. Of interest is the fact that the ICM is established under the MOIIT, and not the MOH. The Minister of MOIIT holds the chairmanship. The tobacco industry is under the purview of the MOIIT, and therein lies an intrinsic problem: the MOIIT's role of spearheading the implementation of FCTC as chairman of the ICM is in direct conflict with its role as the ministry responsible for the management and development of the tobacco industry (28) .",

Years of wrangling took place among the MOH, the STMA, and the China Association on Tobacco Control (CATC) which for a long time is the only nongovernment organization devoted to tobacco control. The content and size of the new labels which resulted from such deliberations were found to comply with the letter, but not the intent, of the FCTC provision. Words of the health warning are in very small font size, or are in English, which is not understood by most smokers (29) . Furthermore, graphic health warnings are considered inappropriate in the cultural context as cigarettes are often given as gifts on auspicious occasions. Cigarette companies, both Chinese companies and transnational companies, are eager to exploit this with elaborate packaging of cigarettes to be used as gifts (30) . As the STMA is a key member of the government's FCTC implementation committee, it can ensure that the measures taken cannot have the full effectiveness that is intended. New measures were introduced in April 2012 which called for larger font size and words to be in Chinese. The effectiveness of these new measures has yet to be studied. With regard to Article 15 of FCTC on restricted sales to minors, the legal minimum age to purchase cigarettes in China is 18. Enforcement of such a requirement among the hundreds of thousands of retailers is at best inconsistent.",

It has been shown that with an increase of CNY1 (US$0.1574) in the specific excise tax on a pack of cigarettes, which is estimated to lead to a 3.1 billion pack reduction in sales, the tobacco industry employment could lose about 1600 positions, assuming there is no opportunity for re-employment in the short-run (3) . Similarly, the income from tobacco farming is estimated to be reduced by CNY260 million (US $40.92million), assuming there is no crop substitution (3). In reality, however, there are always opportunities in both the industry sector and the farming sector for alternative employment and crop substitution. Even though the positive health impact of reduced production will lead to one million lives saved (3), and any negative impact on employment and farming would only be minimal, the Chinese government has often used the negative aspect as an excuse not to raise tobacco tax. International studies have also shown that reduction in cigarette consumption would not reduce overall employment in the economy, as the switch from cigarette consumption to consumption of other goods and services would create additional employment (32) .",

It is no wonder that the government drags its feet in implementing this single most effective measure in tobacco control, despite the fact that this regressivity argument has to be seen in the context that such tax increase may be progressive from a public health standpoint. Larger reductions in smoking have been found to occur for those smokers in the lower income groups (37) . The reluctance of the Chinese government to raise tax is evidenced by the fact that the 2009 tax adjustments involved a complicated reclassification of cigarettes price levels and their corresponding tax rates, leading to a decrease in tax rates in cigarettes at certain price levels. Even such an adjustment led to considerable debate in the media about the fairness of it all (38) .",

They are younger and have grown up in an era of reform and opening in China and are more open to western ideas and values. History has shown that each new leadership has sought to make their mark by initiating new philosophy and new initiative that seek to improve the well-being of the people. Tobacco control advocates should seize this window of opportunity to fight for an increase in tobacco tax, the most effective in the tobacco control toolkit. Of importance is the need to link any tax increase to the retail price of cigarettes. Another important tobacco control measure that the new leaders can use to demonstrate that they really have the intent to control the tobacco epidemic is to initiate legislation to enforce the smoke-free regulations with hefty penalties for those who do not comply.",

Experiences in many countries have shown that the tipping point in the battle against tobacco comes when nonsmokers become aware that passive smoking is harmful to their health and that they have a right to a smoke-free environment. A groundswell of popular sentiment can be effective in influencing top leaders. Civil society, with non-government organizations, opinion leaders and other advocates can be a catalyst for change. Other countries have shown that civil society can play a significant role in advocacy, coalition building, providing evidence-based information, being a watchdog as well as providing services such as smoking cessation counseling (43) . There is currently only a handful of non-government organizations working on tobacco control in China, notably the CATC. With funding from international organizations, the CATC has been able to become more proactive in organizing educational and intervention programs in tobacco control, cultivate opinion leaders, communicate with members of the National People's Congress, the highest legislative body, and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the highest advisory body. Furthermore, other NGOs such as the Chinese Red Cross, the All-China Women's Federation as well as academic bodies such as the Chinese Preventive Medicine Association have begun to devote efforts in recent years to tobacco control as part of their mission. The formation and involvement of more grassroots organizations to advocate for non-smoker's rights will be a step in the right direction.

With market-oriented activities and modern concepts of government oversight and monitoring increasingly becoming features of the Chinese economy, separating the tobacco industry from its regulatory state agency would be a step in the right direction. This will also move towards the goal of privatization of the tobacco industry. Two potential factors could lead the Chinese government to privatize the tobacco industry. First, with the growth of the Chinese economy, the role of the tobacco industry in terms of its economic contribution to central government revenue has been declining, as evidenced by the decreasing share of the industry's profit and tax contribution to central government revenue. Second, since China joined the World Trade Organization, transnational tobacco companies have become increasingly active in the Chinese cigarette market. Chinese tobacco economics research committees have begun to study whether the Chinese cigarette industry will become a \"sunset\" industry in the future. Top government officials also have been looking at examples of the privatization of the cigarette industry in foreign countries, such as in Korea, Thailand and Turkey. The MOH and the CATC have begun officially endorsing the idea of withdrawal of government ownership and the transfer of CNTC to the private sector. Having the CNTC as a private entity most likely would result in a less direct economic conflict of interest for the government, and make it less able to resist the implementation of FCTC provisions. Such a fundamental structural change will need to be achieved through the NPC which can legislate the necessary changes to the Tobacco Monopoly Law. At the level of the ICM, changing the leadership of the committee from the MOIIT to the MOH will elevate the emphasis placed on health as the most important consideration in the implementation of the FCTC.",

Separation of the STMA and the CNTC into distinct entities as regulator and industry respectively will be a first step towards privatizing the tobacco industry.
