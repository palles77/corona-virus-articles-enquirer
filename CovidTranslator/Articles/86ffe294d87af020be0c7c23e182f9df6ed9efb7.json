Multi-dimensional liquid chromatography (MDLC) coupled with bio-mass spectrometry (MS) is playing important roles in proteome research due to its high speed, high resolution and high sensitivity. Proteome analysis strategies mainly include bottom-up and top-down approaches which carry out biological sample separation based on peptide and protein levels, respectively. Electrophoretic methods combined with liquid chromatography like IEF-HPLC and HPLC-SDS-PAGE have been successful applied for protein separations. As for MDLC strategy, ion-exchange chromatography (IEX) together with reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is still a most widely used chromatography in proteome analysis, other chromatographic methods are also frequently used in protein pre-fractionations, while affinity chromatography is usually adopted for specific functional protein analysis. Recent MDLC technologies and applications to variety of proteome analysis have been achieved great development. A digest peptide-based approach as so-called \"bottom-up\" and intact protein-based approach \"top-down\" analysis of proteome samples were briefly reviewed in this paper. The diversity of combinations of different chromatography modes to set up MDLC systems was demonstrated and discussed. Novel developments of MDLC techniques such as high-abundance protein depletion and chromatography array were also included in this review.",

As an orthogonal highly resolving separation technique, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), introduced more than a quarter century ago [1, 2] still plays a central role in many analysis of proteome samples such as cell lines, tissues or biological fluids. But the 2D-PAGE has some limitations in protein analysis for high-(>150 kDa) and low-molecular weight (<10 kDa) proteins as well as those of proteins with extreme pI values. Another limitation of 2D-PAGE is that it cannot be coupled on-line with MS to achieve a fast multidimensional protein separation and identification [3] . As a result, multi-dimensional liquid phase-based separation methods using different electrophoretic and chromatographic techniques have been greatly developed as complementary methodologies. The feasibility of multi-modular combinations of HPLC, isoelectric focusing (IEF), chromatofocusing (CF), capillary electrophoresis (CE) as well as combinations of different HPLC modes provides numerous options for the separation of protein complexes and peptides.",

Such a strategy has made a great contribution in the research area of expression proteomics. While the \"top-down\" method is based on the separations of intact protein complexes, therefore it is able to get molecular information about the intact protein and may be advantageous for the detection of proteins' post-translational modifications (PTMs) [8] . Multi-dimensional separation methods are carried out either on peptide or on protein level according to their prospective goals.",

Balgley et al. developed an on-line capillary isoelectric focusing combined with nano-reversed phase liquid chromatography in an automated and integrated platform for cell heterogeneity proteome research [12] . CIEF fractions were loading directly to trap columns packed with C18 RPLC by using two 6-port microvalves. Ten micrograms of digested proteins extracted from glioblastoma multiforme tissue were loaded in CIEF-nano-RPLC-ESI-MS/MS run, and 6866 fully tryptic peptides corresponding to 1820 distinct proteins were identified. Compared with multi-dimensional HPLC runs like SCX-RPLC approach, CIEF-nano-RPLC method provides better resolution and requires less loading sample amount because of the ultrasensitive and excellent separation capability of capillary IEF. It is reported that the percentage of identified peptides present in more than one CIEF fraction is significantly less than that obtained from ion-exchange chromatography fractions [13] . Balgley et al. also utilize on-line CIEF-nano-RPLC-ESI-MS/MS for characterization of the human salivary proteome [14] . Micro-scale solution isoelectric focusing (sol-IEF) coupled with analytical narrowrange 2D-PAGE has been successfully used to improve detection of low-abundance proteins [15] . Westman-Brinkmalm et al. investigated sol-IEF as the pre-fractionation method prior to LC-MS/MS without cleaning up the buffer or detergent of the digested IEF fractions. This approach received better results than single LC-MS/MS separating approach and was also comparable to the results of sol-IEF coupled with 2D-PAGE in analysis of proteins from a glioma cell line [16] .

[19] [20] [21] as on-line multi-dimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) where the SCX and RPLC materials are sequentially packed into a single micro-capillary column (Fig. 1 ). Similar procedures were reported for the separation of other biological fluids or cells [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Zeng et al. [27] reported an integrated column that consisted of one strong cation-exchange column and one reversed phase column. These two columns were connected directly to fulfill an on-line SCX-RPLC-MS/MS analysis of mouse liver proteins. Nine pH gradients generated from citric acid-trimethylamine buffer or 10 mM citric acid-ammonium hydroxide buffer were utilized instead of salt gradients which is commonly used in sample elution of SCX column so that SCX fractions can be loaded directly into RPLC column. The exclusion of salt removal steps in traditional SCX-RPLC on-line or off-line separation approach is the key point to achieve fast 2D-LC separation and MS/MS identification. On this basis Zeng's group developed a SCX and SAX (strong anionexchange chromatography) combined pre-fractionation strategy called Yin-Yang multi-dimensional chromatography. It was used to provide an unbiased profiling of protein expression and phosphorylation of mouse liver tissue [28] . Peptides generated from SCX column with elution buffer at pH 2.5 were further separated by SAX column which also used a series of pH gradient buffer for gradient elution. Thereafter SAX fractions together with other SCX fractions were analyzed by nano-RPLC-MS/MS. This Yin-Yang MDLC was demonstrated to bare comprehensive separation ability towards peptide complexes with wide-spread pI values.",

Another application of this SCX trap column system was investigated by Wang et al. in the same research group [30] . Since SCX trap column was used instead of RP trap column, good separation performance as well as good proteomic coverage was presented.

The total peak capacity in this 2D separation can be greater than 5000 and high-sensitivity peptide identification may therefore be achieved because of increased resolution and the resultant decrease in peptide overlap [32] . Among various kinds of 2D-LC techniques, the combination of SCX mode separation in the first dimension and RP separation in the second dimension is the dominant separation technology of today. As a classical proteome research strategy, this SCX-RPLC approach provides thousands of biological information as a complement to traditional 2D-PAGE approach. Fujjj et al. described a typical on-line SCX-RPLC workflow in their publication [33] . Stepwise salt elution using ammonium formate was employed for SCX separations and resulted fractions were subjected to RPLC-MS analysis after concentration and desalting. Vitali et al. [34] also used SCX-RPLC-MS/MS strategy to identify highly expressed proteins from Bifidobacterium infantis. A comprehensive view of the gene complement of B. infantis was obtained by this analysis. Digested proteins were first separated through a SCX column and the fractions were collected every minute. After drying and resuspending, fractions were further separated and identified through a homemade RPLC coupling with Q-TOF mass spectrometer. Ru et al. [35] run digested human urine sample 10 times using a Mud-PIT strategy for proteomic profiling. The relatively less amount of sample loading than 2D gel or gel-LC-based strategies was achieved. Nagalla et al. [36] investigated human cervical-vaginal fluid (CVF) proteome utilizing SCX-RPLC-MS/MS as well as one-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis. A functional classification of human CVF proteome was made and compared with serum and amniotic fluid proteomes to provide a potential biomarker data foundation. Skipp et al. [37] did a research of Chlamydia trachomatis by a combination of 2-DE, MudPIT and SDS-PAGE-nano-RPLC-MS/MS strategies. Among these three approaches SDS-PAGE-nano-HPLC-MS/MS presented the best performance in detecting components of expressed proteome. Except for SCX-RPLC separation, McMullan et al. [38] used SAX column to separate soluble proteins of Geobacillus thermoleovorans T80 sub-proteome first, the fractions were collected, concentrated and digested into peptides to be further analyzed by RPLC-ESI-MS/MS. A total of 294 proteins were identified through this approach.",

A three-dimensional (3D) chromatography in coupling to MS/MS system was reported using SEC as pre-fractionation prior to online SCX-RPLC-ESI-MS/MS [53] . Normal human liver protein extracts was tryptic digested before and after SEC pre-separation (Fig. 2) . This SEC-SCX-RPLC method has been demonstrated to have great improvements in both proteome coverage and protein identification confidence in comparing to 2D-LC-MS. A lot of mid-and low-abundance proteins as well as proteins with extreme MW or pI were found in this work. Both preand post-proteolytic separations were studied to reveal that 3D chromatography was more effective for complicated proteome analysis. Both strategies were recommended to use for complicated samples, and post-proteolytic procedure was more efficient in protein identifications. Conrads et al. [54] used WAX or WCX columns as pre-fractionation step prior to SCX-RPLC-MS/MS analysis for mouse serum proteome research.

[67] adopted Gradiflow strategy as the prefractionation step prior to 2D-LC-MS/MS analysis of human plasma proteome. Zhang's group [68] developed a novel strategy of multi-dimensional chromatography separation in intact protein level for the depletion of high-abundant proteins existed in rat liver tissue extraction, as shown in Fig. 3 . Protein samples were first separated with a SCX column and fractions were collected every 2 min. Then SCX fractions were loaded onto RPLC column, respectively. Peak intensity of RPLC chromatogram detected by UV absorption detection was used to distinguish high-abundant proteins from mid-and low-abundant proteins. RPLC fractions with peak intensity above 0.1AU were taken as high-abundant proteins and depleted. After separations, fractions of high-abundance proteins were tryptically digested and MS/MS analyzed, whereas other fractions defined as mid-and low-abundant proteins were pooled together and submitted for further RPLC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 4) . The number of identified proteins was increased about three times in comparing to a 2D-LC due to the depletion of high-abundant proteins. This strategy was demonstrated to be more universal and low cost for proteome analysis.",

Six proteins with highest abundance were depleted and the serum was further ana-lyzed using different combination of separation methods such as chromatography/2D-PAGE, on-line or off-line LC-LC-MS spectrum. Different approaches bring up different information of sample's proteome. Meanwhile, selection of separation strategies can improve system resolution effectively. Barnea et al. [70] evaluated three pre-fractionation methods including SCX chromatography, SDS-PAGE and liquid phase IEF prior to 1D or 2D capillary LC separation. Hoffman et al. [11] evaluated comprehensive multi-dimensional separation strategies. Utilizing more than two dimensions of fractionation can effectively profile the low-abundance proteins in plasma proteome research. When the goal of proteome analysis is to find as many proteins as possible, the use of different pre-fractionation methods are quite necessary. Boyes et al. [71] integrated LC and PAGE methods for human serum proteome analysis. High protein recovery was maintained in pre-fractionation step so as to realize unbiased and reproducible analysis results. LC coupled with PAGE was also evaluated by Marcus et al. in analysis of membrane protein from mouse brain [72] . One-dimensional RPLC separation, 2D SCX/RPLC separation, PAGE/SCX/RPLC separation and 2D-PAGE strategies were assessed in this work.

Chromatography array technology has some challenges because of the complexity and high requirements for HPLC systems. However, many progresses have been made toward this area. Horn et al. [76] presented a high-throughput procedure for proteome research of native constituents. Human serum sample was first separated with SEC column in a mild condition and collected in 96-well microplate.",

All fractions were submitted for quantitative assay and MS identification. The use of microplate as a medium made it possible to fulfill a high-throughput array separation. This can even increase the system resolution by the adoption of a third separation dimension. Our group developed a capillary array RPLC-based multi-dimensional separation systems coupled with MALDI-TOF-MS/MS for high-throughput proteome research [77, 78] . It includes a SCX column as the first dimension and 10 parallel capillary RPLC columns as the second dimension [77] . The schematic diagram was shown in Fig. 5 . Multiple channel interface was fabricated. Digested proteins extracted from liver cancer tissue were analyzed by the system. Over 1202 proteins were found with only one-tenth time needed in common 2D-LC system. An automated and optimized system was further developed [78] . Capillary SCX chromatographic column was used as the first dimension and 18 parallel capillary RPLC columns were integrated as the second separation dimension (Fig. 6) . Peptides bound to the SCX phase were eluted using gradient elution. Effluents were sequentially transferred onto each subset of precolumns. After salt fractionation peptide fractions were concurrently back-flushed from the precolumns and separated simultaneously with 18 capillary RP columns. LC effluents were directly deposited onto the MALDI target plates for subsequent MALDI experiments. An 18-fold increase in throughput compared with serial-based 2D-LC system was realized by this new system. The effectiveness of array-based MDLC/MS platform for separation and identification of a complex proteome sample demonstrated that it would be a powerful high-throughput way for large-scale proteome research. Except for all the discussion and review above, MDLC chromatography separation science has been also used for protein-protein interaction [79] , traditional Chinese medicine research [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] , etc. The effects for chromatography separation conditions are also studied. Garc\u00eda studied the effect of mobile phase additives on sensitivity in the analysis of peptides and proteins by HPLC-ESI-MS [86] . Wang et al. evaluated various chromatography conditions including alkyl chain length in the stationary phase, capillary column temperature, and ion-pairing agent, on intact protein separations for top-down proteomics [87] . While Millea et al. investigated the effect of protein mixture separation using linear and step gradients in the first dimension of IEC-RPLC strategy [88] . Comprehensive multi-dimensional liquid chromatography techniques were summarized in a review published lately [89] .",
