            "text": "Background: Timely diagnostic investigation to establish the microbial etiology of pneumonia is essential to ensure the administration of effective antibiotic therapy to individual patients. Methods: We evaluated a multiplex PCR assay panel, the FilmArray\u00e2 pneumonia panel (Fil-mArray PP, BioFire Diagnostics), for detection of 35 respiratory pathogens and resistance determinants and compared the performance of the standard-of-care test in intensive care unit patients with lower respiratory tract infections. Results: Among the 59 endotracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens obtained from 51 adult patients, FilmArray PP was effective in detecting respiratory bacterial pathogens with an overall positive percent agreement of 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.5e97.9%) and negative percent agreement of 97.4% (95% CI, 96.0 e98.4%). FilmArray PP semiquantitative reporting demonstrated a concordance rate of 53.6% for the culture-positive specimens and 86.3% for the culture-negative specimens. FilmArray PP detected 16 viral Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection (2019) 52, 920e928 targets, whereas the conventional viral isolation failed, except influenza A, which showed 100% concordance with PCR. Coinfections were detected in 42.3% of the specimens. Substantial discrepancies were observed in identifying antimicrobial resistance gene targets and in the susceptibility testing. However, FilmArray PP may still be useful at the early stage of pneumonia before culture and susceptibility test reports are available. Consequently, the results of FilmArray PP might alter the antibiotic prescription in 40.7% of the patients. Conclusions: FilmArray PP offers a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method for lower respiratory tract infections. However, clinical correlation is advised to determine its significance in interpreting multiple pathogens and detection of genes involved in antimicrobial resistance.",

            "text": "Pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalization and death globally. According to the latest available data from the World Health Organization (WHO), lower respiratory tract infection is the fourth most common cause of mortality, causing 3.0 million deaths worldwide in 2016. 1 A delay in antibiotic administration can adversely affect the prognosis of pneumonia. Guidelines recommend early initiation of antibiotics in patients with pneumonia as several studies have suggested survival benefit when antibiotics are administered within 4 h of presentation. 2e4 Diagnostic investigations establishing the microbial etiology of pneumonia are essential to ensure the administration of effective antibiotics to the patients. 5 However, current therapy is typically initiated on an empirical basis, as even with the best diagnostic methods, a causative pathogen is often not detected in a significant proportion of pneumonia episodes. The Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study reported a pathogen detection rate of 38% in patients who were hospitalized for pneumonia using traditional diagnostic techniques, including standard culture, antigen detection assay, and nucleic acid detection tests. 6 Such a low detection yield certainly calls for a more timely and sensitive diagnostic tool in pathogen identification. Nonetheless, differentiating the isolation of true pathogens and coincidental carriage strains in lower respiratory tract infections remains a challenge. 7 Over the last few years, molecular investigations have emerged as the diagnostic tool of choice for respiratory pathogens, particularly viruses, owing to its superior sensitivity in detecting organisms that are difficult to isolate, less viable, or present in only small numbers. 8 They are also less likely to be affected by prior antibiotic administration than those affected by standard culture methods. 9 In addition, molecular diagnostics may provide additional information regarding the presence of antibiotic resistance genes, which may promise better-targeted antimicrobial therapy and improve antibiotic stewardship.",

Most of the enrolled subjects were intubated; hence, the specimens were collected from endotracheal aspirates rather than expectorated sputum, which may be contaminated with the normal flora or colonizers from the upper respiratory tract. All the specimens were transported to the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of the Hospital for analysis. The median time from specimen collection to loading into the FilmArray pouch was 1 h and 8 min (range, 12 min to 7 h and 30 min).

            "text": "In this prospective study, the performance characteristics of FilmArray PP were estimated by measuring its agreement with the standard-of-care diagnostic investigation. The overall performance of FilmArray PP was comparable to other multiplex respiratory platforms with an overall agreement of >80% for all the available targets tested. 13, 14 Most of the bacterial targets detected were Gram-negative pathogens (GNB) and viruses accounting for 27% of all cases. According to the local epidemiology data, the FilmArray PP may reach approximately 70e90% coverage for the most prevalent agents responsible for moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia among adults in Taiwan, and 70e80% coverage for healthcareassociated pneumonia. 15e17 In line with our results, a systematic review of the etiologic agents of communityacquired pneumonia in Asia revealed a high prevalence of GNB and S. aureus as causative pathogens as compared to the commonly observed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in the western countries. 18, 19 The incidence of respiratory tract infection caused by S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae has also reduced following implementation of vaccination programs among the elderly and children. 20, 21 Additionally, discrepancies could have been caused by the fastidious nature of H. influenzae, which is difficult to culture. 22 In our study, three specimens of H. influenzae were observed by FilmArray PP but were not recovered by culture. Two of these specimens reported 10 4 copies/mL of bacteria which might be too low to yield a positive culture. Both serology and culture methods failed to identify the two L. pneumophila found by FilmArray PP. The diagnosis of Legionella infection has been limited by difficulties in its culture and the non-specific nature of serological investigations, which only identifies L. pneumophila serogroup 1 but not the other species and serogroups. 23, 24 Most of the discordant results (FilmArray PP positive but culture-negative) in our study were probably caused by antibiotic use prior to sampling. As the nucleic acid of an organism may persist in vivo independent of the organism's viability, the detection of a target does not indicate that the corresponding organisms are the causative agents for the particular clinical symptoms. Likewise, the performance of the FilmArray PP has not been established for monitoring the treatment of infection. Another challenge posed by molecular diagnostics for respiratory pathogens is the difficulty in distinguishing colonization from infection. Though the presence of non-colonizing organisms may suggest disease causation, certain respiratory pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, rhinovirus, or adenovirus may colonize in the upper airway of an asymptomatic individual, and thus, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. 5 Quantification of microbial load by molecular methods may provide some clues as isolates with greater quantities are more likely to be clinically significant. 9 Defining the true pathogen responsible for the disease is further complicated by the detection of co-infections. In this study, coinfections (both viral-bacterial and multiple bacterial pathogens) were identified in 42.3% of the specimens. Nevertheless, there is growing evidence regarding the incidence and pathogenesis of polymicrobial pneumonia 25e27 and the recent major revelation of the lung microbiome has challenged our traditional paradigm that lungs are sterile and that pneumonia is caused by a single invasive pathogen. 28, 29 Future research on pneumonia thus needs to address the conundrum of polymicrobial respiratory disease and its impact on the pathogenesis of pneumonia. 29 There were substantial discrepancies in the detection of antimicrobial resistance genes in our study. As there are multiple genetic variants and mechanisms of resistance, the detection of no resistance gene does not imply susceptibility to the associated antibiotic. Similarly, the presence of a specific genetic marker cannot be linked to the pathogen detected. Complete culture and susceptibility testing should, thus, be performed for each potential following the recommended guidelines. 30 Several limitations to this study could be addressed of which the most notable one is the lack of a \"gold-standard\" reference method to clarify the discrepant results between FilmArray PP and conventional investigations. Multiplex PCR is more likely to have better sensitivity than traditional culture and serological investigation, and thus, leading to difficulties in interpreting the clinical significance of falsepositive results. 8 Therefore it is inappropriate to consider a positive FilmArray PP result as false-positive when compared to a less-sensitive test. 5 The unavailability of an established reference hinders the true estimate of accuracy. Next, the patients enrolled in the study were highly heterogeneous. Patients with various causes of respiratory failure, including community-acquired pneumonia, healthcare-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or non-infectious lung disease, who required intubation for ventilatory support, were included in the study. While the respiratory specimens obtained from intubated patients are more representative of the site of infection and are less likely to be contaminated by upper airway flora, the pathogens responsible for each clinical context were different and may not be parts of the targets in the panel. For instance, nosocomial pathogens, such as S. maltophilia, B. cepacia complex, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, 31 might outgrow the common causative bacteria as a result of antibiotic selection, thereby leading to under-detection as they were not included in the panel. Some pathogens, such as Pneumocystis jiroveci and nontuberculous mycobacteria that were also not included in the panel, commonly cause respiratory infections in immunocompromised hosts in Taiwan. 32e35 However, this enables us to understand the application of the FilmArray PP across different patient populations. In summary, the FilmArray PP may provide early information on the causative pathogens and their determinants of resistance, allowing a pathogen-directed antibiotic therapy with 70e90% coverage for the most prevalent bacteria causing moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia among the adults in Taiwan. Although FilmArray PP may not replace conventional culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, especially for bacterial targets, it is still an efficient adjunct to guide clinical decisions and antibiotic treatment in the early stages of pneumonia.",
