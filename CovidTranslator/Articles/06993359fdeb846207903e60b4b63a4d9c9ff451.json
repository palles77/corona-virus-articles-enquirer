            "text": "Diarrhea and respiratory diseases are clinically important and cause high mortality in calves (Virtala et al., 1996) . Bovine coronavirus (BCV) is an economically important cause of intestinal and respiratory diseases in calves and has also been implicated in winter dysentery of adult cattle (Clark, 1993) . Despite differences in clinical disease, it is believed that all BCV isolates belong to a single serotype (Clark, 1993) . The genome of coronaviruses is the largest among the RNA viruses (Lai, 1995) . Coronavirus has a high frequency of recombination, RNA polymerase lacks proofreading, and defective interfering RNAs are frequently generated in coronaviruses (Lai, 1995) . BCV isolates from Canada have been divided into three subgroups on the basis of reactivity with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against spike protein of BCV (Michaud and Dea, 1993) . Veterinary Microbiology 67 (1999) 221\u00b1230 The current modified, live BCV vaccine is not clinically effective (Thurber et al., 1977) and lack of clinical efficacy of the vaccine may be due to antigenic differences among the vaccine and field isolates of BCV. Minor antigenic and biological differences have been observed among BCV isolates from calf diarrhea and winter dysentery cases from the USA (Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995) and Canada (Dea et al., 1995) . To further understand the molecular epidemiology of BCV, 94 BCV isolates from eight states of the USA were compared. We compared antigenic differences on one-way hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test, isoelectric focusing of BCV proteins, and relative susceptibility of BCV isolates to hygromycin B.",

For HI test, four to eight HA units of BCV isolates (in 25 ml) were mixed with 20 ml of treated BCV antiserum. After incubation for an hour at 378C, 1% mouse erythrocyte suspension (25 ml) was added.

BCV isolates do not differ significantly in reactivity on indirect immunofluorescent test (Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995) . Either slight or no differences were observed on virus neutralization tests (Dea et al., 1995; Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995) . Because spike protein is the major immunogen that elicits antibodies detected by neutralization and indirect fluorescent antibody tests (Saif, 1993) and elicits a bulk of cross reactive antibodies among BCV isolates, spike protein may not be very useful to differentiate BCV isolates. Minor antigenic variation has been observed among BCV isolates from neonatal calf diarrhea and winter dysentery cases by a one-way test (Dea et al., 1995) . Our results in this study Fig. 2 . Hemagglutination-inhibition activity of an anti-bovine coronavirus (Mebus isolate). Antiserum against cell culture propagated bovine coronavirus isolates: on the basis of a one way HI test, 77 BCV isolates were inhibited from 1 : 2 up to 1 : 1024. X-axis denotes the HI titers and the numbers indicate superscripts (Log 2). Y-axis indicates number of BCV isolates inhibited. support and extend the previously reported findings on HI test using a large number (94) of American isolates collected from eight different states of the USA. None of the previous studies (Dea et al., 1995; Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995) reported HI results on wild-type BCV or the virus in fecal samples. Results on wild-type isolates may need cautious interpretation because the presence of colostral IgGl and local IgA in feces may interfere with results. On the other hand, passaging of BCV also affects HI. Passage of BCV in cell culture may also affect the antigenic composition (Hussain et al., 1991) , hemagglutination activity (Storz et al., 1992) , and intestinal replication of BCV (Kapil et al., 1990) . It is important to study all isolates at low passage (up to passage 3 or 4) and at the same passage. In the only other American study, samples were studied at different passages (Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995) .",

When cell culture-propagated and wild-type versions of BCV (WI-17) were compared, they showed HI titers of 1 : 128 and 1 : 2048, respectively. This may be because the hyperimmune serum used in the HI test was produced with a BCV isolate that was highly adapted in cell culture or it could be due to the presence of some antibodies in feces or it may be a unique property of the WI-17 isolate. Typing of wild-type BCV isolates by HI may be useful to study the epidemiology of BCV.

In our studies, a suitable point of application of samples was determined by applying purified BCV at three different places: 1.5, 2.7, and 3.9 cm from the cathode. Sample application at 1.5 cm from the cathode was not suitable because the bands were wavy. Application of samples at 2.7 cm from the cathode was found to be suitable for IEF analysis (Fig. 3) .

The mechanism of action of hygromycin B is not known; however, differential susceptibility of BCV isolates points to direct action of hygromycin B on BCV RNA replication. Because most isolates of BCV were found to be susceptible to low concentrations of hygromycin B (0.5 mM) and because hygromycin has no reported toxicity in cattle, hygromycin B may be a possible treatment for scours caused by BCV. Moreover, relative susceptibility of BCV isolates to hygromycin B provides an easy epidemiological marker to differentiate BCV isolates, into susceptible and resistant categories and can be easily adopted by diagnostic laboratories trying to differentiate BCV isolates. Susceptibility of BCV isolates to hygromycin B can be adopted by most veterinary diagnostic laboratories that have facilities for cell culture. First, BCV is isolated in HRT-18 in the presence of trypsin and pancreatin (Kapil et al., 1996) . The virus is then propagated in the presence of hygromycin B to access the susceptibility and the titer of the virus is measured by a HI.",

Similarly, we have observed only minor changes among two hemagglutinin esterase cDNAs sequenced so far (Zhang and Kapil, unpublished results) .
