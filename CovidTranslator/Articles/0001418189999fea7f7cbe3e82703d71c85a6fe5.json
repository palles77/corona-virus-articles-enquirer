Infected mononuclear cells were also isolated from exudates (Cammarata Parodi et al., 1993; Paltrinieri et al., 1999) . In one way or another, these infected cells succeed in staying alive and transmitting www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 121 (2007) [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] virus to new susceptible cells in the presence of a high concentration of antibodies. How they do this, is not known. Infected cells are normally eliminated by the adaptive immune system through antibody-mediated lysis or cell-mediated lysis. For the antibody-mediated lysis, the presence of antigens on the surface of infected cells is important for the recognition of these cells by antibodies and the subsequent destruction by the immune system (Sissons and Oldstone, 1980) . For pseudorabies virus (PRV) end equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), it has been described that absence of antigens on the surface membrane of infected monocytes, due to antibody-induced internalization or lacking of expression, respectively, protects the infected cells from efficient complement-mediated lysis (van der Meulen et al., 2003 (van der Meulen et al., , 2006 Van de Walle et al., 2003) .",

Some of the newly synthesized viral proteins in infected cells are disintegrated by proteasomes, the peptides are coupled to major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) and transported to the plasma membrane of the infected cell. This complex is recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes which kill the infected cell. Viruses have developed various ingenious ways to block the MHC I antigen presentation pathway (Hewitt, 2003) . For pseudorabies virus (PRV), it has been described that during antibody-induced internalization of viral glycoproteins in infected blood monocytes, the MHC I molecules are co-internalized . Absence of MHC I molecules allows PRV-infected cells to hide from the cell-mediated immunity (Favoreel, 1999) .

Binding of virus-specific antibodies to viral proteins present on the surface, makes infected cells recognizable for the classical complement pathway, phagocytes and natural killer cells, which will lead to lysis of infected cells (Harper, 1994) . In this study, viral antigens were not detected on the surface of FIPV positive cells isolated from nine cats with FIP. This could implicate that the FIPV positive cells may remain ''invisible'' for the humoral immune system and continue the production of progeny virus without being eliminated. It is not known which mechanism lies behind the absence of surface expressed viral antigens. The results of the cultivation experiment demonstrated that about half of the infected cells are not capable of expressing viral antigens on their surface. This observation is consistent with the in vitro findings of Dewerchin et al. (2005) . They showed that 50% of FIPV 79-1146 infected monocytes do not express viral antigens on the plasma membrane.",

In this study, the presence of MHC I on FIPV positive cells was analyzed. On all FIPV positive cells MHC I was present, showing that no internalization or retention of the MHC I molecules occurs. However, with the used techniques, it was not possible to quantify the number of MHC I molecules and to determine whether the MHC I molecules were loaded with FIPV peptides.",

The cause of this difference between pyogranulomas and exudates is not clear. The increased cell death may be due to infection or to the response of the immune system on the infected cell. Since no viral antigens are present on the plasma membrane, it can be stated that antibody-mediated lysis is inhibited. The expression of MHC I is not inhibited in infected cells, indicating that the cellular immunity may still be able to lyse the infected cell, if viral peptides are presented. It is generally accepted that a strong cellular immunity enables the cat to overcome infection (Pedersen and Black, 1983; Hayashi et al., 1982; Weiss and Cox, 1989) . However, it has also been postulated that, during a chronic FIPV infection, the cell-mediated lysis is inhibited due to apoptosis and T-cell depletion caused by soluble mediators released during infection (Haagmans et al., 1996; de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) . Taking into account all these observations, it becomes clear that the outcome of a FIPV infection is a complicated interaction of the immune system and the virus. One thing is sure, the humoral immune response is not able to protect the cat against progression of viral replication and consequently of disease. The precise role of the cellular immune response in protection needs to be further investigated.",
