Syncopal episodes are uncommon in horses, and generally few or no premonitory warning or presyncopal (faintness) signs are evident to the rider or handler. The subsequent loss of consciousness and collapse may be potentially harmful or dangerous to the horse and the rider. Despite the infrequent reports of true syncopal episodes in horses, the clinical signs are sufficiently dramatic to cause great concern on the part of the owner. Syncope in horses has been virtually unstudied. Consequently, most of the following information has been drawn from studies of persons and other animal species.",

Horses may be slightly unsteady or struggle during recovery. After a syncopal attack, the horse will completely recover and appear normal.",

Cerebral blood flow is maintained primarily by arterial blood pressure and cerebrovascular resistance. In response to falling or rising systemic blood pressure, the cerebral blood flow autoregulatory mechanism automatically regulates cerebral vessels to constrict or dilate. This control phenomenon maintains a constant cerebral blood flow despite fluctuations in arterial blood pressure, whether or not these fluctuations are physiologic or pathologic. If perfusion pressure in human beings falls below 60 mm Hg, the cerebral blood flow autoregulatory mechanism may fail. Mean resting arterial pressure measured at the carotid artery in horses has been reported to be 97 \u00b1 12 mm Hg at a heart rate of 42 \u00b1 10 beats/min. 1 Systolic pressure in horses experiencing syncope has not been determined.",

            "text": "In horses, syncope may be cardiogenic or extracardiac (neurocardiogenic) in origin. The primary cause of syncope in horses is generally cardiovascular disease. Cardiogenic syncope may result from (1) myocardial disease, (2) cardiac dysrhythmias (i.e., atrial fibrillation and third-degree heart block), (3) congenital heart disease, (4) pulmonary hypertension or stenosis, and (5) pericardial disease. Although many of these conditions are uncommon in horses, atrial fibrillation has been associated with several reports of syncope. 4 Cardiovascular disease, resulting in an inability to regulate heart rate or in stroke volume, ultimately decreases cardiac output. Atrial fibrillation can lead to heart rates greater than 240 beats/min with submaximal exercise. The lack of effective atrial contraction prevents complete ventricular filling at the end of diastole, thus causing a great reduction in effective cardiac output. Complete heart block may be persistent or intermittent and also has been associated with syncopal episodes in horses. When the block is complete and the pacemaker below the block fails to function, syncope occurs. This situation has been reported in human beings and horses as Morgagni-Adams-Stokes syndrome. This syndrome is the most frequent arrhythmic cause of syncope in human beings. 5 Morgagni-Stokes-Adams attacks result from an advanced atrioventricular block and usually involve a momentary sense of weakness followed by an abrupt loss of consciousness. After cardiac standstill or prolonged periods of asystole, unconsciousness results from cerebral ischemia. These \"cardiac faints\" have been reported to occur several times a day in human beings. Additional, less common causes of cardiogenic syncope usually involve the distal conduction system (His-Purkinje system) and may be persistent or episodic. Heart block involving the atrioventricular node or proximal conduction system may be congenital or drug induced (e.g., digitalis). Sick sinus syndrome, a condition described in elderly human beings, involves impaired sinoatrial impulse formation or conduction and has been associated with cerebral anoxia. With any of these conditions, cardiac output does not increase sufficiently during skeletal muscle exercise to meet peripheral oxygen demands. Blood preferentially flows to exercising muscle, resulting in systemic arterial hypotension, which results in cerebral ischemia leading to weakness or syncope.",

The term neurocardiogenic syncope more accurately describes this phenomenon. Neurocardiogenic syncope is the most common type of syncope reported in human beings and often is precipitated by stress or pain. 6 Although not specifically described in horses, a similar mechanism of collapse likely may exist. The critical cardiovascular features include hypotension and paradoxical sinus bradycardia, heart block, or sinus arrest after sympathetic excitation. Additionally, cardiac asystole may occur as an extreme manifestation of neurocardiogenic syncope. The mediating mechanisms of neurocardiogenic syncope are not well understood; however, several theories have been proposed. Hypercontractile states may cause excessive stimulation of the myocardial mechanoreceptors (C fibers) located in the left ventricle. The result is an exaggerated parasympathetic afferent signal carried by the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves with a subsequent decrease in sympathetic tone. Inhibition of sympathetic vasoco strictor activity results in vasodilation, which may be especially evident during periods of vigorous activity and increased heart rates and blood pressure. The excess vagal activity produces bradycardia and a decrease in cardiac output. This combination, along with a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, ultimately leads to syncope.",

Before pursuing a lengthy diagnostic workup, verifying that 24-hour urine production and voluntary water consumption exceed reference ranges is important. Urine production in adult horses may range from 15 to 30 ml/ kg/day, and values as high as 48 ml/kg/day have been reported. [1] [2] [3] [4] Daily urine volume is affected by diet; more water is lost in the urine in horses fed pelleted diets and legume hays than in horses fed grass hay. The latter excrete more water in feces. 5, 6 Generally, any component of the diet that increases renal solute load increases urine volume (e.g., high salt content in the diet). Voluntary water intake also is affected by the ambient temperature (Table 3 .2-1). When temperatures are high and evaporative water losses increase to cool the horse, voluntary water intake also increases. Diet and climatic conditions therefore must be considered when interpreting water consumption and urine production data. Water requirements are proportional to metabolic body size rather than to body mass. Thus larger horses, particularly draft breeds, require less water per kilogram than do smaller horses, ponies, or miniature horses. In addition, fat is low in water content compared with lean body tissue, and fat animals require proportionately less water than do lean animals. 7 Some owners may misinterpret polyalkiuria (frequent urination usually of small volume) as polyuria. Quantitative collection of urine for a 24-hour period may be required to verify excessive urine production. Several simple collection apparatuses have been described. 8, 9 ",

            "text": "Maintenance of water homeostasis depends on establishing a balance between intake and excretion such that plasma osmolality remains constant (within approximately 2% of normal). 10 The primary determinant of renal water excretion is antidiuretic hormone (ADH). 11 ADH is a polypeptide synthesized in three nuclei in the hypothalamus (suprachiasmatic, paraventricular, and supraoptic nuclei) 12 supraopticohypophyseal tract into the posterior lobe of the pituitary where ADH is stored. Some ADH enters the cerebrospinal fluid or portal capillaries of the median eminence from the paraventricular nucleus. 11 In addition, neurons from the suprachiasmatic nucleus deposit ADH in other areas in the central nervous system. 12 In human beings, lesions of the posterior pituitary or supraopticohypophyseal tract below the median eminence usually do not lead to permanent central diabetes insipidus because ADH still has access to systemic circulation in these cases. 11 The clinical importance of these anatomic relationships in horses is not known. ADH increases renal water reabsorption and urine osmolality by augmenting water permeability of luminal membranes of cortical and medullary collecting tubules. ADH augments urea, and in some species NaCl, accumulation in the interstitium, therefore promoting medullary hypertonicity. The primary stimuli for ADH release are plasma hyperosmolality and depletion of the effective circulating blood volume. Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus detect changes in plasma osmolality of as little as 1%. 11 Although the threshold for ADH release in the horse is not known, 24-hour water deprivation in healthy ponies resulted in approximately an 8 mOsm/kg increase in plasma osmolality (about 3%), from 287 \u00b1 3 mOsm/kg to 295 \u00b1 4 mOsm/kg, which was associated with an increase in plasma ADH concentration from 1.53 \u00b1 0.36 pg/ml to 4.32 \u00b1 1.12 pg/ml. 13 In another study of ponies, water deprivation for 19 hours resulted in an increase in plasma osmolality from 297 \u00b1 1 mOsm/L to 306 \u00b1 2 mOsm/L. 14 In human beings, plasma osmolalities of 280 to 290 mOsm/L stimulate ADH release. The organs that sense changes in effective circulating blood volume include arterial and left atrial baroreceptors. These stretch receptors function indirectly as volume sensors by responding to the reductions in intraluminal pressure that typically accompany loss of plasma volume. Reduced activation of these receptors by hypovolemia or heart failure is a potent cause of ADH release, even in the absence of increased plasma osmolality. ADH secretion also may be stimulated by stress (pain), nausea, hyp glycemia, and certain drugs including morphine and lithium. 11 When the need for water in body fluids cannot be met by conservation via the renal/ADH axis, thirst is stimulated. Thirst is regulated primarily by plasma tonicity; however, in human beings the threshold for stimulation of thirst is approximately 2 to 5 mOsm/kg greater than that for stimulation of ADH release. 11 Thirst is controlled by osmosensitive neurons in close proximity in the hypothalamus to osmoreceptors that mediate ADH secretion. 12 Thirst is sensed peripherally by oropharyngeal mechanoreceptors as dryness of the mouth. Thirst also may be stimulated by volume depletion through an incompletely understood mechanism. Experimental ponies drank when their plasma osmolalities increased by 3% after water deprivation, when plasma Na concentrations increased by approximately 5%, and after induction of a plasma volume deficit of 6%. 14",

            "text": "For the kidney to make concentrated urine, ADH must be produced, the renal collecting tubules must respond to ADH, and the renal medullary interstitium must be hypertonic. Generation of medullary hypertonicity is initiated in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle by active transport of NaCl out of the lumen. Because the thick ascending limb is impermeable to water, active resorption of NaCl results in hypotonicity of the fluid entering the distal tubule in the renal cortex ( , which is reabsorbed down its concentration gradient into the interstitium. Reabsorbed water is transported rapidly out of the interstitium by the extensive cortical capillary network, and interstitial hypertonicity is preserved. Urea remains in the lumen of the distal tubule and cortical collecting duct and is concentrated further. Luminal fluid flows into the medullary collecting duct, which is permeable to water and urea when under the influence of ADH (Figure 3 .2-1, C). Water is reabsorbed down its progressively steeper concentration gradient as luminal fluid moves through the medullary collecting ducts. Some urea also is reabsorbed into the interstitium. Reabsorbed water is removed efficiently by the vasa recta in the renal medulla. Because these blood vessels also are arranged in a hairpin loop, minimal loss of medullary interstitial solute occurs with water removal. Some reabsorbed urea enters the loop of Henle ( Figure  3 .2-1, D) and thus is recycled, helping to maintain medullary hypertonicity. In the absence of ADH, the collecting ducts are relatively impermeable to water and urea, resulting in water and urea loss in urine and reduction of medullary solute. Prolonged diuresis of any cause may result in the loss of medullary hypertonicity (medullary washout) with subsequent impairment of renal concentrating ability. Water is reabsorbed down its concentration gradient from the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle (Figure 3 .2-1, E) as a consequence of medullary hypertonicity. This segment of the nephron is impermeable to NaCl and urea, thus the osmolality of luminal fluid in the most distal portion of the loop approaches that of the interstitium. The thin ascending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to NaCl, which diffuses down its concentration gradient into the interstitium (Figure 3 .2-1, F ). As previously mentioned, this segment is also permeable to urea, and some interstitial urea enters the tubule lumen by diffusion down its concentration gradient. Luminal fluid entering the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is thus hypotonic to the interstitium.",

            "text": "Increased urine flow may be induced by solute or water diuresis (Box 3.2-1). Solute diuresis results in increased urine flow because of excessive renal excretion of a nonreabsorbed solute such as glucose or sodium. During solute diuresis, the urine osmolality is equal to or higher than the plasma osmolality. Primary renal insufficiency or failure (33% or fewer intact nephrons) result in solute diuresis, because each functional nephron must filter an increased amount of solute to maintain daily obligatory solute excretion. Fractional clearances of solutes such as Na, K, and Cl therefore appropriately increase. Solute diuresis caused by glucosuria occurs in hyperglycemic horses when the maximal renal reabsorptive capacity for glucose is exceeded (180 to 200 mg/dl). 18 Solute diuresis caused by glucosuria has been reported in horses with pituitary adenoma and in a hyperglycemic horse with bilateral granulosa cell tumors. 19, 20 Primary diabetes mellitus, a common cause of hyperglycemia and glucosuria in other species, is uncommon in the horse, although type 2 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in a 15-year-old Quarter Horse mare. 21 Primary renal tubular glucosuria caused by a defect in proximal tubular glucose reabsorption (as is seen in Basenji dogs with Fanconi-like syndrome) 15 has not been reported in horses. Psychogenic salt consumption also has been reported to cause solute diuresis in a horse. 22 Postobstructive solute diuresis is not diagnosed commonly in horses because nephrolithiasis and ureterolithiasis are uncommon; when they occur, the condition is often bilateral and associated with chronic renal failure, and treatment is usually unsuccessful. 23, 24 Decreased water resorption in the collecting tubules or inappropriately large voluntary water intake causes water diuresis. The osmolality of the urine during water diuresis is less than that of plasma. Water diuresis may be caused by insufficient ADH secretion, insensitivity of the receptors of the distal collecting duct and collecting tubules to the action of ADH, renal medullary solute washout, or apparent psychogenic polydipsia. Insufficient secretion of ADH (central diabetes insipidus) may be associated with adenoma of the pars intermedia of horses but has never been documented 25 and with head trauma and potassium depletion in other species. A case of idiopathic central diabetes insipidus was reported in a Welsh pony. 26 Insensitivity of collecting duct receptors to ADH may occur during endotoxemia and hyperadrenocorticism (glucocorticoid excess associated with tumors of the pars intermedia). In other species, potassium depletion, hypercalcemia, and the administration of certain drugs (including gentamicin) have been reported to cause insensitivity of the collecting duct receptors to ADH. 15 Congenital diabetes insipidus also has been reported in other species. 26 True nephrogenic diabetes insipidus implies isolated dysfunction of response to ADH by collecting tubules that are not associated with other structural or metabolic lesions of the kidney. The occurrence of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in two sibling Thoroughbred colts has suggested that the condition might be heritable in some horses. 27 Renal medullary washout (loss of medullary Na, with pyometra, hypoadrenocorticism (chronic renal sodium loss), chronic liver disease (increased aldosterone concentration promotes sodium retention, smaller daily load of urea for excretion caused by decreased conversion of ammonia to urea), primary polycythemia, hypercalcemia, and potassium depletion in other species. 15",

Verification of 24-hour urine volume and water intake should be undertaken for horses suspected of having polyuria and polydipsia that do not display obvious polyuria (frequent large volume urination and wet stall) and polydipsia (water bucket always empty and overt thirst). Hemogram, serum biochemistries, and urinalysis should be assessed for all horses with polyuria and polydipsia. A hallmark finding in horses with polyuria and polydipsia is a decreased urine specific gravity (USG). Identification of other abnormalities on laboratory tests (e.g., increased blood urea nitrogen or creatinine concentrations, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia) necessitates ruling out the presence of underlying diseases (such as renal insufficiency and adenoma of the pars intermedia of the pituitary) using specialized laboratory tests. The hydration status of horses then should be assessed carefully. Those horses that are dehydrated should be rehydrated judiciously with intravenous fluids, taking care not to overhydrate horses with renal insufficiency. After rehydration, when possible, creatinine clearance should be determined by using a urine collection apparatus to allow 24-hour volumetric urine collection. A creatinine clearance value below the reference range (1.46 to 3.68 ml/min/kg) 28 suggests that renal insufficiency with decreased glomerular filtration rate and solute diuresis are likely present. A creatinine clearance within the reference range indicates that central diabetes insipidus (CDI), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), or apparent psychogenic polydypsia (APP) is present. To distinguish among these differential diagnoses, an exogenous ADH challenge test should be performed (see the subsequent discussion).",

Diuresis is associated with increased tubular flow rates and inability to resorb sodium and urea adequately from the tubular lumen. Enhanced medullary blood flow may deplete medullary solute further. Water diuresis also has been reported in association An evaluation of a response to the administration of exogenous ADH is indicated for horses that do not concentrate their urine adequately during water deprivation testing, for horses that require rehydration and subsequently demonstrate creatinine clearance values within reference ranges, and for rehydrated horses for which creatinine clearance determinations are impractical. Two regimens for exogenous ADH administration have been reported: 40 to 80 IU ADH as Pitressin tannate in oil intramuscularly 32 or 0.25 IU/kg aqueous or repository ADH intramuscularly. A few reports of responses of horses to exogenous ADH administration have been made, and the following recommendations are based on clinical experience. A positive response to exogenous ADH (USG >1.020) confirms the diagnosis of CDI. A negative response (USG <1.020) implies that NDI or APP plus MSW is present. 31 MSW may result in a decreased USG despite the presence of adequate ADH. A partial water deprivation test should result in an increase in USG in horses with APP plus MSW but should have no effect on horses with true NDI or insensitivity of collecting duct receptors to ADH. The horse is allowed to consume its normal diet and water ad libitum. Voluntary water consumption is monitored closely for 3 to 4 days to establish a baseline. Water available to the horse then is decreased by 5% to 10% of the baseline voluntary intake. Water should be offered in aliquots several times a day to prevent the horse from consuming most of the water in a short time. Water intake should never be restricted below maintenance requirements (about 40 ml/kg/day). During water restriction, the horse is allowed to eat its regular diet. The horse should be weighed daily if possible and should be observed carefully for signs of dehydration (prolonged capillary refill time, increasing heart rate, prolonged skin tenting, and hypernatremia). Moderate water restriction in the face of continued intake of dietary solutes facilitates reestablishment of the corticomedullary osmotic gradient. 15 Results of partial water deprivation tests in horses have been reported infrequently.",

Pituitary adenoma should be considered in horses with compatible clinical signs (hirsutism, weight loss, and laminitis) and supporting laboratory data (hyperglycemia and failure of suppression of cortisol production by dexamethasone). 33 Medullary washout may be a more common complication of primary diseases and their therapy in horses than has been reported to date.

Compared with plasma, interstitial fluid has a slightly lower concentration of cationic electrolytes, a slightly higher concentration of chloride, and a much lower concentration of protein (1.2 versus 0.2 mOsm/L of water). 2 The amount and function of plasma proteins within the interstitial space are not inconsequential. A constant circulation of plasma proteins occurs between the vascular and interstitial spaces, with about half of the protein circulating every 24 hours in human beings. More than half of the plasma protein content of the body is contained within the interstitial space at any one time. Plasma proteins within the interstitial space are important in the transport of waterinsoluble substances from the vascular space and in resistance to infection. 3 Interstitial fluid is contained within the interstitium, the intercellular connective tissues that lie between the cellular elements of the vascular and cellular compartments of the body. The extracellular tissue of the interstitium, except in the case of bone, consists of a three-dimensional collagen fiber network embedded in a proteoglycan gel matrix. 4 Interstitial water exists as free water and as water within the proteoglycan gel. Normally, only a small proportion of interstitial fluid exists as free water, most of the water being contained in the interstitial gel. However, in edematous states, the proportion of fluid as free water within the interstitium increases. 2 The source of interstitial fluid is the intravascular space. The volume of interstitial fluid is determined by the functional relationships of three major anatomic structures: the capillary, the interstitial space, and the lymphatics. 5 Functionally, the volume of fluid that accumulates in the interstitium is determined by the rate of ingress of fluid from the vascular space, the compliance of the interstitium, and the rate at which fluid is evacuated from the interstitium. The net rate of ingress of fluid from capillaries into the interstitium is determined by a number of factors acting across the capillary membrane, the effects of which are related by Starling's equation:",

The lymphatics represent the only means by which interstitial protein is returned to the circulation. Interstitial fluid, and with it protein, moves down a pressure gradient into lymphatic capillaries through clefts between the lymphatic endothelial cells. Lymphatic endothelial cells are supported, and the lymphatic capillaries maintained patent, by anchoring filaments that attach the endothelial cells to surrounding connective tissue. Lymphatic fluid progresses centripetally through progressively larger vessels before draining into the great veins of the chest. Lymphatic valves prevent the retrograde flow of fluid from the lymphatics. Lymph is propelled by factors extrinsic to the lymphatics, including muscle activity, active and passive motion, posture, respiration, and blood vessel pulsation. Exercise causes a significant increase in lymph flow, at least in part because of the increase in tissue pressure that is associated with muscle contraction, although passive motion also increases lymph flow. Standing results in significant diminution or cessation of lymph flow from, and the prompt accumulation of interstitial fluid in, the lower extremities of human beings. In addition to the extrinsic factors affecting lymph flow, coordinated contractions of lymphatic vessels contribute substantially to the centripetal flow of lymph. 12",

Increases in capillary hydrostatic pressure, decreases in plasma oncotic pressure, and increases in interstitial oncotic pressure all favor increased fluid filtration. Conversely, increased interstitial hydrostatic pressure and decreased interstitial oncotic pressure act to inhibit fluid filtration. Box 3.3-1 lists the fundamental mechanisms of accumulation of excessive interstitial fluid. Increases in capillary hydrostatic pressure, which occur with venous obstruction or arteriolar dilation, such as that associated with inflammation, increase net fluid efflux. The edema that occurs with congestive heart failure likely has an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure as one of its causes, although the mechanism is complex. 13 Posture also affects capillary hydrostatic pressure; capillaries below the level of the heart have higher hydrostatic pressures than do capillaries above the level of the heart.",

A decrease in plasma oncotic pressure decreases the oncotic gradient that favors movement of fluid into the capillary. Consequently, the capillary hydrostatic pressure, which favors filtration, predominates and fluid accumulates in the interstitium. Plasma oncotic pressure decreases when plasma protein concentration declines. Albumin is the plasma protein that exerts the preponderance of the oncotic force 8 ; therefore clinically, edema often is associated with hypoalbuminemia. An increase in the permeability of the capillary membrane greatly increases fluid and protein transport into the interstitium and decreases the ability of the membrane to maintain a difference in oncotic pressure between the plasma and the interstitium. 5 Capillary permeability increases when the endothelium is damaged, such as by vasculitis or inflammatory reactions. Lymphatic obstruction prevents the removal of interstitial fluid and protein. Filtration of fluid and passage of small amounts of protein into the interstitial space continues in the presence of lymphatic obstruction. The interstitial fluid is reabsorbed by the capillaries; however, the protein is not. Consequently, the protein content of the interstitial fluid gradually increases, with a resultant increase in interstitial oncotic pressure that favors filtration of fluid. The increased interstitial oncotic pressure causes fluid to accumulate in the interstitium, thus exacerbating the edema. 2 Alterations in the magnitude of one or more of Starling's forces may be offset by compensatory changes in lymph flow and other of Starling's forces. In concert, Starling's forces and lymph flow act as \"edema safety factors\" to prevent the excess accumulation of interstitial fluid and development of frank edema. For example, lymph flow increases with the increased filtration associated with increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. Thus a larger volume of fluid enters and is removed from the interstitial space. The interstitial protein concentration decreases as increased fluid flow washes protein out of the interstitial space. Reduced interstitial space protein concentration increases the oncotic gradient, inhibiting fluid efflux from the capillary, and decreases the rate of movement of fluid from the capillary to the interstitial space. 6",

These abnormalities may result in lowered concentrations of serum albumin, liver-dependent clotting factors (factors II, VII, IX, and X), and total plasma or serum protein. Lowered circulating proteins (especially albumin) may result in decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure and thus may manifest as peripheral dependent edema in the distal limbs, pectoral region, and ventral midline.

The author argues that those ponies that had greater feed conversion efficiency would have been stronger, had longer lives, and been more available for breeding. Current illustrations of this theory may lie in the Welsh and Connemara pony breeds that still thrive and flourish in the wild in the inhospitable north Atlantic climates of the western coasts of Wales and Ireland, respectively.",

Such foals often have pendulous, bloated abdomens that ballotte more easily than do the abdomens of adult horses with accumulation of fluid. Abdominal fluid actually may smell like urine, and peritoneal fluid creatinine concentrations will be highoften more than twice those of peripheral blood.

A ruptured urinary bladder abscess should be suspected in a foal with sepsis that initially responds to therapy for sepsis and then, several days later, has acute-onset depression, anorexia, ileus, and abdominal distention. Adults horses rarely have uroperitoneum; however, uroperitoneum has been associated with ruptured urinary bladders during stressful parturition in mares that manifest mild postpartum abdominal pain and abdominal distention. 12, 13 Fetal hydrops results from an accumulation of excessive amounts of fluid within the amnion (hydrops amnion) or chorioallantois (hydrops allantois). 14 Hydrops results in a bilaterally pendulous abdomen in a late-term pregnant mare. A rapid accumulation of fluid over 10 to 14 days may makes walking or perhaps even breathing difficult for the mare. A diagnosis may be made after taking history and performing a rectal examination, although palpating the fetus is usually difficult because the excess fluid causes the uterus to descend out of reach of the examiner.

Such an examination must be performed percutaneously in late gestation. Ultrasonography can determine the location of increased abdominal fluid (intrauterine or extrauterine) and the health status of the fetus. Percutaneous placement of base-apex electrocardiographic leads across the abdomen of the mare may help to document that the fetus is still viable if an ultrasound examination does not produce definitive evidence (heart movement or gross fetal movement). 15 Cardiac ultrasonography may help to document the presence of a cardiac valvular defect that can be the cause of ascites in a horse with heart failure. Abdominal radiography may assist in the diagnosis of abdominal distention caused by intestinal obstruction in a foal or miniature horse. Percutaneous ultrasound examination also may assist in documenting the source of abdominal distention (e.g., intussusception) in smaller horses or foals 16, 17 and in characterizing umbilical and urachal abnormalities. 17 Complete blood counts and plasma fibrinogen concentrations assist in diagnosing inflammatory conditions such as infectious peritonitis. Urachal or urinary bladder abscesses also may be associated with inflammatory leukograms. Blood or peritoneal fluid cultures may assist in documenting the offending bacterial agent(s). Foals or adults with uroperitoneum have elevated serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium and decreased serum sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate concentrations. 10, 11 Abdominocentesis should be attempted to distinguish the cause of ascites. Care must be taken, however, in obtaining peritoneal fluid from late-term pregnant mares to avoid penetrating directly into the distended uterus. Analysis of peritoneal fluid reveals abdominal fluid to be a transudate (equivocal infection) or exudate (probable infection). 6, 7 Fluid should be cultured aerobically and anaerobically when infectious peritonitis is suspected. Exfoliative cytologic examination rarely may document the presence of neoplastic cells. 8, 9 Peritoneal fluid creatinine concentration approaches or often exceeds (more than twice) that of serum if uroperitoneum is present. 10, 11 Serum and peritoneal urea nitrogen concentrations are less reliable for such a diagnosis because the peritoneal membrane does not differentially sequester urea nitrogen (but does creatinine) within the abdominal cavity.

In this section, the term dysphagia is used in the broader sense to describe problems with eating. Dysphagia can result from a number of disorders affecting any part of the upper gastrointestinal system (oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus). Clinical signs of dysphagia vary depending on the cause and the location of the problem but may include ptyalism (excessive salivation), gagging, dropping food, nasal discharge, and coughing. Dysphagia can result from morphologic or functional disorders. The causes of these diseases may be acquired or congenital. Morphologic causes of dysphagia include abnormal anatomy, obstruction of the upper gastrointestinal tract, inflammation, and pain. Examples of anatomic abnormalities include a cleft palate and subepiglottic cysts. 3, 4 Obstruction of the upper gastrointestinal tract most commonly includes feed impactions of the esophagus but also can include pharyngeal obstructions secondary to retropharyngeal lymph node masses or severe guttural pouch tympany. 5-10 Inflammatory conditions resulting in pain and dysphagia include periodontal diseases, foreign bodies, pharyngitis, epiglottitis, and mandibular or maxillary fractures. 3, 6 Functional disorders resulting in dysphagia include neurologic, neuromuscular, and muscular diseases. Functional disorders frequently result in problems with swallowing but less commonly involve mastication and prehension and rarely occur with esophageal transport. Neurologic diseases resulting in dysphagia may be peripheral or central. Peripheral neurologic problems frequently result from abnormalities of the guttural pouch but also can include toxic peripheral neuropathies, such as lead toxicity. Problems of the guttural pouch include infection (tympany, empyema, or mycosis), iatrogenic problems (infusion of caustic substances), and trauma (rupture of the longus capitis muscle from the basisphenoid bone and hemorrhage into the guttural pouch). 2, 11, 12 Central neurologic diseases may result in problems in prehension, mastication, or swallowing. Specific examples include equine protozoal myelitis, viral encephalitis (rabies and eastern and western encephalitis), toxic neuropathies (leukoencephalomalacia and nigropallidal encephalomalacia), and cerebral trauma. 1,2,7,13-15 Neuromuscular problems resulting in dysphagia generally present as a systemic disease and include diseases such as botulism and organophosphate toxicity. 1, 2, 16, 17 Muscular diseases resulting in dysphagia are rare but include nutritional muscular dystrophy (white muscle disease) in foals. 18 ",

Problems with prehension generally suggest a primary neurologic problem. Watching the horse try to graze and eat hay or grain may be necessary. Ingestion of yellow star thistle or Russian knapweed results in basal ganglia lesions (nigropallidal encephalomalacia). Horses with these lesions are unable to prehend food (with lack of coordination of the lips and tongue), but they can swallow. 14 Their ability to drink water should be evaluated carefully, because some horses continue to drink despite having difficulty in swallowing. Horses that expel food while chewing may have problems with mastication. Coughing and nasal discharge indicate aspiration of food into the trachea. Problems with swallowing or regurgitation may cause aspiration. Esophageal obstruction results in regurgitation of food through the nares. Regurgitation often is observed during feeding but may occur shortly after or even hours after feeding. Ptyalism, without dysphagia, may result from ingestion of legume plants (especially second-cutting red clover) contaminated with Rhizoctonia leguminicola. This fungus produces a mycotoxin called slaframine, which has parasympathomimetic properties. 19 The excess salivation disappears once the animal stops feeding on the plant. ",

The passing of a nasogastric tube, endoscopic examination, and radiographs (if necessary) are other diagnostic tests that may help to identify the anatomic localization and cause of dysphagia. Complete obstruction of the esophagus can be excluded if a nasogastric tube is passed successfully into the stomach. Feed impactions of the esophagus are common in horses. Esophageal impactions of feed may occur because of poor mastication or esophageal strictures or diverticulum. [5] [6] [7] The most common sites for obstructions occur in the cranial esophagus, at the thoracic inlet, and at the base of the heart. 7 Other esophageal abnormalities include rupture, fistula, cyst, megaesophagus, and neoplasms. 5, 20 An endoscopic examination allows visualization of the nasal passageways, nasopharynx, guttural pouches, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. Inflammation of the pharynx, larynx, or esophagus is assessed best by endoscopic examination. Partial obstructions of the pharynx often result in dyspnea, especially during exercise, and sometimes can cause dysphagia. Retropharyngeal masses, guttural pouch tympany, and rarely neoplasms may result in pharyngeal obstruction and collapse. 2, 9, 10 Depending on the length of the endoscope available, the clinician can evaluate all or part of the esophagus for inflammation or obstruction.",

            "text": "Cerebral disease usually manifests as seizures, head pressing, wandering, depression, and changes in mentation. Brainstem function can be assessed by cranial nerve examination. Evaluation of an abnormal response of the cranial nerves should establish the location of the problem within the brainstem. For example, the optic nerve can be assessed by the menace response (requiring the facial nerve) and by the pupillary light reflex (requiring the oculomotor nerve). Abnormalities of the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves manifest as strabismus or lack of a pupillary light reflex. Facial nerve paralysis (ear, eyelid, and muzzle droop) and vestibular disease (circling, nystagmus, and head tilt) often occur together because of the close proximity of these nerves as they exit the brainstem. 21 Endoscopic examination is a valuable tool to determine if pharyngeal or laryngeal paralysis is present. These problems may be caused by peripheral or central diseases. The dorsolateral wall of the medial compartment of the guttural pouch contains a plexus of nerves, including the glossopharyngeal nerve; branches of the vagus, spinal accessory, and hypoglossal nerves; and the cranial cervical ganglion. Mycotic plaques, empyema, and trauma (hematoma) of the guttural pouch can result in pharyngeal paralysis, dorsal displacement of the soft palate, laryngeal hemiplegia, and occasionally Horner's syndrome. 1, 2, 11, 12, 21 The clinician should obtain skull radiographs in many horses with dysphagia, and they are especially helpful when traumatic injuries are suspected. Rupture of the longus capitis muscle results in ventral deviation of the dorsal pharynx and narrowing of the nasopharynx. Bony fragments may be evident ventral to the basisphenoid bones in these horses. 12 Otitis media and pathologic fracture of the petrous temporal bone frequently result in vestibular disease and facial nerve paralysis and occasionally in glossopharyngeal and vagus nerve involvement. An endoscopic examination of the guttural pouches is helpful with this problem, because the distal stylohyoid bone is thickened and irregular. Ventrodorsal, lateral, and rostrolateral oblique radiographs also may reveal osseous changes of the stylohyoid bone, tympanic bulla, or petrous temporal bone. 21 The clinical examination should include an evaluation of gait. Signs of ataxia, generalized weakness, and hypermetria along with cranial nerve signs may be observable with brainstem involvement. The clinician should evaluate the horse at the walk, trot, down an incline, over a step, and backing and turning in tight circles. The clinician may wish to place the feet of the horse in abnormal positions and determine if the horse can reposition the leg correctly in a reasonable time. Generalized weakness (without ataxia) may manifest with a decrease in tail, eyelid, and tongue tone and muscle fasciculations. Weakness generally suggests a neuromuscular (botulism, organophosphate poisoning) or muscular problem. [16] [17] [18] Equine lower motor neuron disease results in generalized weakness and weight loss; however, horses are not dysphagic and do not exhibit cranial nerve abnormalities. 22 Ataxia or hypermetria along with dysphagia suggests a diffuse or multifocal disease that affects the spinal cord and brainstem. Examples of such diseases include equine protozoal myelitis, rabies, equine herpes myeloencephalopathy, polyneuritis equi, and a migrating parasite. 12, 23, 24 Further diagnostic tests are indicated in these cases, such as an evaluation of spinal fluid for cytologic abnormalities and chemistry and Western blot analysis for antibodies to Sarcocystis neurona. 25 Grass sickness, a disease found in Great Britain and in other northern European countries, results in ileus and colic. Grass sickness can result in dysphagia, with problems in swallowing or esophageal transport. 26 Grass sickness is regarded as a fatal disease, resulting in ileus of the gastrointestinal tract, dysphagia, and weight loss, which most likely is caused by an unidentified neurotoxin. Grass sickness can be defined as a dysautonomia characterized by pathologic lesions in autonomic ganglia, enteric plexi, and specific nuclei in the central nervous system. 27 Additional information about the specific causes of dysphagia are covered elsewhere in this text.",

The clinical signs of respiratory distress vary with the severity and origin of impaired gas exchange. Clinical signs commonly observed in horses with respiratory distress include flared nostrils, exercise intolerance, inactivity, exaggerated abdominal effort, abnormal respiratory noise (stridor), anxious expression, extended head and neck, cyanosis, and synchronous pumping of the anus with the respiratory cycle. 1 Horses with chronic respiratory distress may develop a heave line resulting from hypertrophy of the cutaneous trunci and abdominal muscles, which assist during forced expiration. 3 Respiratory distress usually results from inefficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide caused by primary pulmonary disease, airway obstruction, or impairment of the muscles and supporting structures necessary for ventilation. In some cases, ventilation increases in the absence of impaired gas exchange in response to pain, metabolic acidosis, or high environmental temperature. Familiarity with the mechanics of breathing and control of ventilation in healthy and diseased lungs facilitates the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory distress. 3, 4 ",

Central chemoreceptors respond predominantly to hypercapnia, whereas peripheral chemoreceptors respond to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Central chemoreceptors, located in the ventral medulla, monitor alterations in the pH of intracerebral interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid. The blood-brain barrier is impermeable to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions but is freely permeable to carbon dioxide. Therefore acidification of the intracerebral interstitial fluid and stimulation of the central chemoreceptors occur predominantly in response to hypercapnia. The severity of acidosis in the intracerebral interstitial fluid caused by hypercapnia is amplified by two features of the central nervous system: (1) hypercapnia produces cerebral vasodilation, increasing the delivery of CO 2 to the central nervous system, and (2) cerebrospinal fluid has poor buffering capacity because of low total protein concentrations. 2 Peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the arterial circulation and respond to acidemia, hypercapnia, and hypoxemia. The carotid bodies are situated at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery, and the aortic bodies are located near the aortic arch. These receptors relay information to the central controller regarding arterial gas tensions via the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. Their responsiveness to alterations in PaCO 2 is less consequential than the central chemoreceptors; however, the peripheral chemoreceptors are solely responsible for the hypoxic ventilatory drive. The peripheral chemoreceptors demonstrate a nonlinear response to low arterial oxygen tension. They are insensitive to alterations in PaO 2 above 100 mm Hg, exhibit moderate response to arterial O 2 tensions between 50 and 100 mm Hg, and demonstrate a dramatic increase in responsiveness when the partial pressure of oxygen falls below 50 mm Hg in the arterial circulation. 2 The respiratory pattern elicited by hypoxia differs from that stimulated by hypercapnia. 5, 6 Hypoxia evokes an increase in respiratory frequency, whereas hypercapnia triggers an elevation in tidal volume. In addition, hypoxia stimulates recruitment of the inspiratory muscles, whereas hypercapnia potentiates the activity of inspiratory and expiratory muscles.",

Production of histamine, prostaglandins, and other inflammatory mediators increases in horses with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). [10] [11] [12] Stimulation of irritant receptors by these inflammatory mediators may be responsible in part for bronchoconstriction, mucus production, and tachypnea observed in horses with allergic airway disease. In addition to their role as chemoreceptors, irritant receptors also function as mechanoreceptors. 1 An abrupt change in end-expiratory lung volume, such as occurs with pneumothorax or pleural effusion, produces a tachypneic breathing pattern attributed to stimulation of irritant receptors. Juxtacapillary receptors are believed to be located within the wall of the alveolus. Stimulation by increased interstitial fluid volume triggers the sensation of difficult breathing. 2 Nonmyelinated C fibers are located in the pulmonary parenchyma, conducting airways, and blood vessels. These receptors respond to pulmonary edema, congestion, and inflammatory mediators, and stimulation activates a tachypneic breathing pattern. In addition, C fiber receptors may stimulate the release of pulmonary neuropeptides, which produce bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, protein extravasation, and cytokine production. 1 Increased negative pressure (upper airway obstruction) within the airway stimulates mechanoreceptors of the larynx and produces prolongation of inspiratory time and activation of upper airway dilator muscles. 13 ",

The single most important muscle required for the inspiratory phase of the respiratory cycle is the diaphragm. Contraction of the diaphragm forces the abdominal contents back, increasing the length of the thoracic cavity, and pulls the ribs abaxially, increasing the width of the abdominal cavity. In addition, the external intercostal muscles participate in inspiration by pulling the ribs abaxially to increase the width of the thoracic cavity. The net effect is an increase in the size of the thoracic cavity, producing subatmospheric intrathoracic pressure, to drive inspiration and pulmonary inflation. Expiration at rest is a passive process in most species and relies on elastic recoil of the lung to create positive intrathoracic pressure. 14 In horses, the first portion of expiration relies on elastic recoil of the lung to the point of relaxation volume, whereby the tendency for pulmonary collapse equals the tendency for expansion by the thoracic wall. However, horses further decrease lung volume by active compression of the chest wall, through contraction of the internal intercostal muscles and muscles of the abdominal wall. 15 Conversely, the first part of inhalation is passive until the relaxation volume is reached, at which point the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles complete the inspiratory phase. Mechanical (abdominal distention, trauma to the thoracic wall) and neuromuscular (botulism, phrenic nerve damage, nutritional muscular dystrophy) dysfunction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles prevent expansion of the thoracic wall and produce hypoventilation, hypoxemia, and respiratory distress. 4 Horses with torsion of the large colon develop significant abdominal distention and respiratory distress. Respiratory failure caused by impaired diaphragmatic function plays an important role in the pathophysiology and mortality associated with this intestinal accident.",

Patients with V-Q mismatch often have a normal arterial PCO 2 . The ventilatory drive to maintain normal PaCO 2 is powerful. Because the CO 2 dissociation curve is basically a straight line (direct relationship), increased ventilation efficiently decreases PaCO 2 at high and low V-Q ratios. Because the nearly flat shape of the O 2 dissociation curve, increasing ventilation is inefficient for proportionally increasing the arterial PO 2 .

Physiologic shunting is defined as perfusion of nonventilated or collapsed regions of the lung and occurs with pulmonary consolidation, atelectasis, and edema. Congenital heart disease, such as tetralogy of Fallot and some cardiac septal defects, is an example of a direct right-to-left shunt wherein unoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart is added to oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart. In these conditions, hypoxemia cannot be abolished by increasing the oxygen content of inspired air. The shunted blood is never exposed to the higher concentration of inspired oxygen in the alveolus, and the addition of a small amount of shunted blood with its low O 2 content greatly reduces the PO 2 of arterial blood. Compared with breathing room air, the decrement in PO 2 is much greater at PO 2 levels associated with the inhalation of O 2 -enriched air because the O 2 dissociation curve is so flat at high PO 2 levels. Only hypoxemia caused by right-to-left shunting behaves in this manner when the patient is permitted to inspire high percentages of oxygen (70% to 100%). Shunts do not usually cause hypercapnia. 23 Chemoreceptors detect excess arterial CO 2 , and ventilation increases to reduce the content of CO 2 in unshunted blood until arterial PCO 2 reaches the normal range. In some cases of shunt, the arterial PCO 2 is below normal because of hyperventilation stimulated by the hypoxemic ventilatory drive.",

Horses with pleuropneumonia, for example, may develop hypoxemia caused by hypoventilation (extrapulmonary restriction by pleural effusion), V-Q mismatch (accumulation of exudate and edema within alveoli and conducting airways), and diffusion impairment (exudate and edema within the interstitial spaces).",

In addition, approximately 80% of the total airway resistance to air flow is located in the upper airway. 25 A 50% decrease in the radius of an airway increases its resistance by sixteenfold (Poiseuille's law). 14 Therefore small changes in the upper airway diameter dramatically affect the overall resistance to air flow and work of breathing for the horse. Extrathoracic airway pressures are subatmospheric during inspiration; therefore poorly supported structures in the upper airway narrow or collapse during inspiration (dynamic collapse). The most common cause of non-fixed upper airway obstruction in horses is laryngeal hemiplegia, which produces inspiratory stridor during exercise. Intraluminal masses and arytenoid chondritis cause fixed upper airway obstruction and produce inspiratory and expiratory respiratory distress. 3 Twenty percent of the total airway resistance is attributable to the small airways. 25 Although the radius of individual bronchioles is small, many of them exist and the sum or collective radius is large, with the result that their overall contribution to pulmonary resistance is low. 23 Because the resistance of the bronchioles is low, advanced disease must be present for routine measurements of airway resistance to detect an abnormality, and obstruction of these airways must be extensive before a horse would suffer from respiratory distress. During pulmonary inflation, intrathoracic pressures are subatmospheric. Small airways are pulled open by negative intrathoracic pressure and stretched parenchymal attachments at high lung volumes. Thus resistance to air flow in small airways is low during the inspiratory phase of respiration. 24 During exhalation, intrathoracic pressure is positive and the diameter of small airways is decreased, and bronchioles may even close at low lung volumes. Therefore resistance to air flow in small airways is greatest during the expiratory phase. In horses with COPD, the airway diameter is reduced by inflammatory exudate, edema, and bronchoconstriction. 16, 17 As lung volume decreases during expiration, the narrowed bronchioles are compressed shut (dynamic airway collapse) and trap air distal to the site of closure. 4 This is an example of severe flow limitation, which may lead ultimately to the development of emphysema. Flow limitation forces horses with COPD to breathe at higher lung volumes and maintain a higher functional residual capacity to reduce or avoid dynamic airway collapse. Affected horses attempt to reduce the end-expiratory lung volume by recruiting abdominal muscles to increase the intrathoracic pressures during expiration. However, the greater the end-expiratory pressure, the greater is the likelihood of small airway compression and collapse. Hypertrophy of the cutaneous trunci and expiratory abdominal muscles, especially the external abdominal oblique, produces the characteristic heave line associated with COPD. 4 Because dynamic airway narrowing and collapse occurs during exhalation, wheezes are loudest at end expiration in horses with COPD. 16, 17 ",

The characteristic respiratory pattern in horses with restrictive pulmonary disease is rapid, shallow respiration at low lung volumes. 4 This strategy takes advantage of high pulmonary compliance at low lung volumes and decreases the work of breathing. This respiratory pattern has the disadvantage of increased ventilation of anatomic dead space. 26 Restrictive diseases may be classified as intrapulmonary (pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis, 27 and interstitial pneumonia 28, 29 ) and extrapulmonary (pleural effusion, pneumothorax, mediastinal mass, botulism, and nutritional muscular dystrophy). 4 Hypoxemia observed in horses with intrapulmonary restrictive disease is attributed to V-Q mismatch and diffusion impairment. Stimulation of juxtacapillary receptors may contribute to respiratory distress observed in these patients. 26 The pathophysiologic mechanism for hypoxemia in horses with extrapulmonary restriction is hypoventilation. 4 In cases of pleural effusion and pneumothorax, respiratory distress is likely to be exacerbated by thoracic pain.",

Percussion of the thoracic wall generates a resonant and hollow sound when performed over regions of normal lung. Pleural effusion and pulmonary consolidation sound dull and flat during thoracic percussion, whereas pneumothorax produces a hyperresonant sound. 31 Normal air flow occurs in laminar flow; therefore normal horses at rest do not generate easily audible sounds. 4 Respiratory sounds are generated from vibration in tissue and sudden changes in pressure of gas moving within the airway lumen. Airway narrowing and exudate generate audible sounds by creating disturbances in laminar flow, turbulence, and sudden changes in pressure of moving gas. 14 Crackles are intermittent or explosive sounds, generated by bubbling of air through secretions or by equilibration of airway pressures after sudden opening of collapsed small airways. The generation of crackles requires an air-fluid interface, and these abnormal lung sounds occur in horses with pneumonia, interstitial fibrosis, COPD, pulmonary edema, and atelectasis. 4 Wheezes are continuous, musical sounds that originate from oscillation of small airway walls before complete closing (expiratory wheeze) or opening (inspiratory wheeze). 14 Expiratory wheezes are the hallmark of obstructive pulmonary disease. 24 Arterial blood gas determination provides a quantitative evaluation of pulmonary function, alveolar ventilation, and acid-base status and may identify the origin of respiratory distress (hypercapnia, hypoxemia, or acidemia). 22 The clinician may determine the pathophysiologic mechanism of hypoxemia by examining the PaCO 2 level and by investigating the response of PaO 2 to supplemental oxygen therapy. In addition, serial blood gas monitoring can determine response to bronchodilator, parasympathomimetic, or antiinflammatory therapy.",

The findings during thoracic auscultation and percussion are valuable in determining indication for ultrasonography versus radiography. Pulmonary consolidation, abscessation, fibrosis, interstitial pneumonia, peribronchial infiltration, and mediastinal mass are differentiated and diagnosed readily via thoracic radiography. Thoracic ultrasonography is superior to radiography in detecting and characterizing pleural fluid and peripheral pulmonary abscessation and consolidation in horses. Air reflects the ultrasound beam; therefore ultrasonography does not image deep pulmonary lesions if the overlying lung is aerated. 32 An endoscopic examination of the upper airway is indicated in horses with inspiratory stridor and suspected upper airway obstruction. 33 Horses with extreme respiratory distress may resent endoscopic examination, and forced examination may precipitate a respiratory crisis. Atropine administration in horses with COPD may provide rapid relief of respiratory distress, if the major component of airway obstruction is reversible bronchoconstriction. Horses that respond to an atropine challenge likely will respond favorably to bronchodilator therapy. Incomplete response to atropine in horses with COPD indicates that exudate or fibrosis is contributing to airway obstruction, and limited response to bronchodilator therapy is anticipated. 16 ",

            "text": "The cough cycle has four phases: inspiration, compression, expression, and relaxation. 1 Deep inspiration, which immediately precedes cough, increases lung volume. As lung volume increases, the ability to generate maximum expiratory airflow increases because of the greater force of contraction achieved by the muscles of respiration when their precontraction length increases and because of the greater elastic recoil pressure of the lung at high lung value. 3 Thus precough expansion of lung volume maximizes the velocity of expiratory airflow. Achievement of maximum expiratory airflow rates requires a relatively gentle expiratory effort, and airflow maxima are therefore independent of effort. 2 After deep inspiration, the glottis closes. While the glottis remains closed, compression of the chest cavity occurs by contraction of the thoracic and abdominal musculature during an active expiratory effort. Compression of the chest results in an increase in pleural pressure from 50 to 100 mm Hg. 2 This increase in pleural pressure is transmitted to pressure in the intrathoracic airways and trachea. Intraalveolar pressures actually exceed intrapleural pressures by an amount equal to the elastic recoil pressure of the lung. 4 Expression occurs when the glottis opens abruptly, thus producing a gradient in airway pressure (atmospheric at the pharynx and high in the alveoli), and air is expired forcefully. The occurrence of dynamic airway compression in larger airways maximizes the velocity of airflow toward the mouth (Figure 3.8-1) . The intraairway pressures vary in the respiratory system according to the instantaneous transpulmonary pressure. 3 At the equal pressure point, the airway pressure equals the pleural pressure. Toward the mouth from the equal pressure point (downstream), the pleural pressure is greater than intrathoracic airway pressure, and the intrathoracic airways therefore are compressed dynamically. Partial collapse of the airways downstream of the equal pressure point maximizes airflow velocities in these airways by decreasing their diameter. At high lung volumes, the equal pressure point likely is in the larger airways and therefore only the intrathoracic trachea may be subject to dynamic compression and maximal airflow velocity. 4 Maximum airflow velocity produces high shearing forces that dislodge mucus and debris from airway walls, thus facilitating expectoration. Cough is therefore most effective as a defense mechanism for clearing the larger airways in healthy animals. Removal of noxious substances from the smaller peripheral airways depends on the presence of mucus in the airways, and irritants that stimulate cough also may stimulate mucus production. 5 In diseases characterized by increased resistance in small peripheral airways caused by partial obstruction (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), maximal expiratory flow rates are reduced. When small airways are obstructed partially, the equal pressure point moves toward the periphery of the lung during coughing because pressures in airways downstream of the partial obstruction are lower than are pressures in those airways in healthy lungs (see Figure 3 .8-1). This shift in the equal pressure point subjects more peripheral airways to dynamic compression. Coughing is likely to be less effective as a clearance mechanism when obstructive diseases of the small airways are present. Bronchodilator therapy may increase the effectiveness of cough in such patients by increasing expiratory airflow rates. 4 The sound of cough is generated by vibration of laryngeal and pharyngeal structures caused by the rapid expulsion of air immediately after opening of the glottis, 3 by narrowing and deformation of airways, and by vibration of surrounding lung tissue. Variations in the sound of cough most likely relate to the quantity and quality of mucus in the airway. 6 At the end of cough, relaxation occurs. Intrapleural pressure falls, and the muscles of expiration relax. Transient bronchodilation occurs. 1",

Loss of the integrity of the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract is a common feature in many respiratory diseases associated with cough (infectious diseases); however, a cause-and-effect relationship between alterations in respiratory epithelium and cough has not been established. 5 Diseases of the respiratory tract may alter the sensitivity of the cough reflex. 5 For example, viral diseases may increase the responsiveness of cough receptors to stimuli.",

Chronic coughing is exhausting and, especially in foals, may decrease food intake. Paroxysmal or persistent cough may impair respiration. Coughing may have profound effects on the cardiovascular system. During the deep inspiratory phase of cough, the rise in intraabdominal pressure because of contraction of the diaphragm and the fall in intrathoracic pressure combine to aspirate blood from the vena cava to fill the right atrium and ventricle abruptly. 3 Because the pleural pressure decreases, the pulmonary artery pressure also decreases. During the expiratory phase of cough, an initial increase in systemic arterial blood pressure and a simultaneous and commensurate increase in cerebral venous and cerebrospinal fluid pressures occur. However, venous return to the heart soon decreases and within a few heartbeats, filling of the heart and stroke volume decrease. 2,3 Hypotension ensues. Falling arterial blood pressure in the face of high cerebral venous pressures reduces the effective perfusion pressure of the brain. Cerebral hypoperfusion and anoxia may occur. Cough-induced syncope has been reported in human beings 2 and in dogs. 10 In chronic cough, bronchial muscular hypertrophy may develop. Bronchial mucosal edema or emphysema may accompany chronic cough. During cough inspiration, inflammatory debris may be aspirated into previously uncontaminated areas of the lung. Cough in dogs has been associated with pneumothorax (from rupture of preexisting pulmonary bullae) and lung lobe torsion. 11 Rib and vertebral fractures have been reported in human beings with powerful coughs but have not been reported in horses. 2, 3 ",

All methods have in common a systematic and thorough evaluation of the history and physical examination of the patient. To aid the clinician in formulating a rational approach to diagnosis, diseases associated with cough may be grouped according to those characterized by fever (current or historical) and those characterized by lack of an elevated body temperature.

A minimum laboratory database for the coughing horse with fever should include the results of a hemogram and a fibrinogen determination. The clinician carefully should auscultate the thorax of the horse in a quiet room with the horse breathing quietly. If the horse is not dyspneic or hypoxemic, the clinician also should undertake auscultation during forced breathing. A plastic bag loosely held over the nostrils of the horse forces the horse to increase tidal volume and respiratory rate. This maneuver causes many horses with exudate in the airways to cough, and deep breathing may be frankly painful for some horses with pleuropneumonia. Auscultation during forced breathing is not necessary in horses with obviously abnormal lung sounds during quiet breathing and is not advisable in horses with pneumonia (especially aspiration pneumonia) or in horses with foreign material in the trachea. Crackles and wheezes heard repeatedly during the inspiratory and early expiratory phases of breathing suggest that pulmonary parenchymal disease is present. Accentuated normal bronchovesicular sounds sometimes are present in horses with pulmonary consolidation, because of referral of sounds from the aerated lung. Absence of lung sounds in dependent portions of the thorax indicates that pulmonary consolidation, atelectasis, or fluid in the pleural cavity may be present. Thoracic percussion and sonographic evaluation are particularly helpful in documenting the presence of fluid in the pleural cavity. Ultrasonography also may show pleural irregularities and superficial parenchymal abscessation, atelectasis, or consolidation. Thoracic radiographs are especially helpful in demonstrating deeper parenchymal disease. Many equine practitioners do not have access to thoracic radiography but can perform thoracic ultrasonography.",

            "text": "Abnormal lung sounds, percussion irregularities, and sonographic evidence of fluid or consolidation are indications for performing transtracheal aspiration (TTA) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). When both procedures are to be performed on the same patient, the clinician should perform TTA first to obtain a sample for culture before the airway is contaminated by the BAL tube. Many practitioners prefer to obtain TTA samples transendoscopically to avoid percutaneous aspiration. Despite the development of guarded culture swabs for transendoscopic use, this technique does not always prevent contamination of lower airway fluid samples. One study demonstrated that Pseudomonas spp. and anaerobic bacteria in cultures of tracheal fluid obtained transendoscopically should be viewed as potential contaminants. 12 Cytologic evaluation of the TTA/BAL, indicating an increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), is consistent with parenchymal disease. Some PMNs may be degenerate. Although some clinicians feel that PMNs may be seen in the tracheal aspirates of normal horses, few PMNs are found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from healthy horses (4.4 \u00b1 3.3 cells to 8.9 \u00b1 1.2 cells/\u00b5l). 13 How well the results of cytologic evaluation of BAL fluids represent the environment of the lower airways is a matter of some debate. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids are harvested from a focal area of the lung. If parenchymal disease is not generalized, bronchoalveolar lavage may miss the diseased region. Results of BAL fluid analysis are normal in some horses with pneumonia and pleuropneumonia. Transtracheal wash fluid consists of secretions from both lungs, and TTA cytologic examination was abnormal in all horses with pneumonia and pleuropneumonia in one study. 14 The prevalence of PMNs in TTA fluid from horses without lower respiratory tract disease has not been determined. The presence of degenerate PMNs and extracellular or intracellular bacteria in TTA/BAL fluid is consistent with the diagnosis of a septic process. The clinician should evaluate a Gram stain to guide the initial choice of antimicrobial agents while awaiting results of culture and sensitivity determinations. Growth of aerobic or anaerobic bacteria in a culture of TTA fluid confirms the presence of bacterial pneumonia if clinical and radiographic findings are also consistent with this disease process. Contamination of cultures of airway secretions obtained via TTA occasionally may occur. Lack of growth of bacterial pathogens from TTA fluid suggests that viral, interstitial, or fungal pneumonia might be present. These possibilities should be investigated by evaluating paired serum samples taken 10 to 14 days apart for influenza virus, equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV1), EHV4, rhinovirus, and equine viral arteritis. Serologic testing for histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis (southwestern United States especially), and possibly mycobacteria should be evaluated. Fungal cultures of tracheal fluid should be evaluated when other more common causes of pneumonia have been ruled out and if the clinical signs of the patient are consistent with this diagnosis. Negative results on serologic tests and fungal cultures in patients with a significant interstitial pattern on thoracic radiographs should prompt consideration of the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia, a condition for which the inciting cause has not been established and for which the prognosis is grave. Percussion, radiographic, or ultrasonic evidence of increased intrapleural fluid is an indication for thoracocentesis. Many horses with bacterial pleuropneumonia have elevated pleural fluid PMN concentrations, and PMNs may be degenerate. Intracellular or extracellular bacteria may be seen on cytologic evaluation. Occasionally, frankly neoplastic cells may be identified in thoracic fluid (usually squamous cells or lymphocytes). Many cytologists are uncomfortable diagnosing thoracic neoplasia based solely on an evaluation of pleural fluid. Thoracic fluid should be cultured aerobically and anaerobically. A positive culture identifies the cause of bacterial pleuritis; however, often pleural fluid cultures may be negative. Cultures of TTA fluid are more likely to be positive in horses with pleuropneumonia, and TTA cultures should be performed routinely for these patients. Primary viral pleuritis, although rare in the author's experience, has been reported in horses, and paired serologic examinations for influenza virus and EHV1/EHV4 may be helpful when cultures are negative. One case of pleuritis caused by Mycoplasma felis has been reported. 15 Culture of pleural fluid and paired serologic examinations for this organism should be performed in patients for which other tests have not proved diagnostic.",

The clinician should attempt to identify the larvae, although this may be difficult. A direct cytologic evaluation of unfixed, unstained, or iodine-stained mucus may be helpful to identify larvae of D. arnfieldi. The clinician should perform a Baermann flotation on feces from the patient and potential reservoir hosts, but the test may not demonstrate ascarid larvae, because pulmonary migration may occur early in the prepatent period. 16 The diagnosis of pulmonary ascarid migration is based on ruling out other causes of pneumonia.",

Heat is lost from body surfaces to the surroundings by several physical mechanisms, including radiation, conduction, and convection. Evaporation is also an important mechanism of heat loss in horses. 3 The rate of sweating controls to some extent the amount of evaporative heat loss. However, even when the animal is not sweating, water evaporates insensibly from the skin and lungs, causing continual heat loss. In horses, evaporative heat loss, primarily though increased sweating but also through increased respiration, becomes more important as the ambient temperature rises and during exercise. 3, 4 In addition to increased heat loss when the body temperature rises, the horse also decreases temperature further by inhibiting means of heat production, such as shivering, and by behavioral responses, such as seeking shade, wind currents, and wading into water.",

Shivering may increase heat production by 4 to 5 times baseline. The primary motor center for shivering is in the posterior hypothalamus, which normally is stimulated by cold signals from the peripheral receptors and to some extent the anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area. Signals from heat sensitive neurons in the anterior-hypothalamic-preoptic area inhibit the center. Digestion of food also contributes to total body heat. Sympathetic stimulation may increase the rate of cellular metabolism, increasing heat production by chemical thermogenesis. Cooling also increases the production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, ultimately increasing thyroid hormones and cellular metabolism, and further contributing to chemical thermogenesis. In addition to these physiologic adaptations, behavioral responses to conserve heat also occur, such as adopting a huddled stance, aggregating in groups, and seeking shelter.",

Now, multiple cytokines are known to act as pyrogens, and a variety of cell types produce them, with monocytes and macrophages predominating. Currently, the following cytokines are thought to be intrinsically pyrogenic in that they produce a rapid-onset fever via direct action on the hypothalamus without requiring formation of another cytokine: interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1) and IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factors (TNF) \u03b1 and \u03b2, interferon\u03b1, and IL-6.

Cytokines that act through this receptor include IL-6, IL-11, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, cardiotropin-1, and leukemic inhibitory factor.

[13] [14] [15] Ablation of the OVLT prevents fever after a peripheral injection of endogenous pyrogens but has no effect when endogenous pyrogens are injected directly into the brain tissue. 14 In the region of the OVLT the blood-brain barrier is minimal, and endothelial cells lining this region may allow direct movement of endogenous pyrogens into the brain or they may release arachidonic acid metabolites in response to endogenous pyrogens, which then move into the brain. The production of arachidonic acid metabolites, particularly prostaglandin E 2 via the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) pathway is clearly important in the pathogenesis of fever, because COX inhibitors, and specifically COX-2 inhibitors, effectively reduce the febrile response but have no effect on the normal body temperature. The prostaglandins do not act directly but initiate neuronal signaling by producing a cascade of changes in cyclic nucleotides, calcium, and monoamines leading to a higher set-point in the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center.",

Arginine vasopressin and \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone act within the brain to decrease fever. [16] [17] [18] [19] When administered to human beings, \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone is a much more potent antipyretic than acetaminophen.

Therefore the onset of fever is accompanied by several hematologic, immunologic, and metabolic changes referred to as the acute phase response. In particular, IL-6 and IL-11 induce the synthesis of acute phase proteins by hepatocytes, including fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, haptoglobin, and others.

In the adult horse absorption occurs predominantly in the large bowel, where a volume of water approximately equal to the total extracellular fluid volume of the animal, or about 100 L, is recovered during the course of the day. Because the large colon is the primary site of water resorption, most significant diarrheal disease in the adult horse involves the colon. In young foals, however, small intestinal disorders such as rotaviral infection also may result in diarrhea. 4 A second critical function of the large bowel is that of microbial digestion of carbohydrates and, to some extent, protein or nonprotein nitrogen. 1-3 Microbial fermentation of carbohydrates in the cecum and colon results primarily in the production of volatile fatty acids, which are absorbed readily, providing up to 75% of the energy requirement of the horse. Therefore maintaining a stable environment for the microbial population is important.

            "text": "Inflammation within the bowel plays a central role in the pathogenesis of diarrhea. Several basic mechanisms of diarrhea have been described, and in most diarrheal diseases, more than one mechanism is involved. These mechanisms include the following: 1. Malabsorption: Malabsorption results from a decrease in the functional absorptive surface area of the gastrointestinal tract. Villus atrophy in the small intestine, seen with rotaviral enteritis and infiltrative bowel disease, can result in malabsorption because of the loss of functional epithelium and maldigestion caused by decreased production of digestive enzymes. A number of insults to the colon result in inflammation and disruption of absorptive cells and tight junctions, leading to decreased absorptive capacity and decreased ability to retain absorbed fluid, that is, increased loss. Several inflammatory mediators, such as histamines and prostaglandins, contribute to the colonic inflammation. These mediators are produced primarily by inflammatory cells in the lamina propria and inhibit absorption through a variety of mechanisms. 6-10 2. Increased secretion: The increased secretion of solutes and water by the inflamed colon can contribute significantly to the development of diarrhea. Although the precise mechanisms of secretion in the equine colon are not understood fully, active secretion and passive fluid loss occur. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Control of active secretion is complex, involving two primary pathways: first, the activation of adenyl cyclase, resulting in an increase of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations, and second, the activation of calcium channels, leading to increased intracellular calcium concentrations. 11, 12 Cyclic adenosine monophosphate and calcium stimulate specific secretory activities, primarily through chloride channels. In some cases of diarrhea, bacterial enterotoxins such as those produced by certain strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella stimulate adenyl cyclase activity, thus increasing active secretion. This is true hypersecretory diarrhea. Also, a number of inflammatory mediators produced by the inflamed colon, particularly prostaglandin E, increase intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and to some extent calcium, thereby increasing active secretion by mucosal cells. [11] [12] [13] Inflammation also enhances passive fluid loss through a number of factors, such as changes in hydrostatic pressure in the colonic capillaries, mucosal damage, and loss of tight junctions. In cases of severe mucosal injury, the loss of protein can decrease vascular oncotic pressure and further potentiate fluid exchange across the endothelium.",

            "text": "Progressive motility must be present for diarrhea to occur. Primary motility disorders causing diarrhea are not well recognized, although diarrhea associated with stress or excitement may represent this phenomenon. Inflammation is known to influence gastrointestinal motility, in addition to altering absorption and secretion. However, the precise significance of the altered motility in the pathogenesis of diarrhea is not clear. Sufficient retention time and thorough mixing are required for digestion and absorption of nutrients and fluid to occur, and decreased intestinal transit time has been recognized in association with many gastrointestinal diseases, including infectious diarrhea. Absorption of endotoxin and the release of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins, disrupts normal motility patterns. 14 In some cases of acute colitis, a period of ileus may occur without diarrhea. With diarrheal diseases, the elimination of gut contents is part of the normal host defense mechanism, and thus decreasing motility is not indicated in most cases. 4. Osmotic overload: Any increase in osmotically active particles within the intestinal lumen can result in diarrhea. The increase can be associated with the administration or ingestion of osmotically active substances such as magnesium sulfate. The increase also may be associated with overloading of the intestine with carbohydrates or occasionally lipids beyond the amount that can be digested and absorbed. Therefore sudden dietary changes that result in significant shifts in gut flora and changes in fermentation or gastrointestinal diseases that result in malabsorption or maldigestion also may result in an osmotic diarrhea. In foals the loss of villus epithelial cells in the small intestine associated with disorders such as rotavirus infection and clostridiosis may lead not only to malabsorption but also to maldigestion caused by the decreased production of lactase. 4, 15 The resulting lactose intolerance allows excess lactose to enter the large intestine, increasing the osmotic load. 5. Increased hydraulic pressure from the blood to the lumen: This mechanism of diarrhea is more common in chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure or inflammatory bowel disease. The condition may result from decreased oncotic pressure associated with hypoproteinemia, increased capillary hydrostatic pressure (as in heart failure), or decreased lymphatic drainage associated with inflammation of lymphatics and lymph nodes. Understanding the mechanisms of diarrhea can be helpful in directing therapy. However, one must remember that most disorders that cause diarrhea, whether infectious or noninfectious, do so through inflammatory mechanisms resulting in multiple functional alterations.",

Age is particularly important because several disorders, such as foal heat diarrhea and rotavirus, are age related. The genetic background also may be significant, because diarrhea has been associated with certain heritable immunodeficiencies, and granulomatous bowel disease has been identified in three sibling horses. [18] [19] [20] Establishing whether the diarrhea is acute or chronic is important. Other historical questions of particular relevance include dietary changes, deworming program, involvement of single versus multiple animals, exposure to sand, and the use of medications, especially antibiotics and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. [21] [22] [23] Other concurrent diseases, stress, possible exposure to toxins, weight loss, water consumption, and salt availability also may be significant. The information obtained helps to prioritize differential diagnoses and direct further testing. The clinician should perform a complete physical examination. The body condition of the horse and the presence of any edema should be noted. The presence of fever, dehydration, or signs of endotoxemia may help in assessing the severity of the disease and differentiating the cause, because some causes of diarrhea are not associated typically with systemic signs of illness. Careful evaluation of the abdomen should be performed. Visible abdominal distention is often an indication of large intestinal distention, which may occur in association with acute colitis. However, distention also may be visible with colon. 24 Particularly in foals, transabdominal palpation and ballottement may be useful to identify increased abdominal fluid or large masses near the body wall. Transrectal palpation can be helpful in assessing the size of intestinal segments, consistency of contents, and wall thickness as well as in identifying masses, enlarged lymph nodes, or mesenteric arteritis.",

Some important parameters to evaluate include the presence of leukopenia, particularly neutropenia with a left shift and toxic changes in the white blood cells. These abnormalities suggest endotoxemia, which also may be associated with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathies. One also should evaluate the concentration of protein, as well as the albumin/globulin ratio. Significant hypoproteinemia, especially hypoalbuminemia caused primarily by protein loss, may occur with acute and chronic diarrhea. Hyperglobulinemia may indicate a chronic inflammatory condition. Disturbances in acid-base balance, especially metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte abnormalities frequently occur in cases of acute diarrhea but are uncommon in chronic diarrhea. Because of the dehydration frequently seen with acute diarrhea, prerenal azotemia is common and is important to recognize because some therapies, especially nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, may worsen the condition. In a study of 122 horses with acute diarrhea, horses with azotemia and clinicopathologic findings consistent with hemoconcentration and hypoproteinemia were less likely to survive. 17 The diagnostic and prognostic value of serum protein electrophoresis has been evaluated in horses with chronic diarrhea. 25 Significantly higher levels of \u03b2 1 -globulin were found in horses with larval cyathostomiais than in other horses, and such values in conjunction with a decreased albumin were helpful in diagnosing intestinal parasitism. However, a normal \u03b2 1 -globulin concentration was not a reliable indicator of the absence of the disease. Significantly lower albumin concentrations and significantly higher \u03b1 2 -globulin concentrations were found in horses that did not survive, suggesting that these parameters are nonspecific indicators of the severity of inflammatory changes within the intestinal wall. Parasitic infections, particularly strongylosis, also may be associated with elevated serum concentrations of immunoglobulin G(T). 26 Infrequently, immunodeficiencies are associated with diarrhea. 18, 19 Therefore in some cases, further evaluation of immune status may be indicated and may include specific immunoglobulin quantitation, evaluation of extreme dilation of multiple loops of small intestine. Careful auscultation of the abdomen can be useful in assessing motility. Generally, progressive borborygmi heard about every 3 to 4 minutes on both sides of the abdomen suggests normal motility of the cecum and colon. Auscultation behind the xiphoid process may help to identify the presence of sand or gravel if one hears particles grinding together during contractions of the",

In adult horses, abdominal radiography is limited somewhat by having the proper facilities and equipment to perform the procedure safely. However, radiographs can be effective in identifying radiodense material, such as enteroliths and sand. Ultrasonography can be used in horses of all ages to evaluate the amount and character of the peritoneal fluid, masses, intestinal distention, and wall thickness. In cases of right dorsal colitis, the diagnosis has been supported by ultrasonographic evidence of thickening of the right dorsal colon. Altough isotopelabeled white blood cell scintigraphic scans also may help identify colonic ulcerations, the availability and sensitivity of the procedure are limited.",

In both studies of poor performance the most common conditions causing airway obstruction were dorsal displacement of the soft palate and idiopathic left laryngeal hemiplegia with arytenoid collapse. Other conditions diagnosed included dynamic pharyngeal collapse, epiglottic entrapment, subepiglottic cyst, rostral displacement of the palatopharyngeal arch, and redundant alar folds. An important note is that many of the horses with airway obstruction did not have a history of abnormal respiratory noise and did not have abnormalities at rest. Also, not all abnormalities observed at rest caused obstruction. Therefore these studies emphasize the importance of treadmill videoendoscopy as a component of the evaluation of poor performance.

One should take care when using the V 200 to assess exercise capacity, because at a heart rate of 200, horses may be exercising at different proportions of their HRmax and therefore their maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2max ). In general, however, horses with the highest cardiovascular and metabolic capacities have the highest V 200 values; that is, the better horses reach a heart rate of 200 at higher speeds than those with a lower exercise capacity. The V 200 increases with training and can be useful for monitoring changes in fitness.

[23] [24] [25] As exercise becomes more intense, the aerobic energy contribution becomes insufficient to meet total energy requirements, and increased anaerobic metabolism results in increased lactate production. Lactate diffuses from muscle to blood, and therefore blood or plasma concentrations of lactate reflect muscle lactate. Some evidence suggests that whole blood concentrations most accurately measure lactate accumulation, because red blood cells actively take up lactate. [25] [26] [27] [28] The rate of increase of lactate in the blood may be used as an indirect indicator of cardiovascular and metabolic capacity. Horses with the highest aerobic capacities because of a high maximal cardiac output tend to have lower lactate values at submaximal exercise intensities than those with lower aerobic capacities. Lactate values can be used to compare horses or to evaluate training in the same horse. The treadmill speed at which a plasma lactate of 4 mmol/L (V LA4 ) is reached is one measure of lactate production, and a high value reflects good aerobic capacity. The V LA4 has been used to monitor changes in fitness. In fit Thoroughbred horses 3 years of age and over, values for V LA4 range from 8.0 to 9.5 m/sec. Horses that are not fit or have respiratory disease have lower values. Another useful reference is the blood or plasma lactate at conclusion of the 10 m/sec exercise step of the incremental test, and highly fit, athletic horses usually have values less than 5 mmol/L. High-quality sprint horses, which perform largely under anaerobic conditions and have a high anaerobic capacity, may have high peak lactate values.",

            "text": "Evaluation of the feces may yield important information in cases of diarrhea. Even the gross appearance of the feces can be helpful. For example, profuse, watery diarrhea is not generally consistent with a diagnosis of right dorsal colitis. Frank blood in the feces suggests bleeding into the distal colon from mucosal damage. Hemorrhagic, foul-smelling feces often are seen in association with clostridial diarrhea. One also can assess the feces for the presence of occult blood, which indicates bleeding from any source. Although excess sand in the feces is readily apparent in some cases, other cases require mixing the feces in a rectal sleeve with water and allowing the sand to settle.Microscopic examination of the feces for evidence of parasitism and evaluation of viable protozoal populations also may be useful. A direct smear of fresh feces allows for observation of the motility of ciliates and can be used as a screen for the presence of ova and oocysts, although more sensitive techniques, including fecal flotation and sedimentation, are recommended for evaluation of parasitism. Ideally, a quantitative method that allows for estimation of the number of eggs per gram of feces, such as McMaster's or Stolley's, is recommended. However, one must remember that fecal examination for parasites sometimes can be misleading, giving false-negative results. Cryptosporidium parvum infection can be difficult to diagnose, but oocysts can be detected in the feces by acid-fast staining or by immunofluorescence assay. 27 Fecal samples also can be examined microscopically for leukocytes and epithelial cells. In general the cellularity increases with the severity of diarrhea. Fecal leukocytes and epithelial cells are increased in salmonellosis, but are not specific for this disorder. 28 More than 10 leukocytes per high-power field may indicate salmonellosis.Evaluation of the feces for infectious agents is essential in the diagnostic evaluation of horses with diarrhea. Salmonella and Clostridium species are among the most common causes of bacterial diarrhea in horses. Other less common bacterial agents include Campylobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., and particularly in weanling age foals, Lawsonia intracellulare. 29, 30 Although primarily a respiratory pathogen, Rhodococcus equi also can cause diarrhea, particularly in foals 2 to 4 months of age. 31 Escherichia coli is an uncommon cause of diarrhea in foals, unlike in calves and piglets. However, enterotoxigenic strains, characterized by the presence of virulence factors, have been identified in foals. Gram stain and spore stain of fecal smears can help to identify and quantitate the bacterial populations present, particularly clostridial species. However, although large numbers of gram-positive rods or spores have been identified in foals with clostridial enterocolitis, the results of direct staining may be misleading. 32, 33 In one study, Clostridium perfringens was cultured from 59% of samples in which no gram-positive rods were visible. Some clostridial strains also are likely part of the normal microflora. 34 Large numbers of yeast in the feces should alert the clinician to the possibility of candidiasis, especially in compromised neonatal foals.Fecal culture is used commonly to establish a diagnosis in cases of bacterial diarrhea. When culturing feces, especially if an outside laboratory is used, one must consider proper sample handling, particularly for anaerobic clostridia. 35 Salmonella spp. are one of the most significant bacterial pathogens in equine feces. 36 Although the number of Salmonella spp. organisms isolated from the feces of horses with clinical salmonellosis is generally greater than from horses with asymptomatic infections, the volume of feces in horses with profuse diarrhea may decrease recovery. Culture of multiple fecal samples, typically five, is recommended to increase the sensitivity. Culture of a rectal mucosal biopsy or rectal scraping is an alternative to fecal cultures and may increase sensitivity, because Salmonella spp. are intracellular organisms. Identifying clostridial species requires anaerobic culture. However, evaluating the presence of toxin in cases of suspected clostridial diarrhea also is critical, because Clostridium spp., particularly C. perfringens type A, may be present in normal equine feces. 34 Depending on the clostridial species and the laboratory, toxin can be assessed by detecting preformed toxin in the feces, toxin being produced by the isolate in culture, or the toxin gene in the isolate. [32] [33] [34] [35] An increasing number of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are available for detecting causative agents of equine diarrhea. In comparing a PCR with microbial culture for detection of salmonellae in equine feces and environmental samples, the PCR method was found to be more sensitive and more rapid and required submission of fewer samples. 37, 38 Currently, PCR is also available for detection of Ehrlichia risticii, the causative agent of Potomac horse fever, in feces and peripheral blood. 39, 40 Fecal PCR analysis also has been shown to be useful in documenting equine proliferative enteropathy caused by A surprising number of horses presented for poor performance are found to be lame, even when lameness is not part of the presenting complaint. 1,2,4 Therefore the clinician should perform a complete lameness examination in all cases. In some horses presented for poor performance, the gait asymmetry may be subtle and only discernable at high speed, making diagnosis by traditional methods difficult. In these cases, gait analysis on the treadmill and advanced diagnostic techniques such as nuclear scintigraphy, thermography, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be useful. One also should perform a neurologic examination to identify any deficits that could contribute to poor performance.Myopathy can lead to decreased performance. In many cases the condition is subclinical and requires an exercise challenge test to make the diagnosis. 3,10 One should measure creatine kinase before exercise and ideally 4 to 6 hours after an exercise bout consisting of 15 to 30 minutes at the trot. In normal horses, this light exercise rarely causes more than a threefold increase in creatine kinase. An increase of fivefold or more indicates exertional rhabdomyolysis. A muscle biopsy can help to define the myopathy. In the study by Martin, Reef, Parente et al., 10 of 348 horses developed clinical exertional rhabdomyolysis after exercise, and an additional 53 demonstrated subclinical myopathy as demonstrated by increased creatine kinase levels after exercise. 3",

            "text": "Exercise testing provides a mechanism for evaluating a range of body systems under standard exercise conditions. In particular, measurements of cardiorespiratory and metabolic function taken during an exercise test provide information about the capacity and efficiency of key body systems involved in energy production. From a clinical standpoint, exercise testing is generally most useful in assessing the effect on performance of abnormalities found on a physical examination. Testing also may help to establish the reason for reduced athletic capacity in horses that have no abnormalities on basic examinations. Exercise testing can be done in the field, which mimics the condition in which the horse actually performs. However, most testing is currently done on a treadmill, which provides more standard conditions and an opportunity to perform a greater range of measurements. The specific protocol used for exercise testing may vary somewhat. 1, 18, 19 Occasionally a high-speed test is performed in which the horse is accelerated rapidly to maximum speed and run to fatigue. However, the most common type of test is an incremental test in which the speed increases every 1 to 2 minutes until the horse reaches fatigue, allowing for the generation of data during submaximal and maximal exercise. In most cases the test is performed with the treadmill at a slope of 10%. This slope is not so steep as to be completely unrepresentative of normal exercise,",
