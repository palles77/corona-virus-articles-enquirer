            "text": "Human coronaviruses are one of the main causes of upper respiratory tract infections in humans. While more often responsible for mild illness, they have been associated with illnesses that require hospitalization. In this study, an assay for one of the human coronaviruses, OC43, was developed using a truncated recombinant nucleocapsid (N) protein antigen in an enzyme immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and evaluated using serum collected from HCoV-OC43-infected patients, healthy adults, and patients with other respiratory virus infections. Results showed that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 90.9% (10/11) and 82.9% (39/47), respectively. To evaluate the clinical utility of the ELISA, serum samples collected from patients during an outbreak of HCoV-OC43 infection and previously identified as positive by HCoV-OC43 whole N ELISA were screened resulting in 100% diagnosis agreement between the testing methods. These results suggest that this assay offers a reliable method to detect HCoV-OC43 infection and may be a useful tool in coronavirus seroepidemiological studies.",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first identified in the 1960s (Hamre et al., 1967) , but with the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the subsequent isolation of new HCoV family members (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005) , considerable attention has recently been focused on understanding their molecular diversity, prevalence, and clinical impact. Sequence analyses have classified the four identified HCoVs into two groups with group 1b containing HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 and group2a containing HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 . Seroprevalence estimates for HCoVs range from 5 to 30% of all respiratory infections (Woo et al., 2005) . Though infections are primarily associated with mild respiratory symptoms, HCoV-OC43 and other coronaviruses have been linked to severe infections, neuroinvasive disease, and even fatalities in vulnera- ble subpopulations such as the elderly, prompting further interest in HCoV-OC43 epidemiology (Arbour et al., 2000; Patrick et al., 2006; Rota et al., 2003) . However, epidemiologic surveys and large scale surveillance studies have been limited by the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic approaches (Lehmann et al., 2008) . HCoV infection can induce antibodies that cross react among the HCoVs making it difficult to estimate prevalence of infection for the different HCoV viruses without doing neutralization assays. Development of more specific enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for the HCoV strains would help to clarify strain-specific patterns of infection. A highly specific, rapid diagnostic assay would significantly improve surveillance and the investigation of HCoV-OC43 distribution.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are made up of a single positive-strand RNA genome encoding four major structural proteins, spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E). The nucleocapsid protein has been recognized as an important target in the development of HCoV diagnostics because it reliably induces a good antibody response (Mourez et al., 2007) . However, the N protein has sequences that are conserved among HCoVs and, therefore, antibodies detected may have been induced by other HCoVs resulting in a false positive results for the HCoV strains of interest (Chan et al., 2009; Mourez et al., 2007; Severance et al., 2008) . Analysis of the aa sequence of HCoV N proteins suggests that parts of the protein could provide a more specific antigen for EIAs. To investigate this possibility, serologic assays using truncated recombinant HCoV-OC43 N proteins were developed and evaluated in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) against a serum samples from HCoV-OC43 (group 2a), HCoV-229E (group 1b), and SARS-CoV (group 2b) infected patients. Each antigen was assessed for its diagnostic accuracy, optimal cut-off, and sensitivity and specificity. One of the truncated OC43 N proteins gave minimal cross-reactivity and allowed for serological differentiation of past HCoV-OC43 infection from other CoV infections and to estimate seroprevalence of HCoV-OC43 in 162 healthy adults.",

ROC analysis allows for data that is not normally distributed and for evaluation of sensitivity and specificity to be determined separately. The null hypothesis of ROC analysis is that the testing method is no better than flipping a coin, as would be demonstrated by a diagonal line on the ROC curve and an area under the curve (AUC) equal to 0.5 while a perfect test would have an AUC of 1. Given the limited detection of the HCoV-OC43 acute sera by HCoV-OC43 N3 protein ( Fig. 2A) , ROC analysis was completed based on the results of screening 11 HCoV-OC43 positive convalescent and 47 negative serum specimens (Fig. 3) . AUC value for HCoV-OC43 N3 was 0.894 (data not shown). Optimal cut-off values for positive test results were determined by plotting percent sensitivity and specificity against OD cut-off values (Fig. 3A) . The cut-off value was set at 0.161 (OD 405 value at intersectional point in Fig. 3A) with a corresponding sensitivity of 90.1% and specificity of 82.9%. With this cut-off value, 10 out of 11 HCoV-OC43 convalescent samples had positive test results with the remaining sample producing a borderline result. The sensitivity of the HCoV-OC43 N3 protein ELISA was comparable to that of the whole HCoV-OC43 N protein ELISA (Fig. 3B ). While the overall mean OD values for both acute and convalescent specimens were higher using the whole HCoV-OC43 N protein ELISA, the HCoV OC43 N3 ELISA had a better ability to detect rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens than the whole HCoV-OC43 N protein ELISA. Using the established cut-off value, the 47 HCoV-229E (n = 27) and SARS (n = 20) serum samples were re-screened by HCoV-OC43 N3 ELISA. One acute and one convalescent serum sample from two HCoV-229E patients and convalescent sera from six SARS patients showed reactivity to HCoV-OC43 N3 protein for 82.9% specificity (Fig. 4A) .

Included in the CoV N protein, is a highly conserved region (FYYL-GTGP; aa125-132 of HCoV-OC43) that occurs in the N-terminal portion (Rota et al., 2003) which, if immunogenic, would induce cross-reactivity antibodies against other coronaviruses (Chan et al., 2009; Sun and Meng, 2004; Woo et al., 2004; Patrick et al., 2006) . One approach to reduce antigenic cross-reactivity was to divide the HCoV-OC43 N protein into three regions and evaluate the resultant truncated proteins with serum specimens from HCoV-OC43-infected, HCoV-229E-infected, or SARS CoV-infected persons in these antibody assays. As expected, both HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV positive sera showed reactivity to the N2 protein but no reactivity to the N1 protein. The HCoV-OC43 positive sera showed comparable reactivity to both N1 and N2 fragments. Serum samples positive for other CoV infections (i.e. SARS and HCoV-229E) showed low to moderate reactivity and convalescent-phase HCoV-OC43 sera showed high reactivity to the N3 protein. Acute phase HCoV-OC43 sera showed minimal reactivity to all truncated N proteins consistent with their origin from individuals susceptible to infection. The lack of reactivity against these acute-phase specimens also demonstrates that assays based on these proteins are more specific than those based on full length N (Fig. 4B ). Of the three truncated proteins, the HCoV-OC43 N3 fragment had the lowest sequence homology with other coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins and was associated with the highest signal in convalescent HCoV-OC43 sera.

While consistent with early seroepidemiologic studies, our seroprevalence rates are lower than recently reported rates for HCoV-OC43 of 88-100% using recombinant whole nucleocapsidbased IgG ELISA, IFA and Western blot assays (Mourez et al., 2007; Severance et al., 2008) . In those studies the use of whole HCoV-OC43 N protein may have given too high a rate of past infection because it detected antibodies induced by other HCoVs that cross-react with the N protein. In this study, the HCoV-OC43 N3 ELISA detected antibodies in two serum samples from HCoV-229E patients and sera from six SARS patients. These antibodies could represent prior HCoV-OC43 infection or antibodies that induced by these viruses that cross react with HCoV-OC43. Due to the limited availability of human sera collected after confirmation of HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 infection, polyclonal sera from mice immunized with HCoV-HKU1 or HCoV-NL63 N proteins were screened and did not show any reactivity to HCoV-OC43 N3 protein further demonstrating the specificity of the assay.",
