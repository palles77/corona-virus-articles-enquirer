            "text": "A t a time when the transmission of a dangerous infectious disease threatens not merely a local population but the world at large as the result of immigration and, particularly, increased and faster travel, any outbreak elicits considerable concern and demands that various precautionary methods be instituted and that the disease be contained as quickly as possible. We recently experienced such a situation with the outbreak of a new disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which caused the death of numerous people and raised awareness of the speed with which a disease can reach pandemic proportions. Most recently, an old disease, one that may have been present for centuries and was identified decades ago, reared its ugly head, killing more than 200 people before it was contained. Fortunately, the disease, Marburg hemorrhagic fever (MHF), was limited to a small geographic area, but the devastation of lives was much greater than that of many epidemics and was a warning of the numerous factors, including fear, lack of understanding, and deception, that can exacerbate the spread of disease and hinder implementation of restraints. This article reviews the history of the disease caused by Marburg virus and its biological components.",

            "text": "Discovery and Early Outbreaks MHF was described first in 1967, when outbreaks in Germany and the former Yugoslavia were linked to African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) imported from a primate export facility in Entebbe, Uganda. 1 A total of 37 cases, including six from secondary transmission, ultimately were reported; seven deaths occurred in primary cases. 2 In England, an infectious agent, unlike any previously seen, was recovered from the blood and organs of these persons. Researchers called the agent Marburg virus. [3] [4] [5] [6] The first recognized outbreak of Marburg virus in Africa occurred in February 1975 (Fig 1) , eliciting considerable press coverage (Fig 2) . The index case was a young Australian who had been touring Rhodesia. He was admitted to the Johannesburg Hospital and died on the seventh day from hemorrhage resulting from a combination of disseminated intravascular coagulation and hepatic failure. Tests performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that he had contracted Marburg virus ( Fig  3) . Two secondary cases, the first patient's traveling companion and a nurse, also were reported. Both of these patients survived after being given vigorous supportive treatment and prophylactic heparin. 7 In 1980, two other cases occurred, one of which was in Western Kenya not far from the Ugandan source of the monkeys implicated in the 1967 outbreak. The patient's attending physician in Nairobi became the second case. Yet another infection was diagnosed in 1987 when a young man who had traveled extensively in Kenya became ill and died. 6 In 1995, a related disease, Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), reemerged in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The disease was contained by the implementation of house-tohouse searches, interviews of healthcare personnel, retrospective contact tracing, and direct follow-up of suspect cases, as well as other measures (Fig 4) . The onset of the earliest documented case occurred on January 6, 1995, and the last patient died on July 16, 1995. During that period, a total of 315 cases of EHF were reported, including 80 cases among healthcare workers, with an 81 percent case fatality rate. Two individuals were reported to be the source of infection in more than 50 cases, highlighting the potential for fast and widespread transmission of diseases. 8 Three years later, an outbreak of MHF occurred in 1998 in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo; it was the largest outbreak to have occurred at that time. 9, 10 The epicenter of the outbreak was the village of Durba in the Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9 District, Oriental Province. Because of the remoteness of the area and the fact that a civil war that was occurring, access to the area and evaluation of the disease were delayed until May 1999, when an international team of investigators was able to perform studies. These investigators identified 73 cases (8 laboratory-confirmed and 65 suspected and later identified retrospectively). 11 Later follow-up surveillance identified more than 150 cases through December 2000. 12 ",

The news service also reported that Vice Health Minister Jose Van Dunem had said that 101 cases of the illness had been reported in a hospital in the city of Uife, that 93 people had died, and that two people had left the hospital without having been properly discharged. 13 On March 23, 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that Marburg virus was the causative agent of the outbreak of viral hemorrhagic fever in Uige Province in northern Angola. On March 25, 2005 , the CDC reported that their Special Pathogens Branch had identified the presence of Marburg virus in 9 of 12 specimens from patients who had died during the outbreak in Angola. The CDC Branch is a WHO Collaborating Center on Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers. Testing done in that laboratory had confirmed the presence of the virus using a combination of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antigen-detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and virus isolation. The CDC immediately posted an outbreak notice on their travelers' health website.",

            "text": "On that same day (March 25), the BBC news service reported that the virus had reached the capital, Luanda, where six victims, all of whom had visited Uige recently, had been diagnosed. The news service also reported that the European Union had announced that it would donate $650,000 US. 14 Between October 1, 2004, and March 29, 2005, a total of 124 cases were identified, of which 117 were fatal. All of the cases had originated in Uige Province. Approximately 75 percent of the reported cases had occurred in children aged 5 years or younger. 15, 16 By April 6, 156 people were reported dead, and working conditions were extremely difficult for healthcare providers, who were facing a huge challenge. Swathed in head-to-toe protective medical gear that requires half an hour to put on and 45 minutes to remove, physicians were contending with extreme heat as well as a feeling of helplessness, knowing that there is no cure for the disease. 17 Exacerbated by fear and ignorance among the people, who feared going to the hospital because they considered it the source of the disease, the death toll continued to climb. News reports told of a crisis situation in which some Angolans were taking out their anxiety on healthcare providers, requiring mobile surveillance teams in Uige to suspend operations when vehicles were attacked and damaged by residents. On April 8, the news media reported that the organization staff in Uige was notified of several workers' deaths but that teams were unable to investigate the causes of death or collect the bodies for burial. One report said that residents who erroneously thought the workers were exposing them to the virus had killed them. A spokesperson for WHO was reported to have explained that \"the dramatic symptoms of Marburg hemorrhagic fever and its frequent fatality are resulting in a high level of fear, which is further aggravated by a lack of public understanding about the disease. Moreover, because the disease has no cure, hospitalization is not associated with a favorable outcome, and confidence in the medical care system has been eroded.\" 17, 18 Days later, news reports were providing details of the results of fear and ignorance that were fueling the outbreak, including that terrified residents had stoned WHO worker's vehicles and that they were hiding patients at home, contributing to the spread of the disease. Fatomata Diallo, a WHO country repre- sentative was quoted as explaining that the fear is seen \"especially in this kind of epidemic where you have to have special clothes, like an astronaut, and come into the family to take a sick person or suspected case (Fig 5) . When you come to take away a body, a dead body, with all this kind of clothing, sometimes it is not easy for the community to accept it.\" 19 On Friday, April 8, WHO issued through the United Nations an appeal for $2.4 million US to support the emergency response to the outbreak. WHO already had established an international network of laboratories, including two portable field laboratories in Angola, to help in the investigation of Marburg and other viral hemorrhagic fevers On April 22, 2005, a report was issued stating that the outbreak of the virus that had claimed 244 lives in Angola had been confined to the province of Uige, as no new cases had been detected outside the northern region. Deputy Health Minister Jose Van Dunem was quoted as saying that they had \"circumscribed the epidemic to the province of Uige\" and that four provinces and the capital Luanda had not reported any new cases. Of the 244 persons who had died (of a total of 266 cases), 228 were from the northern province of Uige. He also was quoted as saying that \"the disease is on a decline\" and that \"the epidemic is under control because we know how it is transmitted, how to break the chain of transmission.\" 20 Update: As of 16 June, the Ministry of Health in Angola had reported a total of 422 cases and 356 deaths in Uige Province. Twenty-one contacts were being followed in Uige municipality, and 111 were being followed in other municipalities. Alerts to potential cases existing in difficult-to-reach locations outside Uige municipality had been received and plans were underway for a team to travel by helicopter to investigate these cases. http:// www.who.int/csr/don/2005_06_17/en/index.html",

Patients often develop severe hemorrhagic manifestations between days 5 and 7, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple sites. Symptoms become increasingly severe and can include jaundice, inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock, liver failure, massive hemorrhaging, and multiorgan dysfunction. The fatality rates have ranged from 25 to 80 percent, with higher rates occurring in outbreaks lacking effective case management. 6, 15 In the case of the outbreak in Angola, WHO has reported a greater than 90 percent case fatality rate, rendering this outbreak the deadliest on record for this rare disease: the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 1998 to 2000 had a case fatality rate of 83 percent. 21",

Although the number of antibody-positive survey participants was small, these investigators were able to systematically identify and quantify several risk factors. The local mines were found to be a probable site of primary infection with the virus, most likely through exposure to the primary zoonotic reservoir; this conclusion was based on the preponderance of antibody in male miners without obvious evidence of person-to-person transmis-sion, as well as other factors. Close contact with case patients with the disease or corpses was identified as a risk factor for secondary transmission of Marburg virus.

WHO and international partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) worked with the Ministry of Health in Angola to conduct an investigation and public health response to the outbreak. Outbreak-control efforts were directed at providing technical support for case management, strengthening infection control in hospitals, improving surveillance and contact tracing, and educating residents about the disease and its mode or transmission. As part of a public health response, in addition to posting information for travelers, the CDC sent personnel to join the WHO-coordinated GOARN response team. The CDC representatives assisted with epidemiologic investigation, infection control, and laboratory diagnosis. The CDC also provided laboratory and other scientific and logistical support. 15 In most Western countries, MHF is a reportable or notifiable disease. Cases or outbreaks also should be reported to the WHO. The virus is a hazard category 4 virus and should be handled in a containment level 4 laboratory. Strict isolation and barrier nursing are recommended, and the handling of biological specimens for diagnosis and patient management should be performed according to regulations governing risk assessment and control. Case contacts or individuals with exposure in laboratories should be placed under health surveillance for 21 days after their last exposure to infection. If they should become feverish, they should undergo risk assessment and perhaps be admitted to strict isolation pending the results of diagnostic tests. 5 In conjunction with the WHO, the CDC has developed guidelines entitled \"Infection Control for Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers in the African Health Care Setting.\" English and French versions of the manual can be obtained online at http://www. cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/vhfmanual.htm.",
