PEDV is an enveloped single-stranded RNA Coronavirus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus. PEDV genome (28 kb in length) has seven open reading frames (ORFs) and encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) as well as three non-structural proteins: replicates 1a, 1b and ORF3 (Song and Park, 2012) . Among these proteins, PEDV S glycoprotein shows an important role on host cell entry and viral virulence and could be divided structurally into the S1 and S2 regions (Song and Park, 2012) , which is also a key protein exhibiting major genetic variations among different stains (Sun et al., 2015) .",

The analysis of PEDV S gene showed that at N-terminal domain (NTD) of S gene, these 10 strains included two notable insertions at 166 nt to 177 nt and 337 nt to 339 nt, respectively, and one deletion between 477 nt to 483 nt at S gene compared with CV777.

The 3 PEDV S2\u25b3strains were grouped into G2b Pandemic strains, and the remaining 7 PEDV strains were grouped into G2a Pandemic strains (Fig. 2) . In G2b, PEDV S2\u25b3strains (CH/hubei/2015, CH/hubei/2016, CH/huaiyang/2015) with a part of reference PEDVs strains possessed a same specific 3-nt deletion in S2 gene (Fig. 1) . Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis of PEDV complete genomes showed that the PEDV S2\u25b3strain (CH/hubei/2016) was not grouped into same subgroup with the other reference PEDV strains possessed S2 3 nt deletion (Fig. 3) . This phenomenon maybe explained by the fact that CH/ hubei/2016 may result from the recombination between AH2012-12 (G2b) which had 3 nt-delection in S2 and CH-ZMDZY-11(G2a) (Fig. 4) . Previous study revealed that recombination events in S1 gene between different PEDV groups may contribute to the genetic diversity of PEDV (Jarvis et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2016) . Furthermore, Taiwan New PEDV variants have two potential recombination breakpoints in S1 and S2 (Chiou et al., 2017) . All these fact indicted that recombination, insertion and deletion in the S gene may contribute to the genetic diversity of PEDV. However, because of only one complete PEDV S2\u25b3strain genomes was included into the phylogenetic analysis, further study need to explore the evolution position of PEDV S2\u25b3strains.",

Our study Fig. 4 . Detection of potential recombination events in CH hubei 2016 by RDP4. a One recombination breakpoints were located at 23310 to 24,12 nt. The analysis was performed with an RDP distance model, a window size of 1000 base pairs and a step size of 200 base pair; b Fast neighbor-joining (NJ) tree constructed using the recombinant region of each potential recombinant event; c Fast neighbor-joining (NJ) tree constructed using the non-recombinant region of each potential recombinant event. In current study, the strains with specific genetic signatures-3 nt deletion in S2 gene was firstly identified and reported (PEDV S2\u25b3strains), and one of strain (CH/hubei/2016) was clustered into different groups based on PEDV S gene or complete genomes. This fact may result from the recombination between AH2012-12 (G2b) which had 3 nt-delection in S2 and CH-ZMDZY-11(G2a). In contrast with central China of PEDV strains, PDCoV had low positive rates and had a close relationship with other PDCoV strains of China in 2012 to 2015. Future work should continue to trace the variability of PEDV strains and PDCoV strains. ",
