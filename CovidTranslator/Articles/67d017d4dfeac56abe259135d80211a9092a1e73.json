            "text": "Background: Live poultry markets (LPMs) pose a threat to public health by promoting the amplification and dissemination of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) and by providing the ideal setting for zoonotic influenza transmission. Objective: This review assessed the impact of different interventions implemented in LPMs to control the emergence of zoonotic influenza. Methods: Publications were identified through a systematic literature search in the PubMed, MEDLINE and Web of Science databases. Eligible studies assessed the impact of different interventions, such as temporary market closure or a ban on holding poultry overnight, in reducing i) AIV-detection rates in birds and the market environment or ii) influenza incidence in humans. Unpublished literature, reviews, editorials, cross-sectional studies, theoretical models and publications in languages other than English were excluded. Relevant findings were extracted and critically evaluated. For the comparative analysis of findings across studies, standardized outcome measures were computed as i) the relative risk reduction (RRR) of AIV-detection in LPMs and ii) incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of H7N9incidence in humans. Results: A total of 16 publications were identified and reviewed. Collectively, the data suggest that AIV-circulation can be significantly reduced in the LPM-environment and among market-birds through (i) temporary LPM closure, (ii) periodic rest days (iii) market depopulation overnight and (iv) improved hygiene and disinfection. Overall, the findings indicate that the length of stay of poultry in the market is a critical control point to interrupt the AIV-replication cycle within LPMs. In addition, temporary LPM closure was associated with a significant reduction of the incidence of zoonotic influenza. The interpretation of these findings is limited by variations in the implementation of interventions. In addition, some of the included studies were of ecologic nature or lacked an inferential framework, which might have lead to cosiderable confounding and bias. Conclusions: The evidence collected in this review endorses permanent LPM-closure as a long-term objective to reduce the zoonotic risk of avian influenza, although its economic and socio-political implications favour less drastic interventions, e.g. weekly rest days, for implementation in the short-term.",

Influenza viruses can also be found in other mammals and birds, and the greatest diversity of influenza viruses occurs in aquatic birds [2] . Most strains of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) do not pose a risk to human health. Some strains however, e.g. subtypes H7N9 [3] and H5N1 [4] , have acquired the ability to cross the speciesbarrier and infect humans who come into close contact with infected birds or contaminated environments [5] . Occasionally, animal influenza viruses cause global pandemics in humans, as happened three times in the 20th century and most recently in 2009 [6, 7] . Surveillance of avian influenza viruses is important to identify new strains that may pose a pandemic threat [8] .",

A multivariable Poisson General Linear Model (GLM) adjusted for several potential confounders of AIVtransmission was used to calculate relative risks (RRs) of weekly H9N2-isolation during the different intervention periods, compared to the time period prior to the implementation of the first rest day [20] . According to this model, the introduction of one monthly rest day resulted in a 27% (p-value = 0.22) or 58% (pvalue = 0.001) reduction in H9N2 average isolation rates in chickens and minor poultry, respectively [20] . After the quail sale ban and the second monthly rest day, average isolation rates from both chickens (RR = 0.56; p-value = 0.09) and minor poultry (RR = 0.37; p-value = 0.01) declined further, although these interventions did not affect the circulation of H9N2 significantly [20] . A follow-up study revealed that a ban on overnight storage of live poultry introduced in 2008 dramatically reduced H9N2-isolation rates by an additional 84% and 100% in chickens and minor poultry, respectively (p-values b 0.05) [21] .",

These two studies convincingly demonstrated that both frequent rest days [20, 21] and a ban on holding live poultry overnight [21] were effective in reducing H9N2-transmission within the LPM. The overnight ban is particularly effective, because it limits the length of stay of the birds in the markets, removing susceptible or newly infected birds from the LPM before they become infectious themselves. This identifies the birds' length of stay and the AIVincubation period between infection and onset of transmission as critical control points of AIV-circulation, as also postulated by mathematical models [36] .",

The long-term elimination of H7-strains from the American LBM-system demonstrates that eradication of AIVs from market environments is possible through regular interruptions of the constant bird flow and disinfection, although the role of additional measures, e.g. all-year-round vehicle washing, was also evident [23, 24] .",

Accordingly, even though the monthly rest day in Hong Kong had an immediate impact on H9N2-circulation [19] , it did not significantly reduce average isolation rates over longer time periods [20, 21] . Over the years, the live quail sale ban induced a comparatively much more dramatic risk reduction of AIV-isolation compared to one or even two monthly rest days, although the ban of keeping poultry overnight led to the most sustained impact [21] . The impact of the ban on the sale of live quails was context-dependent, as it was introduced based on previous research demonstrating that quails were the species with the highest virus shedding rates within Hong Kong LPMs at the time of the investigations.",

The studies in Hong Kong were of necessity carried out with subtype H9N2, which is more endemic in incoming poultry than, for example, the more clinically relevant H5N1. When virus prevalence is very high in incoming birds, viral amplification within the LPM would be a less significant factor in determining overall zoonotic exposure. In this case, even the ban on holding live poultry overnight might fail to substantially reduce human exposure (Fig. 2) . In the case of AIV strains that have lower prevalence within incoming poultry, it is possible that even the monthly or bimonthly rest days would significantly reduce overall exposure of humans to the zoonotic viruses (Fig. 2) .",

For instance, the effectiveness of the overnight ban would be greatly compromised, if residual poultry was simply moved to an \"off-site\" holding facility and re-introduced [38] and low perceived self-infection risk [39] among LPM workers, it is not unreasonable to suspect that the motivation to adhere to a rigorous implementation of these interventions and to carry out effective disinfection of the premises may decline over time. To date, the relative contribution of the disinfection of the market to the observed impact of rest days or overnight bans is not elucidated. Emptying of the facilities may already be sufficient to reduce residual viral load through thermal inactivation of the virus infectivity. Additional studies using virus isolation (rather than RT-PCR, which does not discriminate between live and dead virus) are needed to address these questions. Finally, it is relevant to note that the amplification of avian influenza in live poultry markets also contributes to dissemination of viruses back to poultry farms via contaminated cages and trucks (Fig. 3) [8, 11] . Evidently, measures to reduce AIV amplification in LPMs may reduce the spread of avian influenza to both the upstream poultry production sector and to humans, thus truly exemplifying the implementation of the \"one health\" concept.",

In addition, sample sizes were very variable [21, 26, 27] . Importantly, samples were usually collected from different markets, distinct market areas and from several bird species, but pre-and post-intervention data was not unequivocally matched [19] [20] [21] 23, 26, 27] . Moreover, some investigations assessed AIV-prevalence by virus isolation [19] [20] [21] 23, 27] , while others used RT-PCR [26, 27] . Positive RT-PCR results do not discriminate between viable infectious virus and inactivated virus and thus does not have the same biological implications as virus isolation does. Finally, some interventions had different impacts on AIV circulation in different bird species [20, 21] . This suggests distinct AIV-transmission dynamics across species or varying market practises, highlighting the importance to investigate different species separately.",

Moreover, such a dramatic intervention would imply a major re-structuring of the current poultry industry in many parts of Asia [29, 48] , the annihilation of a long-standing culture of live bird trading and the potential amplification of illegal poultry trafficking [49] . It is also relevant to note that, while the majority of zoonotic H7N9-cases have a history of exposure to poultry or LPM, a minority of them do not [50] [51] [52] .",

In this scenario, even frequent depopulation interventions might fail to substantially reduce human exposure. (B) Effectiveness of regular rest days in LPMs in reducing isolation rates of H5N1. If the AIV-prevalence among incoming birds is relatively low, regular rest days might substantially reduce the risk of human exposure to zoonotic infection.",
