These models are employed to evaluate the effectiveness of various control programs via vaccination and antiviral treatment. We use susceptible-, infectious-, recovered-type epidemic models consisting of ordinary differential equations. These models allow us to derive threshold conditions that can be used to assess the effectiveness of vaccine and drug use and to determine disease outcomes. Simulations are helpful for examining the potential consequences of control options under different scenarios. Particularly, results from models with constant parameters and models with time-dependent parameter functions are compared, demonstrating the significant differences in model outcomes. Results suggest that the effectiveness of vaccination and drug treatment can be very sensitive to factors including the time of introduction of the pathogen into the population, the beginning time of control programs, and the levels of control measures. More importantly, in some cases, the benefits of vaccination and antiviral use might be significantly compromised if these control programs are not designed appropriately. Mathematical models can be very useful for understanding the effects of various factors on the spread and control of infectious diseases. Particularly, the models can help identify potential adverse effects of vaccination and drug treatment in the case of pandemic influenza.",

This area of study has been highlighted recently due to the advent of a new strain of pandemic influenza, worries about the possible reintroduction of smallpox and the emergence of new pathogens such as the SARS coronavirus. The mathematical theory pioneered by Ross, MacDonald, Kermack, McKendrick, and others has played a major role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases (see also (1) ). More recently, researchers have used mathematical models to better understand influenza dynamics and to investigate how to effectively control influenza via various strategies including antiviral treatment and vaccination (see, for example, (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) ).",

In that study, we fit the model to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) influenza data collected during early months of the year, optimizing the model parameters associated with the time-dependent transmission, and the time at which the initial case was introduced. The optimized model was then used to forecast the timing of the autumn wave of infection (see (8) ). The most striking feature of the model is that it accurately predicted the peak time of the pandemic. According to the CDC 2009 H1N1 surveillance reports (9) , the peak of the fall wave was reached at the end of October (which is between weeks 42 and 43, see the left-hand plot in Fig. 1 ), which is consistent with our model result (see the right-hand plot in Fig. 1) .",

In this analysis, we express the periodic transmission rate as the first-order harmonic with a 1-year period: where, \u03b2 0 is a constant representing a background transmission rate and \u03b5 is a constant related to the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuation. The function \u03b2(t) given in (2.4) has its maximum at the beginning of a calendar year. When the transmission rate is expressed in this form, the time of introduction of the pathogen to the population t 0 is a crucial parameter of the seasonal model because the final size and shape of the epidemic curve (including how many peaks the epidemic exhibits within one calendar year) can depend quite strongly on this parameter (whereas for models with constant \u03b2, the final size and shape are independent of t 0 ). Further, the shape of the epidemic curve also strongly depends on the initial fraction of susceptibles in the population at t 0 when \u03b2(t) is periodic.",

The definition of < 0 for models with constant parameters is the average number of secondary infections produced by one infected individual during his/her entire period of infection in a wholly susceptible population. This number determines whether there will be an outbreak of the disease when an infectious person is introduced into the population and how severe the outbreak will be in the absence of any programs of disease control and prevention. Figure 3 illustrates the disease outcomes of system (2.1) with the initial condition (2.2) and constant transmission rate \u03b2 0 . It demonstrates that the threshold condition < 0 \u00bc 1 determines whether there will be an outbreak < 0 > 1 \u00f0 \u00de or not < 0 < 1 \u00f0 \u00de. It also shows clearly that the severity of an epidemic depends on the magnitude of the reproduction number < 0 . Besides the kind of deterministic outcomes presented in Fig. 3 , the modeling structure shown in (2.1) can also be used to simulate the situations in which the disease events (e.g., infection and recovery) may occur randomly (while being governed by the event rates determined by the equations in (2.1)). By incorporating the randomness of disease transmission process, the models will be capable of providing helpful information about how likely a certain disease outcome will be expected under a given condition. One of the approaches for stochastic simulations is the event/time approach (10) . Consider the model (2.1) with constant transmission rate \u03b2. There are only two possible events at time t i (i=0, 1, 2, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7); a new infection which occurs at the rate r 1 (t i )=\u03b2S(t i )I(t i )/N and a recovery which occurs at the rate r 2 (t i )=\u03b3I(t i ).

However, when p 0 continues to increase from 0.1 to 0.15, one epidemic peak becomes two with the second peak higher than the first (see a3 and a6), and the final epidemic size is larger than the case of p 0 =0.1. This differs from the case of t 0 =40 shown in b. In this case, for the lower p 0 value (p 0 =0.1) two peaks occurred and the final size is higher than that without vaccination use (compare b1 and b4). However, when p 0 exceeds 0.22 the peak and final sizes will not be higher than those without vaccination use. Both peak and final sizes will continue to decrease when p 0 increases (see b2-b3 and b5-b6) the case of periodic transmission rate \u03b2(t) may generate nonintuitive results. That is, the model can exhibit outcomes in which an increased use of vaccination or antiviral drugs will lead to a higher morbidity.

Simulation results for two different values t v are demonstrated in the middle panel (t v =60) and the bottom panel (t v =100). In each panel, outcomes for three p 0 values are compared. A dramatic difference is that for the case of t v =60 the peak and final epidemic sizes exceed those without vaccination use, whereas for the case of t v =100 the peak and final size decrease monotonically with increasing p 0 . We need to point out that although this set of simulations suggest that an earlier start of vaccination use is not beneficial (due to an increased peak and final sizes), this may not be the cases for other values of t 0 (simulations not shown here). That is, whether and how much vaccination can help to reduce the severity of epidemics depends jointly on t v and t 0 . Figure 10 illustrates the effect of drug treatment either used alone (i.e., f 0 >0 and p 0 =0) or combined with vaccination (i.e., f 0 >0 and p 0 >0).

This larger number of susceptibles can, in some cases, act as tinder for a much larger epidemic to occur in the more favorable influenza season of autumn than may have occurred if treatment had not been used in the summer months. Thus, to increase the likelihood of successful control programs, policy decisions should take into consideration the potential impact of these factors on disease transmission dynamics.",

            "text": "In this paper, we use simple SIR-type epidemic models to study the effect of vaccination and antiviral use on the control and prevention of infectious diseases. Model analyses and simulations are carried out using parameter values related to influenza. The models are simple in the sense that they do not include many of the heterogeneities that may affect disease dynamics. These heterogeneities include age-dependent transmission rate, multiple viral strains (including drug-resistant strains), age or spatial variations in contact patterns, etc. We have previously studied the effects of some of these heterogeneities on the disease dynamics (2, (11) (12) (13) (14) . The results presented here suggest that although vaccination and drug treatment will help reduce the disease prevalence in the case of constant transmission rate, their benefits can be compromised if the transmission rate is seasonally forced.",

We demonstrated that when the transmission rate \u03b2 is constant and when vaccination and treatment are available at the beginning of an epidemic, the disease prevalence always decreases with control efforts by increasing the proportion of population vaccinated and/or treated, and by improving the efficacy of vaccines. The main reason for this is that in this case, the control efforts will reduce the reproduction number < c , which determines the severity of the disease outbreak (see Figs. 3, 5, and 6).",

Although more theoretical studies are needed to better understand how periodic forcing may affect the disease dynamics in general, some preliminary observations can be made based on our simulations.

It demonstrates changes in epidemic outcomes for two different values of initial fraction of infected individuals, I 0 /N=10 7 (a and c) and I 0 /N=10 8 (b and d). The model used is (2.5) with f 0 =0, p 0 =0.1, t 0 =30, and t v =0.

These scenarios are based Plots of epidemic curves and cumulative infections for different values of t 0 . These plots show the dramatic effect that the start time of an epidemic (t 0 ) can have on its progression in a periodic environment given by the SIR model (2.1) with initial conditions (2.2), where I 0 =1 and N=10 7 . From the plots in a and c we observe that when t 0 =30, vaccination reduced both the peak size and the peak time although there is not much delay in the peak time. However, plots in b and d show that, although the size of the first epidemic peak is reduced, a second (and higher) peak is also generated.

These plots of epidemic curves and final epidemic sizes are for the case of t 0 =35 with two values of t v (the time when vaccination begins) under three different levels of vaccination (p 0 ) and no treatment (f 0 =0). The model used is (2.5) with initial conditions (2.6), where I u0 =1 and N=305 million. Notice that there is only a single peak in the epidemic curve in the absence of control (see a); a is for the case of no vaccination (p 0 =0). Two different starting times of vaccination (t v ) are examined: b-d are for t v =60, whereas e-g are for t v =100. For each t v value, three levels of vaccination use are considered: p 0 =0.1 (b and e), p 0 = 0.2 (c and f), and p 0 =0.4 (d and g). The peak of the epidemic curve and the final epidemic size are displayed for each of the scenarios. The following observations can be made. (1)For the earlier start of the vaccination program (t v =60), a lower level of vaccination (p 0 =0.1) may lead to an increased peak and final size (compare the sizes in b with those in a), while a higher level of vaccination (p 0 =0.4) can dramatically decrease the peak and the final size (compare d with a). (2) For the later start of the vaccination program (t v =100), the use of vaccines did not increase the peak or final sizes (see e-g). (3) In all cases illustrated in b and d, the time to epidemic peak is delayed, and more delay in the peak time is expected for higher levels of vaccination use. Other parameter values are the same as before in vaccination use. Simulations illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10 show how the peak and final epidemic sizes may vary with p 0 (the levels of vaccination), f 0 (drug treatment), and t v (the starting time of vaccination).",

Particularly, periodic SIR models can produce epidemic curves with more than one peak; depending on values of mode parameters such as t 0 and \u03b5, the spring epidemic may not reduce the number of susceptibles sufficiently to prevent the epidemic from once again taking off in the autumn (during a favorable time of year when \u03b2(t) begins to rise again).In summary, our model studies suggest that the patterns of disease transmission (e.g., with or without seasonal variations) can have a significant influence on the effectiveness of control and intervention programs. When a disease exhibits periodic patterns in transmission, decisions of public health policies will be particularly important as to how control measures such as vaccination and drug treatment should be implemented. More importantly, mathematical models can be very helpful for understanding complex disease transmission dynamics and for identifying the optimal control strategies.",
