We performed gene expression analysis using microarray to find damage-induced genes after spinal cord injury, and found that Sox11b mRNA is up-regulated at 11 days after injury. However, the functional relevance of Sox11b for regeneration is not known. Here, we report that the up-regulation of Sox11b mRNA after spinal cord injury is mainly localized in ependymal cells lining the central canal and in newly differentiating neuronal precursors or immature neurons. Using an in vivo morpholino-based gene knockout approach, we demonstrate that Sox11b is essential for locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury. In the injured spinal cord, expression of the neural stem cell associated gene Nestin, and the proneural gene Ascl1a (Mash1a), which are involved in the self-renewal and cell fate specification of endogenous neural stem cells, respectively, is regulated by Sox11b. Our data indicate that Sox11b promotes neuronal determination of endogenous stem cells and regenerative neurogenesis following spinal cord injury in the adult zebrafish. Enhancing Sox11b expression to promote proliferation and neurogenic determination of endogenous neural stem cells after injury may be a promising strategy in restorative therapy after spinal cord injury in mammals.",

Therefore, zebrafish have become an attractive model for exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration and adult neurogenesis after spinal cord injury. To analyze the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this intrinsic ability to regenerate we identified damageinduced gene expression changes in the injured spinal cord caudal to the lesion site by microarray expression profiling. This strategy has been used to discover regulated genes in a successfully regenerating adult central nervous system of zebrafish (Veldman et al., 2007) as well as mammalian systems that do not regenerate (Biase et al., 2005; Carmel 2001 ). Using this system, we have identified a large set of genes regulated during spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish, including the transcription factor Sox11b, up-regulated in its expression after spinal cord injury. Since little is known of the role of Sox11b in central nervous system (CNS) regeneration, we chose to investigate its function in zebrafish spinal cord injury.",

Sox proteins bind DNA sequences with an HMG domain, allowing them to function as transcription factors. According to the sequence homologies of the HMG domain, Sox proteins are divided into groups A-H (Bowles et al., 2000; Schepers et al., 2002) and are expressed in a tissue-specific manner during development, in which the Cgroup Sox11 (including two gene duplicates in zebrafish, Sox11a and Sox11b (Martino et al., 2000) ) is mainly expressed in neural progenitor cells that have already been committed to neuronal differentiation (Kamachi et al., 2000; Uwanogho et al., 1995) . In chicken, maturing neurons express Sox11 transiently as they leave the neural epithelium (Uwanogho et al., 1995) . In mice, the developing CNS prominently expresses Sox11 genes but the expression is down-regulated as neuronal development progresses (Hargrave et al., 1997; Southard-Smith et al., 1998) . The expression of Sox11 remains at a very low level in adult mice, being prominently expressed in the neurogenic areas of the adult brain (Haslinger et al., 2009) . The specific expression patterns of Sox11 genes suggest that they function at early stages of neural development, especially in the transition from immature to mature neurons. Much evidence shows that Sox11b expression is highly up-regulated in developing retinal ganglion cells of zebrafish during regeneration of the optic nerve (Veldman et al., 2007) and in dorsal root ganglion neurons after mouse sciatic nerve transection (Tanabe et al., 2003) . Transient forebrain ischemia enhances Sox11 gene expression in the brain regions where neuronal progenitors and immature neurons are enriched (Kim et al., 2008) . Given that specific developmental regulatory genes functioning during neural development are also present in endogenous neural stem cells and can be induced after injury (Veldman et al., 2007; Schepers et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2008; Bergsland et al., 2006) , we wished to explore the function of Sox11b during endogenous regeneration after spinal cord injury.",

Moreover, Sox11b regulates the expression of neural stem cell associated gene Nestin and the proneural gene Achaete-scute complex-like 1a (Ascl1a, also named Mash1a) in the injured spinal cord. Most importantly, morpholino-based suppression of Sox11b expression specifically impairs locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury. These data suggest that Sox11b is a critical transcription factor that contributes to regenerative neurogenesis via endogenous stem cells after spinal cord injury in the adult zebrafish.",

We chose 4 hrs, 12 hrs and 11 days post-injury for harvesting the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site because these times represent the acute and the more chronic response phases of the spinal cord to the injury. A large list of genes was selected by two-way ANOVA as differentiated by treatment (i.e., injury vs. control, 530 genes), time (3,096 genes) or an interaction of the two (6 genes) (GEO accession number: GSE20460. The link for the GEO dataset: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE20460). We explored the literature on many of these genes, and noted that Sox11b (Agilent probe ID A_15_P102878) was of particular interest in the context of regeneration after spinal cord injury. The change in Sox11b expression after injury is shown in Fig. 1A . Microarray analysis indicated that the expression of Sox11b was similar to control during acute injury phase time points (4 hrs or 12 hrs) but had increased significantly by 11 days post injury, with a 2.44 \u00b1 0.117 fold change from sham-injured control at this time (1.00 \u00b1 0.009; p<0.01; Fig. 1A , Table 1 ). qPCR analysis confirmed the array results, producing 1.66 \u00b1 0.135 fold (Table 2) or 1.83 \u00b1 0.156 fold from control in two separate sets of fish. While this effect of injury is not large, it was highly reproducible and statistically significant in every assay that was performedperhaps only a subset of cells in the dissected tissue express Sox11b and therefore the effect has been diluted in the dissected tissue samples. Examining ANOVA-selected array results by K-means clustering (not shown), GAP-43 mRNA was found to cluster with Sox11b, suggesting that the pattern of regulation of Sox11b after spinal cord injury was similar to other regeneration-associated genes. We chose to identify cells expressing Sox11b to better understand its function after injury.",

At 3 and 11 days post-injury, the hybridization signal for Sox11b mRNA continued to increase relative to sham-injured controls. In addition, more Sox11b positive cells appeared in the gray matter compared to 12 hrs post-injury samples ( Fig. 1B-J) . At 6 weeks post-injury, Sox11b expression returned to normal levels (Data not shown). BrdU, a thymidine analog that is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells during S-phase, labels mitotic cells. We used pulse labeling with BrdU to find newly generated cells in the spinal cord. At 3 days post-injury, the number of BrdU-positive proliferative cells increased compared to shaminjured controls, mainly in ependymal cells lining the central canal ( Fig. 2A, 2B) . Moreover, double labeling of BrdU and HuC/D, a marker of neuronally committed stem cells or immature neurons (Marusich et al., 1994) , showed that the immunofluorescence signal for BrdU co-localized on some ependymal cells (Fig. 2C) .

Therefore we investigated the relationship between injury-induced Sox11b expression and the neural stem cell associated gene, Nestin. qPCR showed that expression of Nestin mRNA in the injured spinal cords did not differ from sham-injured controls at 4 and 12 hrs post-injury. But at 11 days post-injury, Nestin expression significantly increased in injured spinal cords compared to sham-injured controls ( Table 2 ). The in situ hybridization signal was clearly visible at 3 and 11 days post-injury, while hybridization signals were very weak both at 12 hrs post-injury and in the shaminjured controls (Fig. 4A-F) . Significantly, Nestin was also primarily expressed in ependymal cells lining the central canal and in some cells located in the spinal cord parenchyma (Fig. 4A-F) , closely resembling the expression pattern of Sox11b. Double staining with in situ hybridization for Nestin and immunohistochemistry for HuC/D showed that only few cells were co-labeled. One possible explanation is that Nestin and HuC/D are markers of different kinds of cells. Nestin is a marker for neural stem cells, whereas HuC/D is a marker for neuronally committed stem cells or immature neurons. Only few neuronally committed stem cells were co-labeled with nestin and HuC/D. Taken together, these results reveal that Sox11b is expressed both in neural stem cells and neuronally committed stem cells after injury.",

At 3 days post-injury, Sox11b antisense morpholino treatment significantly reduced Ascl1a expression compared with standard control morpholino-treated spinal cords (Table 3) . At 11 days post-injury, Sox11b antisense morpholino treatment had no effect on Ascl1a mRNA expression (Table 3) .

In addition, Ascl1a antisense morpholino-treated spinal cord exhibited an increase in the expression of Nestin (Table 4 ). Double staining by in situ hybridization for Ascl1a and immunofluorescence staining for HuC/D indicated that Ascl1a was expressed in cells of the spinal cord parenchyma, co-localizing with the immunofluorescence signal for HuC/D (Fig. 6H-K) .

Some BrdU-positive ependymal cells express the marker of newly-differentiating neuronal precursors, suggesting that ependymal cells serve as stem cells and differentiate into neurons after spinal cord injury. Previous data have indicated that cells with astroglial characteristics act as stem cells in the adult CNS of mammals (Alvarez-Buylla et al., 2001) . More recent findings demonstrate that stem cells in the adult zebrafish cerebellum are not typical glia but instead exhibit neuroepithelial cell characteristics (Kaslin et al., 2009) . Similarly, in the spinal cord injury model of adult zebrafish, ependymo-radial glial cells are progenitor cells for spinal motoneurons (Reimer et al., 2008) . Genetic fate mapping was used to characterize candidate neural stem cells within the ependymal cell population, which differentiated into astrocytes/oligodendrocytes and migrated towards the injury site to participate in regeneration after spinal cord injury in the mouse (Meletis et al., 2008) . Our results are in agreement with these findings, highlighting that ependymal cells are likely to be endogenous neural stem cells mobilized after spinal cord injury.",

Treatment of Sox11b antisense morpholino reduced BrdU-positive cells in the wall of the central canal and inhibited migration of newly generated cells toward the gray matter. Previous studies indicate that Sox11 expression is strictly confined to doublecortin-expressing neuronally committed precursors in the adult rodent brain (Haslinger et al., 2009 ). More importantly, reducing expression of Sox11b in adult zebrafish impairs locomotor recovery after injury. Together, these results suggest that Sox11b, up-regulated in ependymal cells and newly-generated neurons in the spinal cord, plays an important role in regulating endogenous proliferation and neurogenic determination after spinal cord injury, which contribute to the locomotor recovery in the adult zebrafish.",

            "text": "Treatment with Sox11b antisense morpholino dramatically reduced Nestin expression after spinal cord injury. Given that Nestin marks immature neural cells in the developing nervous system or neural stem cells in the adult central nervous system of zebrafish (Mahler and Driever, 2007) , the ability of Sox11b to regulate Nestin expression suggests that it influences endogenous neural stem cell fate. The regenerative process after spinal cord injury is likely to recapitulate at least to some extent neural development during embryogenesis. Sox11, with its HMG domain, is a key player in the regulation of embryonic nervous system development and determination of the cell fate, especially in the developmental stage from immature to mature neurons (Uwanogho et al., 1995; Hargrave et al., 1997; Southard-Smith et al., 1998) . The HMG domain regulates target gene expression by pairing with specific partner factors (Kamachi et al., 2000) . Much evidence indicates that SOX and POU gene families interact with each other during development (Kamachi et al., 2000; Kuhlbrodt et al., 1998; Dailey and Basilico, 2001; Wilson and Koopman, 2002) . Recent studies also indicate that an enhancer, located in the second intron and including a POU factor binding site (Josephson et al., 1998; Lothian and Lendahl, 1997) , regulates Nestin expression in the neural tube during rat embryonic development. Furthermore, a potential Sox protein binding site is present in the 258bp mouse Nestin enhancer, immediately upstream of the POU binding site. Combinations of Sox2-POU and Sox11-POU activate Nestin transcription by binding to its enhancer in mice (Tanaka et al., 2004; Jin et al., 2006) . The identity of the member of POU family that cooperates with Sox11b to activate Nestin expression is not known. Our finding of the similarity of spatio-temporal increasing co-expression of Sox11b and Oct4 of the POU family in injured spinal cords supports the view that Sox11b associates with POU family members (of which one member is Oct4, POU5F1, POUV) to regulate Nestin expression after spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish.",

Our data show that spinal cord injury induces Ascl1a expression in a similar expression pattern as Sox11b. Ascl1a expression, however, is strong in cells of the spinal cord parenchyma and weak in ependymal cells lining the central canal. Since Ascl1a is involved in differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons and suppressing expression of Ascl1a increased expression of Nestin, a reasonable interpretation is that the more neuronally differentiated neural stem cells express AscI1a in the injured spinal cord. Moreover, suppressing Sox11b expression reduced Ascl1a expression. These results suggest that Ascl1a may be a downstream target gene of Sox11b and that Ascl1a is not involved in the maintenance of the endogenous neural stem cell pool. After spinal cord injury, up-regulation of Sox11b may then regulate neuronal determination in stem cells, and Sox11b-induced up-regulation of Ascl1a expression may contribute to neurogenesis by promoting neuronal differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells. The functional relationships between Sox11 and Ascl1 are, however, poorly understood. Some studies report that proneural bHLH proteins, such as Ngn2 and Ascl1, induce Sox4/11 expression (Bergsland et al., 2006) . Therefore, more studies are needed to establish the functional relationship between Sox11b and Ascl1a.",

In line with this view is that in adult zebrafish Sox11b expression is enhanced after spinal cord injury and mobilizes endogenous neural stem cells to contribute to neurogenesis by promoting neuronal determination. Stem cell availability and neuronal-differentiating potential may be critical factors for determining regeneration after spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish. In mammals, the capability of constitutive proliferation and neurogenesis is limited, correlating with the capacity to regenerate after injury. Moreover, in mammals progenitor cells are thought to be responsible for the generation of astrocytes, leading to the formation of an inhibitory tissue environment for neurogenesis (Horner et al., 2000; Mothe and Tator, 2005) . As shown in our study, Sox11b participates in the transcriptional regulation of specific gene expression (including Nestin and Ascl1a) to organize a distinct neurogenic niche containing neural stem cells that differentiate into immature neurons in adult zebrafish. Therefore, enhancing Sox11b expression to promote proliferation and neurogenic determination of endogenous neural stem cells after injury may be a promising strategy in restorative therapy after spinal cord injury in mammals.",
