            "text": "Historically, a wide range of viral infections, including flaviviruses, alphaviruses, rhabdoviruses, arenaviruses, reoviruses, and paramyxoviruses, have been identified in bats. 60 More recently, a number of emerging zoonotic viruses have been detected in bats. 32 These include Hantaan virus, isolated from the common serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) and the horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumepuinum) in Korea; Rift Valley fever virus, isolated from the bats Micropteropus pusillus and Hipposideros albae in the Republic of Guinea; a strain of yellow fever isolated from an Epomophorus Old World fruit bat in Ethiopia; and serologic evidence of Venezuelan equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and eastern equine encephalitis viruses in bats in Guatemala. 32 Although bat-variant rabies has long been recognized in the United States, the prevalence of human rabies cases attributed to that variant has increased in recent years. 46 Most recently, strong evidence shows that horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) may be the source of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. 40,42 B ats are an extraordinary group of mammals; not only are they the only mammals capable of sustained flight, but they are also found in almost all habitats, having a worldwide distribution, except for the highest mountains and extreme polar regions. Bats also occupy a diverse array of ecologic niches and contribute significantly to mammalian diversity, with more than 1000 species. 39 Bats are known to host six paramyxoviruses: Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Menangle virus, Tioman virus, bat parainfluenza virus, and Mapuera virus. At least three of these are able to infect humans and domestic animals. Ever-increasing human encroachment on natural habitats, combined with the ability of some bats to adapt to anthropogenic environmental changes, has led to increased contact between bats and domestic animals and humans. This may be a key reason for the repeated emergence of several paramyxoviruses from bats in recent years. These viruses have been able to jump the species barrier, and in the case of Nipah virus in Bangladesh, then spread from person to person.",

BREED Also, Old World fruit bats of the genera Hypsignathus, Epomops, and Myonycteris may be natural hosts of Ebola virus, as found in Gabon and Republic of Congo. 41 Bats may travel hundreds of kilometers (or miles) in a matter of days. Besides having significant implications for disease spread, this also suggests that populations of pathogens carried by bats are likely to be relatively homogenous across wide geographic areas. 9 Studies of Old World fruit bats using satellite telemetry have shown that individuals can travel more than 2000 km in 1 year and traverse significant bodies of open sea, such as the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea and the Strait of Malacca between peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra (www.henipavirus.com) 10,61 (Figure 28-1). These long-distance movements may transmit pathogens over great distances and enable exchange between bat populations on different land masses.",

A metapopulation may exist where a spatial mosaic involves a constellation of subpopulations of which, at any given time, some are susceptible, some infected, and some immune to a particular disease. 43 This is beneficial for genetic diversity and may permit pathogens, particu-larly viruses, to persist in a species with a total population that would otherwise be too small to maintain the disease. 8 This results in these species having considerable potential to act as vectors for, and disseminators of, viruses and other pathogens.",

            "text": "In September 1994, an outbreak of severe respiratory disease of horses occurred in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra in eastern Australia (Queensland) 48 ( Figure  28 -2). The index case was a pregnant Thoroughbred mare, and 16 other horses at two sites showed signs of loss of appetite, dyspnea, and copious frothy nasal discharge. Twelve of the affected horses died a few days after the onset of signs. 7 Two people who had close contact with the index case also became infected. One of them, a stable worker, developed flulike signs and recovered. The other person, a horse trainer, showed rapid development of respiratory illness and died 11 days later. 58 It was thought that the pattern of disease in the horses reflected a point source of infection, and that all other cases were a direct result of transmission from the pregnant mare. 7 A range of pathogens and toxins were investigated and excluded from the diagnosis. A novel virus was cultured from the lungs of five of the affected horses and from the kidneys of the fatal human case. 49 The virus showed characteristics suggesting it belonged to the family Paramyxoviridae, although there was minimal cross-reactivity between the virus and a range of antisera to other paramyxoviruses. The virus showed 50% homology of the partial M protein gene sequence of several morbilliviruses and thus was initially called equine morbillivirus (EMV). 48 The name was subsequently changed to Hendra virus (HeV) when it became apparent that horses were not the natural host for the virus and that it did not belong in the genus Morbillivirus.",

In the course of the outbreak, 265 humans were infected, 105 fatally. 15 Infected pigs were identified as the primary source of human infection, and over 1 million pigs were culled to control the outbreak. Wildlife surveillance identified the Malayan flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus) and island flying fox (Pteropus hypomelanus) as probable natural hosts of NiV. 38 Subsequent studies have also found serologic evidence of NiV infection in the Malayan flying fox, island flying fox, and Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei) in Thailand, in Lyle's flying fox in Cambodia, and in the Indian flying fox (Pteropus giganteus) in Bangladesh. 35,51,63 NiV has strong serologic and sequence similarities to HeV and is the second member of the genus Henipavirus. 64 Subsequent to NiV's emergence in Malaysia, five outbreaks of NiV-associated disease in humans were described in Bangladesh between April 2001 and February 2005. 4-6,35 As of 11 February 2005, a total of 122 cases had been recognized by the Bangladesh Directorate of Health Services, at least 78 (64%) of which were fatal. A number of the characteristics of the Bangladesh outbreaks were similar to the outbreak in Malaysia: delayed recognition, a primary presentation of humans with fever and CNS signs, and a high casefatality rate. In marked contrast to the Malaysian outbreak, however, infection in humans was not associated with disease in pigs, and evidence indicated horizontal human transmission. Further, the pattern of the Bangladesh outbreaks suggests a sporadic, geographically scattered introduction of infection to humans. Nucleotide sequence data also support a different epidemiology in Bangladesh. Data obtained from human cases in Malaysia suggest a single source of human infection from the porcine amplifying host. 1, 11, 15 Data from Bangladesh cases formed a cluster clearly distinct from the Malaysian sequences, but differed from each other by approximately 0.8%, suggesting possibly multiple introductions of virus into humans. 30 The pathologic effects of NiV in terrestrial mammals are similar to those of HeV, with infection resulting in a systemic vasculitis and significant pathology of the lung and CNS. 34, 66 In contrast to HeV, however, viral antigen is often found in bronchial and alveolar epithelium. NiV has not been associated with clinical disease in flying foxes. 20",

Such bridges typically result from changes to the agent, the host, or the environment. The close RNA sequence match among flying fox, livestock, and human isolates of Hendra and Nipah viruses suggests that emergence is more likely associated with ecologic changes that have promoted contact between bats and livestock, rather than with genetic change leading to increased virulence. 42 Available data on many flying fox species suggest that populations in Australia and Southeast Asia are declining, with disruption occurring throughout their range (Figures 28-6 and 28-7) . In Southeast Asia, anthropogenic activities (primarily habitat destruction and hunting) constitute the major threats. Deforestation, whether for agricultural land, commercial logging, or urban development, is widespread and results in loss or abandonment of roosting sites and loss of feeding habitats. This habitat loss caused by clearing is often exacerbated by tropical storms because the remnant forest may be particularly prone to high-wind damage. Hunting, whether for consumption, sport, or crop protection, at both a local and a commercial level, results in the abandonment of roost and feeding sites. 47 A scenario thus emerges of flying fox populations under stress with altered foraging and behavioral patterns, of niche expansion, and of closer proximity to humans. In Australia the geographic redistribution of roosting sites has been increasingly into urban areas in recent decades. 28",

Quarantine of infected premises, movement controls on stock, and disinfection have so far proved effective. 7 Veterinarians involved in these disease investigations are advised to wear appropriate protective equipment and to use a limited necropsy approach, because horses have been the source of infection for all four human cases. Putative risk factors for infection in horses appear to be age (>8 years old), breed (Thoroughbred), housing (paddocked), season (late gestation or birthing season of local flying fox populations), and the presence of food trees favored by flying foxes in the index-case paddock. 23 A considerable research focus on the ecology of HeV has yet to define the route of virus excretion or any temporal pattern of infection in flying foxes. This information and knowledge of the actual mode of flying fox-to-horse transmission would facilitate a risk management approach to spillover infection in horses.",

The pattern of on-farm infection was consistent with respiratory transmission; between-farm spread was generally associated with the movement of pigs. Human infections were predominantly attributed to contact with live pigs; none was attributed to contact with bats. 15 Horizontal transmission was not a feature of infection in humans. Recommended host management strategies primarily targeted pig-to-pig transmission. 24 Although strategies directed at the flying fox-pig interface are limited by the incomplete knowledge of the ecology of NiV, several simple on-farm measures may be taken to reduce the likelihood of spillover events. The removal of fruit orchards and other food trees favored by flying foxes from the immediate vicinity of pig farms greatly reduces the probability of flying fox-pig contact. Similarly, the wire screening of open-sided pig sheds is a simple and inexpensive strategy to prevent direct contact between flying foxes and pigs. Indirect contact (with flying fox urine or feces or partially eaten fruit) may be avoided by ensuring roof runoff does not enter pig pens. 14 Henipavirus spillover to domestic animals may be effectively controlled by the methods previously mentioned, but events in Bangladesh warn against complacency in elimination of the zoonotic risk of henipaviruses using these methods alone.",
