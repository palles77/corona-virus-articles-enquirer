Previous studies indicated that a 719-nt subgenomic minigenome (DENV-MINI) is an efficient template for translation and (\u00c0) strand RNA synthesis in vitro. We performed a detailed structural analysis of DENV-MINI RNA, combining chemical acylation techniques, Pb 2+ ion-induced hydrolysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Our results highlight protein-independent 5 0 -3 0 terminal interactions involving hybridization between recognized cisacting motifs. Probing analyses identified tandem dumbbell structures (DBs) within the 3 0 terminus spaced by single-stranded regions, internal loops and hairpins with embedded GNRA-like motifs. Analysis of conserved motifs and top loops (TLs) of these dumbbells, and their proposed interactions with downstream pseudoknot (PK) regions, predicted an H-type pseudoknot involving TL1 of the 5 0 DB and the complementary region, PK2. As disrupting the TL1/PK2 interaction, via 'flipping' mutations of PK2, previously attenuated DENV replication, this pseudoknot may participate in regulation of RNA synthesis. Computer modeling implied that this motif might function as autonomous structural/regulatory element. In addition, our studies targeting elements of the 3 0 DB and its complementary region PK1 indicated that communication between 5 0 -3 0 terminal regions strongly depends on structure and sequence composition of the 5 0 cyclization region.",

These motifs are proposed to interact with their complementary elements positioned at the 5 0 terminus, the 5 0 CS, the 5 0 UAR and the 5 0 DAR, resulting in long-range RNA-RNAmediated genome circularization (5, 6, 11) . Following hybridization of the 5 0 and 3 0 termini, the DENV genome has been proposed to endure extensive rearrangements of both UTRs, opening of the 3 0 SL to form an extended duplex with the 5 0 UAR and formation of a doublestranded region via 5 0 and 3 0 CS interactions (12) . As a result, the viral NS5 polymerase initially docked at the 5 0 stem-loop A (SLA) would be relocated to the structurally reorganized 3 0 terminus, allowing launch of (\u00c0) strand synthesis (6, 11) . Additional structural motifs of the 3 0 -UTR have also been shown to modulate DENV molecular processes. Phylogenetic comparisons have suggested that the tandem, almost identical dumbbell structures, designated 3 0 and 5 0 DB, might participate in regulation of RNA synthesis and translation (13) (14) (15) . The leftmost hairpins of both DBs contain a set of identical five nucleotide motifs, referred to as TL1 and TL2 (5 0 -GCUGU-3 0 ). The top loop (TL) regions have been suggested to pair with complementary motifs (PK2 and PK1, respectively) nested within A-rich sequences flanking both DBs (13, 16) . The TL1/PK2 and TL2/PK1 interactions would promote formation of two pseudoknots, which have been proposed to modulate both viral replication (15) and translation (8) .",

We combined selective 2 0 -hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) with Pb 2+ ion-induced hydrolysis and site-directed mutagenesis of DENV-MINI mutant RNAs to examine the previously proposed cis-acting RNA motifs and their potential binding partners, as well as identify long-range tertiary interactions between them. Our findings provide new insights into the secondary and tertiary interactions of DENV-MINI RNA and contribute to the understanding of viral RNA replication.",

Folded RNA was divided into two equal portions (72 ml) treated with 8 ml of 30mM N-methylisatoic anhydride (NMIA) in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (+) or DMSO alone (\u00c0). Tubes were incubated at 37 C for 50 min, and RNA was precipitated at \u00c020 C with 60 ng/ml glycogen, 0.3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 3 volumes of cold ethanol. Precipitated RNA was collected by centrifugation, washed once in 70% ethanol and resuspended in 10 ml of water. Five picomoles of Cy5-labeled (for NMIA-modified samples) or Cy5.5-labeled (for unmodified samples) primer S720 or S440 (Supplementary Table S1) in 7 ml H 2 O was annealed to the RNA at 85 C for 1 min, 60 C for 5 min and 35 C for 5 min.

RNA was hydrolyzed with 200 mM NaOH (4 M) for 5 min at 95 C, and reactions were neutralized with an equivalent volume of HCl (2 M). Sequencing ladders were prepared using the Epicentre cycle sequencing kit according to the manufacturer's instructions and primers labeled with WellRed D2 and LicorIR-800 dyes. Modified and control samples were mixed with the sequencing ladders, precipitated as described earlier in the text, dried and resuspended in 40 ml of deionized formamide. Primer extension products were analyzed on a Beckman CEQ8000 Genetic Analysis Systems as described previously (19) . Electropherograms were processed using the SHAPEfinder program, following the software developer's protocol and included the required pre-calibration for matrixing and mobility shift for each set of primers as described (20, 21) . Briefly, the area under each negative peak was subtracted from that of the corresponding positive peak. The resulting peak area difference at each nucleotide position was then divided by the average of the highest 8% of peak area differences, calculated after discounting any results greater than the third quartile plus 1.5\u00c2 the interquartile range.

Two regions that exhibit high sensitivity to NMIA modifications were located within the 5 0 stem-loop A (SLA), A31-U34 and U48-A50, which corresponded to the TL and the side stem-loop (SSL), respectively. Three helical regions of 5 0 SLA, U3-G9:C64-G70, C11-G15:A56-G61 and C24-A29:U35-G40, were insensitive to NMIA. The remainder of the reactive nucleotides were situated within the U62-U63 bulge and internal loops G17-A19 and G22-A23. Downstream of SLA, the oligoU tract spanning nt U71-U80 was predicted to be singlestranded. This region was followed by the unreactive double-stranded upstream of AUG region (dsUAR), formed via a long-range interaction between the 5 0 -and 3 0 -UTRs (nt A81-G96 and nt C638-U654). Here, the only reactive residues occupied the vicinity of bulge (C646), mismatch (G84) and the closing base pair of the helix. The internal loop enclosing the first AUG codon (nt A97-A104 and G631-C637) was predicted to be singlestranded followed by the double-stranded 6-nt long downstream of UAR region (DAR) containing reactive residues within the mismatch (A108) and the closing pairs of the helices. The capsid hairpin (cHP, A115-U133) (12), displayed an unreactive stem followed by a 7-nt reactive apical loop. As suggested by previous chemical probing studies, the 5 0 -3 0 terminal interactions were mediated by base pairing between the 5 0 and 3 0 cyclization sequences, which formed 11-nt double-stranded cyclization region (CS) (U134-G144 and C614-A624) (12) . Subsequently, two short hairpins that formed downstream of the 5 0 -3 0 CS were found within the sequence of the 5 0 -end of the capsid protein gene. One contains a purine-rich and moderately reactive apical loop (A152-U159) and the other with a reactive 3-nt loop and A-C mismatch (G165-C185). Both hairpins were followed by 5-nt helical region (A190-U194 and A444-U448), which provided additional linkage between the 5 0 and 3 0 termini.",

            "text": "With regard to the 3 0 -UTR, SHAPE provided information on the 3 0 SL structure, obscured only at the extreme 3 0 terminus because of the presence of hybridized primer ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1 ). The 3 0 SL displayed NMIA sensitivity at the apical loop (A674-C680) and insensitivity at its leftmost side. The fact that this large 79-nt stem-loop was followed with reactive stretch of 3 nt (C655-U657) and unreactive dsUAR region (nucleotides A81-G96 and nucleotides C638-U654), enforced the proposed conformation. Previous phylogenetic comparative studies suggested that the 3 0 -UTR enclosed two almost identical DBs that might assume a pseudoknot conformation with their downstream complementary regions (13, 16) . SHAPE data confirmed the presence of both, and in addition provided detailed insight into their secondary structure. The 3 0 DB contained a 6-bp unreactive stem (U536-G541 and C598-A603) and two hairpins on opposing ends (G547-U571 and G584-C597). The apical loop of the leftmost hairpin incorporated the highly reactive TL2 sequence (G558-U562). The reactivity of TL2, combined with the fact that its downstream complementary partner PK1 (A613-C617) was involved in formation of 5 0 -3 0 CS region, would likely prevent the previously suggested TL2/PK1 pseudoknot interaction (13, 16) . Regarding the 5 0 DB, it likewise contained an unreactive stem (G449-G454 and C511-C516) and two hairpins on opposing ends (C462-G482 and G497-C510). Here, however, the apical loop of the leftmost hairpin incorporating the TL1 sequence (G467-G477), although predicted to be single-stranded, harbored mainly unreactive nucleotides. The fact that its complementary partner PK2 was likewise unreactive and enclosed within single-stranded loop (G526-C530) was strongly suggestive of a TL1/ PK2 base pairing interaction ( Figure 2 ) (13, 16) . In addition, both DBs comprised reactive bulges (A491-C496 and A578-A583) and moderately NMIA-sensitive purine-rich internal loops. One of the internal loops of the 3 0 DB (G572-A575) was insensitive to modification as it contained a -GGAA-motif. Such -GNRA-tetraloops represent a unique fold, which include a trans sugar edge/ Hoogsteen edge G \u00b7 A pair between the first and the last residues, a hydrogen bond between the 2 0 -OH of G and the N7 of A and 3 0 stacking of all tetraloop bases except the G. This architecture would account for lack of reactivity towards NMIA (31) .",

            "text": "The region upstream of the DBs is often referred to as the variable region (VR), as its sequence differs between DENV serotypes ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure  S1 ) (33) . Our probing analysis indicated its propensity to form long single-stranded stretches (A274-A291, U364-A376, G418-C424 and U439-A443). One of the loops (U439-A443), composed almost exclusively of adenine residues, was mainly NMIA unreactive. It was shown previously that consecutive adenine bases in single-stranded regions are often involved in stacking interactions, which would account for their inaccessibility towards NMIA modification (34, 35) . The 3 0 -UTR region also contained two stable tetraloops (C352-G363 and C425-G438). As expected, the -GNRA-tetraloop (C425-G438), restricted by extensive stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions, was NMIA-insensitive (31) . On the other hand, the -CAAG-tetraloop (C352-G363) behaved differently. Here, only its GC residues showed little reactivity, which could be interpreted as formation of an intraloop G \u00b7 C base pair, whereas its AA residues were reactive. The apical loops of two other hairpins (G377-C392 and G396-C412) showed strong NMIA reactivity. Also, an extended hairpin containing internal asymmetric loop (A296-U301 and U345-G346), a bulge (C307-A313) and A-rich, moderately reactive apical loop (A323-A331) was predicted to form between nucleotides G292-C350. Another long hairpin (U206-A267) with a reactive apical loop (A233-A241) and two reactive internal loops (G218-A222 and C252-A256; A227-A229 and G245-A247) enclosed a linker sequence that stretched from A227-G268.",

In both cases, NMIA reactivity profiles for the entire 719-nt DENV-MINI indicated minor 'off site' changes mainly occurring within the DB structures, whereas the 5 0 portion of the DENV-MINI was not significantly affected (Supplementary Figure S3) . Despite this, the RNAstructure algorithm, when provided with pseudo energy constrains retrieved from LNA experiments, predicted the identical DENV-MINI secondary structure (data not shown). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that global DENV-MINI RNA folding might be altered by LNAs hybridization on a higher level that chemical probing cannot address.

To disrupt potential TL1/PK2 and TL2/PK1 base pairing, they introduced point mutations by 'flipping' the corresponding sequences (TLs 5 0 -GCUGU-3 0 !5 0 -UGUCG-3 0 and PKs 5 0 -GCAGC-3 0 !5 0 -CGACG-3) in the context of the DENV2 replicon expressing Rluc. This strategy showed that the PK2 Flip mutation attenuated DENV Rluc replication, but not translation, suggesting that PK2 region is crucial for viral RNA synthesis. As the DENV2 Rluc replicon encompassed the same cis-acting regulatory sequences as the DENV-MINI RNA used in our studies, we next sought to address the structure-function relation of PK2 mutations in the context of DENV-MINI RNA.",

Also, introducing compensatory mutations in the 5 0 CS (mutant TL2 Flip PK1 Flip -3) to restore base pairing between the 5 0 -3 0 CS failed to improve replication, from which strong structure-and sequence-specific requirements for TL2 and PK1 function in DENV RNA replication have been proposed (8) .

Also, the DAR region (A107-C109) and 5 0 CS (A137-C142) were susceptible to cleavage, which agreed with their single-stranded character. With regard to the 3 0 -UTR, moderate hydrolysis was noted within the stem of the extended 3 0 SL, as it contained numerous bulges and loops that relaxed its overall stability. Pb 2+ cleavage was most pronounced within the apex of the 3 0 SL (A674-C675). The 3 0 CS region containing the flipped PK1 exhibited complementarity between TL2 and PK1. Also, SHAPEassisted prediction of RNA folding showed that PK1 was embedded in single-stranded region available for pairing with TL2. It was suggested previously that releasing PK1 from the 5 0 -3 0 CS region provides the switch between the translation and replication mode of the DENV genome by rendering PK1 available for a pseudoknot interaction with TL2 (13) . In our study, the RNA secondary structure predicted for TL2 Flip PK1 Flip mutant resembled the structure of the PK1 Flip mutant ( Supplementary Figures S10 and S11) . Residues of neither PK1 nor TL2 displayed a change in NMIA sensitivity, contradicting the implication that TL2 is involved in long-range interactions with PK1 in the context of DENV-MINI construct. Pb 2+ -induced hydrolysis of TL2 Flip PK1 Flip mutant provided a pattern of cleavage comparable with that obtained for the PK1 Flip mutant (Supplementary Figure S12) , the only difference being lower intensity of hydrolysis within the internal loops and rightmost apical loops of both DBs.",

In addition, positioning of the hybridized 5 0 -3 0 termini and the TL1/PK2 pseudoknot on opposite termini of the DENV-MINI RNA is consistent with the two domains playing independent structural/regulatory roles in DENV replication. TL2 of the 3 0 DB is likewise spatially separated from other structural motifs, suggesting a functional role for TL2 that does not involve interactions with other RNA elements in the context. The 3 0 DB itself is linked to adjacent segments of the DENV-MINI RNA by relatively long, presumably flexible segments of single-stranded RNA. It is conceivable that a second TL2/PK1 pseudoknot could be formed by rotation of the 3 0 DB motif, thereby bringing TL2 into proximity with PK1. However, such a rearrangement would also require partial dissolution of the hybridized 5 0 -3 0 termini. It is important to note, however, that there is no evidence that base pairing between TL2 and PK1 occurs in the DENV-MINI RNA in vitro. In general, although caution must be exercised in interpreting these 3D structural data, the model presented here serves to provide plausible insights into how RNA substructures may interact during DENV replication.",

The function(s) assumed by these RNAs are dictated in part by the specific local and long-range RNA interactions investigated in the present study. Our combined SHAPE, aiSHAPE and Pb 2+ -induced cleavage analysis of the DENV-MINI RNA establish the existence of multiple motifs required for initiation of (\u00c0) strand RNA synthesis ( Figure 1B Figure S1 ). Our results have experimentally verified long-range interactions between the 5 0 and 3 0 terminal regions, which involved hybridization between (i) 5 0 -3 0 CS, previously demonstrated to initiate the 5 0 -3 0 long range RNA-RNA hybridization (5, 15) , (ii) the 5 0 -3 0 UAR, required for the correct orientation of the SLA with respect to the 3 0 end (30) and (iii) 5 0 -3 0 DAR, extending the CS-initiated 5 0 -3 0 interaction (11). We have predicted additional regulatory motifs that might contribute to the overall functionality of DENV-MINI RNA. Probing analysis identified tandem DBs spaced by A-rich singlestranded regions in the 3 0 -UTR, as well as internal loops and hairpins with embedded GNRA/GNRA-like motifs within the VR domain ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1 ). These elements may represent candidate assembly sites for proteins, as previous studies identified several host factors that not only bind to DENV UTRs but also actively participate in regulation of replication and translation efficiency (41) (42) (43) (44) . In addition, -GNRAtetraloops could act as 'anchors' by interacting in a sequence-specific manner with motifs at distant locations along the molecule to enhance RNA self-folding (45, 46) .",

Also, the fact that hybridization of LNA/DNA chimeras to either TL1 or PK2 failed to induce extensive structural changes within the interacting 5 0 -3 0 termini (Supplementary Figure  S3) suggests the TL1/PK2 pseudoknot might indeed function as an autonomous element.

A similar hypothesis was proposed based on MPGAfold-directed secondary structure prediction of DENV MINI RNA, which indicated differences in the folding behavior of the two DBs (8) . In the lack of the 5 0 -3 0 communication, it was proposed that TL2 could be available to bind PK1 in the 3 0 DB to form the putative TL2/PK1 pseudoknot (8) .",

It has been shown that 'flipping' of PK2 in the context of luciferase-based DENV2 replicon did not affect translation, but disrupted replication (8) , from which we conclude that the TL1/PK2 pseudoknot participates in regulation of DENV RNA synthesis. It is also possible that the TL1/PK2 pseudoknot might create a critical recognition element for host proteins. Supporting this notion, pseudoknots have been shown to cause distortion of A-form helices, creating a bend in the complex to provide a recognition site for ligands (56) . Also, it was shown that DEAD-box RNA helicase (DDX6) binds to both DBs and their corresponding PKs regions (43) . These authors suggested that the putative pseudoknots might provide assembly sites for DDX6, and that proper assembly of this protein had functional consequences for DENV replication.",

The 5 0 and 3 0 CS became singlestranded, whereas the UAR and DAR, previously required for 5 0 -3 0 communication, became involved in formation of the 5 0 SLB, the 3 0 sHP and an extended 3 0 SL motif. The presence of 5 0 SLB was proposed as specific for the linear conformation of DENV RNA (39) , reducing the ability of the 5 0 UAR to hybridize to the 3 0 partner (12). In addition, the sHP was suggested to fold locally in the linear conformation of DENV RNA (39) . Although its function is uncertain, the sequences within the sHP were proposed to regulate the equilibrium between the DENV RNA alternative conformations for organizing multiple functions of the viral genome.",

Even the presence of compensatory mutations within 5 0 CS (TL2 Flip PK1 Flip -3 mutant) to restore base pairing with PK1 ( Figure 6 and Supplementary Figures S13-S15) did not entirely reinstate the secondary structure of DENV-MINI RNA. Previous studies using DENV-MINI RNA as templates in in vitro RdRp assays have shown that replication of PK1 Flip , TL2 Flip PK1 Flip mutants was significantly affected, supporting the importance of the 5 0 -3 0 CS interaction for RNA synthesis (8) . However, the introduction of compensatory mutations at the 5 0 CS in DENV-MINI TL2 Flip PK1 Flip -3 mutant restored replication to nearly wild-type level. This was in contrast to the effects of the PK1 'flipping' mutations on replication of luciferase-based DENV2 in BHK-21 cells, which showed essentially no replication (8) . Related studies using luciferase containing Dengue virus (15) , Kunjin virus (57) and West Nile virus replicons (58) carrying point mutations at the 3 0 CS are consistent with our observations. In all cases, the altered sequence of 3 0 CS attenuated replication, even when mutations were compensated at the 5 0 CS. Also, a mutation introduced into the 3 0 CS extending the region of complementarity between 5 0 -3 0 CS by one nucleotide was shown to negatively affect replication kinetics of the subgenomic DENV reporter replicon (59) . Apparently, not only the secondary structure of 5 0 -3 0 CS region but also its sequence composition governs the efficiency of RNA synthesis.",

It was suggested previously that PK1 could modulate DENV genome cyclization via either a 5 0 -3 0 CS interaction or by base pairing with TL2 (13, 25) . Also, studies showed that the longdistance 5 0 -3 0 CS complementarity interferes with efficient translation of DENV2 luciferase (LUC) reporter system in Vero cells (25) . It was suggested that the 5 0 -3 0 CS interaction may play role in regulating the transition from the translation to the replication phase of the infection. Thus, we expected that release of PK1 from 5 0 -3 0 CS together with the conserved complementarity between both partners, would support formation of TL2/PK1 pseudoknot. SHAPE analysis, however, indicated no reactivity change within 'flipped' TL2 and PK1 (Supplementary Figures S10 and S11) . As the addition of 'flipping' mutations within TL2 did not cause any further structural rearrangements compared with PK1 Flip mutant (compare Figure 5 and Supplementary Figures S7 and S8) , this would dismiss the involvement of TL2 in tertiary interactions. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that in vivo a TL2/PK1 interaction could be stabilized by participation of host or viral factors for the purpose of other molecular processes, i.e. translation, before the 5 0 -3 0 CS interaction. Indeed, it has been proposed that the viral NS3 helicase can modulate the folding of cis-acting RNA elements via dual RNA unwinding/annealing activities, providing the switch between alternative conformations of the DENV genome (38, 60) .",
