Areas covered: This review covers the manufacture and development of both RI-001 and RI-002, including the selection of plasma donors for IG preparation with high-titers of anti-RSV antibody, in vitro, and preclinical data in the cotton rat model S. hispidus, and clinical trials including Phase II and compassionate use studies of RI-001 and a multi-center, pivotal Phase III study of RI-002 in PIDD patients. Expert commentary: The data demonstrate that RI-002 is efficacious in the prevention and treatment of RSV in preclinical normal and immune suppressed animal models and is safe and efficacious in the treatment of patients with various forms of primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD). This product offers potential advantages over other available IG's for prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients requiring polyclonal immunoglobulin supplementation because of its unique antibody composition. In addition to its enhanced neutralizing anti-RSV activity and its polyclonal IG composition, there is preclinical data to support the use of RI-002 for humoral protection against other respiratory pathogens.",

While regular infusions with IG prevent the vast majority of serious bacterial infections within this population, there is no single prophylactic regimen that provides protection against the wide range of viral pathogens to which these patients are susceptible [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In the USA, there are several commercially available IG products that meet minimum standards of concentrations of antibodies to diphtheria toxoid (\u22651.21 U/mL), measles (\u22650.60 CBER reference), and polio (\u22650.28 CBER reference) viruses in conformance with the US FDA guidance 21CFR 640 subpart J [9] . Although the FDA defines minimum concentrations of these antibodies, standards for antibodies against pathogens that are the most important to PIDD patients are not required. Titers of these antibodies in commercial polyclonal IG vary widely [10, 11] . While the optimal dose of therapeutic polyclonal intravenous IG appears to be specific to the individual patient [4, 12] , increasing IG dosage is associated with better outcomes and a decrease in the incidence of infection [3, 13] . Even with appropriate IG therapy, PIDD patients remain at an increased risk of infection, including those caused by upper and lower respiratory viral pathogens including RSV and influenza.",

At present, the only prophylactic treatment available for RSV infection is palivizumab (Synagis \u00ae , MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD), an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody that is used to confer seasonal passive immunity and has been shown to be effective in preventing RSV-related hospitalizations, particularly in low birthweight infants [15] [16] [17] . The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently revised its recommendation for use guidelines and available evidence suggest that use of this monoclonal antibody for RSV should be reserved only for patients born prematurely under 29 weeks gestation and under 1 year of age. There currently is no approved, recommended treatment for older age groups for the prevention of RSV disease. Although treatment of established disease is primarily supportive care, ribavirin (Virazole \u00ae ) is the only FDA-approved treatment for RSV pulmonary infection in pediatric patients. Presently, the efficacy of ribavirin in RSV treatment is controversial and there is the potential for significant side effects in both patients and caregivers who administer it [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Because ribavirin is costly and must be administered in a hospital-based setting adding to the costs in the context of uncertain efficacy, an alternative therapy is needed. A polyclonal RSV-IVIG product (RespiGam \u00ae , MedImmune Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) enriched for antibodies against RSV derived from plasma donors with high-titers of anti-RSV antibodies was previously available and approved for the same indication as palivizumab, but was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market following approval of palivizumab. RI-002 was developed to meet an unmet medical need to provide both RSV protection and simultaneously supplement humoral immunity in patients with PIDDs or other immune compromised states.",

This hyperimmune globulin product was derived from a plasma pool of only a few hundred donors who had high neutralizing titers of anti-RSV antibody. The product was not developed for, nor was ever intended to be used in PIDD and as such, its manufacturing specifications did not adhere to FDA standards for collection of plasma from at least one thousand donors and was not tested for standard IG potency requirements. The product was never evaluated for efficacy in PIDD populations. Several randomized controlled trials demonstrated the efficacy of this RSV-IVIG product in preventing RSV infection. In a study of 249 infants and children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to congenital heart disease, or prematurity, 750 mg/kg of RespiGam reduced the incidence of lower respiratory tract infections (7 vs. 20 in the control group, p = 0.01), hospitalizations, hospital days, and days in intensive care [25] . In the PREVENT study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study conducted during the 1994-1995 RSV season, administration of 750 mg/ kg RespiGam every 30 days reduced the incidence of hospitalizations due to RSV infection by 41% compared to placebo in 510 children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or a history of prematurity [26] . In addition, administration of RespiGam in the PREVENT study also reduced hospitalization for respiratory illness of any cause by 38% suggesting a protective effect for other, non-RSV-related respiratory tract infections. Additionally, a post hoc analysis of 109 of the 249 children in the Groothuis study demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in episodes of acute otitis media compared to the placebo group (0 vs. 5, p = 0.047) following immunoprophylaxis with 750 mg/kg of RespiGam, suggesting that the protective effects of RSV enriched hyperimmune globulins may not be limited to RSV alone [27] .",

Although specific recommendations for immunocompromised patients cannot be made, children with severe immunodeficiencies (e.g. severe combined immunodeficiency or severe acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) may benefit from immunoprophylaxis. If these infants and children are receiving standard immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) monthly, physicians may consider substituting RSV-IGIV during the RSV season' [28] . This recommendation and subsequent clinical practice failed to consider that RespiGam did not meet 21CFR640 subpart J requirements that are intended to ensure appropriate immunoprophylaxis in this high-risk population. While the product was available, there were numerous published reports regarding the successful use of RespiGam for treatment and prevention of RSV in various at-risk immunocompromised patient populations [25, 27, [29] [30] [31] . There have also been reports that the efficacy of combination therapy of ribavirin + RSV-IVIG may lead to better outcomes than either product used alone [32] . RespiGam was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 2004, at least in part because the newly approved anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, did not require IV access. The discontinuation of RespiGam left a void in the options for RSV immunoprophylaxis, particularly for simultaneous anti-RSV activity and IG supplementation.",

A similar trend was observed in pediatric patients (<18 years old) with survivors receiving RI-001 treatment earlier (19.8 days) than non-survivors (39.5 days) . Similarly, the time from positive RSV test to first treatment with RI-001 was also shorter in survivors (adults, 3.6 days; children, 4.7 days) versus non-survivors (adults, 12.5 days; children, 8.5 days). Of note, RI-001 was associated with significant increases in RSV serum neutralizing antibody titer in a subset of 7 immunocompromised adults with good clinical outcomes that were enrolled in the compassionate use study [35] . These subjects experienced a 3-151-fold rise in anti-RSV antibody titers compared to baseline for up to 30 days posttreatment. Taken together, these data suggest that early intervention with RI-001 is likely to be important in improving survival.

This finding is consistent with results in human infants that indicate that patients with high titers (1:400) of maternally acquired anti-RSV antibodies were less susceptible to RSV disease than infants with anti-RSV serum antibody titers from 1:100 to 1:200 [46] . This correlation suggests that the model can be used to predict the efficacy of immunoprophylaxis in addition to the dose required for immunoprophylaxis in human infants. Both RespiGam and palivizumab were advanced to clinical trials without the need for intermediate studies in nonhuman primates based on data from studies in S. hispidus [38, 39] . To establish the relationship between protective titers in the cotton rat and in vitro microneutralization assays, human IVIG with elevated anti-RSV titers has been tested in animals with a strong correlation observed between neutralizing antibody titers and protection seen in the animal model. Human plasma donors were successfully identified as donors containing high-titer neutralizing anti RSV IG using this microneutralization assay [45] .

Following RSV infection, viral F protein (the target of palivizumab) mediates viral fusion and entry while G protein displays anti-inflammatory effects that dampen the host immune response to infection [47] . As neutralizing antibodies to both viral proteins may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of RI-002, microneutralization assays were conducted to quantify anti-G protein and anti-F protein titers in 3 lots of RI-002 and 9 lots of commercial IG [Unpublished observations]. Enhanced levels of antibody to F protein and G protein (1.5-fold or greater compared to commercial IVIG lots) were observed in RI-002 lots compared to commercial IG, suggesting that selection of donors based on high anti-RSV titers in microneutralization assays enhances anti-RSV antibodies for multiple RSV surface proteins ( Table 1) .",

Although the donor pool for RI-002 is only screened for high anti-RSV antibody titers, enriching for RSV antibodies may be correlated with increases in antibody titers to other respiratory pathogens. Orange et al. performed ELISA to evaluate virus-specific IgG titers for 9 respiratory viruses in RI-002 produced from 3 plasma pools and 10 commercially available IVIG lots representing 7 brands (Table 2 ) [11] . Respiratory viruses tested include influenza A and B, RSV, parainfluenza virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3, hMPV, and coronavirus 229E and OC43. Aggregate mean titers across all viruses for RI-002 were 1.5-fold higher than those observed in commercial IG. The difference in titers for all viruses excluding hMPV achieved statistical significance with geometric mean ratios of RI-002/commercial IVIG ranging from 1.3 to 1.9. Titers to respiratory viruses were consistent across RI-002 lots for all viruses tested but varied widely among IVIG products. A direct correlation was observed between RSV titers and titers to the other tested respiratory viruses with Pearson linear correlation coefficients ranging 0.29-0.67 log 2 scale (p < 0.05). This positive correlation suggests that elevated titers to respiratory viruses may be a consistent feature of each lot of RI-002. The protective efficacy of these elevated titers against respiratory pathogens other than RSV remains to be determined. While there is no data to support a hypothesis that underlies the enhanced antibody titers to other non-RSV viruses, there are a number of possibilities to consider. It is possible that the donors who have elevated titers to RSV may have been living in an area or workplace where they were exposed over long periods of time to many other respiratory viruses and thus have elevated titers to multiple respiratory viruses. It may also be possible that those individuals with high-titer neutralizing antibody to RSV have an immune response gene that encodes for elevated antibody responses to respiratory viruses where immune response is regulated by a common histocompatibility locus.",

RSV was undetectable in the lungs of animals that had received RI-002 at all doses and in 4/5 animals that received RespiGam. Virus was undetectable in nasal tissue of all animals receiving RI-002 1000 mg/kg, below quantifiable levels in all animals at the other doses, and detectable in 2/5 animals receiving RespiGam. Anti-RSV microneutralization assays established that sera from all groups reached neutralizing titers that would be considered protective in humans (10log 2 ) through Day 4 [50] , Unpublished observations. This experiment established the efficacy of RI-002 in the cotton rat model and showed that the higher dose of 1000 mg/kg is required to sterilize the nasal tissue of animals challenged with RSV as compared to lower doses required for sterilization of pulmonary tissue. Further, a dose-response relationship was apparent for both nasal infection and neutralizing titers in S. hispidus sera.",

Following intranasal infection with RSV A-Long Strain (10 5 pfu/100g body weight), 10 animals in each group were treated with 3 doses (Days 1, 4, and 7 ) of either saline, RI-002 1500 mg/kg for all doses, or RI-002 1500 mg/kg followed by 750 mg/kg for subsequent doses. Control animals were also infected and received a single dose of either saline, RI-002 1500 mg/kg, or RI-002 750 mg/kg. Cyclophosphamide treated animals were euthanized on Day 10 and untreated animals were euthanized on Day 4. RI-002 was effective in reducing RSV viral titer by about 2-3 logs compared to saline in both the lungs and nasal tissue of treated normal and immunosuppressed animals, with a greater reduction in viral titer observed in the cyclophosphamide treated animals that received the higher dose. RSV gene expression measured by qPCR confirmed systemic dissemination of RSV in lung, liver, and kidney as well as undetectable RSV RNA in lungs and diminished RNA levels in liver and kidney following treatment with RI-002. In the same study, pulmonary histopathology of immunosuppressed cotton rats treated with high-dose RI-002 was approximately equivalent to that observed in normal uninfected rats unlike the extensive inflammatory infiltration observed in lungs of saline-treated animals ( Figure 1 ). RSV neutralizing titers were achieved with all RI-002 dose regimens that would be considered protective in humans. An equivalent prophylaxis study, in which immunosuppressed cotton rats were treated with RI-002 1500 mg/kg or 750 mg/kg 24 h prior to RSV challenge, showed a 3-4 log 10 reduction in RSV viral titers from lung homogenates at both doses demonstrating that a single dose of RI-002 prior to exposure is sufficient to protect cotton rats from infection.

Since a polyclonal antibody contains thousands of antibodies of different antigenic specificities, the concentration of each specificity can never be as high as that of a monoclonal which is of a single specificity. For this reason, higher doses of a polyclonal antibody would have to be administered compared to a monoclonal antibody to achieve comparable final concentrations of a given specificity. Palivizumab 15 mg/kg reduced wild-type RSV/A Tracy lung titers by greater than 2 logs but this decrease was not observed with the palivizumab-resistant strain. RI-002 1500 mg/kg reduced lung titers by greater than 2 logs in both wild-type and palivizumab-resistant strains compared to palivizumab (p \u2264 0.00001). An independently validated microneutralization assay established that mean RSV serum neutralizing titers from S. hispidus were increased by 1.5-1.9 log 2 following prophylaxis with RI-002 versus palivizumab. These results were confirmed by a third laboratory that found an approximate 2 log reduction in viral load following prophylaxis with RI-002 1000 mg/kg and elimination of detectable virus with RI-002 1500 mg/kg. In the same study, virus was also eliminated from lung tissue by palivizumab 15 mg/kg ( Figure 2 ). Reduction of RSV/A Long strain viral titer in the nasal tissue of normal cotton rats was also observed with both RI-002 doses and palivizumab at 15 mg/ kg, with the greatest decrease achieved with RI-002 at 1500 mg/kg [38] .",

RespiGam, the only previous hyperimmune globulin product enriched for anti-RSV activity, is no longer marketed for several reasons including the approval of the monoclonal anti-RSV antibody palivizumab. Although it demonstrated efficacy in preventing RSV infection, it had a number of limitations on administration and was not indicated as a sole therapy for immune supplementation in the PIDD population. Although palivizumab is a current commercially available therapeutic option for patients that require prophylaxis against RSV, a monoclonal antibody, cannot provide immune reconstitution in the PIDD population-like polyclonal products, nor does it have the potential to provide protection against other respiratory viruses or palivizumab-resistant strains of RSV which are becoming more prevalent. In addition, polyclonal antibodies have the advantage of providing anti-inflammatory activity that is triggered by RSV while the monoclonal does not [56] . RI-001 and RI-002 were developed by ADMA Biologics to fill the void left by the market withdrawal of RespiGam. RI-001 was well tolerated in a phase II trial of immunocompromised patients with RSV URTI and achieved the primary efficacy end point, with a mean fold change in circulating RSV neutralized titer \u2265fourfold in 6/7 (86%) patients in the high-dose arm [35] . An open-label, compassionate use treatment study was conducted in 15 patients with RSV LRTI at high risk of mortality with 73.3% survival [35] . Although no conclusions can be drawn due to limits in sample size, several encouraging trends toward improved clinical outcomes were observed. Factors associated with survival included age, early intervention, absence of need for ventilator support (10/10 patients), fewer average days from onset of respiratory symptoms to first treatment with RI-001, and shorter time from positive RSV test to first treatment with RI-001. RI-001 was also associated with significant increases in RSV serum neutralizing antibody titer in a subset of 7 immunocompromised adults with favorable clinical outcomes that were enrolled in the compassionate use study [35] . Although promising, from an efficacy and safety perspective, RI-001 was subject to the same limitations as RespiGam and did not meet FDA requirements for supplementation in the PIDD population [9] .",

Further, this enrichment is not limited to RSV but also yields consistently higher (1.5-fold higher aggregate mean) neutralizing titers against a host of other respiratory pathogens including influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3, hMPV, and coronavirus 229E and OC43 [11] . Although prophylactic efficacy in human populations against these additional pathogens has yet to be established, it is probable that RI-002 may impact the incidence of respiratory infections of any cause within immunocompromised populations with a similar trend to that observed in the RespiGam PREVENT study [26] . Serum from S. hispidus RI-002-treated animals was tested against 10 strains of influenza by HAI inhibition assays and was considered protective against 4 prevalent circulating strains, with titers ranging from 1:160 to 1:640 [51] . Similar protection was not observed for noncirculating influenza strains, suggesting that the donor selection process used to manufacture RI-002 only enriches humoral antibodies against common respiratory pathogens when donors have been exposed. S. hispidus challenged with influenza/A California 07/2009 (H1N1) one day following prophylactic administration of RI-002 1500 mg/kg had significantly improved lung histology, reduced viral mRNA in pulmonary tissue, and reduced chemotactic chemokine (CXCL10 and RANTES) mRNA compared to saline-treated animals suggesting that the observed titers may be adequate to provide improved protection against circulating influenza strains [49] .",

Data collected in the S. hispidus model for multiple agents has proven its reliability in predicting the efficacy of new therapeutic agents against RSV and, importantly, this model can be extended to young, elderly, and immunosuppressed populations. RI-002 achieved protective titers in S. hispidus, protected animals from infection, and was successful in maintaining normal lung histology and in eliminating infection in treated animals [11, 33, 34, 50] . These findings extended to both immunocompromised animals and animals infected with palivizumab-resistant RSV [48, [50] [51] [52] . Data collected in S. hispidus are similar to the trends observed in the phase II and compassionate use study of RI-001, which provided equivalent anti-RSV neutralizing titers compared to RI-002. The neutralizing titers that were reached in the animal model were on average twofold higher than that achieved with the clinical dosing regimen of palivizumab. Although limited in size, these studies demonstrate that RI-002 achieves high RSV neutralizing antibody titers that can be considered protective in humans and could result in improved outcomes in RSV-infected patients when treatment begins soon after the onset of symptoms.",

In addition to reduction in the incidence of serious bacterial infection and RSV, neutralizing antibody titers against other respiratory pathogens are also elevated [11] . In S. hispidus, RI-002 achieved protective titers against four strains of commonly circulating influenza, improved lung histology postinfection, reduced or eliminated influenza viral mRNA, and suppressed chemotactic signaling [49, 50] . Taken together, these data suggest that a comparable effect is possible in humans although this remains to be determined. The process of enriching for anti-RSV antibodies within the donor pool is strongly correlated with increased antibody titers against other respiratory viruses and this finding is reproducible in all lots tested [10] . The impact of increased humoral protection against a range of commonly circulating respiratory viruses that pose a risk to PIDD patient is not yet known, although consistent supplementation with IG against respiratory illness is likely to be of clinical benefit based on previous data generated by the PREVENT study group.",

While commonly used prophylactic agents provide protection against a limited spectrum of specific pathogens, the potential for broad-spectrum protection against respiratory viruses that have previously required additional prophylactic agents or for which no protective agents are available will be an invaluable to physicians seeking to optimize protection of these patients with enhanced passive immunity to the range of commonly encountered pathogenic viruses. In addition to these patients, it could be used in patients who have been hospitalized with severe RSV respiratory infections who have not responded to conventional therapy. The observed correlation between selection for donors with high-titer RSV neutralizing antibodies and elevated antibody titers against commonly circulating viruses may pave the way for additional IG products with expanded coverage.",

An open-label compassionate use study was also conducted that suggested that RI-001 may provide a survival benefit to subjects, particularly when treatment is initiated early. \u2022 RI-002 is currently under development and is manufactured using the pooled plasma of more than 1000 donors that had the highest titers of anti-RSV neutralizing antibodies. In comparison to RI-001, RI-002 is standardized with equivalent anti-RSV titers using a proprietary standard. RI-002 meets FDA immunoglobulin supplementation requirements for minimum titers of antibodies to diphtheria toxoid and measles and polio viruses in immunocompromised populations including PIDD patients. \u2022 The manufacturing process for RI-002 selects for higher titers of anti-RSV antibodies against multiple RSV antigens compared to commercially available IG products. Further, this selection also yields consistently higher (1.5-fold higher aggregate mean) neutralizing antibody titers against other respiratory pathogens. \u2022 Evidence from S. hispidus preclinical testing demonstrates that RI-002 is effective for RSV treatment and prophylaxis in both normal and immunocompromised hosts and also shows some efficacy against commonly circulating strains of influenza. Further, RI-002 is protective against palivizumab-resistant RSV, probably because RI-002 contains antibodies targeting multiple RSV surface proteins. \u2022 RI-002 was well tolerated in a Phase III clinical trial and met the primary efficacy endpoint of <1 serious bacterial infection per person year, with no serious bacterial infections documented over 56 person-years.",
