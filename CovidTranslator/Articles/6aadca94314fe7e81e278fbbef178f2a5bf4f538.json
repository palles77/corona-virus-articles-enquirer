The majority of these mistakes are avoidable [2]. Methods We audited the daily infusion charts of all patients in three separate spot checks, over 1 week. We assessed all aspects of prescriptions that make them legal and valid, in accordance with national guidance [3]. New procedures were introduced, which included a standardised prescription sticker, with common, preprinted, infusion prescriptions on (noradrenaline, propofol, and so forth), and education on using the new prescription stickers.

On each occasion the Limpet photographed the 'thief' and recorded the date and time of access. Therefore, in the event of a real theft it would be possible to quickly and easily indentify the culprit. Conclusion When CDs are missing it can be extremely stressful for the staff involved. Those who have access to CDs may feel unfairly scrutinised and the potential for false accusation exists. Investigating the theft of CDs is costly and usually involves pharmacists, managers and the police. Until the issue is resolved, potential suspects are usually suspended from work, leading to disruptions in patient care. The utility of the Limpet in modifying staff behaviour by reducing the number of occasions and the duration of time that open drug cupboards are left unattended, has previously been demonstrated [1]. By providing the facility to determine exactly who accessed each CD cupboard at which time, this initial study has shown the benefi ts of the Limpet as a tool for detecting theft. Therefore the installation of the Limpet mitigates the diffi culties of investigating CD theft and is likely to prove an eff ective deterrent. Reference 1.

This creates both the hazard of medication errors and potentially exposes patients to opioid intoxicated healthcare workers. As most critical care staff have access to CDs, when drugs are found to be missing it can be diffi cult to identify the perpetrators. Therefore the implementation of a deterrent which also improves the methods of detection is warranted. Methods The Limpet, a device which incorporates a proximity sensor and a camera unit, was installed within the CD cupboard of the critical care unit. Whenever the cupboard was accessed the date and time were recorded and a photograph was taken to identify the staff member. Mock thefts were subsequently undertaken by a designated staff member at random times. This allowed testing of the product to determine the number of times the 'thief' was correctly identifi ed.",

            "text": "Introduction The purpose of this study was to assess our practice in identifying and managing inadvertent hypothermia and whether this could be improved by education and introduction of a protocol. Hypothermia is associated with multiple physiological abnormalities including reduced myocardial contractility, peripheral vasoconstriction, increased infection risk and impaired coagulation [1] . Inadvertent hypothermia may therefore be an avoidable risk factor in the critically ill. The UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence has issued guidance for avoidance of inadvertent hypothermia (temperature <36\u00b0C) during the perioperative period. We audited our practice against three standards from these guidelines: all patients should have at least 4-hourly temperature observations; no patient should become inadvertently hypothermic; and all inadvertently hypothermic patients should be rewarmed. Methods Data were collected prospectively. Body temperature was recorded routinely by nursing staff using a tympanic thermometer. We noted any occasion where the body temperature dropped below 36\u00b0C along with any associated interventions -such as the use of additional bed sheets or a forced air warming device. After the fi rst audit period a simple education programme was delivered. We also introduced a departmental protocol for the prevention and management of inadvertent hypothermia. Six months later we re-audited our practice. Results Data were collected from 130 patients (2,931 patient-hours) in the fi rst audit period and from 87 patients (2,070 patient-hours) in the second audit period. In the fi rst period 29% of patients had at least 4-hourly temperature measurements compared with 40% in the second period (P <0.01). The average number of overdue temperature observations per day was 1.4 in the fi rst period and 0.9 in the second (P <0.01). Twenty-four per cent of patients became hypothermic in the fi rst period compared with 22% in the second (P = 0.07); however, the time these patients remained hypothermic reduced from an average of 7.9 hours to 6.1 hours (P <0.01). An intervention was made and documented in 15% of cases in the fi rst period and 46% in the second (P <0.001). Conclusion We saw some improvement following an education programme and introduction of a clinical protocol although there remains room for further improvement. Reference Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the leading cause of death amongst hospital-acquired infections and is also linked to an increased length of stay and cost of care. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement ventilator bundle is comprised of a series of interventions, which, when implemented together, have been shown to decrease the incidence of VAP. The aim of this study was to determine the compliance of the bundle and if <95% [1] devise strategies to improve compliance. Methods A retrospective review of the compliance of an existing VAP bundle was conducted for all adult patients ventilated in the ICU of a large district general hospital in 2011. The bundle comprised four elements: head up 30\u00b0, peptic ulcer prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and sedation hold. The bundle was considered compliant if all four were performed. The fi ndings of the audit were presented to the department and, through subsequent discussions, barriers to noncompliance were identifi ed. Following a period of education, a revised and updated bundle was implemented. A repeat audit covering 3 months was subsequently conducted. Results Pre-intervention, overall compliance of the bundle stood at 32% and subsequently increased to 63% post intervention (P <0.05). Compliance at the level of individual elements varied: head up 30\u00b0, 94%; ulcer prophylaxis, 91%; DVT prophylaxis, 85%; sedation hold, 37%. Post intervention, a statistically signifi cant increase in compliance with regard to sedation hold was observed; 72% (P <0.05). The other individual elements did not show a statistical change. However, the new elements that were introduced demonstrated high levels of compliance; cuff pressure 20 to 30 cm H 2 O 83% and oral hygiene with chlorhexidine 90%. Conclusion Post intervention, a statistically signifi cant improvement in overall bundle compliance was found. Thereby highlighting that through engaging all members of the multidisciplinary team in identifying barriers to noncompliance and delivering education, it is possible to improve compliance. While total compliance was suboptimal as the target was 95%, the bundle redesign has given a tool that records compliance with greater clarity due to the presence of clearly defi ned exclusion criteria. It has also been a signifi cant step in the right direction to improving the reliability of care delivered to patient and reinforces the concept that quality improvement is a continuous cycle. Reference Introduction The demand for intensive care has reached new heights, where medical advancement and aging populations have increased the proportion of patients with multi comorbidities. Ideally, bed occupancy on the ICU should be around 70% whereas beyond 80% has been associated with increased mortality. William Harvey Hospital is a district general hospital with nine ICU beds where the ICNARC national database suggested a consistently high occupancy. The purpose of this study was to assess bed occupancy and its impact on service delivery. Methods Data were collected between 2005 and 2013 to analyse trends in ICU bed occupancy, overnight discharges, surgical cancellations, and nonclinical transfers. Data were gathered from April 2012 to March 2013 using quality indicators (Intensive Care Society): readmissions; premature discharges; discharges at night; cancelled planned surgery; and nonclinical transfers. Regression analysis was conducted to assess: correlation between mortality and eff ects of excess occupancy; and causality of increasing demand for ICU beds. Results Bed occupancy remained high between 2005 and 2013 with a 15% increase. This was associated with increased overnight discharges (29%), surgical cancellations (90%), and nonclinical transfers (88%). Between 2012 and 2013, the calculated demand for beds was 174. There were 1.8 ICU to 100 hospital beds and 4.5 ICU beds per 100,000 population, which dropped signifi cantly when including regional specialty services. A persistent gap between ICU bed supply and demand was associated with increased unfavourable outcomes in all quality indicators. Conclusion A steady increase in occupancy over the last 8 years was due to multiple factors, including an increase in clinical services such as in the coronary care centre, head and neck unit, and trauma centre. Presentation of our results to managerial level facilitated increased bed capacity by 22%. References Introduction Physicians have an intense and irregular workday life. Thus, they need to use their time for continuing education in the most effi cient way. This presents a major challenge to suppliers of continuing study programs. Our online master program Physico-Technical Medicine (PTM) addresses working physicians who want to acquire knowledge in the fi elds of biomedical engineering and medical physics [1] . We attach great importance to the special needs of our participants. Therefore, we investigated which general conditions are most important for the working physician regarding qualifying continuing education. Methods The general conditions of our continuing education program (PTM) were examined on the basis of evaluation questionnaires. Additionally, students were asked in interviews about their demands, and they could give anonymous feedback on feedback cards. Results Flexibility: students appreciated fl exibility regarding time and environment of their learning activities. This fl exibility enables the students to use even small time frames or traveling times for learning. Students can choose their preferred time and place for their learning activities. Security in planning: students have to organize their time frames for learning besides their daily work, their family life, and possibly their academic career. Especially phases of attendance should be planned and communicated as early as possible. Transparency of structure: participants ask for transparency in terms of the expected workload and expenditure of time to plan their studies and get focused. Relation to previous knowledge: learning success is supported by relating new contents to previous knowledge from the student's fi rst medical degree. Mainly clinical examples illustrate abstract topics, which also helps students to recognize the relevance of the content. Individual support: students need contact persons in terms of learning organization, technical support, and for questions regarding the course material. Conclusion We could show that an extra-occupational continuing study program for physicians should be adjusted to their special situation and therefore has to comply with particular requirements. As such we could identify fi ve main requirements which are continuously fulfi lled by the online master program PTM and regularly surveyed by evaluations. Reference Introduction A collaborative approach to patient management has been shown to improve patient outcomes. In a resource-limited NHS, critical care beds are at a premium, therefore preventing unnecessary admissions by optimising ward-based management is essential. The objective of this service quality improvement project was to improve collaboration between the critical care directorate and neurosurgical high care unit at a tertiary university teaching hospital. We proposed that the use of a simple ward round tool on collaborative rounds would facilitate systematic patient review, prompt early recognition of those critically unwell and improve patient outcomes. Methods An initial observation period of behaviours and practice on the neurosurgical unit was conducted with qualitative and quantitative data collection. Following analysis of these outcome measures a simple ward round tool was constructed, with the mnemonic 'DON'T FORGET' , and we devised a programme for collaborative ward rounds to take place three times per week over a 1-month period. During this Introduction Daily blood tests are an essential diagnostic tool and routine practice in the management of ICU patients, but are associated with cost and a risk of anaemia. There is no evidence for the frequency or breadth of blood testing but there is evidence that by rationalising blood tests, signifi cant cost saving can be made without a negative eff ect on mortality or length of ICU stay [1] . Blood tests in our ICU are requested by nurses, this is a unique practice to the ICU compared with other hospital departments. Methods We had previously carried out a survey to assess blood requesting practise in UK ICUs. This demonstrated that routine tests were, as in our ICU, nurse led and the majority of staff underestimated the costs of tests. Using the results of this survey and a literature review we developed routine blood test guidelines for our general mixed 26bed ICU/HDU. Following a period of staff education, we audited our blood requesting practice over 28 days. Results Our blood testing did not comply with our guidelines. Over the 28-day period, \u20ac12,849.96 was spent on all blood tests. According to our guidelines, \u20ac2,914.96 was spent on inappropriate tests (\u20ac37,998.63 per year) ( Table 1) . Over 40% of this cost was spent on the coagulation screen. Conclusion In our ICU, unnecessary blood tests have a signifi cant cost burden of approximately \u20ac38,000 per year. To limit unnecessary costs, consultants now lead requesting by completing a blood test pro forma on the evening ICU ward round indicating which blood tests are clinically needed the following day.

Conclusion Most family members were highly satisfi ed with ICU care their patients received. Nevertheless, our study showed that the fi elds of communication with the nurses as well as the waiting room atmosphere defi nitely need further improvement. Concerning emotional support and decision-making, the study revealed that currently used measures in our ICU still do not apply to all families and probably require a few changes. Introduction Signifi cant improvements in chemotherapy, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and general intensive care mean that more patients are now living longer and often present to the ICU at various stages of their disease [1, 2] . Encouraging patients with haematological malignancy (HM) to express their wishes and values on end of life (EoL) prior to ICU admission would ensure that their autonomy is respected. The aim of our study was to determine whether patients with HM that were admitted and died in the ICU had any form of advance care planning (ACP) documented prior to their admission. Methods Data were collected on all adult patients with HM that were admitted and died in the ICU of a tertiary haematology referral centre in London during the period of 1 year. Results Information was collected for 34 patients and their characteristics are shown in Table 1 . In 62% of the patients EoL decisions were made, and do-not-attempt-resuscitation documentation was found in 65% of the cases. Documentation on information exchange, and participation in the deliberation or the decision-making process was found in only 30% of the patients, even though more than 75% of the haematology physicians estimated the prognosis of these patients as moderate (17%) or poor (59%). In the vast majority of cases (31/34) the deaths occurred after withholding or withdrawal of treatment in ICU. Conclusion Only a small number of patients with HM that die in the ICU have documented ACP prior to admission. Since the majority of ICU patients lack personal decision-making capacity, ACP would ensure that care is consistent with patients' wishes, EoL actions are congruent with their values, the burden on family and healthcare providers is alleviated and cost is decreased.

Yet the prognostic value of proADM in general oncological patients presenting to the ED remains unclear. Herein, the objective of this study is to evaluate the prognostic potential of proADM and clinical parameters in a consecutive cohort of patients with oncological and hematological malignancies with regard to ICU admission and 30-day mortality. Methods We enrolled all consecutive patients with oncological and hematological malignancies seeking ED care at a tertiary care hospital from February 2013 to October 2013. We prospectively collected various clinical features, and measured blood parameters including proADM upon admission. To assess outcomes, data from electronic medical records -that is, ICU admission, length of stay (LOS), and postacute care location -were used and we contacted all patients 30 days after hospital admission.

Data were anonymised, coded and analysed centrally. Results A cumulative total of 399 calls were made to the critical care teams in the six hospitals. The most common reason for referral was to request a critical care review of a patient (n = 319, 79.9%). Other reasons for referral included cardiac arrest, request to transfer patients from other hospitals and requests for vascular access. The average duration spent by the critical care team reviewing patients on the wards was 57 minutes. This increased up to 67 minutes for cardiac arrest calls. Of the 319 critical care reviews, 160 (50.2%) patients were subsequently admitted to critical care. A total 118 of this 160 had EWS of 7 or above, while 42 scored less than 7 but were still deemed to require admission to critical care. Conclusion Regardless of the EWS, critical care teams are heavily involved in the management of patients outside critical care units. Fifty per cent of patients reviewed by the critical care team subsequently required admission to a critical care unit. The trigger threshold (7 and above) for referral to a critical care team currently recommended by the EWS escalation protocol is more likely to predict need for critical care admission. However, one in four patients referred below the threshold also required admission to a critical care environment. This study questions the safety of introducing such a protocol into acute hospitals. Will noncritical care staff be forced to wait until patients deteriorate further and reach the trigger threshold for referral or will the role of the critical care team expand further to look after all patients with abnormal EWS in hospital?",

Reference Introduction Based on expert opinion and case note review, the UK National Confi dential Enquiry into Peri-operative Outcome has recommended provision of perioperative level 2 and 3 care to support major surgery in older people, and particularly those with comorbidity [1] . We wished to identify whether we could predict if the need was uniform and whether any factors could predict the degree of organ supports needed. Methods A retrospective note review of all patients admitted to a level 2 critical care unit in the 12-month period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 undergoing revision hip surgery either as a two-stage or single-stage process. Surgery was undertaken at a national referral unit and chosen to represent an appropriate group of older, comorbid patients. Predefi ned preoperative and perioperative data were collected from chart review, along with postoperative physiological data whilst the patient was in critical care. This included frailty, comorbidities, operative blood loss, anaesthetic technique and level and duration or organ supports including the need for additional medical review whilst on the unit. Frailty was assessed preoperatively using the Rockwood assessment tool by trained staff [2] . Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011 and Stata/IC 11.2 for Mac. Results A total of 182 patients with a mean age of 69.8 years (range 29 to 92) were identifi ed. Frail patients were signifi cantly more likely to need additional medical input in the postoperative period whilst on critical care ( Figure 1 , P = 0.002) but this was not signifi cantly linked to need for vasopressors, evidence of sepsis or choice of anaesthetic technique. Conclusion In complex revision orthopaedic surgery, the need for postoperative level 2/3 support cannot be predicted from any preoperative or intraoperative factors but patient frailty does indicate the need for medical input in the postoperative period.

Conclusion Our study gives qualitative evidence that survivors of critical illness have reduced muscle strength, physical functioning and HRQL after hospital discharge. Also, we have shown muscle weakness is predictive of overall physical functioning, which in turn impacted HRQL and mental health. No ICU risk factors were identifi ed that predicted defi cits in muscle strength or physical functioning. Introduction The aim of this study was to determine an appropriate risk model to identify patients at high risk of prolonged ICU stay and to aid patient consent prior to cardiac surgery. Methods Data were prospectively collected on 5,440 consecutive cardiac surgery cases between April 2009 and March 2012. The primary outcome measure was the combined outcome of prolonged ICU stay (length of stay greater than 20 days) and/or in-hospital mortality. Logistic regression was performed to assess the predictability of logistic EuroSCORE against the primary outcome. Low-risk, mediumrisk and high-risk groups were identifi ed and subsequent risk of 1-year mortality assessed. Survival status was determined at 1 year. Results A total of 192 (3.5%) patients had a prolonged ICU stay and 187 (3.4%) in-hospital deaths occurred, resulting in a combined primary outcome of 349 (6.4%). At 1 year, 371 (6.8%) deaths occurred. The risk of death in-hospital and at 1 year was signifi cantly higher in patients with prolonged ICU stay (in-hospital mortality, 15.6% vs. 3.0%; P <0.001/1 year, 27.6% vs. 6.1%; P <0.001). The mean logistic EuroSCORE for all patients was 10.9. Patients with prolonged ICU stay had a signifi cantly higher logistic EuroSCORE (20.3 vs. 10.6; P <0.001).",

Although in-hospital mortality rates have fallen (12 to 13% in 1998 to 2.5% 2013), complication rates remain high [1] with anastomotic failure and respiratory failure common postoperatively [2] . The aim of this retrospective review was to examine the outcomes in patients who underwent oesophagectomies in our unit between January 2010 and October 2012. Methods We examined demographic data, survival (30 day and 1 year) and length of ICU and hospital stay. Case notes were reviewed to identify postoperative complications including anastomotic breakdown, reintubation and respiratory failure. Data were analysed to examine the relationship between the use of postoperative noninvasive ventilation and intraoperative fl uid volume and the incidence of postoperative complications. Results Seventy-two patients were identifi ed as having undergone an oesophagectomy between January 2010 and October 2012. Median age was 65 and 82% were male. One patient died within 30 days (1.39%) Critical Care 2014, Volume 18 Suppl 1 http://ccforum.com/supplements/18/S1 S21 and nine patients had died by 1 year (12.5%). The median length of ICU and hospital stay was 4 days and 14 days respectively. Six patients had an anastomotic leak (of which two were chyle leaks). Use of noninvasive ventilation (in 23.1% of patients) was not associated with an anastomotic leak (chi-square P = 0.53), nor was the amount of fl uid given intraoperatively (Mann-Whitney U P = 0.410). Six patients had to be reintubated and this was associated with a signifi cantly increased length of both ICU and hospital stay (Mann-Whitney U P = 0.01 and 0.03 respectively). Lower P/F ratios were also associated with a signifi cant increase in length of both ICU and hospital stay (P = 0.007 and 0.043). Conclusion The overall mortality and morbidity rate was comparable with that seen nationally. Our data suggest that the use of non-invasive ventilation was not associated with anastomotic breakdown. A lower P/F ratio in the postoperative period was associated with prolonged ICU and hospital stay. ",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate accuracy of SAPS II scoring by means of a nationwide survey. Methods Twenty clinical scenarios, covering a broad range of illness severity, were randomly assigned to a convenience sample of clinicians or nurses of Swiss adult ICUs. They were asked to assign a SAPS II score (including details for each item of the score) for one scenario. Results were compared with a reference, as defi ned by fi ve experienced researchers using a Delphi method, and cross-matched with data related to training and quality control for scoring, information on daily practice of scoring, and structural and organizational properties of each participating ICU. Results Sixty-three (81%) of 78 adult ICUs participated in this survey. A perfect match with each single reference item was found in 27 (7.8%) of 345 scorings. The participants' mean SAPS II scoring was 42.6 \u00b1 23.4, with a bias of +5.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 9.5) as compared with the reference score. There was no evidence of variation of the bias according to case severity, number of beds in the unit, number of residents during workshifts, linguistic area, profession (physician vs. nurse), experience, initial SAPS II training, and presence of a quality control system. The items with highest scoring accuracy were bilirubin, temperature and chronic disease (93%, 93% and 91% respectively), whereas the lowest agreement was found for urinary output and for the Glasgow Coma Scale (63% and 64%). Conclusion This nationwide survey suggests a wide variability of SAPS II scoring results. On average, SAPS II was overestimated by more than 10%, irrespective of the profession or experience of the scorer or the structural characteristics of the ICUs. At least one person per unit involved in the scoring should be trained by the national society and should be responsible for the scoring quality. Introduction Early Warning Scores (EWS) are used in UK hospitals to identify patients who are acutely unwell or needing urgent review. The National EWS (NEWS) [1] was implemented in our institution and led to a noticeable increase in the numbers of patients being triggered for escalation of medical care, although clinically this was thought unwarranted. This led to a potentially dangerous lack of faith in the NEWS by clinical staff . We assessed whether it was safe to move to VitalPAC\u2122 EWS (ViEWS), a commercially available electronic EWS [2] . Methods All patients scored as 'high risk' by NEWS (with a score of 6 or more) in a snapshot audit of patients in our 500-bed acute district general hospital were identifi ed and reviewed clinically. All of these patients were then recategorised using ViEWS. The clinical safety of this recategorisation was then assessed. Results Forty-six patients were identifi ed in our hospital at the time of the snapshot as being high risk according to NEWS. After recategorising this cohort of patients using ViEWS, 36 were classifi ed as high risk (in this instance meaning a score of 5 or more). Subjectively the authors did not have any clinical concerns created by moving 10 patients out of the high-risk classifi cation. Conclusion ViEWS is more specifi c without being less sensitive. We have replaced NEWS with ViEWS and feel that this is clinically safe.",

Conclusion In our two-phase study, we have developed and validated a prognostic model that can be used to assist in the management of blunt chest wall trauma patients. The fi nal risk score provides the clinician with the probability of the development of complications for each individual patient. Introduction Crush syndrome is often encountered in natural disasters. It is a critical condition leading to multiple organ failure. However, the mechanisms by which the local traumatic injuries aff ect distant organs remain unknown. We paid attention to bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) as therapeutic strategy against crush injury. Transplantation of BMMNCs can elicit protection and regeneration against damaged organs through their paracrine properties and its clinical application has been realized to treat ischemia reperfusion-related various diseases. We have previously reported that multiple organ damage based on systemic infl ammatory response is induced in crush injury and the pathogenesis is largely dependent on massive ischemia-reperfusion. We investigated whether BMMNCs could suppress systemic infl ammation and improve mortality in a rat model of crush injury. Methods To develop crush syndrome, both hind limbs of rats were compressed for 6 hours under weights (3.0 kg each). Rats in the treated group were intravenously administrated BMMNCs (1\u00d710 7 cells in 1 ml phosphate-buff ered saline (PBS)) immediately after weight removal (BMMNC group) and PBS alone was administered in the control group (CR group). The sham group underwent the same procedure without compression of hind limbs (SH group). The rats were observed over 7 days after the injury to evaluate survival. To estimate antiinfl ammatory eff ects of BMMNCs, sera were collected 3 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours after the injury. The levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) were measured by ELISA and statistically analyzed.",

The level of TNF\u03b1 decreased signifi cantly in the BMMNC group compared with that in the CR group 24 hours after the compression release (P <0.05). These fi ndings suggest that transplantation of BMMNCs has an ability to evade the devastating condition following crush injury by suppressing systemic infl ammation. Conclusion The administration of BMMNCs reduced production of infl ammatory cytokines and improved survival rate in a rat model of crush injury. Cell therapy using BMMNCs might become a novel therapy against crush injury.",

A total of 20.1% (n = 292) were classifi ed as high treatment priority, 5.4% (n = 79) were admitted to the ICU and 4.4% (n = 64) died within 30 days. The initial MTS showed a good prognostic accuracy to predict treatment priority (AUC 0.75) and ICU admission (AUC 0.76), but not for mortality prediction (AUC 0.58). Initial ProADM levels were independent predictors for all three outcomes and signifi cantly improved the MTS score to AUCs of 0.78 for treatment priority, 0.80 for ICU admission and 0.84 for mortality. Conclusion Within this large cohort of consecutive unselected medical patients seeking ED care, the MTS instrument in combination with a prognostic biomarker (ProADM) allowed accurate initial risk assessment in regard to treatment priority, ICU admission and mortality. A combined score has the potential to signifi cantly improve initial risk assessment in patients, which may translate into faster and more targeted care and better clinical patient outcomes.",

To our knowledge no studies have been published on incidence of admissions to critical care in England after overdose. Our aim was to investigate the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients admitted to critical care after intentional self-poisoning to establish patterns in our community. Methods We performed a retrospective data collection using our critical care database 'Metavision' to select all patients admitted with a diagnosis of 'overdose' . Records were scrutinised to collect information on patient demographics, clinical features and medical management. Results Thirty-eight patients (male:female ratio 1:1.53) were admitted to critical care over a 1-year period (September 2011 to 2012). This represented 2.45% of the total admissions to critical care during the same period. The sample had a signifi cantly younger median age (45 years) than the standard patient population in critical care (68 years) during the same period (P <0.0001). Despite the young age and paucity of comorbidities, there was no diff erence in length of stay between overdose patients (2.0 days) and all other patients on critical care (1.58 days, P = 0.3). The median number of agents ingested was three Critical Care 2014, Volume 18 Suppl 1 http://ccforum.com/supplements/18/S1 S25 (1 to 7) with 84.2% ingesting \u22652 agents. Hypnotics and antidepressants made up 45% of the agents ingested. A total 92.1% of the sample was admitted out-of-hours or at weekends. Fifty per cent had a past history of overdose, 25% had a history of alcohol misuse. A total of 79% of patients were referred to critical care due to a low conscious level but only 50% required IPPV and 20% received vasopressors/inotropes. The mortality rate was 2.6%, with one further death 6 months after discharge due to alcoholic liver disease. Estimated fi nancial cost was \u00a380,555 or \u00a32,119 per patient (57 level 3 bed-days, 35 level 2 bed-days). Conclusion Intentional self-poisoning mortality rates are low in spite of the number of patients admitted. Despite the young age of patients and lack of comorbidities, their length of stay is similar to the average length of stay for all patients admitted to the unit, representing a signifi cant fi nancial cost. Self-poisoning requiring critical care support is more common out-of-hours when less senior expertise is available. Education of junior doctors into management of overdose is therefore vital to ensure the early identifi cation and appropriate treatment of these patients. Introduction A number of studies have demonstrated the signifi cant and increasing morbidity and mortality associated with alcohol-related disease in the UK, and the corresponding impact this has on critical care services [1] . This study was designed to similarly evaluate the current burden of alcohol-related disease on admission rates to a regional ICU, but also to calculate the fi nancial costs of such admissions. Methods Data-entry fi elds derived from recommendations in a public heath publication [2] were introduced to the local electronic records system to enable prospective data collection for all admissions that were either wholly or partially attributable to alcohol consumption. Using locally defi ned values for the cost per day of an admission to the ICU, depending on the maximum level of organ support required during the admission, it was possible to calculate the total expense incurred by the unit for each alcohol-related admission.",

The treatment had a rapid eff ect on gene expression, 339 and 627 genes were diff erentially expressed at S2 and S3 respectively. However, the number of these genes decreased drastically at S4 (only 24 genes signifi cant). The genes identifi ed at S2 were mostly related to the decrease of growth, development and quantity of leukocytes but these biological processes were not found signifi cant at S3, indicating that the action of glucocorticoid in the response to burn injury is short lived and time dependent.

Reference Introduction The Managed Clinical Network for Care of Burns in Scotland (COBIS) was launched in April 2007. Primary aims included establishing and maintaining a registry of complex burn injury in Scotland and setting mechanisms to regularly audit outcome of burn treatment against nationally agreed standards of care. On behalf of COBIS, we present 3-year incidence and mortality data of Scottish patients admitted with a complex burn injury in this abstract. Methods From January 2010 onwards, data were prospectively collected for all patients in Scotland with complex burn injury admitted to Scottish burns units. Data collection was initially on a paper pro forma, but subsequently evolved into a web-based audit data capture system to securely link hospital sites involved in the delivery of care of complex burns. Data collected included extent and mechanism of burn, presence of airway burn or smoke inhalational injury, comorbidities, complications, length of stay, interventions and mortality. Quality, completeness and consistency of data collection are audited with feedback to the individual units.",

The amount of times a U&E or FBC were requested was largely unchanged, but the amount of times a LFT, bone profi le, magnesium and clotting screen were ordered reduced by approximately 50%.

In the literature, the blood loss in burn surgery is estimated to be at least 123 \u00b1 106 ml per percentage body surface area excised [1] . Recently we developed a novel hemostatic technique using a silicone gel dressing (SI-AID\u00ae; ALCARE Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) to stop intraoperative bleeding. Briefl y, soon after tangential excision with the Humby knife, the wounds were sprayed with thrombin and with 1:100,000 adrenalin solution and wrapped tightly with SI-AID\u00ae for a full 10 minutes. Burn wounds on limbs were tangentially excised under tourniquet control and wrapped with SI-AID\u00ae before defl ation of the tourniquet. After defl ation of the tourniquets, we waited for a full 10 minutes. When the SI-AID\u00ae was removed, any major bleeders were cauterized, and the grafts were applied after rinsing the wounds with warm saline. Methods This is a prospective observational study. From 1 January to 31 October 2013 we collected preoperative and 24-hour postoperative hemoglobin levels from the patients who underwent tangential excision for burn injury, and calculated blood loss in the perioperative period. The data for amounts of blood transfusion, excised area, and harvest area were also collected. Introduction Massive bleeding remains a leading cause of potentially preventable death after cardiovascular surgery [1] . Conventional coagulation tests (CCT) fail to characterize the multiple hemostatic abnormalities observed in surgical patients and are further limited by their slow results and poor correlation with transfusion requirements.",

The primary complication of any available anticoagulant therapy is the risk of bleeding. Rapid reversal of anticoagulation may be necessary in patients requiring emergency treatment due to uncontrolled bleeding. Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) are frequently used to reverse the eff ect of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin and have also been suggested to be potentially eff ective in reversing the eff ects of the new oral anticoagulants. The present study was therefore designed to determine whether the four-factor PCC Beriplex\u00ae can eff ectively reverse bleeding and normalize coagulation following edoxaban administration in a rabbit kidney injury model. Methods Rabbits were treated with a high intravenous bolus dose of edoxaban (1,200 \u03bcg/kg) followed by the administration of Beriplex\u00ae (25 to 75 IU/kg). Bleeding was assessed based on the time to hemostasis and the total blood loss after induction of a standardized kidney injury. In parallel, the following biomarkers of hemostasis were determined: factor Xa inhibition, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), whole blood clotting time (WBCT), and thrombin generation (TGA).",

Both parameters achieved statistical signifi cance compared with placebo at the Beriplex\u00ae dose of 50 IU/kg under fully blinded study conditions. The biomarkers correlating best with Beriplex\u00ae-mediated edoxaban anticoagulation reversal included PT, WBCT and endogenous thrombin potential.

Conclusion Bivalirudin is a valuable option for anticoagulation in patients with VAD, and can be easily monitored with aPTT. The use of a bivalirudin-based anticoagulation strategy in the early postoperative period may overcome many limitations of heparin, and above all the risk of HIT which is higher in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

The aim of this study was to defi ne which is the best transfusion strategy in septic shock patients regarding 28-day mortality and clinical outcomes: restrictive or liberal. Methods The Transfusion Requirements After Cardiac Surgery (TRACS) study is a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical noninferiority trial conducted between February 2009 and February 2010 in an ICU at a university hospital cardiac surgery referral center in Brazil. Consecutive adult patients (n = 502) who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were eligible; analysis was by intention to treat. This is a randomized controlled parallel-group trial, which included 300 patients admitted to a cancer ICU with diagnosis of septic shock. Patients were randomly assigned to a liberal strategy of blood transfusion (to maintain hemoglobin >9 g/dl) or to a restrictive strategy (hemoglobin >7 g/dl). Mortality in 28 days was the main outcome. Secondary outcomes were clinical complications days free of organ dysfunction, ICU and hospital length of stay, adverse eff ects of transfusion and 60-day mortality. Results A total of 136 patients were included in the fi rst part of the trial. Mean age was 62 \u00b1 14 years, SAPS 3 at admission was 65 \u00b1 15 and all patients had the diagnosis of solid neoplasm. Sixty-three patients (46.3%) were included in the liberal strategy and 73 patients (53.7%) in the restrictive strategy.

She had an acute onset of fever, cough, muscle pain and progressive dyspnea leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The test for infl uenza A H1N1 was positive. She was recovering, but on day 12 of admission, after 1 hour of platelet transfusion, she started with intensive tachycardia, dyspnea and hypoxemia. Her mechanical ventilation parameters increased dramatically. She was in plan for extubation with FiO 2 of 30% and positive end-expiratory pressure of 8, which became 100% and 14 respectively. The P:F ratio dropped to 62. Her leukocytes were 10.6\u00d710 9 /l a few hours earlier and went down to 1.5\u00d710 9 /l after the onset. Previous lactate was normal, but jumped to 42 mg/dl. She was free of vasopressors and after the off ending transfusion went through refractory shock and died approximately 24 hours after the blood transfusion. Conclusion For our knowledge this is the fi rst case reported of TRALI in an infl uenza A (H1N1) patient. Although blood transfusion can be life saving, it also can be a life-threatening intervention. Prevention is still the best hit. References Introduction Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) has been suggested as a measure to terminate trauma and dabigatran-induced bleeding. Owing to the confl icting data concerning such therapy, we investigated the impact of a four-factor PCC to terminate massive bleeding following the infl iction of multiple trauma in dabigatran anticoagulated pigs. Methods After ethical approval, 24 male pigs were administered dabigatran etexilate (30 mg/kg bid p.o.) for 3 days. On day 4, dabigatran in anaesthetised animals was infused prior to injury to achieve supratherapeutic levels. Twelve minutes after infl iction of bilateral femur fractures and standardised blunt liver injury, animals randomly received PCC (25, 50 or 100 IU/kg; n = 6) or placebo (n = 6). Time-adjusted blood loss as primary endpoint (observation period 300 minutes) and a panel of coagulation variables were continually measured. Data were analysed by two-way ANOVA. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM. Results Concentrations of dabigatran prior to infl iction of trauma was comparable between groups (590 \u00b1 40 ng/ml). Anticoagulation with dabigatran and trauma caused severe coagulopathy as shown by prolonged TEM variables (CT, CFT), PT and aPTT. Following PCC application these eff ects were partially reversed. Due to ongoing blood loss both PT and TEM variables prolonged over time in PCC 25 IU/kg substituted animals. Accordingly, no-PCC (38.5 \u00b1 4.7 ml/minute) and PCC 25 IU/kg (22.6 \u00b1 5.5 ml/minute) animals showed highest blood loss (P <0.05 vs. PCC 50 IU/kg and PCC 100 IU/kg) with a mean survival time of 106 minutes (no-PCC animals) and 204 minutes for PCC 25 IU/kg animals, respectively. All animals of the PCC 50 IU/kg and PCC 100 IU/kg group survived. Blood loss in both groups was comparable (PCC 50 IU/ kg: 5.9 \u00b1 0.2 ml/minute; PCC 100 IU/kg 6.0 \u00b1 0.3 ml/minute).",

Following the 90-minute infusion of dabigatran, the mean plasma levels of dabigatran increased to 1,423 \u00b1 432 ng/ ml. This supra-therapeutic level was associated with a further prolongation of PT, aPTT, and the EXTEM variables CT and CFT. These changes in coagulation parameters were compounded by blood loss following trauma (total blood loss at 60 minutes: 1,978 \u00b1 265 ml). Sixty minutes after trauma, four out of fi ve animals had no measurable clot formation (EXTEM CFT \u22654,000 seconds) and clot strength (EXTEM MCF) had reduced to 11 \u00b1 7 mm.

Such features may provide useful information about the vascular system and are traditionally explained in terms of aortic valve closure or multiple refl ections from impedance mismatches within the arterial system. However, experimental evidence of such refl ections has been elusive. It has been proposed that arterial dynamics may obey a nonlinear equation [1] . This model predicts the existence of multipeaked solitons which can travel long distances without dissipation. We demonstrate that within the soliton model it is not necessary to model valve closure or wave refl ection: single or multiple notches arise de novo even from featureless theoretical LV pressure pulse profi les. We show that a number of clinically relevant features of the invasive blood pressure are reproduced by the soliton model and examine the role of LV pulse energy on pulse wave shape and progression. Methods A model for the arterial pressure is given by solutions to a KdV equation with constants depending on the properties of the artery [1] . This can be solved with the initial condition of a parabolic left ventricular pressure pulse.",

Many studies have shown decreased morbidity in major surgery when perioperative goal-directed therapy (PGDT) is used. We assessed the clinical and economic burden of postsurgical complications in the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) in order to predict potential savings with PGDT. Methods Data from adults who had 10 major surgical procedures in 2011 were screened in the UHC database. Thirteen postsurgical complications were tabulated. In-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay and costs from patients with and without complications were compared. The risk ratios reported by the most recent meta-analysis were used to estimate the potential reduction in postsurgical morbidity with PGDT. Potential cost savings were calculated from the actual and anticipated morbidity rates. Patients were randomly selected and catheterization was performed in a neutral position of the head (n = 50) and by turning the head 45\u00b0 to the opposite side (n = 50). The US-guided catheterization procedure was performed in accordance with general principles. Once the needle entered the IJV and blood was aspirated, the US probe was released from the hand, and the catheter was placed and fi xed according to the Seldinger technique. The data of the intervention side for each process, the count number of successful catheter insertion, whether there is arterial access or not and the duration of procedure (from skin contact of the needle to catheter insertion) were recorded.",

But ultrasound may not be available in emergency situations, and therefore guidelines also propose that physicians remained skilled in landmark (LM) placement. We conducted this prospective observational study to determine the learning curve of the LM technique in residents only learning the UG technique. Methods During the fi rst 3 months of their rotation in our ICU, residents inexperienced in CVC used only the real-time UG technique. During the following 3 months, residents were allowed to place CVC by means of the LM technique when authorized by the attending physician. Results A total of 172 procedures (84 UG and 88 LM) were performed by the inexperienced residents during the study. The success rate was lower (72% vs. 84%; P = 0.05) and the complication rate was higher (22% vs. 10%; P = 0.04) for LM compared with UG procedures. Comparison between the fi ve last UG procedures and the fi rst fi ve LM procedures performed demonstrated that the transition between the two techniques was associated with a marked decrease of the success rate (65% vs. 93%; P = 0.01) and an increase of the complication rate (33% vs. 8%; P = 0.01). After 10 LM procedures, residents achieved a success rate and a complication rate of 81% and 6%, respectively. Conclusion Residents who only learn the UG technique will not be immediately able to perform the LM technique, but require specifi c training based on at least 10 LM procedures. Whether the LM technique should still be taught when an ultrasound device is not available must therefore be addressed.",

Changes in carotid fl ow time have been proposed as a marker of volume status, but few data support their use. We sought to determine whether carotid fl ow time decreased in the volume-depleted state of acute blood loss, and whether volume-depleted individuals would demonstrate an increase in carotid fl ow time after a passive leg raise (PLR) maneuver. Methods Volunteers aged 18 to 55 presenting to the hospital's blood donor center for whole blood donation were eligible to participate. Individuals with a history of aortic or carotid artery disease, atrial fi brillation, or a contraindication to blood donation were excluded. Prior to blood donation, an investigator performed an ultrasound of the right common carotid artery with a high-frequency linear transducer, obtaining a Doppler tracing of carotid artery fl ow. Measurements of peak velocity, systole time, and carotid fl ow time were obtained. A PLR was performed for 30 seconds, followed by repeat measurements of carotid velocity and fl ow time. Whole blood was then collected according to the blood donor center's protocol. Immediately after blood donation, repeat measurements of carotid fl ow and velocity were obtained in the supine position and after a PLR. Carotid fl ow times corrected for heart rate (FTc) were analyzed with Student's t test. The institutional review board approved the study. Results Eighty donors were screened for participation by two investigators; 68 consented and completed donation (60.3% female, mean age 31). Donors had mean blood loss of 450 ml. The mean FTc supine after blood donation was 296 ms; this was signifi cantly diff erent from the FTc prior to donation (supine = 320 ms, PLR = 323 ms; P <0.0001). The mean FTc following blood donation and PLR was 321 ms, signifi cantly diff erent from the supine position after donation (P <0.0001), but not pre-donation measurements. Conclusion Ultrasound measurement of carotid fl ow time was signifi cantly decreased in the setting of acute blood loss. An autobolus by PLR after blood loss restored FTc to pre-donation levels. Further investigation of FTc as a non-invasive predictor of volume responsiveness is warranted. Introduction Central venous catheters play an important role in patient care; however, their use is associated with various complications and more frequently through the subclavian vein (SCV) route. A previous study showed that ultrasound-guided cannulation of the SCV in critical care patients is superior to the landmark method and should be the method of choice in these patients [1] . The aim of this study was to compare short-axis and long-axis approaches for ultrasound-guided subclavian vein cannulation with respect to indicators of success. Methods Eighty-three patients undergoing cardiac surgery and requiring central venous cannulation were randomized to receive longaxis or short-axis ultrasound-guided cannulation of the subclavian vein by a skilled anesthesiologist. First-pass success, unsuccessful placement, number of attempts, number of needle passes, skin and vessel puncture, time to successful catheterization and complications were considered as outcomes.",

Central venous cannulation failed in two and 10 cases respectively with short-axis and long-axis view and the other view was used successfully. The fi rst-pass success rate was signifi cantly higher in the short-axis group (73%) compared with the long-axis group (40%) (P = 0.005). The procedure time, number of attempts, needle redirection, and skin and vessel punctures were signifi cantly lower in the short-axis than long-axis group (P <0.05). The overall number of complications did not diff er signifi cantly between groups even if artery puncture and hematoma occurred more frequently in the long-axis group. Moreover, the need to change the ultrasoundguided insertion technique was more frequent in the long-axis group. Conclusion Ultrasound-guided subclavian vein cannulation by an experienced operator has a higher fi rst-pass success rate and lower access time using the short-axis than long-axis approach.

In many circumstances, transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) is the preferred monitoring tool. It can aid in cannula positioning, especially during double-lumen cannula placement for V-V ECMO, weaning of V-A ECMO and diagnose causes of high-access pressures and circuit fl ow problems. We use TOE as our preferred monitoring equipment before, during and after establishing ECMO. We sought to investigate how often information gained from TOE imaging had a major impact on management decisions. Methods A single-centre observational study at a tertiary referral institution. All patients supported with V-A or V-V ECMO during an 18-month period were included. Routine procedures such as wire position checks during cannulation or information gained to assist weaning from V-A support were not included. Results Twenty patients were supported with either V-A (all peripheral) or V-V ECMO during the observation period. In 12 patients (60%) TOE was instrumental in diagnosing potentially fatal complications or altered clinical management. In three patients on V-A support, afterload reduction and modulation of inotropic support was necessary due to extensive spontaneous echo contrast formation in the left ventricle and stagnant pulmonary blood fl ow; two out of these three patients, immediately after establishing support, required intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation to reverse clot formation around the aortic valve and root. Introduction Right-sided precordial leads (V3R to V5R) and posterior chest leads (V7 to V9) provide important information for the right ventricle and posterior wall. These additional lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) improve diagnostic value in acute coronary syndrome patients [1] . However, these additional electrocardiograms are not routinely recorded due to the time-consuming procedure involved. Recently these synthesized six additional lead ECGs using the standard 12-lead ECG system (Nihonkoden Co. Ltd) have been developed [2, 3] . But the accuracy is not clear. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of synthesized ECGs at the ST part.",

After haemodynamic stabilisation, PWV was recorded at inclusion and after 48 hours using dual-channel plethysmography. Severity of illness was assessed with APACHE II and serial SOFA scores, haemodynamic and infl ammatory parameters (CRP, procalcitonin and fi brinogen) recorded. A 28-day follow-up was performed to distinguish between survivors and nonsurvivors. Results Twenty consecutive general ICU patients (six with severe sepsis and 14 with septic shock) were enrolled in the study; median age 59 years (IQR 56.5 to 72), APACHE II score 17 (13 to 20.5), SOFA score 5 (IQR 4 to 9). At 28 days, six patients had died. Median initial PWV was 10.4 (IQR 6.9 to 12.1) m/second in patients with severe sepsis, and 6.8 (IQR 5.3 to 7.5) m/second in patients with septic shock (P = 0.13). After 48 hours, PWV in the severe sepsis and septic shock groups had become similar, 9.3 (IQR 7.3 to 11.1) m/second and 9.2 (IQR 7.8 to 13) m/second respectively (P = 0.96). PWV had signifi cantly increased in survivors (7.8 to 12.3 m/second) (P = 0.04) versus nonsurvivors (6 to 7.8 m/second) (P = 0.69).

Conclusion In early sepsis, aortic stiff ness is decreased in patients with greater disease severity, and in survivors increases to median levels within 48 hours. The main factors associated with lower pulse wave velocity are lower systolic pressure and higher CRP levels. The association of high serum CRP levels with low aortic stiff ness in patients with sepsis does not match data described in the literature [1] . Reference ",

Methods The esCCO technique is a novel noncalibrated non-invasive method of cardiac output monitoring. It is based on the estimation of pulse pressure from the speed of pulse wave propagation, which is measured as a time delay between the ECG R-wave and the corresponding peripheral pulse wave detected by pulse oximetry -the delay being called the pulse wave transit time (PWTT) [1] . LiDCOrapid estimates noncalibrated cardiac output (nCO) by pulse wave contour analysis from an arterial line and is a well-established monitoring modality in our department. The patients planned for elective major abdominal surgery with ASA score of III and expected operation duration over 90 minutes are routinely monitored by LiDCOrapid with a perioperative hemodynamic optimalization protocol. In accordance with the protocol, an arterial line was inserted and LiDCOrapid monitoring was started before the induction of anesthesia. At the same time, non-invasive esCCO monitoring was started. Results Ten patients were monitored with a total of 141 esCCO-nCO measurement pairs. The correlation coeffi cient between esCCO and nCO was 0.65 and in the Bland-Altman diff erence analysis bias was +1.2 l/minute and 95% limits of agreement were \u00b1 2.6 l/minute. The change of cardiac output between two consecutive measurements detected by LiDCOrapid was detected by esCCO in 80% of cases. Conclusion Hemodynamic monitoring with esCCO yields cardiac output values diff erent from those measured by LiDCOrapid. The reliability of PWTT is questionable when systemic vascular resistance ",

The invasiveness of current technology may prevent clinicians from obtaining hemodynamic information. We developed a noninvasive system for detection of hemodynamic variables utilizing a photo-acoustic sensor (PA-S) and indicator dilution. The PA-S utilizes a combination of a miniature ultrasound sensor, a laser diode and an optical detector to accomplish the measurement. Methods Five pigs weighing 25 to 29 kg were used in the study approved by the local animal use and care committee. The animals were anesthetized, medically paralyzed, intubated and mechanically ventilated. Central venous and arterial catheters were placed for injection of the indicator and connection to the PiCCO system. The PA-S was placed in contact with the skin over the saphenous artery on the animal and adjusted to receive the maximum acoustic signal. The adjustment included the depth of ultrasonic penetration and the exact location on top of the blood vessel. Each indicator dilution was accomplished using three central venous injections of 15 ml normal saline at room temperature. Variation in CO was accomplished by removing up to 50% of the blood volume after splenectomy. The PA-S results were obtained using the empirical regression method.

Methods We studied 50 Thai surgical patients undergoing CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass and requiring pulmonary artery catheter and radial artery catheter placement as a standard of clinical care. All patients were measured for APCO using the Vigileo/FloTrac and for esCCO using the esCCO monitoring system. The data were compared with thermodilution cardiac output (TDCO) monitoring as a reference method, simultaneously at pre-induction, post-induction, and every 30 minutes thereafter until the completion of the surgery. The bias and precision were assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. Results In total, 310 pairs of simultaneous measurements of APCO versus TDCO and 303 pairs of esCCO versus TDCO were obtained from 50 patients. Both APCO (R = 0.53, P <0.0001) and esCCO values (R = 0.56, P <0.0001) were correlated with TDCO values. Either of the changes in APCO (R = 0.63, P <0.0001) or any changes in esCCO (R = 0.60, P <0.0001) were correlated with changes in TDCO. For APCO relative to TDCO, the bias, precision, and the limits of agreement were 0.70, 1.63, and -2.5 to 3.9 l/minute, while those of esCCO were 1.20, 1.59, and -1.9 to 4.3 l/ minute, respectively. Comparisons of the bias of APCO and esCCO revealed a level of signifi cance of P <0.001.

Introduction Goal-directed therapy used in the perioperative period of patients undergoing cardiac surgery shortens the length of ICU stay [1] . We aimed to compare the postoperative results of the liberal and restrictive fl uid strategy used in patients undergoing pulmonary resection surgery (PRC). Methods We have been using the restrictive fl uid strategy since March 2013 in our institute. Patients who were on the liberal fl uid regime were analyzed retrospectively. From March 2013 until today, patients who were on restrictive fl uid strategy were analyzed prospectively. A total of 125 patients were included in the study. Age, duration of anesthesia, type of fl uids given intraoperatively, fl uid index (ml/kg/hour), fl uid intake/output balance, creatinine and lactate levels were compared with pulmonary and renal morbidity, and length of stay in ICU, using multivariate analysis. Results A signifi cant correlation (P <0.05) was established between the amount of crystalloid given intraoperatively, fl uid index and fl uid balance with pulmonary morbidity (n = 52). The fl uid index and inotropes usage were correlated with the postoperative creatinine levels (P <0.05).",

Four percent of the patients required renal replacement therapy and the overall mortality was 0.8%. Conclusion To reduce the morbidity of patients undergoing major surgery, the protocols of using the restrictive fl uid strategy in the perioperative period and simultaneous protection of end organs, especially the kidneys, is currently the subject of this discussion. We observed that the restrictive fl uid strategy did not lead to global organ hypoperfusion, which was monitored by lactate. Even though there was a negative correlation between the fl uid index with creatinine levels and renal failure, the need for renal replacement therapy was observed only in one case. As a conclusion, the postoperative pulmonary morbidity and length of ICU stay can be reduced in patients who undergo PRC by using the restrictive fl uid strategy (4.2 \u00b1 0.3 ml/kg/hour), without causing any vital organ dysfunction.

Results Thirty-two patients (56% female, median age 64) were studied over a median of 3 critical care days (range 1 to 7).

Interpretation of the RI in clinical practice is diffi cult due to interaction with cardiac output, heart rate (HR) and blood pressure [1, 2] . The impact of global hemodynamics on the RI remains to be evaluated. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the RI and changes in central hemodynamic during a central hypovolemia model in healthy volunteers (HV). Methods Eleven healthy volunteers (27 \u00b1 8 years; eight male) participated in this study. Two diff erent models were performed: the fi rst model was performed by applying the head-up tilt (HUT) test. The complete maneuver was done by a 10-minute step that consisted of tilting the table from a supine position (Sup) to an angle of 70\u00b0 (HUT) and back to supine (Sup'). The second model was performed by applying three consecutive valsalva maneuvers. Global hemodynamics included stroke volume (SV), HR, and mean arterial pressure, which were continuously measured non-invasively with a Finometer. At least three RI readings were obtained and averaged from the right and left kidneys in all HV. Results All HV had a signifi cant decrease of SV from 83 \u00b1 17 ml to 63 \u00b1 14 ml and an increase in HR from 67 \u00b1 10 bpm to 88 \u00b1 13 bpm during the HUT. Figure 1 shows the temporal changes of mean RI in both kidneys. A signifi cant decrease in the RI in both kidneys was seen during HUT. After the move back to supine, RI returned to baseline values, with a signifi cant variation of RI in the early measurements on the right kidney compared with late measurements on the left kidney (0.67 \u00b1 0.05 vs. 0.61 \u00b1 0.05, P <0.05). Valsalva maneuvers signifi cantly increased the RI in the right and left kidneys, from 0.6 \u00b1 0.04 and 0.6 \u00b1 0.05 to 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 and 0.68 \u00b1 0.15 (P <0.05), respectively.

Introduction Dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn), defi ned as the pulse pressure variation (PPV) to stroke volume variation (SVV) ratio, has been suggested as a predictor of the arterial pressure response to fl uid administration. Rather than a steady-state assessment, Eadyn depicts the actual slope of the pressure-volume relationship providing a dynamic evaluation of the arterial load. So the higher the Eadyn value, the more likely arterial blood pressure is to improve after fl uid challenge (FC). The aim of this study was to assess the eff ectiveness of Eadyn, measured non-invasively in preload-dependent, spontaneously breathing patients. Methods Patients admitted postoperatively and monitored with the Nexfi n monitor were enrolled in the study. Patients were included if they were spontaneously breathing and had an increase in cardiac output \u226510% after a FC. They were classifi ed according to the increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) after FC into MAP-responders (MAP increase \u226510%) and MAP-nonresponders (MAP increase <10%). Eadyn was calculated from the PPV and SVV values obtained from the monitor. Results A total of 34 FCs from 26 patients were studied. Seventeen FCs (50%) induced a positive MAP response. Preinfusion Eadyn was signifi cantly higher in MAP-responders (1.39 \u00b1 0.41 vs. 0.85 \u00b1 0.23; P = 0.0001) ( Figure 1 ). Preinfusion Eadyn predicted a positive MAP response to FC with an area under the ROC curve of 0.92 \u00b1 0.04 of SE (95% CI: 0.78 to 0.99; P <0.0001). A preinfusion Eadyn value \u22651.06 (grey zone: 0.9 to 1.15) discriminated MAP-responders with a sensitivity and specifi city of 88.2% (95% CI: 64 to 99%). Conclusion Non-invasive dynamic arterial elastance, defi ned as the PPV to SVV ratio, predicted the arterial pressure increase to fl uid administration in spontaneously, preload-dependent patients. Introduction According to Guyton and colleagues [1] , expansion of blood volume can increase cardiac output (CO) in so far as the change in volume aff ects the mean systemic fi lling pressure (Pmsf ). However, rapid stress relaxation occurs after acute intravascular volume expansion so that the eff ect of volume on Pmsf and CO may disappear after a few minutes. The objective of the present study is to describe the extent of the haemodynamic changes generated by a fl uid challenge during 10 minutes on critically ill patients.",

Then 250 ml Hartmann's solution or Volplex was infused over 5 minutes. Data were recorded automatically from baseline to 10 minutes after the end of fl uid infusion. The time to maximum response and percentage change between baseline and last value of diff erent haemodynamic parameters are also reported. Results Sixty fl uid challenges were studied in 34 patients, with a mean duration of 5.3 minutes (\u00b1 2.5). In 22 events (37%), CO increased more than 10% (responders). The change between baseline and last value was greater in nonresponders for heart effi ciency (Eh) (-9.2% \u00b1 9.7 vs. -3.1% \u00b1 13.9, P = 0.05) but not in other haemodynamic variables. Time to maximal response on CO was 2 minutes after the end of the infusion ( Figure 1 ). Conclusion Stress relaxation damps down the eff ect of a fl uid challenge after 10 minutes except in terms of heart effi ciency. The eff ect of a fl uid challenge should be assessed up to 2 minutes after the end of fl uid infusion. Failure to do so may mislead clinicians about the patient's fl uid responsiveness. ",

Both groups had the vasoactive drug infusions titrated and tapered to maintain a target mean blood pressure. The analysis included the total time of use and dosage of vasopressors every 6 hours, the move to single organ dysfunction and multiple organ failure, length of ICU stay and hospitalization, and mortality 7, 14 and 28 days after the start of infusions. Results A total of 407 patients underwent randomization but 387 patients were included in this study (191 patients received vasopressin, and 196 received norepinephrine only). The total time for vasopressors was 37 hours and 68 hours in the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups with P = 0.02. Single organ dysfunction and multiple organ dysfunction using vasopressin and norepinephrine were respectively: 37.7% vs. 49.2%, P = 0.02; and 17.8% vs. 26%; P = 0.05. Length of stay in the ICU was 14 and 17 days (P = 0.29) and the time of hospitalization was 23 and 28 days (P = 0.11) respectively. There was a signifi cant diff erence between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in the mortality rate at 14 and 28 days (29.3% vs. 36.7%, P = 0.05; 34% and 42.3%, P = 0.03), but there were no signifi cant diff erences in the overall rates for 7-day mortality (21.2% vs. 23.9%, respectively; P = 1.1). Conclusion Early application of vasopressin reduced the time of vasopressor use, progression to multiple organ dysfunction, length of stay in the ICU, and mortality rates at 14 and 28 days as compared with norepinephrine only. This observed diff erence can be attributed to early restoration of tissue perfusion in the control group making the state of septic shock shorter and reducing the potential for multiple organ dysfunction, which directly infl uenced patient survival. Reference Methods A 28-year-old man was admitted to the ICU following intubation and sedation for seizures due to acute alcohol withdrawal. A CT scan of the brain was normal. In the ICU the patient became haemodynamically unstable and fresh blood was aspirated from the nasogastric tube. Gastroscopy showed bleeding oesphageal varicies and hypertensive portal gastropathy. The patient was treated with variceal banding, tazobactam/pipacillin (4.5 g three times daily) and terlipressin (2 g four times daily) as per protocol for variceal bleeding. He was successfully extubated 48 hours later. Results On admission the patient's serum sodium was 139 mmol/l. The patient received terlipressin for 4 days in the following regimen: 2 g four times daily for 48 hours, then 1 mg four times daily for 24 hours and then 0.5 mg four times daily for a further 24 hours before stopping. On the last day of his terlipressin therapy, the patient's GCS dropped from 15 to 11. Serum sodium had fallen acutely to 116 mmol/l. The last two doses of terlipressin were cancelled and no other treatment for hyponatraemia was administered. His serum sodium and GCS returned to normal limits within 13 hours of terlipressin cessation with no neurological consequences.",

            "text": "Introduction Patients with distributive shock who require high-dose vasopressors have a high mortality. Vasopressors belong to two classes: catecholamines and vasopressin analogs. Each class has limitations. Patients receiving catecholamines often develop tachyphylaxis and metabolic complications (for example, lactic acidosis). Vasopressin analogs can cause mesenteric or myocardial ischemia and oliguria. Angiotensin II (ATII) is an endogenous peptide that increases blood pressure and aldosterone production. Preclinical data suggest a role for ATII in the treatment of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. ATII may prove useful in patients who remain hypotensive despite catecholamine and vasopressin therapy. This is the fi rst randomized clinical trial to date which seeks to evaluate ATII for use in distributive shock. Methods Twenty patients with distributive shock and a cardiovascular Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score \u22654 were randomized to either ATII infusion (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) plus standard of care. ATII was started at a dose of 20 ng/kg/minute, and titrated per a protocolized schedule for a goal of maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg. The infusion (either ATII or placebo) was continued for 6 hours and then titrated off . The primary endpoint was the eff ect of ATII on the standing dose of norepinephrine required to maintain a MAP of 65 mmHg. Secondary endpoints included the eff ect of ATII on urine output, serum lactate and creatinine clearance, as well as 30-day mortality.",

The 30-day mortality for the two groups were similar for the ATII cohort and the placebo cohort (50% vs. 60%, P = 1.00). ATII resulted in marked reduction in norepinephrine dosing in all patients.

Conclusion ATII is an eff ective vasopressor agent in patients with distributive shock requiring multiple vasopressors.

Introduction Fall in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) during anaesthetic induction is common and may result in profound hypotension. Using the LiDCORapid (LiDCO Ltd, UK), we previously demonstrated that the fall in MAP is usually driven by a reduction in stroke volume (SV) that was presumed due to venodilation. Lowdose phenylephrine (PE), a venoconstrictor, commenced immediately prior to induction ameliorated these eff ects to a signifi cant degree [1] . However, it is important that the pre-induction administration of PE should not cause any marked changes in MAP and CO. We retrospectively studied a group of 40 high-risk patients about to undergo major peripheral vascular surgery where PE was commenced immediately pre-induction. The haemodynamic eff ects of this dose of PE on MAP, SV and CO were analysed. Methods A radial artery line was inserted prior to induction of anaesthesia, and baseline MAP, CO and SV were obtained using the LiDCORapid. The PE infusion was commenced at a rate of 1 to 2 mg/ hour. Remifentanil was then administered using a target-controlled infusion pump until a 2 ng/ml predicted eff ect site concentration (Ceff ) was reached. Propofol was then administered to induce anaesthesia.",

Reference Introduction Acetaminophen (APAP) is commonly administered in the surgical ICU (SICU) for its analgesic and antipyretic eff ects. Case reports have described the potential for APAP to cause allergic reactions with and without hypotension. Furthermore, there have been case reports of APAP causing isolated hypotension in the absence of other allergic responses [1] . This has been well described following intravenous administration [2] . However, other routes of administration causing hypotension and associated diagnoses remain to be elucidated. The present case series describes 11 patients with APAP-induced hypotension in the SICU at a Level I trauma center.",

These patients developed cardiogenic shock during 72 hours after cardiac surgery. In all cases, ECMO was inserted after cardiac surgery. Of all patients, 32 (66%) were central ECMO, inserted in the operative room, and 16 were percutaneous, inserted in the ICU. The median duration of ventricular assistance was 6 days (IQR 0 to 41), the length of ICU stay was 16 days (IQR 1 to 111), and hospital stay was 29 days (IQR 1 to 198). Twenty patients survived (41%) and were discharged from our hospital. Conclusion The use of mechanical circulatory assists devices is an effi cient tool to manage seriously ill patients after cardiac surgery. This tool should be considered early in the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock after cardiac surgery. Introduction Mortality from cardiogenic shock remains high [1] and, despite a physiological rationale, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) has recently been shown to be ineff ective in reducing mortality [2, 3] .

In a subgroup, advanced HPs (central venous saturation (SvO 2 ), peripheral temperature (PT), cardiac index (CI), global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI) and extravascular lung water (ELWI)) were compared with levels of SL. Methods An observational prospective, single-center, pilot study was performed in intensive care (IC) of a medium-sized teaching hospital. Adult patients with severe sepsis were included and received standard goal-directed therapy (Surviving Sepsis Guidelines). Every patient received an arterial line and a central venous line in the upper diaphragm position. A subgroup received pulse contour cardiac output (PiCCO)-guided resuscitation and PT measurements. Pearson correlation coeffi cients (PCCs) were calculated between HPs and SL, which were measured every 4 hours for the fi rst 48 hours after inclusion.

The most frequent reasons for IC admission were abdominal sepsis (n = 11) and pneumosepsis (n = 7). Mean HPs (with SD and range) were respectively: Figure 1 shows the relation between two HPs with the highest correlation with SL.

CV Sepsis alert screens the EHR to identify the presence of infection based on a multifactor alert system including labs, vital signs, and treatment team documentation. A physician order for intravenous antibiotics was used as a surrogate for suspected infection. The database identifi ed 37,160 consecutive patients treated for infection from a total of 216,550. Patients with a measured lactate were divided relative to its measurement within 3 hours (eLac) or greater than 3 hours (dLac) of sepsis identifi cation as recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. The CV Sepsis alert was the reference standard for time zero. Patients were compared in each group for the occurrence of the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality. Results A total 5,072 of 37,160 consecutive patients (13%) had a measured lactate. Sepsis patients experienced an overall 3% (1,186/37,160) mortality rate. In total, 4,153 (82%) patients had measured lactate within 3 hours, and 919 (18%) were delayed, with a decreased morality rate (eLac 6.8 vs. dLac 24.7, P <0.0001). There was no diff erence in average lactate levels between the groups (eLac: 2.1 \u00b1 2.6, dLac: 2.3 \u00b1 3.0, P = NS). A larger ratio of delayed-lactate patients had a lactate \u22654 mmol/l (dLac 12.6% vs. eLac 8.7%). Conclusion The delay in lactate assessment relative to clinical evidence of infection was associated with an increased mortality rate. The average lactate level in each group did not account for this eff ect. The timing of the assessment, not the lactate level, was prognostic of outcome. The mortality benefi t associated with lactate assessment within the 3-hour guideline suggests that an increased clinical awareness may lead to early initiation of time-sensitive interventions known to improve outcomes. Introduction The objective of this study was to determine whether lactate clearance (LC) is a signifi cant indicator of mortality in patients with colorectal perforation. LC has been associated with mortality in heterogeneous critically ill patients, but its role as a predictor of mortality in homogeneous patients with colorectal perforation is unclear.",

Patients with traumatic, iatrogenic, and appendicitis perforations were excluded. The primary endpoint was survival to hospital discharge. The modifi ed Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (mSOFA) score, a customized SOFA score excluding the central nervous system component [1] , was used for prognostic scoring. The mSOFA score and several clinical factors were analyzed by univariate analysis as possible predictors of survival. We collected lactate levels and base excess (BE) measured during surgery and at 6, 12, and 24 hours after the fi rst measurement and calculated the respective LC values. The associations of initial blood lactate level, LC, and BE with mortality were assessed by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and logistic regression analyses. Introduction Measurement of arterial lactate (A-LACT) levels has been used to monitor poor tissue perfusion, predicting mortality and guiding resuscitation. Peripheral venous lactate (V-LACT) has been regarded as an unreliable test, but a less invasive approach. We aimed to determine correlation between A-LACT and V-LACT and agreement of both in order to determine the usefulness of V-LACT as a biomarker for assessment in sepsis. ",

            "text": "Results Patients with HDLVEF had increased mortality in hospital, at 28 days and at 1 year when compared with patients with NLVEF. HDLVEF patients more frequently required renal replacement therapy (RRT), vasopressors and mechanical ventilation. Of the 2,632 patients, 1,220 were septic. There was an increased proportion of HDLVEF in the septic compared with the nonseptic groups (11.2% vs. 8.6%, P = 0.026). Interestingly, other statistically signifi cant associated comorbidities were cancer, CHF, arrhythmias, and hypertension, which were more commonly seen in the HDLVEF group. See Table 1 . Introduction Pulmonary regurgitation (PR) that develops after right ventricular (RV) outfl ow reconstruction including the Rastelli and Norwood procedure may often result in serious cardiac events early after surgery. We hypothesized that PR may be associated with pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and RV contraction. Accordingly, we assessed the impact of PVR on PR and RV function using a swine model. Methods Eight pigs (14 \u00b1 2 kg) underwent total resection of the pulmonary valve cusps under cardiopulmonary bypass (PR group). This was compared with a control group (n = 6) that underwent only bypass. In both groups, the pulmonary regurgitant fraction (PRF) and cardiac output were measured by a pulsed Doppler fl ow meter, and the percent segmental shortening of RV (%RVSS) and RV end-diastolic dimension (RVDd) were measured by sonomicrometry. We also performed dobutamine stress evaluation as well as changing the PVR by carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) and inhaled nitric oxide (NO). Results All bypass time was 18 \u00b1 3 minutes. In the PR group, the PRF was 40 \u00b1 4% and the RVDd was 53 \u00b1 9 mm* (vs. control 34 \u00b1 6 mm). *P <0.05. A signifi cant reduction in the %RVSS (18 \u00b1 1%* vs. control 22 \u00b1 1%) and the cardiac output (2.1 \u00b1 0.2 l/minute* vs. control 2.5 \u00b1 0.3 l/minute) were observed. The PRFs were 60 \u00b1 5% (PaCO 2 >80 mmHg), 37 \u00b1 2% (PaCO 2 <20 mmHg), 24 \u00b1 2% (NO 20 ppm; PaCO 2 40 mmHg), and were positively correlated with the PVR ( Figure 1A ). During the dobutamine stress, the %RVSS was increased (baseline 18 \u00b1 1%, 5\u03b3 21 \u00b1 2%, 10\u03b3 26 \u00b1 3%), and was negatively correlated with the PRFs (Figure 1B) . Conclusion These results indicated that massive PR resulted in marked deterioration of RV performance; however, low PVR and high RV contractility may contribute to reduce the severity of PR and improve cardiac function. Nitric oxide may be a useful treatment modality the Introduction Cardiogenic oscillation is the fl uctuation in fl ow tracing in mechanically ventilated patients. Large cardiogenic oscillation may cause autotriggering in adult patients after cardiac surgery [1] and inaccurate volume monitoring [2] . However, it is unknown how cardiogenic oscillation is problematic in pediatric patients. Therefore, we prospectively surveyed cardiogenic oscillation in pediatric patients after cardiac surgery. Methods We enrolled 17 pediatric patients who underwent cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. They were mechanically ventilated with pressure-controlled ventilation. We measured the amplitude in cardiogenic oscillation and compared them between their admission to the ICU and before extubation. We performed statistical analysis with the t test and considered P <0.05 signifi cant. Results Cardiogenic oscillation was 2.1 \u00b1 0.6 l/minute just after the surgery ( Figure 1 ). Autotriggering occurred in seven of 17 patients when triggering sensitivity was set at 1 l/minute. Before the extubation, cardiogenic oscillation signifi cantly decreased to 1. Introduction Postoperative new-onset atrial fi brillation (PNAF) is very common after cardiac surgery. The infl ammatory response due to surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may contribute to PNAF by inducing atrial dysfunction [1] . Corticosteroids reduce the infl ammatory response and may thus reduce atrial dysfunction and PNAF [2] . The aim of this study was to determine whether dexamethasone protects from left atrial dysfunction and PNAF in cardiac surgical patients.",

TCM is frequent in patients with adrenergic overstimulation and is probably common in ICU patients [1] . In a TCM rat model we evaluated whether diff erent anesthetic agents could attenuate LV akinesia in TCM. Methods Isoprenaline was intraperitoneal (i.p.) injected, which induces LV akinesia and apical ballooning within 90 minutes [2] . We performed the study in two diff erent settings. In the fi rst setting, spontaneously breathing rats (n = 12 in each group) were sedated with either pentobarbital, ketamine, isofl urane or no anesthetic before i.p. isoprenaline. One additional group received the K-ATP blocker glyburide before sedation with isofl urane. In the second setting, rats were anaesthetized with ketamine + midazolam, mechanically ventilated and the carotid artery was cannulated. Before i.p. isoprenaline, animals were randomized to either no isofl urane (0 MAC), isofl urane 0.5 MAC or isofl urane 1.0 MAC (n = 12 in each group). Arterial blood gas was obtained before isoprenaline and 60 minutes after isoprenaline. The heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and body temperature (BT) were recorded continuously. After 90 minutes, echocardiography was performed. Extent of akinesia was expressed as the percentage of total LV endocardial length. End-diastolic and end-systolic LV volumes were measured, and stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) were calculated.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the still-debated impact of preoperative use of ACEI on postoperative renal function in cardiac surgery patients [1, 2] . Methods A total of 624 consecutive patients, who underwent cardiac surgery from July 2012 to October 2013, were evaluated. Data were prospectively collected in our clinic's electronic database and were retrospectively analyzed as to preoperative ACEI therapy. The chisquare test was used for correlations. Endpoints of the study were the development of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and the diff erence between hospital admission and discharge glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR In-hospital mortality was higher in group 2 (0 vs. 4.6%, P = 0.094). Conclusion A primary visit to a local hospital was associated with longer reperfusion time and was associated with higher mortality. Therefore, the reperfusion time could be reduced by patient education and management of the community healthcare system. Introduction A potential measure of post-ischemic milieu in myocardium subject to acute ischemic injury is to assess the socalled myocardial salvage index (SI) by relating the fi nal infarct size to the initial myocardium at risk (MaR). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has previously been shown to enable determination of both infarct size using late gadolinium enhancement and MaR using T2weighted imaging. This technique could thus potentially be used to identify infl ammatory responses that could be targeted to accomplish cardioprotection. The aim of this study was to relate SI, as determined by CMR, to the infl ammatory response in patients with acute myocardial infarction.",

The recently introduced high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (HS cTnT) assay has resulted in an increased detection of elevated cTnT in ICU patients [1] . The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of elevated cTnT using the HS assay and its relationship with mortality. Methods A retrospective observational study was performed on all ICU admissions over a 12-month period. Data were obtained from the clinical information system (ICIP; Philips) and the ICU audit databases (AcuBase). Data collected included patient demographics, peak cTnT value, APACHE II score, requirement for organ support and mortality. The primary outcome measure was hospital mortality. Data were analysed using SPSS v.17.0. cTnT levels were divided into categories for analysis: normal (<14 ng/l) and elevated. The elevated category was further subdivided into quartiles. Univariate analysis was performed between potential risk factors and mortality followed by multivariate regression analysis to ascertain independent predictors of mortality. Results There were 417 admissions to the ICU during the study period, 89 of whom were excluded because of an absent cTnT value, leaving 328 patients included in the analysis. cTnT was elevated in 85% of patients. ICU mortality was 19% and hospital mortality was 28%. Hospital mortality (%) per cTnT category was: <14 ng/l = 2%; 14 to 38 ng/l = 19%; 39 to 90 ng/l = 26%; 91 to 252 ng/l = 39%; >252 ng/l = 43%. On univariate analysis, cTnT levels, age, ventilation and APACHE II score were signifi cantly associated with mortality. cTnT levels were signifi cant in multivariate regression independent of age and ventilation but did not reach signifi cance (P = 0.06) in a multivariate analysis that included the APACHE II score. Conclusion In 85% of general ICU patients, troponin measured by HS cTnT assay was elevated. cTnT levels were signifi cantly associated with mortality and are predictive of mortality independent of age and mechanical ventilation, but not independently of APACHE II score. There was a high correlation between troponin levels and APACHE II scores. Reference ",

Conclusion ICU and hospital mortality rates were high at 40% and 56% respectively. Increasing age did not correlate with mortality.

There are concerns that the widespread use of antibiotic therapy in the absence of documented infection may lead to selection of drug-resistant organisms [1] . The aim of this study was to review the profi le of pancreatic fl uid isolates in patients with SAP admitted to the ICU. Methods Data were reviewed for 38 patients admitted to the ICU over a 5-year period. We evaluated organisms cultured from pancreatic specimens, as well as the prevalence of drug-resistant organisms in this group of patients. Results Aspirate of pancreatic material for culture was obtained in 55% of patients (n = 21). The mean time to acquisition of samples for culture from admission to ICU was 15.5 days. Fluid was sterile in 67% (n = 14) of initial samples. Gram-positive organisms were cultured from 43% (n = 9) of samples, Gram-negative organisms from 5% (n = 1) and yeasts from 5% (n = 1). Antibiotic therapy was administered in 95% of patients prior to samples being obtained for culture. On review of all samples received from patients (including nonpancreatic specimens), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were isolated in 13 patients. Linezolid-resistant enterococci (LRE) were isolated in six patients, fi ve of whom had VRE isolated prior to the culture of LRE. Extendedspectrum beta-lactamase organisms were isolated in two patients, and carbapenem nonsusceptible Gram-negative organisms in three patients. The mean APACHE II score was 18.5 and overall hospital mortality was 26%. Conclusion In the majority of patients, initial aspirates of pancreatic material were sterile. This may be a result of prior antibiotic usage. Where organisms were cultured from initial aspirates, Gram-positive organisms predominated, possibly as a result of prior anti-Gramnegative antibiotic use. Therefore, in patients with ongoing sepsis who are receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, consideration needs to be given to the empiric treatment of Gram-positive infection, and in particular drug-resistant organisms such as VRE. Local epidemiology should be taken into account. Rationale use of antibiotics, in accordance with best-practice guidelines, may limit development of drug resistance; however, other risk factors for resistance may exist in this group and this would need to be further evaluated.

Nineteen patients (70%) were receiving inotropic infusions at the time of organ availability. The median preoperative MELD score was 12, and elevations in preoperative international normalized ratio were due to warfarin in all but one patient. Liver transplantation immediately preceded cardiac transplantation in 2/27 cases to reduce high-titer donor-specifi c antibodies.

Multivariate analysis showed APACHE II >20 (P = 0.001), fi brinogen <2 (P = 0.019) and D-dimer >1(P = 0.06) are independent predictors of mortality in severe sepsis or septic shock. See Table 1 . Introduction Systemic infl ammation caused by infection or trauma often leads to adverse outcome in critically ill patients. Binding of ligands to the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) activates several pathways, including the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway, which generates infl ammatory cytokines, proteases and oxidative stress. RAGE activation has been suggested to link amplifi cation and perpetuation of infl ammation to subsequent organ damage and adverse outcome in sepsis, acute lung injury and myocardial dysfunction [1] . The soluble receptor, sRAGE, is thought to act as a decoy, thus protecting against further RAGE activation. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear protein that is released during cellular stress and damage. S100A12 is a neutrophil-derived protein that acts as a proinfl ammatory danger signal. Both are ligands for RAGE. We hypothesized that excessive RAGE activation is linked to adverse outcome in critically ill patients and that a diff erent pattern of RAGE activation and infl ammation may be present in patients according to underlying pathology. Methods We measured sRAGE, HMGB1 and S100A12 serum levels upon admission, day 7 and the last day in the ICU in 405 critically ill surgical patients who needed intensive care for at least 7 days and in 69 matched healthy controls. We assessed the relation of these levels with clinical complications and outcome, in comparison with C-reactive protein (CRP) as a routinely measured clinical parameter of infl ammation. Results Upon ICU admission, levels of sRAGE, HMGB1, S100A12 and CRP were higher as compared with healthy levels. HMGB1, S100A12 and CRP remained elevated throughout the ICU stay but sRAGE decreased to levels lower than in healthy volunteers by day 7. sRAGE and CRP showed distinct time profi les during the ICU stay in patients undergoing cardiac versus other surgery and in patients with versus without sepsis upon admission. Elevated sRAGE upon admission, unlike CRP, was associated with need for renal replacement therapy, liver dysfunction, circulatory failure and mortality. Except for mortality, these associations remained in multivariate logistic regression analysis correcting for baseline risk factors. Conclusion Critical illness alters several components of the RAGE axis. Elevated sRAGE levels upon admission to the ICU were associated with adverse outcome, independent of baseline pathology. Reference the endotoxin activity assay (EAA), a newly developed rapid assay of endotoxin. Blood endotoxin levels (EA levels) of 314 patients admitted to our university hospital ICU were measured within 24 hours from admission, and their correlation with disease severity and outcome was examined.",

CXRs in the ICU are frequently obtained routinely for postoperative cardiosurgical patients, despite the fact that the diagnostic and therapeutic effi cacy of these CXRs is now known to be low [1] . Routine CXRs may only be benefi cial for certain indications and the discussion regarding these indications and the safety of abandoning routine CXRs is still continuing [2] . Methods We prospectively included all patients who underwent major cardiac surgery in the year 2012. A direct postoperative CXR was performed only for certain specifi ed indications. An on-demand CXR could be obtained during the postoperative period according to other specifi ed indications. For all patients who did not have a CXR taken before the morning of the fi rst postoperative day, a control CXR was then performed. All CXR fi ndings were noted and classifi ed, including whether or not they led to an intervention. Diagnostic and therapeutic effi cacy values were calculated. Results A total of 1,351 patients were included who mainly underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, valve surgery or a combination of both. Eighteen percent of patients underwent a minimally invasive cardiac surgery. The diagnostic effi cacy for major abnormalities was clearly higher for the postoperative and on-demand CXRs, performed on indication, when compared with the next-morning routine CXR (6.7% and 6.9% vs. 2.9%) (P = 0.002). The therapeutic effi cacy was also clearly higher for the postoperative and on-demand CXRs (2.9% and 4.1%), while the need for intervention after the morning control CXR was now reduced to be minimal (0.6%) (P = 0.002). producing an escalated response to an increasing score are used eff ectively within the Trust, yet mortality is high in patients admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The CURB-65 score may not be an eff ective risk stratifi cation tool for predicting mortality in the older patient nor to guide intensive care admission [1] . Jarvis and colleagues developed an EWS based on laboratory blood tests and used it in conjunction with physiological EWS to eff ectively risk stratify all medical patients [2] . Methods Of 2,158 patients admitted with pneumonia during 12 months from August 2012, data were collected for 1,598 who had received the required blood tests. Data included dates of admission, discharge and death if appropriate, gender, haemoglobin (g/dl), white cell count (10 9 /l), sodium (mmol/l), potassium (mmol/l), urea (mmol/l), creatinine (mmol/l) and albumin (g/l) on admission. A composite EWS was calculated and measured against outcome. Results Of 1,598 patients, 538 died during this admission. It is uncertain whether death was due to pneumonia as only admission diagnosis is recorded but overall mortality was 35%. Analysis of data showed a strongly positive relationship between increasing EWS and increased risk of mortality with a correlation coeffi cient of 0.97. Conclusion Observational results suggest an EWS based on laboratory tests can be used to risk stratify patients with pneumonia and could be used to treat those with higher scores more aggressively earlier in their illness. Further analysis is required to determine whether age is a contributing factor and how this may modify the EWS. We need to determine whether laboratory-based EWS risk stratifi cation can be used in isolation, or whether it contributes suffi ciently to an existing physiological EWS that a combined system would improve outcome in our patients.",

Even if ICUs are considered the safest place to perform NIV, a shortage of intensive beds has lead to NIV application outside the ICU. With appropriate patient selection, treatment-timing choice, adequate monitoring and staff training, NIV application in general wards can allow one to safely treat patients at an early stage with better cost-eff ectiveness [1] . Few data assessing the right tool to evaluate NIV treatment effi cacy are available. Methods We present preliminary data of a prospective observational ongoing study. Sixteen patients undergoing NIV treatment outside the ICU for ARF of any origin were evaluated with LUS at three times: before NIV application (T0), and at 5 minutes (T5) and 60 minutes (T60) of NIV treatment.

Frequency of exposure to patients with suspected pneumothorax, frequency of LUS use, assessment of diagnostic accuracy of LUS for ruling-out or ruling-in pneumothorax and preferences regarding technical aspects were enquired about. Results Eighty-nine physicians responded. Average exposure to pneumothorax cases was 1/week. Fifty-fi ve per cent of respondents used LUS 'always' or 'frequently' . Thirty-four per cent of physicians rated LUS as 'always accurate' , and a further 54% as 'accurate in a majority of cases' in ruling out pneumothorax. Twenty-one per cent rated LUS as 'always accurate' and 69% as 'accurate in a majority of cases' in ruling in pneumothorax. Physicians reporting frequent exposure to pneumothorax patients used LUS in a higher proportion of cases ('high caseload sonographers') and were more confi dent to rule out pneumothorax (Figure 1 ). In total, 16 diff erent combinations of transducers, probe orientations and scanning modes were reported. Linear transducers, sagittal probe-orientation, and B-mode and M-mode scanning were most often selected (38%). Conclusion Physicians' use of LUS in the diagnosis of pneumothorax was modest. Assessment of diagnostic accuracy gave markedly lower scores than reported in clinical trials [1] . Correlation between frequency of exposure, likelihood of LUS usage and confi dence in diagnostic accuracy warrants further research into the nature of the learning curve. Considerable variations regarding technical aspects of LUS refl ect the ambiguity of current recommendations [2] . More research is required to establish the most effi cient way of performing LUS for suspected pneumothorax and eff orts need to be made to promote its use in these scenarios.",

Introduction A semi-upright position (45\u00b0 position) in ventilated patients is recommended to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is one of the fi rst steps in progressive early mobility. We studied ventilated intensive care patients in a semi-upright position compared with a supine position to explore whether there was an improvement of oxygenation and ventilation. Methods We retrospectively studied 60 patients in a mixed medical, surgical, neurological ICU during 2003 and 2007 [1] [2] [3] . In this study the eff ects of 45\u00b0 position on the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) and the end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2 ) were measured. Body position was changed with a Total Care\u00ae bed (Hill-Rom) after results for the supine position (10\u00b0) were obtained. Half an hour after the body position was changed, measurements were taken, which included SpO 2 and ETCO 2 . Conclusion We demonstrated a signifi cant increase in oxygen saturation and a signifi cant decrease in end-tidal CO 2 when the head of the bed was elevated during mechanical ventilation. We believe positional therapy in intensive care patients is very important. The semi-upright position is an easy, eff ective and safe treatment in ICU patients. This position is eff ective in the bundle prevention of VAP, is the fi rst step in progressive early mobility and is also eff ective in oxygenation and ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients. This clinical benefi t of head-of-bed elevation >30\u00b0 must lead to a standard of care in mechanically ventilated patients. Since 2009 the semi-upright position is a standard of care in our hospital.",

Among the patients with similar NIMV application characteristics, the eff ect of age, APACHE II score, infection, bronchospasm (daily respiratory function tests were performed with portable spirometry), heart failure, thyroid dysfunction and physiologic dead space ventilation (VD/VT) on success were evaluated. In statistical analysis, t test, Mann-Whitney U test and regression analysis were used. Introduction Average volume-assured pressure support (AVAPS) has been developed to ensure a more fi xed tidal volume along with the convenience and advantages of pressure support ventilation. In this study we compared the AVAPS with the BIPAP. Methods Approval was obtained from the hospital's ethics committee for the study. Thirty-three patients over 18 years of age with acute respiratory failure as a result of either internal or surgical reasons were included in the study. This study was conducted with the Philips V 60 ventilator, which includes both BIPAP and AVAPS mode. The implementation protocol for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) included, fi rstly, a 2-hour BIPAP application (Period Bi) and then, without interruption, a 2-hour AVAPS application (Period AV). After measuring the basal blood gas analysis, patients were informed of how NIV would be practiced and what function it would have. In BIPAP mode, the ventilator parameters were adjusted as follows; EPAP: 5 to 7 cmH 2 O, IPAP: 15 to 20 cmH 2 O. Patient comfort was analyzed with a scale ranging from 0 to 2 (0: compatible, 1: medium-compatible, 2: noncompatible). During BIPAP ventilation, levels of arterial blood gases (pH, pO 2 , pCO 2 and SPO 2 ), comfort scale and hemodynamic data were recorded at the 30th minute, fi rst hour and second hour. After the patient was monitored for 2 hours in BIPAP mode, the mode was changed to the AVAPS by setting the required rates without removing the mask. EPAP settings were adjusted as follows for AVAPS: 5 to 7 cmH 2 O, Pmin to max: 10 to 25 cmH 2 O, tidal volume: 6 to 8 ml/kg. As in the BIPAP mode, we analyzed and recorded the rates of arterial blood gases, comfort scale and hemodynamic parameters at the 30th minute, fi rst hour and second hour. In case of agitation that prevents NIV, patients were sedated by dexmedetomidine. Results When we analyzed patients according to their body mass indexes (BMI), pH and pCO 2 values of the patients with BMI \u226430 showed a greater improvement at all three measurements in the AVAPS compared with BIPAP (P <0.001). When patient compliance was examined, the number of patients regarded as comfortable in the BIPAP period was 20 (66.7%), but this fi gure was 25 (83.3%) for the AVAPS. Conclusion Patient comfort was higher and need for sedation was lower in AVAPS. According to the results obtained from this study, the AVAPS had positive eff ects on pH, gas variation and patient comfort; therefore, it can be confi dently used in clinical practice.",

We therefore designed a physiological study to evaluate and compare the eff ects of nNAVA15 with nPSV and nNAVA on VASd, EAdipeak, pressurization rate and arterial blood gases (ABGs). Methods Fourteen patients undergoing noninvasive ventilation because of acute respiratory failure underwent three randomized 30-minute trials: nPSV (inspiratory support above positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) \u22658 cmH 2 O, fastest rate of pressurization); nNAVA (NAVA level to achieve a comparable EAdipeak as during nPSV); nNAVA15 (NAVA level at 15 cmH 2 O/\u03bcV and the maximum inspiratory airway pressure (Paw) set at the value corresponding to PEEP + inspiratory support during nPSV). Oxygen inspiratory fraction and PEEP remained unmodifi ed throughout the study period. The last minute of each trial was analyzed. Paw-time products of the initial 200 ms from the onset of ventilator pressurization (PTP200), of the initial 300 and 500 ms from the onset of the EAdi swing indexed to the ideal PTP (PTP300i and PTP500i, respectively), and of the triggering area (PTPt) were computed. ABGs and VASd were assessed at the end of each trial. Conclusion Compared with nPSV and nNAVA, nNAVA15 through a mask reduces VASd, assuring an optimal pressurization rate and triggering performance, without aff ecting the breathing pattern, neural drive and ABGs. Introduction Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) has so far been used in minimally sedated intensive care patients. NAVA has not been applied in patients in the operation room. The eff ect of diff erent sedatives/anesthetics on the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) has not so far been studied. The aim of our study was to compare the eff ect of sevofl urane and propofol on the Edi signal and breathing pattern during sedation and anesthesia and also in combination with remifentanil. Methods A randomized cross-over study comparing sevofl urane and propofol sedation and anesthesia in 10 juvenile pigs. Remifentanil 0.1 \u03bcg/kg/minute was added after a period of anesthetic agent administration. The animals were ventilated with NAVA with fi xed level throughout the study. Respiratory variables were measured for the last 5 minutes of each 15-minute exposure.",

The breathing variability, expressed as the coeffi cient of variation (SD/mean) of the tidal volume (CVvt), was high with both drugs. CVvt was greater during with propofol than with sevofl urane (CVvt 32 vs. 18% during sedation and CVvt 23 vs. 14% during anesthesia). The frequency of sighs was higher with propofol both during sedation (29 vs. 12 sighs/hour) and anesthesia (21 vs. 1 sighs/hour) than with sevofl urane. Conclusion NAVA can be applied during propofol and sevofl urane anesthesia in pigs, with well-preserved Edi and spontaneous breathing. The natural variability is maintained with NAVA even during anesthesia. In contrast to sevofl urane, propofol sedation and anesthesia is associated with a high frequency of sighs and post-sigh apneas, probably due to a centrally induced mechanism. Our data warrant studies of NAVA in humans undergoing anesthesia and surgery when neuromuscular blockade is not required.",

During the plateau phases there was a slight increase in alveolar size at higher plateau pressures (slope of linear regression at plateau 4 mbar: 0.1 %/500 ms for ZEEP group, 0.18%/500 ms for PEEP group; at plateau 8 mbar: 0.42%/500 ms for ZEEP group, 0.565%/500 ms for PEEP group). After the manoeuvres, compliance increased to 137.73% in the ZEEP group and 119.91% in the PEEP group. Conclusion In the healthy lung, once recruited, alveoli stay stable in size over wide pressure ranges. Further recruitment manoeuvres do not lead to further increase of alveolar size, but increase of compliance. During plateau phases, alveolar size increases dependent on pressure. This leads to the assumption that recruitment is not only pressure dependent but also time dependent. References Introduction Lung-protective mechanical ventilation requires positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume (VT) to be chosen with regard to the individual state of the lung. The shape of the intratidal compliance-volume profi les might refl ect the state of the lung (atelectatic, open, overdistended) and could therefore be classifi ed into shape categories that translate into PEEP suggestions [1] . Intratidal resistance-volume profi les might refl ect intratidal opening and collapse of the lung [2] . Using respiratory data from an animal study we suggest a classifi cation into resistance shape categories based on the slope of the R(V) profi les. Methods Fifteen pigs with lavage-induced lung damage were ventilated at two PEEP levels (0 and 12 mbar) and three tidal volumes (8, 12 and 16 ml/kg bodyweight). Compliance (C(V)) and resistance (R(V)) profi les for each individual animal and ventilation setting were calculated from respiratory data using the gliding-SLICE method [3] . C(V) profi les were associated with one of the six suggested shape categories. The dependency of the mean R(V) slope of all animals on the ventilation setting was used as a basis for classifi cation into resistance shape categories. Resistance shape categories were compared with compliance shape categories for each individual animal to test whether similar PEEP suggestions result from both methods.",

Conclusion Protective ventilation with low VT and higher PEEP reduces P. aeruginosa growth in lung tissue, lung edema formation and lung injury in contrast with medium-high VT and lower PEEP ventilation in this porcine pneumonia model. Previously, an oxygenation-based method was shown more related to the CT-measured eff ect of PEEP than lung mechanics [1] , indicating lung aeration is better quantifi ed using V/Q mismatch. Pulmonary shunt and low and high V/Q mismatch can be estimated from varying FIO 2 and measuring ventilation and blood gas contents [2] . Methods Preliminary results in six ARDS patients. CT scans were taken in static conditions at PEEP 5, 45 and 15 to 20 cmH 2 O. V/Q was estimated at 5 and 15 to 20 cmH 2 O as: shunt, low V/Q as alveolar to lung capillary PO 2 diff erence (\u0394AcPO 2 ), high V/Q as alveolar to lung capillary PCO 2 diff erence (\u0394AcPCO 2 ) [2] . Nonaeration, poor aeration, and normal aeration plus hyperinfl ation were calculated from Hounsfi eld units. Aeration and V/Q were compared (Pearson, \u03c1). Results PEEP improved V/Q in four patients, shunt reducing 7 to 42% with no/small increase in \u0394AcPCO 2 . Two deteriorated, with large \u0394AcPCO 2 or shunt increase.

We could prove our hypothesis that ventilation-analogue stimulation was worse for the cellular viability then spontaneousbreathing analogue stimulation. In future, the direct optical tracking of cell damage should allow one to analyse other stimulation profi les as well, and thereby to improve the stimulation profi les and ultimately the ventilation profi le as well. Measurements of dynamic pulmonary shunt fraction could help in assessing the degree of cylic R/D. However, common methods of measuring pulmonary shunt do not allow for dynamic serial measurements during one respiratory cycle. In this study, we measured serial dynamic pulmonary shunt fractions during one breathing cycle and investigated the eff ect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on cyclic R/D in artifi cially ventilated pigs before and after saline washout induced acute lung injury. Methods Pigs (n = 10) were anesthetized and ventilated at a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg and two levels of PEEP (0 and 15 cmH 2 O -conditions: PEEP0; PEEP15). Hemodynamic, respiratory and multiple inert gas analysis by micropore membrane inlet mass spectrometery (MMIMS-MIGET; Oscillogy, USA) measurements were taken at PEEP0 and PEEP15 before and after saline washout. Retention of SF6, measured fi ve times during one breathing cycle, was taken as a refl ection of shunt fraction. MIGET sample acquisition was synchronized by electrical impedance tomography.",

            "text": "We observed dynamic changes in pulmonary shunt fraction, expressed as changes in SF6 retention, within all breathing cycles recorded, before and after induction of ALI. In healthy lungs at PEEP0 there was a decrease in SF retention at the end of inspiration and a return to baseline levels during expiration. In contrast, SF6 retention increased at PEEP0 in ALI during inspiration and decreased during expiration. In healthy pigs ventilated with PEEP15 there was an increase in SF6 retention at the end of inspiration and a return to baseline during expiration similar to the changes observed in pigs with ALI at PEEP0. In ALI at PEEP15, shunt decreased throughout inspiration and returned to baseline levels during expiration. Conclusion Serial dynamic pulmonary shunt measurements during mechanical ventilation showed distinct variations over the respiratory cycle in both healthy and injured lungs. Increasing PEEP from 0 to 15 cmH 2 O altered the patterns of dynamic pulmonary shunt before and after ALI. Thus, serial assessment of dynamic pulmonary shunt fraction by SF6 retention with MMIMS-MIGET could prove useful for optimization of mechanical ventilation in healthy and injured lungs. Quantifying RV function by echocardiography can be challenging due to its shape and position. STE is a relatively new, feasible, sensitive, angle-independent method for describing cardiac deformation (strain) [2] and is particularly useful in analyzing RV function (RV free wall strain, RVfwS), as has been shown in pulmonary hypertension cohorts [3] . Methods Ten pigs, 40 to 90 kg, anaesthetized, fully mechanically ventilated at 6 to 8 mg/kg were subject to stepwise escalating levels of PEEP at 2-minute intervals (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 cmH 2 O). RV images were obtained using intracardiac echocardiography (for optimal framerate and endocardial defi nition) and were analyzed offl ine for FAC and RVfwS (using Velocity Vector Imaging; Siemens). Results Escalating levels of PEEP were strongly associated with signifi cant reductions in mean blood pressure (R 2 = 0.8, P <0.0001), FAC (R 2 = 0.8, P <0.0001) and RVfwS (R 2 = 0.9, P <0.001). Paired t tests indicated signifi cant reductions in RVfwS with each step increase in PEEP. FAC only showed signifi cant deterioration at 15 cmH 2 O PEEP. Signifi cant hypotension (a decrease of more than 20 mmHg) occurred after 10 cmH 2 O PEEP. RVfwS decreased by a larger extent and earlier than FAC and mean blood pressure with increasing levels of PEEP. Conclusion RVfwS measured by STE is a sensitive method for determining RV dysfunction induced by PEEP. RVfwS displays a stronger association, greater deterioration and earlier reduction than FAC and mean blood pressure with escalating levels of PEEP. This potentially has interesting implications for the role of STE in managing PEEP levels in critically ill patients with acute lung injury.",

            "text": "Introduction During mechanical ventilation some of the energy delivered to the respiratory system (RS) is dissipated within it, while some is recovered during expiration. The amount of unrecovered energy represents mechanical work done on the RS by the ventilator and may be related to the development of ventilatory-induced lung injury (VILI). The unrecovered energy is measured as the hysteresis area of the pressure-volume (PV) curve in static and dynamic conditions. We explored how and where the energy is dissipated inside the RS. Methods In fi ve piglets (weight 21 \u00b1 2 kg) under general anesthesia, we recorded PV curves to quantify dynamic dissipated energy (DE) at increasing tidal volume (TV) (150, 300, 450, 600, 750, 900) and at increasing respiratory rate (RR) (3, 6, 9, 12, 15) . We then recorded PV curves for the same TV infl ated with a super-syringe (100 ml), to quantify static DE. We also quantifi ed airway DE connecting the postmortem isolated tracheobronchial tree to the ventilator and recording PV curves at the respiratory setting previously described. Introduction CT-scan quantitative analysis (qCT) represents the gold standard to assess lung aeration and recruitment in ARDS patients. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has been proposed as a bedside nonirradiating alternative to assess lung recruitability, identifying patients who may benefi t from higher PEEP levels. We compared the two methods in the assessment of PEEP-induced lung aeration changes. Methods LUS and whole-lung CT scan were performed on ARDS sedated, paralyzed, mechanically ventilated patients at PEEP 5 and 15 cmH 2 O. LUS was performed considering six areas for each lung, with a comprehensive scan of the intercostal spaces in each area. We assigned to each area a score of aeration [1] : 0 (normal lung), 1 (\u22653 noncoalescent B-lines), 2 (\u22653 coalescent B-lines), 3 (consolidation). A cumulative LUS score (LUSS, ranging from 0 to 36 for the two lungs) was obtained as sum of all areas' individual scores, each area's score being the average of all pertaining LUS fi ndings. LUS recruiters upon PEEP increase from 5 to 15 cmH 2 O were defi ned by the switch of at least three areas to well aerated (area score 0). LUS-based assessment of lung aeration and lung recruitability was compared with qCT fi ndings. corresponded to 34 \u00b1 13% of nonaerated tissue at qCT; LUSS >20 (n = 6) to 48 \u00b1 18% (P <0.05). A good linear correlation was found between reduction at LUS of consolidated areas (area score 3) versus reduction of qCT nonaerated volume (R 2 = 0.66), and between reduction at LUS of poorly aerated areas (area score 1 to 2) versus reduction of qCT poorly aerated volume (R 2 = 0.74). Change at LUS of at least three areas to well aerated (LUS recruiters, n = 4) corresponded to a qCT increase in well-aerated lung volume of 788 \u00b1 262 g versus 431 \u00b1 35 g in the LUS nonrecruiter group (n = 3) (P <0.05). Conclusion These preliminary data suggest that LUS could be an accurate tool to assess lung aeration and recruitment at the bedside, avoiding the risks and workload related to the use of CT scan.

The rabbits were randomized to control (n = 5), controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) (n = 5), pressure support ventilation (PSV) (n = 5), or CMV or PSV with LPS-induced endotoxemia (CMV-LPS and PSV-LPS respectively) (n = 5 for each). The endotoxemia was induced by LPS injection in the CMV-LPS and PSV-LPS groups. Rabbits were anesthetized and ventilated for 24 hours, except for the control (30 minutes). A catheter able to detect the electrical activity of the diaphragm was placed to evaluate the diaphragm contractility at baseline and after 6, 12 and 24 hours. After 24 hours, we evaluated: the diaphragm microcirculation assessed by a sidestream dark-fi eld videomicroscopy; the mitochondria membrane potential; the lipid accumulation; and the diaphragm muscular fi ber structure. Results In endotoxemic animals, after 24 hours, the diaphragm contractility and fi ber structure, the microcirculation, mitochondrial membrane potential and lipid accumulation were severely compromised, but not in the CMV and PSV groups. Moreover, a slight but signifi cant increase of lipid accumulation was observed in the CMV and PSV groups in comparison with control (P <0.05). Conclusion In endotoxemic rabbits, the impaired microcirculation resulted in an increased lipid accumulation and in a disturbance of the mitochondria membrane potential and contractility of the diaphragm. No microvascular alterations have been observed in ventilated non-endotoxemic animals. Moreover, the diaphragm contractility dysfunction was more pronounced in endotoxemic animals. References Conclusion This study adds to the literature on the use of HFOV in H1N1 patients. We managed to replicate some of the existing evidence in respect to the population age [1, 2] and the incidence of mortality. Whilst P/F ratios improved on initiation of HFOV, these patients subsequently had long critical care and hospital stays. There is uncertainty regarding the use of HFOV in ARDS, but it may be a valuable treatment for H1N1 patients. The ventilation strategies employed and the subsequent consequences for H1N1 patients require further evaluation.",

In six animals, expiratory fl ow was linearized via FLEX. PEEP was set to achieve similar mean airway pressure in the control group (n = 6) and in the FLEX group (n = 6). Using EIT, the local distribution of ventilation was measured and alveolar derecruitment during the no-fl ow phase in late expiration was quantifi ed. Results During ventilation with FLEX the no-fl ow phase in late expiration was reduced by 50% compared with passive expiration. Derecruitment during the no-fl ow phase was clearly reduced by FLEX compared with VCV. Furthermore, intratidal ventilation was more homogeneously distributed during ventilation with FLEX compared with conventional passive expiration. Conclusion In comparison with conventional VCV with passive expiration, the no-fl ow phase in late expiration is reduced and so is the time the lung persists on the lowest pressure level (PEEP) during the breath. The reduced low-pressure time is associated with reduced endtidal derecruitment. In a lung mechanically stabilized and recruited by sustained airway pressure throughout the expiration phase, the distribution of ventilation is more homogeneous. These mechanisms of alveolar recruitment maintenance can explain the lung-protective eff ects of FLEX.",

We aimed to validate these fi ndings in a multicentre study. Methods We conducted a prospective, multicentre observational study of 167 patients with clinically suspected VAP from 12 ICUs across the UK.

There was a signifi cant increase in paO 2 (13.6 \u00b1 2.35 kPa, P = 0.01) and decrease in paCO 2 (4.82 \u00b1 1.27 kPa, P = 0.02) in the chair group at 1 hour after sitting out in the chair when compared with baseline (10.9 \u00b1 2.44 kPa; 5.41 \u00b1 1.32 kPa). Also there was a signifi cant increase in tidal volume in the chair group after 1 minute of sitting out (403 \u00b1 118 ml) compared with baseline (314 \u00b1 105 ml). There was no diff erence in the electric bed group for all physiological parameters. The chair group had a better CPAX score on discharge from intensive care (chair group 24; electric bed group 13) and on discharge from the hospital (chair group 39; electric bed group 16). There were no adverse cardiovascular responses to either position. Conclusion Sitting suitable critically ill patients out into a chair is safe and can signifi cantly improve the arterial blood gas measurement and the tidal volume when compared with sitting a patient into the sitting position in an electric bed. Reference Introduction Sputum is essential for the protection of the respiratory tract but also plays a signifi cant role in the pathophysiology of lung disease [1] . This is evident in critical care where high sputum loads contribute to respiratory failure [2] . The quantity of sputum produced by a patient can impact on key decisions such as weaning, extubation and discharge. We undertook a survey to establish whether there was a consensus on how we quantify sputum on our intensive therapy unit (ITU). Methods We conducted a multidisciplinary team questionnaire of our 28-bed tertiary ITU. Staff were asked how they quantifi ed sputum load in intubated patients. They were also asked to rate statements on a fi ve-point scale pertaining to sputum characteristics. The results were analysed in Excel 2010. Results One hundred members of staff completed the sputum production in intensive therapy (SPIT) questionnaire (21% doctors, 71% nurses, 8% physiotherapists). Sputum load was deemed to be important or essential by more than 95% of respondents when making decisions to extubate or decanulate. The quantifi cation of sputum was inconsistent: 39% of respondents counted the frequency of suctioning, 24% measured the quantity of sputum in the suction tubing, whereas 25% used another method. An eff ective cough, consistency and colour were felt to be more important features of sputum than blood staining. Conclusion Our results showed a very high level of agreement on the importance of knowing sputum load for decisions to extubate, decanulate or discharge from the ITU. In contrast, there was little consensus on how we should quantify sputum load in ventilated patients. This lack of standard approach may contribute to uncertainty in the clinical decision-making process. We have developed an objective sputum scoring system. Components identifi ed as important by our survey such as suction frequency, sputum consistency and colour are included. We have recognised the benefi ts of the standardised Bristol stool chart to facilitate communication and believe this can be achieved with sputum load in ventilated patients.",

We aimed to study the outcomes of patients with acute respiratory failure of mixed aetiology treated with NIV in our critical care unit and compare fi ndings with those already published. Methods Data were collected retrospectively on patients admitted to our critical care unit with acute respiratory failure requiring NIV over a 3-year period using the Metavision electronic patient record system. Patients with a primary surgical problem and those who received continuous positive airway pressure as a primary intervention were excluded. We recorded: primary respiratory diagnosis causing respiratory failure; patient demographics; serial arterial blood gas results; success of NIV as defi ned by the British Thoracic Society (BTS) [4] ; and mortality statistics. Conclusion NIV is used to treat acute respiratory failure due to a wide range of aetiologies in our unit with comparable mortality rates to large published series [1, 2, 5] .

Recently some studies have reported that NHF improves oxygenation and reduces respiratory rate. However, the usefulness of NHF in the general surgical ICU has not been fully determined. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in our general surgical ICU to investigate the eff ect of NHF on respiratory parameters in patients with postoperative respiratory failure. Patients who were admitted to the ICU for postoperative respiratory failure (defi ned as oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry <96% and/or respiratory rate>24 beats/minute while receiving more than 6 l/ minute oxygen through a facemask) were eligible in this study. Pre and 1 and 6 hours after NHF treatment, we collected PaO 2 , PaCO 2 , respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood pressure. Introduction Use of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in trauma casualties is limited by concerns regarding hemorrhage, particularly in the presence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We report usage of ECMO/ interventional lung assist (iLA) as salvage therapy in 13 trauma patients. A high-fl ow technique without anticoagulation was used in cases with coagulopathy or severe TBI. Methods Data were collected from all adult trauma cases referred to one center for ECMO/iLA treatment due to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. Thirteen consecutives cases are reported. The type of assistance was chosen based on a fl owchart. Type of study: therapeutic, level of evidence IV. We analyzed patient data, injury data, blood gases before connection, methods of assistance, coagulation study, complications, survival and neurological outcome. Results Thirteen casualties had an average Injury Severity Score of 50.3 \u00b1 10.5 (age 27.7 \u00b1 8.6 years, 69.2% male) and were supported 9.9 \u00b1 4.8 days on ECMO (n = 7) and 7.16 \u00b1 5.9 days on iLA (n = 6). All suff ered severe chest injuries, including one cardiac perforation. Most were coagulopathic prior to initiation of ECMO/iLA support. Among the seven patients with TBI, four had active intracranial hemorrhage. Only 30% of the patients received continuous anticoagulation during the fi rst 24 hours of support without clotting of the system or diagnosis of a thromboembolic event. Complications directly related to support therapy were not lethal; these included hemorrhage from a cannulation site (n = 1), accidental removal of a cannula (n = 1) and pressure sores (n = 3). Deaths occurred due to septic (n = 3) and cardiogenic shock (n = 1). Survival rates were 57 and 83% on ECMO and iLA, respectively. Follow-up of survivors detected no neurological deterioration. Conclusion ECMO/iLA therapy can be used as rescue therapy in adult trauma cases with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, even in the presence of coagulopathy, bleeding and/or brain injury. The benefi ts of oxygenation and circulatory support must be weighed individually against the risk of hemorrhage. Further research should determine whether ECMO therapy also confers survival benefi t. Introduction While complement protein defi ciencies are associated with severe and recurrent pulmonary infections, excessive complement activation plays a role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. We hypothesized that inhibition of the complement system by repetitive treatment with nebulized plasma-derived human C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) reduces pulmonary complement activation and subsequently attenuates lung injury and lung infl ammation in a model of severe Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. Methods Thirty-two male rats were intratracheally challenged with S. pneumoniae to induce pneumonia. Rats were repeatedly exposed to nebulized C1-INH or saline, 30 minutes before induction of pneumonia and every 6 hours thereafter. Rats were sacrifi ced 20 or 40 hours after inoculation to investigate early and late eff ects. BALF and lung tissue were obtained for measuring levels of complement activation (C4b/c in BALF), lung injury (total protein levels in BALF), and infl ammation (IL-6 levels in lung tissue). Results Pneumonia was characterized by bilateral macroscopic infi ltrates, bacterial outgrowth in the lung and clinical signs of illness. Pneumonia was associated with pulmonary complement activation. In rats treated with nebulized C1-INH, a functional fraction of C1-INH was detectable in BALF. However, C1-INH treatment did not aff ect Introduction Management of acute respiratory diseases must avoid ventilator-induced lung injuries along with the rise of PaCO 2 and respiratory acidosis [1] . Eff orts are made to fi nd devices assisting protective ventilation and able to remove arterial CO 2 and correct acidosis [2] . An extracorporeal CO 2 removal device driven by the widely used Prismafl ex\u00ae platform called PrismaLung\u00ae was tested in vivo. Methods Five hypercapnic ventilated pigs were equipped with the PrismaLung\u00ae system designed to remove CO 2 from the bloodstream through a decarboxylation membrane mounted on a renal replacement device without any hemofi lter. Experiments examined the potential for blood decarboxylation by gas-exchanger membrane with diff erent sets of parameters (blood fl ow rate: 200, 300 and 400 ml/minute, sweep gas fl ow: 2, 5, 10 and 50 l/minute, FiO 2 : 21 and 100%). Statistical analysis was performed with the Student t test.",

Carbia and pH of animals were signifi cantly modifi ed after 10 minutes Introduction Referral for ECMO has been demonstrated to reduce mortality in severe hypoxic respiratory failure [1] [2] [3] . The numbers of patients that undergo ECMO is still small and the service depends on timely referral from regional ICUs. There is evidence that intensivists' views on the role of ECMO are mixed [4] . The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are variations in the geographical distribution of patients that receive ECMO. Methods NHS England provided the home primary care trust (PCT) of all adult patients referred for ECMO for potentially reversible respiratory failure from 2008 to 2012. The referrals from each PCT were indexed to the population of each area to produce a referral rate per 1,000,000 people. Results See Figure 1 . ECMO services have expanded rapidly in the last 5 years in England following the publication of evidence for its effi cacy and concerns regarding an infl uenza pandemic. The referral rates for ECMO for severe hypoxic respiratory failure vary greatly around the country from 88 per 1,000,000 population in Leicester City to no referrals in 32 PCTs. Possible explanations could include: the distributions of swine fl u around the country, referring doctors' beliefs about the effi cacy of ECMO, local access to high-frequency oscillation ventilation and possible reluctance of teaching hospitals to refer to specialist centres. Further investigation to account for this variation appears indicated. Conclusion The referral rates for ECMO vary greatly around the country. References Introduction Using micro-computed tomography (MicroCT), we assessed the eff ectiveness of a cleaning closed-suctioning system (CSS) to remove secretions from the endotracheal tube (ETT) lumen. Biofi lm growing within the ETT, soon after intubation, increases the patient's risk to develop ventilator-associated pneumonia, and new cleaning devices have been designed to keep the ETT clean from secretions [1] .",

Reference Introduction Today's healthcare environment has forced providers to constantly evaluate the materials used, and to fi nd less expensive alternatives. Recently, low-cost endotracheal tubes (ETTs) have been introduced to the market. The aim of this study was to test these tubes (Portex AirCare and Cardinal Health ETT) compared with endotracheal tubes with known performance (Hi-Lo Covidient pre ISO standard and Taper-Guard Covidient, post ISO standard). Methods We used the required test setups according to the ISO standard for cuff sealing performance. The tubes were tested versus each other in size 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0 mm.

The standard deviation leak rate for AirCare was large, suggesting varying seal performance between tubes from various lots. The kink test showed no diff erence among tubes. Conclusion Although tubes look the same there may be diff erences in performance. This study demonstrated that the new cheaper ETTs had greater cuff leak compared with the two tubes used for comparison. We can only speculate whether diff erences found in this study is a result of cost cutting. However, the great variability in sealing performance between ETTs of the same size from diff erent lots would indicate that manufacturing controls may be less stringent. Although we cannot demonstrate that the higher incidence of leak will result in adverse patient outcomes, one can surmise that the possibility exists. Thus, selection of endotracheal tubes should not be based on purchase price alone but should take into account documented performance in standardized tests. Methods A retrospective review was performed using data in the last 5 years. All OPs were from the ICU of our university hospital. Only OPs who underwent a PDT were selected with BMI >30 kg/m 2 . All OPs needed prolonged mechanical ventilation. A total of 67 OPs were identifi ed, with 60 PDTs placed using the Ciaglia Blue Rhino (CBR) Introducer Kit and seven PDTs with the UniPerc PDT Kit. All PDTs were performed by dedicated staff including residents. Valuation of clinical anatomical and physio-pathological features of the OPs and US scan of the neck came before the procedure. At the beginning of the procedure we placed a 5 mm ID orotracheal tube by tube exchange with video-FBS assistance, as already described [3] . An 8 to 9 mm ID wire-reinforced silicone tracheostomy tube (rTT) with adjustable fl ange was chosen instead of a standard PVC or silastic TT (sTT) in all OPs treated with CBR because of the anatomical particularities of OPs and because of external traction by the weight of the tubing attached to the TT. An extralong TT (eTT) was chosen because the pretracheal tissue was too thick for a regular-sized TT in 16 OPs with BMI >40 kg/m 2 treated with CBR.

We had only minor complications (<50 ml bleeding: 3%; ring fracture: 2%; diffi cult insertion: 21% only with CBR rTT because of the step between the tip of the rTT and its introducer). UniPerc eTT placement has always been easy. Conclusion In our experience, the data do not support what previous studies have shown suggesting increased risk of complication in OPs [1, 2] . We know that the sTT could not be eff ective in OPs. The use of US, video-FBS assistance [3] , and rTT with an adjustable fl ange allows a safe and eff ective adjustment to anatomical OP particularities, avoiding collected risks. References Introduction High-fl ow oxygen therapy (HFOT) delivered through nasal cannulas can improve oxygenation as compared with low-fl ow oxygen devices. It has been shown that nasal HFOT can generate a positive airway pressure, which increases linearly with the gas fl ow rate. Data on the use of HFOT delivered through a tracheostomy are scarce. The aim of the present randomized, controlled, cross-over trial was to assess the eff ects of HFOT delivered through a tracheostomy on arterial blood gases and endotracheal pressure in critically ill patients. Methods Tracheostomized patients underwent HFOT with three gas fl ow rates (10 l/minute, 30 l/minute and 50 l/minute), randomly applied for 20-minute periods. At the end of each period, arterial blood gases, respiratory rate, and endotracheal pressure (Ptrach) were measured. Ptrach was recorded over the last 3 minutes of each study period: the maximum expiratory pressure (MEPtrach) and mean expiratory pressure were measured and averaged for all respiratory cycles during 1-minute recording with stable breathing. FiO 2 was kept constant during the whole study.",

Increasing the gas fl ow rate from 10 l/minute to 30 l/minute was associated with an increase in PaO 2 /FiO 2 that did not improve further when 50 l/minute was used (259 \u00b1 66, 317 \u00b1 79, and 325 \u00b1 76, respectively, P <0.001). The same trend was observed with PaO 2 (89 \u00b1 19 mmHg, 109 \u00b1 26 mmHg, and 113 \u00b1 29 mmHg, respectively, P <0.001) and SaO 2 (96 \u00b1 3%, 98 \u00b1 2%, 98 \u00b1 2%, respectively, P <0.001).

Changes in PaO 2 /FiO 2 were not correlated with changes in expiratory pressures. Conclusion When HFOT is used through a tracheostomy at increasing gas fl ow rate, oxygenation increases up to 30 l/minute while CO 2 clearance and the respiratory rate do not vary. Tracheal expiratory pressure increases with fl ow, but changes are small and probably of limited clinical relevance. Changes in oxygenation are not related to the variations of tracheal expiratory pressure. HFOT through a tracheostomy has diff erent eff ects from when a nasal interface is used.",

            "text": "The 4th National Audit project, conducted by the Royal College of Anaesthetists in 2011, reviewed major airway complications in the UK [1] . It highlighted tracheostomy tube displacement as a signifi cant risk in critical care patients. Prior to 2011, at the Royal London Hospital ICU, the Tracoe Twist (marketed by Kapitex) was primarily used as the default choice of tracheostomy tube. However, over a 5-year period, there were a signifi cant number of critical incidents related to tracheostomy tube displacement or blockage. On investigation of these incidents, root-cause analysis identifi ed inadequate length of the Tracoe Twist as a major contributing factor. As a consequence of this, there was also an increasing requirement for the use of adjustable fl ange tubes. This was particularly apparent in obese patients. Our objective was to develop a new tracheostomy tube that would reduce the number of incidents related to inadequate length. An additional aim was to maximise the inner diameter for a given external diameter, thus reducing airway resistance and potentially aiding weaning. Methods We formed a consultation committee, consisting of consultants in critical care, a consultant surgeon and a consultant anaesthetist with a specialist interest in head and neck anaesthesia and tracheostomy care. We collaborated with the Kapitex design team to develop a new tracheostomy tube which addressed some of the perceived defi cits of existing devices.",

We examined the diff erences in the ability to speak, the duration of the weaning period, the occurrence of delirium and the frequency of tracheal suctioning. We performed a single-centre retrospective and prospective observational study in a 22-bed mixed ICU during 1 year. Data were collected using the patient data management system. Baseline criteria were age, gender, APACHE IV score, ICU length of stay and duration of MV before placement of the tracheostomy. Results Ten patients were included, fi ve in the BiPAP group and fi ve in the spontaneous group. There were no signifi cant diff erences in the baseline criteria. On the second day after tracheostomy, three out of fi ve patients in the BiPAP group were able to speak compared with one in the spontaneous method group. A diff erence in speaking ability remained until day 9 (see Figure 1 ). At fi rst time of speaking, the BiPAP group had higher PEEP level (10 vs. 7.5 cmH 2 O) and higher SOFA score (6.2 vs. 4.6) compared with the spontaneous group. There was no signifi cant diff erence in delirium, duration of weaning and tracheal suctioning between both groups. Conclusion Cuff -defl ated MV in ICU patients enables speaking during ventilator dependence. With this technique the ability to speak started in an earlier phase of weaning compared with weaning with spontaneous breathing trials and a speaking valve. References ",

Routine follow-up is usually available, but cover may only be available during the day. Patients may go to a specialist ward with trained nurses but this is not always the case. Patients are often discharged to wards with their tracheostomy cuff up, raising major safety issues if their tracheostomy tubes block and nurses are not trained for such emergencies.

Following these guidelines, we asked: how are adult tracheostomy patients managed post discharge from the intensive care/high dependence unit (ICU/HDU) throughout the UK?

Out of these, 44% have a tracheostomy weaning protocol, 69% initiate weaning whilst the patient is mechanically ventilated, and 92% use a speaking valve in their weaning process. Also, 87% allow tracheostomy patients to have oral nutritional intake and in 59% of these the decision involves speech and language therapy. Post ICU/ HDU, 67% of units discharge to specialised wards, 22% to nonspecialised wards, 4% to dedicated step-down units and 6% do not step down their tracheostomy patients. A critical care outreach team reviews the patients in 73% of the hospitals surveyed. Furthermore, only 11% of the hospitals have a consultant lead tracheostomy ward round and 17% have a tracheostomy multidisciplinary team (MDT). Also within these hospitals, 57% have their own tracheostomy safety guidelines and 70% have emergency tracheostomy management protocols. On the wards: 34% have tracheostomy bed-head information signs, 93% have emergency bed-side tracheostomy equipment, 89% have a tracheostomy training programme, and 50% have a MDT approach to decannulation. Conclusion There is a wide variation in post-ICU/HDU management of tracheostomy patients throughout the UK. Although there are well established UK national guidelines for the management of tracheostomy patients, outside the ICU/HDU environment there is a lack of full implementation of the NTSP recommendations, increasing the risk of tracheostomy-related morbidity and mortality.",

From these responses, the types of patients receiving SSD are summarised in Table 1 . One hundred per cent of units used intermittent SSD. Seventyone per cent of respondents reported that SSD tubes were stored only on their ICU, with 26% reporting availability in acute areas and the rest hospital wide.

Overall, 83% of those surveyed thought SSD was benefi cial in the prevention of VAP. Conclusion Despite specifi c recommendations from the UK Department of Health [2] , only about one-half of respondents work in ICUs where SSD has been adopted. Most studies show benefi t in patients expected to be ventilated for greater than 72 hours [1] , but most units used SSD in all intubated patients. The reintubation rate to facilitate SSD was also reasonably high, despite a lack of evidence to support this practice. In the vast majority of hospitals, SSD endotracheal tubes are stored only on the ICU and so the need for reintubation may result from a lack of available appropriate tubes at the point of fi rst intubation.",

The pulmonary renin-angiotensin system (RAS), with a lung-protective (angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2-angiotensin (Ang)-1,7-Mas receptor) axis and a lung-injurious (ACE-Ang II-Ang II receptor (AT1)) axis, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARDS and changes with age. We hypothesized that injurious ventilation has an age-dependent eff ect on the pulmonary RAS in LPS-challenged rats that is associated with increased lung injury. Methods Infant (~1/2 month), juvenile (~1 month), adult (~4 months) and older (~19 months) Wistar rats were challenged with intratracheal LPS and injurious ventilation using tidal volumes of 15 ml/kg for 4 hours. Lung injury was assessed by wet-to-dry ratio and changes in P/F ratio. Levels of infl ammatory mediators were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid; mRNA expression of key genes of the pulmonary RAS was determined in lung homogenates. Results LPS-challenged and ventilated older rats showed higher mortality, larger change in wet-to-dry ratio and larger decline in P/F ratio, compared with other age groups. Increases in neutrophil infl ux and infl ammatory mediators were age dependent, with higher levels with increasing age. Compared with controls, ventilated LPSchallenged rats showed a decrease in mRNA expression of ACE, ACE2, AT-1 and Mas receptor in all age groups, except for infants. The relative decrease in the mRNA expression of the Mas receptor was most extensive in older rats, thereby shifting the balance towards the lung injurious axis in this age group. Conclusion The eff ects of injurious ventilation on lung injury are age dependent in a model of LPS-challenged rats, which is associated with a more pronounced imbalance of the pulmonary RAS at the expense of the lung-protective axis with increasing age.

Reference Introduction Two recent RCTs (OSCAR and OSCILLATE [1, 2] ) showed that high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) had no positive impact on mortality. We present our experience over 5 years. Methods Adult ARDS patients who received HFOV from 2008 to 2012 were included. Demographics, illness severity and outcomes were collected retrospectively. Results A total of 118 patients were included; 56.8% were male, mean age was 54.8 years. RRT use was 45% during admission. Vasoactive agent use and neuromuscular blockade infusion rate was 81.9 and 29.7% pre HFOV respectively. The 28-day and 6-month mortality was 61.9 and 70.3%. A total of 60.1% had less than 48 hours conventional ventilation (CV) pre HFOV. The 6-month mortality was 64.8% for this group. Patients who had over 48 hours CV pre HFOV had a 6-month mortality of 76.6%. See Table 1 . Conclusion Mortality rates were higher than in recent trials [1, 2] . Our patients represent a more critically unwell group with lower PF ratios pre HFOV and high vasoactive and RRT use. HFOV may still have a role in the treatment of these very sick patients with treatment refractory to conventional ventilation.",

However, there is a signifi cant bacterial colonisation rate of the arterial lines sampled. Three arterial lines (6.25%) grew organisms that could represent an important potential source of ongoing bacteraemia. There is evidence to suggest that the risk of infection and colonisation of arterial lines may be similar to that of central lines [1] . Further prospective work is needed to assess the impact of catheter care bundles on colonisation and infection rates of arterial lines in the ICU. Introduction Central venous catheters (CVCs) are essential for the delivery of medications and fl uids in the ICU patient; however, they carry a substantial infection risk. Evidence from a collaborative, cohort study suggests bundled interventions can provide a sustained decrease in infection [1] . Methods Since December 2009, data have been collected daily on the number of patients with one or more CVC. All positive blood cultures are reviewed monthly against predefi ned criteria to judge whether these are genuine bacteraemic episodes and thus classifi ed as laboratory-confi rmed bloodstream infections. A monthly rate for CR-BSI per 1,000 dwell-days is calculated from these data. Since July 2010, a number of interventions aimed at reducing CR-BSI have been introduced to the ICU. Results Data are presented on 15,644 CVC dwell-days over 47 months. Table 1 presents data for three full years and one part year* (January to November 2013). Despite an increase in bed-days per year, there has been a sustained reduction in infection rates and a reduction in dwell-days. Conclusion CR-BSI rates of 1.5/1,000 dwell-days in the fi rst year were similar to the post-intervention rate of 1.4 in the Pronovost study [1] . Subsequent rates have reduced, suggesting we are outperforming the secular trend [2] . The proportion of dwell-days to bed-days was reduced, which may suggest a reduction in duration and/or quantity of CVC placements.",

Cluster analysis based on PFGE of the 90 isolates showed 71 unique types, some of which were less than 70% similar, suggesting a genotypically variable population. Isolates that have identical pulsotypes usually were derived from the same patient (as in the case of 11 isolates) or were isolated from diff erent patients of the same NICU in the same period of time (in the case of seven isolates). The location of the NICU and the site of the isolation did not appear to have a correlation in the cluster analysis Conclusion Unfortunately, the presented data indicate that antibiotic prophylaxis in the presence of symptoms such as chorioamnionitis and PROM did not help to reduce the risk of ECO infection in the group of examined infants. In addition, multivariate analysis demonstrated only one signifi cant risk factor for ECO infection among infants with a birth weight <1,500 g; that is, the impact of the NICU. Epidemiology of ECO infections clearly indicated that observed cases of infections have no connection with the horizontal transmission (thus no proof of a link between the observed ECO infections with possible negligence in hand hygiene or excessive congestion on NICUs). This is confi rmed by the fact that no epidemic clones were observed (DEC-2011/01/D/ N27/00104). Introduction Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in ICU patients are related to intubation, mechanical ventilation, and central venous and/ or urinary catheters. The incidence of HAI is too high, and antibiotic strategies suff er from resistance to the common classes of antibacterial agents [1] . Methods A complex program including staff teaching on the basic approaches of hand hygiene, microbiological passport of the ICU departments, and detection of the sources of the pathogens polluting the treatment area of the ICU was implemented at the Lugansk Regional Clinical Hospital. The incidence of the HAI was studied in polytrauma patients in 1999 to 2003 (before the implementation of the program) and in 2008 to 2012 (after its implementation).",

Urinary infections occurred in 51.9% of patients. Surgical site infections were found in 32.8% of the patients. Combination of the infections was detected in 33.8% of patients. The incidence of the multiple-drug-resistant bacterial colonies was 5.8%. In contrast, recent data obtained after the implementation of the program of the infection control showed that the respiratory infections occurred in 29.3% of the patients, catheter-related urinary tract infections were detected in 32.8%, and surgical site infections were detected in 8.6% of the polytrauma patients. On the other hand, the incidence of the multiple-drug-resistant bacterial colonies increased signifi cantly up to 14.2% (P <0.001). Other types of HAI changed nonsignifi cantly. Conclusion In the era of the total antibacterial resistance, the education strategies and organization approaches (for example, infection control, antibiotic susceptibility, hand hygiene, and so forth) become more potent and eff ective than pharmacology innovations. Polytrauma patients, as one of the most severe categories suff ering from the HAI, demand a high level of compliance of the infection control approaches from the side of doctors as well as staff of and visitors to ICUs. Reference Introduction The use of contact precautions is recommended to reduce the transmission of these pathogens. However, there is little research regarding the relationship between the rate of patients with culturepositive fi ndings for Acinetobacter baumannii and the consumption of hand disinfectant. The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate trends in nosocomial bacterial detection, including A. baumannii, and the use of hand disinfectant in our ICU. Methods A single-center, retrospective, observational study was carried out. The results of all cultures (sputum, urine, blood, and so forth) were used to examine trends in the detection of microbiology in our ICU over No patients with culture-positive fi ndings for multidrug-resistant A. baumannii were identifi ed in this study. The rates of patients with culture-positive fi ndings for multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0\u2030 vs. 0.05\u2030 per 1,000 patient-days, P = 0.99) and P. aeruginosa (6.96\u2030 vs. 7.21\u2030 per 1,000 patient-days, P = 0.7) were not signifi cantly diff erent between the early period group and the late period group. The rates of patients with culture-positive fi ndings for MRSA (6.96\u2030 vs. 8.94\u2030 per 1,000 patient-days, P <0.05) and A. baumannii (4.98\u2030 vs. 6.51\u2030 per 1,000 patient-days, P <0.05) were signifi cantly higher in the late period group than in the early period group. Observational studies reported an association with worse clinical outcomes [1] but the eff ect of antifungal therapy in these patients remains unclear. We designed this pilot study to assess the feasibility of a larger trial and to evaluate infl ammatory profi les and clinical outcomes in these patients.",

Recruitment was halted before the end of the study because of diffi culty in recruiting patients. Markers of infl ammation and all clinical outcomes were comparable between placebo and antifungal treatment groups at baseline and overtime. At baseline, TNF\u03b1 levels were higher in the VAP with Candida compared with the observational group (mean \u00b1 SD) ( [1] . Interindividual variability in PK parameters was ascribed to an exponential model according to the equation: \u03b8j = \u03b8p \u00d7 exp(nj), where \u03b8j is the estimate for a pharmacokinetic parameter in the jth patient, \u03b8p is the typical population PK parameter value (ka, CL/F, V/F), and n is a random variable from a normal distribution with zero mean and variance \u03c9 2 . Residual variability was estimated using additive and additive-proportional error models; Cij = Cj + \u03b5add and Cij = Cj(1 + \u03b5p) + \u03b5add, where Cij and Cj are observed-predicted concentrations for the jth patient at time i, respectively, and \u03b5 is the error, a random variable with a normal distribution with zero mean and variance \u03c3 2 . Bayesian estimates were obtained and the pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, Tmax and AUC0-24 hours were calculated. Results Cmax of PZA was above the recommended concentration (>20 mg/l). For RIF the Cmax was below the recommended level (>8 mg/l), and the Cmax of INH was below the recommended levels (>3 mg/l). See Table 1 . Conclusion Large interindividual pharmacokinetic variability and concentrations below the recommended levels for RIF and ISO. We need to monitor drugs and to re-evaluate the doses. Introduction Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) is the most often isolated species of coagulase-negative staphylococci, which are recognized as one of the main causes of ICU infections [1] . In this study we aimed to study the resistance profi le of SE clinical isolates against last-line antibiotics (vancomycin (VA), teicoplanin (TEC), linezolid (LZ) and daptomycin (DA)) for treating CNS infections, during an 8-year period. Methods From January 2005 until December 2012 we examined 518 nonduplicated SE isolates recovered from blood cultures of 421 patients hospitalized in a surgical ICU of our hospital. Species identifi cation and susceptibility testing were performed using the automated VITEK II system (Biomerieux). Additionally we used the E-test method (Biomerieux, ABI-Biodisk) in order to confi rm some isolation resistances against TEC and LZ found by the VITEK II system and to estimate the MIC levels of DA and VA. Mueller-Hinton agar adjusted to contain physiologic levels of free calcium ions (50 \u03bcg/ml) was used when testing DA susceptibility. Isolates with MIC >4 mg/l were considered resistant to TEC and LZ and those with MIC <1 mg/l and MIC <4 mg/l susceptible to DA and VA, respectively. Results The percentage resistance rate of the examined SE isolates is shown in Table 1 . Methicillin resistance was observed with an overall prevalence of approximately 84.6%. All of the resistant isolates to TEC and LZ were also resistant to methicillin. The MIC values of VA were lower than 2 mg/l (Table 1) . Conclusion The examined SE isolates present a scattered resistance to TEC and they show a remarkable continuing increase of resistance to LZ. These fi ndings enforced the necessity to take the appropriate measures in the ICU environment and during the clinical practice to limit the dissemination and the amplifi cation of these resistances. DA and VA possess an excellent in vitro activity against SE isolates and they could be very good alternative solutions for treating ICU infections caused by this species.",

Outbreak management is expensive and time consuming, and therefore the possibility of VRE eradication is desirable. Since vancomycin is scarcely absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, treatment with vancomycin per os may result in very high gastrointestinal concentrations (many times the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC)). The purpose of this study is to measure in vivo gastrointestinal concentrations of vancomycin in patients that are treated with a standard dose orally, and to investigate in vitro whether vancomycin is able to kill VRE at concentrations up to 2,000 times the MIC. Methods The faecal vancomycin concentration was measured in eight patients who suff ered a Clostridium diffi cile infection and were treated with 4\u00d7500 mg vancomycin orally per day. In vitro, a (1:2) dilution series of vancomycin (range 6,250 to 0.4 \u03bcg/ml) was created and 1 ml vancomycin solution was then added to 1 ml standardized inoculum. One vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus isolate (VSE, MIC = 3 \u03bcg/ ml) and two VRE isolates (MIC = 16 \u03bcg/ml) were studied. After 1, 7 and 14 days incubation at 35\u00b0C, growth was defi ned as macroscopic visible turbidity. To test for surviving bacteria, all inocula were cultured to sheep blood agar plates, which were read after 24-hour incubation at 35\u00b0C. E-tests to measure MIC were performed on relevant samples. The in vitro experiment was performed twice. Results The faecal vancomycin concentration in patients treated orally with vancomycin was 8,000 \u03bcg/ml on average. VSE growth at day 14 was detected at up to 1.5 \u03bcg/ml vancomycin, whereas VRE growth was detected at up to 98 \u03bcg/ml. The MIC of these VRE species growing at 98 \u03bcg/ml vancomycin was increased (\u2265256 \u03bcg/ml). For both VSE and VRE, surviving bacteria were detected at very high concentrations of vancomycin (>98 \u03bcg/ml): the MIC of these survivors was not increased. Conclusion Oral treatment with vancomycin results in extremely high faecal concentrations. At these high concentrations, VRE bacteria are killed in vitro; however, a minority of the VRE is able to survive. Vancomycin thus seems unsuitable for eradication. However, high concentrations of vancomycin dramatically reduce the bacterial VRE load. Therefore oral treatment with vancomycin may help to terminate VRE outbreaks: a dramatic reduction in bacterial load of the colonised patient will minimise the risk of patient-to-patient transmission.",

In our multidisciplinary ICU, a short course of antibiotic monotherapy (5 to 7 days) is generally used as Critical Care 2014, Volume 18 Suppl 1 http://ccforum.com/supplements/18/S1 a strategy to treat bacteraemia, unless specifi cally indicated otherwise (for example, endocarditis, osteomyelitis). We aimed to determine the impact of this strategy on antibiotic resistance patterns and patient outcomes compared with a similar exercise we conducted in 2000 [1] . Methods We conducted a retrospective study of all patients with bacteraemia or fungaemia (community-acquired, hospital-acquired, and ICU-acquired) treated in our university hospital ICU over a 6-month period (December 2012 to May 2013). We compared this against data from blood culture-positive patients admitted between February and July 2000. Information was collected on bacteraemia episodes, causative pathogens, antimicrobial resistance patterns, antibiotic use and duration, and patient outcomes. Notably, our ICU admits many immunosuppressed patients (for example, haemoncology). Results Table 1 presents demographics and incidence of bacteraemia. Antimicrobial resistance remained low in the 2013 cohort with few multi-resistant Gram-negative organisms, few fungaemia episodes and a marked decrease in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Figure 1 ). The number of relapses and breakthrough bacteraemias remained low. Conclusion A strategy of short-course antibiotic monotherapy is associated with low breakthrough and relapse rates and a low rate of antibiotic resistance. Community-acquired bacteraemia 57%; 6 (5 to 6) 65% 5 (3 to 5)",

Introduction Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis plays a crucial role in preventing sternal wound infection after cardiac surgery [1] . In institutions with high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococci species, vancomycin prophylaxis is recommended either as a monotherapy or as an adjuvant agent [2] . In our study, we assessed sternal wound infection rates before and after the introduction of a vancomycin prophylaxis protocol. Methods Twenty-six of a total 227 consecutive cardiac surgical patients, between July and December 2012, developed sternal wound infection (Group A). All of the patients received a standard empirical antibiotic prophylaxis. From January to July 2013, 308 patients underwent cardiac surgery (Group B). In this group, we applied a more restricted antibiotic protocol, considering the resistance patterns and the results of microbiological tests of group A. We also evaluated the results of MIC susceptibility testing of fi ve antibiotics: oxacillin, linezolide, daptomycin, teicoplanin and vancomycin. In the new protocol the fi rst vancomycin dose was given 1 hour before sternal incision followed by three additional doses (48 hours duration). Thirty-three of these yielded signifi cant results (6.1%) but only nine (1.7%) were deemed clinically useful. A total of 102 cultures were taken in the fi rst 24 hours of the ICU, of which 17 were positive (16.7%) and six were useful (5.9%). Fifty-three were taken over the next 24 hours, of which two were positive and two were useful (3.8%). Forty-four cultures were taken over the following 24 hours, of which two were positive (4.5%) and one was useful (2.3%). A total of 343 cultures were taken subsequent to this in the ICU, of which 12 were positive (3.5%) and three were deemed useful (0.9%). Of 22 blood cultures taken in the 24 hours post ICU, one was positive but deemed useful (4.5% yield). Conclusion These results demonstrate overall low clinical utility of blood cultures but specifi cally that utility of ICU cultures is signifi cantly lower than pre ICU (1.7% vs. 6.7%; P = 0.0001). The yield of positive blood cultures and their clinical utility also decrease during ICU stay. This may refl ect appropriate empirical antibiotics and lower bacteraemia burden in later illness. Given the low clinical yield and a lack of established sensitive or specifi c triggers [1] , we suggest further work in an ICU setting to maximise utility whilst minimising harm. Reference",

An initial audit of patients with sepsis who were referred to the GSTT critical care outreach team revealed very low overall compliance to the SSC 3-hour bundle. A novel quality improvement campaign was instituted with the aim of improving bundle compliance. Methods A retrospective cohort study in a university hospital was performed. Patients on level 1 wards with severe sepsis registered in the adult critical care response team (CCRT) database in November 2012 were identifi ed (Cohort A). Physiological observation, track and trigger scores, compliance with the 3-hour bundle elements (measured lactate, blood cultures before antibiotics, fl uid challenge, early antibiotics), antimicrobial stewardship and 28-day mortality were recorded. Following this, a quality improvement project was initiated: central to this was an electronic 'SEPSIS' order set, containing appropriate investigations and a step-by-step management guide for use on level 1 wards. A 'viral' print and social media campaign were also undertaken. Compliance to the SSC early care bundle was re-examined in two cohorts of patients in July 2013; patients that were referred to the CCRT as before (Cohort B) and also patients who had the electronic order set activated (Cohort C).",

The percentage of CD69-positive neutrophils was signifi cantly increased across all three groups relative to controls, with little variation between AKI, SIRS and AKI + SIRS patients. Introduction Approximately 50% of acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with sepsis. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C are the two most widely used biomarkers for AKI. However, these two markers are also aff ected by the systemic infl ammatory response, and their diagnostic value in sepsis-induced AKI is disputed [1, 2] . Unlike clinical AKI, animal models can be used to explore single etiology. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between infl ammatory mediators and biomarkers for AKI in a sepsis model in rats. Methods Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in 60 adult SD rats and then observed for AKI and survival. Blood and urine samples were collected at baseline, and 18, 22, and 48 hours after CLP. AKI severity was assessed by RIFLE criteria (creatinine only). The associations between plasma IL-6 and plasma NGAL, plasma cystatin C, urine NGAL and urine cystatin C were analyzed. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves (AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic capability between severe AKI (RIFLE-I or RIFLE-F) and no AKI (includes RIFLE-R) for diff erent biomarkers.",

The aim was to evaluate whether UOT could provide warning signs of an insuffi cient renal oxygen supply, which can lead to postoperative AKI. Methods Fourteen subjects undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB were included in this prospective clinical pilot study. UOT was measured perioperatively in all patients, both in the operating room (before, during and after CPB) and in the ICU. Biomarkers of AKI in blood and urine were measured preoperatively and postoperatively at 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours after the initiation of CPB. These included serum creatinine and the early urinary biomarkers kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C.

References Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) in surgical critically ill patients is an independent risk factor for early mortality. Two novel urine biomarkers, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), may help to detect clinically silent episodes of AKI in the golden hours prior to irreversible damage of the kidney. We evaluated the early predictive value of these biomarkers for AKI, moderate and severe AKI, early requirement of renal replacement therapy (RRT), and ICU mortality, with a cutoff value of IGFBP7/TIMP-2 >0.3. Methods Four to six hours after admission to the surgical ICU, urine biomarkers were prospectively evaluated in all patients with present exposures and susceptibilities for AKI according to the KDIGO recommendation. The incidence and severity of AKI (KDIGO 2012) and requirement of RRT were assessed over 48 hours after admission. In addition, ICU mortality and variables such a norepinephrine dose, mean arterial pressure, hemoglobin level, cumulative fl uid balance and urine production were noted at the time of biomarker evaluation (4 to 6 hours) and for the fi rst 24 hours after admission. The predictive values of biomarkers were better for early prediction than clinical parameters such as urine output within the fi rst 6 hours after admission to ICU.",

Conclusion The reported incidence of AKI in critical care ranges from 20 to 50%, with the highest rates seen in sepsis [1] . Utilisation of CRRT for AKI is higher at our centre than the described 5% [2] , potentially due to close collaboration between critical care and nephrology [3] or relatively lenient ICU admission criteria. Increasing mortality was seen with age, APACHE II score and delay in initiation of RRT. Prospective analysis is required to look at determining biomarkers for AKI and risk factors for mortality; dynamic monitoring of haemodynamic responders (\uf0adMAP, \uf0afvasopressor requirement <24 hours), percentage creatinine decrease [4] , severity-of-illness scores and urine output.

            "text": "The study included 44 patients in the citrate group versus 61 in the heparin group. We found no statistical signifi cant diff erences for: age (P = 0.06); SAPS II (P = 0.28); SOFA (P = 0.19); the timing of beginning of the technique (P = 0.61), with 34.8% versus 47.5% of patients in R (RIFLE), 27.8% versus 18% in I (RIFLE) and 16% versus 21% in F (RIFLE); duration of the technique (P = 0.74) and length of stay. Although we noticed a greater loss of dose and absolute creatinine clearance in the citrate group, this had no statistical signifi cance (P = 0.18 and P = 0.13). The mortality found for citrate and heparin groups was 60.4% and 39.4% respectively. The diff erences with statistical signifi cance related to dialitrauma emerged in K + (P = 0.03), Ca 2+ (P = 0.02), Na + (P = 0.004), platelets (P = 0.002), pH (P = 0.02) and bicarbonate (P = 0.0001). Conclusion We may say that there are functional diff erences that must be taken into account. Despite not having statistical signifi cance on this sample, losses of dose and creatinine clearance showed a direct relation with mortality. Reference and mean aortic cross-clamping of 98 minutes (range 25 to 190). We measured MyG, procalcitonin (PCT), and creatinin (sCr) at ICU admission and, if serum MyG was higher than 600 mg/dl, the patient was treated with CVVHD-EMIC2-citrate anticoagulant within 12 hours of ICU admission for 72 hours and a dose of 2,000 ml/hour. Biochemical assays were obtained at 12, 24, and 72 hours and at ICU discharge. Results The pretreatment MyG median value was 10,789 ng/ml; it signifi cantly reduced on average 92.8% during CVVHD (see Figure 1 ) and it remained low at ICU discharge (median value 114 ng/ml). sCr remained stable (average time value equal to 0.94 mg/dl) during CVVHD; PCT also decreased over time with a reduction rate equal to 78% (from 5.35 \u00b1 4.39 mg/dl to 1.23 \u00b1 1.09 mg/dl at the end of CVVHD). Finally, six patients survived at 90 days. Conclusion This small experience confi rms that serum MyG is likely to increase in post-cardiac surgical high-risk patients and suggests a benefi cial eff ect of CRRT treatments with EMIC2 membranes and citrate on serum MyG, potentially preventing AKI. Further larger assessment can be advised for confi rmation. Reference Introduction Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by breakdown of striated muscle due to a great number of causes. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication as a consequence of high concentrations of circulating myoglobin (Mb). The AKI degree can vary but often requires dialysis, a condition which drastically worsens the ICU stay and prognosis. Since Mb overconcentration represents the cause of AKI, one of the therapy's aims should be its removal to prevent further kidney damage and to allow faster renal recovery. Both intermittent hemodialysis and high-volume CVVHF are poorly eff ective in removing Mb, while smallprotein leakage membranes seem to be promising in this setting. The aim of our study was therefore to measure effi cacy of Mb removal of a new high cutoff membrane (EMIC2; Fresenius, cutoff value 40 kDa) for continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) in the ICU setting. Methods We report results of EMIC2-based treatments in seven patients (four male/three female) with diff erent causes of rhabdomyolysis (trauma, sepsis, limb ischemia). Five patients had classic dialysis indications (persistent anuria) while in two patients treatment was prophylactically started. CRRT were delivered in CVVHD mode with the EMIC2 dialyzer and with loco-regional trisodium-citrate anticoagulation. Mb plasma levels were assessed each 12 hours while the removal rate, total body and dialyzer clearances were estimated by kinetic modeling as previously described [1] . Clinical data were also collected and both global and renal patient survival was reported. Results The median Mb value at CRRT start was 6,971 ng/ml (range 4,679 to 48,011 ng/ml). CRRT were delivered with an average blood fl ow rate of 143 \u00b1 45 ml/minute and a dialysate fl ow rate of 2,134 \u00b1 1,334 ml/hour. These operating conditions allowed one to stop treatment on average after 75 \u00b1 47 hours (median 54 hours) with a Mb reduction of 82.2% (range 99.4 to 44.4%). Overall median Mb removal per treatment was 59 mg (range 33 to 279 mg) mainly due to the fi rst 24 hours of treatment (54 mg, range 20 to 187 mg). Only two patients had residual renal function that was in one case measured to account for only 7.45 mg Mb removal during the entire treatment. Six patients survived and recovered renal function with no dialysis need at present follow-up. One patient died during the ICU stay. Conclusion Our data measured high performance of the EMIC2 membrane in Mb removal and confi rm theoretical models indicating that CRRT with a high cutoff membrane can achieve major Mb removal within 24 hours with great superiority in comparison with all other available techniques. Reference Introduction Removing the middle molecular weight substances including cytokines and albumin-bound toxin could be eff ective for patients with acute liver failure (ALF). We have developed a new system, plasma fi ltration with dialysis (plasma diafi ltration (PDF)) [1, 2] , and assessed its effi cacy in multicenter analysis. Methods A subgroup analysis of an observational study conducted in the ICUs of six hospitals. In PDF, simple plasma exchange is performed using a selective membrane plasma separator (Evaxclio EC-2A; Kawasumi Chemical Inc., Tokyo Japan), which has a sieving coeffi cient of 0.3 for albumin, while the dialysate fl ows outside the hollow fi bers. The fl ow rate of the blood, dialysate, substitute and additional substitute was 80 to 100 ml/minute, 600 ml/hour, and 0 to 450 ml/hour according to the rate of water elimination and 150 ml/ hour, respectively. As the substitute from the additional fl uid line, we added 1,200 ml (150 ml/hour) of fresh frozen plasma followed by 50 ml of 25% albumin considering the loss of albumin by diff usion. As an anticoagulant, nafamostat mesilate (Torii Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was used at a rate of 15 to 25 mg/hour. Results A multicenter study was underway from October 2005 to August 2011. We performed PDF on 65 patients with ALF (severe sepsis, 22; post operation, 15; fulminant hepatitis, 11; alcohol hepatitis, 3; graft versus host disease, 4; and others, 10). The serum total bilirubin, plasma PT-INR and the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score before the PDF procedure were 15.0 \u00b1 8.15 mg/dl (average \u00b1 SD), 2.3 \u00b1 1.5 and 35.8 \u00b1 9.3, respectively. PDF was performed as 9.2 \u00b1 13.2 sessions per patient and the overall 28-day survival rate was 68.5%. According to the severity of the MELD score, we stratifi ed patients into three categories defi ned by the MELD score. The numbers of patients were 15 (23%) in score 20 to 29, 30 (46%) in score 30 to 39 and 19 (29%) in score over 40.",

            "text": "Introduction Acute liver failure (ALF) is a critical illness with high mortality. Plasma diafi ltration (PDF) is a blood purifi cation therapy in which simple plasma exchange is performed using a selective membrane plasma separator while the dialysate fl ows outside the hollow fi bers. While several studies demonstrated that PDF therapy is a useful blood purifi cation therapy for patients with ALF, PDF therapy is often diffi cult to employ in ALF patients complicated with multiple organ failure, especially in those with unstable hemodynamics. Furthermore, it is likely to re-occur immediately after PDF therapy. We developed continuous PDF (CPDF) as a new concept in PDF therapy, and assessed its effi cacy and safety in ALF patients compared with conventional plasma exchange (PE) plus continuous hemodiafi ltration (CHDF) therapy in this study. Methods Ten ALF patients (gender: male/female = 6/4, age: 47 \u00b1 14) employed CPDF therapy. The primary outcomes were altered liver function, measured by the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, and total bilirubin and prothrombin time International Normalized Ratio (PT-INR), 5 days after CPDF therapy. Secondary outcomes included Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, 5 days after CPDF therapy, and the survival rate 14 days after this therapy. Results The MELD score (34.5 to 28.0; P = 0.005), total bilirubin (10.9 to 7.25 mg/dl; P = 0.048), PT-INR (1.89 to 1.31; P = 0.084), and SOFA score (10.0 to 7.5; P <0.039) were improved 5 days after CPDF therapy. Nine patients were alive and one patient died due to acute pancreatitis, complicated by ALF. The effi cacy of CPDF therapy for maintaining liver function and renal function was not inferior to PE plus CHDF therapy. Parameters of renal function such as the creatinine value were also improved 5 days after CPDF therapy. Circulation parameters such as mean arterial pressure and heart rate were maintained without inotropic and vasopressor support during the CPDF treatment period. The oxygenation index (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) as a measure of pulmonary function tended to increase after this treatment. We could employ this treatment without any adverse events, such as infections and unstable hemodynamics. Conclusion In the present study, CPDF therapy safely supported liver function and generally improved the condition of critically ill patients with ALF. Introduction It has been demonstrated that blood purifi cation therapy performed by means of venovenous hemodialysis with high cutoff membranes (HCO-CVVHD) may modulate the host infl ammatory response in septic patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), potentially limiting organ dysfunction. Improvement in hemodynamics and respiratory function has been described during HCO-CVVHD treatment [1] . The Sepsis in Florence sTudy (SIFT) has been designed to evaluate changes in infl ammatory biomarkers and tissue oxygenation/perfusion indexes in septic ICU patients with AKI during HCO-CVVHD. Methods Patients with microbiologically confi rmed severe sepsis/ septic shock and AKI (RIFLE criteria F or more) treated with HCO-CVVHD, started within 12 hours from the diagnosis, were prospectively included in the study. The cumulative vasopressor index (CVI), C-reactive protein levels (CRP), serum lactate concentration (Lac) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2 ) were measured before (T0h) and at 24 hours and 48 hours after HCO-CVVHD initiation. Data are expressed as the median (range). The Mann-Whitney U test was applied to detect diff erences in CVI, CRP, Lac and ScvO 2 at the three time points (statistical signifi cance for P <0.05). Results In 16 ICUs, a total of 16 patients (six cardiac surgery, four abdominal surgery and six medical) met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. A signifi cant reduction in CRP levels was observed over time: 263 (216 to 358) mg/dl at T0h to 153 (56 to 186) mg/dl at T48h (P <0.05). ScvO 2 signifi cantly increased from 45 (40 to 55)% at T0h to 75 (68 to 77)% at T48h (P <0.05). Finally, serum lactate decreased from 5.1 (3.0 to 9.5) mmol/l at T0h to 1.6 (1.0 to 4.6) mmol/l at T48h (P <0.05). Conversely, CVI did not signifi cantly reduce over time (8.2 (4 to 9) at T0h vs. 4.5 (4 to 8) at T48h, P >0.05). Conclusion Our preliminary data show that patients with sepsisrelated AKI may benefi t from early treatment with HCO-CVVHD. The modulation of proinfl ammatory and anti-infl ammatory mediators, as previously demonstrated [1] , may improve microcirculation, tissue perfusion and cellular oxygenation. Although promising, our results must be confi rmed at the end of the study with larger observations. Finally, a subgroup analysis is absolutely mandatory in order to explore diff erent behaviors of tissue perfusion indexes in diff erent populations of patients. Introduction Little information is available regarding ciprofl oxacin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in sepsis patients receiving sustained low-effi ciency dialysis (SLED). This study determined the pharmacokinetics and simulated pharmacodynamics of ciprofl oxacin in ICU patients during SLED. Methods This study was a prospective evaluation of ciprofl oxacin pharmacokinetics in patients with sepsis and >18 years of age, urine output <200 ml/day and receiving SLED for at least 8 hours. Following informed consent, plasma samples were collected at baseline and 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after a ciprofl oxacin 400 mg dose i.v. during SLED and post-SLED therapy at the same times. Dialysate samples were collected at 4-hour intervals during SLED. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using WinNonlin and compared between the two periods. Simulated pharmacodynamic parameters were determined for Pseudomonas aeruginosa using MIC = 2. Results A total of seven patients (four male, three female, age 56.9 \u00b1 7.6, APACHE II 26.8 \u00b1 2.4) were enrolled. Ciprofl oxacin was cleared relatively rapidly with a half-life of 6.9 hours and a Ke of 0.108/hour during SLED compared with 11.9 hours and 0.057/hour post-SLED (P <0.05). Simulated pharmacodynamics demonstrated inadequate coverage for P. aeruginosa during SLED with Cmax/MIC ratio 5.7 \u00b1 1.2 and AUC/MIC 77.5 \u00b1 22.3. Conclusion Ciprofl oxacin is rapidly cleared during SLED similar to clearance during normal renal function, which may result in adequate pharmacodynamic coverage for some pathogens.",

            "text": "Introduction Antibiotic dosing for patients with acute renal failure receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a clinical challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of meropenem (M) during CRRT. Methods A prospective and multicenter study was conducted at seven hospitals. Fifteen critically ill patients undergoing either continuous venovenous hemofi ltration (CVVHF) or hemodiafi ltration (CVVHDF) were included. Serum and ultrafi ltrate (UF) levels of M were determined by liquid chromatography. Blood samples were drawn 24 hours after starting CRRT at 08:00 a.m., 09:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m., 01:00 p.m., 06:00 p.m., 20:00 p.m. and 08:00 a.m. of the following day. CRRT clearance (Cl), total amount of M in the UF (MUF), percentage of the dose extracted by CRRT (EF) and the AUC (ng/hour/ml) were calculated. Results Nine patients were treated with CVVHDF and six with CVVHF. M (0.5 to 2 g) was administered every 6 to 12 h by i.v. infusion over 15 minutes. Data (mean and SD) concerning the dialysate fl ow rate (DF; ml/hour), blood fl ow rate (ml/minute) and the average UF rate (ml/ kg/hour) for CRRT techniques are shown in Table 1 . Pharmacokinetic Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the critically ill is an independent risk factor for adverse outcome [1] . Previously, it was suggested that high-volume haemofi ltration (HVHF) may confer a mortality benefi t and lead to a reduction in organ failure compared with standard ultrafi ltration rates (UF) [2] . This was not confi rmed by a recent investigation [3] . It has also not been determined whether ideal Introduction Sepsis-induced immunosuppression has long been considered a factor in the late mortality of sepsis patients, but little is known about the immunity of immunocompetent cells and the eff ect of polymyxin B-immobilized fi ber hemoperfusion therapy (PMX-DHP) on sepsis-induced immunosuppression. The present study was designed to evaluate the eff ect of PMX-DHP on recovery from sepsisrelated immunodefi ciency. Methods Patients with septic shock who were treated with PMX-DHP were enrolled in this study. Study 1: (1) numbers of peripheral lymphocytes and CD4 + T cells, especially regulatory T cells (Tregs), and serum cytokine levels were examined to evaluate the eff ects of PMX-DHP in septic shock patients. (2) Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in these patients were examined to evaluate infl ammatory cytokine production before and after PMX-DHP. The obtained PBMCs were stimulated with interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-12, anti-CD3 antibody, or lipopolysaccharide for 24 hours, and tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) production in the culture supernatants was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Study 2: whole blood from patients with sepsis was incubated with a polymyxin B-immobilized fi lter (cut into small sizes) for small animals for 2 hours (PMX group), or were treated with 200 \u03bcg polymyxin B for 2 hours (PLB group), or were not treated (sepsis group). IFN\u03b3 production by PBMCs was compared among the three groups. Results Study 1: (1) the number of CD4 + T cells was lower and the percentage of Tregs in CD4 + T cells was higher in septic shock patients compared with those without shock. A signifi cant increase in the number of CD4 + T cells, a signifi cant decrease in the percentage of Tregs in the CD4 + T-cell population, and a signifi cant decrease in serum IL-10 levels were observed 24 hours after PMX-DHP in septic shock patients who survived compared with those who did not. (2) IFN\u03b3 production by PBMCs was signifi cantly lower in patients with sepsis than in healthy volunteers. IFN\u03b3 production by IL-2-stimulated and IL-12-stimulated PBMCs signifi cantly increased after PMX-DHP therapy. Study 2: IFN\u03b3 production by PBMCs in patients with sepsis increased signifi cantly in the PMX and PLB groups compared with that in the sepsis group. Conclusion PMX-DHP directly decreased the number and percentage of Tregs in peripheral blood circulating CD4 + T cells in patients with septic shock. PMX-DHP improved IFN\u03b3 production by natural killer (NK)/NKT cells in patients with septic shock. Therefore, PMX-DHP could improve sepsis-related immunosuppression. [1, 2] . The Actigraph device is a sleep watch that has been shown to have equivalent accuracy to polysomnography and previously used during critical illness to show sleep disruption [3] . Our objective was to assess patients long-term sleep quality using the Actigraph device. Methods Study patients were selected from a 24-bed multidisciplinary ICU. Thirteen patients who were \u226518 years old, stayed longer than 4 days in the ICU and did not have and acute brain injury were followed up at 2 months post hospital discharge. The Actigraph device was given to patients to take home and worn for 72 hours. Previously validated algorithms were used to analyze sleep and wake cycles [4] . Additionally, patient completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PQSI), as a measure of subjective sleep quality. Results Sixty-two percent of patients at 2 months post hospital discharge reported poor sleep quality as per the PSQI. The Actigraph results showed patients' average total sleep time was 6.15 hours, with a sleep effi ciency of 78%. The mean time to fall asleep was 12 minutes. Patients had an average of 11 awakenings per night and were awake for an average of 7 minutes during the awakenings. There were no associations found between patients' perceived sleep quality and total sleep, sleep effi ciency or sleep disruptions. Patients' severity of illness, as measured by the APACHE II score, was statistically associated with lower total sleep time (\u03b2 = -12.6, P = 0.019), reduced sleep effi ciency (\u03b2 = -1.18, P = 0.042) and higher number of sleep disruptions (\u03b2 = 0.64, P = 0.023). The number of days ventilated or ICU and hospital length of stay were not statistically associated with the Actigraph sleep parameters. Conclusion Survivors of critical illness have high levels of sleep dysfunction as measured by actigraphy. Patients' severity of illness while critically ill appears to increase the level of long-term sleep dysfunction experienced. There is discordance between objective and subjective measures of sleep quality, which has been shown previously [5] . Objective measures of sleep quality are needed on a larger number of patients to confi rm these fi ndings.",

We recommended regular monitoring of these parameters when propofol sedation is used for over 3 days and that propofol-sparing agents are considered in these patients at risk of developing PRIS. Methods In patients who required propofol sedation for 4 days or more, we prospectively monitored: frequency of performing lipid profi le and 12-lead ECG; and frequency of co-administration of a propofol-sparing agent. Providers rated sedation satisfaction, cough, and the ability to perform the intended procedure using a 100 mm visual analog scale at the end of the procedure blind to BIS (0 unsatisfi ed to 100 satisfi ed). Patients were surveyed at 1 hour and 24 hours regarding overall sedation, symptoms, and procedure recall (unpleasant recall 1, no recall 4). Group diff erences were considered statistically signifi cant at P <0.05. Results Twenty-six procedures were monitored, 20 with CS and six endobronchial ultrasound procedures with DS. There was no diff erence with respect to age or gender. The mean doses of midazolam and fentanyl were 5 mg and 85 \u03bcg, respectively. BIS values were lower at all predefi ned points of the procedure for DS cases versus CS. Physicians were more satisfi ed with sedation and the lack of cough with DS, but there was no signifi cant diff erence in patient satisfaction between the two groups with regards to overall sedation, procedure-related symptoms or willingness to have repeat bronchoscopy. Patients with no recall had lower nadir BIS scores (46 vs. 71, P = 0.03) and scores at procedure end (76 vs. 94, P = 0.04) compared with those with any recall. There was no diff erence in the doses of midazolam or fentanyl in CS cases despite statistically signifi cant diff erences in patient recall and BIS scores. Junior fellows scored greater satisfaction with sedation, were less bothered by cough and more often felt able to perform the intended procedure compared with senior fellows. Conclusion Deep sedation resulted in greater physician satisfaction with procedural conditions as well as lower BIS scores but no signifi cant diff erence in patient satisfaction compared with conscious sedation. Patients with no recall of the procedure had lower BIS scores at the nadir and end of the procedure. BIS may be a novel tool to monitor procedural depth, allowing proceduralists to better monitor the narrow window between adequate sedation and dangerous oversedation.",

In fact, we identifi ed at least 25 epidural hematomas that occurred so far from the following countries: Belgium (n = 1), Brazil (n = 1), France (n = 1), Germany (n = 2), India (n = 2), Italy (n = 1), Japan (n = 2), Korea (n = 1), Malaysia (n = 1), Norway (n = 2), Russia (n = 3), Sweden (n = 1), the UK (n = 3), and the USA (n = 4). Even if from the public health point of view the benefi ts seem to encourage the use of epidural analgesia in cardiac surgery with a possible reduction in perioperative mortality, this topic merits further investigation and the decision to insert the epidural catheter should be discussed with the patient considering both local experience and legal dispute in case of medical complications. Introduction It has been established that early enteral nutrition in critically ill patients improves overall outcome and mortality. In our unit, feeding protocols were established based on the ESPEN recommendations and have been implemented for the last 2 years. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the compliance of our septic patients' nutritional approach with our feeding protocols.",

All patients were dependent on mechanical ventilation and met the CCM criteria for sepsis upon admission to the ICU. APACHE II score, SOFA score, weight, BMI and nutritional status were calculated. Patients were initiated for enteral feeding based on the established feeding protocol within 48 hours of admission. The feeding status of the patient was recorded on the start day (D0), day 3 (D3) and day 7 (D7). Factors aff ecting the feeding process and its progression were also recorded Results The patient mean age was 71.4 \u00b1 12.2. LOS in the ICU was 9 to 21 days. Based on BMI, 18% of the patients were malnourished upon admission. APACHE II was 26 \u00b1 7.8 and SOFA was 9.2 \u00b1 4.6. The mortality rate was 42.5%. Enteral nutrition started early in 64 (77.1%) of the patients (D0), on day 3 (D3) 29 (45.31%) patients met their caloric goals and on day 7 (D7) only 18 (28.1%) patients achieved their caloric goals. Discontinuation of enteral feeding was mainly due to procedures, whereas late start and/or decreased hourly intake were due to GI complications, GI intolerance, excessive diarrhoea and hemodynamic instability. There was no association between compliance with the feeding protocol and the LOS, nutritional status, severity or disease progression.",

Its supplementation has signifi cant cost and risk including hypotension and hypocalcaemia. We investigated whether changing frequency of routine serum phosphate testing had eff ects on the detected incidence of abnormal plasma levels and prescription of phosphate. Methods This was a service improvement project using observational, anonymous data. We collected data on serum phosphate levels in a 33-bed ITU over two 6-month periods before and after introduction of a new testing regime (phases 1 and 2 Conclusion Reducing testing from daily to three times weekly was not associated with a signifi cant change in mean phosphate levels nor with detection of abnormally high/low phosphate levels. Daily testing, however, is associated with higher rates of phosphate prescription. It is known that there is signifi cant diurnal variation in serum phosphate [2] and we speculate that mild hypophosphataemia self-corrects without intervention. Treating mild hypophosphatemia may therefore not be indicated.",

In this work we studied the structure of water-electrolyte complications in patients in the neurological intensive care with acute brain injury. Methods We analyzed 259 cases of water-electrolyte disturbances that developed in patients treated in the Department of Intensive Care of Russian Polenov's Neurosurgical Institute from 2001 to 2012. Patients were between 16 and 55 years old. A total of 142 patients were operated for brain tumor, 72 of them of basal-supratentorial localization; eight severe brain trauma; 62 of the hemorrhagic type of stroke, one herpes encephalitis. We excluded from this study the patients with heart and renal failure receiving diuretics. We measured BP, HR, CVP, hourly and daily urine output, level of K and Na in plasma, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) one to four times a day, and levels of K and Na in urine in single and daily servings. All patients were receiving dexamethasone at a dose between 8 and 32 mg/day as an anti-edema therapy, and thus levels of ACTH and cortisol were not investigated. Underlying this is an ultradian rhythm of discrete pulses [1] as a result of the feedforward:feedback interactions between cortisol and ACTH [2] . These pulses are critical for normal function; pulsatile and constant infusions yield diff erent transcriptional responses [3] and patients on optimal (nonpulsatile) glucocorticoid replacement have twice the age-related mortality of the general population [4] . We have now characterised the ultradian rhythm and pituitary-adrenal interaction of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods Twenty male patients presenting for elective CABG (on-pump and off -pump) were recruited. Blood samples were taken for 24 hours from placement of the fi rst venous access. Cortisol was sampled every 10 minutes, ACTH was sampled every hour and cortisol binding globulin (CBG) was sampled at baseline, at the end of operation and at the end of the 24-hour period.",

Dozens of diff erent insulin protocols for ICUs have been developed with diff erent complexity, eff ectiveness, blood glucose (BG) variability and safety. Although comparison of existing protocols is diffi cult due to signifi cant diff erences in processes and outcome measures, computerized clinical decision support systems generally achieved better GC with consistently lower hypoglycaemia rates than that achieved with paper-based protocols [1] . The enhanced Model Predictive Control (eMPC) algorithm, developed by the CLINICIP group, is the eff ective clinically proven protocol, which has been successfully tested at multiple institutions on medical and surgical patients with diff erent nutritional protocols [2, 3] . The eMPC models the behaviour of glucose and insulin in ICU patients with a variable sample interval based on the accuracy of the BG prediction. It has been integrated in the B.Braun Space GlucoseControl (SGC) system, which allows direct data communication between pumps and Space Control with the incorporated eMPC algorithm.

Patients in this trial were assigned to the target range 4.4 to 8.3 mmol/l. Nutritional management (enteral, parenteral or both) was carried out at the discretion of the each centre. Results Seventeen centres from nine European countries included a total of 508 patients. During the study a total of 29,575 BG values were entered into the SGCs and the same number of recommendations were rendered. The mean time-in-target was 77.5 \u00b1 20.9%. The mean proposed next measurement time was 2.0 \u00b1 0.5 hours. Only four episodes of hypoglycaemia <2.2 mmol/l occurred (0.01% of measurements).

However, current methods of blood glucose (BG) monitoring are invasive, intermittent and laborintensive. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has potential to improve safety/effi cacy of BG control. The performance of a noninvasive, transdermal CGM system (Symphony CGM; Echo Therapeutics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) was evaluated in post-surgical ICU patients. Methods Adult surgical patients with planned ICU admission of \u226524 hours at four medical centers were consented. Following admission to the ICU, the skin of an upper arm was cleaned and a 6 mm diameter site was prepared with controlled micro-abrasion using the Symphony CGM system. A transdermal CGM sensor containing glucose oxidase was applied. Following a 1-hour warm-up period, a calibration was performed. Blood samples were obtained from a radial artery catheter approximately every hour, centrifuged to plasma, and glucose was measured using a YSI 2300 STAT Plus Glucose Analyzer (reference BG). A maximum of 30 reference BG samples were collected for each patient. Samples were collected as frequently as every 15 minutes for trend analysis. CGM was prospectively calibrated every 4 hours. All treatment decisions were based on BG alone. Safety was assessed by visual inspection of the site using a dermatological scale following sensor removal. A study was defi ned as evaluable for CGM sessions >16 hours. Results Thirty-two subjects completed the study. Additional subjects were not considered evaluable due to early discharge from the ICU, failure or early removal of the radial artery catheter, or administration of intravenous acetaminophen. The study cohort was 19% female, 28% diabetes, 56% cardiac surgery, with a mean age of 65 \u00b1 13 years. Overall mean absolute relative diff erence between CGM and reference BG was 12.5%. Continuous glucose error-grid analysis, which assesses point and trend accuracy, showed 98.2% of readings in the A zone (clinically accurate) and 1.2% in the B zone (benign errors). Glucose values ranged from 49 to 324 mg/dl. No device or study-related adverse events were reported.",

Methods The Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre case-mix programme database on adult admissions to general, neuroscience and cardiothoracic critical care units was used for analysis. Within the database, the highest and lowest blood glucose (BG) values measured during the fi rst 24 hours from admission were recorded. BG control value was defi ned as BG (\u22654.0 \u22649.9 mmol/l). Other BG levels were defi ned as: very low, \u22642.2 mmol/l (\u226440 mg/dl); low, >2.2 \u22643.9 mmol/l (40 to 70 mg/dl); high, \u226510.0 <11.1 mmol/l (180 to 200 mg/dl); and very high, \u226511.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl). Results There was an increased incidence of mortality in those patients with at least one BG measure below 3.9 mmol/l (70 mg/dl) compared with those without (Table 1 ). There was a link between BG levels and LoS for surviving patients with the longest hospital stays (critical care and total hospital) experienced by those with BG levels below 2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl). Conclusion There is a strong association between BG levels during admission and mortality and LoS outcomes. Although it is not possible to make the link with causation from our dataset, we present results from the largest single dataset of critical care unit patients [1, 2] .",

The practical benefi t of controlling blood glucose in the critically ill remains contentious, largely because of the lack of tools to adequately measure and therefore manage levels in real time. A system that is able to provide instant, constantly calibrated, accurate values is a major bonus to ICU care and we report here the fi rst clinical use of a novel CGM system directly used to manage postoperative glycaemia. Methods All consecutive consenting adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass and requiring postoperative insulin (>98% of patients) were enrolled in the study with a target enrolment of 100. Blood glucose was measured via a dedicated peripheral intravenous catheter with values reported every 5 minutes. The primary outcome was the number of data points in the target glycaemic control range (4.4 to 8.0 mmol/l), using a dynamic insulin protocol. Secondary endpoints include mean glucose levels, time in range and number of hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic episodes. Results For the fi rst 45 patients, mean age was 67.7 years (male 52.8%), 54% had undergone valve surgery with or without CABG and the majority (67%) had no history of diabetes. The CGM sensor was typically sighted in the forearm or hand (90.5%) and was resited on 7.5% occasions. Median monitoring time in the ICU was 28.4 hours. Mean glycaemic value was 6.8 mmol/l. Performance notably improved with experience and also highlighted that even previously validated dynamic algorithms will need to be refi ned to maximise the benefi t of GGM. Overall, the evidence from the fi rst applied clinical use of this novel CGM showed that proper safe, tight glycaemic control can be achieved. Further investigations are required to demonstrate the reduction in morbidity and mortality using CGM, and we plan to embark on further studies to address this.",

A reduction in GCS was the main reason for ICU admission. All patients received \u22653 anti-TBM drugs and steroids. Two CSF PCR+ve patients had primary drug resistance to isoniazid.

Forty-four consecutive patients were scheduled to undergo thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysmectomy. Two patients had a type B dissecting aneurysm; all other 42 patients suff ered from degenerative aneurysm. Methods During surgery, samples of cerebrospinal fl uid and arterial blood were simultaneously withdrawn to evaluate lactate concentration. Samples were collected at fi ve fi xed times during and after surgery: T1 (beginning of the intervention), T2 (15 minutes after aortic cross-clamping), T3 (just before unclamping), T4 (end of surgery), and T5 (4 hours after the end of surgery). Results Mean lactate levels in cerebrospinal fl uid rose consistently from the beginning of the intervention steadily until after surgery (T1 = 1.83 mmol/l, T2 = 2.10 mmol/l, T3 = 2.72 mmol/l, T4 = 3.70 mmol/l, T5 = 4.31 mmol/l). Seven patients developed spinal cord injury; two of them had delayed injury occurring 24 hours after the end of surgery; the remaining fi ve had early onset. In this group of fi ve patients, preoperative cerebrospinal fl uid lactate levels were signifi cantly (P = 0.04) higher than those of the other 40 patients preoperatively (2.12 \u00b1 0.35 vs. 1.79 \u00b1 0.29 mmol/l).

Injuries below C4 level represented 51.5% of the population. A complete loss of motor function (ASIA level A and B) was found in 34.9% of patients. The mean and median ISS score was 20.7. In total, 78 patients required MV (37.5%) and 30 patients required prolonged MV (14.4%). After multivariate analysis, four predictors of MV were identifi ed: pneumonia (OR = 52.83); ISS score >22 (OR = 4.09); age (OR = 1.02); level C1 to C4 (2.34); and two predictors of prolonged MV: ASIA score A and B (OR = 5.57) and pneumonia (OR = 8.76). Conclusion In our study ISS, cervical level and age were associated with MV but not with the need for prolonged MV, whereas pneumonia was an independent risk factor for both. This is a potentially preventable risk factor where specifi c strategies can be applied to improve patients' outcome.",

The model retains identical performance for all criteria in the cohort of more recent TBI patients of the AVERT-IT database. Conclusion The obtained external validation results, on a previously unseen cohort of adult TBI patients, confi rm the robustness of the model to accurately predict future increased ICP events 30 minutes in advance. The general applicability of the model is probably due to its sparseness, as it only uses two routinely monitored signals as input, namely ICP and MAP.

RAGE immunoreactivity was not detected in any regions of the CA1 to 3 regions of the sham group. RAGE immunoreactivity was detected only in the CA1 region from 3 days post ischemia, and the RAGE immunoreactivity was newly expressed in astrocytes, not in neurons. In addition, the level of RAGE protein was highest at 5 days post ischemia. In brief, both the RAGE immunoreactivity and protein level were distinctively increased in astrocytes in the ischemic CA1 region from 3 days after transient cerebral ischemia. Conclusion These results indicate that the increase of RAGE expression in astrocytes at post ischemia may be related to the ischemia-induced activation of astrocytes in the ischemic CA1 region. Introduction The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between continuously monitored regional cerebral blood fl ow (CBF) and microdialysis values in severe subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury patients. Methods Advanced multimodal neuromonitoring including measurements of CBF (QFlow, Hemedex) and brain lactate, pyruvate, lactate/ pyruvate ratio, glycerol and glucose values using microdialysis (CMA600, microdialysis) were performed in 21 patients with severe subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 17) and traumatic brain injury (n = 4). Thirteen of the patients were successfully discharged from the ICU while eight did not survive. Additional recorded parameters include PbrO 2 (Licox, GMS) ICP, CPP, MABP, CVP, local brain temperature, body core temperature, PCO 2 , and blood glucose among others. The cerebral monitoring probes were inserted via a Bolt (ICP, PbrO 2 , microdialysis) and an additional burr hole (CBF). All probes were positioned in the penumbra and location was verifi ed by brain CT. The PbrO 2 arm of this study and its signifi cance is still underway and will be announced later.",

Between 1 January and 31 October 2013 we included neurocritical patients (NCP) with multimodal neuromonitoring (MMN). Daily samples of arterial blood and venous jugular bulb blood were obtained for measuring pCO 2 , lactate, serum sodium and CRP. Results There were 45 NCP, six (13%) with MMN (fi ve men).

During the subsequent examination, which lasted from 3 to 12 months, seven patients with activated Wernicke's area showed further consciousness expansion up to the minimal consciousness state (further consciousness expansion was seen in two patients). Two other patients with activated Wernicke's area did not show any signs of consciousness. Two patients revealed signifi cant activity in the Broca's area. Conclusion According to the fi rst results of the study one can conclude that behind the outwardly similar clinical symptoms in patients in VS lies a diverse (due to the organization of brain functions) group of patients. fMRI enables one to reveal the fi rst signs of cognitive activity; that is, reveals the linguistic value of speech addressed to the patient which cannot be detected during routine neurological examination. Introduction A patient is declared brain dead (BD) when physicians determine permanent loss of brain functions. Unfortunately, criteria for defi ning BD vary across diff erent countries [1] . We therefore decide to survey BD diagnostic modalities in Europe in order to describe diff erences. Methods A multiple-choice questionnaire was developed on an online platform [2] . Direct link was sent to national representatives of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and NeuroIntensive Care section's members. Thirty-three countries were contacted. Answers were reviewed. In cases of discrepancies or missing data, participants were contacted for further clarifi cation. Descriptive statistics have been applied. Results Twenty-eight participants returned the questionnaire (85%). Every country has either specifi c law (93%) or guidelines issued by the scientifi c society (89%). Clinical examination, essential to the diagnosis, is the only requirement in 50% of countries. Coma, apnea, absence of corneal and cough refl exes are always necessary. Blood pressure and electrolytes are checked in 64% as mandatory prerequisites. The apnea test is legally defi ned in 86% of countries. Eighty-two percent of countries require achievement of a target paCO 2 level while the Netherlands' law states target apnea duration. Number of physicians (median 2, range 1 to 4), number of clinical examinations (median 2, 1 to 3), and minimum observation time (median 3 hours, 0 to 12) are variable requisites in diff erent countries. In 50% of nations, additional tests are required. Hypothermia (4%), anoxic injury (7%), inability to complete clinical examination (61%), toxic drug levels (57%), and inconclusive apnea test (54%) are legal indications to perform additional tests. Cerebral blood fl ow investigation is mandatory in 18% of countries, while it is either optional or used only in selected cases in 82%. Conventional angiography is still the preferred method (50%), followed by transcranial Doppler (43%), angioCT (39%), CT perfusion and angioMR (11%). EEG is always (21%) or optionally (14%) recorded. Russia and Croatia evaluate both EEG and cerebral blood fl ow (7%). Conclusion There are still areas of uncertainty and disparities in brain death diagnosis in European countries. This predisposes to misdiagnosis and confusion both for clinicians and families. Measures to promote uniformity of brain death procedures and clinical practice are therefore desirable.",

We aimed to determine acute and long-term outcomes and costs of ICU-acquired weakness among long-stay (\u22658 days) ICU patients and to assess the impact of recovery of weakness at ICU discharge. Methods Data were prospectively collected during an RCT (Clinical trials.gov: NCT00512122) [1, 2] . Impact of weakness (MRC sum <48) on outcomes and costs was analyzed with 1:1 propensity score-matching for baseline characteristics, illness severity and risk factor exposure prior to assessment. Among weak patients, impact of persisting weakness at ICU discharge on risk of death after 1 year was examined with multivariable Cox proportional-hazard analysis.

Earlier attempts at clinical application of cerebral NIRS demonstrated that further work was needed [1] . The basic layout of the probe portion of these devices consists of a light source and a light detector, arranged at calculated distances and confi gurations in order to observe target tissue. We aim to determine which commercially available NIRS probe represents the most sensitive layout of sources/detectors for the greatest sensitivity in observing tissue oxygenation at the optimal depth for TBI. Methods The optimal depth for grey matter target tissue (grey-white matter junction) was ascertained by reviewing a series of brain CT scans of patients who had sustained a TBI. Set (average) measurements were derived from these identifying the target depth of the grey matter strip from the point of probe placement. Currently there are fi ve commercially available cerebral NIRS systems. Table 1 presents the variety of confi gurations off ered by each device. Source detector layouts were modelled and simulated using the NIRFAST\u00ae computational light modelling software (developed at the University of Birmingham) [2] .

Gastrointestinal dysfunction is the most common complication due to mucosal ischemia, motility disorders, and disruption of the gut barrier, with severe consequences: malnutrition, weight loss, and high risk of infections [1] . Therefore, maintaining the intestinal barrier function is a systematic engineering project. Selected new probiotics due to the capacity to bind and neutralize toxins, and to interfere with pathogen adherence, by immunomodulatory properties, mopping up the infection, could improve recovery of critically ill patients [2] . Our aim was to assess the eff ects of a new probiotic in an early enteral regimen on clinical outcome of severe TBI patients, in terms of VAP incidence, tolerance to enteral nutrition, duration of mechanical ventilation, and mortality rate. Methods A prospective randomized 1-year study of 64 patients 19 to 78 years old allocated to receive for 10 days either an early enteral diet plus a new probiotic (Bioent; Lactobacillus bulgaricus 10 trillion CFU/cp + activated charcoal) every 6 hours (Group A) or the same formula without probiotics (Group B). The diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous, and there were no diff erences between groups in gender, age, and nutritional status. We assessed the VAP incidence, duration of mechanical ventilation, tolerance to enteral nutrition, length of ICU stay, duration of diarrhea episodes, and mortality rate. The ANOVA test and t test were carried out; P <0.05 was considered signifi cant. Results The infection rate was higher in group B, the duration of mechanical ventilation was shorter in group A, and the patients in group A received 91.7% of total caloric needs by an enteral route versus 74.68% in group B. There is a signifi cant diff erence in the number of diarrhea episodes, and the ICU length of stay was signifi cantly lower in group A; there was no signifi cant diff erence in the mortality rate between groups.

The IMPACT and the APACHE II were found to identify slightly diff erent groups of patients that eventually do not survive (Figure 1 ). Conclusion The IMPACT and the APACHE II models showed equal performance for 6-month mortality prediction. A moderately strong, positive correlation, with some major discrepancies between the models, was found. Thus, features of both the IMPACT and APACHE II models are valuable for optimal outcome prediction in patients with TBI treated in the ICU. References demographic profi les of severe TBI in the local context, with implications in the management of severe TBI, particularly the utilisation of critical care resources. Results A total of 780 patients were admitted with TBI during the study period, of which 365 patients (46.8%) sustained severe TBI. The majority (75.3%) of the severe TBI patients were male. There was a bimodal preponderance of severe TBI cases in young adults (age 21 to 40) and older people (age >61). Motor vehicle accidents (48.8%) and falls from <2 m (35.1%) were the main mechanisms of injury. Invasive monitoring was frequently employed in these patients with severe TBI: arterial blood pressure monitoring in 298 patients (81.6%), central venous pressure monitoring in 219 patients (60.0%), and intracranial pressure monitoring in 173 patients (47.4%). The incidence of use of tiered therapy such as sedation, mild hyperventilation, osmotherapy with mannitol, cerebrospinal fl uid drainage, barbiturate coma and decompressive craniectomy to control ICP converged with international practices. Conclusion Young adults and older people involved mainly in motor vehicle accidents and falls respectively were among the high-risk groups for severe TBI. Management of these patients goes beyond the ICU and involves, but is not limited to, social support, emotional motivation and community reintegration of these patients [2] . TBI among the high-risk groups is largely preventable. Public awareness and prevention programmes will go some way in reducing the incidence of TBI amongst the high-risk groups.",

Introduction Antiseizure prophylaxis is recommended for preventing only early post-traumatic seizures (PTS) in the guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) by the Brain Trauma Foundation. Phenytoin is recommended to reduce the incidence of early PTS prophylaxis. Early enteral nutrition has recently shown theoretical advantages for prevention of bacterial translocation to maintain normal turnover of gut mucosa and is commonly used for TBI patients. Our hypothesis is that the enteral administration of antiepileptic agents is also useful for early PTS. Methods This retrospective observational study included all adult patients admitted to our tertiary academic medico-surgical ICU due to TBI from September 2011 to August 2012. Patients who have epilepsy as a past history were excluded. Clinical data were collected from electrical medical archives. The baseline characteristics collected were age, gender, diagnosis, antiepileptic agents, timing of start and adverse eff ects of those agents, and methods of administration.

A total of 120 students without prior CPR training were recruited from upper secondary school, during regular class hours, and randomly assigned to the t-CPR group (n = 60) versus the v-CPR group (n = 60). The Resusci\u00aeAnne SkillReporter\u2122 manikin was used to evaluate CPR performance. Data were transferred from the manikin into a computerized database using the Laerdal SkillReporting System V.2.2.1 software. Further analysis was based on audio-recordings and video-recordings. Primary outcome measures were the results of the Cardiff evaluation test; the secondary measures were global scoring of a complete 7-minute period of CPR. Results The mean chest compression rate increased signifi cantly in the v-CPR group as compared with t-CPR (110 \u00b1 16 vs. 86 \u00b1 28; P <0.0001), while depth remained constant (48 \u00b1 13 mm vs. 47 \u00b1 16 mm, P = NS). Hand positioning was correct in 91.7% of cases with v-CPR, but only in 68% with t-CPR (P = 0.001). The hands-off period was almost nonexistent in the v-CPR group (0 vs. 7 seconds; P = 0.0016), but the median no-fl ow time was signifi cantly greater in the v-CPR group (146 vs. 122 seconds, P < 0.0001). As a consequence, global evaluation of CPR performance revealed a signifi cant improvement in v-CPR group score as compared with the t-CPR group (6 vs. 5, P < 0.001). Conclusion Video-assisted CPR using this original algorithm allows bystanders to reach compression rates and depths close to international guidelines and to reduce hands-off events during CPR.",

Although a major complication of this procedure is bleeding, the optimal heparin dose and activated coagulation time (ACT) remain unknown. Methods We retrospectively evaluated the initial heparin doses, ACT values, and complications of patients who received ECPR between February 2011 and November 2013 at the Emergency and Critical Care Center, Mie University Hospital, Japan. Results ECPR was performed in 45 patients, and the ACT was evaluated in 32 patients. All patients were administered 3,000 U unfractionated heparin at the time of priming the circuit. Patients for whom cannulation took a longer time received an additional 2,000 to 3,000 U unfractionated heparin. The average heparin dose administered was 53.6 U/kg body weight. The average ACT was 231.3 seconds. In 17 of the 32 patients, the ACT exceeded 200 seconds. Three patients experienced fatal bleeding in the chest wall, which could not be stabilized by conservative treatment. One patient developed a cerebral infarction. There were no signifi cant diff erences between the patients with fatal bleeding and those without fatal bleeding with regard to the heparin dose, ACT, and duration of CPR. Conclusion According to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization guidelines, the target ACT should be around 1.5 times the normal ACT. However, it is diffi cult to obtain the normal ACT in emergency situations. Many of our patients' ACTs exceeded 200 seconds, and three patients experienced fatal bleeding that was possibly due to chest compression. Post-cardiac arrest patients often experience coagulopathy due to either cardiac arrest or hypothermia therapy. Therefore, an anticoagulation protocol other than the pulmonary extracorporeal membrane oxygenation protocol is required for ECPR patients. We evaluated our anticoagulation protocol for ECPR and observed that our patients' ACTs frequently exceeded the target value and some experienced fatal bleeding. The anticoagulation protocol for post-CPR patients may need to be reconsidered. Introduction Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) causes 60,000 UK and 300,000 US deaths each year. Survival to hospital discharge in the developed world has historically been 7 to 10% with obvious cognitive impairment in 10% of survivors. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and targeted temperature management (TTM) (or at least hyperthermia avoidance) have been shown to improve survival in comatose patients post OOHCA. There is no reliable method to predict poor outcome on presentation. We aimed to identify factors associated with poor outcome in our single-centre regional referral OOHCA population. Methods We performed a pragmatic single-centre retrospective review over 18 months commencing 1 January 2011 of all patients admitted to our regional OOHCA centre ICU following successful resuscitation from OOHCA. In keeping with guidelines, all patients were assessed for suitability for PPCI and TTM. A good outcome was defi ned by a Pittsburgh Cognitive Performance Category (CPC) score of 1 to 2 (independence, mild impairment) on hospital discharge. A poor outcome was defi ned as death or CPC 3 to 4 (moderate to severe impairment, coma) on hospital discharge. CPC scoring was determined Presenting base defi cit (mmol/l) -7.9 \u00b1 6.2 -13.8 \u00b1 5.9 -11.5 \u00b1 6.7 <0.001",

It looked specifi cally at the recognition of the acutely unwell, the interventions made, the decisions taken from admission through to the post-arrest period and the outcomes following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The audit aims to guide future improvements in preventing cardiac arrest and enhancing end-of-life care decision-making. Methods Medical notes of adult patients suff ering IHCA, over a 1-year period, were identifi ed and data were collected using a validated NCEPOD audit tool. These data included patient demographics, initial clerking and consultant review, patient care during the 48 hours prior to cardiac arrest, the resuscitation status of the patient, the resuscitation attempt, the post-cardiac arrest care and survival to discharge rates. Results Medical notes were available for assessment for 69 out of the 82 patients that were identifi ed as having IHCA between 1 October 2011 and 30 September 2012. The frequency of IHCA showed no correlation to day of the week or month. Initial clerking was incomplete in historytaking (16% vs. 14% in NCEPOD) and in examination (46% vs. 24% in NCEPOD). The majority of patients were appropriately escalated in a timely fashion (94% vs. 82% in NCEPOD), but fi rst consultant review was delayed beyond 12 hours in 49% of cases (48% in NCEPOD). A total 81% of patients suff ered cardiac arrest 24 hours after admission (68% in NCEPOD). Warning signs for cardiac arrest were considered present in 59% of cases (75% in NCEPOD), with a signifi cant proportion going unrecognised (27%) despite multiple medical reviews. Out-ofhours CPR attempts (68% vs. 59% in NCEPOD) seemed be associated with poorer survival. The survival to discharge rate after in-hospital cardiac arrest was 10.1%. This compares with 14.6% in the NCEPOD data and 20% in larger studies [2] . Ninety per cent of patients had no documentation of resuscitation status (78% in NCEPOD).",

The majority of health staff (81.5%) had never implemented TH. A total 45.8% of respondents stated that the main reasons for not using TH were the lack of information and training about the method, the lack of nursing staff , the lack of available cooling methods and the required time. The most common methods of application were cold packs and intravenous fl uids. Only 30.2% of the doctors and 5.5% of the nurses (P <0.001) actually had the knowledge to implement TH, and this was demonstrated by correct answers. Of the respondents who answered that they did know the method, only 23.9% answered correctly; about the target temperature, the maintenance and rewarming phase. A total 59.1% of doctors, despite having attended the Advanced Cardiac Life Support seminar, were not able to answer correctly the knowledge questions. Continuous education of health professionals and the existence of a protocol were proposed by 65% of participants as the best way of increasing knowledge and adherence with ERC guidelines about TH. Conclusion Therapeutic hypothermia is rarely used in Greek hospitals. The level of knowledge is mainly related to the lack of education and the lack of information about new techniques.

Sixteen shivering events were monitored with calorimetry among the 12 patients. The average rate of energy expenditure (without shivering) leading up to and following paralytic treatment was 1,425 kcal/hour (\u00b1 489 kcal/ hour) and 1,386 kcal/hour (\u00b1 235 kcal/hour). This was signifi cantly greater than the predicted basal energy expenditure (1,089 \u00b1 222 kcal; P = 0.007 and P <0.001). Time from a change in baseline energy expenditure to recognition and treatment of clinical shivering was 57 (\u00b1 64) minutes, and from treatment with neuromuscular blockade to baseline energy expenditure was 30 (\u00b1 20) minutes. This accounts for a total diff erence of 15,223 kcal (\u00b1 10,997 kcal) before treatment and 7,113 kcal (\u00b1 3,706 kcal) after treatment for each shivering episode compared with baseline (P = 0.01 and P = 0.003).

Subclinical shivering is associated with increased energy expenditure.

Instituting TH is recommended following the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for many patients who survive a cardiac arrest [1, 2] .

Methods We conducted a chart review of all patients admitted to the Department of Critical Care (DCC) at our hospital following cardiac arrest over 2 years in 2010 to 2012 (Group 1). We recorded compliance with key recommendations produced by the Royal College of Anaesthetists [4] although we defi ned post-ROSC hyperthermia as >37.2\u00b0C rather than >38\u00b0C. A TH protocol was designed and personnel in the emergency department and DCC educated as to its use. Recommended practice was the infusion of cold i.v. normal saline (1 to 2 l) followed by the use of an intravascular cooling device (Alsius CoolGard\u2122). Data collection was then undertaken after introduction of the protocol for all patients admitted to the DCC following cardiac arrest in November 2012 to 2013 (Group 2). Results Forty-three patients were admitted in Group 1, 28 in Group 2. Of these, 42% in both groups were following out-of-hospital (OOH) VF arrests.

Through fever prevention, both oxygen utilization and caloric expenditure are reduced, so metabolic effi ciency can be maximized [1] . However, patient cooling is not without consequences and shivering is experienced by more than 70% of patients achieving TTM. Because shivering triggers an increase in metabolic demand, causing additional oxygen consumption and the promotion of catabolism, its prevention is ideal [2] . We set out to review the data surrounding the anti-shivering component of a normothermia protocol in the surgical ICU (SICU) of one Minnesota hospital. Methods A retrospective review was conducted looking at SICU patients managed with a normothermia protocol, with particular attention paid to the anti-shivering portion of the protocol. Serum magnesium (Mg) levels were assessed prior to initiation of TTM and Bedside Shivering Assessment Scale (BSAS) scores were collected. Results Twenty patients receiving TTM for TBI were evaluated (March to October 2013). One-half of the patients maintained targeted BSAS scores <1 for the full duration of TTM (n = 10 of 20). Serum Mg levels at the initiation of TTM were observed to negatively correlate with the level of shivering, as indicated by the BSAS scoring system (P = 0.02). See Figure 1 .",

Current SICU practices provide a similar Mg loading dose for all patients, regardless of baseline Mg levels. In our observed patients, achieving a baseline serum Mg level >2 was associated with lower shivering scores throughout the TTM course. This supports the hypothesis that serum Mg concentrations prior to TTM are important predictors of shivering reduction, and suggests that loading doses of Mg should be tailored to the individual patient to achieve such levels.",

However, prior studies showed that resuscitation with L/R was associated with more kidney damage in rats with severe hemorrhagic shock. The direct eff ects of L/R on human renal tubule cells have not been reported. Methods Human proximal renal tubular cell line HK-2 was used. Viability was examined by MTT assay. An additional equal volume of phosphatebuff ered saline (PBS) served as control. Addition of 200 nM dipyridyl and 1 mM H 2 O 2 served as conditions of hypoxia and oxidative stress, respectively.

The DLET is divided into an upper channel, for placement of a fi beroptic bronchoscope (FOB), and a lower channel exclusively dedicated to the patient's ventilation. The aim of this study is to achieve an in vitro and an in vivo evaluation of PT performed with the DLET. Methods The nonlinear constant of the Rohrer equation (K 2 ) was calculated as resistive properties, during a continuous fl ow of 10 to 90 l/minute, for a conventional endotracheal tube (ETT) with and without FOB (ETT size 7, 7.5, 8, 7f, 7.5f, 8f ), ventilation tube of TLT (F4 and F5) and DLET.

We want to evaluate the eff ectiveness of noncontrast abdominal MDCT in the emergency department.Introduction Fever is a common problem in adults visiting the emergency department (ED)[1]. Although it is important to treat the cause of fever, symptomatic management of fever is also necessary. Multiple studies are available on the effi cacy of various antipyretics in children, but very little has been done in adults[1,2]. Hence we aimed to compare the antipyretic effi cacy of intravenous (i.v.) paracetamol and intramuscular (i.m.) diclofenac in adult patients presenting with fever to the ED. Methods In this parallel-group, open-label trial, participants aged 14 to 75 years who had a temperature more than 38.5\u00b0C were enrolled and treated in the ED, Alkhor, Hamad Medical Corporation, during the Conclusion Both i.m. diclofenac and i.v. paracetamol showed signifi cant antipyretic activity, with diclofenac having a greater eff ect. In view of ease of administration, i.m. diclofenac can be used as a fi rst-choice antipyretic in febrile adults in the ED. References Introduction A pragmatic survey of shock management in Thai physicians is unavailable. The objective of this study is to identify shock management patterns for severe sepsis and septic shock in Thailand. Methods Two thousand questionnaires were sent to physicians involved in caring for shock patients across Thailand. The frequency scale was defi ned as fi ve levels by patient proportion estimation at routine practice. Results Between April and August 2013, a total of 533 questionnaires (26.7%) were returned. For severe sepsis and septic shock management, a total of 406 physicians (76.2%) reported their routine usage of quantitative resuscitation protocols. Urine output, mean arterial pressure and central venous pressure are more frequently used than central venous oxygen saturation and lactate as the resuscitation endpoint. Nearly 80% of these had an 'often and always' resuscitation CVP) and fl uid challenge test were more frequently used for preload evaluation than new fl uid responsiveness methods. Less than 15% still used a pulmonary artery catheter in their routine practice. Conclusion Most physicians manage shock with protocols.",

The there was no statistical signifi cance in diff erence in in-hospital cardiac arrest incidence and overall hospital mortality rate. Since the introduction of the ERT service in our hospital, we have conducted a continuous educational campaign to improve awareness in an attempt to increase use of the service. Methods To investigate the outcome of the ERT system in in-hospital cardiac arrest and the overall hospital mortality rate, we conducted a prospective, controlled before and after examination of the longterm eff ect of an ERT system on the incidence of cardiac arrest. We performed chi-square analysis to fi nd statistical signifi cance.

We also found an inverse association between number of ERT use and the risk of occurrence of cardiac arrests, but we found no diff erence in overall hospital mortality rate.

Since then, popularity of this imaging modality has increased due to a number of reasons: a sensitivity of 94 to 97%, a specifi city of 96 to 99%, lack of intravenous contrast injection and speed of examination. The UK College of Emergency Medicine considers CT KUB as best practice for radiological investigation of renal colic. A review of the literature suggests that the true positive rate (number of patients diagnosed with an obstructing or symptom causing calculus) should be between 47.5 and 67% and alternative diagnoses should be confi rmed in approximately 10% of patients imaged[2]. Conclusion The true positive rate of CT KUB for renal colic has decreased signifi cantly. We are getting more negative scan results and more scans diagnosing other signifi cant pathology. The authors believe clinicians' thresholds for imaging may have decreased due to the apparent lowdose radiation of CT KUBs. Furthermore, there is a perceived ease of access to CT KUB imaging and hence this modality appears to be being used to identify other signifi cant pathology. References",

A simulated patient had a peripheral intravenous cannula, central venous catheter and brachial arterial cannula. Atropine was available on request. A laboratory controlled trial compared a transmission of bacteria through standard arterial ports against the NIC when attached to an arterial sampling hub. The colonization rates were compared using a two-tailed Fisher's exact test. A closed-circuit arterial sampling system was designed. A contaminated syringe tip was inserted into the conventional arterial hub or the NIC to take an arterial sample. Transducer fl ush fl uid fl owing to the patient bloodstream was cultured. In a survey the nursing staff were asked questions regarding the NIC system, including its manual handling, sampling of the blood and its durability. Eighty-fi ve per cent (17/20) of samples in the standard arterial group showed onward transmission of pathogens to the patient circulation, and none of the patient samples taken from the NIC group were contaminated (0/20), P <0.0001. In the survey, 80% of the nurses found manual handling of a new device equally simple and 20% even simpler. Sampling of the blood was equally challenging for 87% participants. Ninety-four per cent found similar durability of the new device and better protection against accidental intra-arterial injection. Sixty-six per cent of the nursing staff would replace the standard system with a NIC. Conclusion Most of the doctors would inject the drug intra-arterially. Currently, no other device is available to eliminate accidental intraarterial injection or bacterial transmission. The nursing staff found the management of the NIC equally challenging.

The aim of this prospective clinical study was to study platelet function in intensive care patients using point-of-care viscoelastic and platelet aggregometry instruments and platelet count (PLC). Our hypothesis was that measurement of platelet function would give more information about disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), morbidity and mortality than PLC alone. Methods Patients admitted to the ICU were monitored with ROTEM viscoelasticity and a new Multiplate platelet aggregometer; routine coagulation analyses; International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis and Japanese Association for Acute Medicine DIC calculated scores; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, Simplifi ed Acute Physiology Score III -Expected Mortality Rate; and real in-hospital mortality. Nonparametric tests were chosen for all statistical evaluation. P <0.05 was considered signifi cant. Results A total of 128 patients with diff erent diagnoses were studied, with 330 sampling events. Multiplate analyses correlated signifi cantly with PLC and ROTEM. However, there were more test results below normal limits for Multiplate analyses than for ROTEM in patients with thrombocytopenia. Multiplate, ROTEM and PLC results were low in patients with high SOFA scores and in patients with overt DIC scores. These test results at admission to the ICU did not diff er between survivors and nonsurvivors, and did not correlate with the length of stay in the ICU. Only EMR diff ered between survivors and nonsurvivors and correlated with ICU length of stay. Conclusion In this study, Multiplate and ROTEM did not provide any more information than PLC about DIC, morbidity and mortality. Multiplate showed lower platelet function in more patients with low platelets than ROTEM. In patients without thrombocytopenia, all patients had normal ROTEM results, but 36% of Multiplate measurements were low. This higher sensitivity of the Multiplate to measure lowered platelet function needs to be linked to real bleeding in larger patient series to defi ne its clinical signifi cance. a poor evidence base for this practice[1]. There is a relatively better evidence base for prophylactic platelet transfusion[2]  but clinical practice is inconsistent. Through a retrospective study we aimed to establish the thresholds triggering use of FFP and platelet transfusion prior to percutaneous drain insertion in critical care patients. Conclusion This study demonstrates inconsistent use of FFP, with no signifi cant diff erence in PT between patients who were transfused and those that were not.

Increasing plasma fHb levels after transfusion were associated with decreased microvascular density and lower increase in tissue Hb content. This relation might be blunted when the glycocalyx is preserved. References years served as control. There were also analyzed blood plasma and fragments of artery luminal part from patients who died from diff erent causes. Analysis of FA was conducted using capillary gas-liquid chromatography. Quantitative evaluation of individual FA content was made as a mass percentage of their total. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test (P <0.05). Results Normalized contents of oleic and palmitoleic monounsaturated FA increase in patients with MODS, while the levels of stearic saturated FA and polyunsaturated FA decrease, as compared with the control. Considering these results, we conclude that blood plasma FA composition in MODS biased towards composition of FA characteristic of adipose and muscle tissue triglycerides, which quantitatively predominant monounsaturated FA, and stearic and polyunsaturated FA have a signifi cantly lower level[1,2]. Thus, the composition of the FA in MODS refl ects the degree of lipolysis activation in fat depots. As a result of these processes there should occur an imbalance in vascular endothelial cells between monounsaturated and polyunsaturated FA and, as a consequence, changes in metabolism of eicosanoids and other lipid vasoactive mediators should develop. One should note that in plasma of people who died in a hospital environment due to various reasons, similar changes in FA blood composition are observed. The degree of change of FA composition in postmortem blood samples presumably primarily depends on severity and duration of a previous critical and serious condition. Postmortem changes presumably exert some infl uence on blood plasma FA composition. Moreover, the composition of FA in blood plasma in the case of MODS is similar to that of FA in the luminal part of the artery wall. This suggests a decrease in the infl uence of intertissue diff erences in lipid composition on metabolic processes. Conclusion Given that the monounsaturated FAs in the case of MODS enter the bloodstream primarily from adipose and muscle tissues, one can assume that their blood plasma level refl ects the degree of hypermetabolism processes in the organism.

Single beat (Sb) measurements of ventriculoarterial coupling (VAc) can be used by the intensivist when dealing with altered hemodynamic states[1]. LV elastance (Ees) and arterial elastance (Ea) can be measured by trasthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in a Sb fashion[2], so allowing quick assessment of VAc. PEEP application is common practice in the ICU but can have hemodynamic consequences and lead to instability. Speckle tracking analysis by TTE has been recently reported to help titrating PEEP in critically ill patients[3]. However, this can be demanding and require specifi c ultrasound tools. In this study we aimed to assess whether standard TTE can be useful in evaluating the eff ect of respiratory treatment with PEEP on cardiovascular effi ciency by measuring VAc after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Methods TTE was performed before anesthesia induction and upon ICU arrival in 15 patients with preoperative diagnosis of LV dysfunction defi ned as an EF <35%. In-ICU measurements of Ees, Ea and VAc were taken at diff erent steps of PEEP application lasting 3 minutes as follows: 0 cmH2  O PEEP (ZEEP), 5 cmH 2 O PEEP, 10 cmH 2 O PEEP and 15 cmH 2 O PEEP. TTE and hemodynamic parameters were recorded and analyzed. Results All patients were uncoupled preoperatively (VAc >1.31, average VAc (AVAc) = 1.56) before anesthesia induction and showed worsened uncoupling postoperatively at ZEEP. PEEP application altered VAc by modifying both Ees and Ea at all steps and all patients showed further uncoupling at any level of PEEP application (AVAc at ZEEP = 1.97, at 5 cmH 2 O PEEP = 1.61, at 10 cmH 2 O PEEP = 1.87, at 15 cmH 2 O PEEP = 2.23) A PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O provided the more favorable VAc.Conclusion Sb evaluation of Ea/Ees shows that following CABG the patients with depressed LV remain uncoupled, and that in such patients the application of PEEP leads to further decoupling. In this preliminary experience, 5 cmH 2 O PEEP seems to be the most appropriate in preventing further worsening of the VAc. A large RCT is needed to draw conclusions on the PEEP eff ect on VAc following CABG in a depressed heart. References1. Guarracino F, et al.: Crit Care 2013, 17:213. 2.

The data of all patients admitted to the ICU at a university hospital with the diagnosis of SAP from January 2008 to December 2012 were abstracted from the hospital database. ARI was defi ned according to RIFLE criteria. Patients with any signs of renal impairment (serum creatinine value \u22651.5-fold from the estimated baseline) on admission or history of kidney disease were excluded. A control group was composed of randomly selected patients with SAP who did not develop ARI. Results Of 145 patients, 24 patients who developed ARI at any time during hospitalization (ARI group) were contrasted with 24 patients without ARI (control group). The patients were older in the ARI group: age 57 \u00b1 13 versus 49 \u00b1 16, P = 0.046. Although none of the patients in the ARI group had creatinine values \u22651.5-fold from the estimated baseline, the creatinine values on admission were higher in this group: 100 \u00b1 38 versus 68 \u00b1 16, P = 0.001. The severity of pancreatitis was similar. On admission, the APACHE II and SOFA scores were higher in the <0.05). The percentage of patients requiring vasopressors over 72 hours was greater in the ARI group: 66.7% versus 29.2%, P = 0.01. Positive fl uid balance after 72 hours in ICU was higher in the ARI group: 8,594 \u00b1 7,044 ml versus 4,192 \u00b1 4,467 ml, P = 0.004; however, the infused volume of crystalloids did not diff er between groups. Central venous pressure was higher on admission (P = 0.036) and after 72 hours (P = 0.001) in the ARI group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that development of ARI was independently associated with cardiovascular SOFA score after 72 hours: odds ratio = 1.475, 95% CI 1.049 to 2.073, P = 0.025. Conclusion The development of ARI in SAP was associated with hemodynamic instability, whereas excessive volume expansion does not prevent ARI.Introduction Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is associated with signifi cant mortality and morbidity. The objective of this study is to examine the profi le, outcome and resource utilization for patients with SAP admitted to the ICU in a university teaching hospital over a 5-year period. Methods A retrospective observational study was carried out of all patients admitted to the ICU from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012 with SAP. Data were collected from the ICU database (AcuBase), the medical records and the ICU clinical information system. Data collected included patient demographics, etiology of SAP, data for APACHE II, Imrie, Ranson and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) scores, and requirement for organ support. Outcomes recorded were length of stay, ICU mortality and hospital mortality. Cost of ICU care was calculated based on previously reported methodology. Results Thirty-eight eligible patients were identifi ed. Mean age was 51.4 years (range 24 to 86), 68% were male. The commonest etiologies were alcohol (53%) and gallstone pancreatitis (24%). The mean APACHE II score was 18.5 (IQR 14 to 23). Twenty-eight patients (74%) required mechanical ventilation, three of whom required high-frequency oscillation (all three survived). Twenty-two patients (58%) had evidence of an acute kidney injury on admission (AKIN criteria). Eighteen (47%) required renal replacement therapy and 60% required inotropes. The ICU mortality and the hospital mortality were 26%. There was no signifi cant diff erence in age, APACHE II, Imrie, or Ranson scores between survivors and nonsurvivors. The median length of stay in the ICU was 11 days (IQR 5.25 to 28.5) and the median hospital stay was 45.4 days (IQR 22.25 to 104.5). Nine patients (24%) required multiple ICU admissions and the mortality was signifi cantly higher in this group (P <0.05, chi-square test). In total, 834 ICU bed-days were taken up by 38 patients. Based on a median cost for an ICU bed-day of \u20ac2,205[1], the total cost of ICU care for these patients is estimated at \u20ac1,838,970 or almost \u20ac50,000 per patient.Conclusion A hospital mortality rate of 26% is similar to that reported recently from a specialist unit in the UK[2]  but less than the 42% reported in the UK in 2007[1], suggesting some improvement in recent years. SAP is associated with prolonged ICU and hospital stay and signifi cant resource utilization.References 1. Harrison et al.: Crit Care 2007, 11(Suppl 1):S1. 2.

Concerns exist that therapeutic hypothermia (TH) may increase the risk of infection, worsen coagulopathy and inhibit hepatic regeneration. We therefore reviewed the experience in use of TH in participating US Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG) centers. The aims were to determine utilization of TH in ALF patients at high risk for cerebral edema (grade III or IV hepatic encephalopathy (HE)) and to determine its eff ect on survival and complication rates. Methods A retrospective cohort study of all ALF patients enrolled in the US ALFSG registry between January 1998 and September 2013 with grade III or IV HE. TH using an external cooling device was used in 97 (8%) patients while in 1,135 (92%) patients it was not (controls). Results TH ALF patients were younger (36 vs. 40, P = 0.03) and had acetaminophen etiology (63 vs. 47%, P = 0.04). Admission MELD (32 vs. 34) and lactate (5.4 vs. 5.0 mmol/l, P >0.2 for all) were similar. More TH ALF patients received renal replacement therapy (63 vs. 40%), vasopressors (61 vs. 43%) and ICP monitoring (40 vs. 22%, P <0.0002 for all). Overall (38% vs. 40%, P = 0.7) and 21-day transplant survival (45 vs. 49%, P = 0.5) were similar. There were no diff erences in bleeding (12% vs. 12%) or bloodstream infections (17 vs. 18%, P >0.7 for both). More TH ALF patients had arrhythmias (38 vs. 27%, P = 0.03). There were no diff erences in listing (43 vs. 40%, P = 0.5) or receipt of transplant (18 vs. 25%, P = 0.1). After controlling for MELD, requirement for organ support on multivariable analysis, hypothermia was not independently <0.0001) and vasopressors (P <0.02) were. Conclusion TH was not associated with increased bleeding/infection rates nor diff erences in survival in ALF patients with high-grade HE. ICP monitoring was not universally used in TH ALF patients (~40%). There is a need for a prospective trial to clarify the use of TH in patients with ALF.

This study aimed to evaluate these patients' outcomes after transplant. Methods The retrospective cohort included 519 adult cirrhotic patients who underwent LT at one Canadian center between 2002 and 2012. Primary exposure was severity of end-stage liver disease measured by MELD score at transplant (\u226540 vs. <40)[2]. The primary outcome was duration of fi rst ICU stay after LT[3]. Secondary outcomes were duration of fi rst hospital stay after LT, rate of ICU readmission, re-transplant rate, and survival rates. Results On the day of LT, 5% (28/519) of patients had a MELD score \u226540. These patients had longer fi rst ICU stay after LT (14 vs. 2 days; P <0.001). MELD score \u226540 at transplant was independently associated with fi rst ICU stay after transplant \u226510 days (OR, 3.21). These patients had longer fi rst hospital stay after LT (45 vs. 18 days; P <0.001); however, there was no signifi cant diff erence in the rate of ICU readmission (18% vs. 22%; P = 0.58) or re-transplant rate (4% vs. 4%; P = 1.00). Cumulative survival at 1 month, 3 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years was 98%, 96%, 90%, 79%, and 72%, respectively. There was no signifi cant diff erence in cumulative survival stratifi ed by MELD score \u226540 versus <40 at transplant (P = 0.59). Conclusion Cirrhotic patients with MELD score \u226540 at transplant utilize greater postoperative health resources; however, they derive similar long-term survival benefi t with LT.References 1.

The aim of this study is to fi nd their causes and consequences in our ICU. Methods We studied 72 cirrhotic patients who were transplanted in our hospital during the years 2011 and 2012. The cases that developed intrahospital infection, its source and microbiology, the surgical complications, the function of the transplant, the duration of mechanical ventilation and their outcome were fully examined.Results Twenty patients (27.1%) developed 33 episodes of infection. Among them 35% suff ered from liver dysfunction, 40% took large doses of immunosuppression and 50% were re-operated. Five out of them showed signs of infection promptly after transplantation. Medium duration of mechanical ventilation was 16.5 \u00b1 12.75 days (vs. 3.24 \u00b1 5.5 of those without an infection) and medium length of stay was 22.14 \u00b1 18.35 days (vs. 6.79 \u00b1 8.86). The medium APACHE II score was 17.8 \u00b1 5.5 (vs. 16.4 \u00b1 4.37, P = 0.256) and medium SOFA was 11.32 \u00b1 2.62 (vs. 9.9 \u00b1 2.62, P = 0.054). The majority of patients was transfused with many blood units, FFP and cryoprecipitates and was hemodynamically unstable (56.3%). MELD score and MELD-Na were higher (22.57 and 27.5 relatively vs. 19.02 and 22.5). Eight cases had VAP from Gramnegative bacteria, 15 had bacteraemia (mainly Gram-negative, but also fungaemia), 10 had intraabdominal infection (most of them with two or three re-operations) and urine infection. The majority of pathogens were multidrug resistant. Regarding Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase, 60% was sensitive to colimycine, 20% to tobramycin, 70% to gentamycin and 40% to tygecycline. In four cases the donors had an infection that was transmitted to the recipient as much as 75%. Fourteen patients died (10 in ICU and four in the transplantation clinic) soon after with multiorgan failure. Conclusion Patients after liver transplantation with organ dysfunction and multiple transfusions, due to surgical complications, have a major risk of developing an infection inside the ICU that aff ects their survival.

As the level of SF refl ects the thrombin generation activity in plasma, we may estimate the early-activated state of blood coagulation by the measurement of SF. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical usefulness of SF for the hypercoagulated state. Methods We measured the plasma level of SF in 63 patients within 48 hours after admission and on the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th days after admission. Underlying disease mainly includes sepsis, shock, and so on. According to the disseminated intravascular coagulation diagnostic criteria established by the Japanese Association of Acute Medicine, we defi ned the DIC group as JAAM-DIC score more than 3 within 48 hours after admission, the Subclinical DIC group as score more than 3 within 7 days beyond 48 hours after admission, and the No DIC group as score less than 4 during the entire study period. The SF value of each group was compared with the Mann-Whitney U test.ResultsThe SF values in the DIC and the Subclinical DIC groups were signifi cantly higher than in the No DIC group. We created the receiver operating characteristic curve of SF value for DIC onset (JAAM-DIC score \u22654) and the SF value of 35 \u03bcg/ml was set as the cutoff SF value. The high SF group (SF \u226535 \u03bcg/ml) had signifi cantly higher JAAM-DIC score, SOFA score and APACHE II score than the low SF group (SF <35 \u03bcg/ml). Mainly in the high SF group except DIC patients on admission, we found that SF increased before the JAAM-DIC score changed. SeeFigures 1 and 2. Conclusion We think measurement of the plasma SF level may be clinically useful in evaluating the severity of critically ill patients such as those with sepsis.",

Microparticles (MPs) are submicron vesicles shed from a variety of cells that are considered to have proinfl ammatory and prothrombotic properties. Although plateletderived MPs (PDMPs) are the main form of MPs, the role of PDMPs in critically ill patients remains unclear[1]. The aims of this study were to investigate serum PDMP levels in critically ill patients and to assess their prognostic value. Methods This study comprised 119 critically ill patients who were admitted to the ICU. PDMPs were measured by ELISA three times a week, and 372 samples were obtained. We calculated both the mean PDMP value and the mean PDMP/platelet (PDMP/PLT) ratio (converted to plasma PDMP levels per 10 4 platelets) during the course of the ICU stay. Baseline patient data, including APACHE II score, SOFA score, Japanese Association for Acute Medicine DIC score, International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis overt DIC score, blood coagulation parameters, C-reactive protein and lactate, were collected at the time of admission to the ICU. The primary outcome was inhospital mortality. Potential predictors were analyzed for possible association with outcomes.ResultsThe mean PDMP/PLT ratio was signifi cantly diff erent when comparing hospital survivors (n = 98; median, 1.95) and nonsurvivors (n = 21; median 8.40; P = 0.00). The mean PDMP/PLT ratio was signifi cantly higher in patients with (median, 4.28) than in those without DIC (median, 1.57; P = 0.00). In DIC patients, the mean PDMP/ PLT ratio was signifi cantly higher in nonsurvivors (median, 9.39) than in survivors (median, 3.65; P = 0.02). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that both the mean PDMP/PLT ratio (P = 0.04) and APACHE II score (P = 0.00) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. The AUCs were calculated as 0.768 \u00b1 0.073 for the mean PDMP/PLT ratio (P = 0.00) and 0.811 \u00b1 0.048 for the APACHE II score (P = 0.00). Conclusion The PDMP/PLT ratio is a good predictor of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients, especially in patients with DIC.Reference 1.

Conclusion Our patients' EA levels were signifi cantly correlated with disease severity criteria and 28-day mortality of the patients. When the EA level and procalcitonin level were used concomitantly, disease severity could be assessed more precisely than when either marker was used alone.

The PSEP and PCT levels have been reported to be abnormally high in patients with chronic renal failure. However, there have been no signifi cant investigations regarding the relationships between these biomarkers and the presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the diagnosis of sepsis.The purpose of this study was to clarify the diagnostic accuracy of PSEP and PCT levels in patients with AKI. Methods This study was conducted as a single-center retrospective study. Blood samples were collected from patients immediately after admission to the Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Fukuoka University Hospital between June 2010 and August 2013. We enrolled 629 patients in whom both the PSEP and PCT levels were measured on admission. We classifi ed the patients into two groups according to the RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function and End-stage kidney disease: Loss and ESKD): the AKI group and the non-AKI group. The patients in the AKI group were further classifi ed into the sepsis group and the nonsepsis group according to each stage of AKI. We subsequently investigated the diagnostic accuracy of the PSEP and PCT levels for detecting sepsis in these groups. Results We evaluated 254 patients with AKI and 375 patients without AKI. The AKI group included 103 patients who met the Risk criteria, 65 who met the Injury criteria, 66 who met the Failure criteria and 18 who met the Loss and ESKD criteria. The mean PSEP and PCT levels were signifi cantly higher in the sepsis group than in the nonsepsis group among the non-AKI patients and those meeting the Risk, Injury and Failure criteria (P <0.01). The diagnostic accuracy of the PSEP and PCT levels for detecting sepsis was determined according to a ROC analysis; the area under the curve (AUC) for the PSEP and PCT levels was 0.883 and 0.870, respectively, in the non-AKI group. In addition, the AUC values for the PSEP and PCT levels in the Risk, Injury and Introduction Diff erentiation of sepsis from non-infectious SIRS is important in improving sepsis outcome. We intended in this study to evaluate the role of serum leptin and to compare it with CRP in diff erentiating sepsis from non-infectious SIRS. Methods We included 30 patients with SIRS. According to the presence or absence of infection, our patients were classifi ed into the SIRS group and the sepsis group. Leptin and CRP were evaluated in all patients on admission, day 2 and day 4.",

Methods A retrospective single-centre study in a tertiary referral institution. Continuous venovenous haemodiafi ltration (CVVHDF) was administered according to the patient's IBW. The delivered UF rate was then calculated both for IBW and E/ABW. The latter was based on measurements obtained at the time of ICU admission. We compared the highest predilution, postdilution and dialysate volume administered each day according to the diff erent weight estimate measurements respectively. Student's t tests and chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis (P <0.05). Results Data from 33 patients receiving renal replacement therapy were analysed. Mean time (\u00b1 SD) of treatment interruption was 1.4 \u00b1 2.7 hours/day due to fi lter changes, transfers for CT scans and surgical procedures. Therefore, 94% of the prescribed dose was delivered. There was a mean of 2.3 fi ltration dose prescriptions per patient over the observation period (due to changing clinical conditions), with a total of 77 dose adaptations. Mean E/ABW was signifi cantly higher than calculated IBW (76.3 kg vs. 61.4 kg), and thus a diff erence of 14.9 kg (95% CI = 9.2 to 20.6 kg). This resulted in a signifi cant diff erence in mean fi ltration dose delivered of 33.1 ml/kg/ hour for E/ABW versus 39.7 ml/kg/hour for IBW respectively (P <0.001). As a consequence, in 29.6% (8/27) of cases where HVHDF (>35 ml/kg/ hour) was prescribed, standard volume haemodiafi ltration (SVHDF) (\u226435 ml/kg/hour) was delivered. In 10% (5/50) of cases where SVHDF was prescribed, HVHDF was delivered (P <0.001). Conclusion We conclude that the delivered UF rate in our cohort of patients diff ered signifi cantly depending on measured or calculated body weight. In almost one-third of cases where HVHDF was prescribed, SVHDF was delivered. As many interventions in the ICU are based on IBW and daily weighing of patients is not uniformly practiced, this makes comparison of data diffi cult. References Introduction Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) with need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). AKI-RRT is associated with important short-term mortality, and recent data showed there is also important increased risk for 1-year mortality. The aim of this study is to evaluate variables associated with 1-year survival, and in particular the impact of baseline CKD in a cohort of AKI-RRT patients. Methods A single-center observational study in a 50-bed ICU tertiary care hospital. During the study period August 2004 to December 2012, all consecutive adult AKI-RRT patients were included. Data were retrieved from the electronic ICU patient fi le, the electronic hospital patient fi le and the electronic ICU-RRT database. Long-term outcome data were collected by a telephone survey. Results During the 9-year study period, a total of 1,291 AKI-RRT patients were included. Short-term mortality at day 30 was 47.2%; mortality at 1 year was 64.3%. Compared with nonsurvivors, 1-year survivors had similar age (65 vs. 67 years, P = 0.077), worse kidney function at baseline (eGFR 46 vs. 52 ml/minute/1.73 m 2 , P = 0.001; CKD stage \u22653 65% vs. 58%, P = 0.019), a greater proportion was male (69.0% vs. 63.2%, P = 0.048), and more were admitted to the cardiac surgery ICU (39% vs. 46%, P = 0.012). They were less severely ill as illustrated by lower SAPS 2 score at ICU admission (52 vs. 69, P <0.001), and at the time of initiation of RRT, and a lower SOFA score (9 vs. 11; P <0.001). A smaller proportion was on mechanical ventilation (85.1% vs. 89.7%, P = 0.042) and on vasoactive drugs (45.7% vs. 63.9%, P <0.001). Survivors had earlier initiation of RRT (2 vs. 3 days, P = 0.034), and more frequently intermittent RRT was used (84.8% vs. 63.2%; P <0.001). When corrected for gender, age, severity of illness, and modality and timing of RRT, worse baseline kidney function, defi ned as CKD stage \u22653, remained associated with better 1-year survival (odds ratio 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.2, P = 0.011). Conclusion In ICU patients who had AKI-RRT, 1-year survival was associated with lower severity of illness. Surprisingly, worse kidney function or CKD stage \u22653 was also associated with long-term survival. This eff ect remained present after adjudication for relevant covariates.Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT) in ICU patients is associated with high mortality, chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR <60 ml/minute/1.73 m 2 , or CKD stage \u22653) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Data on long-term outcomes vary among studies due to diff erences in age, CKD, severity of illness, RRT modality and timing of initiation of RRT. Long-term patient and kidney outcomes in AKI-RRT patients were evaluated in this study. Methods A retrospective study of all consecutive treated AKI-RRT patients in a 50-bed ICU academic hospital from August 2004 to December 2012. Data were retrieved from the electronic ICU, RRT and hospital patient fi les. Long-term outcomes data were obtained by a telephone survey. Results During the study period 1,291 ICU patients were treated with RRT for AKI. Mortality was 47.2% at day 30 and 57.2% at hospital discharge. Mortality in hospital survivors showed an important increase until 3-year follow-up, and a moderate increase later (1 year: 14.4%, 2 years: 20%, 3 years: 35.7%, and 7 years: 39%).

A total 43.1% of patients with CKD stage <3 at baseline had an increase to CKD stage \u22653 at 1 year. A total 26.6% of patients with CKD stage \u22653 at baseline decreased to CKD stage <3. A total of 8.3% of hospital survivors developed ESKD. Patients with increase of CKD stage had similar age (67 vs. 64 years, P = 0.145), SAPS 2 (57 vs. 51, P = 0.858), and SOFA score (9 vs. 9, P = 0.275) compared with patients with stable or decreased CKD stage. There were no diff erences in type of ICU, modality of RRT, or number of patients treated with vasopressors (44% vs. 47%, P = 0.617) or invasive ventilation (84% vs. 81%, P = 0.496). However, these patients were more probably male (76.9% vs. 65.6%, P = 0.042), had lower Scr at baseline (1.1 vs. 1.7 mg/dl, P <0.001) and at ICU admission (1.7 vs. 2.4 mg/dl, P <0.001), and were started on RRT later (3 vs. 2 days, P = 0.008). Conclusion The annual mortality in AKI-RRT hospital survivors is approximately 10% per year during the fi rst 3 years of follow-up. Onethird of patients had an increase of CKD stage at 1 year of follow-up and almost one-half of patients who had eGFR >60 ml/minute/1.73 m 2 developed CKD. Patients who had an increase of CKD had similar severity of illness, but lower Scr at baseline and at ICU admission, and had later initiation of RRT compared with patients who had stable or decreased CKD stage.P407Polymyxin B-immobilized fi ber hemoperfusion therapy improves sepsis-related immunosuppressionA Kimura, S Ono, S Hiraki, R Takahata, H Tsujimoto, M Kinoshita, S Aosasa, K Hatsuse, D Saitoh, K Hase, J Yamamoto National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan Critical Care 2014, 18(Suppl 1):P407 (doi: 10.1186/cc13597)",

The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of extracorporeal endotoxin removal with polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) (Toraymyxin\u00ae). Methods All patients admitted to our ICU between 1 April 2011 and 30 June 2013 who developed SS&SSh and underwent endotoxin activity assay (EAA) measurement were retrospectively evaluated. Results During the study period, EAA was dosed in 100 patients. Eightyone patients were aff ected by septic shock. The source of infection was identifi ed in 70.4% of cases (45% abdominal) and the percentage of microbiologically confi rmed episodes was 77% (81% Gram-negatives). The mortality rate was 49%.

Multivariate analysis for ICU mortality risk factorsConclusion EAA is a rapid and reliable method to identify patients who may be treated with polymyxin B hemoperfusion. Source control and extracorporeal endotoxin removal have appeared as two eff ective interventions that should be implemented in the early management of patients with SS&SSh. Reference consisted of the following components: daily spontaneous awakening trials (SATs); daily spontaneous breathing trials coordinated with the SATs; delirium monitoring; and early mobility. The study's primary endpoint was the cost-eff ectiveness of the ABCDE bundle in terms of the bundle's cost to prevent 1 day of mechanical ventilation (MV) or 1 day of delirium for all patients, as well as for a subgroup of non-MV patients. All cost-eff ectiveness ratios (CERs) were constructed from the hospital's cost perspective. The economic analyses were carried out in two steps. First, the mean cost per patient per hospital stay and total costs in the pre-ABCDE and post-ABCDE bundle periods were compared. Next, CERs of each respective primary endpoint were computed as incremental costs of implementing the bundle to prevent 1 day of MV and to prevent 1 day of delirium. P <0.05 was considered statistically signifi cant. Results Data were analyzed from 146 and 150 patients in the pre-ABCDE and post-ABCDE groups respectively. There were mean decreases of 0.59 MV days and 0.83 delirium days between the pre and post bundle implementation. The mean costs (per patient per ICU stay) of implementing the bundle components were signifi cantly higher in the post-ABCDE cohort versus the pre-ABCDE cohort ($191 vs. $92, P <0.0001), with an additional increase in total costs ($8,930 vs. $8,624, P = 0.0233). Costs to prevent 1 day of MV and to prevent 1 day of delirium were $552 and $368 respectively. In the non-MV patients, the post-ABCDE bundle demonstrated fewer days of delirium than the pre-ABCDE cohort (0.8 vs. 1.13 days, P <0.05) but had higher overall costs ($5,417 vs. $4,546, P <0.05), resulting in a cost of $2,639 to prevent 1 day of delirium in a non-MV patient. Conclusion Implementing the ABCDE bundle in adult ICU patients appears to be a feasible cost-eff ective strategy when considering costs of mechanical ventilation and ICU delirium.P410 An assessment of long-term sleep quality using actigraphy in survivors of critical illness K Solverson, C Doig University of Calgary, Canada Critical Care 2014, 18(Suppl 1):P410 (doi: 10.1186/cc13600) Introduction Recent studies have suggested that critical illness survivors experience long-term sleep disruption",

There was a wide range of dosing regimens: infusion schedules varied 10-fold and loading doses 15-fold. Clinical studies are required to establish the safety and effi cacy of clonidine in the ICU setting. References Introduction Both propofol and dexmedetomidine decrease systemic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output in a dose-dependent manner. The aim of this study was to compare their safety and effi cacy for intravenous sedation during mechanical ventilation. Methods Eighty-four patients with traumatic brain injury (Glasgow scale 7 to 8) entered the study, mean age 44 \u00b1 13.37 years. All patientsFigure 1 (abstract P414).

In the fi rst group (n = 42), sedation was performed by intravenous propofol infusion at a dose of 4 to 12 mg/kg/hour. In patients of the second group (n = 42), sedation was carried out by intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine at a dose of 0.2 to 1.4 mg/kg/hour. The level of sedation was assessed with bispectral index monitoring, targeting index 70. For comparison of methods we evaluated heart rate, blood pressure, SpO 2 30, 90 and 180 minutes after the start of sedation. Both groups were matched for sex, age and comorbidity. Results Thirty minutes after the start of sedation in patients of the fi rst group, HR was 83 \u00b1 11.31 beats/minute, blood pressure was 127 \u00b1 12.87/64 \u00b1 8.54 mmHg, SpO 2 was 97 \u00b1 3.01%. In patients of the second group 30 minutes after the beginning of sedation, HR was 87 \u00b1 10.01 beats/minute, blood pressure was 131 \u00b1 11.67/68 \u00b1 8.19 mmHg, SpO 2 was 97 \u00b1 2.98%. After 90 minutes in the fi rst group of patients, we observed HR was 81 \u00b1 6.27 beats/minute, blood pressure was 119 \u00b1 11.46/59 \u00b1 4.29 mmHg, SpO 2 was 98 \u00b1 2.35%. In the second group, HR was 82 \u00b1 7.31 beats/minute, blood pressure was 94 \u00b1 13.62/55 \u00b1 7.81 mmHg, SpO 2 was 97 \u00b1 2.76%. In the fi rst group 180 minutes after the start of sedation, HR was 86 \u00b1 6.19 beats/minute, blood pressure was 105 \u00b1 10.34/54 \u00b1 4.28 mmHg, SpO 2 was 98 \u00b1 1.32%. In the second group, HR was 75 \u00b1 6.27 beats/minute, blood pressure was 92 \u00b1 12.54/51 \u00b1 6.91 mmHg, SpO 2 was 96 \u00b1 2.91%. Conclusion Using dexmedetomidine at a dose of 0.2 to 1.4 mg/kg/hour for intravenous sedation is safe in terms of hemodynamic stability and blood oxygenation for sedation during mechanical lung ventilation in traumatic brain injury patients.P417 Diff erent eff ects of propofol and dexmedetomidine on preload dependency in endotoxemic shock with norepinephrine infusion: a randomized case-control study T Yu 1 , C Pan 1 , S Liu 1 , F Guo 1 , F Longhini 2 , Y Yang 1 , H Qiu 1 Zhong-Da Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; 2 Eastern Piedmont University ' A. Avogadro' , Novara, Italy Critical Care 2014, 18(Suppl 1):P417 (doi: 10.1186/cc13607) Introduction Septic shock is a status characterized by the simultaneous use of vasopressors and sedative drugs in critical care patients. Little is known about the possible interference of these drugs during shock status. We aimed to clarify how propofol could diff erently aff ect the preload dependency in an endotoxemic model in comparison with dexmedetomidine, by evaluation of the systemic vascular system and cardiac function. Methods After animal preparation and under PiCCO monitoring (BL), endotoxemic shock was induced by an intravenous bolus of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 055:B5) in ketamine-anesthetized rabbits. After fl uid resuscitation and norepinephrine infusion (SD0), animals were randomized to propofol (PROP, n = 8) or dexmedetomidine (DEX, n = 8) sedation, with two incremental doses (SD1 and SD2). The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central vein pressure (CVP) were monitored. Pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV) were assessed to evaluate the preload dependency. Global end-diastolic volume, vascular resistances, mean systemic fi lling pressure, cardiac functional index and vascular resistances were assessed at each time point. Normality was assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Twoway analysis of variance for repeated measures was applied, and the Student-Newmann-Keuls post-hoc test when indicated. P <0.05 was considered signifi cant.Results At the increasing dose of propofol, both PPV and SVV significantly increased in SD1 versus SD0 (P <0.01) and SD2 versus SD0 (P <0.001), but only PPV in SD2 versus SD1 (P = 0.024). Dexmedetomidine infusion did not aff ect PPV and SVV. At SD1 and SD2, PPV and SVV were higher in PROP with respect to DEX (P <0.001). Moreover, propofol infusion increased the heart rate and had no eff ects on cardiac contractility and vascular resistances. On the contrary, in the DEX group we recorded a signifi cant decrease in heart contractility and increment of vascular resistances at SD2. Nonetheless, both drugs aff ected the MAP, CVP, mean systemic fi lling pressure, global end-diastolic volume and venous return. Conclusion In an endotoxemic shock model, after fl uid resuscitation and during norepinephrine infusion, propofol increased more PPV and SVV in comparison with dexmedetomidine. At high dosage the vascular resistances and heart contractility were infl uenced by dexmedetomidine, but not by propofol.Introduction This re-audit aims to test our strategy for monitoring patients on propofol sedation for prolonged periods. Propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS), once established, is diffi cult to treat and currently there is limited guidance on how best to monitor for this potentially",

Maximum daily propofol dose ranged from 2.1 to 3.8 mg/kg/hour. Lipid profi le was checked in 16/25 (64%) patients (20% in 2011) whilst on propofol sedation. However, these were checked following 3 days continuous infusion in only three patients. The triglyceride level was \u22652.2 mmol/l (very high) on fi rst testing in 75% of patients. All patients had a 12-lead ECG done on admission. Seventeen of 25 (68%) had a further ECG performed whilst on continuous propofol infusion (45% in 2011). Additional ECGs were done in 13/17 patients (zero in 2011). ECG changes that we feel were attributable to propofol occurred in two patients, one of whom developed severe PRIS. Fourteen of 25 (56%) patients (55% in 2011) were on concomitant sedative agents. This included the patient who developed PRIS. Conclusion Awareness of complications from prolonged propofol sedation is increasing amongst our clinicians. This is refl ected in the increased frequency of lipid profi le and ECG monitoring compared with 2011. However, we feel that more regular and routine monitoring is essential to aid early detection of this potentially fatal complication. We recommend that all patients at risk of developing PRIS should have these parameters monitored on a daily basis as standard. Reference Introduction Sedation monitoring with the Bispectral Index (BIS) is uncommon during bronchoscopy but allows for a more objective measure of sedation; we hypothesized that higher BIS scores would correlate with lower patient satisfaction and that lower BIS scores (deep sedation) would result in better patient and physician satisfaction. Methods Between October 2012 and August 2013, bronchoscopy using conscious (CS) or monitored anesthetic deep sedation (DS) was monitored with BIS. Medication administration and procedures were time-stamped. Sedation was administered blinded to BIS score. DS cases used propofol infusions, CS cases used bolus midazolam and fentanyl.",

Of these, 127 paediatric patients were supported on mechanical ventilation on the fi rst day in the PICU and received intravenous analgesics and sedatives. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database. The statistical method was the Mann-Whitney U test, and P <0.05 was considered statistically signifi cant. Results Twenty-eight patients were scored with the WAT-1 during weaning from the drugs. Median age was 14 months (1 to 73 months) and the most common reasons for ventilation were airway trouble and pneumonia. Eight of 28 were diagnosed withdrawal syndrome, 20 were not. There were no signifi cant diff erences in age, body weight, cumulative morphine and benzodiazepine dose before weaning. In the withdrawal group, the lactate level, catecholamine index, Paediatric Index of Mortality 2 and heart rates were greater when they were admitted to hospital. Further, there are longer length of PICU stay and shorter ventilator-free days for patients with WAT-1 score >3. But all of them are alive at 28 days, so there is no diff erence in 28-day mortality. Conclusion Our study suggest that severely ill paediatric patients tended to suff er from withdrawal syndrome and then resulted in short ventilator-free days and longer PICU stay. But there is no diff erence in mortality. Reference1. Franck LS, et al.: Pain 2012, 153:142-148.

Methods An international web-based, online, viral, anonymous survey, a systematic review of the literature, and a meta-analysis of randomized and matched studies were performed. Results Nine epidural hematomas were identifi ed in 198 published manuscripts. The risk of epidural hematoma (9:13,429) calculated on all published evidence might be therefore estimated to be 1:1,492 (95% confi dence interval (CI) = 1:2,857 to 1:833).

Determination of eff ective implementation strategies regarding screening, treatment and prevention of delirium is critical to address needed modifi cations in the culture of patient care in the ICU. The aim of this study was to summarize the effi cacy of and the barriers to implementation of delirium management. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, Cochrane and CINAHL for studies published between January 2000 and October 2012, and included them when implementation strategies and their effi cacy and/or potential barriers of implementation were described. Results In all studies (n = 34) multifaceted education strategies were used and combined (median: 5; IQR: 4 to 6). Positive results were reported for both process and clinical outcomes: adherence to delirium screening -improvement after implementation compared with the before measurement, by 15 to 57%; only measured after implementation, between 84 and 92%; delirium knowledge (on a 10-point scale; improved from 6.1 and 6.2 before to 8.2 and 7.4 respectively (P <0.001) after implementation); length of stay in the ICU (4.1 vs. 5.9 days; P = 0.21 and 6.3 to 5.35 days; P < 0.009) and hospital stay (12 days vs. 18 days; P = 0.036 and from 55 to 27 days; P <0.0001); and decreased mortality (29.4% vs. 22.9%; P = 0.009; and OR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.92; P = 0.03). The major barriers found impairing implementation concerned clinicians' attitude and healthcare professionals' knowledge. Conclusion Implementation strategies used suggest a strong potential for multifaceted strategies to be able to aff ect both process and clinical outcomes. The majority of studies focused only on implementation of delirium screening. There is a knowledge defi cit regarding effi cacy of well-prepared implementation of integral delirium management considering screening, prevention, and treatment preceded by analysis of barriers.

Methods This is a single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial. During the 5-day study period, all patients received standard enteral nutrition product and were divided into three groups, including parenteral glutamine (Group I), enteral glutamine (Group II) and enteral + parenteral glutamine (Group III) supplementations. Blood biochemistry, rates of infections, length of stay in the ICU and duration of mechanical ventilation were evaluated. Results Sixty patients were included in this study. There was no statistically signifi cant diff erence for biochemical values between the diff erent feeding groups. Frequency of infections ranged as Group II >Group III >Group I and mortality as Group II = Group III >Group I. Length of stay in the ICU and duration of mechanical ventilation were signifi cantly longer in Group II than the others. Conclusion Although mortality was not signifi cantly diff erent between groups, parenteral glutamine administration causes less stay of ICU and mechanical ventilation. This needs a more powerful randomized controlled study[1]. Reference1. Est\u00edvariz CF, et al.: J Parenter Enteral Nutr 2008, 32:389-402.Introduction Gastric residual volumes (GRVs) as measured at regular intervals are considered a marker of tolerance of enteral nutrition (EN). There is controversy surrounding this practice, however. The absolute value for the designated cutoff value for GRVs varies widely in the literature. No prospective randomized control trials have suggested that their use improves patient outcomes in the ICU. It has also not been shown, therefore, that GRVs are an accurate predictor of aspiration or pneumonia. However, the use of GRVs as a guide to the continuation of EN can result in a reduction in the percentage of goal calories received by patients. Prior to February 2013, in our ICU the threshold of GRVs prior to withholding of EN was 200 ml. This tolerated volume was increased to 500 ml in February 2013, in compliance with recent guidelines. By increasing the acceptable GRVs to this level, the aim was to increase the percentage of goal calories received by patients via the enteral route. Methods Following ethical approval, the practice of measuring GRVs and the subsequent management of EN was retrospectively reviewed over a 3-month period, September to December 2012, and prospectively reviewed over a 3-month period, September to December 2013, following the change in practice. Recorded parameters included: length of ICU admission; admitting diagnosis; duration of EN; GRVs; prescribed calories; delivered calories via an enteral route; requirement for PN; duration of PN; and cost of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Results The change of practice in terms of GRVs and management of EN led to an increased percentage of prescribed calories that was delivered. There was a reduced requirement for PN and reduced cost of TPN also associated with this change in practice. Conclusion Increasing the threshold of GRV prior to reducing or stopping EN can result in increased calories delivered to ICU patients and a reduced requirement for and cost of TPN.P426 Early enteral feeding in the septic critically ill patient: evaluation of our feeding protocol M Theodorakopoulou, I Dimopoulou, S Karambi, A Strilakou, A Diamantakis, S Orfanos, A Armaganidis University Hospital of Athens Greece ' Attikon' , Attiki, Greece Critical Care 2014, 18(Suppl 1):P426 (doi: 10.1186/cc13616)",

The aims were to assess the preoperative nutritional status, to compare postoperative energy needs with eff ectively delivered amounts, and to evaluate the impact of a dietitian on optimizing postoperative energy balances. Methods A prospective interventional study in adult patients after elective CABG and/or heart valve surgery. The patients' nutritional risk was determined by the NRS 2002 and the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST)[2]. A dedicated dietitian managed and assisted the nutritional approach. For each patient, global energy intake (intentional and non-intentional) and balance (diff erence between energy target and global caloric intake) were calculated daily during and after ICU stay until hospital discharge. The Harris-Benedict equation was used to calculate daily energy requirements. When energy delivery did not reach 60% of calculated needs, a protocoldriven nutritional intervention was initiated. Results Two hundred patients were enrolled during a 10-month period, representing 2,690 study-days. Mean age was 67 \u00b1 11 years. In total, 42.5% of the patients had a NRS 2002 score >3 and were considered to be nutritionally at risk. MUST identifi ed a high, medium, or low risk in respectively 1%, 4% and 95% of subjects. Mean energy requirement was 2,046 \u00b1 347 kcal and mean daily intake 1,452 \u00b1 335 kcal. Sixty-two percent of the caloric need was met during the entire hospital stay. Nutritional intervention was necessary in 52% of cases: oral feeding supplementation for 546 study-days, enteral feeding: 401 days, parenteral feeding: 367 days. This reduced the mean cumulative caloric defi cit to 9,085 kcal. Conclusion Close monitoring of caloric intake shouldered by interventions based on a predefi ned algorithm under supervision of a dedicated nutrition team restricts the caloric defi cit in cardiac surgery patients.IntroductionVitamins are essential micronutrients and depletions are reported for chronically ill patients. It is well known that the general nutrition status of the homeless is poor, especially for heavy alcoholics. But there were few data about the actual vitamin status of homeless patients. We want to evaluate the vitamin levels of homeless patients. Methods This study was conducted at a single urban teaching hospital emergency department. We performed a retrospective chart review of blood vitamin B1, B12, B6 and C levels of homeless patients. These vitamins are a common supplement in our center and sometimes blood levels are drawn if the patient is drunk, needs i.v. hydration and has cachexic features. Results During study periods, vitamin levels were checked for 156 patients. The number of male patients was 146 (94%) and the mean age was 50 \u00b1 10.2. Vitamin C levels were 15.8 \u00b1 1.3 mg/l.

Diagnosis of AKI may be improved by examination of the urinary sediment with microscopy and by measurement of urine albumin. A urine microscopy score (UMS; 0 to 4 points) of renal tubular epithelial cells and granular casts has previously been developed to aid diagnosis. We have devised a urine albumin:creatinine ratio score (ACRS; 0 to 4 points) and have combined this with the UMS with the aim of stratifying the risk of developing future AKI or worsening AKI (UMS-ACRS; 0 to 8 points). The aims were to compare UMS-ACRS in critically ill patients with and without AKI at ICU admission, and to determine whether a high UMS-ACRS can predict if critically ill patients develop AKI or worsening AKI. Methods Investigators were blinded to diagnosis prior to urine collection. Microscopy was performed on centrifuged urine obtained from 227 consecutive critically ill patients in a general ICU on day 1 of admission. Five photographs were taken and the mean UMS was calculated. An independent reviewer scored the photographs. The urine albumin:creatinine ratio was calculated and the ACRS determined. The UMS was then combined with the ACRS. Results Mean UMS-ACRS \u00b1 SD was higher (2.66 \u00b1 1.57) in patients with AKI on ICU admission (n = 106) compared with those without AKI (mean UMS-ACRS = 2.40 \u00b1 1.03; n = 120), unpaired t test P = 0.14. Patients who developed AKI or worsening AKI (n = 58) had a mean score of 2.79 \u00b1 1.21 versus 2.30 \u00b1 1.14 in those who never developed AKI or improved (n = 150), P = 0.006. UMS-ACRS score >2 on admission had a sensitivity of 0.89 for identifying progressive AKI. UMS-ACRS score of 5 to 8 on admission had a positive predictive value for worsening AKI of 60%, a negative predictive value of 69% and a likelihood ratio 3.1 for developing AKI or worsening AKI. Conclusion The mean UMS-ACRS is higher in patients with AKI. Combining UMS with ACRS improves prediction and stratifi cation of which patients will develop AKI, or progressive AKI, after ICU admission. Clinical implications are that urine microscopy and ACR calculation are safe, inexpensive, non-invasive and may improve prediction of AKI in critically ill patients, potentially leading to earlier intervention and improved outcomes. Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly common in critically ill patients and many patients with severe kidney injury require continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). However, little is known regarding the incidence rate and associated factors for developing chronic kidney disease after CRRT in AKI patients. This study aimed to investigate renal outcome and the factors associated with incomplete renal recovery in AKI patients who received CRRT. Methods Between January 2011 and August 2013, 397 patients received CRRT in our ICU. Among them, patients who had normal renal function before AKI and were discharged without maintenance renal replacement therapy (RRT) were included in this study. We examined the incidence of incomplete renal recovery with estimated glomerular fi ltration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/minute/1.73 m 2 during follow-up. Factors that increased risk of incomplete renal recovery after AKI were investigated with multiple logistic regression. Results Forty-one AKI patients were discharged without further RRT and followed up for a mean of 7 months. Sixteen (39.0%) of 41 patients incompletely recovered their renal function. Patients with incomplete renal recovery showed older age and longer duration of anuria compared with complete renal recovery patients (69.7 \u00b1 7.0 vs. 54.8 \u00b1 16.9 years, P = 0.002; 128.6 \u00b1 192.1 vs. 26.9 \u00b1 66.6 hours, P = 0.019). Multivariate analysis adjusting for sex, initial eGFR, hemoglobin level, diabetes mellitus and hypertension showed that old age and long duration of anuria were independent risk factors for incomplete renal recovery (OR = 1.143, 95% CI = 1.020 to 1.281, P = 0.021 and OR = 1.011, 95% CI = 1.001 to 1.032, P = 0.038, respectively). Conclusion The renal outcome of severe AKI requiring CRRT was poor even in patients with previous normal renal function. Long-term monitoring of renal function is needed especially in severe AKI patients with old age and long duration of anuria. Introduction A high postoperative serum myoglobin (MyG) concentration predicts the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), as reported in several surgical settings. The incidence of such events in the ICU is reported to be 2 to 5% of all causes of AKI [1] , but can even worsen in the case of cardiac surgery (40.3%) [1] . MyG is a small protein (17.8 kDa) that can be removed with RRT, typically in convection cases. New-generation membranes, removing sub-albumin protein molecular weight solutes, can be used in diff usive treatments (CVVHD) with the advantage of limiting albumin loss and easily combining with citrate anticoagulation, pivotal for cardio-surgical settings. We assessed the eff ectiveness of EMIC2 with citrate anticoagulation in AKI prevention of post-cardiac surgical patients. Methods This is a case series of eight patients (mean age 62.7 years, fi ve male, EuroSCORE log 15.61) in cardiac surgery on CPBP for 150 minutes Introduction Sleep deprivation is recognised as an important cause of morbidity after ICU admission, but most centres do not routinely assess their patients' sleep. Considering the invasive nature and costs associated with objective sleep measurements, they are unsuitable for routine use. Subjective measurements off er an easy-to-use and economical alternative, the most well validated of which is the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ). This can be used to derive an accurate estimation of the sleep effi ciency index (SEI), a well-validated measure of sleep. However, there are several concerns regarding patients reporting their sleep quality and quantity using these questionnaires [1] . Additionally, they cannot be used to assess sleep in sedated or delirious patients. It has been suggested that one way to bypass the drawbacks of patients assessing their own sleep would be to utilise nursing staff [1] . Previous smaller scare studies have since agreed with this suggestion [2] . This study aimed to assess whether staff were able to use the RCSQ to accurately assess their patients' sleep.Methods Fifty-nine patients consented to complete the RCSQ for each night of their ICU admission. Alongside this, the nurses who had cared for these patients were asked to assess their patients' sleep using the RCSQ. These were then matched with their patients' responses. The Bland-Altman method was applied to assess for agreement between patient and nurse SEIs in order to reveal whether nurses could accurately estimate their patients' night sleep. Additionally, Cronbach's alpha was derived to assess for internal consistency. Ethical approval was gained prior to the start of the study. Results A total of 126 pairs or RCSQs were gathered. The mean diff erence between nurse and patient SEIs was -0.9, suggesting there is no signifi cant trend regarding nurses overestimating or underestimating patients' SEIs. In total, 94.2% of nurses' estimations fell within the limits of agreement. The variability of the diff erences was consistent across the range of averages. Cronbach's alpha was 0.63 between nurse and patient scores, suggesting questionable reliability between the RCSQ pairs. See Figure 1 . . However, we found no correlation between the PSI and the % delta power, both at baseline (R = 0.32, P = 0.37) and after pain stimulation (R = 0.17, P = 0.63). The % delta power from frontal electrodes (Fp2-Fp1) was well correlated with that obtained from posterior electrodes (P4-Pz; R = 0.42, P < 0.0001), and remained unchanged after pain stimulation, indeed confi rming a deep sedation level in our patient cohort. Conclusion Using standard EEG in this small cohort of mechanically ventilated ICU patients, a deep sedation level was frequently observed. Our preliminary data suggest that simplifi ed EEG with the SedLine system is less accurate than the standard 19-channel EEG to assess the depth of sedation in the ICU setting. Introduction Pain is a common problem in mechanically ventilated patients and assessing pain in the sedated patient is diffi cult, as patients are often unable to verbalise [1] . Behavioural pain assessment tools have been developed and validated for the assessment of pain in this patient group. A behavioural pain assessment tool was implemented as part of a wider ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention programme within a large UK ICU. Methods The Behavioural Pain Scale (BPS) [2] was selected and implemented into daily clinical practice supported by a tailored education programme and incorporation into the clinical information system (MetaVision). Questionnaires pre and post BPS implementation were used to assess nursing staff opinions on pain assessment and opioid infusion titration. Four months of data were compared pre and post implementation, examining aspects of patient sedation and analgesia exposure and ventilated patient outcome parameters.",

Compliance was good, with a median daily documentation rate of 66% with the standard being once per 8-hour shift. Median BPS score rank was signifi cantly higher on patient movement (2 (1; 2)) compared with at rest (1 (1; 2); P <0.001) (1 = no pain, 2 = mild pain). No statistically signifi cant diff erence was seen in the length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, VAP rate or median sedation exposure. Pre-implementation median opioid administration when looking at morphine (mg) equivalence was 455.8 (203.1; 1,174.8), and post implementation the median increased to 620.3 (218.1; 1,502); however, this did not reach statistical signifi cance (P = 0.235). There was no statistically signifi cant change in the prescribing of analgesic adjuncts. The sample size was underpowered to detect signifi cant diff erences. Conclusion The BPS was successfully implemented into routine nursing practice and signifi cantly improved nurse confi dence in opioid infusion titration. Analgesic use was not signifi cantly diff erent between evaluation periods, but the results indicate that further education on anticipating pain and treating pain pre-emptively with timely administration of opioids is needed.

Besides its cardiovascular eff ects, ranolazine improves diff erent neuronal functions, and thus its use has been proposed for the treatment of pain and epileptic disorders [3, 4] . Since astrocytes are involved in neuronal infl ammatory processes, and autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases [5] , we have investigated the antiinfl ammatory and antioxidant eff ects of ranolazine in primary cultured astrocytes.Methods We incubated diff erentiated rat astrocytes in primary culture (10 days of culture) [5] for 24 hours with ranolazine (10 -5 , 10 -6 , 10 -7 M). We measured the protein expression levels of PPAR\u03b3 and Cu/Zn-SOD by western blot technique. Protective eff ect of ranolazine on cell viability was assayed using MTT conversion assay. Finally, to evaluate the eff ect of ranolazine on the IL-1\u03b2 cytokine and TNF\u03b1 mediators, we used the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique.Results Compared with control cells, treatment with ranolazine induced an increment of anti-infl ammatory PPAR\u03b3 and reduced the proinfl ammatory mediators IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 in primary cultured astrocytes. Ranolazine (10 -6 M) also increased the expression of antioxidant protein Cu/Zn-SOD and caused a signifi cant increase in cell viability.Conclusion Ranolazine decreases infl ammatory mediators IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1, and increases anti-infl ammatory PPAR\u03b3 as well as the antioxidant Cu/Zn-SOD in astrocytes in culture. These results suggest that ranolazine could be useful as a neuroprotective drug in pathologies inducing infl ammatory damage and oxidant processes. References",

T Tamosuitis Introduction Multimodal neuromonitoring is a part of goaldirected therapy in severe neurosurgical pathology that leads to better understanding and therefore accurate and timely correction of disturbances of cerebral perfusion. The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare microcirculation in the conjunctiva of the eye and sublingual mucosa in brain-dead patients and healthy volunteers.No studies to our knowledge with this purpose were performed previously. We hypothesized that direct videomicroscopic evaluation of conjunctival microcirculation is linked to cerebral blood fl ow.Methods We evaluated microcirculation of the eye conjunctiva and sublingual mucosa of 10 brain-dead diagnosed patients and 10 healthy volunteers. Brain-death diagnoses were certifi ed by cerebral angiography. Direct in vivo observation of the microcirculation was obtained with sidestream dark-fi eld imaging. Assessment of microcirculatory parameters of convective oxygen transport (microvascular fl ow index (MFI), proportion of perfused vessels (PPV)), and diff usion distance (perfused vessel density (PVD) and total vessel density (TVD)) was performed according to international criteria. Results All brain-dead patients required vasopressor support to sustain perfusion of donor organs. The MFI of small vessels was signifi cantly lower in brain-dead patients in comparison with healthy controls in ocular conjunctiva (2.6 (2.4 to 2.8) vs. 3.0 (3.0 to 3.0), P = 0.03) and in sublingual mucosa (2.8 (2.6 to 2.9) vs. 3.0 (3.0 to 3.0), P = 0.04). TVD and PVD of small vessels were signifi cantly lower in brain-dead patients in comparison with healthy controls in ocular conjunctiva (10. Introduction Stroke is the main cause of deterioration of activity of daily living in Japan. The social problem in Japan is the diff erence in medical quality between the urban and depopulated areas. To improve the problem, telemedicine using a mobile device between general physicians and stroke specialists became important with the increasing demand for rapid and correct diagnosis for treatment of acute stroke. We developed a system for rapidly exchanging diagnostic images and clinical information in depopulated areas to develop the standard thrombolytic therapy using alteplase for acute ischemic stroke [1, 2] .Methods A system was consisted of communicating patient data and imaging between the hospital system and participating staff members in and out of the hospital using mobile devices. The system can transfer clinical data and large volumes of CT and MRI, and expert opinion in real time. We developed the system (k-support) in the Kaifu area, which is a typical depopulated area in Tokushima Prefecture, Japan, between the general physicians in Tokushima Prefectural Kaifu Hospital and specialists in stroke and cardiovascular disease at Tokushima University Hospital from February 2013.Results The k-support system was managed in 102 emergency patients, 65 patients (64%) were classifi ed as neurological disease, 41 (40%) as stroke, 11 (11%) as head injury, two (2%) as epilepsy. The detail of stroke was ischemia in 35 (34%), hemorrhage in four (4%) and SAH in two (2%). Two ischemic stroke patients were treated with intravenous thrombolysis of alteplase using the k-support system and a 'dripand-ship' paradigm. One patient using alteplase showed complete recanalization of the middle cerebral artery. The consultations resulted in hospitalization in 42%, transfer in 37% and return home in 20%.Conclusion Before introduction of the k-support system, the standard thrombolytic therapy using alteplase for acute ischemic stroke could not operate in the Kaifu area due to the absence of stroke specialists and the long distance to a neighboring stroke center. The telemedicine system using a mobile device as the k-support system can be used anytime, anywhere and by anyone. This system can communicate with the doctors, between general physicians in depopulated areas and specialists in urban areas, and may become a useful tool for acute patient management in not only stroke but also other emergency diseases. References Methods Twenty rats were assigned to one of three groups: a double 250 \u03bcl intracisternal injection (ICI) was realized with saline in the CONTROLS group (n = 6) or with autologous arterial blood in the SAH (n = 8) and SAH+TER (n = 6) groups. Treated animals received an oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day TER during 5 days following blood injection. Rats were evaluated using a functional isotope imaging technique (high-resolution microSPECT). Brain capture of three 99m technetium radiolabeled tracers was evaluated: HMPAO at day (D) 0, 2 and 5 for cerebral perfusion quantifi cation, DTPA at D3 for blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity study and annexin V-128 at D4 for apoptotic activity study. Radioactivity was measured in a predefi ned region of interest: cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem. Statistical analysis: oneway ANOVA followed by Student's t test. Results Brain HMPAO perfusion microSPECT ( Figure 1) Introduction After a patient is declared brain dead, the cessation or withdrawal of therapy in Japan is quite a diffi cult operation because of the legal issues involved. Therapy is continued except in the case of donation of organs for transplantation from brain-dead patients until their cardiac arrest. Consequently, we may determine what the fi nal cause of death is in brain-dead patients. Our hypothesis is that braindead patients ultimately die of cardiac failure. Methods From January 2011 to December 2012, brain-dead adult patients in our ICU were investigated. The declaration of brain death is determined by clinical neurological examinations, electroencephalography, and the auditory brain-stem response test. Age, sex, primary diagnosis, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission, the number of days from the diagnosis of brain death until cardiac arrest (days), the fi nal cause of cardiac arrest, urine volume for the last 24 hours (ml), serum potassium levels (mEq/l), PaO 2 (mmHg) and ",

Methods Forty-six patients with TBI requiring intubation between January 2000 and December 2012 were included. Patients were grouped into BAL-positive (>0.5\u2030; n = 24) and BAL-negative (<0.5\u2030; n = 22). Physiological parameters and outcome (survival to hospital discharge (STHD)) and neurological outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)) were analyzed. Diff erences between groups were analyzed using Student's t test and results presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Results There were no signifi cant diff erences in gender and age distributions between the BAL-negative and BAL-positive groups (73% vs. 88% male; P = 0.218; 53 \u00b1 21 vs. 43 \u00b1 17 years; P = 0.098). There were also no diff erences in initial systolic blood pressure (BP; 144 \u00b1 30 vs. 132 \u00b1 37 mmHg; P = 0.241) and respiratory rate (RR; 13 \u00b1 6 vs. 12 \u00b1 7/ minute; P = 0.891) but BAL did aff ect the initial GCS score (7 \u00b1 3 vs. 5 \u00b1 2; P = 0.022). There was no eff ect on CPC (3.5 \u00b1 1.9 vs. 2.8 \u00b1 1.8; P = 0.185), GOS (2.4 \u00b1 1.8 vs. 3.0 \u00b1 1.7; P = 0.270), and GCS at discharge from the hospital (14 \u00b1 2 vs. 14 \u00b1 2; P = 0.801). There were also no diff erences in length of hospital stay (LOHS; 15 \u00b1 23 vs. 23 \u00b1 34; P = 0.372) and STHD (1.6 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 1.3 \u00b1 0.5; P = 0.083).Conclusion BAL did not have a signifi cant eff ect on presenting physiological parameters such as systolic BP and RR. It did, however, aff ect the presenting GCS score, which was signifi cantly lower in the BAL-positive group. BAL did not seem to have an eff ect on functional outcome or mortality measured by STHD. No favorable neuroprotective or deleterious eff ect was observed, demonstrated by no signifi cant diff erences in CPC, GOS or GCS scores at discharge. Psychiatrists or neurointensivists evaluated delirium using the DSM-IV criteria for delirium. Assessments results were blinded and performed independently. Criterion validity of the CAM-ICU and the ICDSC were calculated from 2 \u00d7 2 frequency tables using standard defi nitions of sensitivity, specifi city, positive and negative predictive value, and overall accuracy. Because delirium was assessed repeatedly, estimates of 95% CIs for binary repeated data using generalized estimating equation in conjunction with the Huber-White estimator were performed. Inter-rater reliability for the CAM-ICU and ICDSC was assessed with the kappa coeffi cient.",

The overall sensitivity and specifi city for CAM-ICU (62% and 74%, respectively) and ICDSC (64% and 79%, respectively) were similar.

In subgroup analyses, the CAM-ICU and ICDSC showed increased sensitivity and decreased specifi city in moderate TBI as well as deeper levels of sedation (RASS -2 to -3).Conclusion Criterion validity and inter-rater reliability of the CAM-ICU and ICDSC were good. Severity of TBI and depth of sedation infl uence delirium assessments. Clinicians should be aware of those limitations before using these clinical tools in this population. Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and long-term disability worldwide, and understanding its eff ect on health is critical. Although mortality has been a gold standard for years, functional scales and quality of life have been used as main outcome measures over the last decades due to their usefulness and aid in decision-making for medical teams, patients, and families. Despite this preference, no consensus exists for the most optimal outcome measure. We systematically reviewed outcome measures used in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with severe TBI admitted to an acute care hospital. Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, BIOSIS and references of eligible trials. RCTs published over the last 7 years (2006 to October 2013) in 18 selected journals (based on impact factor) were considered for inclusion. RCTs performed in adults with severe TBI (GCS \u22648) were eligible. The primary endpoint was the outcome measures used in RCTs. The secondary outcomes were the timing of assessment and the methodological quality of trials using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Two independent reviewers selected trials and collected data using a standardized form. Results From 5,602 citations retrieved after removal of duplicates, 36 RCTs met eligibility criteria. The outcome measures most frequently used were neurophysiologic indices (n = 18, 50%), the Glasgow Outcome Scale (n = 17, 47%), mainly at 6 months, nonspecifi c complications (n = 15, 42%), mortality (n = 12, 33%), and biomarkers (n = 10, 28%). Nine trials reported only physiologic indices and did not present any clinical or functional outcome measures. The methodological quality of included RCTs was heterogeneous. We observed a low risk of bias for sequence generation (n = 29, 80%), allocation concealment (n = 20, 55%), complete data reporting (n = 30, 83%), selective reporting (n = 36, 100%), and sample size (n = 21, 58%) but a high risk of bias for blinding (n = 20, 55%). Conclusion A simple prognostic model, based only on age and GCS, displayed a fairly good prognostic performance in predicting 6-month mortality of ICU-treated patients with moderate-to-severe TBI. The use of more complex scoring systems added little to the prognostic performance.",

            "text": "Results Of 65 patients with TBI, 25 patients (18 men, seven women; mean age 56.7 \u00b1 20.1) who were administered antiepileptic agents for PTS prophylaxis were studied. Fifteen cerebral contusions, 10 acute subdural hematomas, nine traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhages, two cerebral infarctions, two pneumocephalus and one traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage were shown in 25 patients. All patients were alive 28 days after the injury. Fourteen patients (56%) were intravenously administered (13 phenytoin and one phenobarbital), while 11 patients (44%) were administered with enteral feeding (four valproates, four carbamazepine and three zonisamides) as PTS prophylaxis. The average start day of PTS prophylaxis was 2.6 days after the injury by intravenous administration, and 2.2 days by enteral administration, respectively. Two patients with phenytoin showed hepatic dysfunction as an adverse eff ect and no patient showed early PTS both by intravenous and by enteral administrations. Conclusion The present study has some limitations because it is a single-center retrospective analysis. However, enteral administration of antiepileptic agents could be useful for PTS prophylaxis. Considering cost, adverse eff ects and serum monitoring, there is a possibility of enteral administration of antiepileptic agents as an alternative to intravenous phenytoin. Introduction We aimed to summarize the effi cacy of simulation-based education in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and airway management [1] . Methods We searched the MEDLINE, Scopus and EMBASE databases for all peer-reviewed articles enrolling physicians/medical students in a simulation of either cardiopulmonary resuscitation or airway management protocols compared with no intervention or traditional teaching methods. We categorized the outcomes of the studies into four groups: task success, process skill, time skill, knowledge. Task success was defi ned as evaluation of successful completion of the task, process skill as evaluation of the procedure, time skill as the time required to complete the task, and knowledge as the objective assessment of conceptual understanding. When studies investigated more than one outcome, we considered the primary outcome, the overall measure or the most clinically relevant outcome. Results From 8,528 articles, we selected 24 studies (13 randomized controlled studies, eight pre-post studies, three case-control studies) involving 1,149 participants. Compared with no intervention or traditional teaching methods, simulation was associated with a signifi cant improvement from mild to moderate of all outcomes (Figure 1 ). Log of odds ratio for task success was 2.03 (0.46 to 3.59) in favor of simulation. Pooled eff ect size for process skill was 0.48 (0.11 to 0.84), for time skill was 0.29 (0.13 to 0.73) and for knowledge was 0.41 (0 to 0.84). Conclusion Simulation is an eff ective educational method to improve performance of physicians/medical students in the application of protocols for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and airway management. Results Thirty-two resuscitation episodes during transportation by ambulance were analyzed. Median CPR time per episode was 846 seconds (range 126 to 1,833 seconds). In total, the fraction of time without chest compression was 19.5 \u00b1 7.6% (mean \u00b1 SD). Reasons for interruption and its fraction of time in total hands-off time were as follows: 36% accounted for rhythm analysis/pulse check, 31% for ventilation, 11% for setting up automated chest compression devices, 8% for tracheal intubation/placement of supraglottic airway devices, 4% for intravenous line placement/administration of adrenaline, 3% for rescuer change, and 7% for adjustment of patient position/correction of rescuer posture and others. Conclusion The fraction of time without chest compression observed in this study was comparative with those found in other studies in spite of the diffi cult situations, such as during transportation. Most frequent reasons for hands-off time were rhythm analysis and ventilation even though the ambulance crews strictly adhered to the guidelines. Introduction During advanced life support (ALS) it is still impossible to predict return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or outcome. Cerebral saturation (rSO 2 ) measurements with near-infrared spectroscopy can be used in cardiac arrest circumstances and could play a role in predicting ROSC or neurologic outcome [1] . It is known that an initial rhythm of asystole and a long no/low-fl ow time has a worse outcome. We measured rSO 2 during ALS in out-of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients and compared the mean rSO 2 during the fi rst minute with the time between the emergency call (EC) and start of ALS. Methods With IRB approval, rSO 2 was prospectively measured between December 2011 and November 2013 in 51 OHCA cases with presumed cardiac cause during ALS. One sensor of the EQUANOX Advance was applied to the right side of the patient's forehead when the medical emergency team arrived. The measurement was continued until death of the patient or arrival at the ICU. Survivors (S) are defi ned as sustained ROSC longer than 20 minutes. CPR data were collected using the Utstein CPR data registration. The Mann-Whitney test and Pearson chisquare were utilized for comparison of S and nonsurvivors (NS) data. The Pearson test was used to examine correlation.",

A signifi cant diff erence in time of EC and start of ALS was observed between S (12 minutes; 8 to 15) and NS (14 minutes; 12 to 17) (P = 0.03). Mean initial rSO 2 was 34% (\u00b1 23) and 24% (\u00b1 12.5) in S and NS (P = 0.077). We observed a negative correlation between mean initial rSO 2 and time between EC and ALS (correlation coeffi cient -0.243; P = 0.041). Conclusion A tendency towards higher mean initial rSO 2 in S compared with NS was observed together with a negative correlation between mean initial rSO 2 and time between the EC and start of ALS. Also a signifi cant diff erence in time between the EC and start of ALS between S and NS is observed. Larger studies are needed to confi rm the possible function of rSO 2 as a surrogate for time between the EC and start of ALS. Reference Introduction Induced hypothermia is applied in the ICU and in the operating theater to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury. It is thought that induced hypothermia may hamper the immune response and therefore carry the risk of acquiring or aggravating an infection. We investigated the eff ect of hypothermia on host response by comparing survivors of cardiac arrest in which body temperature was kept at either 33\u00b0C or 36\u00b0C. Methods As a substudy to the Target Temperature Management trial [1] in which cardiac arrest patients admitted to the ICU were randomized to maintaining either 33\u00b0C (n = 11) or 36\u00b0C (n = 9) for 24 hours, blood was drawn at the start and end of the target temperature phase as well as after reaching normotemperature. Host response was measured via monocyte human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression and via whole blood stimulation with TLR ligands lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteicoic acid (LTA) for 24 hours. Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), macrophage infl ammatory proteins (MIP)-1, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and soluble CD40 ligand levels were determined with ELISA or Luminex. Statistics were by unpaired Mann-Whitney U tests. Results HLA-DR expression was decreased compared with healthy controls, without diff erences between 33\u00b0C and 36\u00b0C. Following whole blood stimulation with LPS, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 production was lower after cardiac arrest compared with healthy controls. The 33\u00b0C and 36\u00b0C groups diff ered at baseline in TNF\u03b1 levels after LPS whole blood stimulation. After 24 hours of temperature management, there was no diff erence in both TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 production between the groups following TLR ligand stimulation. Introduction Shivering complicates targeted temperature management (TTM) by increasing metabolism, oxygen consumption, rest ing energy expenditure, and carbon dioxide production and is associated with lower brain tissue oxygen levels; all of these may limit the eff ectiveness of TTM. However, the recognition and measurement of shivering are subjective and ill-defi ned. The Bedside Shivering Assessment Scale (BSAS) is the only validated tool to describe the intensity of shivering. We hypothesized that the derived electromyography (dEMG) value measured by the bispectral index monitor (BIS) would agree with energy expenditure due to shivering, compared with the BSAS. Methods We measured continuous indirect calorimetry during a 2 to 5 hour time span during targeted temperature management in 12 patients being treated for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest. Patients were excluded if seizing, requiring >FiO 2 0.5, exhibiting early spasticity, or not shivering. The BSAS was measured every 15 minutes by a blinded observer and shivering was treated for a BSAS \u22651, as per institutional protocol. The association of dEMG and BSAS as a predictor of resting energy exposure (REE) was measured using linear regression and Pearson's correlation.",

There were a total of 182 measurements of BSAS, dEMG, and REE. There is improved correlation between REE and dEMG compared with REE and BSAS (0.24 (CI = 0.10 to 0.37) vs. 0.10 (CI = -0.04 to 0.24); P <0.001 vs. 0.14). Each increase in dEMG resulted in an increase of 14 kcal of energy expenditure (P = 0.003). Conclusion Continuous dEMG power measured by Covidien BIS monitors is a more accurate and less subjective measure of shivering burden compared with the intermittent BSAS. Introducing dEMG into clinical practice may improve recognition of shivering, allow quantifi cation of the metabolic cost of shivering, and serve as a more reliable research tool for diagnostic and treatment strategies of shivering. Introduction Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) improves neurological outcomes in such patients. During TH, neuromuscular blockade is used to control shivering in the patient. In our hospital, we use vecuronium as a neuromuscular blocker. However, occasionally, prolonged eff ects of vecuronium delay accurate evaluation of patients' neurological function or extubation. Unfortunately, the factors involved in the prolonged eff ect of vecuronium in TH remain unclear.",

In this study, the time from the end of vecuronium administration to full-muscle reaction to TOF was evaluated as the outcome. We calculated the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the outcome using Cox regression analysis after adjustment for age, gender, albumin levels, estimated glomerular fi ltration rate, temperature at the end of vecuronium administration, and total amount of vecuronium per kilogram of body weight. . We supposed that there might be a large consumption of high-energy phosphates during the rewarming period, and this might be associated with awakening and SND. Due to diffi culty in measuring such high-energy phosphates at the bedside, we measured the serum phosphate concentration (P) as a substitute, and assessed its infl uence on awakening and postoperative SND. Methods Twenty patients with a mean age of 68 \u00b1 11 years who underwent open TAR under DHCA applied at a temperature of 20\u00b0C, with antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) or retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP), were enrolled.
