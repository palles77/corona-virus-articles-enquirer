It has been reported that up to 55% and 33% of these cases remain without a known cause, respectively, in canine and feline pregnancies. Unusual abortigenic and potentially zoonotic agents, including Coxiella burnetii and Leptospira spp., may be involved in these cases. C. burnetii is able to cause reproductive disorders in cattle, sheep and goats, and cases of abortion have been observed in dogs and cats. Moreover, several outbreaks of C. burnetii infection in humans have been caused by delivering bitches and queens, and some of these animals experienced abortion. Leptospira interrogans sensu lato is able to cause abortion or stillbirth in several animal species and its abortigenic role has occasionally been described in bitches and queens. The aim of this study was to search for C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. DNA in a retrospective series of 103 cases of canine and feline abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality submitted for the identification of possible infectious agents. One hundred and fifty-one specimens were tested using PCR assays and found negative for C. burnetii and Leptospira DNA. However, in 49 samples (47.6%) other infectious causes of abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality were identified. These results showed that C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. are probably not common abortigenic agents or causes of neonatal deaths in dogs. However, given the potential abortigentic and zoonotic role of these agents, surveillance of canine and feline abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality could be advisable for a systematic investigation of these events.",

The etiology of these losses is complex and can be classically divided into infectious and noninfectious causes. Among the infectious causes, bacterial diseases are reported as a primary cause of mortality in puppies and kittens during the first week of age. 1 Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Brucella canis, Campylobacter spp., and Salmonella spp., are described as the most frequently isolated pathogens causing pregnancy losses in bitches and queens and canine and feline neonatal mortality. 2\u00c04 Canine distemper virus, canine herpesvirus (CHV-1), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine minute virus, feline herpesvirus (FHV-1), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), and feline infectious peritonitis, caused by a coronavirus, are reported as the most common viral causes of canine and feline pregnancy loss and neonatal mortality. Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum also are considered as rare causes of abortion and neonatal mortality. 1, 5 Nevertheless, a percentage of these cases of abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality remain without an aetiological identification. For example, it has been reported that 33% of feline neonatal mortality 2 and 55% of canine neonatal deaths 3 were attributed to unknown etiology. In these cases, the involvement of unusual infectious pathogens not routinely investigated in canine and feline abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality cannot be excluded.",

            "text": "Worldwide, C burnetii and Leptospira interrogans sensu lato are bacterial agents well known for their potential abortigenic role in many animal species. C. burnetii is the causative agent of an important and underdiagnosed zoonosis with worldwide distribution, Q fever. Livestock species have traditionally been considered as reservoirs of infection, with microorganisms found in high concentrations in the placenta and reproductive tracts of cattle, sheep, and goats. However, the potential role of other animal reservoirs, including cats and dogs, has been supposed. 6 Antibodies against C. burnetii have been detected in the serum of cats worldwide. 7 Moreover, it has been hypothesized that cats have been responsible for transmission of C. burnetii to humans in Q fever outbreaks due to exposure to parturient queens, in which various degrees of seroprevalence have been detected. 7\u00c010 Nagaoka et al. 11 provided the first evidence of active infection, isolating 9 of 29 cases of C. burnetii from vaginal swabs of domestic queens, and C. burnetii DNA was amplified through PCR assay from 3 out of 37 uterine tissues from cats with and without a history of reproductive abnormalities. 12 In canine species, the epidemiological role of C. burnetii infection is still debated; however, seropositivity has been reported in dogs, and human outbreaks associated with parturient bitches have been described. 13, 14 C. burnetii DNA has also been recently detected in 4 of 54 canine placentas originating from aborting animals in The Netherlands. 15 Leptospirosis is a worldwide re-emerging disease caused by a gram-negative bacterium of the genus Leptospira. There are over 250 pathogenic serovars that are adapted to different wild or domestic animal reservoir hosts, and serovars are further grouped into antigenically related serogroups. Infection with pathogenic leptospires can cause a wide range of clinical manifestations from subclinical to severe and potentially lethal disease. 16 However, there are only a few reports of reproductive disorders in dogs related to leptospiral infection; abortion has occurred in dogs after transplacental spread of the serovar Buenos Aires, 17 and a report suggested that abortion was associated with serovar Bratislava infection. 18 Some commercial companies that promote diagnostic devices currently suggest including leptospirosis testing in cases of abortion in dogs. In feline species, seroprevalence of Leptospira spp. varies from 0% to 35% depending on the geographical area and the diagnostic methods used 16 ; however, despite serological evidence, there is little information about clinical leptospirosis in cats. A recent report described 3 confirmed and naturally infected clinical cases of feline leptospirosis presenting with renal failure. 19 Stillbirths, abortions, and retained placenta due to Leptospira spp. also have been reported in queens. 20 The aim of this study was to search for C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. DNA in a retrospective series of cases of canine and feline abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality submitted to a diagnostic laboratory of infectious diseases.",

The plates were incubated for a minimum of 24 hours at 37\u00b0C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Isolation of a pure or predominant bacterial species from all the specimens originating from the same puppy or kitten, was considered a positive result. The identification of bacteria was performed by examining colony characteristics, gram staining, and use of biochemical tests and commercially available API kits (bioMerieux, Etoile, France).

In this study, no evidence of C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. DNA was found in cases of canine and feline abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality submitted for the investigation of infectious causes; in fewer than the half of the cases had an infectious agent already been identified as a possible cause. The presence of C. burnetii and Leptospira has been previously reported in the same geographical area and time frame in which this study was conducted, although in different animal species; leptospiral DNA was found in equine abortion and stillbirth, 25 whereas C. burnetii has been found in sheep in the same area. 26 Moreover, diagnoses of cases of leptospirosis in dogs are reported regularly. 27 According to these previous studies, it might be supposed that our negative results could be related to the fact that cases in dogs and cats not exposed to risk factors for Leptospira spp. and C. burnetii infections were analysed in this study. Indeed, Q fever and coxiellosis are traditionally associated with contact with cattle, sheep, and goats, which are considered the main reservoir of infection. In a previous study, which tested canine sera to detect antibodies for C. burnetii, dogs that had contact with ruminants were 10 times more likely to be positive. 28 On the other hand, it has been observed that dogs living in kennels had a higher prevalence of Leptospira spp. when compared with client-owned dogs, and that, despite vaccination, risk factors for exposure are relevant for the infection. 29 Similarly, in cats, a significantly higher C.burnetii antibody positivity rate was found in stray cats than in pets, 30 and leptospiral antibody prevalence is higher in outdoor cats, as well as in cats living in urban areas and cats that are known hunters. 31 It has been suggested that the active predatory behaviour of some cats increases the chance of infection for both C. burnetii and Leptospira spp., due to contact with reservoirs such as rodents. 7, 16 Unfortunately, in the current study, a serological investigation to establish the exposure to these pathogens was not performed in the bitches and queens, and no indication of breed or lifestyle was specifically requested upon admission of the specimens. Further studies targeting especially populations at risk for these infections should be designed, using animals exposed to water sources or environments contaminated by faeces, urine, or parturition products of animal reservoirs in order to increase the likelihood of finding positive results and determining whether C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. are responsible for canine and feline abortion and neonatal losses.",

Examination of the placenta and umbilical cord is recognized as an important means of diagnosing leptospirosis in some species. 33 In addition, there is strong evidence that the placenta represents the critical tissue also for the detection of C. burnetii, because up to 10 9 C. burnetii per g of placental tissue are released in some species at the time of delivery. 34 These results showed that C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. are probably not common agents of canine abortion or neonatal deaths, whereas a higher number of feline cases is needed to arrive at conclusions. However, considering that reproductive failure can occur following C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. infection, these 2 agents should always be considered in the differential diagnosis in any case of abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality, especially when none of the usually suspected pathogens causing reproductive abnormalities has been identified. 12, 35 Moreover, due to the zoonotic potential of these aetiological agents and the close relationship between companion animals and humans, an active surveillance programme encompassing a larger number of canine and feline abortions/stillbirths/neonatal deaths, including a standardized form for recording signals and investigating some risk factors, could be useful to identify these uncommon agents of abortion and neonatal losses and improve the epidemiological knowledge of them.",
