This oversight contributes to persistent underestimation of infectious disease risk and consequent underinvestment in preparedness and response to infectious disease crises. One reason why economists fail to include economic vulnerability to infectious disease threats in their assessments is the absence of readily available and digestible input data to inform such analysis. In this Viewpoint we suggest an approach by which the global health community can help to generate such inputs, and a framework to use these inputs to assess the economic vulnerability to infectious disease crises of individual countries and regions. We argue that incorporation of these risks in infl uential macroeconomic analyses such as the reports from the International Monetary Fund's Article IV consultations, rating agencies and risk consultancies would simultaneously improve the quality of economic risk forecasting and reinforce individual government and donor incentives to mitigate infectious disease risks.",

For example, looking at the IMF Article IV reports for the 15 countries most aff ected by four of the most substantial infectious disease crises in recent years (SARS, MERS, Ebola, and Zika), none mentioned the risk to economic growth posed by potential infectious disease crises before the outbreaks occurred, whereas most commented on the outbreaks' impact on economic growth after the event took place. In the EIU reports published before the relevant infectious disease outbreaks, only 23 (9%) of 247 reports mentioned the relevant search terms. However, manual review of these 23 instances reveals that most of these mentions referred to the use of terms such as epidemic in a non-infectious disease sense (eg, epidemic of violence).",

Further detail on the analysis used to generate these fi gures is included in the appendix. This is not to say that no assessment of the economic risks of potential pandemics takes place. For example, the World Bank has estimated the costs of an infl uenza pandemic akin to the 1918-19 Spanish infl uenza to be at about 5% of global GDP, or more than $3 trillion. 10 Major reinsurers, such as Swiss Re and Munich Re also publish reports on the risks of pandemics. Yet these are almost invariably high-level assessments of global risk, rather than more granular analyses at a country or regional level taking into account specifi c drivers of vulnerability or varying levels of preparedness. 11-15 Moreover, the results of such thematic analyses are rarely, if ever, refl ected in overall assessment of economic prospects.",

Much macroeconomic risk analysis is written with a focus on Infectious disease risk terms Terrorism-related risk terms Risk the next 12 months, because that is the timeframe of relevance to most recipients, whether in government or the fi nancial markets, given the policy or investment decisions they need to make. This means there might be a limited demand for such analyses to incorporate assessments of certain types of risks, such as high probability, but longer term issues (such as climate change) or low probability, high-impact events (such as pandemics), because the likelihood of them occurring in the timeframe of relevance to the reader is extremely low. Finally, economists seem to be most comfortable assessing risks for which there is good input data and an abundance of theory. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the absence of readily digestible input data is a major reason for the absence of infectious disease risks from mainstream economic analysis. Economists who concede that such risks should be included in their macroeconomic analyses often explain their absence by saying they do not have the expertise or information to include them. To their credit, the IMF have recognised this weakness and are now talking explicitly about the need to incorporate non-economic factors such as climate change and health risks into their overall macroeconomic analyses. So how should the IMF, World Bank, and others go about including the risks from potential pandemics in their regular assessments of countries' economic stability and prospects and of the appropriateness of government policies?

This is not to claim that the historical record is a strong predictor: such data gives an indication of vulnerability, particularly to specifi c pathogens that have already been observed in a country, but provides less help with new pathogens, or ones that might turn up from elsewhere. However, as Jones and colleagues 6 describe, emerging infectious disease events show \"non-random global patterns\"; in other words, history of incidence provides some guide to the future. Moreover, much good work has already been done in recent months to develop more robust historical data, at least for certain pathogens, in the context of the World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Facility. because the triggers and pricing have been informed by detailed analysis of WHO's outbreak data. 18 Second, environmental indicators of vulnerability to specifi c disease threats should be taken into account.

Although the Commission recommended external assessment of specifi ed capabilities and infrastructure for pandemic preparedness and response, it also recognised that these operate as part of, and rely on, the overall health system. For example, weaknesses in delivery of primary care will undermine the ability of the public health system to do disease surveillance and respond eff ectively to outbreaks. Likewise, defi ciencies in infection control procedures in hospitals can turn such institutions into inadvertent accelerators of contagion. WHO already generate forms of intrinsic risk assessments, as do individual countries' public health agencies and various universities and institutes, but not in a way that is easily comparable across countries and across pathogens, and thus readily usable as an input into economic analysis. There are analyses of diff erent countries' susceptibilities to specifi c pathogens. For example, the World Bank produced a preliminary analysis of the potential impact of Zika virus across Latin America and the Caribbean in February, 2016. 8 Some national public health agencies, such as the US Center for Disease Control, or in the UK, Public Health England, produce analyses of their own vulnerability to diff erent infectious disease threats. But all of these analyses use diff erent methods and formats. For the assessment of the strength of the overall health system, various potential sources exist. For example, for primary care, the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI) seeks to provide a comprehensive set of similar metrics. 19 We envisage a matrix with the most threatening infectious diseases on one dimension and countries along the other, with a score of intrinsic vulnerability populated in each cell. Of course, there would be challenges in the implementation of such an approach. To create a composite score of intrinsic vulnerability to specifi c diseases would entail making judgments on the relative importance of diff erent factors. In large countries, substantial variations in vulnerability between diff erent regions could occur. To make the score similar across diff erent diseases would entail making judgments on the relative probabilities and severity of diff erent types of outbreak. Even defi nition of which infectious diseases to include on the matrix would involve some debate (and thought would have to be given as to how to accommodate as yet unknown diseases). But wrestling with such judgments could itself deliver benefi ts, because it would act as a catalyst to data gathering and analysis to support these judgments.",

However, even though this approach, introduced in 2011, represents a substantial improvement on past methods, it still lacks granularity, and because it relies on self-assessment, also lacks credibility. Even on this basis, less than 40% of countries assess themselves to be compliant with IHR2005. 20 To build a more rigorous approach is perfectly feasible. Under the Global Health Security Agenda, a peerbased assessment process has been piloted in fi ve countries. 21 The World Organisation for Animal Health also has a well established system of external assessment of performance against the Terrestrial Animal Health Code.

The Review Committee was tasked to recommend steps to improve the functioning, transparency, eff ectiveness, and effi ciency of the IHR2005. 22 We hope that the committee will recommend the establishment of a robust external assessment mechanism along the lines put forward by the Commission.",

Working with WHO, and potentially with leaders from the relevant industries, the World Bank and IMF should be in a position to develop industry sector coeffi cients of vulnerability to infectious diseases (these might be crude at fi rst, but can be refi ned over time). Together with existing country data on sectoral mix, these coeffi cients can then be used to develop an overall picture of the degree to which a country's economic activity is susceptible to infectious disease risks. As well as providing crucial input into the assessment of economic vulnerability, such an exercise could be used to engage relevant industry leaders in each sector in thinking through their own vulnerabilities and therefore their own priorities in terms of preparedness and response. Having private sector players understand more fully what is at stake and what part they must play is a vital (and often, undermanaged) part of a country's overall strategy for preparedness and response.",

For middle-income countries and the advanced economies, such assessments would sharpen the economic incentive to devote suffi cient resources to pandemic preparedness and response. Finance ministers would view investment in public health capabilities diff erently if these capabilities featured in the IMF's assessment of their country's policy eff ectiveness, or in rating agency assess ments. Funding for pandemic preparedness and response would go from being a problem for the health minister to being fi rmly on the agenda of the fi nance minister as well.

Leaving this responsibility to the private sector or even the multilateral fi nancial institutions to do on their own has not worked in the past and is unlikely to work in the future. Although economists now have a greater awareness of the need to think more systematically about the risks to economic growth and stability from infectious disease crises, neither the private sector nor the multilateral fi nancial institutions have ready access to the inputs required to do such an analysis at the level of individual countries in a rigorous manner. The global health community should therefore work with its partners to provide these inputs, focusing in particular on a consistent approach to assessment of individual countries' intrinsic vulnerability to infectious diseases, and objective, external benchmarking of national core capabilities. The goal is straightforward: making the economic threat posed by economic diseases more visible to policy-makers and the private sector will make it easier to mobilise the resources to prevent and mitigate such risks.",
