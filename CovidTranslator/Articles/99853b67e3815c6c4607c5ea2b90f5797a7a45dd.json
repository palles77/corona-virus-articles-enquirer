More than 15 subtypes of H and 9 subtypes of N are recognized [3] . Many of these affect birds, the common lethal ones being H5 and H7. Different strains are denoted as H1N1, H2N2, H3N1, H5N1, H5N2 etc depending on the combinations of these two antigenic variants. The influenza viruses are irregularly shaped spherical particles and have a lipid envelop from the surface of which the 'H' and 'N' glycoproteins project. 'H' is the site by which viruses bind to cell entry. 'N' helps in shedding of Progeny virions from the infected cells [3] . The structure of Influenza virus is depicted in Fig. 1 .",

Recent outbreaks of avian influenza A (H5N1) in poultry throughout Asia have had major economic and health repercussions. First documented human infection with avian influenza virus was in 1997 in Hong Kong where 18 people were affected out of which 4 died.

These countries were Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Pakistan [1] . The occurrence of this disease in humans and reports of death awakened the health authorities globally to the impending disaster. Not only this virus is deadly to human beings, it can also have a devastating impact on booming economies. In a rough estimate severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) epidemic costed South East Asian countries 59 billion dollars in 2003 while it is feared that during cell division. These uncorrected errors change the genetic composition of viruses leading to new antigenic variants. These constant, permanent and usually small changes in antigenic composition constitute the phenomenon of \"drift\". However, a second and a more dangerous phenomenon occurs in which influenza viruses, including subtypes from different species can swap or reassort genetic material and merge. This is known as \"shift\" and can result in a subtype different from both parent viruses. These variants can cause highly lethal pandemic as the population would have no immunity against them and available vaccines would be ineffective [4] . Such antigenic shifts can occur when humans live close to domestic poultry and pigs. Pigs, being capable of harbouring both mammalian and avian strains of influenza virus, can serve as \"mixing vessels\" in which scrambling of genetic material can occur. Evidence is also emerging that even humans can serve as mixing vessels for almost 15 avian influenza virus subtypes. Once this mixing occurs, the virus acquires the capacity of human-to-human transmission [2] .",

Through them transmission occurs to domestic poultry which are very susceptible.
