The currently-approved drugs for CHB, including the nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) and pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN), rarely achieve functional cure [3] . Dominant challenges in achieving CHB cure are presented by the stable presence of covalently closed circular DNA within host hepatocytes, and the immune tolerance primarily induced by the high hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) load [ 4 , 5 ] . Thus, functional cure of CHB, characterized by loss of HBsAg and presence of HBsAb, is urgently needed.",

In some patients who displayed a low-level of serum HBsAg under long-term antiviral drug treatment, HBsAg loss was observed after they received add-on PEG-IFN treatment [7] . At the same time, several monoclonal antibodies targeting HBsAg have been developed and are being evaluated at different pre-clinical or clinical stages [8] [9] [10] . These antibodies are capable of reducing serum HBsAg, and therefore may play a pivotal role in combination therapies for CHB functional cure.",

Antiviral drug TDF was given orally to inhibit virus replication, followed by injection of an anti-HBs neutralizing monoclonal antibody (G12), which showed synergistic effect in decreasing viral DNA and serum HBsAg load. At this window stage, HBsAg-anti-HBs complex (mYIC) was administered to stimulate active immune responses, and therapeutic efficacies are shown.",

A single dose of G12 reduced HBsAg to negligible levels in contrast to HBIG or m336 one day after the injection ( Fig. 1 b) . The extremely low levels of serum HBsAg were maintained for more than 20 days, with a rebound after 24 days. The difference in HBsAg levels among the three groups had disappeared by 34 days. In contrast, a reduction in serum HBeAg by G12 did not occur during this monitoring period ( Fig. 1 c) and ALT fluctuation was not observed in these G12-treated mice (supplementary Fig. 1) . Additionally, G12-treated mice exhibited about one log 10 lower serum HBV DNA levels than those that received control m336 or HBIG on day 20 post-infusion ( Fig. 1 d) . HBIG did not show an inhibitory effect in this mouse model, possibly due to a lack of sufficient neutralization antibodies in the polyclonal immunoglobulins.

Interestingly, the pharmacokinetics of G12 varied markedly among the treated mice. G12 concentrations decreased slowly in mice 4, 6, 7, faster in mice 2, 3 and the fastest in mice 1, 5 ( Fig. 1 e) . Plasma HBsAb concentrations, calculated using a Roche Combas 60 0 0, showed identical declining trends (supplementary Fig. 3 ). In addition, at day 24, the concentration of G12 decreased to a very low level in mouse 1 ( Fig. 1 e) . Accordingly, the rebound of HBsAg was only observed in mouse 1 at that time ( Fig. 1 f) . At day 29, mice 1 and 5 that had the lowest levels of G12 displayed HBsAg rebound. Similarly, the four mice (mice 1, 2, 3, 5) that experienced HBsAg rebound at day 34 also had very low levels of G12 antibodies in serum.

Of note, mice 1 and 5, which displayed the fastest G12 clearance, also had much higher levels of MAHA, compared to other mice after 2 weeks of antibody infusion.

As expected, the G12 injection quickly reduced HBsAg to undetectable levels. However, the rebound time of HBsAg was shortened to ten days after the third G12 injection (data not shown), probably owing to the faster G12 clearance by MAHA. Interestingly, after prolonged follow-up, the mice that received three injections of G12 showed gradual clearance of HBsAg. Five out of six mice in the G12 group cleared HBsAg by four months after the first injection ( Fig. 2 b) . By eight months after the first injection, HB-sAg was cleared in all of the G12-treated mice, while more than half of the mice in the control and HBIG groups remained HB-sAg positive ( Fig. 2 c) . Three of six mice in the G12-treated group produced HBsAb, while only one mouse produced HBsAb in the HBIG group and no mouse produced HBsAb in the m336-treated group ( Fig. 2 d) .

Mice were grouped 4 weeks after AAV/HBV1.3 infection and then were given TDF intragastrically throughout the experiment. After 5 days of TDF treatment, mice were sequentially treated with G12 and mYIC or mYIC alone. The dynamics of HBsAg and HBeAg levels were examined at days 5, 12 and 19 after injection ( Fig. 3 c) . Rapid HBsAg loss by day five was observed for both the G12 (TDF + G12) and \"sandwich\" groups (TDF + G12 + mYIC) (supplementary Fig. 5a ).

HB-sAg, which can be present with as high as 10 14 particles/mL in HBV carriers or patients, has been shown to inhibit host immune responses by multiple mechanisms including mediating T cell clonal depletion, exhaustion of HBV-specific T [23] [24] [25] . Thus, clearance of HBsAg is considered a crucial step for restoration of host immunity and achieving functional cure of CHB. Therefore, both rapid and efficient decrease in the load of HBsAg and induction of effective host immunity are the two arms in seeking functional cure. However, among all these strategies, there has not been studies on using active immunization based on transient clearance of HBV and HBsAg \"window stage\".",

A well-designed experimental study in mice found that multiple mouse HBsAb infusions followed with a combination of an HBsAg vaccine and a TLR9 agonist induced HBsAb and HBV-specific CTL responses in the AAV/HBV mice model [18] . However, the mouse antibody was infused with 3-day interval for more than 10 weeks, which needs to be modified to make it a feasible treatment for patients.",

HBsAg-HBsAb immune complex therapeutic vaccine has been established in our laboratory [28] and in phase IIB clinical trials, six injections per month followed for six months have been shown to result in HBeAg seroconversion rates of around 20% [29] . In addition, this vaccine was shown to decrease the percentage of regulatory T cells and to increase T helper cells and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells [19] . Here, adding a mouse version of this therapeutic vaccine to the \"sandwich\" strategy efficiently induced both HBsAgspecific humoral and cellular immune responses. The existence of HBsAb-secreting plasma cells found in the bone marrow was consistent with the high level of HBsAb production and supported the conclusion that the \"sandwich\" strategy indeed triggered effective humoral immune responses. Most importantly, histological studies showed that the \"sandwich\" therapy evoked efficient immune responses in the liver with immune cells infiltrating in the carrier mice's livers. The presence of MHC II + myeloid cells and T cells The \"sandwich\" therapy significantly induced humoral immune response to HBsAg.

In addition, no adverse complications have been reported in CHB patients receiving high-dose HBIG treatment [30] . Although there were immune cells infiltrating in mouse livers in this study, we did not find obvious ALT elevation in the single G12 or \"sandwich\" treated mice. All these previous studies and our present data indicated the safety of the antibody-based therapeutic treatment strategy for CHB patients. However, protocol optimization for improved efficacy and careful evaluation of the safety of the \"sandwich\" strategy in future clinical trials are merited. Fig. 6 .
