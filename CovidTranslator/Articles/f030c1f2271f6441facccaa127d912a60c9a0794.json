Neither can be used without reference to the host, for they apply to the interaction between host and parasite. A virus is pathogenic for a particular host if it can infect that host and produce signs and symptoms of disease in it. But infection is not synonymous with disease; many infections, even with virulent viruses, may be subclinical or inapparent (see Table 9 ). A given strain of virus is said to be more virulent than another if it regularly produces more severe disease in a host in which both strains are pathogenic. Live vaccines are usually attenuated strains, i.e. they are less virulent than the wild-type virus. It is best not to use the word 'virulent' to describe the killing of cultured cells by viruses; the appropriate term is 'cytocidal'. Cytocidal viruses are not invariably highly virulent in intact animals; conversely, noncytocidal viruses like rubella or the leukemia viruses may cause severe disease.",

It has been estimated to account for an average of six episodes per person per annum, up to one third of all calls on general practitioners, and countless millions of lost working hours. Attempts have been made to assess the relative contributions of the various respiratory viruses to the total spectrum of respiratory disease (Fig. 3) . The rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial viruses are the most common agents, usually producing trivial disease of the upper respiratory tract, especially when they infect adults. On the other hand, most of the respiratory infections in young children that are severe enough to require hospitalization are attributable to respiratory syncytial, parainfluenza, and influenza viruses. In respiratory syncytial virus infections of infants, if humoral antibody is present in the absence of local antibody, a more severe reaction may occur, possibly through antigen/antibody deposition on the membrane of alveolar cells.",

            "text": "Most of the respiratory viruses are highly infectious, spreading as droplets generated during coughing, sneezing, talking, etc. Respiratory viral infections have short incubation periods, of the order of 2-5 days. Hence they regularly produce epidemics, especially in the winter and spring. A striking example is the respiratory syncytial virus, which precipitates an abrupt epidemic in infants every winter. More widespread epidemics, which may close schools and factories, are produced every 2-3 yr by influenza A and, somewhat less frequently, by influenza B. Adenovirus types 3, 4, 7, 14, 21 and parainfluenza type 1 occasionally cause limited outbreaks in military camps and other semiclosed communities of young people. The other important respiratory viruses, namely the rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses 1, 2, 5, and 6, and coxsackieviruses A21, A24, B3, and BS, tend rather to be endemic in the community, causing only sporadic cases or occasional small outbreaks. Respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza viruses are so prevalent that the first infections with them usually occur in infancy or early childhood. In contrast, some of the enteroviruses and adenoviruses may not be encountered until adult life. Subclinical infections do not occur nearly as commonly with respiratory viruses as with viruses entering the body by other routes. Acquired immunity to the respiratory viruses tends to be relatively short-lived.. Interferon confers limited protection against all viruses for a few weeks, and specific immunity against the homologous serotype, mediated principally by IgA, persists for perhaps a few years, then wanes. Hence reinfection with the same agent sometimes occurs. Even more significant, however, is the fact that a given syndrome may be caused by a large number of serologically distinguishable agents, showing little or no cross-immunity. Many of the viruses listed in Table 2 can, on occasion, produce disease at any level in the respiratory tract--coryza, pharyngitis, laryngitis, croup, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia (Fig. 4) . For example, respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus type 3 can cause a potentially lethal pneumonitis, bronchiolitis, or croup in infants, but usually little more than a sore throat or common cold-like illness in adults. Indeed, the syndromes merge into one another as the infection moves progressively down the respiratory tract. In general, the disease becomes more serious the lower the virus goes.",

A secondary viremia then follows with focal involvement of the skin and mucous membranes, the appearance of a rash, and onset of symptoms. In mousepox, a primary lesion develops at the site of inoculation. Generalized symptoms and fever are probably caused by antigen-antibody complexes which are found at the end of the incubation period.

Thus, mice infected as adults can be protected by X-irradiation, neonatal thymectomy, antilymphocyte or anti-0 serum, or other immunosuppressive treatments, despite the fact that viral growth is similar in normal and immunosuppressed animals. In normal adult mice the cell-mediated immune response to LCM infection, though beneficial in eliminating virus from organs such as lung, liver, and spleen, is also responsible for lethal inflammatory changes in the brain. Adoptive transfer of immune T cells has been shown to induce lesions in the chorioid plexus and meninges in adult mice infected with LCM virus and immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide treatment. Recipients of immune T cells do not produce significant amounts of antibody before dying of classic LCM disease, thus suggesting that cell-mediated immunity rather than humeral factors is responsible.

However, there is much circumstantial evidence that interferon is important in recovery from viral infection. Decreased interferon production caused by altered temperature, chemical inhibitors, or different viral strains has been correlated with impaired recovery, but the situation is often complex. The virulence of some viruses is associated with a weak interferon response, but in other instances there is no correlation. The responsiveness of infected cells to interferon action may be important. For example, mice of the C3HRV strain are much more resistant than C3H mice to flavivirus infections. Although both produce equal amounts of interferon, the cells of the resistant mice are more susceptible to the action of interferon, i.e. a genetic difference in interferon sensitivity rather than interferon production appears to determine the severity of infection. Several other 'nonspecific' factors involved in resistance may operate at least in part by their effects on interferon production; this appears to be the case with body temperature, with some types of stress, and with the effects of some hormones. Despite the wealth of evidence (a) that interferon is produced as a by-product of most or all viral infections, and (b) that passively administered interferon can protect against certain viruses under limited experimental circumstances, there are some clinical observations which cast doubt on the primacy of the role of interferon in recovery from natural infections and at the same time temper optimism in relation to its possible therapeutic use. Neither natural infections with viruses nor immunization with live attenuated vaccines confers substantial protection against simultaneous or subsequent heterologous viral infections elsewhere in the body. Indeed, certain attenuated viruses can be combined to produce potent multivalent vaccines. Perhaps, under natural circumstances, interferon expedites recovery because transient high concentrations occur in the immediate vicinity of infected cells. It may be impossible, in terms of antiviral therapy, to produce enough interferon in the right place at the right time.",

The coincidence in time between recovery and the appearance of circulating antibodies, and the protection conferred by 'passi~,e immunization' with antiserum given during the incubation period of measles, originally led immunologists to believe that the humoral response was important in promoting recovery. However, the natural experiment of human dysgammaglobulinemia has cast doubt on the importance of antibodies in recovery from viral infection. Though subjects with such B cell deficiencies suffer from recurrent and intractable bacterial infections, which can be partially controlled by the administration of y-globulin, they recover from viral infections in a normal fashion in spite of very low levels of y-globulin and often no detectable production of specific antibodies. By contrast children with congenital or acquired T cell deficiencies are known to be extremely vulnerable to viral infections and often succumb to otherwise, trivial diseases such as measles, varicella, or cytomegalovirus.",

For example, mice infected with sublethal doses of ectromelia virus (a poxvirus) died if they were treated with antilymphocyte or anti-0 serum, apparently as a result of the uncontrolled growth of virus in the liver. Antilymphocyte serum suppresses the CMI response, but not the antibody or interferon responses to ectromelia virus. Transfer of immune splenic lymphocytes to mice infected one day earlier with ectromelia virus caused striking inhibition of viral growth and a fall in viral titer in target organs, the liver and spleen. This protective effect was greatly reduced when transfused cells were first treated with anti-0 serum plus complement, which kills T, but not B, lymphocytes. The recipients of the immune cells did not develop detectable antibody. When mouse hyperimmune anti-ectromelia serum was transfused, antibody reached a high titer in recipients (far higher than that achieved in a normal primary response), and there was some inhibition of viral growth, but no fall in viral titer such as is produced by transfer of immune cells. Passively administered interferon had no effect. Prior irradiation of recipients markedly impaired the antiviral effects of immune cells or hyperimmune serum, probably by inactivating radiosensitive precursors of blood monocytes (macrophages), since in unirradiated recipients monocyte invasion of virus-infected foci in the liver coincided with elimination of the virus. This train of experimental evidence shows that 'sensitized' (i.e. immune) T cells are the primary agents of the antiviral effect and the macrophages collaborate with them in the recovery process. Several mechanisms have been postulated to account for the antiviral effects of sensitized T cells. By liberating lymphokines on exposure to antigens in tissues, they induce the migration and activation of macrophages which, perhaps with the help of opsonizing antibody, phagocytose and digest virions and infected cell debris. Further, sensitized T cells that encounter intact infected cells which bear virus-induced antigens on their surface kill such cells before virus is liberated; such T cell-mediated lysis has been demonstrated in vitro with several viruses. Finally, sensitized lymphocytes may liberate interferon on exposure to antigen, and in some infections this could have a significant local antiviral effect.",

Persistent infections with intermittent acute episodes of disease between which virus is usually not demonstrable: latent infections. The important examples of these are herpes simplex and varicella-zoster, in each of which the causative virus persists in a latent state in association with sensory nerve ganglia, and may periodically, or after a long interval, be activated and produce symptoms (recurrent cold sores or shingles, respectively; see Fig. 8 ). 2. Persistent infections in which virus is always demonstrable and often shed, but disease is either absent, or is associated with immunopathological disturbances: chronic infections.

Conversely, the long incubation periods of some localized infections like warts and molluscum contagiosum are presumably due to slow multiplication of the viruses concerned. An extreme, but poorly understood, case is that of the so-called slow virus infections and the viral leukemias, where the virus-cell interaction is initially noncytocidal and symptoms may not appear for many months or even years after infection.",
