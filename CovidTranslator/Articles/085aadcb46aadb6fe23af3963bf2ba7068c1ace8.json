            "text": "Neutralizing mAbs are now considered as a potential therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of chronic and acute viral infections, including newly emerging viral infections (1) . In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the development of new mAbs with improved neutralizing activity (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Notably, in addition to antirespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) mAb used to treat infant respiratory disease, several mAbs directed against human cytomegalovirus, HIV, influenza, Ebola, and rabies virus are currently engaged in promising clinical trials (1, 3, 9, 14) . While the direct effects of antiviral mAbs on viral propagation have been studied extensively, little attention has been paid to their potential immunomodulatory effects until recently (10, 15, 16) . Using a mouse model of persistent retroviral infection, i.e., the erythroleukemia induced by the murine leukemia virus, FrCasE, we have shown that treatment of infected mice with a highly neutralizing mAb can induce life-long protective immunity (vaccine-like effects) (see ref. 10) . This observation may have major therapeutic implications for humans. Indeed, increased antiviral immune responses after mAb treatments were recently observed in preclinical models of HIV, RSV, and henipavirus infections (see ref. 10) . Moreover, passive immunotherapy with broadly neutralizing mAbs stimulated antiviral antibody responses in HIV-1-infected patients (14) . Similarly, vaccine-like effects have also been documented in preclinical models of cancer immunotherapies (17) (18) (19) as well as in clinical trials using anti-CD20, anti-EGFR, or anti-HER2 mAbs (20) (21) (22) (23) . Yet, neither the mechanisms at play nor the possible long-term protective consequences have been addressed in such clinical trials.",

Neutrophils are innate immunity effector cells with wellestablished microbe-killing activities that are rapidly mobilized upon infection. They are also emerging as orchestrators of innate and adaptive immunities. However, their immunomodulatory activity during antiviral mAb immunotherapies has never been studied. Our data reveal that neutrophils have an essential role in immunotherapy-induced immune protection of infected mice. Unexpectedly, neutrophils have a limited effect in controlling viral propagation upon passive immunotherapy administration, which is mostly mediated by NK cells. Instead, neutrophils operate as essential inducers of a potent host humoral antiviral response. Thus, neutrophils play an unexpected key role in protective immunity induction by antiviral mAbs. Our work opens approaches to improve antiviral immunotherapies, as it suggests that preserving neutrophil functions and counts might be required for achieving mAb-induced protective immunity.",

However, their role in antiviral immunity is still largely unknown. Indeed, most investigations have studied neutrophil functions in viral pathogenesis or in the control of viral propagation through their effector functions, i.e., phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, neutrophil extracellular traps formation, etc. (32, 33) . In contrast, the immunomodulatory properties of neutrophils have been poorly studied in viral infections and not addressed in the context of antiviral immunotherapies.",

Instead, their protective effect relied on their capacity to induce potent humoral responses due to the acquisition of B cell helper activity upon mAb treatment.

To this end, neutrophils were depleted by administering a mAb (1A8) directed to their specific Ly6G cell surface marker (37, 38) or an isotype control mAb (2A3). Depletion started 1 day before infection ( Figure 1A) , was efficient and specific (Supplemental Figure 1 ; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci. insight.97339DS1), and was maintained for 21 days, i.e., the time necessary to eliminate the therapeutic 667 mAb (27) . Neutrophil elimination accelerated disease development in infected/nontreated mice and drastically reduced protection provided by 667 mAb to infected mice ( Figure 1D ). We next assessed viral propagation in the different groups of mice. In infected/nontreated animals, neutrophil depletion ( Figure 2A ) was associated with a significant increase in the percentage of infected spleen cells at days 8 ( Figure 1E ) and 14 p.i. (Supplemental Figure 2A ) as well as with a higher viremia (Supplemental Figure 2B ). In contrast, in infected/ treated mice, viral propagation was not significantly affected at days 8 ( Figure 1E ) and 14 p.i. (Figure 2B and Supplemental Figure 2 ) upon neutrophil depletion and remained lower than in infected/nontreated mice. This suggested that viral control by 667 mAb involved other innate immunity effector cells.",

As NK cells can exert antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity against infected cells exposing determinants such as the retroviral Env protein (27, 39, 40) , we asked whether NK cells were involved in the control of viral propagation in infected/treated mice. To this end, NK cells were depleted using an anti-asialo-GM1 antibody (41) (42) (43) (44) (Figure 2A ). In contrast to neutrophil depletion, the absence of NK cells in infected/treated mice led to a significantly increased viral propagation at day 14 p.i. ( Figure 2B ). Next, we compared 667 mAb-mediated ADCC activity of NK cells and neutrophils with infected cells using an in vivo antibody-mediated killing assay, relying on the administration of 667 mAb-opsonized FrCasE-infected splenocytes in naive mice (27) (Figure 2C ). Depletion of NK cells, but not neutrophils, led to reduced mAb-mediated infected cell lysis ( Figure 2D ). Finally, as NK cells are crucial for viral propagation control during the immunotherapy period, we assessed their role in the protection against leukemia in infected/treated mice. Importantly, NK cell depletion drastically reduced survival of immunotreated mice ( Figure 2E ), indicating that antibody-mediated control of viral propagation by NK cells is necessary for long-term antiviral protection.",

To this end, we measured the frequency of CD3 -NKp46 + cells in the spleens of mice from the different groups. The CD3 -Nkp46 + population contains mostly NK cells but may also include ILC1 and a subpopulation of ILC3 cells. NK cells can be distinguished from such ILCs using the cell surface marker CD49b (46) . Notably, over 95% of CD3 -NKp46 + cells were CD49b + (Supplemental Figure 3 ), indicating that the vast majority of CD3 -NKp46 + cells in the spleen displayed a NK phenotype. As shown in Figure 3A , CD3 -NKp46 + cell recruitment in spleens of both infected/nontreated and infected/ treated mice at day 14 p.i. was similar and stronger than in naive mice. We also observed that neutrophils were involved in CD3 -NKp46 + cell mobilization in infected/nontreated mice but not in infected/treated or in naive mice ( Figure 3A ). We next assessed the frequency of splenic ILCs other than NK cells by quantifying CD117 and CD127 expression in the NKp46 + spleen cell population lacking the common lymphoid and myeloid lineage-associated (Lin-associated) markers (Lin -) (47) .

To achieve this, anti-FrCasE serum Igs from mice of the different groups were assayed by ELISA. Virus-specific IgM titers were assayed at 14 days p.i. (i.e., at the peak of the IgM response upon FrCasE infection and 667 mAb treatment; Supplemental Figure 4 ) and were not significantly different between infected/nontreated and infected/treated mice ( Figure 5A ). Interestingly, neutrophil depletion did not alter virus-specific IgM titers in either infected/nontreated or infected/treated mice ( Figure 5A ). In agreement with published studies in other experimental settings, the absence of neutrophils did not affect the levels of IgM (48) . On the contrary, and consistent with our previous work (27) , infected/treated mice displayed a much higher level of anti-FrCasE IgGs than infected/nontreated animals ( Figure 5B ), with a peak (700 \u03bcg/ml) by day 68 p.i. and a still high level (100 \u03bcg/ml) at the end of the experiment. Interestingly, in the absence of neutrophils, serum concentration of antiviral IgGs dramatically decreased in infected/ treated mice ( Figure 5B and Supplemental Figure 5 ). In contrast, neutrophils showed no role in the regulation of the poor nonprotective antibody response elicited in infected/nontreated mice ( Figure 5B ). Importantly, high anti-FrCasE IgG seric levels correlated with longer survival times, supporting a role for the high humoral antiviral response in protection against disease ( Figure 5C ). To further characterize the long-term virus-specific humoral response, we tested whether infected/treated mice, depleted or not of neutrophils, could respond to a virus challenge performed 3 months after the first infection (i.e., a time point at which the primary humoral response has strongly declined). Infected/treated mice, depleted or not of neutrophils, were inoculated with FrCasE, and serum samples were collected 1 week later to assay the generation of endogenous anti-FrCasE antibodies. In the presence of neutrophils, 3 of 5 infected/treated mice showed an increase in the virus-specific humoral response ( Figure 5D ), while, in the absence of neutrophils, none of the infected/treated mice responded to the viral challenge. Altogether, these results show that neutrophil depletion at early time points after infection and treatment affects humoral immunity with an effect on both primary and memory virus-specific B cell responses.",

In infected/treated and infected/nontreated mice, splenic neutrophils were similarly activated, as deduced from CD62L shedding and increased expression of CD11b ( Figure 7A ). However, neutrophils from infected/treated mice showed a significantly stronger expression of two cytokines involved in B cell activation, B cell-activating factor (BAFF) and lymphotoxin \u03b1 (LT\u03b1), compared with infected/nontreated animals ( Figure 7B ), suggesting a role for the therapeutic mAb in the functional activation of neutrophils. Splenic neutrophils sorted from infected/treated mice also showed a trend for higher secretion capacity of BAFF and LT\u03b1, as compared with infected/nontreated mice neutrophils, even though such a trend did not reach statistical significance. To further assess whether mAb triggering (through Fc\u03b3R cross-linking) could enhance BAFF and LT\u03b1 release by neutrophils, we isolated BM neutrophils from naive mice and stimulated them for 24 hours in plates coated with the 667 mAb. Experiments were conducted in the presence or the absence of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 to assess the extent to which inflammatory conditions could synergize with 667 mAb triggering. Interestingly, in the presence of IFN-\u03b3, 667 mAb triggering led to a significantly increased release of BAFF and LT\u03b1 by neutrophils ( Figure 7C ). In summary, FrCasE infection activates neutrophils independently of immunotherapy. However, the activation state substantially differs between the two groups of animals, notably with a significantly stronger expression of LT\u03b1 and BAFF in immunotherapy-treated mice. In addition, inflammatory conditions synergize with mAb-mediated activation of neutrophils leading to an enhanced release of BAFF and LT\u03b1.",

Thus, our work indicates that both innate effector cells have distinct but complementary roles in the protection of infected mice by mAb; NK cells have an early and predominant role in the control of viral spread, while neutrophils are essential for the emergence of a potent host antiviral humoral response.

Interestingly, the absence of neutrophils during the immunotherapy period in infected mice also leads to impaired development of secondary humoral responses upon viral challenge. Overall, our data suggest that neutrophils are essential for antiviral protection due to their B cell helper activity. Similarly, such a helper function has already been documented under homeostatic conditions (51), in autoimmunity disease-prone mice (52), during emergency granulopoiesis (53) , and in bacterial infection (54) .

Together with the fact that MZ B cells can favor the generation of plasma cells upon microbial infection (49) , it is reasonable to speculate that BAFF induction in neutrophils of infected/treated mice may also favor the MZ B cell response and the subsequent generation of plasma cells. Interestingly, in agreement with our in vitro results showing enhanced BAFF release by neutrophils after a combination of IFN-\u03b3 stimulation and Fc\u03b3R cross-linking ( Figure 7C ), different proinflammatory stimuli, including ICs, have been shown to act as secretagogues and to synergize with IFN-\u03b3 to enhance BAFF secretion by human neutrophils (62) . Moreover, neutrophil depletion in autoimmunity-prone mice led to a reduction of autoantibodies titers that correlated with decreased serum levels of IFN-\u03b3 and BAFF (52) . Thus, it can reasonably be hypothesized that inflammatory conditions synergize with ICs formed after 667 mAb treatment of FrCasE-infected mice to enhance BAFF release by neutrophils.",

            "text": "Although not formally shown, our data suggest that LT\u03b1 release by neutrophils might play a role in the enhancement of the antiviral humoral response in infected/treated mice. LT\u03b1 is involved in the formation of secondary lymphoid organs, is expressed by lymphocytes, and mediates a large variety of inflammatory and antiviral responses. It has also been reported to play a role in the development of GC formation and to be required for IgG responses (63) (64) (65) . Here, we show that this cytokine is expressed and released by neutrophils upon mAb treatment of infected mice. Interestingly, although LT\u03b1 is not known to be expressed by neutrophils, it has been proposed that nonlymphocytic murine splenic cells are able to produce it (66) . We also report that Fc\u03b3R cross-linking by immobilized 667 mAb synergizes with IFN-\u03b3 to enhance LT\u03b1 release by neutrophils. This suggests that, similarly to BAFF, inflammatory conditions and mAb triggering might lead to increased LT\u03b1 secretion by neutrophils. Further studies will be required to address whether BAFF and LT\u03b1 combine their actions to stimulate the antiviral humoral response upon mAb immunotherapy. Finally, as IFN-\u03b3 potentiates BAFF and LT\u03b1 release, it will also be important to assess whether and how neutrophil-dependent IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells in infected/treated mice contributes to the stimulation of antibody responses, as this cytokine affects class-switching and long-term maintenance of neutralizing antibody titers in retrovirally infected mice (34) and humoral autoimmunity in humans (67) .",

            "text": "Identifying neutrophils as key players in the induction of protective immunity by antiviral mAbs has important therapeutic implications for several reasons. First, if combination therapies are considered, it will be of utmost importance that the agent(s) coadministered with the passive immunotherapy do not alter neutrophil functions and counts to avoid inhibiting efficient antiviral humoral immune responses. Second, in pathological situations leading to neutropenia and/or impaired neutrophils functions, such as certain viral infections (68, 69) and/or drug-induced neutropenia (70) , it will be essential to restore them. This could, for example, be achieved through administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a cytokine already used in the clinic to treat neutropenic patients. Interestingly, this cytokine might also be used in combination with treatments aiming at enhancing the generation of functional neutrophils (70) . Furthermore, beyond stimulating neutrophil activation and/or mobilization, G-CSF enhances neutrophil BAFF secretion capacity and, thereby, the ability of neutrophils to stimulate B cells (71) . Similarly, reduction of viral load by antiretroviral therapies also permits partial restoration of the impaired functions of neutrophils observed in HIV-infected patients (68) . Interestingly, neutrophils have been shown to mediate immunosuppression via the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway in HIV-infected patients (72) . Antiviral passive immunotherapies might therefore benefit from combination with the administration of mAbs targeting this immune checkpoint. Finally, alternative approaches, such as engineering the Fc fragment of antiviral mAbs, merit consideration. Increasing their affinity for the Fc\u03b3Rs expressed by neutrophils might, at first, allow superior antibody-mediated phagocytosis, as recently reported in the case the Fc-modified VR01 anti-HIV mAb (73) . This could then alter cell signaling and cytokine/chemokines production to ultimately lead to more effective adaptive immune responses. Thus, stimulating neutrophil activity, restoring their impaired functions, and/ or counteracting their immunosuppressive actions should improve the vaccine-like effects of antiviral mAb-based immunotherapies. This might also apply to cancer treatment as enhancement of antitumoral immune responses has also been observed in mAb-based anticancer immunotherapies. This is all the more important to take into consideration, as neutrophils have been shown to play a role in the therapeutic activity of anticancer mAb (74) (75) (76) (77) (78) .",

Briefly, red blood cell-free splenocytes were recovered from 10-day-old FrCasE-infected, or noninfected, pups. Splenocytes from noninfected mice were labeled with the vital dye carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Molecular Probes) at a concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM (CFSE lo cells). Splenocytes from infected mice were labeled with 5 \u03bcM CFSE (CFSE hi cells) and preincubated, or not, with the 667 mAb (the absence of 667 mAb allowed quantification of spontaneous cell death). Both cell populations were mixed at a 1:1 ratio before retro-orbital administration to recipient mice. Cytolysis activity against infected splenocytes was calculated from the ratio of CFSE lo /CFSE hi cells in spleen assayed by flow cytometry 5 hours later. To assess the contribution of NK cells and neutrophils to antibody-mediated cytolysis, 50 \u03bcl of the anti-asialo GM1 or 200 \u03bcg of the anti-Ly6G 1A8 mAb were administered 1 day prior to the assay.",
