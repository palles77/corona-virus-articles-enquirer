Examination of the genome of the 1918 virus (5, 6) has not provided complete answers; however, it has posed difficult new questions and has raised the possibility of alternative mechanisms of generation (11) . Whereas all eight gene segments of the 1918 virus are clearly avian-like, they are genetically distinct from any of the hundreds of avian or mammalian influenza viruses collected and examined between 1917 and 2009. The differences are primarily caused by greater-thanexpected numbers of silent nucleotide changes. Furthermore, the genes of the 1918 virus apparently evolved together in parallel, possibly in an unidentified host (7) . Unlike the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, each of which resulting from reassortment between circulating descendants of the 1918 human virus and circulating avian influenza strains (12) , the 1918 pandemic may well have arisen by de novo genetic adaptation of an existing avian virus to a new (human) host (6, 7, 9) .",

Reassortment importation of avian influenza and other swine influenza genes into the North American descendant before the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic further adds to the genetic diversity of this virus. Although the 2009 H1N1 virus is a multiple reassortant hybrid virus containing swine, human, and avian influenza viral genes, it has been evolving in full view of modern genetic surveillance for more than a decade. Its origin and evolution can be traced back to the 1930s and, by inference, to 1918.",

            "text": "The lack of influenza virus sequence data before 1918 obscures the origin of the 1918 pandemic virus. However, at least two different H1N1 influenza strains with markedly different receptor-binding specificities, both fatal to humans, were circulating simultaneously in 1918 (14) . One strain contained variations in both the 190 and 225 codons (E190D and D225G) of the H1 gene. These changes enable the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the virus to bind only to (2-6) \u03b1-sialic acid receptors typically found on mammalian cells. The second circulating strain contained only the E190D change, rendering it capable of binding to both mammalian (2-6) \u03b1 receptors and avian (2-3) \u03b1-sialic acid receptors (15, 16) . The ultimate avian ancestor of the 1918 virus was likely a low pathogenicity strain, because the viral hemagglutinin lacks the polybasic cleavage site mutation characteristic of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, as found in the current H5N1 lineages. Thus, even if the 1918 precursor virus had circulated widely in wild or domestic bird species before the 1918 pandemic, avian die-offs would not have been expected. The 1918 H1N1 and the current H5N1 influenza viruses thus seem to be evolutionarily quite different.",

To older physicians in 1918, obvious similarities to the 1889 pandemic included its highly contagious nature, with clinical attack rates typically ranging between 20% and 60%. In both pandemics, most deaths resulted from respiratory complications, usually pneumonia with bacterial invasion; however, in 1918 some observers suggested new and severe clinical forms of disease. Many 1889 pneumonia deaths had been attributed to familiar conditions such as subacute bacterial lobar pneumonia, whereas this background influenza mortality was seemingly augmented in 1918 by more frequent cases of aggressive fatal bronchopneumonia and deaths associated with progressive cyanosis and collapse. Some modern scientists have theorized that such 1918 deaths might be immunopathogenic in nature (e.g., caused by \"cytokine storms\"), although many data from that era suggest that almost all deaths resulted from secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia of a clinical type, spectrum, course, and lethality characteristic of pneumonias not associated with influenza (18).",

Most countries experienced waves only in October 1918 and February 1919, but a few countries, mostly Northern European, had an additional earlier wave in summer 1918 (22) . Some countries documented single waves of disease, a delay in initial pandemic detection of up to 3 yrs beyond 1918, or, in rare cases, documented no illness at all. Furthermore, mortality rates in the latter two of the three 1918 to 1919 waves were much higher than in 1889 for all ages except the elderly, and the 1918 to 1919 pandemic also featured an enormous still-unexplained mortality in healthy young adults (Fig. 1B) , an age group believed to have been at low risk for death in most other pandemics up to that time.",

The most common appears to have been acute aggressive bronchopneumonia featuring tracheobronchial epithelial necrosis, alveolar edema, and hyaline membrane formation, and, less frequently, small vessel thrombi, microvascular necrosis, and hemorrhage. Pathologic changes were focal and widely variant in different parts of the lung, from which pathogenic bacteria could also usually be cultured at autopsy ( Fig. 2A and B ) (18, 32) . In a few autopsies, severe bronchopneumonia was seen without evidence of bacteria, sometimes in association with an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like illness; however, studies generally showed a close correlation between the distribution of pneumonia lesions and cultured bacteria (38, 39) . The major bacteria identified in the pandemic were the organisms now called Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and, less commonly, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (26, (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) .",

The bronchial tree appeared to be the primary organ of involvement in severe 1918 influenza cases; when bacterial invaders in the nasopharynx gained access to the peripheral bronchial tree by direct extension along denuded bronchial epithelium, bronchopneumonia could then occur (18) . Such secondary bacterial infection may be a general mechanism of severe influenza pathogenesis, because it has been seen in many fatal cases of seasonal influenza since 1918. Even today, a significant number of deaths caused by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic likely can be directly attributed to this mechanism of disease (45) .",

Curves of influenza mortality by age at death are typically U-shaped, reflecting high mortality in the very young and the very old, with low mortality at all ages between (7) . The 1918 to 1919 pandemic and succeeding winter epidemic recurrences in 1919 and 1920 (21) instead produced W-shaped mortality curves, which featured a third mortality peak in healthy young adults that accounted for approximately half of the total influenza deaths, including the majority of excess influenza deaths ( Fig. 1B and 3 ",

Another viral cause of severe ARDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (48) , especially in association with the North American Sin Nombre virus, features an unexplained preponderance of cases in young adults, which appears not to be attributable solely to higher rates of exposure (49, 50) .

This hypothesis is bolstered by recent observations of fatal human H5N1 cases (53) , experimental H5N1 studies in macrophages (54) , and other information on immunopathogenesis (55, 56) , all of which suggest that human infection with influenza viruses, including the 1918 virus (57, 58) , can result in excessive cytokine release. Experimental animal studies of reconstructed 1918 influenza virus infection also have shown marked up-regulation of acute inflammatory cytokines (57) (58) (59) (60) . For example, intranasal challenge of mice with the reconstituted 1918 virus led to a highly lethal and rapidly progressing pulmonary disease characterized by high viral growth; a histologic picture of necrotizing bronchitis/bronchiolitis, alveolitis, alveolar hemorrhage, and edema; and overexpression of acute inflammatory cytokines (59) . Comparison of pathologic findings in 1918 to 1919, cases of fatal human H5N1 infections (53) , and two unrelated viral pulmonary diseases thought to be associated with cytokine storms-severe acute respiratory syndrome (61, 62) and severe hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (48, 63)-suggest that they differ pathologically but that ARDS may be a common end point. However, it also must be remembered that most severe cases of influenza-related pulmonary disease in 1918 featured both severe bronchopulmonary tissue damage and severe secondary bacterial infection (7), and that without antibiotics such infections could not be adequately treated.",

In this regard, antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, which has been suspected as a cause of dengue hemorrhagic fever in association with second dengue infections, has been demonstrated in vitro with influenza viruses (64) . Alternatively, the Wshaped mortality pattern could be consistent with an environmental exposure peculiar to young adults (e.g., smoking, aspirin use); however, this possibility has not been well-studied (65) . Thus, the 1918 W-shaped mortality curve and the extremely high death rate in young adults remain to be fully explained.",

However, protection of older adults in 2009 is much greater than it was in 1918, and that protection from death is attributable, at least in part, if not wholly, to protection from infection in the first place. To date, no evidence exists of increased severity/increased fatality in young adults; in fact, the risk of death to a single infected individual is higher in older persons, a group in which attack rates of 2009 H1N1 have so far been extremely low but in which higher case fatality rates have been seen in almost all influenza pandemics and seasonal influenza epidemics in the past.",

This lower-than-expected mortality among individuals who were older than 45 yrs in 1918 implies partial protection from disease and, perhaps, from infection [2] [3] [4] 6] . This lower mortality rate might be attributable to previous exposure to antigenically related influenza viruses (68, 69) , similar to what may be causing the reduction of attack rates of the 2009 H1N1 in the elderly (70) . Yet, other than regional outbreaks (71, 72) and an 1872 American epizootic of equine influenza associated with only mild human illnesses (73, 74) , there is little evidence for major interpandemic influenza events in the three decades before 1889 (75) . Furthermore, none of the three pandemics in the century before 1918 (in the 1830s, 1847, and 1889) are thought to have been associated with multiple, rapidly successive waves or W-shaped mortality curves (7, 19, 20, (76) (77) (78) (79) (80) (81) (82) (83) (84) .",

Evidence is consistent with the possibility that the influenza pandemics of 1830 to 1831, 1833 to 1834, and 1836 to 1837 could have been caused by one pandemic virus whose recurrences spanned 2-yr intervals (84) , and that the restricted 1847 pandemic may have represented a return of that pandemic virus. The 1847 pandemic appears to have been inter-regional but not global, sparing the Western hemisphere, at least from 1847 to 1849 (84) . The 1889 pandemic was too recent to have offered protection only for older individuals in 1918 and may have been caused by an H3 influenza virus (46) . The possibility of immunoprotection mediated in 1918 by neuraminidase, rather than by HA, is intriguing (85) , but few data support this possibility because the identity of the 1889 neuraminidase is unknown.",

Presumably, such age shifting has resulted from the widespread circulation of human H1N1 viruses after 1918 and, conceivably, also to seasonal H1N1 influenza vaccines. Although accurate data are still lacking, it would not be surprising if the current pandemic results in high case-fatality rates but low population mortality rates among older persons; that is, few older persons would have disease but those who did would still face a substantial risk of severe disease and death. Preliminary data suggest the possibility of 2009 H1N1 protection against infection in persons older than 40 yrs and, independently, against death in those older than approximately 60 yrs (89).",

Unlike all previous and subsequent influenza pandemics, the 1918 to 1919 pandemic seems to have spread in up to three distinct \"waves\" within a 9-mo period. Not all influenza pandemics have had such prominent recurrences, and those that did tended to return at yearly intervals (e.g., 1889-1893), making them difficult to distinguish in kind if not in impact from normal seasonal influenza (7, 90) . Globally, the first wave of the 1918 pandemic (W1), as measured by pneumonia and influenza mortality, occurred in only a few mostly Northern European countries in the summer of 1918 (as recognized in the Northern hemisphere), largely in July and August, and was associated with modest mortality. The two following waves in summer to autumn 1918 (W2) and winter 1918 to 1919 (W3) were seen in most of the world. Both were more deadly than the first wave (Fig. 1A) (4, 21, 22) , perhaps because of higher attack rates or higher case-fatality rates. As noted, almost all countries experienced only one or two waves (approximately October 1918 and February-March 1919), although several other confusing patterns also were seen, including summer to autumn 1918 epidemics with very low mortality and fatal waves delayed for several years beyond 1918.",

Conceivably, viral, host, and environmental factors may interact in complex ways, e.g., a changing balance between aerosol vs. droplet/contact/fomite transmission during different seasons, expressed in the context of gradual virus evolution and growing population immunity.",

After the 1889 to 1893 pandemic, interest in examining such influenza recurrence patterns was renewed (93) but the unexpected emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic has again demonstrated difficulties in prediction of cycles. By the 1950s, cumulative historical information (2-4, 71, 72, 76-83) seemed to confirm the notions of early 18th and 19th century observers that pandemics appear in regular cycles. At that time, this seemed to make biological sense. Before the current pandemic, the most recent pandemics (in 1889, 1918, and 1957) had apparently been caused by different viruses with novel HA genes imported from a large, naturally existing avian pool. At approximately the same time, high population immunity seemed to pressure postpandemic viruses to drift antigenically, and surface protein-encoding genes potentially could mix with other HA and neuraminidase genes, to which humans lacked immunity (94) . Given these facts, it was reasonable to assume that such an intimate viral-immunologic relationship would have a predictable life span.",

There is no reason to suppose that these three different pandemic mechanisms could produce the same cyclic intervals or that other competing adaptation mechanisms, such as reassortment with closely related HA (99, 100) or viral drift caused by changing population immunity induced by natural infection and increasing use of immunologically complex vaccines, could not disrupt cycles that might otherwise occur.

At the time of the 1918 pandemic, the underlying cause was unknown and thus there was little scientific basis for specific treatment. Convalescent plasma was tried (109), as were immune serums against known serotypes of complicating secondary bacterial invaders, including anti-Pneumococcal and anti-Streptococcal serums, but neither demonstrated conclusive evidence of efficacy. Treatment of influenza in 1918 consisted largely of supportive nursing care, which by all accounts did decrease mortality rates. Today, a robust combination of pharmaceuticals, technology, and treatment algorithms are available to identify and treat patients at high risk and those who are severely ill. This level of medical care was unavailable in 1918, and much of it was unavailable in 1957 and 1968 as well. Today, we have increased public awareness, preventive strategies, and better/earlier diagnostic and treatment modalities of many chronic diseases in general. We can now identify patients at high risk for severe or complicated influenza and target them for early prevention, prophylaxis, or treatment, including administration of vaccines and antivirals.",

Almost all severely ill and hospitalized patients are treated with antivirals, but the clinical effects have been modest, and their utility in reducing mortality in a pandemic is unclear.

It is often said that there is little role for early pandemic detection and early public health intervention, but such recent events as the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and the current 2009 influenza pandemic make this notion untenable. Although it is true that in an age of high-volume air travel, global spread of a pandemic influenza virus can proceed rapidly and can be impossible to control, even in 1918, before the age of commercial air travel, the virus was transmitted rapidly during the second wave, affecting most of the world within a matter of a few weeks. Today, the most difficult challenge is not pandemic detection or medical knowledge about treatment and prevention, but medical capacity, resource availability (hospital beds, medical personnel, drugs, and supplies), and public health and community crisis responses to an event in which up to half of the population could become ill within a few weeks.",

Truly universal influenza vaccines based on either immunogenic antigens shared by all influenza viruses (121) or multivalent HA and neuraminidases (122) , both currently undergoing development, would provide broad protection. In the meantime, multidisciplinary approaches that include preventive medicine, treatment of acute and chronic disease, and good public health measures remain important components of any pandemic preparedness strategy. Furthermore, efforts must be directed toward prevention based on improved understanding of pandemic risks, increased surveillance, development of countermeasures, logistic planning, and an aggressive and broad research agenda.",

            "text": "Influenza research over the past decade has looked both forward and backward in time to identify virus transmission patterns, e.g., the remarkable evolution of several related pandemic viruses that have circulated during the past century (97) . The more we learn about these viruses and their deadly relationship with the human species, the more remarkable they seem. The next decade should yield significant advances in fundamental knowledge and, more importantly, in prevention and control. Today, nearly a century after the event, mysteries surrounding the 1918 influenza pandemic remain largely unexplained and pandemics continue to emerge. We must continue to examine this long-ago tragedy, allowing it to stand clearly before us as a challenge to complacency, as a modern problem with future implications, and as a grim reminder of the importance of continuing the fight against emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Histologic appearance of lung sections from two fatal cases of 1918 influenza, showing distinct clinical-pathologic forms. A, Some deaths, probably a minority, were associated with a severe and rapidly progressing clinical form thought to be similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (8), which had not been characterized at that time. These patients had rapid progression and fluid-filled alveoli, although they also frequently had concomitant bacterial bronchopneumonia in other sections of the lungs. B, The majority of deaths in 1918 to 1919 appear to have been associated with severe bacterial bronchopneumonia from which Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, or, less commonly, Staphylococcus aureus could be cultured. The extent to which secondary bacterial pneumonia may have followed primary viral pneumonia is unclear, but most cases with histologic evidence of bacterial pneumonia also showed focal areas consistent with primary viral changes, as in (A). Hematoxylin & eosin stain; original magnifications 200\u00d7. U-shaped and W-shaped combined influenza and pneumonia mortality, by age at death, per 100,000 persons in each age group, US, 1911 to 1918. Influenza/pneumonia-specific death rates are plotted for the years before the pandemic, ie, 1911 to 1917 (blue line), and for the pandemic year 1918 (red line) (7, 66, 67) . Influenza pandemic occurrence, 1500 to 2009. Information was compiled from historical references (69, 70, (74) (75) (76) (77) (78) (79) (80) (81) (82) (101) (102) (103) (104) and scientific publications from 1889 to the present (not cited). Interpandemic intervals are noted on the top of the figure. Pandemics are associated with abrupt and widespread epidemicity in multiple locales in two or more geographic regions, rapid progression through large open populations, high clinical illness rates affecting a broad age range, and no other pandemic activity within 5 yrs (to adjust for the possibility of slow and interrupted pandemic spread before the mid 19th century). Especially before 1697, pandemics may be difficult to verify and track because of slower spread (86) as a result of slower and less frequent human travel. Some cited sources suggest different interpretations than those presented here (see text) (71, 72, (76) (77) (78) (79) (80) (81) (82) (83) (84) (98) (99) (100) (101) . *The 1977 re-emergence and global spread of an \"extinct\" descendant of the 1918 pandemic virus is included here as a pandemic emergence, although it might also be considered to reflect continuing spread of the original pandemic virus.",

The figure is reproduced from data of Lubinski(21), on which we have superimposed indications of the three 1918 to 1919 \"waves\" (W1, W2, and W3) and the first three annual winter postpandemic recurrences of 1919 to 1920 (R1), 1920 to 1921 (R2), and 1921 to 1922 (R3). B, Age-specific influenza mortality, Breslau, October 1918 to April 1922. The dark blue line combines influenza mortality in W2 and W3 of 1918 to 1919. The light blue line reflects influenza mortality in the first winter recurrence of January to April 1920 (R1). The orange line reflects influenza mortality in the R3 winter recurrence of December 1921 to April 1922. The young adult mortality peak, documented worldwide, is evident in the W2 + W3 and R1 curves of 1919 to 1921 but has completely disappeared by 1922.",
