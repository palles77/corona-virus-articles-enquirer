            "text": "Special Features S epsis, acute lung injury (ALI), and ARDS all contribute substantially to the expanding burden of critical illness within the United States. Epidemiologic estimates suggest an incidence of 200,000 patients annually for ALI/ARDS, 1,2 with a comparably large and growing incidence of sepsis. 3 The morbidity and mortality of these disease processes likewise are staggering. In-hospital death rates range from 26% to 38% in studies of ARDS, 1,2 whereas sepsis kills nearly one-half of those severely affected. 4 For patients who ultimately survive their initial hospitalization, quality of life often is dramatically reduced, and the economic impact is considerable. Sepsis, for instance, contributes nearly $17 billion toward the burgeoning costs of US critical care delivery. 5 From a pathophysiologic perspective, sepsis, ALI, and ARDS are all characterized by abnormally enhanced coagulation, dysregulated and often injurious host immunity, microvascular dysfunction, and tissue necrosis. Increasing evidence suggests that hematologic derangements are associated with and may be important contributors to disease severity, largely infl uenced by alterations in platelet and leukocyte function. 6 Although platelet-mediated thrombosis has been implicated in their pathobiology, a host of other platelet-associated effects can infl uence their natural history. Understanding the pluripotential impact of platelets in immunopathology and their specifi c role in the development and progression of Sepsis, acute lung injury, and ARDS contribute substantially to the expanding burden of critical illness within our ICUs. Each of these processes is characterized by a myriad of injurious events, including apoptosis, microvascular dysfunction, abnormal coagulation, and dysregulated host immunity. Only recently have platelets-long considered merely effectors of thrombosis-been implicated in infl ammatory conditions and the pathobiology of these disease processes. A growing body of evidence suggests a prominent role for maladaptive platelet activation and aggregation during sepsis and ARDS and has begun to underscore the pluripotential infl uence of platelets on outcomes in critical illness. Not only do platelets enhance vascular injury through thrombotic mechanisms but also appear to help orchestrate pathologic immune responses and are pivotal players in facilitating leukocyte recruitment to vulnerable tissue. These events contribute to the organ damage and poor patient outcomes that still plague the care of these high-risk individuals. An understanding of the role of platelets in critical illness also highlights the potential for both the development of risk stratifi cation schema and the use of novel, targeted therapies that might alter the natural history of sepsis, acute lung injury, and ARDS. Future studies of adenosine, platelet polyphosphates, and the platelet transcriptome/proteome also should add considerably to our ability to unravel the mysteries of the versatile platelet.",

There are four main phases governing platelet function: (1) activation, (2) adhesion, (3) aggregation, and (4) secretion. Under the influence of substances, including thrombin, collagen, epinephrine, vasopressin, platelet-activating factor, and arachidonic acid metab olites, released from sites of tissue injury, platelets are activated and undergo robust rheologic transformation ( Fig 1 ) .

Endothelial-bound platelets can induce \"secondary capture\" of neutrophils by fi rst facilitating platelet-neutrophil interactions and then by directing subsequent neutrophil-endothelial cell contact. Neutrophils also are capable of rolling along a template of adherent platelets-an event regulated by numerous adhesive receptors and promoted by shear forces and alterations in cellular structure. 17 This rolling phenomenon is thought to be mediated largely by P-selectin, which directs leukocyte adherence and then supports leukocyte transmigration directly to the site of injury. 18 ",

Once activated, platelets release numerous secretory products and have been shown to express a multitude of receptors involved in the infl ammatory response ( Table 1 ). In atherosclerosis, for instance, activated platelets can release adhesive ligands such as P-selectin. P-selectin is capable of creating a phospholipid-rich platform that then facilitates the recruitment of mononuclear cells and lymphocytes to the atherosclerotic plaque. 7 Platelet activation has been associated with enhanced cytokine expression in other infl ammatory conditions, including acute coronary syndromes, coronary stent restenosis, and solid organ transplant rejection. 12, 13 Platelets also interact directly with other infl ammatory cells, helping to engineer both physiologic and pathologic immune events. Leukocytes, for instance, are known to play an important role in host defense when recruited to sites of infl ammation. 14 Although critical in helping to defend the host from invading Gawaz and colleagues 29 found that plasma from patients with sepsis increased both the adhesion and the aggregability of normal platelets to cultured endothelium. Mavrommatis et al 22 later showed that platelet activation was significantly increased in patients with sepsis compared with healthy control subjects. Others have demonstrated that sepsis results in increased P-selectin expression. 30 On the other hand, platelet function by aggregometry and fl ow cytometry was shown to be decreased in studies by Yaguchi et al, 31 and Boldt et al 32 demonstrated that aggregation decreased over time in a cohort of trauma patients who later developed sepsis.",

In a ventilator stressinduced model of ARDS, Yiming et al 47 demonstrated increased expression of vWF, glycoprotein Ib, and P-selectin on the endothelial surfaces of rat and mice lungs. In a bronchoscopic study of patients with lung injury, Idell and colleagues 48 found that levels of platelet-specifi c a -granule proteins were elevated in BAL fl uid from injured tissue and directly correlated with the degree of pulmonary injury. In a study of critically ill patients, investigators not only found that in vivo platelet activation was more robust among those with acute respiratory failure but also showed that marked platelet dysfunction, characterized by impaired aggregation and prolonged bleeding time, was a typical feature in these individuals. 49 A careful review of several currently used evidencebased therapies for ALI and ARDS provides additional insight into the potential pathologic role of platelet-mediated events. A host of clinical studies have helped to defi ne contemporary treatment strategies for this critical illness, and several of these therapies share, in part, an ability to modify mechanisms of platelet activation and aggregation. Perhaps the most well-validated strategy to reduce mortality is the use of low-tidal-volume ventilation, 2 and, in fact, the use of injurious high-tidal-volume ventilation has been shown to upregulate both vWF and P-selectin expression. 47 Using lung-protective positive pressure ventilation, however, is associated with decreased ADP-and collagen-mediated platelet aggregation. 50 Nitric oxide, another therapy often used in ARDS/ALI despite limited data to support its routine use, has been shown to decrease platelet aggregation by reduc ing fi brinogen binding to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor. 51 As well, the controversial use of corticosteroids in ARDS 52 has been associated with decreased platelet activation and activity in some experimental models. 53, 54 Although not suggesting that these therapies improved lung injury through their platelet-modifying effects alone, these data do support a biologic plausibility that should be considered when studying the impact of dysregulated platelet activity on patient outcomes ( Fig 2 ) .",

Other investigators have demonstrated that inhibition of platelet-associated neutrophil recruitment can mitigate all forms of end-organ damage, helping to establish a causal relationship between plateletneutrophil interactions and the pathologic injury seen in severe sepsis. 40, 41 It has been proposed that platelets recruit neutrophils to sites of tissue injury and infl ammation, resulting in subsequent damage through a variety of mechanisms. Platelet-neutrophil aggregates may become trapped within narrow sites of organ microvasculature, leading to regional ischemia. Kirschenbaum and colleagues, 42 for instance, showed that formation of these aggregates had a pronounced effect on altering blood rheology in patients with sepsis, a process that the investigators believed contributed significantly to impairments in perfusion. Platelets also may adhere directly to infl amed endothelial cells and promote secondary capture of toxic circulating leukocytes. This mechanism has been supported by several small studies in which targeted inhibition of platelet-specifi c ligands on neutrophils reliably attenuated sepsis-associated endothelial injury. 29, 43 Circulating platelet-neutrophil complexes and plateletstimulated neutrophil extracellular trap formation also can be seen in the patient with sepsis. These neutrophil extracellular traps are believed to represent a subset of activated neutrophils with enhanced ability to adhere, phagocytose, and produce injurious superoxide. 43 Finally, other data suggest that lymphotoxicity and lymphoid cell apoptosis may result from sepsis-induced alterations in platelet mRNA profi les. 44 ",

In patients with chronic, stable angina, for instance, aspirin signifi cantly lowered CRP and infl ammatory cytokine levels. 59 Conversely, in other patients with chronic ischemic heart disease, recent myocardial infarction, and acute coronary syndromes, aspirin failed to reliably reduce CRP. 60, 61 In peripheral arterial disease as well, markers of platelet-mediated infl ammation were not signifi cantly decreased with aspirin therapy. 62 There is also confl icting evidence regarding the potential of aspirin to mitigate pathologic infl ammatory interactions between platelets and leukocytes. 62, 63 Clopidogrel: Clopidogrel (Plavix), an irreversible antagonist of the G-protein-coupled platelet ADP receptor (P2Y12), has been shown to have a greater infl uence on cardiovascular risk reduction among patients at heightened inflammatory states.

In early studies of antiplatelet drugs in endotoxemic pigs, pretreatment was found to have minimal effects on the pathogenesis of Escherichia coli -induced shock. Despite platelet targeting, clinical sepsis ensued in these animals, with concomitant decreases in levels of platelets along with activation of both the coagulation and fi brinolytic systems. 79 Clopidogrel also had no demonstrable effect on hemostatic or infl ammatory responses of pigs infused with E coli endotoxin. 80 However, when specifi cally using clopidogrel in other animal models of sepsis, several investigators have reported that not only is platelet activation reduced but also clinical thrombocytopenia is attenuated, clot formation is decreased, cytokine upregulation is mitigated, and neutrophil recruitment may be minimized. 68, 81 Antiplatelet Agents in ALI and ARDS Even fewer data exist regarding antiplatelet strategies in critically ill patients with lung injury. Targeted platelet depletion or disruption of plateletneutrophil interactions in murine models of ARDS resulted in reduced neutrophil migration and permeability, improved alveolar gas exchange, and increased survival. 41 Aspirin use in an experimental 12 months for those patients in the highest tertile of high-sensitivity CRP levels. 64 Likewise, shorter-term cardiovascular events were reduced following PCI in those patients pretreated with clopidogrel who had elevated baseline CRP values. 65 Unlike aspirin therapy, however, clopidogrel administration has been shown to reduce the secretion of adhesive ligands and to block the formation of plateletleukocyte conjugates, with resulting decreases in leukocyte activity. In patients treated with PCI, clopidogrel reduced ADP-and thrombin receptor-activating peptide-induced expression of the platelet P-selectin. 66 Evangelista and colleagues 67 showed that clopidogrel use had a potent inhibitory effect on platelet-dependent production of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils, as well as monocyte expression of tissue factor. Klinkhardt et al 68 found that more-prolonged clopidogrel pretreatment could signifi cantly reduce the volume of both platelet-monocyte and plateletneutrophil aggregates following ADP stimulation, effects that correlated directly with substantial reductions in P-selectin expression. Similarly, clopidogrel therapy has been shown to reduce platelet-neutrophil and platelet-monocyte conjugates in patients across a spectrum of vascular diseases. 62, 69 Other Antiplatelet Agents: Confl icting data have come from studies of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists in infl ammatory conditions. Modest levels of receptor blockade actually have been associated with increases in platelet-mediated proinfl ammatory effects, along with enhanced expression of P-selectin, 70 and increased release of soluble CD40 ligand. 71 Furthermore, although the synthetic small-molecule GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor eptifi batide (Integrilin) signifi cantly reduced levels of CRP at 24 h compared with placebo in the Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet IIb/IIIa Receptor with Integrilin Therapy trial, levels subsequently increased beyond baseline 30 h following infusion. 72 On the other hand, abciximab (ReoPro), a chimeric Fab fragment of a monoclonal antibody with high affi nity for the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, was found to suppress the usual rise in levels of circulating infl ammatory markers following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. 73 Finally, among small populations of patients treated with tirofi ban (Aggrastat), data have been largely inconclusive. 74, 75 ",

No longer are these anucleate cells considered merely executors of the thrombotic process but, instead, are clearly key contributors to the host immune response. Although initially adaptive, unregulated platelet activation during sepsis, ALI, and ARDS leads to organ hypoperfusion, pathologic tissue injury, and poor patient outcomes. Whether modulation of this platelet response will improve the high morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases remains to be seen. Small, nonrandomized clinical studies of antiplatelet strategies have yielded mixed results but should prompt additional investigation.",

Building on circumstantial evidence from trials of contemporary antiplatelet therapies, some investigators have begun to focus greater attention on the role of adenosine and its myriad of receptors on the pathobiology of infl ammation. During conditions of high metabolic stress, as seen in acute tissue injury and sepsis for instance, extracellular adenosine concentrations often are markedly increased. 83 Adenosine is believed to play an important role in preventing neutrophil infi ltration into vulnerable tissue, 84 and a growing body of data suggests a possible role for adenosine in modulating adaptive immune response to critical illness.",
