International travelers may have been in direct or indirect contact with previously isolated, remote populations and ecosystems. The challenge is that travelers returning home may harbor exotic infections that are still in the incubation stage. During the acute stage of illness, nonspecific flu-like clinical signs and symptoms may not suggest the correct diagnosis to local healthcare providers. Thus, infections acquired during travel may be transmitted to others in the community by returned travelers before the diagnosis can be made. In addition to international travelers, imported animals, birds, foods, and insects from abroad, especially from tropical developing countries, can also pose a significant threat to the public health of receiving countries by serving as means of transportation for pathogens into new geographic areas.",

The alphavirus is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected daytime-biting Aedes mosquitos, mainly Aedes aegypti and, since more recently, Ae. albopictus. The disease has been reported among travelers returning from endemic areas as a cause of acute illness characterized by sudden onset of fever, chills, severe joint pain with or without swelling, lower back pain, and a maculopapular rash, similar to the symptoms of dengue fever. In some CHIKV patients, residual joint pain and impairment persists for months and even years after the acute illness, leading to considerable morbidity. As reviewed by Weaver et al. (2015) a large outbreak of chikungunya emerged in 2004 in coastal Kenya; in 2005 it spread to the Indian Ocean islands and subsequently to India and many countries in Southeast Asia, causing several million cases. In 2007 cases of chikungunya were first reported from Europe: infected air travelers imported the disease into France and Italy, which led to local autochthonous transmission. It turned out that the virus had adapted to a new vector, Aedes albopictus, facilitating viral spread to an even wider geographic region. Further factors contributing to the magnitude of the outbreak were an increase in air travel to and from affected areas, previous lack of exposure to the virus of the newly involved populations, and spread of Ae. albopictus from its native Asia to islands of the Indian Ocean basin and to Southern Europe. In 2013 a further large outbreak originated on the Caribbean island of St. Martin. It rapidly spread through the Caribbean, to the United States, to Latin America, and to French Polynesia, causing several million cases. This was the first time a chikungunya outbreak had officially been recorded in the Western hemisphere.",

Even though it usually causes a mild illness, the development of subsequent Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome has been reported in a number of cases. Zika was known to be endemic in Africa and Southeast Asia. In 2007, an outbreak of Zika virus infection occured on Yap island (Micronesia). These were the first recognized cases outside Africa and Asia. The emergence of ZIKV on the isolated island community showed the potential of the virus to spread through commerce and travel across long distances. An even larger outbreak occurred in 2013-2014 in French Polynesia, causing an estimated 32,000 cases and spreading within the region. In the context of this outbreak, cases related to international travel were reported by Zammarchi et al. (2015) in two Japanese, one Norwegian, and two Italian travelers. A number of further travel-related cases of Zika virus were reported. Interestingly, one scientist returning to the United States from Cameroon with ZIKV later infected his wife, probably by sexual transmission, as discussed by Foy et al. (2011) . In 2015, Zika was first detected in Brazil, leading to autochthonous transmission of the virus.",

Nevertheless, the number of malaria cases recorded in international travelers is decreasing. Emerging, however, is the number of cases of Plasmodium knowlesi malaria seen in travelers. P. knowlesi was first described in the 1920s as a simian malaria parasite, and it was not known to infect humans until the 1960s when it was found in malaria patients in Malaysia. This led to its recognition as the fifth human malaria parasite. In 2006 it first appeared in the context of travel medicine when a Swedish traveler returning from Malaysia was diagnosed with P. knowlesi infection. Muller et al. (2014) in their review highlight several reports of imported P. knowlesi cases in travelers from all over the world. P. knowlesi is not geographically restricted to Malaysia but was also found in Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, and the Philippines and may well occur in jungle or forest areas in other countries of the region. On microscopy P. knowlesi closely resembles Plasmodium malariae. It is therefore not completely clear if the parasite is truly emerging or has rather been misclassified in the past. Travel in or near forested areas is considered a risk factor. Cases are mostly mild, but severe and fatal cases have been reported (Chapter 20).",

Causal factors include increasing populations of humans as well as animal reservoirs (white-footed mice, white-tailed deer, Ixodes ticks) and mutual encroachment on traditional habitats. These have resulted in expanded opportunities for tick-borne transmission of Lyme borreliosis in suburban areas close to human dwellings as well as in the recognized transmission risk areas of grasslands and shrubs at the edge of forests (Chapter 24).",

Disease transmission of air-borne pathogens may occur whenever a susceptible person is in close proximity to an infectious person, and wherever large groups of people are crowded together. Additionally, direct inoculation from contaminated fingers to mucosal surfaces of the mouth, nose, and eyes is probably as significant as droplet inhalation in transmission of respiratory viruses. Personal hygiene measures including frequent hand cleansing and respiratory etiquette can help prevent the spread of infections. Continued public health guidance and a legislative framework for implementation of mandatory screening, isolation, and quarantine of travelers meeting infectious case definitions are necessary to prevent transmission and prevent outbreaks.",

The travelers who presented with fever and severe myalgias were found to have marked eosinophilia and raised creatine kinase levels. The muscle biopsy from six of the patients was histologically diagnostic for acute muscular sarcocystosis, and DNA of the snake-associated parasite Sarcocystis nesbitii could be isolated in one case.
