Similarly, organ transplantation (and donation) is viewed as a matter of individual choice. 5 Predonation of blood for the purposes of later autotransfusion (pre-deposit) is unacceptable, 7 although many Jehovah's Witnesses will accept peri-and postoperative autologous procedures based on a personal decision, especially when the removal and transfusion of blood can be managed via a continuous circuit such as heart bypass, acute normovolaemic haemodilution, dialysis or cell salvage machines. 8, 9 In recent years, some Witness patients have accepted the use of haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers without offending either conscience or community, 10 although many Jehovah's Witnesses may refuse such novel medications. Therefore, each patient's individual needs, values and beliefs must be assessed, acknowledged and respected. Specific treatments should be carefully discussed with the patient and family in order to clarify exactly what is acceptable. This may require a multidisciplinary approach, with medical and nursing staff as well as local representatives from the Jehovah's Witness hospital liaison committee, who can be of great assistance.",

In elective surgery this should rarely be an issue, providing decisions have been made clearly in advance (Table 1) . However, a difficult situation would be the management of an unconscious Jehovah's Witness patient with severe haemorrhage. In these circumstances, the doctor should search for clear evidence, such as an Advance Directive, stating that the patient would not accept blood products, even with lifethreatening bleeding. In the absence of such evidence, the doctor should act in what he or she sees as the best interests of the patient with or without the use of blood. 8 For children of Jehovah's Witnesses, legal precedent supports life-saving transfusion against parents' wishes, but two doctors of consultant status should clearly document the reasons for transfusion. 8 In less urgent cases, the matter may be referred to the courts. 9",

These principles have gained popularity of late, and many centres of bloodless surgery exist in North America. This approach has gained credence, as the deleterious effects of blood transfusion become more apparent. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 13 West Nile virus 14 and prion-related diseases 15 are the latest to join human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, C and others on the list of potentially transmissible diseases. Furthermore, in an attempt to reduce the risk of transmitting infection, the donor pool for blood products has been curtailed. 16 The principles of bloodless surgery are summarised in Table 2 .",

Many surgeons advocate the use of cell salvage in cases of malignancy and infection as the risks are thought to be low. 25, 26 However, further research is needed to clarify the role of cell salvage in these patients.
