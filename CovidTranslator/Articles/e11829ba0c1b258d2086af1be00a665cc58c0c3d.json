Recent clinical trials exploring the efficacy of ex vivo modified autologous DC-based vaccines have reported some promising results. However, in vitro generation of autologous DC for clinical administration, their loading with tumor associated antigens (TAA) and their activation, is laborious and expensive, and, due to interindividual variability in the personalized vaccines, poorly standardized. An attractive alternative approach is to load resident DC in vivo by targeted delivery of TAA , using viral vectors and activating them simultaneously. To this end we have constructed genetically modified Adenoviral (Ad) vectors and bispecific adaptor molecules to retarget Ad vectors encoding TAA to the CD40 receptor on DC. Preclinical human and murine studies conducted so far have clearly demonstrated the suitability of a \"two-component\", i.e. Ad and adaptor molecule, configuration for targeted modification of DC in vivo for cancer immunotherapy. This review summarizes recent progress in the development of CD40-targeted Ad-based cancer vaccines and highlights pre-clinical issues in clinical translation of this approach.",

            "text": "Ex vivo modified DC-based vaccines have been used in the clinic for the immunotherapy of cancer, so far with only limited success [reviewed in 1] . Production of these DC vaccines usually entails differentiating DC from individual patients' progenitor cells and their subsequent loading with Tumor-Associated Antigens (TAA), followed by appropriate maturation induction and their injection back into the patients in the hope of inducing an effective anti-tumor immune response [2] . Limited clinical efficacy observed so far may be due to sub-optimal ex vivo DC activation/maturation (required for effective T-effector cell priming and differentiation) and limited migration of the administered DC; typically less than 2% of the injected DC number reach the vaccination site-draining lymph nodes (LN) where T cell activation should occur [1, 2] . Even though further optimization may be expected to enhance the efficacy of these DC vaccines, this approach remains laborious and expensive. Moreover, inter-individual variability in the quality of the vaccines is inherent to such an autologous cell-based approach and complicates interpretation of the clinical data. An attractive alternative approach is to load the resident DC in vivo by targeted delivery of TAA and activating them simultaneously, thereby avoiding the cumbersome isolation and culture of DC precursor cells. This also serves to exploit the natural homing ability to LN of activated DC in situ for effective antigen specific T cell activation.",

In addition to that, viral vectors also are very effective, as they mimic a natural infection and trigger the right kind of innate immune response, which is a precondition for the development of an effective Th1 response to the vaccineencoded antigen [7, 8] . Some viruses even exhibit a natural tropism for DC, making them pre-eminently suitable vaccine carriers for DC-targeted vaccination [9] . Finally, viral transduction results in durable endogenous antigen expression which facilitates MHC class I presentation after proteasome-mediated degradation and also continuous presentation of antigen to specific CTL over prolonged periods of time, hence making attenuated, nonreplicating viruses attractive vaccine carriers for cancer immunotherapy [10, 11] . In contrast, non-viral systems often need to be specifically designed and optimized to achieve the above listed advantageous natural traits of viral vectors [10] .",

They are non-enveloped viruses that can be stably packaged as lyophilized preparations in vials or capsules. Ad DNA does not integrate into host chromosomal DNA; Ad-mediated transduction thus poses minimal risk for insertional mutagenesis [15] . Ad vectors are easily grown to high titers, exhibit low cytotoxicity, large cloning capacity and are efficient in gene transfer even to non-dividing target cells. The latter in particular is relevant to DC targeting, as DC residing in peripheral tissues have reached end-stage differentiation and have lost their proliferative capacity. The most commonly used vectors are derived from Ad type-5 (Ad5) and have shown their potential to stimulate a potent humoral and cellular immune response to transgene encoded antigens [16, 17] . While notable toxicities and reduced efficacy have been associated with pre-existing immunity to the most common Ad vectors infecting humans [reviewed in 18], Ad vector-based vaccines and therapeutics are still considered to be among the safest and most effective -leading to their continued application in developing improved treatments for a diverse array of diseases [19] [20] [21] [22] . An exceptional ability of Ad vectors to generate cellular immunity against recombinant antigens in humans [23] makes them preferred antigen carriers for cancer vaccination.",

            "text": "The Ad5 fiber knob domain mediates binding to the Coxsackie-Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) on the target cell surface of Ad5-susceptible cells (see Fig. 1 ). Subsequent interaction of the Ad penton base (i.e. where the protruding fibers connect to the viral capsid) with integrins on the cell surface facilitates internalization of the virion. However, DC are resistant to Ad5 infection due to their lack of expression of the primary Ad5 docking receptor CAR, presenting a challenge for effective transduction of DC by Ad [26] . Direct in vivo administration of untargeted Ad5 may thus result in cytopathic effects due to ectopic gene transfer to CAR expressing bystander cells rather than DC. Moreover, subsequent antigen presentation by these transduced non-professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) may lead to suboptimal T cell activation, or even tolerance induction [27] . Systemic utility of Ad5 vectors is also limited as a result of the high prevalence (in 50-90% of the population) of pre-existing immunity towards the vector [28] . This pre-existent immunity may also limit the vaccination efficacy of Ad5 vectors in prime-boost protocols. To avoid these side effects and to improve therapeutic efficacy, the natural tropism of the vector can be ablated and altered to improve selective tropism to DC. In general either a \"two-component\" or a \"single-component\" approach has been used to achieve these goals ( Fig. 2) [29] . In the twocomponent approach, a bispecific adaptor molecule is complexed with the Ad vector to simultaneously block native receptor binding and retarget Ad vectors to receptors expressed on the target cell of interest. In the \"single-component\" approach the Ad vector is genetically modified to ablate native receptor binding and to re-target the vector to a cell receptor of interest. The main advantage of the two-component approach is its great flexibility, since vectors carrying different genes of interest can be easily coupled to these adaptors. On the other hand, single-component systems offer advantages for standardized manufacturing, providing greater potential for commercial distribution of a therapeutic vector [29] . We have explored both approaches in the retargeting of Ad5 vectors to the CD40 surface receptor on skin DC in an endeavor to translate an intradermal (i.d.) DCtargeted vaccination approach to the clinic (Fig. 2 ).",

            "text": "CD40 is a cell surface receptor that belongs to the Tumor Necrosis Factor-Receptor (TNF-R) family. It was first identified and functionally characterized on B lymphocytes [30, 31] . Later reports revealed that the expression of CD40 was not restricted to B cells but that it was also expressed on monocytes, DC and on non-hematopoietic cells including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, neurons, endothelial, epithelial, and tumor cells [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . CD40 receptor on DC plays a crucial role in maturation of these cells into fully competent antigen presenting cells and the generation of long-term CD8 + effector T cell mediated immunity [39] . The interaction of CD40 receptor on B cells with CD40L, is critical for the induction of a humoral immune response by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin producing plasma cells [40] . On non-hematopoietic cells, such as endothelial cells, CD40 is involved in the amplification and regulation of inflammatory responses. During a normal T cell response, CD40 on DC is engaged by CD40L, which is transiently expressed on activated Th cells [41] . CD40-CD40L interaction is important for activation of DC both under normal as well as under regulatory T cell (Treg) induced suppressive conditions [42] . The importance of DC activation via CD40 ligation has been demonstrated in a number of studies, where DC targeted antibody-antigen fusion products induced tolerance to the antigen unless an agonistic anti-CD40 mAb was coadministered [43] [44] [45] . Hence, agonistic mAb against CD40 or recombinant trimerized CD40L is administered in combination with the antigen to induce memory and protective CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses [31, 46, 47] . We and others have pursued the strategy to combine antigen delivery to DC and their simultaneous activation through CD40 [41, 48, 49] . Although CD40 expression is not restricted to DC, its DC activation properties nevertheless make it a very attractive targeting motif. Moreover, the route of administration may determine whether relative over-expression of CD40 on DC provides enough of a window to achieve their selective targeting. Our data in human skin [50] and in human skin-draining LN [51] certainly indicate this to be the case for the i.d. route of administration, clearly demonstrating that any binding that might occur to other cells (e.g. endothelial cells in the dermis or B cells in the LN) does not interfere with efficient vaccine delivery to DC and subsequent CTL activation. Of note, expression of other DC targeting motifs, pursued for vaccination purposes, is often also not restricted to DC. A case in point is DC-SIGN, with confirmed expression on macrophages in human LN, despite its often perceived and expounded specificity for DC [52] . Also, many of these alternative targets (including DC-SIGN) lack the added advantage of mediating DC activation. Therefore, we, and others, have designed and tested vaccine constructs that agonistically bind to CD40 for targeted delivery of antigens to DC and simultaneous maturation induction.",

The first construct consisted of a recombinant mAb with V regions specific for CD40 and its C region containing a defined T cell epitope. The other was a homodimer, each chain of which was composed of a single-chain variable region fragment (scFv) targeting CD40, a dimerization motif, and an antigenic unit. Both constructs bound CD40, induced maturation of DC, and enhanced primary and memory T cell responses. Intramuscular delivery of these vaccine constructs, in the form of naked DNA, induced T cell responses specific for the MHC class II-restricted epitopes, antibody responses, and protected mice from myeloma and lymphoma growth. The observed effects were attributed to both targeted delivery of antigen to APC for presentation on MHC class II molecules and simultaneous activation of the targeted APC. Since CD8 + CTL have the ability to specifically recognize and kill tumor cells, recent efforts in the development of anti-cancer vaccines have mainly focused on enhancing induction of tumor-specific CD8 + T lymphocyte responses [53] . We have achieved this through CD40-mediated delivery of Ad5 vectors to DC in situ. Over the past decade we have explored different CD40-targeted Ad5 (CD40-Ad) configurations for their efficacy in terms of (in situ) DC targeting and transduction of subsequent T cell activation and tumor protection (Fig. 2 ). In the next paragraphs the different CD40-Ad configurations will be described and pre-clinical evidence of their efficacy discussed, highlighting their pros and cons for clinical translation. Together, these observations illustrate the pre-clinical triumphs and failures that line the long and winding road to clinical translation.",

Retargeting of Ad5 to CD40 using this bispecific antibody construct dramatically enhanced gene transfer to monocyte derived DC (MoDC) and also induced both their phenotypic and functional maturation [48] . In this first study functional activation was evidenced by increased T cell stimulation in an allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) and by enhanced IL-12p70 release. When using a chemical Ab conjugate that incorporates the murine CD40 (mCD40) targeting mAb FGK45, we found that this particular targeting approach also significantly enhanced gene transfer and induced phenotypic maturation of murine Bone Marrow-derived DC (BMDC) [54] . Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of BMDC that were transduced with a CD40-targeted Ad5 vector encoding the viral E7 oncogene derived from Human Papillomavirus (HPV) type-16 resulted in superior protection against the outgrowth of HPV-16-transformed tumor cells in vivo [54] .

CD40 targeting of Ad5 vectors enhanced selective transduction of human CD1a + DC located in the dermis of cultured skin explants and also increased and stabilized their maturation status upon migration. Indeed, we observed that, following CD40-mediated i.d. delivery in skin explant tissue, the absolute number of eGFP+ transduced DC present in migratory populations was significantly increased (Fig. 3B) .

Moreover, it was also believed to facilitate safety assessment in a single Phase-I clinical trial.

            "text": "Early efforts to genetically retarget Ad vectors mostly focused on alteration of the tropism of the virus through incorporation of target receptor-specific ligands into either the carboxy terminus or HI loop of the fiber. These sites tolerated the insertion of only small linear ligand sequences without substantially affecting the infectivity and propagation of the resulting retargeted vector [57] . Insertion of complex, folded, and consequently more selective ligands, appeared to disturb trimerization of the Ad fiber and prevent subsequent incorporation of fiber into the adenovirus capsid [58] . To overcome this limitation, a fiber replacement strategy for the generation of tropism-modified Ad5 was considered. In this strategy, the fiber knob domain, alone or together with the shaft domain, was replaced with a combination of two heterologous domains, one of which functioned as a receptor-binding ligand and the other of which supported the functional structure of the entire protein chimera. We showed the feasibility of this approach by replacing the Ad5 fiber protein with a protein chimera comprising an N-terminal portion of the Ad5 fiber, genetically fused with the phage T4 Fibritin which contained a trimerization motif and thus facilitated the naturally trimerized structure of the Ad5 fiber (Fig. 4) [59] . Targeting of the resultant rAd5 vector to an artificial receptor was achieved by incorporation of C-terminal peptide ligands into the protein chimera. Subsequently, we used the same strategy to create rAd5 vectors retargeted to human CD40 by incorporating the functional TNF-like domain of hCD40L into a chimeric Ad fiber consisting of the Ad5 fiber capsid-anchoring N-terminus and trimerized phage T4 fibritin (Fig. 4C ) [60] . Despite the considerable size of the CD40L domain and its complex tertiary structure, both components of the targeting protein, the CD40L domain and the FF backbone, folded properly, thereby making the entire chimera fully functional. The incorporation of the chimeric fiber into the Ad virion did not affect the functional structure of its CD40-binding component, resulting in a vector (Ad5.FFCD40L) that used CD40 as a surrogate receptor for cell entry. However, in comparing the CD40-targeted Ad with untargeted Ad containing wild-type (wt) fibers, the CD40-targeted Ad showed significantly reduced transduction efficiency of target cells expressing both CAR and CD40 at high levels [60] . Experiments with radiolabeled CD40-targeted Ad and untargeted Ad nevertheless revealed that both viruses were equally efficient in binding to target cells. This result led us to hypothesize that complete deletion of the fiber in CD40-targeted Ad affected its ability to infect target cells by interfering with a downstream process from primary binding to the cell surface. The construction of a mosaic version of CD40-targeted Ad which, in addition to phage T4 fibritin, and the human CD40L chimeric fiber, also contained a full size wt Ad5 fiber engineered to lack CAR-binding ability (by deletion of the CAR-binding TAYT sequence), enhanced its ability to infect target cells and facilitated large scale production of a stably CD40-retargeted rAd5 vector (i.e. Ad5.FFCD40L[F5dTAYT]) [60] . Subsequent comparison of the CD40-targeted mosaic Ad with untargeted Ad5 showed the superior transduction efficacy of the mosaic vector on human MoDC in vitro [60] . To determine the potential of the Ad5.FFCD40L[F5dTAYT] vectors to effect in situ targeted antigen expression in DC, we constructed a CD40-targeted mosaic Ad encoding both GFP and the Carcino-Embryonic Antigen (CEA) [49] . The application of this vector in the stringent human skin explant model demonstrated its utility for in vivo selective transduction of DC and induction of their activation and migration [49] .",

We constructed an expression plasmid encoding a fusion protein of the Ad tail and \u03c31 T(ii) domains, linked to human CD40L. Upon expression, this chimeric attachment protein efficiently trimerized and retained the capacity to specifically bind CD40; moreover, reconstitution of fully functional infectious viral particles was observed upon transfection of this CD40-retargeted fiber in 293 containing the doubly ablated Ad5 genome (i.e. with deletion of both the CAR-and integrinbinding sequences) [our own unpublished data]. Nevertheless, this \u03c31-based approach would still require the cGMP development of a CD40-expressing cell line for clinical-grade propagation and large-scale production of the CD40-retargeted Ad vector. As this was deemed cost-inhibitive to such an extent that it would have precluded clinical translation within the foreseeable future, this approach was abandoned. In fact, a different attitude was gaining the upper hand in the field of translational cancer studies, favoring the accelerated clinical testing of combinations of therapies, and thus generating a renewed interest in the two-component approach to CD40-targeted Ad vaccination.",

Based on this understanding, we developed a novel CAR-containing adaptor molecule that assumes a trimeric conformation via trimerization motifs derived from a 71-amino acid fragment of the bacteriophage T4 fibritin protein [62] . The trimeric structure of CAR resulted in efficient binding to and neutralization of the rAd5 fiber knob. In order to facilitate efficient transduction and activation of murine DC, we designed and produced a recombinant fusion protein CFmCD40L, that contained the ectodomain of CAR genetically linked via a trimerization motif to the extracellular domain of mouse CD40L [63] . Incorporation of the trimerization motif served two purposes, 1) it increased the Ad fiber knob binding avidity [62] and 2) it promoted and stabilized a native trimeric conformation of CD40L, which is necessary for efficient CD40 binding and function [31] . The CFmCD40L adaptor was produced in mammalian cells to benefit from posttranslational glycosylation. The produced adaptor demonstrated strong affinity for both Ad5 fiber knob and mouse (and human) CD40 and its use to retarget Ad5 enhanced transduction and activation of both murine and human DC [51, 63] . This compatibility with both mCD40 and hCD40 is explained by the high homology of the incorporated murine TNF-like CD40L domain with its human counterpart [64] . Subcutaneous injection of this CD40-Ad configuration, encoding the \u03b2-gal model antigen, induced superior antigenspecific Th and CTL responses in Balb/c mice [63] and i.d. injection of CD40-Ad encoding SARS-CoV NP resulted in a more Th1-skewed antigen-specific immune response in a Balb/ c infectious mouse model [65] . Similarly, stronger T cell and IgG2 antibody responses (indicative of Th1 skewing) were recently observed against the human tumor antigen CEA upon i.d. delivery of a CD40-targeted Ad5 vaccine, incorporating the same FCD40L domain, in a canine model [66] .",

Their size (approx. 80 nm) predicts that upon i.d. delivery Ad5 vaccines will not only target dermally located DC, but will also rapidly drain through lymphatics to LN, there to target LN-resident DC subsets. It is therefore important to note that our recent studies have demonstrated the enhanced ex vivo transduction of conventional and plasmacytoid DC subsets by CD40targeted Ad (by use of the CFmCD40L adaptor) in suspensions of human melanomadraining sentinel LN (SLN, see Fig. 3C ) [51] . Moreover, CD40 targeting of Ad5 encoding the melanoma TAA MART-1, enhanced the expansion of functional MART-1-specific CD8+ T cells from these SLN (Fig. 3D ) with concomitant decreases in both CD4:CD8 T cell ratios and proliferation rates of immunosuppressive CD4 + CD25 hi FoxP3 + Tregs. Additional in vitro studies revealed that CD40-mediated transduction and activation of MoDC with CD40-Ad5-MART-1 significantly enhanced their priming efficiency of fully functional CD8 + effector CTL that responded to the HLA-A2-restricted MART-1 26-35L epitope with high avidity. Importantly, these CD40-Ad primed CTL were of significantly higher avidity than CTL primed by MART-1 26-35L peptide-loaded MoDC and efficiently lysed HLA-A2 + MART-1 + melanoma cells. In addition, we recently obtained evidence that i.d. delivery of a CD40-targeted Ad vector encoding the full length melanoma antigen gp100, can efficiently induce antigen specific CTL in mice and significantly retard the subcutaneous growth of highly aggressive and poorly immunogenic B16F10 murine melanomas in a therapeutic setting [67] .",

We now aim to translate this approach to the clinic. The envisioned approach is to recruit activated Langerhans cells (LC) and dermal DC in the skin and selectively transduce these (and possibly DC residing in the vaccination site-draining LN) [67] in situ with CD40 targeted Ad vector encoding full length TAA. This would result in a clinically applicable and highly flexible two-component DC-targeted Ad vector configuration, allowing vaccination with different TAA encoding Ad vectors simultaneously, depending on antigen expression profiles of the primary or metastatic tumors.",

In the case of CD40-targeted Ad vaccine development we utilized the following model systems: 1) in vitro human and murine DC culture models, 2) a human full-thickness skin explant model, 3) a human ex vivo melanoma-draining LN model, 4) in vivo murine melanoma and infectious models and 5) an in vivo canine immunization model.

Furthermore, increased appreciation for species-specific differences in DC subset activities, such as poor cross-priming activity by murine LC, in contrast to superior cross-priming and induction of CD8 + T cells by human LC, supports studies utilizing the human skin explant model [68, 69] . Selective and efficient in situ LC and dermal DC transduction by CD40-targeted Ad was demonstrated in this organotypic model in the presence of all epidermal and dermal cellular and matrix components -as would be the case upon in vivo dermal delivery. Moreover, this model provided vital proof of increased DC maturation induction, functional DC migration and transgenic antigen-specific CD8 + T cell stimulation by migrated DC upon i.d. injection of CD40-targeted Ad (Fig 3A,B) [50] . All these events are vital steps towards efficient antitumor T cell priming and, ultimately, clinical efficacy. Similarly, ex vivo suspensions of melanoma SLN were utilized to demonstrate selective DC transduction in LN, as well as DC maturation and enhanced activation and expansion of TAA-specific T cells residing in the SLN (Fig 3C,D) [51] . Together these two human ex vivo models represent the two vital in vivo compartments where immunological priming is instigated upon i.d. delivery of a vaccine: the skin with its DC and dense lymphatic network and the draining LN where the migrated DC encounter naive T cells and where specific T cell priming and expansion takes place. We feel that these human organotypic/ex vivo models are vital to predict how the targeted virus will behave in tissue microenvironments in a clinical setting. This is important since oft-used mouse models differ considerably from human skin in anatomy, cutaneous lymphatic drainage patterns and DC subset definitions [70] . For instance, in contrast to human skin [50, 71] , we failed to demonstrate the recruitment of LC and dermal DC to the dermal vaccination site in murine skin by pre-treatment with either cytokines (e.g. GM-CSF) or immunostimulatory TLR-L (e.g. CpG and LPS) (Hangalapura et al., unpublished data). This recruitment in human skin provided a \"reservoir\" of migratory LC/DC that could be efficiently targeted by intradermally delivered CD40-targeted Ad [50] , but in the much thinner murine dermis we could not reproduce this observation, neither ex vivo nor in vivo.",

Interestingly, i.d. injection of untargeted Ad5 resulted in higher total transgene expression levels in the LN (a clear sign of successful ablation of the natural Ad5 tropism upon CD40retargeting), which was mostly attributable to transduction of macrophage-like cells in the marginal sinuses (Fig. 5A,B) . In contrast, CD40-targeted Ad5 preferentially transduced CD11c + DC in the paracortical areas (Fig.5C,D) . Obviously, this anatomical information could not have been obtained from the transduction experiments on human ex vivo SLNderived single-cell suspensions Murine in vivo data also revealed efficient induction of TAA-specific CTL and prophylactic and therapeutic anti-tumor efficacy of CD40-targeted Ad [72] . Anatomically, canine skin and its lymphatics more closely resemble human skin and dogs may therefore provide a more relevant transitional animal model for pre-clinical validation of i.d. administered DC-targeted Ad vaccines. Similarly to humans, canines rapidly recruit DC and myeloid cells to the dermis, locally, at a site of i.d. injection of GM-CSF [66 and Timares et al., unpublished data] . We recently showed the utility of a canine model for immunological efficacy assessment of an i.d. injected CD40-targeted Ad vaccine encoding the TAA CEA [66] . CD40 targeting of the Ad5-based vaccine resulted in enhanced proliferative and serological responses against CEA and in addition pointed to induction of a type-1 skewed immune response. As canine tumors in histology, molecular make-up and biological behavior closely resemble human tumors [73] , and since dogs, in contrast to experimentally available mouse tumor models, are outbred, canine tumor models may provide a highly relevant setting in which to preclinically test the anti-tumor efficacy of DC-targeted vaccines such as CD40-targeted Ad5.",

Convincing evidence obtained over the past decade in a number of ex vivo human and in vivo animal models (see Fig.6 for a comprehensive overview) shows the efficacy of this DC-targeted vaccination approach in terms of immune activation and tumor protection. These preclinical studies thus provide a strong rationale for its clinical application. Presently, we are aiming to produce a cGMP-grade \"two-component\" configuration, i.e. Ad5 encoding the melanoma antigen MART-1, and the sCAR-hCD40L (CFhCD40L) adaptor molecule. This particular configuration for targeted modification of DC in vivo carries several advantages: 1) It offers great flexibility over single-component approaches, ultimately enabling selection of Ad5 vectors carrying specific TAA genes based on TAA expression profiles in the tumor(s) of the patient to be vaccinated. Selected vector(s) can then be complexed with the adaptor molecule prior to intradermal injection. 2) cGMP grade Ad5 vectors encoding various clinically relevant TAA such as MART-1, gp100, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) have already been used in phase I/II clinical trials and were demonstrated to be safe, making them obvious candidates to combine with the CD40-targeting adaptor [12, 20, 74] .",

As MART-1 encoding Ad vectors have already been shown to be clinically safe [12, 20] , we would propose to administer these Ad5 vectors i.d., in a CFhCD40L-complexed configuration in low sub-toxic doses (e.g. 10 8 -10 9 viral particles) and check for 1) targeted transduction of DC in skin and vaccination-site draining LN; 2) maturation of transduced DC from skin and vaccination site-draining LN; and 3) induction and expansion of Mart-1 specific CTL in the vaccination site-draining LN and in peripheral blood. The necessary monitoring techniques have been developed in the context of previous clinical studies on the immunomodulation of melanoma SLN [71, 77, 78] . This study would provide vital confirmation that the CD40-targeted Ad5 vaccine behaves in the same way in patients as observed in our pre-clinical models.

            "text": "Finally, after a decade of pre-clinical development, clinical translation of CD40-targeted Ad vaccines seems within reach. Although we thought we had reached this point before, the many twists and turns in the road, past different CD40-targeted Ad configurations and experimental models (Fig.6) , has helped to refine and strengthen the conceptual basis for the application of our current two-component configuration. As always in translational science, it has led us back -back to the clinic's door. Schematic representation of the mode of action of CD40-targeted Ad-based vaccination. Both Langerhans Cells (LC) and dermal DC can be recruited to the dermis where CD40targeted Ad5 vectors are delivered, leading to selective and high-efficiency in situ transduction of the dermally located, migratory DC. Roughly, three different CD40 targeting configurations can be distinguished: 1) a two-component configuration consisting of a bispecific adaptor fusion protein, binding the Ad5 fiber knob through soluble CAR (sCAR) or an anti-knob mAb; 2) A recombinant Ad5 with CD40L sequences incorporated into the fiber knob; 3) A recombinant mosaic Ad5 virus consisting of CAR-binding ablated wt fibers (\u0394TAYT) and chimeric fibers incorporating CD40L sequences. The transduction and simultaneous activation of LC and dermal DC by CD40-targeted Ad, will result in their maturation and migration to skin draining lymph nodes, followed by presentation of endogenously processed transgenic tumor-associated antigens in the context of MHC molecules to T cells with all the necessary co-stimulatory signals to induce effective activation and expansion of tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells in vivo. CD40-targeted Ad5 vector generation by genetic modification of its fiber. A) A schematic representation of the wild-type trimeric fiber structure of Ad5, comprising an N-terminal tail, a central shaft and a globular knob. B) The structure of bacteriophage T4 fibritin protein containing a central helical domain, a trimerization domain and a C-terminal 6-His motif. Trimeric CD40L was fused to the C-terminus of the artificial fiber. C) A chimeric CD40targeted fiber protein comprising the Ad5 fiber-T4 fibritin-CD40 ligand. Boxes highlight the source of truncated parts of the wild-type fiber, bacteriophage T fibritin and CD40L used for generation of the chimeric fiber protein. The tail of the fiber anchors the fiber-fibritin-CD40L chimera in the Ad virion; a fragment of the fibritin protein provides trimerization of the molecule, while the CD40-ligand mediates binding to CD40 receptor. The long and winding road from the lab to the clinic: a timeline of highlights in the generation and pre-clinical evaluation of a CD40-targeted adenoviral cancer vaccine. 1999: A bispecific antibody conjugate was generated through chemical conjugation of a Fab fragment of a neutralizing anti-fiber-knob monoclonal antibody (mAb) to an agonistic anti-CD40 mAb. Efficient human monocyte-derived DC transduction and induction of maturation by CD40-targeted Ad was demonstrated using this bispecific Ab conjugate [48] . 2000: Using a similar mCD40-targeting chemical conjugate, improved efficacy of an ex vivo generated Bone Marrow-derived DC vaccine against Human Papillomavirus-induced tumor cells in a murine model was demonstrated [54] . 2002: The ability of CD40-targeted Ad to selectively transduce and activate dermally located DC in situ while ensuring their migration and enhancing their antigen specific CD8 + T cell priming ability, was demonstrated using a human skin explant model [50] . 2003: Second generation CD40targeting conjugates for Ad5 consisting of an anti-CD40 single chain Fv fragment fused to either soluble CAR or an anti-Ad5 fiber knob scFv, were developed. The ability of such a second generation CD40-targeting conjugate to enhance gene transfer to DC in vitro and improve their CD8 + T cell activation capacity was demonstrated [55, 56] . 2005: A genetically targeted mosaic Ad vector directed to CD40-expressing cells was generated and its efficiency in transduction and activation of DC in human skin explants was demonstrated [49, 60] . 2006: An effort to translate this configuration to the clinic as a CEAencoding colon cancer vaccine came to a halt when the NIH Biological Resources Branch Oversight Committee deemed the production process and the composition of the resulting mosaic fiber Ad vectors too uncontrolled and unpredictable. 2008: Construction and in vivo biodistribution analysis of a third generation adaptor fusion protein consisting of sCAR and the trimerized TNF-like active domain of CD40L [65] . 2009: The efficacy of a recombinant CD40-targeted Ad vaccine to induce antigen-specific T cell and antibody responses was studied in a canine model [66] . 2010: Using a third generation sCAR-CD40L adaptor protein, selective transduction of mature DC in human lymph nodes and superior induction of high-avidity melanoma-reactive cytotoxic T cells was demonstrated [51] . 2011: Demonstration of in vivo targeting of DC in skin and LN and induction of efficacious antitumor immunity in a therapeutic setting, again using a third generation sCAR-CD40L adaptor in the B16 mouse melanoma model [67] .",

Biopsies are taken of the injection sites (6mm in diameter; asterisks mark examples of post-biopsy scars with exposed dermis) and the explants are cultured floating in medium with the epidermal side up. After 2-3 days migrated DC are harvested for further analyses. B) The transduction rate of skin explant-emigrated DC was determined by flow cytometry. The number of migrated DC per explant was quantitated and the number of migrated transduced DC per explant calculated. Each data point in the graph represents an average of 10-20 explants per tested donor. Differences between untargeted Ad5 and CD40targeted Ad5 were significant in a paired T test (*P<0.05)[50].
