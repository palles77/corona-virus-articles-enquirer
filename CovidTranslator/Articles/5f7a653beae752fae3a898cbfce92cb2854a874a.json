The eukaryotic expression vectors pEGFP-N1/SARS-CoVN and pdsRed2-N1/ CXCL16 were constructed and used to co-transfect HEK293FT cells by the calcium phosphate method. The HIS-tagged fusion protein SARS-CoVN-GFP was then built and purified for the binding assay in vitro. The co-localization of SARS-CoVN and CXCL16 in the cytoplasm of HEK293FT cells was also shown using confocal laser scanning microscopy. It is suggested that their interaction might be through direct combination.",

SARS-CoV N Protein interacts with a number of proteins within the virus or the host cells, which interferes with the cellular cycle and transforms the cellular vital activities by influencing multiple signal transduction pathways of the host cells [4] . The SARS-CoV N protein binding proteins identified in cells include: hnRNPA1 [7, 9, 11] , 14-3-3 protein [11] , cyclin-CDK complex [12] , human Ubiquitin binding enzyme 9 (hUbc9) [3] and cyclophilin A [6] . Recently, N protein was reported to associate with Smad3 and to promote Smad3-p300 complex formation by interfering with the complex formation between Smad3 and Smad4 [15] . However, considering what is known about the host genome, the proteomics and the cellular signal transduction pathways represent only a portion of the interactors. Brunn et al investigated the interaction between SARS-CoV and host cells and discovered that the cross-reactions of the different components of the virus and the interaction between virus and host cells make up a complicated network [1] . Therefore, it is necessary to select the SARS-CoV interaction protein in the host cells with proper modalities, which in return greatly contributes to the elucidation of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and the search for new drug targets. Chang et al employed the SARS-CoV N protein as bait in the Y2H system, and selected 15 interactors of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid from the human embryo-lung cDNA library of Two-Hybridization (LLH). Finally, Immunological coprecipitation (CO-IP) was used to verify the interaction between CXCL16 and SARS-CoV N protein and that this interaction could be blocked by SARS-CoV N antibody [2] . In this paper we continue studying the interaction of SARS-CoV N and CXCL16 both in and out of the cell.",

CXCL16 with chemotactic function exists in the membrane-bound form or secreted form. CXCL16 produces a strong chemotaxis for activated CD8 + T cells, and can also promote the interaction between antigen-presenting cells (APC) and T cells, induce the immune response of specific cell subsets, and regulate the migration of activated T cells in the spleen red pulp [10] . In addition, with the application of CXCL16 monoclonal antibodies, it was discovered that tonsil and CD19+B cells could express the chemokine, indicating that CXCL16 were involved in the cell-cell interactions in chronic inflammation. The only CXCL16 receptor was named CXCR6, and CXCR6-positive T cells play a very important role in some particular diseases [13] . SARS- invasion, and high CXCL16 expression in the mucous membrane areas may affect the ability of HIV infective particle to use the CXCL16 receptor as an assistant receptor [8] .

They were designed and pDC516N was used as a template (with BamH I restriction sites). The amplified fragment was purified by DNA gel extraction kit. The purified product was cloned into pEGFP-N1 to give the Eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N1/SARS-N. After digesting by EcoR I and BamH I, the product was ligated by T4 DNA ligase and transformed into DH5\u03b1 and the recombinant plasmids were obtained. These positive plasmids were identified by both restriction enzyme digestion and PCR amplification, and sequenced to further confirm the inserted gene.

Studies have shown that some viruses can synthesize viral chemokine-binding protein, which can be combined with a variety of chemokines and results in their loss of chemotactic function. For example, myxoma virus can synthesize the viral chemokinebinding protein M-T7. It can inhibit the chemotaxis signals required in the monocyte/M\u03a6 flow, that is, it can integrate with and inhibit CC chemokines. Lalani and others first proved that the purified M-T7 can combine with CXC, CC and C chemokines, and this combination is non-species-specific [6] . Purified M-T7 protein can inhibit infection and blood cell recruitment and activate intimal hyper-plasia which is involved by the inflammatory site. In this study, the eukaryotic expression vector was constructed and the recombinant fusion protein SARS-CoVN with GFP and recombinant protein CXCL16 with RFP were co-expressed in HEK293FT cells. Through confocal laser scanning microscopy, it was observed that CXCL16 showed red fluorescence, and was mainly localized in the cell membrane and cytoplasm; SARS-CoV N, mainly localized in the cytoplasm, showed green fluorescence, in similar locations. The co-localization of the two kinds of protein in the cytoplasm showed orange fluorescence. In our experiment, a eukaryotic expression vector pc-DNA3.1HisA/SARS-CoVN-GFP was also constructed and transfected into HEK293FT cells. A HIS-tagged fusion protein SARS-CoVN-GFP was expressed, purified through the High-Affinity Ni-NTA Resin, and incubated in vitro with HEK293FT cells which had been transfected with pcDNA3.1HisA/CXCL16. Under a fluorescence microscope, it could be seen the SARS-CoVN-GFP fusion protein and the CXCL16-RED protein were co-localized in the cell membrane, which confirmed the two could interact with each other.",
