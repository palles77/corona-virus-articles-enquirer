Previous studies using similar doses in rats found increased ileal villus height (12) , increased disaccharidase activities (12) , and enhanced electroneutral NaCl transport (1 3) in response to corticosteroid. Furthermore, MP (20-30 mg/kg) has been shown to stimulate basal ileal Na and C1 transport (13, 14) and ileal response to combined absorptive stimuli (glucose + alanine + epinephrine) (14) after only 24-48 h of treatment. Because we found MP treatment had no impact on basal jejunal Isc, we conclude that glucocorticoid treatment did not stimulate electrogenic chloride secretion, as reported in rat (15) and rabbit (16) ileum by others. These discrepancies between our data and those reported previously could be attributed to many possible factors, including species specificity, differences in the responses of jejunum and ileum, and the relatively brief period of MP treatment we used.",

In the normal group, the lack of effect of MP probably reflects a functionally mature mucosal disaccharidase pattern in the weaned animal. However, in the TGE-infected epithelium, low disaccharidase activities persisted after MP treatment, despite a lengthening of villi in MP-treated animals. Studies in suckling rats showed the effects of glucocorticoid require emergence of cells from the crypts, with maximal effects on mucosal sucrase after 120 h (1 9). Consequently, we expected an earlier response in TGE epithelia, because enterocyte transit time decreases from approximately 55 to 18 h in this disease (3) . TGE jejunal cells, therefore, differ from those of the developing gut not only in their rapid proliferation but also in their failure to respond by 48 h to adrenocorticoid by synthesis or activation of brush border digestive enzymes.",

Accelerated enterocyte migration, observed after long-term corticosteroid treatment (12) , could have contributed to this observation. In previous studies of suckling rabbits treated with cortisone (5) we attributed precocious development of jejunal glucose-facilitated Na transport to increased lumen to cell driving forces resulting from enhanced Na+-K'-ATPase activity. However, our current data demonstrate increased glucose-stimulated Na absorption in the weaned piglet in the absence of altered Naf-K+-ATPase act!Vlty, suggesting that the glucocorticoid effect observed was independent of the activity of the basolateral membrane Na pump. Rapid activation of the Na+-K+ pump can occur as a result of a sudden increase in intracellular Na (20) . In rabbit descending colon glucocorticoid treatment was recently shown to enhance apical Na permeability (21) , which in turn would rapidly activate Na+-K+-ATPase. Our data do not preclude MP effects on brush border permeability and/or basolateral pump function but they do indicate that MP does not alter Na+-K+-ATPase specific activity in the jejunum and that it has no major effect on basal Na transport in control or TGE jejunum. The augmented jejunal response to o-glucose we observed in the MP-treated infected piglet is compatible with the hypothesis that glucocorticoid alters brush border glucose-Na cotransport, as observed in intestinal brush border membrane vesicles from rats injected with triamcinolone (22) . Alternatively, MP may alter jejunal glucose-Na cotransport simply by increasing absorptive surface area.",

Our data showing villus blunting and a 1 O-f old reduction in mucosal disaccharidases in MP-treated infected piglets suggest the drug did not interfere with exfoliation of infected villus cells. However, the finding of homogeneous immunofluorescence of enterocytes at 96 h, in the MP-treated group only, suggests that glucocorticoid treatment may interfere with viral clearance from the mucosa. Determination of the effects of MP on viral clearance was not the aim of the present study and would require sequential quantitation of virus in the mucosa and intestinal fluid. Our finding, however, is compatible with the theory that MP treatment could facilitate persistence of virus beyond the 40h stage, when it is normally cleared (3) .",
