El coste Introduction Influenza, a highly contagious acute respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus, is associated with an extensive array of clinical symptoms, ranging from self-limiting respiratory conditions in the upper airways to systemic repercussions and potentially fatal complications. 1, 2 Influenza usually occurs in the form of annual epidemics, although it may occasionally give rise to a pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that influenza causes between three and five million cases globally each year; and accounts for approximately 300,000 deaths each season, of which more than 40,000 occur in the European Union. 1, 3 Breastfeeding infants, children with an underlying pathology and adults over 65 years of age are the most susceptible to the severe forms of the disease. 2---4 However, the greatest morbidity is observed in pediatrics, and children represent the main transmitters of the infection. The disease in children is also associated with a substantial economic and social burden. 4---6 The two most common types of influenza virus affecting humans are A and B. The annual influenza epidemics are usually caused by minor variants of both types, 7 such that almost all children are infected in the first years of life and acquire protective immunity exclusively against that particular strain of virus. Since influenza A virus is capable of naturally infecting numerous animal species, it occasionally causes pandemics and generates greater concern among public health authorities than the influenza B virus, which only affects humans. 2, 8, 9 As variation in influenza type A is wide, it is classified into sub-types, based on its HA (hemagglutinin) and NA (neuraminidase) membrane antigens. Antigenic and genetic differences have revealed two lineages of influenza B viruses: Victoria and Yamagata, which have circulated simultaneously around the globe since the 1980s. 8, 10 It is difficult to predict which lineage will dominate during the next influenza season. 11 Vaccination against influenza is an effective way to prevent infection and its complications. 4 Although it is difficult to know the real incidence of the illness due to the non-specific nature of symptoms, 12 accurate data on the burden and medical costs associated with the illness are essential to develop the most appropriate vaccination policy. These data are limited in Spain, therefore this study was designed to quantify emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and the direct medical costs attributable to laboratoryconfirmed influenza in children under 15 years of age that present to hospital with acute respiratory infection (ARI) and/or isolated fever during the influenza season.",

In 2010---2011, the influenza strains recommended by WHO for inclusion in the seasonal trivalent vaccine for the northern hemisphere were two influenza type A (strain analogous to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus; and strain analogous to A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like virus); plus a Victoria lineage of influenza type B (strain analogous to B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus). 19 In our study, the majority of laboratory-confirmed cases of type B influenza corresponded to the Victoria strain. Therefore, the type B lineage recommended in the vaccine corresponded to the type B in circulation during the 2010---2011 influenza season. However, either lineage of type B influenza (Victoria or Yamagata) can predominate in any season 7, 11 and, although the proportion of strains with Yamagata lineage (3.4%) was very low in our study, extensive seasonal variability has been observed. For example, in 2006---2007, 5.5% of B strains were Yamagata lineage compared with 40% in 2007---2008. 20 Notably, WHO recommended the use of tetravalent vaccines (i.e., containing both lineages of type B and type A influenza) for the 2012---2013 season in the northern hemisphere. 21 Some limitations of the study may affect the interpretation of its results. Firstly, the children were all recruited from a hospital emergency department, where cases are more likely to be more serious and subjected to supplementary tests, compared with cases seen in primary care settings. Conversely, the availability of the rapid diagnostic test results means that the proportion of children presenting with an isolated fever who are subsequently hospitalized is lower than when this test is not available. It is possible that the symptoms recorded during the follow-up telephone interviews may have been under-reported. Finally, the study took place during a single influenza season, therefore the findings may be an over-or under-estimation of influenza burden in other seasons. In addition, since the proportion of influenza types A and B and their lineages may vary, it would be of interest to explore the situation over multiple seasons.",

Influenza cases caused by A strains and B strains appear to result in a similar burden in terms of hospitalization and emergency department costs. These could be partially alleviated by appropriate vaccination. The proportion of influenza type A and B during the 2010---2011 season was similar and both lineages of influenza type B (Victoria and Yamagata) were detected among cases of laboratoryconfirmed influenza in our study, although the percentage of the Yamagata lineage was low. In the influenza season during this study, there was a good match between influenza strains in the vaccine and circulating strains as the vaccine protected against A strains and the Victoria B lineage. In seasons with a mismatch, however, the vaccine is likely to provide less protection. Given the burden of influenza shown in this study, giving children under 15 years of age vaccines containing lineages of both influenza type A and type B might help reduce the overall burden of illness. Due to the difficulty in predicting which virus strains will be responsible for future influenza seasons, the use of tetravalent vaccines, with their protection against both B lineage strains in addition to A strains, may provide the broadest protection.",

Among the other causative respiratory viruses, which were isolated in 28.9% (145/501) cases, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) was the most frequently isolated in 52 (10.4%) isolates [RSV A: 37; RSV B: 12; A + B: 3], followed by rhinoviruses in 40 (8.0%) isolates and adenovirus in 30 (6.0%) isolates. The median ages of the children infected with these viruses were 6.0 months (RSV; range: 0---178 months), 15.5 months (rhinovirus, range: 0---164 months) and 25.0 months (adenovirus, range: 2---146 months).

Results of the quantitative RT-PCR for influenza type A showed that around 87% had H1N1 subtype and 13% had H3N2 subtype. There were 370 of 501 children (73.9%) who did not test positive for influenza. Type B positive children were generally older than those infected by type A(Table 1). Among the children positive for influenza type B, the proportion of Victoria and Yamagata lineages were 96.6% (56/58) and 3.4% (2/58), respectively.Coughing was the most frequent symptom in children with laboratory-confirmed influenza (79.4% [104/131]) followed by nasal congestion (67.9% [89/131]) and rhinorrhea (53.4% [70/131]). For each of these symptoms, there was no significant difference in frequency between the virus types (Fig. 1).
