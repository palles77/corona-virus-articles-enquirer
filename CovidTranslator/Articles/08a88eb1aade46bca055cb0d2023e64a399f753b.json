Prominent examples in the last two decades include the emergence of SARS in 2003, the sudden crossing of H5N1 avian influenza virus into humans in 1995, and the unexpected West African outbreak of Ebola virus in 2014. In the last few years Zika virus, thought for decades as causing only a mild febrile illness in East Africa, has emerged to cause significant morbidity in regions as far apart as Polynesia and South America. Difficult to predict, emerging threats to public health are the direct manifestation of a number of factors, singly or collectively, that cause significant changes in the constantly evolving relationship between pathogen and host. There is general agreement that factors include population growth, migration into large conurbations, climatic changes, ease of transportation and changes in human behavior.",

Thus emerging or re-emerging pathogens are more likely to be zoonotic, that is, naturally transmitted from animals to humans. Furthermore, viruses are over-represented in this group, with RNA viruses accounting for a third of all emerging and re-emerging infections.",

First, how the interplay of climate, environment, and human societal pressures can trigger emergence. Second, how viruses can transmit between an established reservoir species and a new host species and what determines pathogenicity in each species. And third, which aspects of these processes offer opportunities for therapy and prevention. To these must be added a broader understanding of how viruses evolve over time; further clues to this are now being uncovered by studying host genetic elements responsible for resisting virus invasion.",

For example, the identification of a virus for the first time and the development of new diagnostic tests can create the impression of a new or increasingly prevalent disease even if the virus is already endemic, through allowing a better definition of the true distribution of infection within the community. In the years following the introduction of new tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, rotavirus, and human papillomaviruses, more accurate recognition of the true extent of infection contributed to a sense of new risks of disease. Of course, some true increase in prevalence had also occurred with some of these examples.",

The slowing in circulation of polioviruses that followed improved sanitary conditions in the early 20th century led to infection being acquired at older ages with a greatly increased rate of paralytic disease. The introduction of more widespread parenteral medical procedures (e.g., parenteral therapy for syphilis, blood transfusion, renal dialysis) led to dramatic outbreaks of hepatitis B caused by a virus that was already endemic in the community. This transmission route has now been largely eliminated by rigorous screening of donated blood and infection control measures, while widespread dissemination of blood-borne infections among intravenous drug users has led to new patterns of disease. Changes in sexual practices and in numbers of sexual partners can affect an individual's exposure to sexually transmitted infections including HIV, and if this applies to groups of individuals or a population, changes in the disease prevalence will be seen.",

This may be the case with Lassa fever, for example, where there is good evidence showing that local communities in West Africa are continually exposed to the virus. Where human-to-human transmission occurs more readily, R 0 approaches 1 and therefore multiple outbreaks may occur.

Even a small extension of a transmission season may have a disproportionate effect, as transmission rates rise exponentially rather than linearly with increasing temperature. Climatic change can also alter vector distributions if suitable areas for breeding become newly available. Again, the effect may be disproportionate, particularly if the vector transmits disease to human or animal populations that lack pre-existing levels of acquired immunity. The result is that clinical cases are more numerous and potentially more severe. Increased temperatures and seasonal fluctuations in either rainfall or temperature favor the spread of vector-borne diseases to higher elevations and to more temperate latitudes. Aedes aegypti, a major vector of dengue, is limited in distribution by the 10\u00b0C winter isotherm, but this isotherm is shifting, thereby threatening an expansion of disease ever further from the equator.",

Outbreaks of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF) in Bolivia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the United States have been linked to abnormal periods of drought or rainfall, leading to unusually rapid increases in rodent numbers. Of all species of mammals, rodents are among the most adaptable to comparatively sudden changes in climate and environmental conditions. Small climatic changes can bring about considerable fluctuations in population size, particularly with those rodents inhabiting desert and semi-desert areas. Such variations are directly related to oscillations in food quantity and quality. A prolonged drought in the early 1990s in the Four Corners region of the United States led to a sharp decline in the numbers of rodent predators, such as coyotes, snakes, and birds of prey. But at the end of the drought heavy rainfall resulted in an explosion in pi\u00f1on nuts and grasshopper populations, which in turn resulted in a rapid escalation of rodent numbers, among them deer mice carrying hantaviruses; the result was the emergence of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.",

This is in marked contrast to just 50 years ago when many people rarely if ever traveled any distance from their place of residence. Frequent air travel is now regarded as a major contributing factor to the spread of emerging diseases as evidenced by the rapid spread of the SARS virus in 2003, when the infection was disseminated from China to at least 17 countries in less than a week. Mathematical modeling can be used to predict those regions most at risk in the event of any future SARS epidemic. Were a vaccine available, the initial spread of virus might be contained if only a third of the population were immunized in the regions where the outbreak is focused. This assumes an index case made a single air journey. However, the risk increases substantially in the event of an index case making two journeys, with the whole population requiring vaccination if the same passenger made three trips. Analysis of air traffic from Mexico at the start of the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic suggests the risk of spread is particularly great when the volume of air traffic is high and the resources to report and trace diseased individuals are very restricted.",

Once established in humans, the diseases could be maintained indefinitely if the numbers of susceptible individuals remained above a certain threshold and in frequent contact with diseased persons.

In developing countries types HEV-1 and -2 are restricted to humans and are spread by the fecal-oral route, usually via contaminated water. On the other hand, in developed countries HEV-3 and -4 infection is a zoonosis, with pigs and some poultry as the main reservoir, leading to sporadic human cases often acquired by ingestion of poorly cooked meat. Pigs become infected around 3 months of age but suffer only a mild, transient infection. Hepatitis E virus infection may be the commonest form of viral hepatitis worldwide; it is probably underdiagnosed but has recently been increasingly reported due to improvements in diagnostic testing and screening.",

This was discovered during an unusually severe outbreak of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). Previously, Reston virus had been first identified in 1990 among non-human primates that had been imported from the Philippines to several primate-handling facilities in the United States and Europe. In contrast to its African relatives, however, Reston virus does not appear to cause human illness, although there is ample evidence of Reston viral antibodies in humans working in primateholding facilities or working with swine. Thus, Reston virus appears to be transmitted by the respiratory route but to possess low virulence, while other Ebola species are highly virulent but do not undergo airborne transmission. Fortunately, no viruses have yet emerged bearing the undesired characteristics of both.",

Influenza A virus is one of the comparatively few viral respiratory pathogens of pigs. Currently three subtypes circulate in swine: H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. Domesticated pigs have often been regarded as a mixing vessel for influenza viruses by allowing the reassortment of the seven viral gene segments presenting an opportunity for new human strains to arise.

Beginning first in Mexico, the new virus subtype often referred to as \"swine flu\" by the popular press, spread rapidly throughout the world in a matter of weeks (see Chapter 25: Orthomyxoviruses). Analyses of human isolates quickly showed the unusual nature of this swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) as being a triple reassortment virus containing genes from avian, human and \"classical\" swine influenza viruses. The ancestors of this virus had probably been circulating in pig populations for over 10 years but had remained undetected. At the time, there was considerable uncertainty as to the pathogenic potential of this virus but data soon showed the severity for humans to be less than that seen with the 1918 pandemic but on a par with the 1957 \"Hong Kong\" pandemic. Transmissibility appeared higher than is normally the case for seasonal influenza with a higher than normal attack rate. Importantly, younger age groups appeared more susceptible, possibly due to partial immunity among older cohorts as a result of being infected during previous pandemics.",

Nearly all cases had been exposed to live poultry or visited live poultry markets, but several very limited family clusters were also reported, suggesting that very limited human-tohuman transmission may also be possible.

Although companion animals have been kept within households over the centuries, the number of known emerging infections from such sources is remarkably few. There are a number of canine homologs of human flaviviruses. The discovery of a canine flavivirus distantly related to human hepatitis C virus (HCV) raises some intriguing questions as to the origin of hepatitis C virus in human populations. Although evidence was found for virus in the canine liver, there is as yet no evidence of this canine hepatitis C-like virus causing liver disease in dogs. Whether or not hepatitis C virus first emerged from dogs remains speculative, but the finding of virus in the respiratory secretions of infected dogs indicates a potential route of transmission to humans. A related flavivirus has been described among seropositive horses in the State of New York. There was no supporting evidence of clinical disease among all the animals tested but this does not preclude a pathogenic potential for humans.",

It is estimated that approximately 350,000 wild-caught animals are traded around the world each year, adding to the risk of potentially zoonotic infections crossing the species barrier into humans. The finding of a new arenavirus in boa constrictors (Boa constrictor) suffering from snake inclusion body disease has raised questions as to how common such viruses might be among captive wild animals. Intriguingly, sequence data from this arenavirus showed diversity compatible with a pre-existing relationship between host and virus over time. Moreover, sequences were found homologous to those of arenaviruses causing severe hemorrhagic fever, e.g., Lassa virus (see Chapter 30: Arenaviruses), but surprisingly the snake arenavirus also shared glycoprotein sequences with filoviruses. This would suggest that there has been recombination along one of the two RNA genome segments at some point in time with an ancestral filovirus that subsequently evolved to become the Ebola and Marburg viruses of today.",

The keeping of prairie dogs is common in the United States, and indirectly led in 2003 to an outbreak of monkey pox in the State of Wisconsin (see Chapter 16: Poxviruses). This totally unexpected occurrence was the result of housing prairie dogs intended for sale in close proximity to small rodents imported from the African continent, most notably rope squirrels (Funisciurus spp.) and Gambian giant rats (Cricetomys spp.). Although there were no fatalities among the reported cases, it presented an opportunity for the spread of monkey pox into the feral mammal population of North America.

Yet others, as exemplified by Zika virus, have been known for decades but until recently thought to not represent a threat to public health. Thus planning a single, integrated strategy against all eventualities is therefore almost impossible. The task may be compounded by the emergence of escape mutants in populations vaccinated against known diseases, the emergence of strains resistant to antiviral therapy, or even the recycling through livestock of attenuated vaccines designed for use exclusively in humans. It is instructive to compare three major emerging disease outbreaks in recent years-HIV/AIDS, pandemic H1N1 swine influenza 2009, and Ebola in West Africa. For each of these, the transmission routes, transmissibility and R 0 together with the case-fatality rates were very different: the rates of spread also varied, and achieving control presented very different problems requiring specific control measures.",

Based on this information, appropriate control measures need to be quickly activated. These often include instituting appropriate isolation and infection control for cases; quarantining of contacts; travel restrictions; enhanced vaccination programs; provision of antivirals; and mobilization of the local health system to manage the predicted increase in hospitalized patients and community anxiety. Time is of the essence, as delays lead inevitably to an escalation in numbers of cases that can overwhelm locally available manpower and capacity. The immediate closure of hospitals was pivotal in limiting the nosocomial spread of Ebola virus in the original outbreaks in Sudan and Zaire in 1996. The importance of early recognition and the availability of local expertise were highlighted in Uganda, where the discovery of the Bundibugyo strain of Ebola virus in 2000 led to the strengthening of local capacity. Cases of Ebola virus in July and August 2012 have been rapidly diagnosed as a result of this regional investment in infrastructure, thus preventing its spread to Kampala, the Ugandan capital. However, outbreaks may spread even in countries fully equipped to deal with infectious disease outbreaks, unless the clinical and epidemiological data can be reviewed quickly and critically and the appropriate control measures instigated.",

            "text": "Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains and cross-species transmission to great apes and humans. Old World monkeys are naturally infected with over 40 different strains of SIV. These strains are species-specific and hence are denoted with a suffix to indicate their species of origin. The three major types of HIV (N, M, and O) each derived from a separate transfer event. Cartoons showing three possible alternative routes of cross-species transmissions giving rise to chimpanzee SIV (SIVcpz) as a recombinant of different monkey-derived SIVs illustrate the possible complexity of the steps leading to the introduction of viruses into a new host. + Vif indicates the presence of an HIV-like Vif, which is required to overcome the virus inhibitory effects of APOBEC3B. (A) Pan troglodytes troglodytes as the intermediate host. Recombination of two or more monkey-derived SIVs (likely SIVs from red-capped mangabeys [SIVrcm] and the greater spot-nosed monkeys [SIVgsn] or related SIVs) and possibly a third lineage requiring co-infection of an individual monkey with one or more SIVs. Chimpanzees have not been found to be infected by these viruses. (B) The SIVcpz recombinant develops and is maintained in a primate host that has yet to be identified, giving rise to the ancestor of the SIVcpz/HIV-1 lineage. P. t. troglodytes functions as a reservoir and was responsible for each of the human introductions. (C) Transfer through an intermediate host (yet to be identified) that is the current reservoir of introductions of SIVcpz into current communities of P. t. troglodytes and P. t. schweinfurthii as a potential source of diverse SIVcpz variants that are each found in limited geographic regions of Africa.
