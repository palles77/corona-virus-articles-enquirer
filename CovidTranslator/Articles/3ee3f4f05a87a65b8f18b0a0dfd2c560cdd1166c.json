However, little knowledge exists on the ability of porcine IL-22 (pIL-22) to fight against viral infection in the gut. In this study, we found that recombinant mature pIL-22 (mpIL-22) inhibited the infection of multiple diarrhea viruses, including alpha coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine rotavirus (PoRV), in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line J2 (IPEC-J2) cells. mpIL-22 up-regulated the expression of the antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin (BD-2), cytokine IL-18 and IFN-l. Furthermore, we found that mpIL-22 induced phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser727 and Tyr705 in IPEC-J2 cells. Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by S3I-201 abrogated the antiviral ability of mpIL-22 and the mpIL-22-induced expression of BD-2, IL-18, and IFN-l. Together, mpIL-22 inhibited the infection of PoRV and enteric coronaviruses, and up-regulated the expression of antimicrobial genes in IPEC-J2, which were mediated by the activation of the STAT3 signal pathway. The significant antiviral activity of IL-22 to curtail multiple enteric diarrhea viruses in vitro suggests that pIL-22 could be a novel therapeutic against devastating viral diarrhea in piglets.",

Unlike most other IL-10-related cytokines, IL-22 primarily targets nonhematopoietic epithelial cells and fibroblasts Sonnenberg et al., 2011; Wolk et al., 2004) . The IL-22 receptor is composed of two heterodimeric subunits, IL-22R1 and a common IL-10R2 of the IL-10 family (Xie et al., 2000) . While the IL-10R2, a shared receptor for IL-10, IL-26, IL-28, and IL-29, is expressed in various tissues, IL-22R1 is primarily expressed in mucosal epithelia such as the intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) (Eidenschenk et al., 2014; Ouyang and Valdez, 2008) .",

Initially, studies determined that IL-22 is essential for the host to control the infection of extracellular bacteria in the lung or gut (Eidenschenk et al., 2014; Ivanov et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2008) . Recent evidence indicates that IL-22 has a substantial role in host defense against mucosal viral infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), influenza virus, and rotavirus (Hernandez et al., 2015; Ivanov et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2013) . The mechanism of IL-22 protection against infection is elusive and includes the direct promotion of epithelial survival and regeneration and the maintenance of the tissue barrier, but IL-22 also induces epithelial-secreting antimicrobials such as defensins and antiviral cytokines such as IL-18 (Hernandez et al., 2015; Munoz et al., 2015; Ouyang and Valdez, 2008) . Furthermore, IL-22 increases its protective role when combined with IL-18 or IFN-l (Hernandez et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014) . Given the critical role of IL-22 in epithelial regeneration, host defense, and pathology, IL-22 is an attractive target for clinical development in animals and humans. However, little knowledge exists regarding porcine .",

PEDV and TGEV are alpha coronaviruses (Brian and Baric, 2005) , and PoRV is a member of the genus Rotavirus within the Reoviridae family (Taniguchi and Komoto, 2012) . All three diarrhea viruses primarily infect villous epithelial cells throughout the small intestine and cause serious injury of IEC, including severe diffuse atrophic enteritis and superficial villous enterocyte swelling . The manifestations of the infection of the three viruses are indistinguishable and characterized by vomiting, anorexia, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and weight loss, with a high morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets Zhang et al., 2013) . The co-infection of two or three viruses of PEDV, TGEV, and PoRV in the field is frequent and makes the development of therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to protect suckling pigs against diarrhea complications (Zhang et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2016) .",

Like PoRV, PEDV and TGEV primarily infect small intestinal epithelial cells and cause a similar injury of the intestines with similar clinical signs. We reasoned that mpIL-22 is also capable of curtailing PEDV and TGEV infection in IPEC-J2, as it does in rotavirus infection. Similar to the rotavirus experiment, we stimulated IPEC-J2 cells with mpIL-22 for 24 h before inoculating with PEDV or TGEV. As we expected, mpIL-22 treatment inhibited PEDV and TGEV infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A) . Pretreatment with 400 ng/ml of mpIL-22 resulted in a more than 90% reduction in infection of PEDV and TGEV, whereas 40 ng/ml mpIL-22 caused a 93.82 \u00b1 0.34% and 68.13 \u00b1 7.34% inhibition of PEDV and TGEV infection, respectively. The anti-coronavirus activity of mpIL-22 was further confirmed by western blotting the N protein expression levels and exhibited a dose-dependent manner for mpIL-22 treatment at 48 hpi compared to those in the control cells (Fig. 3B ). PEDV and TGEV showed a different sensitivity to the antiviral activity of mpIL-22; mpIL-22 exhibited a more efficient inhibition of the PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 than TGEV (Fig. 3) . mpIL-22 exhibited a significant suppression of PEDV infection from 1 ng/ml (Fig. S2) .

Following infection with PEDV, TGEV, or PoRV, IPEC-J2 cells secreted markedly higher amounts of pIL-22 than the uninfected IPEC-J2 cells. However, the kinetics profile of pIL-22 production was variable following different virus infection. The production of pIL-22 was maintained at a plateau level during the entire PEDV infection period while pIL-22 declined gradually after peaking at 6 hpi for TGEV infection. For PoRV, pIL-22 was induced and increased steadily from 6 to 48 hpi.

            "text": "The mechanism of the antiviral activity of IL-22 remains elusive. IL-22 has been linked to elicit the expression of antimicrobial defensins, synergistically cooperate with another mucosal antiviral cytokine IFN-l, and promote the tissue barrier in IEC to curtail mucosal viral infection. We herein found that porcine IL-22 induced the expression of protective genes BD-2, IFN-l, and IL-18 in IPEC-J2, especially IFN-l, which primarily acts on mucosal epithelial cells and exhibits robust antiviral activity within the mucosal surface. Our previous results have demonstrated that porcine IFN-l substantially curtailed PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 and Vero E6 cells in vitro (Li et al., 2016) . Previous studies of rotavirus in mice have shown that IL-22 enhances the antiviral activity of IFN-l to synergistically amplify the STAT1 signal pathway induced by IFN-l (Hernandez et al., 2015) . Here we reasoned that IL-22 may boost the antiviral activity of IFN-l by promoting the production of IFN-l. IL-18, a member of the IL-1 family, is induced by TLR5 activation in IEC and mutually enhanced the antiviral activity of IL-22 (Zhang et al., 2014) . IL-22 is indispensable for the induction and maintenance of the expression of IL-18 by IEC during infection with Toxoplasma gondii (Munoz et al., 2015) . Our results further reinforce the notion that the synergetic feedback loop between IL-22 and IFN-l or IL-18 acts on IEC for the protection of the intestine against infection. Therefore, the positive feedback loop among IL-22, IL-18, and IFN-l consists of a complex mutual regulating cytokine network in the gut and provides synergistic innate immunity to combat mucosal virus infection. Our results and the findings from other groups indicate that the combination of IL-22 with IL-18 or IFN-l is a potential therapeutic strategy to fight against gut viral pathogens. PEDV, TGEV, or PoRV infection enhanced the endogenous production of IL-22 by IPEC-J2 (Fig. 6 ). This indicates that pIL-22 potentially exerts a protective role in the control of swine enteric coronaviruses (PEDV and TGEV) and PoRV in the host given the significant viral suppression of mpIL-22 in vitro. The previous results of the rotavirus in vivo mouse model have demonstrated that the IL-22 endogenously produced by IEC has a critical role in restricting enteric virus infection in vivo (Hernandez et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014) . Given the frequent co-infection of the three porcine diarrhea viruses in the field (Zhang et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2016) , pIL-22 could provide a novel approach to control the devastating diarrhea of suckling piglets. We are investigating the therapeutic benefits of pIL-22 alone or combined with IFN-l against viral enteric infection in vivo.",
