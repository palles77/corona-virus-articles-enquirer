However, it is easy to miss the diagnosis of early ground glass opacity (GGO) with plain chest radiography. Thus, computed tomography (CT), especially high-resolution CT (HRCT), is used for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 disease infection (6\u00c09). High-resolution CT allows objective evaluation of the lung lesions, thus enabling us to better understand the pathogenesis of the disease. With serial CT examinations, the occurrence, development, and prognosis of the disease can be comprehensively understood. Due to the high infectivity of the disease, histopathological examination has been limited. The advantage of CT over histologic examination is that CT can evaluate the whole lungs whereas histology is subject to sampling error, as it looks at only localized regions of the lungs. Here, we report the imaging findings and temporal progression of this disease.",

These findings indicated the characteristics of the spread of the lesions along the airway, starting with invasion of the bronchioles and alveolar epithelium of the cortical lung tissues, and extending gradually from the periphery to the center. The shapes of the lesions were nodular or patchy GGOs, with the blood vessels seen thickening and passing through the GGO. This was accompanied by the thickening of interlobular and intralobular septa, and the appearance of halo signs around the nodules (14, 15) (Fig. 5) . The pathological basis may be congestion of alveolar septal capillaries, exudation of fluid into the alveoli and interstitial edema of the interlobular septum.",

The GGOs and the consolidations coexisted, showing both newly formed lesions and original lesions with partial absorption (Fig 7) . The mechanism of this pathology could be as follows: a large amount of cellular exudate accumulated in the alveolar cavity, causing interstitial vasodilation and exudation, and fusion of alveoli. The \"crazy paving appearance\" was apparent, suggesting the thickened interlobular and intralobular septae, and reflecting interstitial In the severe phase of COVID-19, the pulmonary lesions generally reached peaked around 14 days after the onset of the disease, but a few cases developed rapidly, with the lesions appearing bilaterally with diffuse infiltration of all segments of the lungs, and manifesting as \"white lung.\" Air bronchograms (Fig 8) , suggested a large amount of cellular exudation in the alveolar cavity. Subsegmental atelectasis or reduction of lung volume was sometimes noted, and a small amount of pleural fluid could be seen bilaterally. The clinical symptoms were consistent with the severe type clinical manifestation. However, unlike SARS, occurrence of both pneumo-mediastinum and subcutaneous gas were rare (18, 19) .",

Furthermore, since the COVID-19 pneumonia and other viral pneumonias have overlapping imaging manifestations, AI deep learning algorithms may prove beneficial in providing new insights for the differential diagnosis. CT plays an important role in the diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. In the early phase, multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes emerge, and show a distribution starting near the pleura or bronchi rather than pulmonary parenchyma.
