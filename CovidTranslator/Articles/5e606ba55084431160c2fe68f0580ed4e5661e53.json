Morphological studies use optical and electronic microscopes to determine the physical damage on the cell-wall and the possible cell lysis that confirms the viability and microorganism death. The key parameters of the tailoring the surface of the photoactive nanostructures such as the metal functionalization with bacteriostatic properties, hydrophilicity, textural porosity, morphology and the formation of heterojunction systems, can achieve the effective eradication of the microorganisms under natural conditions, ranging from practical to applications in environment, agriculture, and so on. However, to our knowledge, a comprehensive review of the microorganism/nanomaterial interface approach has rarely been conducted. The final remarks point the ideal photocatalytic way for the effective prevention/eradication of microorganisms, considering the resistance that the microorganism could develop without the appropriate regulatory aspects for human and ecosystem safety.

This phenomenon generates the charge carriers known as hole-electron pairs. The photogenerated hole can migrate to the surface of the material and react with water molecules or hydroxyl ions to produce hydroxyl radicals, while the photoexcited electron in the conduction band can react with the adsorbed molecular oxygen to produce superoxide ions [8] . Since the report of Fujishima and Honda about the water splitting process using a TiO2 electrode under UV irradiation, numerous studies have exploited the photoactive properties of this material [9, 10] . Several reviews have studied the relationship between the electronic properties of TiO2 with its photoactive performance based on experimental results and theorical data based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) [11, 12] . Titanium dioxide has three main crystalline structures, the anatase, rutile and brookite. Among them, anatase is the polymorph which exhibits the higher photocatalytic behavior with a band gap energy of 3.2 eV, corresponding to an absorption edge at 385 nm [11] . Other materials structurally related to TiO2, resulting from thermal, hydrothermal and physicochemical modification where titanium is the main element, such as titanates and perovskites, can also be considered as TiO2-based materials.",

Fig. 2 shows the number of scientific publications reported since year 2000 using the terms TiO2 and photocatalysis. As it seen, the amount of reports on the photoactive properties of titanium dioxide is constantly increasing and this trend will surely continue in the coming years. Moreover, studies on the removal of microorganisms using the photocatalytic properties of TiO2 also exhibits an exceptional boom, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2 . The first report about the inactivation properties of TiO2 is attributed to the work done by Matsunaga and co-workers [13] . In that study, the authors studied the photocatalytic sterilization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast using a platinumloaded TiO2 material.

Maness et al., reported that in the presence of TiO2, the peroxidation of polyunsaturated phospholipid components is carried out [15] . As consequence, several essential functions of the cell membrane such as respiratory activity, are lost. Furthermore, the photocatalytic disinfection with TiO2 is commonly explained by the attack of the cell membrane through the reactive oxygen species (ROS) such a hydroxyl radicals and superoxide ions generated on the surface of the irradiated photocatalyst [16] . For instance, several studies have reported that gram-positive bacteria are efficiently inactivated by O2ions, while gram-negative are inactivated mainly through \u00b7OH radicals [17, 18] . This difference in the disinfection mechanism could be attributed to the different properties in their membranes [19] .

In this sense, several strategies to enhance the photoactivity have been raised such as the morphological control and the formation of heterojunction systems with other components like metals, semiconductors and carbonaceous materials. In this review, these strategies are analyzed to elucidate the enhanced photocatalytic features of TiO2 in the disinfection processes of pathogenic and model microorganisms. Furthermore, the novelty of this work lies in the exhaustive review about the interfacial interactions of the TiO2 with the cell wall of the microorganisms with the aim of achieving a better understanding of the photocatalytic annihilation mechanism, as it will be discussed in the following sections. It is well-known that the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 depends strongly on its size and morphology. Titanium dioxide is mainly used as nanoparticles for any study of its photoactivity. However, other well-defined morphologies have shown outstanding performances for the photocatalytic annihilation of pathogenic microorganisms. For instance, the nanotube architecture exhibits an excellent behavior in the eradication of microorganisms due to its intrinsic features such as large surface-to-volume ratio and improved light harvesting [23] . Recently, TiO2 nanotubes has been used for the elimination of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas fluorescence, Deinococcus radiodurans and Sphaerotilus natans [23, 24, 25, 26] . The preparation of self-organized TiO2 nanotube arrays is usually carried out through a conventional anodization process using titanium foil as substrate [25, 26] .",

On the other hand, the deposition of metal nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2 also represents an efficient strategy in the photocatalytic improvement of this material. The contact between the metal nanoparticles and the surface of a semiconductor can create an electric field facilitating an interfacial process of electron transfer from the photoexcited semiconductor to the deposited metal, see [45] . The formed Schottky barrier acts as an efficient electron trap, decreasing the probability of recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers increasing the photocatalytic behavior of the system.

Silver-TiO2 composites are commonly prepared by photoreduction under UV light, sol-gel method and incipient wet-impregnation [47, 48, 49] . As the Fermi level of TiO2 is very high as compared to silver, the electron transfer from the conduction band of the semiconductor to the silver nanoparticles is thermodynamically feasible [50, 51] . The Schottky barrier formed in the physical junction of both materials hinders the electrons transfer from silver to TiO2. However, silver exhibits LSPR under visible-light where the collective oscillation of its electrons can yield an inter band excitation, providing enough energy to electrons that move to the interface to surmount the Schottky barrier [51] . The LSPR properties can be tuned depending on the size and shape of the metallic Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) [52] . For example, Akhavan have reported the preparation of silver nanoparticles with sizes ranged from 3 to 20 nm exhibiting a broad absorption band at 410 nm [53] . The migration of plasmon-induced electrons to the conduction band of TiO2 could cause the corrosion of the silver nanoparticles causing the liberation of soluble Ag + ions. Both, metallic Ag nanoparticles and Ag + ions, have exhibited antibacterial activity by themselves [54, 55] . The Ag + ions can attach to the cell wall membrane changing its properties and providing an increase in the membrane permeability, which leads to a continuous release of cellular components [50] . The silver ions can also form complexes with the DNA and RNA of the microorganisms causing the loss of cellular replication capacity [56, 57] . In addition, these metal ions can interact with thiol groups in proteins, providing the inactivation of respiratory enzymes J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 [53] .

According to theoretical studies based on the DFT theory, the incorporation of Cu ions in the TiO2 should be less than 0.3 at. % to cause a substitution in the crystal lattice [69] . In this sense, the Cu 2+ /Cu + ions can replace the Ti 4+ from the TiO2 crystal lattice resulting in the formation of single and double oxygen vacancies [69] . In consequence, Cu-doped TiO2 increases its charge-transfer resistance and decreases the capacitance, in addition to exhibiting a shift in the optical absorption edge to the visible region which indicates a narrowing of the band gap in the semiconductor [70] .

During the photodeposition, the distribution of the valence states changed with the pH value. In this sense, the amount of Pt (0) was higher than the other valence states under slightly acidic conditions of the irradiated suspension.

[80, 81] Besides, a S-scheme heterojunction has also been proposed from the Z-scheme basis. [82] In this sense, the S-scheme system is composed of two n-type photocatalytic semiconductors representing an oxidation and a reduction photocatalyst. In this transfer mechanism, the driving force mainly comes from the internal electric field of the system. [83] TiO2 has been widely reported in the formation of heterojunction systems with other semiconductors for the degradation of organic pollutants, hydrogen production from water splitting and for CO2 photoreduction [84, 85, 86] . However, only a few TiO2 coupled systems have been studied for photocatalytic disinfection of pathogenic microorganisms. Table 1 summarizes the previous works on TiO2-based heterojunction systems reported for the photocatalytic inactivation of several microorganisms. The graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a polymer semiconductor that has attracted a wide attention as photocatalyst in the last decade since the first report of its use for hydrogen production through the water splitting process [108] . The narrow band-gap energy of g-C3N4 is explained from its delocalized conjugated \u03c0 structures based on tris-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f s-triazine units connected with planar amino groups [109] . When the graphitic carbon nitride is excited under visible light irradiation, the separation of the electrons from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the holes in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) takes place. This phenomenon is similar to the transition of the photogenerated electrons that migrate from the valence band to the conduction band in a semiconductor. Recently, the g-C3N4/TiO2 hybrid system has been reported for the photocatalytic disinfection of the E. coli bacteria under visible light irradiation [88] . The dose of the hybrid system was 0.6 g/L, as shown in Ag nanoparticles on its surface. The coexistence of the Ag and AgX in the ternary system helps to extend the light-response range to the visible light region due to the surface plasmon resonance of the Ag nanoparticles and the as-sensitized AgX [101] .",

This material is composed of one atom-thick layer of sp 2 hybridized carbon atoms forming six-member rings arranged in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice [112] . For production of graphene, several procedures have been used to carry out the exfoliation of the \u03c0-stacked carbon layers such as the chemical vapor deposition and the micromechanical cleavage of graphite [113, 114] . A common procedure used due to its simplicity and low cost is the Hummers method, which consists of the strong oxidation of the bulk graphite, its exfoliation and the subsequent thermal or chemical reduction [115, 116] . As the complete removal of the oxygen functional groups caused by the oxidation process may not be complete, the reduced form is commonly referred to as reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Due to the ballistic transport exhibited by graphene, the coupling of this material with TiO2 increases the photoactive properties of the semiconductor by reducing the recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers. In this sense, graphene/TiO2 and reduced graphene oxide/TiO2 have been used in disinfection process of water contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms [117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123] .

Kongkan and Kamat have reported that the SWCNTs in contact with photoirradiated TiO2 can store up to one electron per 32 carbon atoms [127] . In this sense, the photogenerated electrons in TiO2 can be transferred and stored in the carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Due to their high electron accepting properties, the CNTs can delocalize these charge carriers and thereby increase the photocatalytic performance of The activated carbon-supported TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2/AC) has been studied for the photocatalytic inhibition of the E. coli bacteria [134, 135] . It has been shown that carbon in activated carbon (AC) can reduce the TiO2 to form some Ti 3+ ions [135] . By acting as active centers, the Ti 3+ ions can trap the photoexcited electrons thus decreasing the recombination rate of the charge carrier pairs. Other carbonaceous material, the chitosan, has also been used in the preparation of TiO2 nanocomposites for the inactivation of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus [136] . Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide composed of \u03b2-(1-4) D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units which has exhibited antimicrobial properties towards bacteria, viruses and fungi [137, 138] . In addition, it is worth noting the carbon doping of TiO2. The incorporation of carbon atoms within the crystal structure of titanium dioxide provides an extended absorption to the visible light range and an efficient separation of the photogenerated charge carriers [139, 140] . The simplest procedure for carrying out the preparation of Cdoped TiO2 is the use of carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose as carbon precursors [141, 142] . In this way, the incorporation of the carbonaceous species in TiO2 occurs during the calcination process of the organic precursors.",

Pathogenicity implies the ability to cause damage or disease, but in fact, it has been reported that these characteristics only exist in the context of a susceptible host [143] . This means that a specific pathogen will be involved according to the infection conditions and the features of the host organism. Of course, some bacteria are certainly adapted to favor damage like encapsulated bacteria that prevent phagocytic cells from seeing them and, therefore, prevent their immediate elimination by the innate immune system of the host [144] . The The microorganisms could be controlled by cultivating in petri dishes to understand the real conditions of reproduction. The experimental conditions can be adjusted, as the phases of the microbial growth and the conditions of the environment (pH, temperature, light, oxygen, osmotic pressure, and so on). In addition, the effects of specific chemical species and the growth factors on a particular cell type in culture can be monitored. In a process of manipulation, the microorganisms can be genetically isolated, purified or cloned. In this way, the mutant microorganisms serve to study the response of the specific physiological function [145] . In this sense, some microorganisms have been used as a model to understand the behavior of others, such as the Escherichia coli bacteria and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, due to their rapid growth rate, simple nutritional requirements, (glucose, carbon, and nitrogen) and because their genome is completely sequenced and is easily manipulated.",

            "text": "The photocatalytic eradication of microbes using TiO2-based nanomaterials is supported by the formation of the charge carriers known as hole-electron pairs, at least under wet conditions [156] . A large number of microorganisms also absorb light producing photochemical reactions for sensitized processes inside, and also to cause direct photolysis of nucleic acids [157] . The effectiveness of the photo-eradication will depend to a great extent on microbial growth conditions, susceptibility to ROS, the shape and texture of the nanomaterial and the intrinsic ability to activate the defense J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f against oxidative stress caused by the light irradiation. A possible operational mechanism that effectively kills a microbial cell may require three synchronized ways. Fig. 6a shows a schematic representation in order to understanding the pathway. The ways to obtain an effective microbial photo-killing will consider (i) the photoactive generation of ROS and secondary reactive species by the TiO2 nanomaterial when irradiated with the appropriate radiation that can activate the defense mechanism of the microorganism and start stressing the cell body. This phenomenon can lead to a damage in the organic composition of the microbe derived from the oxidation and reduction reactions in the external wall and the cellular secretions, altering the permeability of the cell membrane [158, 159] . Algae and some bacteria can use light to generate energy, sensitizing chemical reactions and perform life functions in dependence of the wavelength of the irradiated light [160] . Normally, UV-C light causes cell lysis and damages cells to death.",

For instance, a handful of fertile soil which provides 90% of all food contains between 10,000 to 50,000 different types of microorganisms [164] . An analogous situation could be extrapolated to water, air and human body [165] . These microorganisms really matter, not only as commensals but also as predators of other microbes, decomposers of organic substances and, significantly, as the way to control the life chains that sustain ecosystems. The presence of microorganisms is not always dangerous, but also necessary [166] . Some bacteria are versatile and can live in different environments. The modification of the natural growth conditions such as pH, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f temperature and nutrient medium also affect the photocatalytic mechanism. The primary conditions must be maintained to protect the equilibrium of the system but considering the possible resistance to antibiotics.

Harmful J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f green tide, Tetraselmis suecica has been photo-killed in 150 min using a strip coated with a silver-TiO2 material [174] . The strip of low density glass material allows it to float in the water and the photocatalytic material works using the solar radiation. An analogous system that uses a glass bottle similar to SODIS process has allowed the discoloration/mineralization of the Eosin Y dye after 150 min under natural solar radiation. The immobilization of TiO2-based materials in foamed waste-glass strips can be easily achieved by the use of a sonochemical method and can be used in real conditions of algae blooms using natural sunlight [175] . Under real conditions, it is crucial to consider the effect of the water quality, the types of microorganisms that live in the bodies of water and the content of organic and inorganic matter therein. It is unlikely that UV radiation from the solar flux is not effective enough to control microbes because to its defense against radiation and current evolution [176] , i.e. it was reported that around 37% of the viruses died by UV light. UV radiation kills viruses by chemically modifying their genetic material, DNA and RNA. Also, TiO2 coatings can help prevent the proliferation of microbes in atmospheric conditions [171, 172] .",

Almost all methods of photocatalytic inhibition only reach a 2 or 4-Log inactivation. In this regard, the 4-Log (99.99%) inactivation is typically required to achieve a quality of drinking water. The resistance is associated with the viral J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f characteristic, because as is well-known, a pathogenic characteristic of the virus is the induction of oxidative stress that breaks the intracellular redox balance. The activity of TiO2 films after 6 h of illumination has shown a 100% antiviral effect against herpes simplex [201] . No previous work has directly detected ROS activity, with the exception of one study that discard another possible mechanism by adding H2O2 to the experimental system. The authors of the above study observed that the addition of 50 mM H2O2 did not enhance the inactivation compared to the H2O2-free solutions, and therefore, they attributed the photoinactivation to a photocatalytic effect exerted by an iron oxide-coated sand (IOCS) [202] . The detection methods used to measure replication has been performed by qPCR, immunohistochemistry and hemagglutination reaction. The morphological study in the H1N1 virus was carried out by SEM, after being treated with HA/TiO2 and an irradiation exposure for 60 min. The rod-like shape virus was decomposed, and the outer membrane of the viruses have been glued together [203] . As in other microorganisms, the damage could be due to destabilization of the capsid, but this has not been demonstrated yet. The morphological changes, after photocatalytic study of viruses could be approached by atomic force microscopy (AFM), which has a high potential due to its high resolution in dry samples and the ability to observe microorganisms in a liquid medium, although the resolution is compromised due to medium and soft of the samples. However, most of the tests carried out so far on photoinactivation of microorganisms have been carried out on samples previously dried in the air, which greatly impairs their conservation [204, 205, 206, 207] .

For instance, a previous study by EPR analysis showed that the initial rate of the \u2022OH radical formation was 1.0 x 10 -8 rad-mol s -1 mg -1 , which were the only reactive species that reached the surface of a polymer-TiO2 thin film to induce cellular disruption of the P. aeruginosa [164] . The reactive species in combination with gene chip experiments and shotgun proteomics reveal that the ability to protect and repair DNA and proteins, in addition to promoting the coenzyme-dependent respiratory chain of P. aeruginosa cells, is further disrupted by the high biocidal performance of the TiO2-based nanomaterials [164]. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses show that the AgNPs in aqueous solutions leach some Ag + cations, which subsequently pass to B. subtilis cells and interact to form Ag2O organic complexes. These complexes disrupt the bacteria by damaging their cell membranes and degrading chromosomal DNA [191] . This is in accordance with the annihilation of B. cinerea, where different silver species were detected by XPS [32] . Other spectroscopies, such the ATR-FTIR technique, can be used ",

Mutants affected in recG but not in oxyR were dramatically damaged in the repair of DNA damage, as it was measured by sensitivity to UV radiation, demonstrating that recG participates in the DNA repair, [225] Fig. 11H . Nevertheless, overexpression of genes does not always increase a product as seen before in the exposure to Tetrahymena thermophilic to protein-coated AgNP, where the metallothionein genes were overregulated but the intracellular levels of SOD and CAT were not elevated [198] . The mechanism of toxicity of nanosized bulk CuO for freshwater ciliated protozoa Tetrahymena thermophile has also been studied. The exposure of nCuO (EC50) for 24 h significantly decreased the proportion of the two major unsaturated fatty acids, while increasing the relative amount of two saturated fatty acids, Fig. 11C ,D.

In an aqueous medium, the TiO2 agglomerated particles are around 100 nm (0.1 \u03bcm). The particle size plays a central role in the performance of TiO2 and its toxicology [237] . Concerning the antimicrobial efficacy of the powders and coatings, the particle size should be adequate to have an effective interaction with the cells. With nanometric sizes, it is likely that the photocatalyst penetrates the cell wall of the microorganism and damages it, while with larger sizes the material can be confused with a virus, which increases the possibility of rejection. The morphology of the material is also crucial for human cells. WHO has established guidance documents on regulations for the transport of infectious substances and their disposal [240, 241] . Hospitals and laboratories must also J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f follow good practices not only for laboratory work, but also for waste disposal.

However, due to its strong oxidative ability, TiO2 can degrade the textile fibers if it is in direct contact with them. To avoid this issue, the photocatalyst is blended with materials such as silica (SiO2) and apatite that serve as spatial hindrances, thus preventing the decomposition of the fibers [264, 265] .",

The spores can contain toxins and easily introduce in human and animal bodies. Mold spores in the air are produced by microorganisms for reproduction purposes and are considered allergenic, so they can infect a vulnerable host such as the elderly or children and can damage plants in large monoculture areas.

In the case of antibacterial applications, the surface of the nanostructured material may have additional advantages such as bacteriostatic and mechanical features that could increase the photocatalytic annihilation of the pathogenic microorganism. These properties are intrinsic to the TiO2-based materials and are enhanced by the doping or impregnation of the surface with some metal nanoparticles that exhibit antibacterial properties. The mechanical effect depends on the morphology (0D-3D), agglomeration, size and concentration of the material. It is well known that TiO2 is a pathophysiological semiconductor that inhibits the reproduction of microorganisms in aqueous environments[168]. Formally, the Scheme (b) infigure 6can be applied to any photocatalyst that aims to annihilate a microorganism. The interface between the nanostructure and the external cell wall of the microorganism is the key to understanding and obtaining a fast and effective photo-killing of the microbes. The electrons and the holes (e -/h + ) are available at the irradiated nanostructure generating ROS that begin to stress the microorganism, whether the semiconductor material has an intrinsic bacteriostatic effect or not. The mechanism of defense of the microorganism activates the secretion of biofilms (synthesized and released by the microorganism) in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f order to dilute or block the oxidizing chemical species in time. In that case, the concentration of ROS must be crucial to challenge the mechanism of defense. At this point, the damage, penetration or lysis of the cell wall seems difficult depending on the concentration of the ROS, its continuous generation and the effective contact with the microorganism that will be enclosed by the secreted biofilm. Fortunately, the death could occur due to a disruption of the cellular function. In this case, the microorganism can discharge all its cellular content by trying to survive[158]. Since TiO2 normally has a hemispherical-like morphology, the mechanical damage due to contact will depend on the size of the particles to reach the permeation of the cell wall or to cover it. The inhibition of the agglomeration of TiO2 is crucial together with the suspension stability and of course, the absence of photo-corrosion. The roughness and defined morphology of the photocatalyst must be beneficial to carry out the cellular lysis of the microbes through mechanical damage. In addition, the bacteriostatic effect could stop the reproduction of the microorganism thus restricting its exponential reproduction.The morphological cell damage and biofilm secretion, as a slimy protective tool of the microorganism for the dilution of antibiotics, depends on each microbe. For example, P. syringae bacteria shows bleb formation with the outer membrane vesicles and deformation of the outer membrane after secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by photo-treatment with AgNPs-titanate nanotubes to try to prevent the penetration of nanoparticles[31,32].Fig. 7. illustrates P. syringae cells after emptying their cellular content[153]. B. cinerea was annihilated by faster stress oxidation, cell invagination and vacuolization by secretion of complete cellular content[32]. Bacteria and fungi prefer to live on the surface, covering rocks, soils and tree J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f trunks. In the case of algae or planktonic bacteria, they float in bloom colonies on the sea surface, coloring the ecosystems due to the formation of biofilms.",

CM: Cell membrane Thus, the mechanical, photochemical and bacteriostatic routes can boost and ensure the death of the pathogenic microorganism; however, cell lysis is not always likely. Adequate irradiation in the process is also very important since the obstruction or insufficient illumination decrease the generation of reactive oxygen species. The hydrophilicity and the point of zero charge (pzc) are also important to ensure effective contact. In brief, the irradiance, wavelength and the properties of the photocatalyst (morphology, size, bacteriostatic effect, point of zero charge, and so on) are essential to stimulate the annihilation of the microorganism. Thin films are the most applicable in real conditions. Kubacka and collaborators reported the use of TiO2-based polymer films that rapidly induce cell lysis or cell wall J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f modifications of P. aeruginosa due to the attraction of TiO2 by phospho-proteins andphospho-peptides[166].

Microwave radiation also contributes to complete the spectrum of sunlight. The UV and infrared radiation are some of the reasons why sunlight can help control the population of environmental microorganisms. However, the increase in the discharge of domestic and industrial pollutants to bodies of water alters the conditions of the ecosystem, which favors the proliferation of some algae blooms causing eutrophication and loss of biodiversity[170]. The inactivation of microorganisms by sunlight depends on the absorption of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f photons to induce chemical changes in the cell structure[157].

Even in the strictest control, there are some circumstances that cannot be eliminated because they are part of the protocol, e.g. the diluents where the nanomaterial is suspended or the affectation that could cause the illumination at certain wavelength. In some microorganisms, a certain wavelength could develop metabolic changes that could be attributed to the nanomaterial[177,178], thus providing incorrect results. For this reason, it is necessary to have a specimen control or controls that suffer all the possible damage and the morphological changes before fixed and for those artifacts caused during the processing of the sample in each analytical technique. The morphological tests by SEM and TEM are sometimes not enough to know if a cell is alive or dead, so it should have a support assay like colony-forming unit, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), direct quantification with fluorescent markers also based on the membrane integrity, quantification of polymerase chain reaction products (qPCR), and so on.

The Gram-negative cell wall has some resistance against hydroxyl radicals in oxidative stress, but this situation changes with the nature of the photocatalytic material. The biogenic synthesis of AgNPs in Chlorella pyrenoidosa produces capped crystalline nanoparticles with enzymes and proteins that confer stability and facilitate the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f penetration with a better photocatalytic activity than the AgNPs prepared by a chemical route[179]. Feng et al.[184] used gold nanoparticles functionalized with cationic polyelectrolyte PAH. The TEM analysis showed a close interaction with the cell surfaces and induced a considerable damage and toxicity to the membrane of the bacteria. PAH-AuNPs do not get inside cells but cause cell death[180]. On the other hand, Ag-TiO2 nanoparticles were observed around the damaged bacterial cells. These nanoparticles penetrate the cell wall and enter into the cells, which subsequently causes damage or the death of the microorganisms. It has been proposed that a group of protein-channels called porins could allow the passage of small hydrophilic antibiotics and metabolites to the cell[178]. The use of TiO2 with metallic nanoparticles increases the sensitivity of the bacteria and triggers the penetration into the cell. However, outside or inside the bacteria, the damage begins with the membrane, followed by the inhibition of EPS, the central part of the cytoplasm decreases in density, increases in size, there is little DNA along the cell, few inclusion bodies, formation of many collapsed cells and finally, aggregates of dead cells. The mechanism of general annihilation is fully illustrated by TEM with the treatment with E. coli and Ag3TNs. The capsule lost the rod shape, shows blebs and some parts are disrupted. Prior to the total damage in the cell, the peptidoglycans layer becomes anomalously wide[31].",

The ultrastructural analysis shows that the morphology of the nanotubes damages the cell, inside the vacuolation of the conidia and the invagination begins to expand the vacuoles and the size of the conidia increases.

Types of heterojunction systems based on two semiconductors. A type-I heterojunction is composed by two semiconductors where a semiconductor A has a conduction band edge higher than that of a semiconductor B. Also, the top of the VB of the component A displays a lower value than the top edge of the valence band of the semiconductor B. Under this configuration, the hole-electron pairs photogenerated in the semiconductor B migrate to the semiconductor A which acts as a recombination center of these charge carriers. In this way, the heterojunction type I commonly exhibits a poor photocatalytic performance. For a type-II heterojunction, the bottom edge of the conduction band of the semiconductor A is more negative than the bottom of the CB of the semiconductor B. On the other hand, the top edge of the VB of the semiconductor B has a more positive potential than the valence band of the semiconductor A. These differences in the edge potentials are the driving force to provide the efficient transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers between bothsemiconductors, which reduces their recombination and, therefore, increases the photocatalytic behavior of the coupled system.
