However, the use of vaccination for the control of BRD in animals on arrival to feed-lots is still controversial (Ellis, 2001) and only occasionally used in Europe and very seldom used in Portugal (personal observations). The economic benefit of vaccination against BRD is not fully demonstrated (Smith et al., 1996) although there are some important factors (e.g. animal welfare) that are not considered in many of these studies (Tizard, 2000) . Most vaccine trials are conducted under controlled conditions or followed by experimental infection. Field studies, on the contrary, are still scarce (Engelken, 1997) .",

Other viruses that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of BRD include coronavirus, adenovirus, parvovirus and rhinovirus (Storz et al., 2002; Smith et al., 1996) . All of these viruses are known to be involved in BRD solely or in synergism with each other and bacteria. Some affect the lung parenchyma directly (BRSV and PI 3 ), while others act on the immune system (BVD and BRSV) or local defences (IBR), like the ciliated epithelium. The characteristics and role of these viruses in the pathogenesis of BRD are well documented (Ellis, 2001; Baker et al., 1997; Smith et al., 1996; Thomson, 1993) . However, in the field, it is usually difficult to identify the virus or viruses implicated in an outbreak of BRD especially in the feed-lot conditions.
