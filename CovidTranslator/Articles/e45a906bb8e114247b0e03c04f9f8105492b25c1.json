The ACA was the test of choice for the detection of IgM and lgA anti-rotavirus antibodies. The isotype specificity of these tests relies on the specificity of the MCAs and was confirmed for each test by the observation that samples containing rotavirus antibodies of only 1 particular isotype reacted only in the homologous assay. The MCAs against bovine Ig isotypes and isotype-specific EL1SAs were found to be very useful in the study of humoral mucosal immunity in calves infected with rotavirus. * Where appropriate the word 'isotype' includes subclasses lgG 1 and lgG 2.",

For the intestinal mucosa, these antibodies may be passively acquired through colostrum and milk or locally produced by elements of the mucosal immune system. Also, transudation of serum immunoglobulins can occur. In most species, immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the major immunoglobulin in milk and mucosal secretions (Tomasi and Zigelbaum, 1963; Heremans, 1974) . However, in ruminants, the predominating role of IgA in secretions is under question since IgG 1 seems to be the most abundant immuno-globulin in milk and intestinal secretions. Furthermore it appears to be (partly) serum derived (Newby and Bourne, 1976; Morgan et al., 1981; Newby et al,, 1982) .",

            "text": "To study the mucosal immune system of ruminants and especially the intestinal defence against enteric infections such as rotavirus induced enteritis, isotype *specific ELISAs for the detection of antibodies against a specific pathogen are very useful. They are sensitive and capable of handling large numbers of samples. In addition, the samples need not to be separated into their constituent lg isotypes. Obviously, the reliability of these tests depends largely upon their isotype specificity. which has to be demonstrated for each reagent and each test. This means that isotype specificity should be checked in the test under study or a similar test with the same sensitivity and that it is not sufficient to check specificity of antisera in less sensitive tests, such as immunodiffusion or immunoelectrophoresis. For instance, m earlier experiments with conventional antisera against bovine lg (Big) isotypes, we observed marked cross-reactions in ELISAs although the antisera appeared to be monospecific in immunodiffusion tests (see also Sloan and Butler, 1978: Townsend et al., 1982) . An inherent problem in isotype-specific ELISAs is the competition that occurs. This rnay be between isotypes (inter-isotype competition), when anti-lg isotype-specific reagents are used as conjugate, or within an isotype (intra-isotype competition) when anti-lg isotype-specific reagents are used as the capturing antibodies (Chantler and Diment, 1981) . Thus, in the former case a (weak) IgA or igM response may be missed due to the presence of competing IgG. In the latter case samples containing equal amounts of specific antibody of a particular isotype may yield different results in ELISAs if the ratio of the specific antibody to the total amount of this isotype differs in these samples. The extent of inter-isotype competition appears to be influenced by antibody concentration and affinity and to vary with the antigen under study (Filice et al., 1980; Townsend et al., 1982) .",

For later fusions we adopted the immunization schedule of St~thli et al. (1980) with repetitive high doses of antigen injected shortly before fusion. Subsequently, we obtained 40-100 positive clones from each fusion. Using this approach we recently obtained from 1 spleen over 1000 clones that produced antibody with the desired specificity for swine IgG (unpublished result). In Table I and Fig. 2 we present evidence that several of the MCAs obtained react monospecifically with IgG, IgG t, IgG 2 or IgA, while results with affinity-purified IgA prove that our anti-BIgM MCAs partially cross-react with lgA ( Figs. 2 and 3) . The reactivity of anti-BIgA MCAs with secretory component has not been studied yet. At present, we do not know whether the MCAs against IgM recognize different antigenic determi-nants.

Moreover, it is unlikely that they react with allotypic markers, since our MCAs react with several isotype preparations isolated from different animals and with Ig isotypes present in sera and fecal samples from several calves used in other studies (Van Zaane et al., submitted).

First, inter-isotype competition does not occur in the ACA. Second, interference with rheumatoid factors is very unlikely (Chantler and Diment, 1981) . Third, anti-Ig conjugates used in the IDAS, which will also react with non-specifically bound Ig from the test sample thus giving high backgrounds, are not used in the ACA. Our results however indicate that certain samples containing IgG~ or IgG 2 anti-rotavirus antibody were found negative or only weakly positive in the ACA (Table III) . We presume that intra-isotype competition in these samples (colostrum or feces containing unadsorbed colostral immunoglobulins) inhibited the detection of antigen-specific IgG~ and IgG 2. With serum samples, the ACA gave equal (IgGl) or better (IgG 2) results in comparison with the IDAS. Since it is not very practical to use different kinds of tests for different samples (serum, feces, colostrum, milk etc.) we decided to use the IDAS for detection of anti-rotavirus lgG~ and IgG 2. On the other hand, intra-isotype competition, although it can occur (Fig. 5) , did not interfere in the IgA and lgM ACA to the same extent as with IgG 1 and IgG 2 ( Table Ill) . This can be explained by the relatively short half-life of IgM and IgA (4.0 and 2.8 days respectively in comparison with 21 days for IgG (Logan et al., 1972) ) which leads to high percentages of antigen-specific antibody for these isotypes. Based on theoretical grounds and the experimental results the ACA was selected for the detection of IgM and IgA anti-rotavirus.",
