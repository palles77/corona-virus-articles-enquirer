When exposed to inactivated pseudorabiesvirus (iPRV), plasmacytoid but not myeloid DCs released IFN-\u2423 and IL-12. Remarkably, both iPRV-pulsed DC types were able to induce primary IFN-\u2425 producing T cells and IgG isotype switching in vivo. In contrast, tetanus toxoid pulsed DCs did not induce detectable primary immune responses. The efficacy of antiviral T and B cell priming proved dependent on the recipient's genotype. We conclude that either plasmacytoid or myeloid DCs pulsed with inactivated virus suffice to induce primary Th1-polarised immune responses.",

Murine plasmacytoid DCs descending from lymphoid precursors express CD11c and CD8\u2423, but not CD11b and are thought to stimulate the differentiation of T helper (Th)-1 cells by the production of IL-12.

            "text": "Which DC subsets become activated by non-replicating virion structures, and whether these suffice to enable prim-ing of naive T cells is largely unknown [6] . Acute viral infections typically evoke Th-1 type immune reactions, which are characterised by high interferon (IFN)-\u2425 production essential for virus-specific IgG2a responses [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Our studies are aimed at identifying critical factors that guide the host's antiviral immune reactions. To our surprise, the Th-1 polarized immune responses, typical for acute \u2423-herpesvirus and coronavirus infections, failed to default to a Th-2 profile despite the functional absence of p40 dependent interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, as well as IFN-\u2423/\u2424 or IFN-\u2425 [13, 14] , as has been tested in gene-deleted mice. Later, others noted an IL-12 independent Th-1 development in respiratory Sendai, adenovirus and influenza virus infection [8] [9] [10] , and in systemic murine cytomegalovirus [11] vesicular stomatitis and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections [12] . Although several reports state that type 1 interferons do play a role in the development of IFN-\u2425 producing Th cells [15] , both live and killed viruses can induce Th-1 responses in IFN-\u2423/\u2424-receptor deficient mice [16] . In general, the role of IFN-\u2423/\u2424, which is produced in high amounts upon virus infection by plasmacytoid DC precursors in Th cell polarization remains disputable.",

In addition, we studied the capacity of virion-exposed adoptively transferred DCs to generate antiviral IFN-\u2425-producing cells and IgG2a class switching by B cells. Our data show that early interactions between plasmacytoid/myeloid DCs and non-replicating virions are apparently sufficient to initiate T and B cells responses conditioned towards the Th-1 phenotype. Th-1 polarization is independent of the DC type transferred, and of its capacity to produce IL-12 and IFN-\u2423 in vitro. However, the genotype of the recipient may affect the overall efficacy of DC vaccination. Our data are relevant for prophylactic and therapeutic DC-based vaccination regimes.",

After 24 h exposure to iPRV or live PRV, culture media of in vitro incubated DCs were examined for cytokine production. As shown in Fig. 1 , plasmacytoid DCs (CD11c + CD11b \u2212 ), but not myeloid DCs (CD11c + CD11b + ), responded with high IL-12p40 production following stimulation with iPRV, and to a lesser extend with live PRV (p = 0.0024, Fig. 4A and B). We analysed the expression of the IL-12p40 subunit as a marker for IL-12p70 production. In cell culture supernatants of unstimulated DCs relatively low amounts of IL-12p40 were found. Similarly, IFN-\u2423 was produced by plasmacytoid DCs, but not by myeloid DCs (Fig. 1C and D) , which is in line with their plasmacytoid phenotype [19] . Both live attenuated and iPRV induce comparable amounts of this cytokine; indicating that replication of the virion is not required for this DC response. Exposure of both DC subtypes to tetanus toxoid (TT), a prototypic non-viral antigen, evoked no IL-12 nor IFN-\u2423/\u2424 production (data not shown).

We assume that early after inoculation \u2423 herpesvirions are internalised and processed by DCs resulting in subsequent presentation to naive helper cells. Likely, only a limited, undefined, fraction of viral antigens is taken up by the in vitro-exposed DCs and apparently sufficient to evoke primary adaptive responses, in contrast to the TT antigen. In general, little is known about the most up-stream molecular interactions leading to DC activation by viral structures. Although several pattern recognition receptors (PRR) for virus-specific structures have been described, their exact role in the induction of innate and subsequent acquired antiviral immune responses still has to be revealed [25, 26] . Virus-related pathogen-associated molecular structures that have been defined, such as for the fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus and for the hepatitis C virus core protein, are both involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 dependent responses [27] [28] [29] . Also more general motifs associated with virus particles and infection are thought to be recognized; TLR9 and TLR3 bind double stranded DNA and RNA, respectively [30] . Besides, members of the C-type lectin family can ligate virus-specific carbohydrate patterns, leading to maturation and antigen presentation by the DC [31] . However, how exactly iPRV activates DCs to provide presumed costimulatory signals to helper T cells is unknown. Remarkably, the particulate form of the virions and their highly organized structure seemed to contribute to in vitro DC activation [32] . We observed 26-63% lower cytokine levels produced upon stimulation with sodium deoxycholate (NaDOC) disrupted virus particles (data not shown). The influence of the antigenic structure on in vitro immune stimulation has been described before for influenza virus. Whole inactivated influenza virus led to functional DC maturation, which proved moderate following exposure to subunit antigens lacking the core protein [33] .",

            "text": "Primary B cell activation requires recognition of native antigen. One may question how vaccination with extensively washed DCs, pulsed overnight with iPRV, enables B cell IgG responses in naive recipients. Wykes and co-workers showed that in vitro addition of free antigen to B cells cultures results in secretion of only IgM, when help from antigen-specific T cells is provided, while B cells precultured in direct contact with Ag-pulsed DCs readily produce both IgM and IgG [34] . It is well recognised that DCs are able to retain model antigens such as horse radish peroxidase (HRP), KLH and human serum albumin in their native form for at least 24 h [34] . For immunisation with Ag-pulsed DCs this appears long enough to migrate to lymph nodes and to provide antigen plus contact-dependent signals essential for IgG class switching. This process, however, remains dependent on additional T cell help [34] . In contrast, IgM induction by iPRV is T cell independent (De Wit, unpublished observations). How exactly DCs expose B cells to antigens remains elusive; we may exclude a cany over effect after extensive washings. Hence, DCs not only initiate T helper activity but also directly initiate and influence antibody synthesis by B cells [34] [35] [36] . We assume that similar processes take place in the iPRV system.",

            "text": "Moser and colleagues have shown that the type of Agpulsed APC used for adoptive transfer immunisation may affect the subclass of antibody produced. [35] ; DCs pulsed with human \u2425 globuline (HHG) stimulated Th-1 priming, while HGG-pulsed macrophages appeared to prime Th-2 development and production of IgG1 and IgE antibodies, but only after a booster was given to the mice after the DC transfer [5, 37] . One paradigm advocates that lymphoid DCs initiate Th-1 differentiation, while myeloid DCs preferentially stimulate Th-2 development [4, 5, 38] . Especially, plasmacytoid murine DCs produce large amounts of IFN-\u2423 in response to irradiated HSV, while myeloid DCs fail to produce IFN-\u2423 following recognition of irradiated HSV [19] . This is in line with our iPRV data, for DCs derived from both 129/Sv mice and C57BL/6. Non-plasmacytoid DCs can produce IFN-\u2423 if dsRNA is able to access the cytosol [6] . Myeloid DCs from 129/Sv and C57/BL6 mice showed different IL-12 producing capability. iPRV induces IL-12 in both, plasmacytoid and remarkably myeloid DCs of C57BL/6 origin, while only plasmacytoid DCs from 129/SV mice produced IL-12. The fact that the iPRV preparation contained more virions may explain some of the quantitative differences observed in the production of IL-12. Since the function of the two DC subtypes is thought to be reflected in the expression of different sets of PRR [30, 39] , we speculate that either both DC subsets recognize distinct viral structures, or that both DC types recognize common viral patterns, whose receptors have yet to be revealed. Importantly, our data show that regardless of the recognition process both plasmacytoid and myeloid DC subtypes are able to evoke similar serum IgG isotype patterns, consistent with expansion of IFN-\u2425 producing Th-1 cells. Thus, we conclude that the antigen rather than the nature of DCs dictates the type of antiviral immune responses. Moreover, DC activation in our system is independent of viral replication, implicating that recognition of the virus particle itself is sufficient to initiate and skew downstream adaptive responses.",

However, since these DCs, similar to the high IL-12 producing lymphoid DCs, equally induced Th-1 differentiation following adoptive transfer, we conclude that IL-12 is not a major factor for Th-1 development evoked by iPRV. Also the virus-induced levels of in vitro IFN-\u2423 production by DCs, high in plasmacytoid cultures but minimal or absent in myeloid cultures, could not be linked to in vivo Th-1 development and associated IgG class switching. These findings are consistent with our earlier reports, using relevant gene-targeted mice, showing that IL-12, IL-23, IFN-\u2425 and IFN-\u2423/\u2424 independent type 1 immune responses occur following live virus infections or direct immunisation with inactivated viruses in absence of exogenous vaccine adjuvant [13, 14, 16] . Interestingly, IL-12 independent type-1 immunity was observed for other viral infections [8, 9, 11, 12] . These data observed in mice largely fit with observations in patients carrying mutations in the IL-12 p40 or the IL-12 receptorpi gene, who respond normally to viral vaccines, but have difficulties to control Salmonella and mycobacterial infections [41] .",
