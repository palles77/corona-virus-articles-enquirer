For example, it has been reported that students have contact with fewer people at weekends [3] and that the number of contacts children have with others approximately halves during the holidays [4, 5] . Several studies have also examined illness transmission rates during planned school closures, reporting a reduction in illness during school holidays [6, 7, 8 ] and teacher strikes [9] .",

The key variation in these number of absolute contacts are social and cultural differences but also technical definitions of what a contact is (such as physical contact or transitory contact).Complicating matters is that the qualitative nature of contacts also changes. Many studies have explored what types of activities children engage in outside of the home during a closure. These include the full range of recreational and social activities, from shopping to meeting friends indoors, using public transport and visiting restaurants. It is likely that the type of activity is important in determining the likelihood of infection spreading. For example, participation in sports events have been noted to be particularly associated with the spread of influenza as have social events such as parties, whereas we can, perhaps, be less concerned about visits to a park[19]. Further research is needed on quantifying the rates of contact associated with the various different activities reported in this review; contacts in households, schools and workplaces are likely for a more sustained duration than in more transient social settings (such as shopping) but parties may form a middle ground. Assuming infection given a contact is a function of duration and type of contact, this can form the basis of more evidence-based modelling and risk assessment.",
