Results We immobilized Ulp1 on N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated Sepharose with a coupling efficiency of 1.7 mg/ml. The immobilized Ulp1 maintains 95% substrate-cleavage ability and significantly enhances pH and thermal stability, especially can withstand pH of 10.5. Besides resistance against some small molecules, the immobilized Ulp1 can tolerate 15% (v/v) DMSO and 20% (v/v) ethanol. It can be reused for more than 15 batch reactions with 90% activity retention. This provides a fast purification system to quickly obtain cleaved recombinant proteins with 95% purity from cell lysates with the application of immobilized Ulp1.",

However, no matter if the fusion tags are large or small, they will possibly interfere with the structure or normal functions of the fused proteins (Horchani et al. 2009 ). Therefore, protein tags sometimes need to be removed by chemical agents, proteases or possibly self-splicing intein. For example, ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) have been expressed with SUMO fusion technology and purified with Ni-NTA but the SUMO-tag needs to be cleaved for further NMR studies (Rutkowska et al. 2009 ).",

As for the free Ulp1, its activity was sharply decreased with DMSO up to 5% (v/v). We also examined the influence of ethanol (Fig. 2b) and found both free and immobilized Ulp1 work well when ethanol was up to 20% (v/v). Stability in these solvents indicates that DMSO or ethanol can be added to minimize bacterial growth and be useful for some catalyzing and modification reactions (Yang et al. 2014 ). Interestingly, SUMO was degraded when no DMSO was added while no perspective degradation existed after 10% DMSO was added ( Supplementary  Fig. 2) . Therefore, presumably the existence of DMSO prevented the degradation of cleaved SUMO. Both free and immobilized Ulp1 are resistant to some small molecules such as NaCl, imidazole, DTT and urea ( Supplementary Fig. 3a-d) .

Figure 3a shows that the free Ulp1 lost about 84% of activity after 24 h at 37\u00b0C. However, the immobilized Ulp1 retained 96% of activity even after 36 h. With storage at 25\u00b0C free Ulp1 maintained about 50% of its initial activity over 7 days (data not shown) but lost 77% of its activity after 14 days, whereas only 7% decreasing of activity for the immobilized Ulp1 within the same period (Fig. 3b) . Immobilized Ulp1 also showed good stability at 4 and 30\u00b0C (Fig. 3b,  Supplementary Fig. 4) . Unexpectedly, cleaved SUMO (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 4 ) was degraded which is consistent to the speculation that DMSO will prevent degradation of cleaved SUMO. The cleavage efficiency of Ulp1 usually increases with the increase of temperature, the optimum temperature is generally 25-37\u00b0C, and increasing hydrolysis time can reduce the cost of Ulp1. Ulp1 used in its immobilized form has greatly enhanced thermal stability and can be utilized in rapid cleavage and industrial applications (Kokufuta 1992) .",
