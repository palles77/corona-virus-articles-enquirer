Not only the H1N1 (95%) subtype but also several H3N2 (5%) subtype influenza viruses have been detected in samples. According to Chinese national influenza data ( http: //ivdc.chinacdc.cn/ ), the H1N1 subtype influenza virus was prevalent from the end of 2018 to the beginning of 2019. The H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of influenza virus are resistant to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine), and a small number of H1N1 strains have been found to be less sensitive to NA inhibitors (NAIs; oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir). In this study, we briefly evaluated the evolution patterns of the H1N1 influenza virus and the H3N2 influenza virus.",

The haplotype network map shows that the 2014 H1N1 strain has a node in common with the 2016/17 H3N2 strain ( Fig. 1 ) , and H1N1 and H3N2 often co-infect the same patients. When multiple strains of influenza infect the same host, they may undergo recombination and reassortment of the gene fragment, which greatly changes the pathogenicity and epidemiological characteristics of the virus. Currently, the H1N1 subtype influenza virus is widespread in the population, and the number of children with neurological symptoms increased significantly this year. 3 The influenza virus has shown some variation, and whether this variation occurs along H1N1 and H3N2 lines remains to be seen. When multiple viruses co-infection occurs, it becomes possible for the viruses to undergo genetic communication, which may change the direction of viral evolution and so deserves our attention.",

It can be seen that the genetic evolution rate of the H1N1 influenza virus and the H3N2 influenza virus is 2.91E \u22125 -4.03E \u22124 and 2.72E \u22125 -1.05E \u22124 ( Table 1 ) , respectively, in the same year and there are up and down fluctuations that may be related to the subtypes that were prevalent that year. Additionally, we calculated the evolution rate of the H1N1 influenza virus from the end of 2018 to the beginning of 2019 (1.13E \u22123 ). A large increase in the rate of advancement indicates a rapid change in the virus in the short term, triggering changes in the replication, resistance, and transmission of the virus. The type A influenza virus emerges periodically every year,Influenza undergoes continuous evolution, and different lineages have appeared. 4 At the same time, under the action of vaccines and drugs, the antigenicity and antigenic site of the virus are transformed and resistant. 5 However, medical science has also improved. It is necessary to determine the frequency of gene exchange between different subtypes and be alert to possible variations in gene communication between different subtypes. Pu et al. 6 and Shi et al. 7 reported that duck-derived virus H7NX and recombination of H7N9 can produce new H7N2 that can cause disease death in waterfowl. This recombination event may have occurred in 2013 or earlier, but the recombinant virus has a distinct evolutionary advantage given the use of a vaccine. Exchange between H1N1 and H3N2 may allow them to give each other different viral characteristics, Hence, ongoing surveillance of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of influenza is warranted. ",

Thus, we collected all available H7N9 sequences to detect potential novel reassortments of the H7N9 AIVs, and found evidences that three human-isolated H7N9 isolates attained internal genes from duck and human AIVs.",

Reassortments between human and avian AIVs can make the reassortant viruses replicate efficiently in mammalian hosts. 8 It's very possible that the reassortment between H7N9 and human H3N2, may make the reassortant virus more adaptive to human, even attain the ability to efficiently transmit between humans, and thus raise great thread to the public health. Historically, several pandemic human influenza viruses were derived from reassortant virus between avian and human influenza viruses. For example, the H1N1/pdm2009 virus, which was a swine reassortant virus that attained the PB1 from human H3N2, was rapidly transmitted between humans and then, globally circulates as a seasonal virus, posing a substantial risk to human. 9 H7N9 AIVs have the genetic makeup associated with human infections, 10 in addition to our finding that the reassortant human-isolated H7N9 virus attained the PB1 and PB2 from human H3N2, possibility like the H1N1/pdm2009 virus, the reassortant virus would become more invasive to humans, and thus pose serious pandemic threat to humans.",

He was present within a distance of 1 metre for more than 5 h. There was apparently no direct contact between them, except that same HCW served both of them sharing non-critical medical devices. After recovery, Case -23 was discharged from THB, to return after a week to GMCK with high grade fever, developing encephalopathy and respiratory distress, diagnosed to have NiV infection and succumbed to it. In the current outbreak, 3 family members, one staff nurse, one trainee nurse, one radiology assistant who took care of the index case and 13 hospital contacts contracted the infection, proving human-to-human transmission. Respiratory aerosols and fomites cause human-to-human spread. 3 The mortality rate, in all recent NiV outbreaks in the Indian subcontinent is 75-100% with the Bangladeshi strain 3 (NiV-B) and its close relative in the recent Kerala outbreak, 2 has been consistently almost double compared to Ebola. Further that Case -23 getting infected from Case-10 in the same premises of THB, makes our case for rPEP stronger. The 2 survivors out of 23 infected patients in this outbreak have also received ribavirin. 9 Given the recent findings of widespread presence of NiV among Pteropus bats in India, 10 another outbreak might be just a matter of time. Our field notes from emergency, voluntary, off-label rPEP among HCW provides evidence, albeit low-quality, of its safety and probable efficacy, strongly suggesting a pre-planned trial for PEP to be started immediately once such an explosive outbreak of NiV is notified.",

This makes it necessary for our frontline medical staff to be aware of the potential risks from rabies and simian herpes B virus (SHBV or Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 -CeHV-1) associated with this type of exposure. 2 Although infections are rare as a consequence of bites, 3,4 both viruses can result in very high (80-100%) mortality if the appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis is not initiated promptly. In view of these serious consequences, post-exposure protocols have been developed to reduce likelihood of infection. 2 , 5-7 While this is agreed for rabies, 5, 8 post-exposure prophylaxis is not uniformly recommended for SHBV, as cases have only been reported with captive monkeys, 3,9 despite numerous monkey bite exposures in regions where animals are thought to be infected. Assessing risks versus benefits obviously needs to be done judiciously in each case, and national public health specialists can be consulted to support decision making. 8, 9 The main risk is primarily from monkey bites from macaque monkeys (genus Macaca ), which are now encountered relatively frequently in various tourist areas in Southeast Asia (e.g. Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand).",

The bite wounds healed without sequelae. At her 18-day clinic review once back in the UK, she was still asymptomatic. Baseline saliva and blood samples were taken and stored but not tested for SHBV. She continued both the SHBV and rabies PEP whilst continuing her travels a week later, and remained asymptomatic six weeks post-exposure.",

            "text": "Although cases have been reported in various regions, there are significant differences ( P < 0.001) in the distribution of dengue among the different cities in the Guangdong Province ( Fig. 2 ) . Incident cases were mainly concentrated in Guangzhou City and Foshan City. Guangzhou City had a total of 40,170 cases during 2008-2017, which accounted for 76.09% of cases among the different cities. Foshan City had a total of 4660 cases, which accounted for 8.83% of cases. However, according to annual data trends, 2014 was the turning point in spatial distribution patterns for dengue fever. From 2008-2013, the incidence of dengue was concentrated in Foshan City, Guangzhou City, Jiangmen City, and Zhongshan City (93.14% of cases). However, by 2014, except for Meizhou City, there were case reports from all 20 cities in the province. Among them, there were 13 cities with more than 200 cases each. After 2014, dengue fever was prevalent throughout the province. Even in Zhanjiang City, Zhaoqing City and Jieyang City, which are distant from Guangzhou City, and the number of cases in remote areas increased significantly. This paper is the first to analyze the characteristics of the change in dengue epidemics in Guangdong Province in the past 10 years. In general, the incidence of dengue fever has typical spatial differences. The cases were mainly concentrated in urban areas with large populations and developed economies, such as Guangzhou City and Foshan City. Theinflux of many migrants, especially those from Southeast Asia, could have caused the higher incidence of dengue fever in these areas. Studies have shown that dengue epidemics in China were initiated by imported cases and then became prevalent in the local areas 6 . However, attention should be given to the large number of dengue epidemics in remote areas, which appeared after 2014. A possible reason for this could be global climate warming, which has caused the natural environments in some remote areas to become suitable for mosquito breeding. Moreover, rapid development in tourism and trade has also led to an increase in local and imported cases. In summary, after 2014, the epidemic characteristics of dengue fever in Guangdong Province have undergone major changes. The key areas for prevention and control are no longer confined to traditional epidemic areas, such as Guangzhou City and Foshan City. Instead, dengue prevention and control should be conducted throughout the province. In addition, according to the national dengue surveillance in 2018, dengue fever has shown a trend of \"moving up north\" in the country 7 . Therefore, the changing characteristics of this epidemic warrant high attention of relevant departments.",
