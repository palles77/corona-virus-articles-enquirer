The probe (AgNCs/G) utilized for HIV-1 detection adopted an effective conformation based on enhancement effect of G-rich sequence (at 500 nm ex / 565 nm em) while the probe (AgNCs/AgNCs) for HIV-2 generated fluorescence signals (at 580 nm ex / 630 nm em) with bright fluorescence only in nanoclusters dimer. The nanoprobe shows high selectivity for multiplexed analysis of target DNA with a detection limit of 11 pM, respectively.

Among these methods, the fluorescence method is widely used because of its simple operation, high sensitivity and intuitive observation. For example, Zhang et al. [18] reported a single QD-based biosensor for simultaneous detection of two HIV DNAs, with obviously low sample consumption, highly sensitive, and short detection time. But this work must use fluorescent markers. Lu et al. [19] developed a QD-based nanosensor for simultaneously detecting two HIV DNAs, which has high sensitivity, selectivity and the PS-QD composite used in this work has long storage time and simple storage conditions. However, the composite materials required for this method are difficult to prepare. And several time ago, our team developed a functional three helix molecular beacon fluorescent \"turn-on\" probe for simultaneously detect HIV-1 and HIV-2, which has many advantages such as simplicity, low-cost, and high immunity to interference [20] . But this proposed strategy exists the problem of complex probe design. To address the issues mentioned above, silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) was introduced which possess significant advantages of label-free, facile synthesis and simple probe-preparation and the fluorescence emission bands can be tuned throughout the visible and near-IR range simply by changing the sequence of the oligonucleotide [21, 22] . AgNCs are used to detect single HIV DNA in fluorescence methods [23, 24] , but as far as we know, there is no report about a DNA-programming multicolor silver nanoclusters for simultaneous detection of two HIV DNAs.",

The sensing platform was established based on fluorescence enhancement of guanine (G)-rich [25, 26] and the phenomenon in the process of two silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) forming a nanoclusters dimer [27, 28] . The maximum emission peak of green-emitting AgNCs is 565 nm, while the maximum emission peak of orange-emitting AgNCs is 630 nm. The sensing platform includes two steps: 1) before addition to HIV DNAs, the AgNCs at one end is lighted up by G-rich sequence and the AgNCs at the other end enhanced rely on squeezing each other between two AgNCs. 2) After addition to HIV DNAs, the conjugate pairs structure are destroyed by hybridization between probe and HIV DNAs while fluorescence reduction because of separating AgNCs from enhanced auxiliaries. This is the first time that silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) have been used for simultaneously detecting two HIV DNAs. And compared to the singletarget assay, multiplex assay allows for the screening of multiple analytes in a single detection with the obvious benefit of simplicity, speed, low sample and reagent consumption. Thus, the fluorescent probes of only single polychromatic AgNCs-based can provide an alternative platform for further application in biocompatible, environmentfriendly, highly sensitive and high selectivity analysis of multiple target DNA. The method provides a clever design concept for simultaneously detecting HIV-1 and HIV-2 with advantages of low consumption and simple operation.",

The luminescent AgNCs with 565 nm and 630 nm emission peaks were used as templates to simultaneously detecting of HIV-1 and HIV-2. Due to the different cytosine (C)-rich sequences, the two colors of AgNCs at emission of 565 nm and 630 nm could be formed exactly at the position of \"CCC ACC CAC CCA CCC\" and \"CCC TAA CTC CCC\" of the P sequence [27, 29] . HIV-1 was detected using green fluorescent AgNCs with a maximum emission wavelength of 565 nm, and HIV-2 was detected using orange fluorescent AgNCs with a maximum emission wavelength of 630 nm. After the addition of the target HIV-1, the green strong fluorescence on one side was quenched by the separation of AgNCs from the G-rich sequence; likewise, the strong orange fluorescence on the other side after the addition of HIV-2 was attenuated due to the separation of the two AgNCs. When the target HIV-1 and HIV-2 were present, the structure of the high fluorescence effect was destroyed and the both color fluorescence signals were lowered. The simultaneous detection based on two phenomena of fluorescence enhancement of guanine (G)-rich and two silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) forming a nanoclusters dimer. The possibility of the fluorescence enhancement of guanine (G)-rich is caused by electron transfer from guanines to the nanoclusters, and the two silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) forming a nanoclusters dimer is due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Fig. 1a and b depicted the characteristic fluorescence spectra of green fluorescent AgNCs and orange-emitting AgNCs at the same environment in the presence of two HIV DNAs (500.0 nM, respectively). The two graphs demonstrate the feasibility of testing HIV-1 and HIV-2 (500.0 nM, respectively), with fluorescence at 565 nm and 630 nm decreasing significantly in the presence of two targets over time.",

From the Fig. 2a and b, we can see that the probe exhibits characteristic absorption peaks at 500 nm and 575 nm after Ag + and reducing agent NaBH 4 are added respectively. The two absorption peaks correspond to the emission wavelengths of 565 nm and 630 nm, respectively. After the target was added, because the target competed with the complementary DNA sequence, the strong fluorescence state of the silver clusters at both ends was destroyed, and no UV absorption peak was observed. As shown in Fig. S3 , when P or cDNA in the solution alone, there was two same bands appeared in the same level (lanes 1, 2). When they hybridized and formed dsDNA, a band appeared in lane 3. When the probe was used to detect HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively, two bright bands appeared (lanes 4, 5) at the same position, indicating that the hybridization between probe and target DNA opened the mismatched double-stranded structure, resulting in a weak fluorescent signal. The band of lane 6 indicated that when the probe was used to simultaneously detect of HIV-1 and HIV-2, the mismatched double-stranded structure was fully opened, forming P/HIV-1 and cDNA/HIV-2 duplexs, while the fluorescence intensity was lowered.

As Fig. 3 were showed, When HIV-1 (500.0 nM) and HIV-2 (500.0 nM) were added, the complementary strand is competed to hybridize to the corresponding target DNA, respectively. The non-interference analysis of HIV-1 and HIV-2 was confirmed by the green fluorescent AgNCs and the orange fluorescent AgNCs. As Fig. 3 were showed, both AgNCs showed very strong fluorescence in the absence of HIV-1 and HIV-2. Low emission occurs at 565 nm only in the presence of HIV-1, but does not affect the maximum emission intensity of orange fluorescent AgNCs. Identically, HIV-2 alone resulted in low emission at 630 nm, while the emission of green light-emitting AgNCs was highest (Fig. 3b, c) . When both target DNAs were added at the same time, the low fluorescence intensity at the maximum emission peaks of 565 nm and 630 nm was obtained (Fig. 3d) , indicating that multiple HIV DNAs were successfully detected and would not interfere with each other. In addition, compared with other methods, we designed a sensing strategy that does not require any labeling.

Importantly, this method is performed in solution, which makes in situ and real-time analysis easy. In addition, DNA stabilized AgNCs provide an effective way for the detection of various analytes due to their ease of preparation and large range of emission.
