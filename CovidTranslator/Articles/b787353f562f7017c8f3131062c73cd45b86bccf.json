According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO), by 14 th Mar., 2020 a total of 142,539 cases have been reported in 136 countries and territories, and 9,769 new cases were reported on the single day of 14 th Mar. [1] Italy, Iran, and South Korea aside China have the highest number of confirmed cases (17,660; 11,364; 8086) as of 14 th Mar., 2020. [1] In response, highly affected countries have adopted innovative curbing interventions such as whole city lockdowns, the establishment of drive-through screening centers and banning large social gatherings amongst others to locally contain the virus and prevent further new cases. [2, 3] Affected and unaffected countries following WHO guidelines are developing or have commenced implementation of country-specific prevention, early case detection as well as quarantine and treatment policies. [4] Some countries have closed borders and/or suspended flight commutation with major affected countries including South Korea and Iran regardless of the WHO cautions. [5, 6] Such drastic measures are very essential in the pandemic control, but may also negatively affect the global economy if maintained over a longer duration as countries like China and South Korea contribute largely to global industrial production and provision of goods and services. [7, 8] Although some low-middle income countries (LMICs) in Africa remained unaffected for a while, 15 African countries and territories have reported a total of 73 confirmed cases as of 14 th Mar., 2020. [1] This furthers concerns of a pandemic as under-resourced LMICs in the region lack adequate infrastructures to successfully contain a breakout and are dependent on .

South Korea was the first country outside of China that reported over 1000 cases on 26 th Feb, but the number of its total confirmed cases was then surpassed by Italy, which became the first country with confirmed cases exceeded 10,000 on 11 th Mar. Six countries (Korea, France, Spain, Germany, United States, and Switzerland) had reported over 1,000 cases, among which four were European countries. Especially, the areas surrounding Italy has become a new big epicenter, in where the number of newly confirmed cases increases very rapid. More and more countries had reported over 10 or 100 cases during the second increasing period, although countries with less than 10 cases remained the majority. The fast increase of infected countries and confirmed cases demonstrate a widespread of COVID-19 globally and the occurrence of epidemics in regions outside of China.",

Second, the global situation is more complicated than that of China, and it is hard to take as the same level of action as China did. The global COVID-19 epidemic is under the impact of available of medical resources, religion, political, economic and other comprehensive reasons, and as these vary from country by country, a \"one-to-all\" strategy may not suit all. Thus, tailored strategies are another tsunami which will further worsen the pandemic.

[13] Our study indicated that local transmission has been established in more than 50% of the countries that reported cases of COVID-19. The establishment of local transmission and the increase in the number of epidemic centers indicates a widespread and that a sustained transmission of COVID-19 has been established globally, and therefore, the war against COVID-19 may have changed from an emerging response to a long-term war.

The number of new cases accelerated for 15 days in China and gradually decreased after 6 th Feb., except for 12 th Feb (the diagnosis criteria changed by including clinically diagnosed cases, to facilitate treatment). The acceleration of new cases in the world outside of China started from 24 th Feb. and lasted for 20 days, which was already longer than that in China. However, a decreasing trend in the number of new cases outside of China was not yet observed as at 14 th Mar., and thus this stage might last longer, while China already achieved this on 12 th Feb. A similar growing trend was observed for cumulative cases although more exaggerated in the world outside of China. The trend was gentle at the first stage (13 th Jan. -18 th Feb., slope = 18\u20275) with the number of cumulative cases slowly raising for about one month till it reached 804 on 18 th Feb. At the second stage (18 th -27 th Feb., slope = 278\u20273), the cumulative cases increased to 3,664 in ten days and rapidly grew to 14,768 in about one week at the third stage (27 th Feb. -5 th Mar., slope = 1549\u20270). The rapid increase continued to accelerate at the fourth stage (5 th -11 th Mar., slope = 3756\u20272) and the fifth stage (11 th -14 th Mar., slope = 8122\u20276). The cumulative cases had more than doubled in only one week and reached 37,371 as at 11 th Mar. at the fourth stage and climbed to 61,518 on 14 th Mar. at the fifth stage.

During this period, most of the countries in Latin America were affected by COVID-19, with eight of them developed local transmission.

During the single-center period (13 th Jan. -20 th Feb.), the epidemics mainly occurred in China, which had 75,993 confirmed cases while other countries had around or less than 100 cases by 20 th Feb. Most affected countries were from Europe and the Western Pacific Region while no case was reported in South America within this period. During the multi-centers period (after 20 th Feb.), the number of new cases gradually decreased in China while rapidly increased in South Korea from 20 th Feb., in Iran from 22 nd Feb., and in Italy from 23 rd Feb. The disease also spread to many other countries and territories in Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean Region as well as the countries and territories in Africa and South America, which were the two continents with fewer infections in the single-center period. South Korea, Italy, and Iran became the new centers of the outbreak as of 8 th Mar, with Italy and Iran reporting over 10,000 cases and South Korea reporting over 8,000 cases.France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, and United States became minor centers of the epidemic with over 1,000 cases reported.DiscussionSustained human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 worldwide appears inevitable and understanding the real-time patterns of the epidemic would be useful for guiding further time-sensitive responses.
