The model is applied to Belgium, parameterized with country-specific data on social mixing and travel, and calibrated to the 2008/2009 influenza season. It includes behavioral changes occurring during weekend vs. weekday, and holiday vs. school-term. Several experimental scenarios are explored to identify the relevant social and behavioral mechanisms. Stochastic numerical simulations show that holidays considerably delay the peak of the season and mitigate its impact. Changes in mixing patterns are responsible for the observed effects, whereas changes in travel behavior do not alter the epidemic. Weekends are important in slowing down the season by periodically dampening transmission. Christmas holidays have the largest impact on the epidemic, however later school breaks may help in reducing the epidemic size, stressing the importance of considering the full calendar. An extension of the Christmas holiday of 1 week may further mitigate the epidemic. Changes in the way individuals establish contacts during holidays are the key ingredient explaining the mitigating effect of regular school closure. Our findings highlight the need to quantify these changes in different demographic and epidemic contexts in order to provide accurate and reliable evaluations of closure effectiveness. They also suggest strategic policies in the distribution of holiday periods to minimize the epidemic impact.",

They often have a larger vulnerability to infections because of limited prior immunity, and they mix at school with high contact rates [80] thus representing key drivers for influenza spread. The closure of school has been associated to the potential of reducing influenza propagation in the community by breaking important chains of transmission. It is expected to potentially delay the peak, and reduce the epidemic impact, at peak time and of the overall wave. Though not specifically recommended by the World Health Organization during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it is envisioned as a possible non-pharmaceutical intervention for pandemic mitigation left to the decision of national and local authorities [12, 98] .",

Benefits and limita-tions appear to depend on the specific epidemic context. For example, influenza epidemics characterized by a larger attack rate in children compared to adults are expected to be more sensitive to the closure of schools [24] . This experience was reported in many countries during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, where closed schools coincided with a marked reduction of influenza activity [71, 82, 25, 64, 99, 28, 29, 79, 42, 43, 4, 33, 65] . School closure interventions are often considered along with other mitigation strategies, as it happened with social distancing in Mexico following the pandemic outbreak [35, 28] , making their effect more difficult to isolate. Studies generally report a slowing down effect in the incidence during closure, however in some cases the effect may be mixed with the natural decline of the epidemic, because of late implementation [69] . In addition, no clear trend is observed in the impact of school closure on the epidemic burden depending on the time of closure -before, around, or after the peak [69] .",

            "text": "Given its potentially important role in reducing the epidemic impact, school closure has more often been investigated in the realm of pandemics compared to seasonal influenza [69] . For the latter, regular school closure during holidays in temperate regions has been considered as a natural example to evaluate the impact of school closure [62, 23, 52] . Directly extending the application to pandemic situations has however important limitations. Closure associated to winter holidays is regularly scheduled in the school calendar, whereas school closure as an intervention corresponds to an unplanned interruption of school attendance that may take different forms (e.g. proactive vs. reactive, at the national or local level, with a gradual closure of classes or of the entire school) [22, 53, 49, 30] . In addition to the different nature of closure, also its duration changes from a fixed scheduled period of holidays to one of variable extension depending on the ongoing epidemic and resulting outcome. How individual behavior changes in all these conditions is the critical aspect to quantify in order to accurately assess the impact of school closure on transmission.",

Applications to seasonal influenza may on the other hand count on a more accurate description of population mixing. Surveys conducted over the calendar year to measure variations of mixing patterns [61, 41, 40, 13] offer indeed the opportunity to perform data-driven modeling studies that mechanistically assess the role of school holidays on seasonal influenza.

Three modeling studies were developed so far with similar objectives. Towers and Chowell studied the impact of day-of-week variations in human social contact patterns on incidence data collected at a large hospital in Santiago, Chile, during 2009 H1N1pdm [90] . Their approach was not spatial, therefore did not consider mobility changes, and mainly focused on the sensitivity of influenza incidence variations to the latency period. Apolloni et al. used a stylized analytical approach to evaluate the role of age-dependent social mixing and travel behavior on the conditions for epidemic spatial invasion [4] . The model can compare different contexts, with or without schools in terms, and also account for associated changes. The contexts are however considered independently (no full school calendar can be considered) and the epidemic impact is evaluated only in terms of conditions for spatial dissemination. Going beyond these limitations, more recently Ewing et al. introduced an age-specific spatial metapopulation model to evaluate how behavioral changes associated to winter holiday impact the flu season [45] . The model is applied to the United States and it integrates data on travel behavior, whereas mixing is assumed from estimates available from Europe and adapted to summer holiday changes measured in the UK during the 2009 pandemic [39] . Their findings identify changes in mixing patterns as the key element responsible for the epidemic effects induced by holidays.",

The aim is to reduce assumptions in favor of input data, and to exclusively focus on seasonal influenza and associated parameterization. Contact data associated to four types of calendar days are considered, belonging to Regular Weekday, Regular Weekend, Holiday Weekday, Holiday Weekend (here 'regular' refers to non-holiday period), allowing us to assess the role of weekends in addition to holidays. A richer calendar with additional holidays beyond Christmas break is also considered. Confirming and extending prior results with a different modeling approach and input data would greatly support our understanding of the role of changes in mixing and travel on influenza epidemics.",

We parameterized it with influenza-like-illness (ILI) data reported by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health at the district level for the 2008/2009 season. By using the Belgian school calendar for that season, we assessed the impact of the individual changes in mixing and travel behavior during regular school closure, given by available data. We then tested experimental scenarios to identify the mechanisms responsible for the observed epidemic outcomes. Here, we describe in detail the mathematical model, input data, calibration procedure and experimental scenarios.",

It includes 589 patches corresponding to the 589 municipalities (nl. gemeenten, fr. communes) of Belgium.

Among all holiday periods, the largest effect is produced by the Christmas holiday, responsible for the overall reduction of the epidemic size and a peak delay of about 1 week. The early break of Fall holiday has negligible impact instead. Winter holiday leads to a very small reduction of the epidemic size (median of 1%), but no effect on the peak timing or peak incidence. The impact of Easter holiday is negligible on all indicators.

In specific mixing conditions -e.g. those of a holiday weekenda large fraction of patches has R p 1, indicating that those locations are found to be close to the critical conditions for epidemic extinction. Influenza is mainly sustained in patches having larger R p during those periods, and epidemic activity is then transferred to other patches through the mobility of infected individuals. Three-fourth of Belgian districts reach their epidemic peak in the simulations within one week of the empirical peak time. Districts exhibiting greater delays lie on the border of the country. This may be due to the model neglecting the mobility coupling between these regions and the neighboring countries, which is considerably large in some districts (e.g. the flux of individuals of the Luxembourg province commuting abroad represents almost 40% of the total flux of commuters of the district). Our study considered the country to be isolated for the sake of simplicity. We expect this border effect to be increasingly negligible for larger countries.",

Travel changes, on the other hand, do not act directly on the transmission potential but affect the coupling force between epidemics in different patches and the opportunity for individuals to be exposed to the disease. For this reason, changes in travel behavior have a smaller effect that is found to be negligible for influenza epidemic spread, as also observed in the work of [45] . This is also consistent with the large literature on travel restrictions showing the little or no effect that these interventions have on pandemic spatial spread [32, 63, 46, 31, 44, 11, 18, 7, 84] .

If the school break occurs earlier (as for the Fall holiday) or much later in the influenza season (e.g. Easter holiday), no effect is produced on the resulting epidemic. The case of Winter holidays occurring during the fadeout of the epidemic shows that a small reduction of the total number of cases can still be achieved with school closure after the epidemic peak, whereas other studies showed minimal impact [45] .",

By systematically exploring this interplay through synthetic scenarios, we confirm the importance of Christmas holiday in mitigating the influenza epidemic. Most importantly, we found that the break would have the largest impact for a very early season when school closing would occur at or around the epidemic peak. Reduction in transmission due to fewer contacts leads to a strong reduction of the incidence and ultimately of the total epidemic size, as also observed in pandemic settings [69] . In the other synthetic influenza seasons explored, a rebound effect was obtained when schools reopened after the break, most notably for the early season anticipating of two weeks the 2008/2009 influenza epidemic (-2w model). This was previously observed in other contexts [60, 48, 17, 8, 14, 62, 6, 35] , also when no additional interventions beyond school closure were considered [48, 62] . The various tested scenarios show that Christmas break would have a larger mitigating impact if it occurs before (or around) the peak and when the incidence is about half the peak value or larger.",

As such, we expect it could have a favorable impact on the epidemic outcome in the majority of influenza seasons. Previous work analyzing the length of school closure found that two weeks or more appear to be enough to result in a recognizable effect [48, 62, 23, 99, 6] , whereas shorter closures may not be beneficial or may not have an obvious impact [37, 34, 70, 86, 19] . Our synthetic results show that the extension would be advantageous only if implemented after the Christmas break, with a mitigation of the peak incidence and a minimal peak delay of a few days. Extensions are generally considered in the realm of reactive closures against a pandemic influenza.",

The straightforward extension of our conclusions to the pandemic case faces however several challenges. First, effects induced by school closure may be specific to the specific epidemic profile, and therefore they may lead to different results depending on the pandemic under consideration [22] . For example, beneficial effects of school closure during 2009 H1N1 pandemic may have resulted from the larger magnitude of children attack rates vs. adults. Epidemic contexts more homogeneously impacting age classes may be less affected by school closure. Second, the nature of the school closure may alter the behavior of individuals during that period. In our study we considered holidays that are regularly planned in the school calendar and associated to specific social activities (e.g. vacation trips, family visits and others), for which contact data are available [61] . School closure during an influenza pandemic may be envisioned as a proactive or reactive measure to the ongoing outbreak. Not being planned, it is expected to have a stronger disruptive impact on social mixing of individuals on the short term compared to regular closure. On the other hand, it is argued that prolonged closure may limit the reduction of contacts on the long term, because of costs and logistics, and reduction in compliance rate [23, 22] . Having shown here that changes in social mixing represent the single element critically responsible for the impact of school closure on the epidemic outcome, we note that modeling results on school closure in the case of a pandemic would strongly be affected by assumptions considered for mixing changes, in absence of data.",

Our work focused on Belgium, as a rather detailed survey was conducted in the country to estimate contact rates in the population of different age classes at different periods of the calendar year [61] . These estimates constituted the input data to parameterize our spatial modeling framework. Modeling approaches to study epidemics in settings where no data exist are often based on the assumption that mixing would reduce following school closure and import estimates available from other settings or epidemiological contexts [79, 49, 45] . This may lead to several issues. Contacts and their changes along the calendar may be country-specific [80] , thus affecting epidemic results when applied to a different context. Estimates of the overall reduction of the number of contacts during school closure vary widely. Transmission models fitted to epidemic data estimated reductions ranging from 16-18% for holidays during seasonal influenza in France [23] , to 25% in Hong Kong for proactive school closure during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [99] , to 30% for the social distancing interventions (including school closure) implemented in Mexico following the start of 2009 pandemic [28] . A large-scale population-based prospective survey in Europe estimated the changes in contact patterns for holiday versus regular period to correspond to a reduction in the reproductive number as high as 33% for some countries, whereas for others no significant decrease was observed [61] . Finally, such overall reduction does not allow to fully parametrize a contact matrix. Such evidence does not support the parameterization of mixing changes from different countries and/or epidemic situations (e.g. seasonal vs. pandemic) [45] . The reduction is expected to be heterogeneous across mixing groups, because of compensatory behaviors (e.g. children drastically reduce children-children contacts but increase childrenadults contacts during holidays) [61, 40] . Assumptions on the relative role of specific age classes in absence of data may lead to biases in the modeled epidemic outcome, especially for epidemics reporting large differences in attack rates in children vs. adults. Our work highlights the need to expand our knowledge on contacts and associated changes induced by social activity or by the epidemic itself, in order to better parameterize models and provide reliable and accurate results for epidemic management.",

Moreover, the validation analysis shows that considering children and adults and the associated mixing and travel behavior is enough to reproduce the spatio-temporal unfolding of the epidemic to a good accuracy. Also, we did not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic infec-tions. Santermans et al.

To fully assess this aspect, we systematically explored earlier and later epidemics than the 2008/2009 season, thus synthetically accounting for other (similar) influenza seasons. We did not consider age-specific susceptibility, as it was largely addressed for example in studies related to the A(H1N1)v2009 pandemic [21] .

This may help the management of epidemics and lessen the pressure on the public health infrastructure. The effect is due to both school holidays and weekend closures, the latter periodically dampening transmission. Variations in travel behavior do not lead instead to visible effects. The observed impact strongly depends on the timing of the school closure, and to a lesser extent on its duration. Christmas holiday is the school break generally playing the most important role in mitigating the epidemic course, though variations are observed depending on the influenza season (e.g. early vs. late epidemic). The addition of one week extension after Christmas holiday may represent an additional strategy to further delay the epidemic peak and mitigate its impact.",
