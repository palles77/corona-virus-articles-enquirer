            "text": "We have reported on aristeromycin (1) and 6 0 -fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues (2), which are active against RNA viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). However, these exhibit substantial cytotoxicity. As this cytotoxicity may be attributed to 5 0 -phosphorylation, we designed and synthesized one-carbon homologated 6 0 -fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues. This modification prevents 5 0 -phosphorlyation by cellular kinases, whereas the inhibitory activity towards S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase will be retained. The enantiomerically pure 6 0 -fluorinated-5 0 -homoaristeromycin analogues 3a-e were synthesized via the electrophilic fluorination of the silyl enol ether with Selectfluor, using a base-build up approach as the key steps. All synthesized compounds exhibited potent inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase, among which 6 0 -b-fluoroadenosine analogue 3a was the most potent (IC 50 \u00bc 0.36 mM). Among the compounds tested, 6 0 -b-fluoro-homoaristeromycin 3a showed potent antiviral activity (EC 50 \u00bc 0.12 mM) against the CHIKV, without noticeable cytotoxicity up to 250 mM. Only 3a displayed anti-CHIKV activity, whereas both3a and 3b inhibited SAH hydrolase with similar IC 50 values (0.36 and 0.37 mM, respectively), which suggested that 3a's antiviral activity did not merely depend on the inhibition of SAH hydrolase. This is further supported by the fact that the antiviral effect was specific for CHIKV and some other alphaviruses and none of the homologated analogues inhibited other RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and ZIKV. The potent inhibition and high selectivity index make 6 0 -b-fluoro-homoaristeromycin (3a) a promising new template for the development of antivirals against CHIKV, a serious re-emerging pathogen that has infected millions of people over the past 15 years.",

The \u00feRNA viruses form the largest group and contain many important human pathogens, such as dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [3] , middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [4] , Zika virus (ZIKV) [5] , and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [6] .

The 5 0 -end of the genomes of most \u00feRNA viruses contain a cap structure that is important for translation, RNA stability and evasion of host innate immune responses. Capping of viral RNA is usually carried out by one or multiple viral proteins that use S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor. Cellular S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase is a pivotal enzyme in the regeneration cycle of SAM, which serves as a methyl donor in cellular methylation reactions and is required for viral mRNA capping [7] . Inhibition of SAH hydrolase leads to the accumulation of SAH, which in turn inhibits SAM-dependent methylation reactions, including those required for the maturation of viral RNA [7] . Thus, SAH hydrolase is a promising target for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents [8] .",

These compounds were observed to be weak inhibitors of flavivirus replication in plaque reduction assays [10] , whereas they exhibited potent antiviral activity against the replication of ss(\u00c0)RNA viruses such as Ebola [11] . Among these, aristeromycin (1) (Fig. 1) is the representative carbocyclic nucleoside, which was first synthesized in racemic form in 1966 and shortly thereafter, isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces citricolor [12] . It displays potent antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, that result from the inhibition of the SAH hydrolase [8] . Although it is a potent SAH hydrolase inhibitor, its therapeutic utility is limited, because of its significant toxicity [13] . This cytotoxicity may be caused by 5 0phosphorylation of the compound and its inhibition of cellular RNA polymerases and/or incorporation into cellular RNA [13] .",

Among these, 6,6 0 -difluoro-aristeromycin 2 exhibits potent antiviral activities against MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, ZIKV, and CHIKV [14] . However, compound 2 still exhibited substantial cytotoxicity, although it was less cytotoxic than 1. This cytotoxicity may be attributed to 5 0 -phosphorylation, similar to what is presumed for 1. Therefore, it is desirable to design aristeromycin analogues that retain their inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase without being 5 0 -phosphorylated by cellular kinases. Therefore, our strategy was to design 5 0 -homologated analogues that are expected to displace the phosphate-susceptible 5 0 -hydroxyl from the phosphate-transfer zone in the kinases. The feasibility of this strategy is supported by the fact that (\u00c0)-homoaristeromycin is inactive against HSV-1 and HSV-2, possibly, due to its failure to be phosphorylated [15] . Thus, we designed and synthesized 6 0 -fluorinated-5 0 -homoaristeromycin analogues 3aee, which combined the one-carbon homologation at the 5 0 -position with the bioisosteric displacement of the hydrogen with the fluorine at the 6 0 -position. It was expected that compounds 3aee would retain the inhibitory activity against SAH hydrolase, whereas the lack of 5 0phosphorylation would lead to lower cytotoxicity.",

            "text": "Ketone 6 was converted to the amines 18a and 18b, which were the key precursors for the synthesis of the final nucleosides, as shown in Scheme 3. Ketone 6 was treated with lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiHMDS), followed by trapping the resulting enolate with chlorotriethylsilane (TESCl) to produce silyl enol ether. The silyl enol ether was treated with electrophilic fluorine, octane ditetrafluoroborate) to produce desired 6-b-fluoro-cyclopentanone 14 as the single stereoisomer, which was equilibrated to geminal diol because of the electronegative fluorine atom [14, 16, 17] . The b stereochemistry of fluorine was obtained because of the steric hindrance by the 2,3-isopropylidene group, which was confirmed by long-range coupling between H-8 and 6 0 -b-F and Xray crystallography after conversion to adenosine derivative 3a. 6,6-Difluoro ketone 15 was synthesized from 14 in a 50% yield using the same procedure. Fluoro ketones 14 and 15 were reduced with sodium borohydride to produce alcohols 16a and 16b, respectively. First, we attempted a direct condensation reaction with 6chloropurine under the Mitsunobu conditions to obtain the desired nucleoside, but it failed to yield the desired condensed product. Direct S N 2 reactions of triflates synthesized from 16a and 16b with a 6-chloropurine anion were also unsuccessful. Thus, we decided to utilize the linear purine base build-up approach [14] . The S N 2 displacement of triflates of 16a and 16b with a linear, less bulky and more powerful nucleophile, NaN 3 proceeded smoothly to yield azido derivatives 17a and 17b, respectively. Catalytic reduction of 17a and 17b with 10% Pd/C yielded amines 18a and 18b, respectively. 6-Fluoroamine 18a was treated with 5-amino-4,6dichloropyrimidine and triethylamine in n-butanol under microwave irradiation to yield 19a (Scheme 4) [14, 16] . However, weaker nucleophile, 6,6-difluoroamine 18b did not give desired product 19b under the same microwave conditions. Thus, we used a stronger electrophile, 4,6-dichloro-5-formamidopyrimidine rather than 5-amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine, which afforded the desired product 19b in a good yield. The cyclisation of 19a and 19b with diethoxymethyl acetate yielded 6-chloropurine nucleosides 20a and 20b, respectively. The H-8 proton in the 1 H NMR spectrum of 20a was split as a doublet with a small coupling constant (J \u00bc 2.4 Hz), which resulted from the long-range coupling between H-8 and 6 0 -b-F, which confirmed the desired stereochemistry of 6 0 -F, as well as 6-chloropurine.",

In addition, although 6,6 0 -difluoroaristeromycin 2b displayed broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, CHIKV, and ZIKV, the corresponding homologated analogue 3d did not exhibit antiviral activity, despite its potent inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase. These results demonstrate that other factors besides the inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase may be involved in the antiviral activity of this series. More detailed studies on the antiviral activity of 3a and its mode of action will be published elsewhere (Kovacikova et al., submitted).",

            "text": "To reduce the cytotoxicity of 6 0 -fluorinated aristeromycin analogues 2a and 2b, which is likely due to their 5 0 -phosphorylation by cellular kinases, we designed and synthesized 6 0 -fluorinated homoaristeromycin analogues 3ae3e. These nucleosides were synthesized from D-ribose, using the Michael reaction, stereoselective electrophilic fluorination, and linear purine base build-up as key steps. Among the compounds tested, 6 0 -b-fluoro-homoaristeromycin (3a) showed potent anti-CHIKV activity (EC 50 \u00bc 0.12 mM) without noticeable cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 250 mM, which resulted in a high selectivity index (SI) of more than 2083. This indicates that one carbon homologation may prevent 5 0 -phosphorylation, which results in low cytotoxicity. This homologation had no effect on the inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase, as compounds 3a and 2a inhibited this enzyme with similar IC 50 values (0.36 and 0.37 mM). The antiviral activity of 3a was specific for CHIKV and to a lesser extent some other alphaviruses, whereas other viruses have been shown to be sensitive to the SAH hydrolase inhibitors 2a and 2b. This suggests that the potent anti-CHIKV activity of 3a is based on more than merely the inhibition of SAH hydrolase. This study shows that 6 0 -b-fluoro-homoaristeromycin (3a) is a promising new template for the development of anti-CHIKV agents.",

Coupling constants were reported in Hertz. The chemical shifts were reported as ppm (d) relative to the solvent peak. All reactions were routinely carried out under an inert atmosphere of dry nitrogen. IKA RCT basic type heating mantle was used to provide a constant heat source. Microwave-assisted reactions were carried out in sealed vessels using a Biotage Initiator\u00fe US/JPN (part no. 356007) microwave reactor and the reaction temperatures were monitored by an external surface IR sensor. High resolution mass spectra were measured with electrospray-ionization quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-Q-TOF) techniques. Melting points were recorded on Barnstead electrothermal 9100 instrument and are uncorrected. Reactions were checked by thin layer chromatography (Kieselgel 60 F254, Merck). Spots were detected by viewing under a UV light, and by colorizing with charring after dipping in a p-anisaldehyde solution. The crude compounds were purified by column chromatography on a silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 70e230 mesh, Merck).
