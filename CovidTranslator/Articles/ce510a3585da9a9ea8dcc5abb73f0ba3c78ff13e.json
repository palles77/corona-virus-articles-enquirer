In addition, several experiments have shown that NGP1-01 has neuroprotective activity ( Fig. 1) . 6 Based on the interesting and widely observed biological activity of amantadine, memantine, and NGP1-01, we therefore sought to explore the biological profile of (2-oxaadamant-1-yl)amine derivatives.",

            "text": "In the last years there has been an intensive research on the development of new NMDA receptor antagonists, since this sub- type of receptors has been involved in the apoptotic process that develops during neurodegenerative diseases. Memantine is a non-competitive and low affinity blocker that acts selectively on NMDA receptors that is being used in Alzheimer's disease to slow down its progression. 10 The activity of the different (2-oxaadamant-1-yl)amines was assayed on cerebellar granule neurons loaded with the calcium-sensitive probe Fura-2. 11 Addition of glutamate or NMDA (100 lM) in the presence of glycine (10 lM) produced a robust and stable increase in intracellular calcium that was challenged with cumulative additions of the compounds to be tested. The data presented in Table 1 indicate that the presence of a substituent in C-3 in the 2-oxaadamantane nucleus is essential for NMDA receptor antagonism. Thus, primary amine 7 and all its N-alkylated and Ndialkylated derivatives (2a,b, 3a,b, 4, and 8) are inactive as it is the case of the methyl derivatives 10a and 11a. Phenyl derivative 10c is only a weak NMDA receptor antagonist while more lipophilic amines 10b and 10d show a similar potency than amantadine. Further enhancement in potency was achieved by alkylation of 10b, the most active derivative being 12, a tertiary amine that is seven times more potent than amantadine, but still ten times less potent than memantine. Contrary to our expectations, all the benzyl derivatives were found to be inactive. This is in striking contrast with NGP1-01 that features a benzyl group essential for NMDA receptor antagonism, and with previous work by our groups that found that benzylated ring-contracted analogues of amantadine showed NMDA receptor antagonism. 12",

In contrast with the model compound NGP1-01, all our benzyl derivatives were devoid of NMDA receptor antagonism activity. None of the tested compounds showed antiviral activity. Two tertiary amines, 11a and 11b, displayed a significant level of trypanocidal activity; 11a was twice as active as rimantadine. The mechanism by which adamantylamine derivatives kill trypanosomes is unknown, but it has been hypothesized by analogy with the known properties of this class of compound that it may involve channel blocking activity. 4 The data obtained with the trimethyl amine 11a now provides a basis for exploring if related derivatives have enhanced activity.",

The suspension was filtered, the residue was washed with EtOH, and the combined organic filtrates were concentrated in vacuo to give a solid. 2 N NaOH (25 mL) was added to the residue which was then extracted with EtOAc (3 \u00c2 25 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried with anhyd Na 2 SO 4 , filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to give a residue that was sublimed at 60\u00b0C/2 Torr to give amine 7. Its hydrochloride (1.05 g, 70% yield) was obtained by adding an excess of a solution of HCl in MeOH to the amine, followed by concentration in vacuo. The analytical sample of 7\u00c1HCl was obtained by crystallization from MeOH, mp > 218\u00b0C (dec.).

Cells were loaded with 6 lM Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) for 45 min. Afterwards, the coverslip was mounted on a quartz cuvette containing a Locke-Hepes buffer using a special holder. Measurements were performed using a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorometer equipped with a fast-filter accessory, under mild agitation and at 37\u00b0C. Analysis from each sample was recorded real-time during 1200 s. After stimulation with NMDA or glutamate (100 lM, in the presence of 10 lM glycine), increasing cumulative concentrations of the compound to be tested were added. The percentages of inhibition at every tested concentration were analyzed using a nonlinear regression curve fitting (variable slope) by using the software GraphPad Prism 4.0.",
