            "text": "This prospective longitudinal study investigated the epidemiology of enteric disease associated with infections in calves aging up to 70 days. A total of 850 fecal samples were collected from 67 calves. Seventeen isolates of Salmonella spp. were recovered from feces of 11 calves (16.4 %), and statistical analysis revealed no association between the presence of Salmonella spp. and clinical signs of diarrhea or age. Virulence factors of Escherichia coli were identified in 103 strains: eae (7), K99/STa (7), Stx1 (7), Stx1/eae (36), Stx1/Stx2/eae (2), Stx2 (43), and Stx2/eae (1). There was statistical association between diarrheic animals carrying E. coli Stx1/eae + in their feces at 2 and 4 weeks of age (P= 0.003) and E. coli Stx2 + at 5 weeks of age (P=0.03). Rotavirus was detected in 49 (5.76 %) fecal samples collected from 33 calves (49.2 %). The presence of rotavirus was correlated with diarrheic feces (P<0.0001) rather than feces with normal consistency. There was a significant relationship between age group and diarrhea (P = 0.001). Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was detected in 93 fecal samples collected from 46 calves (68.6 %). There was an association (P<0.0001) between diarrheic animals positive for BCoV and age groups. The results demonstrate the importance of the pathogens studied in the etiology of diarrhea in calves.",

Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) has two major virulence factors: F5 and/or F41 fimbriae that mediate adherence to the ileum and the production of heat-stable enterotoxin (STa), which is responsible for liquid hypersecretion into the gut lumen. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) causes attaching and effacing (A/E) intestinal lesions and produces intimin, an outer membrane protein encoded by the eae gene, which mediates the intimate attachment of bacteria to the enterocyte. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strains cause hemorrhagic colitis (HC) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans. EHEC and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) produce two types of Shiga toxins: Stx1 or Stx2. Moreover, EHEC also produces intimin (eae gene) (DebRoy and Maddox 2001; Mainil 2013) .",

Serotypes Agona, Enteritidis, and S. enterica subsp. Enterica were isolated from fecal samples in the present study and in other studies (Ambrosin et al. 2002; Younis et al. 2009; Cummings et al. 2009a, b) . In our study, the low number of animals infected and the serotypes detected, added the fact that no other enteric pathogen investigated was identified in animals infected with Salmonella spp., may explain why salmonellosis was not associated with diarrhea.",

All three groups EHEC, EPEC, and STEC cause diarrhea in calves (Blanchard 2012) , and although there was no association with diarrhea, these pathotypes were detected as sole agents in feces of diarrheic calves and might be important enteropathogens. There was statistical association between diarrheic animals carrying E. coli Stx1/eae + (EHEC) in their feces with two and four weeks of age and E. coli Stx2 + (STEC) with five weeks of age. EHEC and STEC strains are associated with diarrhea in 1-to 8-week-old calves (DebRoy and Maddox 2001). Orden et al. (1998) found that the risk of infection with STEC increased with age.

(2010) detected the highest prevalence of GARV infection in animals within the second week of age; however, virus infection was associated with diarrhea in animals within the first week. Fecal shedding of rotavirus in diarrheic and asymptomatic calves has been reported in other studies, and as in this study, the presence of the virus in the feces was associated with diarrhea (P\u00e9rez et al. 1998; Alfieri et al. 2006; Bartels et al. 2010) . Passive immunity may reduce the frequency of diarrhea caused by rotavirus in calves aged 1 week, and as calves get infected throughout calf rearing, the increased natural resistance reduces infection in calves older than 4 weeks . Moreover, newborn calves have slow replacement of enterocytes, and those animals are more susceptible to diarrhea. There is competition between viral replication and enterocyte replacement, and highly virulent virus could cause diarrhea in older calves (Dodet et al. 1997) . These results reinforce rotavirus as an important agent of diarrhea in calves and the importance of management and prophylactic programs to reduce rotavirus infection in calves within this age group.",

According to Torres-Medina et al.

These results demonstrate that in naturally infected calves, rotavirus shedding occurs for up to 3-5 days and serve as important reservoir for susceptible calves, especially young ones.",

Stipp et al. (2009) detected BCoV in calves from 1 to 60 days old, and the cases were concentrated in calves 16 to 30 days old. Torres-Medina et al. (1985) showed BCoV occurs mainly in animals less than 1 month old and generally affects calves at 7 to 10 days of age. BCoV can infect animals up to 60 days old, and those within the second and third weeks of age develop diarrhea, due to the decrease of colostral antibodies present in the first week of age and the natural resistance acquired after infections, rendering the calf susceptible to the infection with this virus during this age ). It should be noticed that in our study, BCoV was detected in calves older than 30 days and with no diarrhea, probably because of acquired immunity, which might explain no association with diarrhea.",

Passive immunity reduces the frequency of diarrhea in calves within the first week of age, and the increased natural resistance, as calves get infected throughout calf rearing, helps to reduce diarrhea in older calves. The results of this study show that diarrhea is an important disease of young cattle with high frequency in calves in the first and second weeks of age and enteropathogens are detected in calves with diarrhea mainly within the first 3 weeks of age which could explain the high frequency of clinical signs during this age. Although Salmonella may be present in the herd, the outcome of diarrhea is affected by other factors, and Escherichia coli pathotypes should be considered when investigating the cause of diarrhea. Rotavirus and coronavirus are common viruses among diarrheic calves under 1 month of age, and calves are exposed to infection right after birth. Infected animals may shed the virus more than once, becoming a source of infection for susceptible young calves. Producers and veterinarians should focus on implementing preventive programs to reduce calf diarrhea, such as biosecurity, immunity, good nutrition, and animal welfare.",
