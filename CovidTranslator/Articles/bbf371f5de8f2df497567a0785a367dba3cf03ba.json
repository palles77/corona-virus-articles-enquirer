Similarly, the best known pathogens of companion animals causing immunodeficiencies are the feline retroviruses feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV). However, several other pathogens are capable of disrupting normal immune function. Many infectious agents disrupt host barriers to infection. This may result from the inflammatory response to a pathogen or direct damage by the microbe itself. Examples include disruption of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier by canine parvovirus, destruction of nasal turbinates by Aspergillus fumigatus in canine sinonasal aspergillosis, or paralysis of the respiratory cilia by Bordetella bronchiseptica. Anaplasma phagocytophilum disables neutrophil function, ensuring its survival within a cell normally charged with antimicrobial substances. Viruses, such as canine distemper virus, cause lymphopenia; the outcome of infection depends on the balance between viral destruction of the immune system and the ability of the remaining immune defenses to eliminate the virus.",

The virus also infects several other species, including foxes, raccoons, skunks, ferrets, and free-ranging and captive felids. Disease in dogs is most prevalent in regions where vaccination of young dogs against the disease is either not performed or is poorly timed, and epidemics continue to occur in shelter environments in developed countries. 1 Canine distemper virus is a Morbillivirus related to measles virus and has been used to study the pathogenesis of measles virus infection. Morbilliviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that survive poorly in the environment. Based on genetic variation within the viral hemagglutinin (H) gene, a multitude of different strains of CDV exist that vary in their geographic distribution, cell tropism, and virulence. Although CDV infects a variety of different cell types, including epithelial, mesenchymal, neuroendocrine, and hematopoietic cells, the marked tropism of CDV for immune cells is critical in respect to its ability to cause immunosuppression. Viral components involved in CDV-induced immunodeficiency include the viral hemagglutinin; the V protein (a nonstructural phosphoprotein); and the nucleocapsid (N) protein.",

CD41 T cells are preferentially depleted during the acute phase, which is followed by CD81 cell depletion. 5, 6 Necrosis of hematopoietic cells within the bone marrow may result in leucopenia. 7 Infection of ferrets has been used as a model of CDV-induced immunosuppression. 8 CDV infection of ferrets leads to dramatic reduction in cell-mediated immune function with markedly depressed lymphocyte proliferative activity, and to some extent delayed type hypersensitivity responses. The virus enters lymphocytes following binding of the viral H gene to the primary receptor for the virus, signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (CD150, SLAM). The expression of SLAM appears to be upregulated in response to CDV infection. 9 SLAM is also expressed on antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and activated monocytes, and infection of these cells, which may predominate in the chronic phase of infection, has been hypothesized to be associated with impaired antigen presentation. 1, 6 Infection of dendritic cells within the thymus may lead to impaired maturation and selection of T cells, with subsequent release of immature CD5-T cells, including cells that may have the potential for autoreactivity. 6 Lymphocyte apoptosis also occurs independent of viral infection in canine distemper, although the mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. 10 The presence of the viral V protein is essential to permit rapid replication of CDV in T cells and critical in CDV-mediated immunosuppression. This protein almost completely antagonizes alpha interferon, TNF-alpha, Il-6, gamma-interferon, and Il-2 in the acute phase of infection. 3 Suppression of the cytokine response is associated with severe immunosuppression and a fatal outcome in ferrets. Finally, the N protein of Morbilliviruses may interfere with the immune response through the binding of the CD32 (Fc-gamma) receptor on B cells, resulting in impaired differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. 11 Binding of this receptor on dendritic cells 12 is associated with impairment of antigen presentation by dendritic cells and resulting disruption of T cell function.",

Since its emergence in 1978, CPV has subsequently mutated to CPV-2a; CPV-2b; and in the last decade, CPV-2c, which was first documented in Italy and has subsequently spread to dogs on every continent, with the exception of Australia. The CPV-2c strain appears to be particularly virulent and there has been some debate regarding the ability of current vaccines to protect against it and the ability of commercially available SNAP ELISA tests to detect the virus. 19 CPV and FPV have tropism for rapidly dividing cells. As such, they exert an effect on the host that resembles the outcome of treatment with a chemotherapeutic drug. The virus binds and enters cells using the transferrin receptor. 20 Cells preferentially involved are the crypt cells of the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissue. Leukopenia results from sequestration of neutrophils within damaged gastrointestinal tissue and is compounded by destruction of white cell precursors within the bone marrow. Damage to the gastrointestinal barrier can result in translocation of enteric bacteria. In the face of the massive immunosuppression that ensues as a result of virus-induced neutropenia and lymphopenia, the host fails to contain bacterial replication and bacteremia and sepsis ensue. Treatment of secondary infections with broad-spectrum parenteral antimicrobial drugs is critical to permit recovery of dogs and cats from parvoviral infection. Bacterial causes of sepsis reported in infected animals include Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, and Clostridium difficile. Giardia infection also exacerbates illness. 21 Immunosuppression may also contribute to replication of other co-infecting enteric viruses, such as enteric coronavirus, which in turn exacerbate the damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa. Similarly, CPV-induced immunosuppression potentiates the development of postvaccinal canine distemper encephalitis. 22 The importance of secondary infections in the pathogenesis of parvovirus infections is highlighted by the fact that experimental infection of germfree cats is not associated with development of clinical illness, despite the associated reduction in white cell count. 23 ",

The development of opportunistic infections may result from marrow failure or cell-mediated immunodeficiency. The immunosuppressive properties of FeLV have been linked at least in part to the transmembrane viral envelope peptide, Immunodeficiencies Caused by Infectious Diseases p15E. 29 This viral protein inhibits T-and B-cell function, inhibits cytotoxic lymphocyte responses, alters monocyte morphology and distribution, and has been associated with impaired cytokine production and responsiveness. [30] [31] [32] Kittens persistently infected with FeLV have impaired T-cell, and to a lesser extent, B-cell function. [33] [34] [35] [36] Infected cats may develop lymphopenia, thymic atrophy, and depletion of lymphocytes within lymph node paracortical zones. CD41 T-cell malfunction may contribute to a decreased humoral and cellular immune response in affected cats. 37, 38 The response to vaccination may also be impaired. Neutrophil function is also impaired in cats that are FeLV-infected. [39] [40] [41] Opportunistic infections documented in cats that are FeLV-infected include bacterial infections of the upper and lower urinary tract, hemoplasmosis, respiratory tract infections, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), and chronic stomatitis, although there is little evidence in the literature to support an increased prevalence of these infections in cats with FeLV as opposed to cats not infected with FeLV. Some infections, such as cryptococcosis, appear to occur with the same frequency in cats that are FeLV positive as in cats that are FeLV negative, but may be more severe and refractory to therapy (Fig. 2) . 42",

FIV invades cells via the primary receptor CD134, which is expressed on feline CD41 T lymphocytes; B lymphocytes; activated macrophages 43, 44 ; and the secondary receptor CXCR4, a chemokine receptor. The mechanisms of immunosuppression in FIV infection are complex, and despite more than 20 years of research on the subject, not completely understood. Paradoxically, immune suppression and immune hyperactivation have been documented in infected cats. A comprehensive review of the subject is beyond the scope of this article but has been recently published elsewhere. 45 Central to FIV-induced immunosuppression is a progressive reduction in CD41 Tcell numbers. The number of CD41 T cells in peripheral blood declines shortly after infection, owing to initial viral replication within target activated CD41 T cells and macrophages. After this acute phase of infection, numbers of CD41 T cells rebound and viremia is suppressed (Fig. 3) . Neutropenia can also occur during this phase 46 and it has been suggested that this may result from neutrophil apoptosis. 47 CD41/CD251 T regulator cells have recently been shown to be infected and activated during acute infection. When activated, these cells inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of other activated CD41 or CD81 T cells, which may also contribute to persistence of FIV and further immunosuppression. 45, 48, 49 Evidence also points to altered dendritic cell function during acute FIV infection. 50, 51 The impairment of T-cell function in acute FIV infection has been suggested to result from cytokine dysregulation, immunologic anergy, and increased apoptosis. 45 In turn, this is associated with an inability to mount a primary immune response to opportunistic pathogens.",

In addition to a decline in cell numbers, although activated, paradoxically, T cells develop a reduced ability to respond to antigenic stimulation. Altered lymphocyte expression of cell surface molecules, including CD4, cytokine receptors and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II antigens, and continued alteration of dendritic cell function, also contribute to immunosuppression. Dysregulation of cytokine production occurs. Cats chronically infected with FIV fail to produce Il-2, Il-6, and Il-12 in response to T gondii infection, instead producing elevated levels of the antiinflammatory cytokine Il-10. 45, 52 Ultimately these changes lead to opportunistic infections, most commonly bacterial infections of the mouth; chronic bacterial skin infections; persistent viral upper respiratory tract infections; mycobacterial infections; hemoplasmosis; toxoplasmosis; and parasitic infections, such as demodicosis and severe flea burdens. the immune response. 53 The mechanism of T cell depletion is not clear, because the virus does not infect lymphocytes, only monocytes and macrophages. Infection of antigen-presenting cells, specifically dendritic cells, by the virus has been hypothesized to cause T-cell apoptosis. 53 Despite the profound T-cell deficiency that accompanies FIP, opportunistic infections are rarely reported, perhaps partly as a result of the rapidly fatal clinical course of disease.",

Human infection with Bartonella bacilliformis infection may be immunosuppressive and many patients have succumbed with secondary bacterial infections, especially salmonellosis. 54 Impaired leukocyte function, cyclic CD81 lymphopenia, and diminished expression of adhesion molecules and MHC Class II molecules by CD81 and B lymphocytes, respectively, were documented in one study of Bartonella vinsonii subspecies berkhoffii-infected dogs. 55 Hemoplasma-induced immunosuppression is not a new phenomenon and has been recognized as a problem in experiments involving chronically infected laboratory rodents and in sheep chronically infected with Mycoplasma ovis. 56, 57 The clinical importance of immunosuppression induced by Bartonella spp and hemoplasmas in cats and dogs requires further investigation.",

In the United States, disease is diagnosed most frequently in dogs living in the southeastern and southwestern states, but because of chronic, subclinical infection, dogs can be transported to non-endemic regions and subsequently develop disease.

Clinical signs of acute disease include depression, inappetence, fever, and weight loss. Ocular and nasal discharges, edema, hemorrhages, and neurologic signs may also occur. The organism replicates in reticuloendothelial cells with generalized lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, and transient cytopenias, especially thrombocytopenia, may occur. After the acute phase, which may last up to 6 weeks, a subclinical phase may develop that lasts months to years. During this phase, the organism appears to evade host immune responses through antigenic variation. Ultimately, a small percentage of these infected dogs develop chronic CME. Chronic CME is characterized by signs that include lethargy, inappetence, fever, weight loss, bleeding tendencies, pallor, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, dyspnea, anterior uveitis, polyuria/polydipsia, muscle wasting, polyarthritis, and edema. Dogs with severe chronic ehrlichiosis may develop marrow failure, with aplastic pancytopenia. Severe disease may also be associated with a protein-losing nephropathy and development of neurologic signs. Some dogs have bone marrow plasmacytosis and peripheral granular lymphocytosis. Hyperglobulinemia is a frequent finding on the serum chemistry profile and usually results from a polyclonal gammopathy, although monoclonal gammopathies have also been reported. 58 High antibody titers to E canis, occasionally exceeding 1:1,000,000, are also common.",

After inoculation into the host, A phagocytophilum attaches to sialylated ligands on the surface of neutrophils, after which it enters neutrophils via caveolae-mediated endocytosis, bypassing phagolysosomal pathways. A phagocytophilum then actively disables neutrophil bactericidal functions, in particular neutrophil superoxide production, thus promoting its own survival. 64, 65 A phagocytophilum also reduces neutrophil mobility and phagocytosis, 66 and reduces endothelial adherence and transmigration of neutrophils. 67 By inhibiting neutrophil apoptosis, the organism is able to survive in a well-differentiated cell that normally has a very short lifespan. The impairment of neutrophil function and leukopenia that develop as a result of A phagocytophilum infection is occasionally associated with development of opportunistic infections in some humans and animals with granulocytic anaplasmosis. The best example of this is tick pyemia, which is a debilitating lameness and paralysis that develops in infected lambs in Europe, most commonly as a result of disseminated Staphylococcus aureus or Pasteurella spp infection. Infection with A phagocytophilum may influence the outcome of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, which can be co-transmitted by Ixodes ticks, possibly as a result of impaired neutrophil function. 68 ",

The mechanisms of immunosuppression induced by this organism are perhaps the best studied amongst protozoal parasites. The disease is most common in the Mediterranean basin and South America. The organism causes a systemic disease in dogs characterized by lymphadenopathy, crusting skin lesions, weight loss, anemia, ocular lesions, polyarthritis, and proteinlosing nephropathy. The infection is often associated with other infections, especially ehrlichiosis and babesiosis, and occasionally with neoplastic disease, especially hematopoietic tumors. 69 Leishmania infantum invades mononuclear phagocytes, evading the phagolysosome, and survives within them through inhibition of the respiratory burst, inhibition of macrophage function and apoptosis, and impairment of antigen presentation through inhibition of MHC Class I and MHC Class II molecule expression. The protozoan also appears to impair macrophage and neutrophil chemotaxis, and interferes with Il-12 transcription. 70 The Leishmania spp surface protein gp63 is a key protein that mediates entry and survival within macrophages. It also allows the organism to resist complement and was recently shown to bind to and suppress the activity of NK cells. 71 Several fungal pathogens are capable of causing immunosuppression, including Aspergillus spp, Candida spp, and Cryptococcus spp. Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are highly immunosuppressive fungal pathogens, although co-infections with other pathogens are rarely documented. Cryptococcal organisms possess several potent virulence factors that are capable of suppressing or orchestrating the immune response in favor of fungal growth and persistence. The cryptococcal capsular polysaccharide, glucuronoxylomannan, has attracted the most attention in this regard (Fig. 6) . It effectively inhibits phagocytosis and interferes with migration of leukocytes from the bloodstream into tissues by causing them to shed selectin. It can also deplete complement and directly inhibits T-cell responses. 72, 73 There is a shift from a Th1 to a Th2 immune response, the Th1 response being normally required for organism clearance. The cryptococcal urease enzyme was shown to promote accumulation of immature dendritic cells within the lung, and an associated shift in the immune response to a non-protective Th2-cytokine dominated response. 71 ",

Because of the cascading mechanisms involved in normal immune cell recruitment, cytokine and antibody production, pathogens frequently disrupt the function of immune cells that do not undergo direct infection. Considerable research effort has been invested in understanding the mechanisms of pathogen-induced immunosuppression, with the hope that effective therapies may be developed that reverse the immunodeficiencies developed and in turn assist the host to clear persistent or life-threatening infectious diseases.
