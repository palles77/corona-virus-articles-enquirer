This standardization included comparing germicidal chemicals and provided an index to the concentration of other products.

It also reacts with organic soils (e.g., feces) to produce potentially carcinogenic compounds. One resulting compound, trihalomethane, can be released as a toxic gas. Therefore, supervisors must carefully consider the use of bleach and ensure when making up a bleach-water solution to maintain adequate chlorine concentrations (i.e., 100 p.p.m.). Sodium hypochlorite is highly reactive and degrades rather quickly. Thus, as Fig.1 shows, bleach rapidly loses its effectiveness as sodium hypochlorite degrades. The Quality Assurance Laboratory of Pharmacal Research Laboratories conducted a test that simulated normal laboratory storage conditions. We stored a simple solution of 18.0% sodium hypochlorite in an opaque bottle that was capped and left on a countertop in the laboratory to simulate a bleach bottle stored on the shelf at room temperature. The overhead lights were turned on in the morning and off at night 5 days a week, allowing for \u223c9 h of illumination per day. We locked the laboratory and left it vacant during the weekends. For a 70-day period we analyzed daily samples from the bottle and recorded the percentage of active sodium hypochlorite in the sample. Our results showed an initial decelerating curve of degradation of the percentage of active sodium hypochlorite. At 5 days, the solution measured 15.68% sodium hypochlorite; at 20 days it was 13.72%. At 35 days, the percentage was 12.74% with the rate of degradation substantially decreased. The shelf life of commercially available sodium hypochlorite mixtures (bleach) will depend on the storage facility, temperature controls, light controls, etc. Facility managers should label and check the product regularly using available chlorine detection strips or test kits.",

After inoculation of penicylinders (porcelain cylinders) and surgical loops with specific microorganisms, one vacuum-dries them, making the pathogen even more resistant to penetration and killing by the disinfectant. Then one exposes the cylinders or loops to the specific product in the proposed use dilution. After a specified period, which follows the manufacturer's claims for kill time, the testers are removed and placed in a culture medium. The literature that the manufacturer submits to the EPA will include the recommended exposure time for the product to achieve a complete kill. The sporicidal test involves either B. subtilis or C. sporogenes. Analysts examine the resulting growth for the specific microorganism. They repeat this process extensively, and the chemical being tested must prevent growth in 60 of 60 tests for a total of 12 sets of tests involving 360 penicylinders and 360 surgical loops, and three lots of each product",

The tests specify a minimum, but not a maximum number of microorganisms per assay, and this can of course drastically affect the test results. The result has been perhaps a false sense of security about the effectiveness of particular products. Since 1991, the EPA has been reevaluating the specific claims of many germicides. Some products that had been listed as \"sterilants\" before 1991 were reclassified as \"high-level disinfectants\" after these reevaluations (see www.epa.gov/pesticides).",
