Because the efficacy of vaccines for a number of the diseases discussed in this volume cannot be tested directly in humans, alternative approaches have been developed to address this challenge. The major elements of typical clinical trial protocol are discussed, and a checklist of essential documents supporting the trial is provided. As novel vaccine approaches and technologies emerge, the regulatory and ethical considerations will need to be revisited and adapted to respond to the everchanging landscape.",

Major scientific, technical, ethical, and regulatory principles and/or processes underpinning the vaccine development and evaluation process have been defined; however, challenges posed by the threats of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases, as well as technological advances in the composition, formulation, and delivery of vaccines, expose gaps in policy and practice that require ongoing consideration and refinement of approaches to the evaluation of new vaccines. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of the approach to the evaluation of candidate vaccines in humans, with a particular attention to issues related to vaccines for biodefense and emerging and neglected diseases. The major focus will be on clinical trials and protocol development in the US, although many of the principles, regulations, and practices have been harmonized across the globe. A brief overview of related regulatory issues and preclinical vaccine development is provided; however, detailed discussions of these topics can be found elsewhere in this volume.",

This episode resulted in the first legislation designed to regulate the purity and potency of biologicals -the Biologics Control Act (BCA) of 1902. In 1938, over 100 people died after ingesting an elixir of sulfanilamide containing diethylene glycol (antifreeze), leading to the enactment of the FDCA ( Ballentine, 1981 ) . Provisions of the FDCA required manufacturers to submit safety data to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to registration. The 1962 Kefauver -Harris Amendments to the FDCA required that efficacy data also be submitted. The1944 Public Health Service Act incorporated the BCA into section 351 of the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which gave the federal government the authority to license biologicals and manufacturing facilities. In 1955, incomplete inactivation of a poliovirus vaccine resulted in the development of polio in a number of children (the \" Cutter Incident \" ); this led to the establishment of the Division of Biologics Standards (DBS) within the NIH ( Offit, 2005 ) . The authority vested in the DBS was transferred to the FDA in 1972. The organization that is currently responsible for regulating biologics is the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the FDA. Title 21 of the CFR contains regulations pertaining to biologicals, including product standards, manufacturing, labeling, licensing, advertising, investigational use, and protection of human subjects (informed consent, nonclinical laboratory studies, and Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs). Part 312 of Title 21 CFR contains regulations related to the Investigational New Drug Application (IND). The CFR is updated each year to reflect changes in policies and procedures. Additional guidance documents related to vaccines are published by the FDA, as appropriate.",

The ICH GCP provides a unified standard to ensure the quality of clinical trial data and the protection of human subjects for the European Union, Japan, and the US for clinical trials that will support licensure of new vaccines and drugs. For research related to the evaluation of vaccines for emerging and neglected diseases, implementation of GCP in developing countries may pose unique challenges. Acosta et al.

This article and the subsequent expose of the ethical violations perpetrated during the Tuskeege Syphilis Study led to the 1974 National Research Act, which established IRBs and the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. After considering the principles and practices of human research in the US, the commission published the Belmont Report in 1979. This report defined the three major ethical principles (and their related clinical trial applications) pertaining to human research: respect for persons (informed consent); beneficence (risk-benefit assessment); and justice (equitable subject selection). Recommendations of the National Bioethics Commission from 1981 related to research involving human subjects were adopted into federal law in 1991. The so-called Common Rule (45 CFR 46 Subpart A) articulated the federal policy for protection of human subjects who are participating in clinical trials. Additional protections for pregnant women and fetuses, prisoners, and children are outlined in Subparts B, C, and D of 45 CFR 46.

(2000) : the research should provide information that will advance science and knowledge (value); scientific validity; fair subject selection; favorable risk-benefit ratio; independent review; informed consent; and respect for enrolled subjects. The increasing complexity and redundancy of the oversight of contemporary clinical trials reflects the commitment to accomplish these goals.

Typically less than 100 healthy young adult subjects are enrolled in phase 1 trials. In fact, the number may be considerably smaller for novel products, in which case investigators may elect to inoculate only a handful of subjects to exclude the possibility of unexpected reactogenicity or toxicity ( Keitel et al., 1993a ) . The major goal of the phase 1 trial is to assess safety and tolerability; however, preliminary immunogenicity assessments and dose-ranging information can provide valuable information regarding dosage selection for subsequent evaluations. Although the design of phase 1 clinical trials of drugs often is open-label, many contemporary phase 1 clinical trials of candidate vaccines are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The phase 1 trial may be performed in stages, where a small cohort of subjects is vaccinated and observed for a period of 1 -4 or more weeks before the remainder of the study cohort is vaccinated in stage 2. This approach reduces the exposure of subjects to the occurrence of unexpected toxicity. For vaccines that are produced in the US whose ultimate use will be in other countries (such as malaria vaccines), the initial evaluation occurs in the US (phase 1a), followed by phase 1b testing in a healthy population in the target country. Inclusion of placebos in this and other phases of development reduces bias in the assessment of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), and provides internal controls for laboratory assessments of immune responses following immunization.",

In some circumstances, specific monitoring of subjects in phase 1 or phase 2 trials for evidence of infection after immunization is relevant, particularly if there are concerns that the vaccine might elicit immunopathologic responses when the vaccinated subject is naturally infected. Immunopatholgy resulting in severe atypical infection and/or death occurred among persons immunized with an inactivated measles vaccine and in infants given an inactivated vaccine to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine ( Polack, 2007 ) .

A phase 3 clinical trial for prevention of disease that occurs at a low incidence may require hundreds of thousands of subjects, such as the US field trial of inactivated poliovirus vaccine in the 1950s ( Francis, 1955 ) ; whereas phase 3 trials of vaccines for prevention of high-incidence infections (such as RSV in infants) theoretically would require no more than hundreds of subjects, particularly if the vaccine was expected to be highly efficacious.",

For example, smallpox, inhalational anthrax, hemorrhagic fever viruses, tularemia, plague, and influenza A/H5N1 do not occur naturally at a frequency high enough to permit controlled evaluation of clinical vaccine efficacy prior to licensure of vaccines. The FDA final rule entitled \" New Drug and Biological Drug Products: Evidence Needed to Demonstrate Effectiveness of New Drugs When Human Efficacy Studies Are Not Ethical or Feasible \" (otherwise referred to as the \" Animal Rule \" ) was published to address this circumstance ( FDA, 2002 ) . The rule permits use of animal efficacy data when collection of human efficacy data is not feasible. Safety and immunogenicity data in humans and animal efficacy data can be used to support licensure when several conditions are met, as follows: (1) the pathophysiology of the infection is reasonably well understood; (2) the pathogenesis and immune responses in one or two animal species are expected to predict these responses in humans; (3) the immunogenicity endpoint(s) correlated with protection in the animal(s) are related to human immune responses; and (4) immunogenicity phase 1 evaluation for the assessment of drugs and therapeutic biologicals ( FDA, 2006 ) . The exploratory IND study option is characterized as a small early phase 1 trial that has no therapeutic or diagnostic intent; rather, the goal is to assess feasibility for further development of a drug or biological. Goals of this type of study may include determination of the mechanism of action of a drug in humans; evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of the agent; selection of one from a group of promising candidates; and exploring biodistribution characteristics using imaging techniques. Because these studies pose lower potential risk to subjects, exploratory IND studies require less or different preclinical support than typical phase 1 studies.",

Several hundred healthy subjects may be enrolled into phase 2 trials. The major goals of phase 2 trials are to assess safety and to develop optimal regimens for immunization. Typically several dosage levels are evaluated; different immunization regimens (number of doses and interval between doses) also may be explored. Most phase 2 trials are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Although larger numbers of subjects are evaluated, phase 2 trials still lack statistical power to detect events that occur in a low proportion of subjects. Initial phase 2 trials are usually conducted among persons who are at low risk for acquiring the target disease; therefore, additional phase 1 and phase 2 trials may be necessary to assess safety and immunogenicity among populations who are at high risk for the disease, in which pivotal efficacy trials will be conducted. For several emerging and neglected diseases, the preliminary efficacy of a vaccine can be assessed in a human challenge model, including malaria, influenza, and cholera ( Couch et al., 1971 ; Epstein et al., 2007 ; Tacket et al., 1999 ) . These carefully controlled experimental inoculations of subjects with the target pathogen can provide proof of concept that immunization with a vaccine candidate confers protection prior to large phase 3 clinical trials. In the pediatric population, rechallenge of vaccinated subjects with homologous or related live attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIV) provided supportive evidence that intranasal immunization with LAIV would confer protection against subsequent infection with wild-type influenza viruses ( Belshe et al., 2000 ) . Phase 2 trials may also incorporate plans to assess the endpoints in animals and humans are sufficiently well understood to permit selection of a regimen that would be expected to predict protection in humans. For other diseases where correlates of protection are reasonably well defined (for example, serum HAI antibody level against influenza viruses), surrogate markers can be used to support licensure ( FDA, 2007a ) . Finally, in order to facilitate the approval of vaccines for such severe, life-threatening illnesses, additional mechanisms for expedited review and accelerated approval have been developed by the FDA.",

For clinical trials of candidate vaccines, the study design typically is a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial -one example of a parallel group design. Phase 1 safety and tolerability studies often utilize a titration design, where ascending dosages of the experimental agent are sequentially administered to new cohorts of subjects ( Gorse et al., 2006 ) . Cluster-randomized clinical trial design is occasionally employed to assess vaccine efficacy. In this circumstance, larger groups of individuals (such as nursing homes or schools) are randomized to an intervention, rather than individual subjects, and the clinical endpoints are ascertained for vaccinated subjects ( Rodrigues et al., 2005 ) , or for a subset of the cluster, such as the contacts of healthcare workers in a closed setting ( Hayward et al., 2006 ) . Phase 1 clinical trials historically were open-label; however, in recent years most phase 1 clinical trials of vaccines have been randomized and blinded. The value of a placebo control in clinical trials has been described; however, a licensed control vaccine may be used rather than a placebo, particularly for phase 3 clinical trials in children. In a recent phase 3 clinical trial of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in infants, a meningococcal type C vaccine health status, ability to provide informed consent, etc.) of potentially eligible persons (Inclusion Criteria) and factors that would render an individual ineligible (Exclusion Criteria) should be explicitly enumerated. For some phase 1 trials, screening for eligibility may include medical history, physical examination, and laboratory screening for evidence of good health (normal hematologic and biochemical parameters, and no evidence of active hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection). Information regarding serosusceptibility to the candidate pathogen may be necessary. For example, a phase 1 clinical trial of a dengue virus vaccine may require evidence of no prior infections caused by these viruses ( Edelman et al., 2003 ) , and a phase 1 or 2 clinical trial assessing the immunogenicity of LAIV may focus on persons with low or absent levels of preexisting immunity to the candidate vaccine ( Keitel et al., 1993b ) . For phase 3 clinical trials, it is necessary to identify a population in which the infection or disease occurs at a high enough frequency to assess the ability of a vaccine to protect.

For many phase 1 clinical trials, use of prescription medications is not permitted. Clinical trials of vaccines that potentially could be transmitted to others in the community raise special concerns. Recent reevaluations of smallpox vaccines posed concerns with regard to transmission of the vaccine virus from subjects to their contacts ( Frey et al., 2002 ) .

For most phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials of vaccines, the subjects are randomized to receive one of several dosage levels of vaccine or placebo. Ideally, randomization should not occur until the subjects have been qualified for participation. Typically the randomization occurs in blocks of a prespecified number that represents a multiple of the number of test articles. For example, if there were four dosage levels of vaccine and a placebo, then the block size might be 5, 10, or 15. If the block size chosen were 5, then the subjects would be randomized 1:1:1:1:1. Block randomization can reduce the risk of unequal group sizes. In some circumstances the probability of receiving one product differs from the probability of receiving another. For example, in an efficacy study to be conducted in children, an investigator may wish to reduce the number of subjects randomized to receive the placebo, and the randomization scheme selected may be 2:1 (vaccine:placebo). The vaccine group assignments for subjects should be concealed from the subjects and from investigators to reduce bias in the assessments performed after vaccination (so-called double blinding). Additional measures can be taken to reduce the potential for imbalances in baseline characteristics of enrolled subjects, such as stratification of subjects according to age, prior receipt of a related vaccine, etc., prior to randomization.",

SAEs include death, life-threatening events, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomalies, and events that result in permanent disability. Each AE and SAE that is recorded should be assessed for its severity and relationship to vaccination. The grading of AEs is usually based on the interference with activity, where 1 \u03ed mild, does not interfere with usual activities; 2 \u03ed moderate, interferes somewhat with usual activities; and 3 \u03ed severe, incapacitating. The severity grading system of laboratory abnormalities should be established before the initiation of the trial.

For larger, multicenter trials, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of site ISMs and individuals with clinical and statistical expertize relevant to the protocol is constituted to review study progress and advise immunization. The intensity of study assessments will vary according to the nature of the study product: more frequent and detailed assessments would be indicated for novel products whose safety profile is undefined. Periodic collection of blood, nasal, fecal, or other samples to assess for the occurrence of toxicity, or to determine the frequency, magnitude, and/or duration of shedding of a live vaccine candidate may also be indicated ( Piedra et al., 1993 ; Taylor et al., 1997 ) . These laboratory assessments should be tailored to the particular needs of the protocol, and should be based on the pathogenesis of the disease, the vaccine under evaluation, and information collected in the pre-IND stage.

For phase 3 trials, clinical follow-up is specifically targeted at ascertaining whether the vaccine prevents infection or disease and capturing the occurrence of SAEs; however, limited prospective safety assessments may be included (perhaps only in a subset of subjects) to expand the safety database ( Oxman et al., 2005 ) .",
