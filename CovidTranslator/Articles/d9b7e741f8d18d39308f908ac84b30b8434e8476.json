This study reports on the infectivity to phlebotomine sandflies (Lutzomyia longipalpis) of serologically positive mongrel dogs that differed in clinical status, haematology and humoral responses to immunoglobulin (Ig) G T (total anti-Leishmania IgG), IgG 1 and IgG 2 subclasses of antibody to crude antigen of L. infantum. Forty-five female L. longipalpis were allowed to feed directly on the ears of dogs classified as asymptomatic, oligosymptomatic or symptomatic before being dissected five days later. Promastigotes were detected in 88% of the dissected sandflies. The highest rate of infectivity to sandflies was found in symptomatic dogs, followed by oligosymptomatic and asymptomatic animals. The results suggest that dogs naturally infected with L. infantum with higher total IgG and IgG 2 concentrations and lower haematocrit levels were able to infect the highest proportion of L. longipalpis. No correlation was observed between anaemia and the intensity of clinical signs. Symptomatic dogs presented the highest infection rate and intensity of infection.",

The possible causes of the anaemia are blood loss due to epistaxis and skin ulcerations, haemolysis, generalised inflammation, renal insufficiency and bone marrow hypoplasia or aplasia (Anosa and Idowu, 1983; Slappendel and Greene, 1990; Koutinas et al., 1999) .",

Using serial xenodiagnosis to assess the infectivity of dogs naturally infected with L. infantum, Travi et al. (2001) showed that asymptomatic individuals were unable to infect L. longipalpis females, while oligosymptomatic animals were infective at very low rates. On the other hand, symptomatic animals were able to infect large numbers of females at a very high intensity. These authors also showed the skin of the ear to be more heavily parasitised than that of the abdomen. Courtenay et al.

On the other hand, differences in infection rates when sandflies were fed on oligosymptomatic and symptomatic dogs have been found by others (Travi et al., 2001 (Travi et al., , 2002 , although asymptomatic dogs from these experiments were not able to infect the insects. Although Travi et al. (2001 Travi et al.

It has been demonstrated here that dogs with more clinical signs presented higher levels of total IgG and IgG 2 and were able to infect large numbers of female sandflies. From these observations it can be surmised that dogs with higher antibody levels are able to infect more sandflies. This conclusion addresses a crucial epidemiological question, linking these two parameters and supporting the findings of Courtenay et al. (2001) who observed that female sandflies can be infected by dogs only after they show antibodies in their sera; they considered antibody titres to be the best predictor of infectivity.",

The non-regenerative feature of the anaemia can be attributed to infection of the bone marrow by L. infantum, inducing infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages that could contribute to a decrease in erythrocyte production. The elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels encountered in most of the animals (data not shown) could also contribute to the anaemia, as this would alter erythropoietin function and reduce erythrocyte life span by its toxic action. More studies are needed to examine further the pathology of anaemia in canine VL.",

The high number of dogs presenting with normal leucocyte counts, as well as the absence of relationships between clinical category and the counts of total leucocytes (or subcategories of leucocytes) showed that the disease has little influence on this parameter. On the other hand, lymphocyte counts do appear to be influenced by the disease, as lymphocytopenia increased in severity with manifestation of clinical disease.
