This retrospective study aims to introduce the system, and to utilize the data collected for further investigation of the lifespan and mortality of the domesticated cat population stratified by demographic variables. Our data revealed that 1325 domesticated cats were acquired between 2012 and 2014. The median age of the study population was 8.0 years (IQR 3.0-13.0; range 0.0-22.7). Neutered and purebred cats lived longer. The most common causes of death were renal and urologic disorders, followed by neoplasia, infection, cardiovascular disorders, and trauma. Independent factors for common causes were surveyed. Advanced age and neutering was found to be associated with death due to renal and urologic disorders as well as with neoplasia. In contrast, younger age was found to be associated with death due to trauma and infection; being unneutered and living in the capital city were found to be associated with death due to trauma. Being male or purebred was found to be associated with death due to cardiovascular disorders.",

To recruit veterinary clinics, the investigators attended regular meetings of regional veterinary medical associations where the system was introduced to the clinicians. Interested owners of veterinary clinics could voluntarily join the program by signing a contract; thereafter, they received specific permission for use of the website, instruction on use of the system, and technical support if needed. Only legally registered veterinary clinics with more than three licensed veterinarians qualified for use of the program. These veterinary clinics tended to offer full service and give more accurate diagnoses.",

The owner's personal information, which included name, address and telephone number, was used to avoid duplicate or fake entries. The information regarding the animal's natural death or regarding euthanasia included a case brief, clinical diagnosis, date of death, COD/RFE, and whether or not the animal was euthanized.

Demographic variables evaluated included biological meaningful and death-related factors. Biological meaningful factors included age, breed, sex, neuter status and whether or not the cat lived in the capital city. To study the difference between mixed (domestic shorthair) and purebred cats, the designated variable was whether the cat was purebred. Geographic information were accessed based on the owner's address, which also represented the place where the cats lived. In Taiwan, there are huge differences in human population density and lifestyle between the capital, Taipei City, and other cities. This may be linked to the different lifestyles of the pet cats. In view of this, the variable of whether or not the cat lived in the capital city was applied to the current study in order to clarify the relationship between CODs/RFEs and the location of the cats. Death-related factors included the option for euthanasia and date of death. The option for euthanasia referred to whether or not the animal was chosen to be euthanized.

Multivariable logistic regression models considering demographic factors were also performed to examine relevance among the factors.

This is in accordance with the Swedish study (Egenvall et al., 2009 ). This may be related to insufficient water intake and a preference for feeding a dry diet in Taiwan. This has been suggested as an important cause of the development of feline lower urinary tract disease and the progression of feline chronic kidney disease (Elliott and Barber, 1998; Carciofi et al., 2005; Dru Forrester and Roudebush, 2007; White et al., 2011) . In both univariable and multivariable logistic regression models, death due to renal and urologic disorders was associated with increased age and neuter status (higher in neutered cats), which has been broadly discussed in previous studies. Regarding feline chronic kidney diseases and lower urinary tract diseases, old age is a generally accepted risk factor, while breed predispositions have been variously observed (Buffington et al., 2006; White et al., 2011) . It has been observed that the presence of feline lower urinary tract disease is associated with chronic kidney diseases (Mayer-Roenne et al., 2007; White et al., 2013) . Because our reporting system was open with minimal interference in the clinicians' opinions, we found that sometimes urologic disorders could not be separated from renal disorders based on the submitted information. Therefore, urologic and renal disorders were grouped together, and this may constitute a limitation. The interaction between the neuter Table 6 Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis of demographic variables associated with the five most common attributed causes in domesticated cats collected from the real-time system during 2012-2014 in Taiwan. In the logistic regression model for neoplasia-attributed deaths, independent variables were age, sex, neuter status and option for euthanasia initially. However, sex became non-significant when reproductive tumors were excluded. This finding was consistent with the current knowledge that feline mammary gland tumors are frequently associated with a poor prognosis in females (Seixas et al., 2011) . Sterilization in cats was observed to contribute to an increased risk of dying from neoplasia, irrespective of whether reproductive tumors were considered. The interaction between age and neuter status was confirmed in the study population, which may also be associated with many possible reasons and should be considered. To date, no studies have reviewed the association between gonadectomy and increased risk of developing neoplasia in cats; further investigation is needed.",

The difference may be related to how the owners perceive their pets, how the veterinarians suggest for specific diseases, different cost and different animal welfare strategies between the countries. In addition, strong correlations were noticed between the variables of whether the cat/owner was from the capital city and neuter status, option for euthanasia, and neoplasia as attributing causes. The difference between countries and correlations among geographic variables suggests that spatial variations may be related to differ-ent philosophies in veterinary practice, animal welfare issues, cost concerns, and other decision-making issues.

In severe cases, cats appear to have died from neural disorders (Chang et al., 2016) .

Similar to our system, the two English systems also targeted domesticated animals frequenting primary care veterinary hospitals and also utilized nationwide, veterinarian-based, web-based data from veterinary hospitals. However, VetCompass and SAVSNET were similar to an electronic medical records system that could access the complete data on both living and deceased animals. Furthermore, SAVSNET also collected real-time data from veterinary diagnostic laboratories, which realized the purpose of real-time disease surveillance. With many more variables, these studies had a greater capacity for morbidity and mortality research.",

Secondly, a reporting bias may have been created because of variations among veterinarians and veterinary hospitals, the accuracy of the diagnosis (which may be influenced by many factors), and whether each veterinary hospital submitted all of their decreased animals to the database.",
