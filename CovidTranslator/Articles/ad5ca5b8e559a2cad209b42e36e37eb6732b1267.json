While coronaviruses have been studied extensively morphologically, they have not been well-characterized chemically. Using the murine coronavirus A59, an analysis of coronavirus proteins was undertaken in this laboratory to identify the structural and functional roles of each component of the virion. Evidence will be presented that one of the structural proteins is located entirely within the core of the virion, while the others are associated with the viral envelope. Although six species are consistently resolved under the usual conditions of gel electrophoresis, our studies suggest that several of these species are different forms of the same molecule. There appear to be four size classes of structural proteins which have been designated GP180, GP90, VP50, and GP23. GP23 will be shown to exhibit anomalous behavior in SDS-polyacrylamide gels which gives rise to the appearance of additional species. The effect of the conditions of preparation, heating and reducing agents, on the electrophoretic migration of this protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels will be analyzed.",

Samples were solubilized in a buffer which contained, in final concentrations, 0.060 M Tris-phosphate (pH 6.7), 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 5% p-mercaptoethanol (/3-MSH), and 0.001% bromphenol blue (BPB), and the mixtures were heated for 1.54 min at 100\". In some cases boiled samples were stored at 4\" or -20\" for several days and reboiled for 1.5 min before being placed on gels. Subsequently the amount and type of reducing agent and the conditions of heating were varied as indicated. The volume of the spacer gel was 1.2-2 times that of the sample; the 10% resolving gel was 20 cm long. Electrophoresis was carried out at 50 V for 22-26 hr. For estimation of molecular weights, gels containing reference proteins were fixed and stained at room temperature for I hr in a solution containing 2.50 g of Coomassie brilliant blue G250 (Diezel et al., 19721,454 ml of methanol, and 95 ml of glacial acetic acid per liter. Diffusion destaining was accomplished by incubating stained gels at 37\" in 7.5% acetic acid-5% methanol with AG501-X8 Bio-Rad ion exchange resin, 4 g/20 cm of gel. Apparent molecular weights were determined according to Weber and Osborn (1975) . The reference proteins used were p-galactosidase (130,000), ovalbumen (43,000), trypsin (23,000), cytochrome c (11,700), and E. coli RNA polymerase (165,000, 89,000, and 39,000) . For liquid scintillation spectrometry, the gels were crushed in l-or 2-mm portions on the Gilson automatic linear gel fractionator (Gilson et al., 19721 and collected in scintillation vials in a stream of water. In some cases the gel was fractionated from top to bottom, in the reverse direction as it is usually performed with this apparatus. When fractionation began at the top, the spacer gel was placed in the first vial. The water was evaporated at 60 and each vial was filled with10 ml of scintillation mixture composed of 102 ml of NCS-water (5.5:1), 160 ml of Liquifluor, and 3683 ml (1 gal minus 102 ml) of toluene (Kiehn and Holland, 1970) . The filled vials were incubated at 37\" overnight and counted in a Beckman LS 250 liquid scintillation spectrometer.",

Alkylation under these conditions resulted in the formation of aggregates of GP90 and GP180 (unpublished data, see discussion). Therefore another approach was taken: the conditions of preparation of the sample for SDS-PAGE were varied, and the effects were analyzed. As a result, the electrophoretic profile of coronavirus A59 viral proteins was found to be highly dependent upon the conditions employed for preparation. The effects of heat and reducing agents on the PAGE pattern of coronavirus proteins are shown in the following experiments. If the viral proteins were solubilized in SDS at 25\", without /3-MSH or dithiothreitol (DTT), only four polypeptide species were seen on PAGE: GP23, VP50, GP90, and GP180 (Fig. 4A) . The same pattern was obtained when the sample was dissolved in SDS at 37\" in the presence of 5% (749 r&4) &MSH (data not shown). Heating the sample at 100\" in the absence of P-MSH or DTT resulted in the appearance of GP38 and GP60, and a concomitant reduction in the amount of GP23 (Fig. 4B) . A diffuse increase in the amount of label retained in the upper portion of the gel was also apparent. In this experiment the polypeptides were labeled with [35Slmethionine to accentuate GP23. GP23 is threefold more highly labeled by methionine than VP50.",

The SDS-gel electrophoresis experiments described thus far were performed in the high pH-discontinuous buffer system popularized by Laemmli. The procedure which Laemmli employed involved heating the sample at 100\" for 1.5 min in the presence of 5% P-MSH before placing it on the gel. The effects of boiling and /3-MSH upon the migration of GP23 were also investigated in neutral pH-continuous buffer phosphate gels and phosphate gels with urea. In both of these systems, as in the high pH-discontinuous buffer system, only four polypeptide species were found as long as the samples were prepared at 25\" (Fig. 6A,C) . Heating at 100\" and addition of /3-MSH both in the presence and absence of urea resulted in a reduction in the amount of GP23 and the appearance of slower migrating species (Fig. 6B,D) . Thus, GP23 may give rise to several species of apparently larger size on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, including GP38 and GP60, depending upon the conditions employed in the preparation of the sample, regardless of the pH (7.2 or 9.51, buffer ion (phosphate or glycine), or presence of urea.",

While there are many differences among the results reported in these studies, some of the findings are in agreement. In all of the investigations a major polypeptide, approximately 50,000 in weight, was identified and was unaffected by bromelain treatment of intact virions. Also in three cases, a very large species, 180,000-200,000 in weight, was found. In addition each laboratory identified from two to six species intermediate in size and from two to eight polypeptides smaller than 50,600. It is highly doubtful that the great variation in numbers and sizes of coronavirus proteins reported previously is due to dissimilarities between coronavirus strains or hostrelated differences. Two of the factors producing erroneous results may have been contamination by host proteins, where polypeptides were analyzed by staining alone, and artifacts produced as a result of heating with P-MSH in sample preparation.",
