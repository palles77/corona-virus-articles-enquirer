            "text": "In a 5-year survey regarding its prevalence and importance in five German state veterinary laboratories Cryptosporidium was diagnosed annually in 19-36% of faecal samples either submitted to the laboratories or taken post mortem. In approximately half of the cases no other enteropathogens were detected. However, only 73% of 30 laboratories participating in a questionnaire survey routinely tested for this parasite, and the majority of researchers considered cryptosporidiosis to be of minor importance. In a placebo-controlled field study 152 suckling calves were treated daily against cryptosporidiosis either with sulfadimidine or with halofuginone (Halocur \u00ae , Intervet) over 1 week. Treatment by oral drench started at the onset of diarrhoea in the herd. Oocyst excretion, faecal consistency and health status were recorded five times for a 3-week period. Oocyst excretion peaked 7-14 days in the placebo group after the onset of diarrhoea, and during that period prevalence and intensity of excretion were significantly lower in the halofuginone-treated group compared to the sulfadimidine and the placebo control groups. The health status (diarrhoea, dehydration) declined in all groups but was significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) better in the halofuginone group in the first 2 weeks. Halofuginone effectively (P < 0.05-0.001) reduced oocyst excretion and improved the health status of the treated animals, while sulfadimidine had no effect against Cryptosporidium.",

Animals are infected by oocysts from their environment and show clinical signs of disease (pasty to watery diarrhoea with dehydration) within a few days after infection which can last up to 2 weeks (Rommel, 2000) . The large numbers of oocysts that are excreted together with the strong resistance of the exogenous stages against disinfection (Blewett, 1989; Fayer et al., 1996) can turn this parasite into a perpetual threat to animal health and productivity on affected farms. The parasite is found worldwide with prevalences in young calves of 20-40% in different European countries (Anon., 1996; Lentze et al., 1999 ; see Chermette and Boufassa-Ouzrout, 1988; de Graaf et al., 1999) . Apart from the veterinary problems that Cryptosporidium can cause, it has the potential to cause zoonotic disease, especially in immunocompromised humans (Fayer et al., 2000; Slifko et al., 2000) . In the present study we evaluated the prevalence of cryptosporidia in samples examined at veterinary laboratories and the estimation of investigators regarding the importance of this parasite. In a field trial the efficacy of sulfadimidine and halofuginone against cryptosporidiosis was tested.",

The evaluation included records of diarrhoea and/or enteritis in calves tested for Cryptosporidium. All five laboratories routinely tested for the parasite at post mortem examinations of calves up to 4 weeks of age with diarrhoea and in all faecal samples from calves submitted for post mortem examination. Parasitological examination was based on the staining method of direct smears according to Heine (1982) , Pohlenz et al. (1978) or Henriksen and Pohlenz (1981) with semi-quantitative estimation of the intensity. In one case samples were examined using a coproantigen ELISA (Digestiv ELISA Kit \u00ae ; Bio-X, Belgium).

This shows the prevalence of this parasite is probably underestimated-only 2/3 of the laboratories included the parasite in their routine testing and considered it to be common; only 26% of the investigators estimated the prevalence to be more than 20%. The role of cryptosporidia as a primary cause of diarrhoea was acknowledged by only 1/5 of the investigators. The bias of samples submitted to the state laboratories does not allow direct comparison between field investigations and our retrospective evaluation. However, the examination of field samples from different parts of Germany shows that the prevalence of cryptosporidia in calves (up to the age of 6 months) ranges mostly from 20 to 30%, with 35-36% monoinfections (Heine and Boch, 1981; Stein et al., 1983; Fiedler, 1985; Schulz et al., 1989) . Considering the fact that C. parvum is most prevalent in calves up to 4 weeks of age (Krogh and Henriksen, 1985; Schulz et al., 1989; de Graaf et al., 1999) this age group probably has considerably higher prevalences. The present data indicate that although cryptosporidia are acknowledged as primary pathogens (Pohlenz et al., 1978; Stein et al., 1983; Krogh and Henriksen, 1985; de Graaf et al., 1999) , not all veterinarians seem to be aware of their prevalence and importance.",

In contrast, daily application of Halocur \u00ae in a dose of 7-9 ml/animal for 1 week significantly reduced oocyst excretion and diarrhoea. Under experimental conditions, halofuginone could completely prevent parasite shedding Peeters et al., 1993) . In our study a metaphylactic application was chosen with the aim to reduce clinical signs of cryptosporidiosis and excretion of oocysts. A therapeutic application is also possible . Although halofuginone could not completely prevent infections under field conditions, it is the only effective drug currently available for the treatment of bovine cryptosporidiosis, and although it is known to be relatively toxic and requires exact dosages, the application by the farmers according to our instructions was save in our study.",

Treatment is recommended to reduce disease and contamination of the environment with infective oocysts. However, contamination of the environment cannot be completely prevented with the currently available drugs. It should therefore be emphasised that effective long-term control of the parasite can only be achieved by integrated management including hygienic measures such as regular cleaning and disinfection, e.g. with Neopredisan \u00a9 (25% chlorocresole, Menno Chemie, Norderstedt, Germany) which also controls other enteropathogens, separation of excreters and the economical use of drugs in combination with other measures are mandatory to prevent the development of resistance.",
