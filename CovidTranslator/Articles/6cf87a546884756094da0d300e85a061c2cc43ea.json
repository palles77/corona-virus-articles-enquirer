This study aimed to reveal the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children. Method: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical symptoms, laboratory results, chest CT, and treatment of children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19(ie, with samples that were positive for 2019 novel coronavirus[2019-nCoV]) who were admitted to Result: Nine patients had no obvious clinical symptom. 11 patients developed fever. Other symptoms, including cough(in eleven of seventeen patients), rhinorrhea(in two), diarrhea(in two), vomiting(in two), were also observed. A small minority of patients had lymphocytopenia. Alanine transaminase or transaminase increased in three cases. According to chest CT scan, 11 patients showed unilateral pneumonia, 8 patients had no pulmonary infiltration. No serious complications such as acute respiratory syndrome and acute lung injury occurred in all patients. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children were different from adult. The overall condition of children were mild and have a good prognosis.",

In this study, the prognosis of children with COVID-19 was good, and the prognosis was different from that of middle-aged and elderly patients in other studies. Consider that the difference was related to thymic immune function. In the treatment of SARS patients, drugs such as glucocorticoids and thymosin were used [7] . Although there was no clinical evidence to support the use of glucocorticoids [8] , whether early use of thymosin and gamma globulin for immunomodulation in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 can reduce cytokine storms, reduce clinical symptoms and improve prognosis requires further exploration.",

This might also indicate that 2019-ncov produces a series of immune responses in the body through the respiratory mucosa, and children's lymphocytes had not significantly decreased, thus failing to induce a cytokine storm. Chen N et al.[3] studied the imaging characteristics of 99 adult 2019-CoV pneumonia patients in Wuhan area and found that 75% of patients had double pneumonia, and the remaining 25% of patients had single pneumonia. We found that 8 of the 26 children did not have pneumonia, 7 (about 27%) had bilateral pulmonary infiltration, and 11 (about 42%) had unilateral pulmonary infiltration. It can be seen that the CT manifestations of children are quite different from that of adults, and complications such as ARDS have not been found in children in China so far, which can indirectly reflect that children are not easy to induce not prone to induce cytokine storms.",
