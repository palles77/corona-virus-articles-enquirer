Licorice is a common ingredient of several prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine which have been proved to inhibit infection of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). There are two preparations of licorice, Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata. However, it is unknown whether licorice or which preparation of licorice is effective against HRSV, nor is its active constituent. Aim of the study: We tested the hypothesis that Radix Glycyrrhizae can effectively decrease HRSVinduced plaque formation in respiratory mucosal cell lines. We also tried to find out the active constituent. Materials and methods: Anti-HRSV activities of hot water extracts of preparations of licorice, glycyrrhizin and 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (18\u03b2-GA), the active constituents of licorice, were examined by plaque reduction assay in both human upper (HEp-2) and low (A549) respiratory tract cell lines. Abilities of crude licorice to inhibit viral replication and to stimulate IFN-\u03b2 were evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Results: Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata dose-dependently inhibited HRSV-induced plaque formation in both HEp-2 and A549 cell lines (po 0.0001). The effect of Radix Glycyrrhizae was better than that of Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata on HEp-2 cells. However, there was no difference of their anti-HRSV effects on A549 cells. Besides, glycyrrhizin was ineffective at all. Nevertheless, 18\u03b2-GA showed a potent anti-HRSV activity. Radix Glycyrrhizae was more effective when given before viral inoculation (po 0.0001) which may be due to its inhibition of viral attachment on (po 0.0001) and penetration (po 0.0001) into the host cells. The anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae was further confirmed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. 300 \u03bcg/ml Radix Glycyrrhizae markedly decreased the viral amounts within the cells and in the suspension. Radix Glycyrrhizae might further stimulate mucosal cells to secrete IFN-\u03b2 to counteract viral infection. Conclusions: Both Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata are effective against HRSV infection on airway epithelial cells. Radix Glycyrrhizae inhibited HRSV mainly by preventing viral attachment, internalization, and by stimulating IFN secretion. 18\u03b2-GA may be one of its active constituents.",

            "text": "Viral Bronchiolitis and pneumonia are the common low respiratory tract infection in infants and children under 2 years of age. Bronchiolitis could cause respiratory failure in infants and children (Abboud et al., 2012; Jat and Chawla, 2012) . Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), rather than the influenza A virus, is the most important cause of viral bronchiolitis (Macao et al., 2011) . Furthermore, HRSV is the major pathogen of viral pneumonia in children (Falade and Ayede, 2011) . The incidence of HRSV-induced pneumonia is six times more than that of influenza A virus in children under 5 years of age (Hatipoglu et al., 2011) . It has been estimated that more than 1.5 million children younger than 5 years old annually died of pneumonia worldwide (Maxwell et al., 2012) . Therefore, HRSV is the most common cause of hospitalization due to severe acute low respiratory infection in infant and children (Nair et al., 2010) . Ribavirin is an FDA-approved agent to manage HRSV infection. However, Ribavirin, with continuous inhalation for 20 h to get the therapeutic effect, is inconvenient to use (Shigeta, 2000) . Application of ribavirin is further limited by its side effects (De Franceschi et al., 2000; Empey et al., 2010) . Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend ribavirin to manage HRSV infection (Empey et al., 2010) . Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal IgG antibody against HRSV, effectively prevents HRSV infection. Nevertheless, it is expensive and ineffective to manage an established HRSV infection (Shadman and Wald, 2011) . Development of new anti-HRSV chemotherapies is urgently needed.",

            "text": "Licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.; Leguminosae) is a common ingredient in prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine. Ge-Gen-Tang (GGT; kakkon-to) (Chang et al., 2012a) , Liu-He-Tang (LHT) (Chang et al., 2011) , Sheng-Ma-Ge-Gen-Tang (SMGGT; Shoma-kakkon-to) (Wang et al., 2011b) are all Chinese traditional prescriptions for airway symptoms that have been proved to have anti-HRSV activity. These prescriptions contain Glycyrrhiza uralensis. Therefore, we hypothesized that Glycyrrhiza uralensis might be one of the active ingredients that accounts for their anti-HRSV activity. However, Glycyrrhiza uralensis is also the most common ingredient in numerous Chinese traditional prescriptions. Therefore, it might be a bystander that is co-incidentally present within these prescriptions. Besides, there are two preparations of Chinese licorice. One is crude licorice, Radix Glycyrrhizae, and the other is honey-burn processed licorice, Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata (Radix Glycyrrhizae Praeparata cum melle). Radix Glycyrrhizae has been used to manage various symptoms in different organ systems worldwide, including sore throat and infectious diseases (Fiore et al., 2008; Shi et al., 2012) . Extracts of Radix Glycyrrhizae and its active constituents have been reported to have anti-cancer activity (Seon et al., 2012) , organ-protective effect (Kim et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2011) , protection from heavy metal injury (Kim et al., 2008) , anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activity (Chin et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2011) . In vitro antiviral activities of Radix Glycyrrhizae have been reported against human immunodeficiency virus (Sasaki et al., 2002) , Japanese encephalitis virus (Badam, 1997) , EV71 (Kuo et al., 2009) , Rotavirus (Kwon et al., 2010) , SARS-associated coronavirus (Cinatl et al., 2003) , Epstein-Barr virus (Lin, 2003) , and Flaviviruses (Crance et al., 2003) . Its antiviral activity against HRSV has been reported in HeLa cells (Dong et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2006) . However, HeLa cells are not respiratory tract cells. The actual anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae has been questioned. In contrast, Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata is commonly used to manage weakness and palpitation. However, study of Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata is rare and its bioactivity is not fully understood. Bioactivity of a crude medicinal plant can be changed during preparation. For example, dried ginger is prepared from fresh ginger and loose its anti-HRSV activity during processing (Chang et al., 2012a) . Therefore, it was interesting to know whether Radix Glycyrrhizae or Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata has antiviral activity against HRSV. We used both human upper (HEp-2) and low (A549) respiratory tract cell lines to test the hypothesis that Radix Glycyrrhizae, but not Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata, could effectively inhibit plaque formation induced by HRSV infection. We also examined the anti-HRSV of its active constituents.",

Acetonitrile-0.1% phosphoric acid was selected as the mobile phase gradient elution. The HPLC fingerprint data showed the standard glycyrrhizin ammonium salt, retention time nearby 48 min, was one of the major constituents of licorice (Fig. S1 ). Our fingerprint was similar to that of the root of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. (Wang and Yang, 2007) . Furthermore, the content of liquiritin, retention time nearby 22 min, has been shown to be much less than those of glycyrrhizin in Glycyrrhiza glabra and Glycyrrhiza inflate (Rauchensteiner et al., 2005) . The HPLC fingerprint data ( Fig. S1 ) further confirm the air-dried root we used is not Glycyrrhiza glabra, nor G. inflate.",

Therefore, the anti-HRSV activity of licorice is not changed during the preparation process, in contrast to that of ginger whose anti-HRSV activity is lost during processing (Chang et al., 2012b) . Radix Glycyrrhizae has anti-HRSV activity with a better activity to inhibit viral attachment and internalization. This anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae was further confirmed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. Besides, Radix Glycyrrhizae of high concentration could stimulate the secretion of IFN-\u03b2 which has multiple anti-viral activities, including inhibition of viral penetration, un-coating, mRNA translation, protein synthesis, genome replication, virus assembly and releasing, to counteract viral infection (Sen, 2001) . HRSV causes mortality and morbidity mainly by the pathology of the low respiratory tract. Both Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata were effective against HRSV on the low airway mucosal cells to minimize the lung injury (Fig. 2a) . Therefore, our study supports the use of both Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata in certain prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine against HRSV infection. Radix Glycyrrhizae had a better effect on HEp-2 cell which is an upper airway mucosal cell line (Fig. 2a) . No wonder that Radix Glycyrrhizae, rather than Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata, is used to manage sore throat in the oriental for centuries. Radix Glycyrrhizae has been reported to inhibit HRSV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) on Hela cells (Dong et al., 2004 ) and HEp-2 cells (Ma et al., 2002) . HeLa cell is a cervical cell line so that it is not appropriate to exam the respiratory tract injury. Although the CPE effect of HRSV could be reduced by Radix Glycyrrhizae in HEp-2 cell (Ma et al., 2002) , direct microscopic examination of CPE is not the gold standard to study antiviral activity, whereas plaque reduction assay is. This study used plaque reduction assay to provide the valid results to support Radix Glycyrrhizae has anti-HRSV activity in both HEp-2 and A549 cells. Besides, by the plaque reduction assay, we clearly showed its mode of action. Also, our results showed a consistence between different assays and between different respiratory tract cell lines. Therefore, our study provides more solid evidence to support licorice has the anti-HRSV activity.",

            "text": "Glycyrrhizin, the major active constituent of Radix Glycyrrhizae, was not active against HRSV at all. 18\u03b2-GA is an active constituent of licorice and also the primary metabolite of glycyrrhizin converted by gut commensal bacteria (Hendricks et al., 2012) . 18\u03b2-GA was effective against HRSV-induced plaque formation (Fig. 2b) . Therefore, the anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae could be directly mediated by 18\u03b2-GA and could further be augmented through bacterial conversion of glycyrrhizin into 18\u03b2-GA in the gut. 18\u03b2-GA has been reported to have antiviral activity against rotavirus (Hardy et al., 2012) and Epstein-Barr virus (Lin et al., 2008) . This study demonstrates the first time that 18\u03b2-GA is also active against HRSV infection. 18\u03b2-GA has antiinflammatory activity through inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation to reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines (Wang et al., 2011a). Therefore, by inhibiting both HRSV and HRSV-induced inflammatory response, 18\u03b2-GA could be an active constituent mediating the in vivo anti-HRSV activity of licorice. Therefore, we suppose 18\u03b2-GA may be one of the active constituents accounting for the anti-HRSV activity of licorice. However, the antiviral mechanism of 18\u03b2-GA is still unclear. Many works are needed to be done in the future.",
