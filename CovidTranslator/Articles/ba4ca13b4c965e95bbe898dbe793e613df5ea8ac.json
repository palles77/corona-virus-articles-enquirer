This can occur either at a plenary meeting of ICTV, held during an International Congress of Virology conference, or by circulation of proposals by mail followed by a ballot. As in recent years, a list of proposals that had been subjected to the full, multistage review process was prepared and presented on the ICTVonline web pages by January 2012. This review process involved input from the ICTV study groups and subcommittees, other interested virologists, and the ICTV Executive Committee. These proposals were submitted to and discussed by the ICTV Executive Committee over the past two years and represent changes to virus taxonomy from that recently published in the Ninth Report [1] . The ratification process was performed entirely by email. The proposals were sent electronically via email on January 24 2012 to ICTV Executive Committee Members (18), Life Members (11), ICTV Subcommittee Members (105), and ICTV National Representatives (55). Members were then requested to vote on whether or not to ratify the taxonomic proposals, within a four-week deadline (voting closed on February 21, 2012).",

A number of suggestions were received during the voting process. These included requests to rationalize species demarcation criteria across virus families, to pay continued attention to clarity in naming new genera and to seek multiple species demarcation criteria so that new species are not created solely on the basis of a measure of nucleotide sequence identity. The ICTV continues to discuss these issues and welcomes comments on all taxonomic proposals as they are posted on the ICTV web site. The return rate of votes was approximately 48%. These taxonomic changes are now part of the official ICTV taxonomy and supplement the taxonomy presented in the Ninth ICTV Report published in 2011 [1] .
