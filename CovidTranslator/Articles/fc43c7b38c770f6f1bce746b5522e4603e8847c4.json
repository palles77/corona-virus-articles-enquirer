There is substantial overlap between the lists for the two models. For both models, the article count and the mortality, outbreak worsening and novelty indicators were among the most important features. The mortality indicator describes whether or not fatalities were reported during the week, the outbreak worsening indicator captures mentions of increasing cases or worsening conditions, and the novelty indicator measures whether the disease is described as new or unfamiliar. The finding that the novelty indicator was among the most important features is consistent with previous research that has shown that outbreaks of novel diseases are more likely to have associated social response (Fast et al, 2015; McGrath, 1991) .

Model performance was slightly diminished on the entire collection of countries compared with the 30 countries used for model specification and tuning.
