Medical Emergencies at 40,000 Feet INTRODUCTION It is estimated 2.75 billion people travel aboard commercial airlines every year and 44,000 in-flight medical emergencies occur worldwide each year. 1 Wilderness medicine requires a commonsense and improvisational approach to medical issues. A sudden call for assistance in the austere and unfamiliar surroundings of an airliner cabin may present the responding medical professional with a \"wilderness medicine\" experience. From resource management to equipment, this article sheds light on the unique conditions, challenges, and constraints of the flight environment.",

To allow passengers to survive and operate in this environment, the cabin must be pressurized. Despite pressurization, the internal cabin altitude is generally not maintained at sea level pressure because the aircraft structure required to maintain a sea level pressure would make the plane unacceptably heavy and expensive to build and operate. Thus, a compromise is made that is the most efficient for weight/strength/expense, while preventing passengers from becoming hypoxic. The aircraft cabin is typically pressurized between 6000 and 8000 feet above sea level. Newer aircraft, such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner, can pressurize the cabin to lower altitudes, equal to about 6000 feet, even in the upper flight levels. In the United States, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements allow a maximum cabin altitude of 8000 feet.",

The fractional oxygen content of the air in the cabin is the same as that at sea level, approximately 21%. What changes with increasing cabin altitude is the atmospheric pressure. At a typical cruising altitude, the atmospheric pressure in the cabin is decreased by about 25% to 30% and results in a similar decrease in the partial pressure of inspired oxygen. The lower partial pressure of oxygen in the aircraft cabin results in slight hypoxemia, with a corresponding decrease in oxygen saturation and a mild compensatory hyperventilation and tachycardia. Medical personnel responding to onboard medical events should not be surprised by decreases in arterial oxygen saturation in the range of 3% to 5%, even in healthy individuals.",

The surgical literature contains references regarding complications during flight subsequent to recent abdominal surgery. 3, 4 Travelers should be advised to check with their surgeon. The British Civil Aviation Authority publishes the following recommendations. 5 Travel should be avoided for 10 days following abdominal surgery. Following procedures, such as colonoscopy, where a large amount of gas has been introduced into the colon, it is advisable to avoid travel by air for 24 hours. It is advisable to avoid flying for approximately 24 hours after laparoscopic intervention, because of the residual CO 2 gas, which may be in the intra-abdominal cavity. Neurosurgical intervention may leave gas trapped within the skull, which may expand at altitude. It is therefore advisable to avoid air travel for approximately 7 days following this type of procedure. Ophthalmologic procedures for retinal detachment involve the introduction of gas by intraocular injections, which temporarily increase intraocular pressure. Depending on the gas, it may be necessary to delay travel for approximately 2 weeks if sulfur hexafluoride is used and 6 weeks pursuant to the use of perfluoropropane. For other intraocular procedures and penetrating eye injuries, 1 week should elapse before flying.",

Westward travel is associated with early evening sleepiness and predawn awakening at the travel destination. Travelers flying within the same time zone typically experience the fewest problems, such as nonspecific travel fatigue. Crossing more time zones or traveling eastward generally increases the time required for adaptation. After eastward flights, jet lag lasts for the number of days roughly equal to twothirds the number of time zones crossed; after westward flights, the number of days is roughly half the number of time zones. The intensity and duration of jet lag are related to the number of time zones crossed, the direction of travel, the ability to sleep while traveling, the availability and intensity of local circadian time cues at the destination, and individual differences in phase tolerance.",

The medications that must be carried in all EMKs have an expiration date of approximately 1 year. The FAA advises that the best practice is to replace all of the medications annually. In 1994, examination gloves were added to the medical kits. In 2004, an updated kit, the enhanced EMK, was added to the requirement. The enhanced EMK added oral antihistamines, nonnarcotic analgesics, a bronchodilator, aspirin, injectable atropine, additional epinephrine, IV lidocaine, IV saline, and a bag valve mask. An AED was also required. FAA regulations state that a flight may not depart if it is missing the EMK or AED. By regulation, flight attendants may only use the equipment and medications under the direction of a licensed medical provider. For minor medical issues, flight attendants may use a simple \"first aid\" kit that is stowed separately without consulting a medical professional. The contents of an aircraft first-aid kit typically include 13 Antiseptic swabs (10/packs) Bandage adhesive strips Bandage, gauze 7.5 cm \u00c2 4.5 cm Thermometer (nonmercury) Resuscitation mask with one-way valve First-aid manual (an operator may decide to have one manual per aircraft in an easily accessible location) Incident record form If the medical professional needs the kit, the flight attendant will procure it. The standard EMK may not be available on international flights with non-US carriers. The International Air Transport Association endorses the Aerospace Medical Association's recommendations, but does not regulate the contents of EMKs of international airlines. 35",

If one considers the 20 to 30 minutes required for an emergency landing from cruising altitude, plus a 10-minute taxi time to the gate, it is clear that in the past, these patients rarely survived. The successful introduction of AEDs for use by personal outside of hospitals has resulted in vastly improved ventricular fibrillation survival rates. 36 These data have prompted many international airline organizations to introduce AEDs into their aircraft fleet. The FAA made it mandatory for all US-based commercial passenger aircraft with at least one flight attendant to carry on AEDs since 2001. 37 If an AED is on board, typically at least one cabin crew member will be trained in its use. Airline protocol requires a crewmember to manage the AED and assist or direct its use. If cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is indicated, begin CPR and ask the cabin crew to assist. One can expect that all cabin crew have been trained in basic CPR. Some on-board AEDs include an electrocardiographic display (monitor) that shows the cardiac rhythm. AEDs with monitoring capability are clinically useful because they allow better decision making when a passenger presents with chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or lightheadedness. 27, 38 For monitoring only, a new device, the Tempus IC (Remote Diagnostic Technologies, Hampshire, United Kingdom), may be used by people with little or no medical training. It can monitor blood pressure, tympanic temperature, glucometry, oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry, respiration and breath gas analysis, and electrocardiogram, and transmit these data to a remote physician for diagnosis. 39 It is being adopted by a few airlines at this time. A compact smart phone transducer, Kardia (AliveCor), is now available. The device allows monitoring of electrocardiogram when used in conjunction with a smart phone. Kardia's single lead electrocardiogram is comparable with Lead 1 of a standard electrocardiogram machines. 40",

            "text": "The isolated environment and unavailability of specialized equipment can make for a challenging experience. Maintaining a calm, competent, and professional demeanor can go a long way toward creating a less stressful environment for the patient, crew, and other airline passengers. Medical professionals should respond to a call only if they are a licensed, currently practicing medical provider. Be prepared to show a form of professional identification (eg, a medical license) that verifies your training. Do not respond if you have been drinking alcohol. If you have been drinking (eg, one drink) and no other provider responds, be sure to offer full disclosure to the flight crew and the patient. It is appropriate to ask the patient for consent before commencing in-flight care if they are not altered. This is generally best done with a crewmember as witness. 43 Ask for one flight attendant to continue assisting throughout the in-flight emergency. This helps to maintain continuity and ensures that you have access to needed equipment and cockpit communications. If the passenger seems to be severely ill, request ground-based consultation. On all US carriers and most international carriers you will have access to a groundbased consultant that greatly eases the pressure on any in-flight medical volunteer. You may legally speak to the flight crew about the medical issues. 29 The airline is not required to follow federal regulations regarding health care privacy, because airlines are not considered to be a covered entity as defined by HIPAA. History taking may be difficult because of language barriers. Family members or another available passenger may act as an interpreter. The flight crew may not offer this, and it may be up to you to request this via a simple cabin announcement. Obtain and record vital signs early in the event. Physical examination can be extremely limited because of limitations in space, vibration, and ambient cabin noise. Auscultation of the heart, lungs, or abdomen may be virtually impossible. Better conditions for the evaluation and care of a passenger may necessitate moving the patient to an open area, such as an aft galley. If a full resuscitation is indicated, such as bag mask ventilation or AED defibrillation, this can only be done with the patient moved to a larger area. Treating a patient in the aisle should be avoided when possible because it impedes normal flight crew operations. You may be able to find additional medical equipment from other passengers. For example, in the case of a suspected hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic emergency, ask the flight attendant to announce that you are in need of a glucometer, which a passenger with diabetes might have on board. Do not be afraid to request additional help. A common example might be a physician out of practice starting IV lines requesting an announcement for a nurse or emergency medical technician with IV skills. You should be ready to defer to Donner other providers who may have more experience delivering care in acute situations (ie, an office-based dermatologist deferring to an emergency physician). Do not to perform procedures that you are unfamiliar with. If the patient's presentation suggests a communicable disease, be sure to notify the cabin and/or flight crew. If you are presented with a \"Do Not Resuscitate\" order by an accompanying family member or friend, you need to make a decision on how to proceed. The cabin crew may decide to continue resuscitation if their company policy requires it, despite the Do Not Resuscitate order. 13 ",

Do not confuse these settings with \"low\" and \"high\" flow used in most emergency departments and hospitals, where high flow implies 10 to 15 L per minute (or higher). The so-called \"high flow\" setting on aviation POBs is therefore considerably lower than what is normally used in EMS settings. Alternatively, some airline POBs are adjustable between 2 and 8 L per minute.",
