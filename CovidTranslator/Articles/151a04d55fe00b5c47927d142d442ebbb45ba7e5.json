Rhinoviruses are consistently the most frequent virus types detected, found in around two-thirds of cases where a virus is identified. The exact mechanism through which virus infection triggers exacerbations of airway disease is still unclear, but is likely to represent a constellation of host immune responses and specific viral actions. Infection of respiratory epithelium leads to a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines which recruit and activate immune cells in the airway.

Asthma exacerbations in children peak around mid to late September strongly correlating with return to school [17] . A peak in COPD exacerbations follows in December which is associated with the Christmas holiday season and is seen in every northern hemisphere country studied [17] . These trends reflect a complex combination of many causative factors; but the primary cause of exacerbations is respiratory virus infection particularly with rhinovirus.

Viruses, such as influenza, may be highly pathogenic and cause excessive epithelial cell necrosis and inflammation. However even rhinoviruses with milder pathogenicity, and less direct cellular necrosis, can lead to a marked symptomatic host response. A virus infected epithelial cell releases a wide range of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, TNF-a, IL-6 IL-8, GRO-a, IL-11, RANTES, GM-CSF and eotaxin. In addition the expression of growth factors, adhesion molecules and immunity related molecules is up-regulated by virus infection [19] . A recent longitudinal study of exacerbations in severe asthmatics identified increases in IL-13 and IFN-g producing T-cells during exacerbations; the deficiency of regulatory T cells found at baseline was also exaggerated during exacerbations [20] . This study offers new insight into the pathophysiology of asthma exacerbations, and although viruses were not investigated in this study future work should explore their role in these cellular changes.",

Further study in RSV infected mice again found elevated substance P levels, but also falls in the airway protective compound calcitonin gene-related peptide CGRP [23] .

In vivo rhinovirus infection has been shown to induce MUC5AC levels in BAL and in vitro studies demonstrated that this occurs as a result of new mRNA synthesis. The signalling pathway has been characterised in detail and the transcription factors NF-kB and SP-1 were shown to be involved. Following RV infection NF-kB is activated and matrix metalloproteinase mediated release of transforming growth factor (TGF) occurs. This in turn activates the epidermal growth factor receptor leading to activation of protein kinase signalling (MAPK, MEK and ERK).

Major group rhinoviruses (90% of serotypes) bind to the human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as their cellular receptor. However they are unable to bind to mouse ICAM-1. The recent generation of a mouse-human ICAM-1 chimera has enabled a mouse model of rhinovirus infection to be created [39] . In addition the model included sensitisation and subsequent re-challenge with ovalbumen to create features of atopy, which in combination with rhinovirus infection provides a model for asthma exacerbations. In the absence of coughing in mice AHR would have to be used as surrogate for cough, however guinea pigs, which are able to cough, may prove a more useful model in the future. Sendai and RSV infection are established in guinea pigs but RV infection has not presently been attempted.

Therefore more objective assessments of cough monitoring have been developed. In these, sound from coughing is recorded digitally and numbers of individual coughs and time spent coughing are calculated by investigators. The system has been validated by correlation with video recordings and has been shown to be responsive to symptom changes following use in cystic fibrosis patients [43] . Objective monitoring of cough in stable COPD has been performed [44] ; here it was shown that cough was more frequent during the day and did not correlate with lung function tests. Many different systems to measure cough have been developed for both research and commercial purposes. In addition to the system detailed above at least two other groups in the UK have developed cough monitoring systems [45, 46] . Only moderate correlation with subjective scoring was observed. The opportunity to combine objective monitoring with experimental rhinovirus infection would provide a unique opportunity to study cough in controlled and well-defined populations; both those with and without airways disease. Both COPD and asthma exacerbations could be studied which would provide data of the duration and severity of cough following viral infection. Not only would this facilitate investigation of the mechanisms of cough but also provide the opportunity to test potential therapies.",

Prophylactic use reduced the viral load but did not reduce the frequency of colds [52] . A review of RV chemotherapy concluded that effective drugs were available but studying these in trials and their use clinically are difficult as almost immediate diagnosis and treatment of virus infection is required [53] . Ribavirin is an effective antiviral for RSV, but larger clinical studies have lacked the power to demonstrate a benefit in bronchiolitis, although there is conflicting evidence in the literature [54] [55] [56] and it has not been specifically shown to reduce cough symptoms. Centrally acting cough suppressors are not specific to virus induced cough and are generally avoided because of their side effect profile. A double blind placebo controlled study using both objective and subjective cough monitoring found very little support for conventional antitussives over placebo in an URTI associated cough [57] . Alternative therapies may be developed in the future, but these will need to have minimal side effects and a rapid onset of action if there are to be of use in URTI and control of cough.",
