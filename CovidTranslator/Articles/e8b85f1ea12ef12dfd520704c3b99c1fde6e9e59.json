Compared to propensity matched patients who were electively listed, there was no significant difference in death at one month after LTx, ECMO use, or ICU stay. The survival at one month and 5 year survival of urgently listed patients were comparable to that of published literature [1] . Older patients, liver impairment, and outside hospital transfers were associated with death after urgent listing. What is not known was their decision process-who to urgently list, and who to bridge? Further investigation into frailty, sarcopenia and other organ-system dysfunction may improve patient selection [1] .",

An analysis of the Chinese national database showed that 52.9% of patients were in NYHA Class IV, ECMO bridging to transplant was used in 4.9% of patients, and 5.5% had mechanical ventilation. Decreased survival was associated with older age, NYHA Class IV, ECMO usage and renal insufficiency.

[6] The Cleveland group should be commended for their results transplanting urgently listed patients. Individual centers need to recognize that LTx for these patients is resource intensive and challenging, and the results of expert high volume centers may not be replicable.",
