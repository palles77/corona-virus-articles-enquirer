Thus, in patients infected with adeno virus type 7 (Group 1), a significant change in titer to this agent occurred, as well as smaller changes to such related types as 3, 11, and 21 (Table 8 ). However, rises in heterologous titers were more consistently seen in patients with Group 2 infections. For example, adenovirus type 8 infections produced rises to 12 related viral types in the Group 2 series. This was reflected in the higher heterologous average titers (Table  8 ). In particular, we noted a tendency for heterologous responders within family groups. In one of these families, all of the blood relatives showed changes in titer to several other Group 2 subtypes after adeno virus type 8 infection.

Variability in his tory, follow-up, and other factors occurred among the patients with adenovirus so the number of patients who met the criteria for various analyses often differed from one test to another. In terms of treatment, however, almost all of the patients with adenovirus required only therapy with topical vasocon strictors or antibiotics, or both.

This observa tion agrees with previous studies that de scribed a similar variety of viral agents re sponsible for epidemic keratoconjunctivitis keratitis. 16 \" 18 The behavior of the individual viral infec tions also conformed to expected patterns. Thus, Group 1 adenoviruses caused more upper respiratory and generalized illness, but less keratitis, than Group 2 infections. 1 ' 2 - [19] [20] [21] Herpes viruses caused more severe keratitis and kerato-uveitis, but clinical illnesses cor related poorly with serologic changes in anti body titer. 28 ' 23 We also encountered difficulty in culturing any virus after seven to ten days of symptoms. This has been reported before for epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, but it is probably true for many other viral syndromes. 2,24- 28 We, like others, also found the hemagglutination-inhibition test to be supe rior to complement-fixation as a serum diag nostic procedure in adenovirus infection. 16 No procedure gave consistent results with tears.",

In studies of immune-complex disease, for instance, rheu matoid arthritis and Aleutian mink disease, antigen-antibody complexes in blood vessel walls can attract complement and inflamma tory cells that cause the damage. 87 ' 88 These complexes are made to persist by maintain ing a low titer antibody, and the disease may be completely eliminated by raising the titer. 88 The cornea is similar to the collagenous tis sue in the walls of blood vessels, 29 and these tissues can absorb certain antigens. 80 ' 81 Therefore, it seems feasible that viral par ticles might be bound to the stromal collagen, form complexes with low levels of antibody diffusing within the cornea, and thereby act as a nidus for inflammation. The subsequent fixation of complement and attraction of in flammatory cells completes the subepithelial infiltrate seen by slit-lamp microscopy. Corticosteroids would disrupt the inflammatory response, but it would not remove the com plexes. Hence, discontinuation of the drug would allow inflammatory cells to reappear. 88 A similar set of circumstances was proposed in the pathogenesis of stromal disease in herpes simplex keratitis. 88 Based on these suppositions, one may con clude that the sometimes permanent visual damage observed in epidemic keratoconjunctivitis might be decreased or eliminated by enhancing the immune response of the in fected patient, perhaps during the acute in fection.",
