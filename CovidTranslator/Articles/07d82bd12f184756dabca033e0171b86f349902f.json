In order to evaluate the specific interactions between the enzyme and the \u03b1hydroxyphosphonate inhibitors, inhibitor 17 was incubated with NV 3CLpro in Tris buffer, pH 8.0. Surprisingly, the enzyme-inhibitor complex formed corresponded to the complex formed between aldehyde 16 and 3CL protease. The formation of this complex indicates initial non-enzymatic (buffer)-or enzyme-catalyzed conversion of \u03b1-hydroxyphosphonate 17 to the corresponding aldehyde 16, followed by the formation of a tetrahedral adduct with the active site cysteine (Cys139). Studies aimed at ascertaining the validity of this hypothesis are in progress. The ensemble of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions Kankanamalage et al. ",

            "text": "Human noroviruses are the primary cause of sporadic and epidemic acute gastroenteritis in the US and worldwide, 1-3 consequently, they constitute an important public health problem, as well as a potential bioterrorism threat. Although the illness is generally considered to be mild and self-limiting, it can incapacitate infected individuals, including military troops on ships or war zones during the symptomatic phase. 4 Noroviruses are very stable in the environment and refractory to many common disinfectants, with only a few virions required to initiate virus infection and shedding, which could be a source for further contamination. Therefore, norovirus outbreaks are hard to contain using routine sanitation, and even implementation of aggressive sanitary measures often fails to prevent subsequent outbreaks. [5] [6] The problem is further compounded by the current dearth of diagnostics, effective vaccines, and norovirus-specific antiviral therapeutics and/or prophylactics. [7] [8] [9] Human noroviruses are single-stranded, positive sense RNA viruses belonging to the Caliciviridae family. 10 Genogroups I, II and IV of the six genogroups (GI-GVI) in the genus Norovirus are known to infect humans. The norovirus genome (7-8 kb) consists of three open reading frames that encode a 200 kDa polyprotein (ORF1), a major capsid protein VP1 (ORF2), and a small basic protein VP2 (ORF3). [10] [11] The mature polyprotein precursor is processed by a virus-encoded 3C-like protease (3CLpro) to generate six mature nonstructural proteins, including the viral protease (3CLpro or NS6 Pro ) and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (NS7 Pol ). 12 Co-and post-translational processing of the polyprotein by norovirus 3CLpro is essential for virus replication, consequently, norovirus 3CLpro has emerged as a potential druggable target for the discovery of anti-norovirus small molecule therapeutics and prophylactics. [13] [14] Norovirus 3CLpro is a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease with a Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad and an extended binding site. 11, 15 The primary substrate specificity of the protease is for a P1 glutamine residue and a strong preference for a -D/E-F-X-L-Q-G-P-sequence (X is H, Q or V), corresponding to the subsites S 5 -S 4 -S 3 -S 2 -S 1 -S 1 '-S 2 '-, respectively. [15] [16] Cleavage is at the P 1 -P 1 ' (Q-G) scissile bond. We have recently reported an array of norovirus inhibitors, including acyclic and cyclic sulfamide [17] [18] [19] and piperazine 20 derivatives. We have also disclosed for the first time peptidyl transition state (TS) inhibitors, 13a-e TS mimics, 13f as well as macrocyclic inhibitors 13g effective in enzyme and cell based assays. We have furthermore described the first high throughput FRET assay of 3CLpro from GI and GII noroviruses as a screening tool for identifying potential protease inhibitors and have determined high resolution X-ray crystal structures of Norwalk virus (NV, a prototype strain of norovirus) 3CLpro in complex with peptidyl transition state inhibitors, 13c as well as the first solution structure of the protease using high-field NMR. 13h Finally, we have demonstrated proof-of-concept using the mouse model of murine norovirus (MNV) infection (vide infra).",

In the case of inhibitors incorporating an aldehyde or \u03b1-ketoamide functionality in their structure, interaction with the active site cysteine (Cys139) leads to the formation of a reversible adduct ( Figure 2 ). 17a-c Furthermore, in previous studies we demonstrated that norovirus 3CLpro shows a strong preference for a P2 cyclohexylalanine and, consequently, a P 2 cyclohexyl alanine residue, as well as a glutamine surrogate, 21 were incorporated in the structures of the inhibitors. The key binding interactions between norovirus 3CLpro and inhibitor were revealed by determining the high resolution X-ray crystal structure of NV 3CLpro with bound inhibitor (I) (R 1 =cyclohexylmethyl, R 2 =H, X=CH(OH)SO 3 Na). The co-crystal structure of the complex showed that, under the crystallization conditions used, the bisulfite reverted to the precursor aldehyde which subsequently formed a tetrahedral adduct with the active site cysteine (Cys139) (Figure 3 ). Inspection of the co-crystal structure revealed opportunities for additional binding interactions with a more efficient use of chemical structure. Specifically, one such opportunity was recognized by observing that there is a particular stretch of residues spanning Ala159, Ala160, Thr161 and Lys162 that are within 4.0 \u00c5 from the benzyl ring ( Figure 4 ). Thus, it was envisaged that the incorporation of an appropriate functional group into the phenyl ring could serve as a locus for the formation of a hydrogen bond with the Thr161 or Lys162 backbone and/or side chains, stabilizing the flexible benzyl segment and increasing binding affinity. The formation of a halogen bond also appeared plausible. 22 Thus, a small focused library of compounds was synthesized to evaluate these hypotheses, the ultimate goal being the identification of a dipeptidyl lead candidate suitable for conducting preclinical studies.",

Refluxing cyclohexylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (or leucine methyl ester hydrochloride) with trichloromethyl chloroformate yielded the corresponding isocyanate which was reacted with an appropriately substituted benzyl alcohol to yield a carbamate adduct methyl ester that was hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid with lithium hydroxide in aqueous THF. Subsequent coupling with glutamine surrogate methyl ester hydrochloride 21 afforded the desired dipeptidyl ester which was then reduced to the corresponding alcohol with lithium borohydride. Dess-Martin oxidation followed by flash chromatography purification yielded pure dipeptidyl aldehyde. The enantiomeric purity of the aldehyde was consistently high, with the amount of epimerized aldehyde ranging between 0-10%, depending on the structure of the dipeptidyl aldehyde. Further reaction of the aldehyde with diethyl phosphite in the presence of diisopropyl ethyl amine yielded the corresponding \u03b1-hydroxyphosphonate as a mixture of epimers. 23 The corresponding bisulfite adducts were readily obtained as white solids by stirring the aldehydes with sodium bisulfite in an ethyl acetate/water mixture. 24 Reaction of the aldehyde with cyclopropyl isonitrile followed by Dess-Martin oxidation of the \u03b1-hydroxy cyclopropyl amide yielded the desired \u03b1-ketoamides. The synthesized compounds are listed in Table 1. described. 13 The IC 50 and ED 50 values are the average of at least two determinations and are listed in Table 1. The enzyme selectivity of a select number of inhibitors was evaluated  against a panel of representative proteases and the results are summarized in Table 2 . The methodologies employed in conducting the enzyme assays and inhibition studies were as described previously by us 13 and others. 25 The in vivo efficacy of compound 16 was evaluated in the murine model of norovirus infection. X-ray crystallography was used to elucidate the nature of the interaction of compound 17 with NV 3CLpro. The X-ray crystal structure of NV 3CLpro revealed the presence of prominent difference electron density with the substructure of 17 that is equivalent to precursor aldehyde inhibitor 16 covalently bound to Cys 139. However, no electron density was observed for the hydroxyphosphonate group that should be present for inhibitor 17 ( Figure 5 ). Instead, the structure of the NV 3CLpro-ligand complex was found to correspond to the covalent adduct of precursor aldehyde inhibitor 16 and NV 3CLpro. In addition, the m-chlorobenzyl ring was partially disordered so the electron density for this region of the inhibitor was somewhat ambiguous. The interactions between NV 3CLpro and inhibitor 16 are shown in Figure 6 . The m-chlorophenyl ring of inhibitor 16 occupies a hydrophobic pocket near Ile 109 and Val 168. Van der Waals and electrostatic surface representations of the inhibitor and NV 3CLpro are shown in Figure 7 .",

Furthermore, the aldehyde and aldehyde bisulfite adduct-derived inhibitors had comparable ED 50 values. These results are consistent with previous studies which showed that the activity of the aldehyde bisulfite adducts parallels the activity of the precursor aldehydes. 13d,f Other things being equal, inhibitors having a cyclohexyl alanine P2 residue are more potent than the corresponding t-butyl glycine or leucine inhibitors (compare compounds 16, 21 and 22). As revealed by the X-ray crystal structure (Figure 7) , the cyclohexyl alanine side chain optimally fills the hydrophobic S2 subsite, while the leucine and t-butyl alanine side chains do not. A range of ring substituents were explored to enhance pharmacological activity. Compounds with a halogen at the meta position were particularly effective (compounds 16, 27, 29, 33).
