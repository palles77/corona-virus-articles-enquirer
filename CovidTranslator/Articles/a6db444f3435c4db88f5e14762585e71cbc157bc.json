A subset (n=63) of unrelated African American subjects from the SAPPHIRE study also provided serum to determine levels of BAFF by an ELISA kit which specifically recognized BAFF (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN). To assess whether rhinovirus induces BAFF expression in airways in vivo, we utilized samples from a separate study of the common cold in which asthmatic adults were evaluated within 3 days of onset of a rhinovirus upper respiratory tract infection (proven by Virochip 6 in nasal lavage), and again when asymptomatic at baseline (i.e., at least 42 days following cold symptom onset). 6 BAFF mRNA was quantified in nasal mucosal samples through a 2-step quantitative real-time RT-PCR.",

This borderline protective finding in the CHIRAH cohort was in contrast to the associations observed in the two other cohorts (Table 1) . Specifically, the minor (A) allele of this SNP was associated with an increase in exacerbation rates in SAGE (RR 1.36, p=0.015). In SAPPHIRE, the A allele was also associated with an increase in ED visits (RR 2.32, p=0.001), oral steroid courses (RR 1.68, p=0.034), and overall exacerbation rates (RR 1.96, p=0.001).

BAFF was also up-regulated in response to community acquired rhinovirus infection, the most common viral infection associated with exacerbations in children and adults. 7, 8 BAFF has been shown to be induced by viruses, 9 and be present in elevated levels in the airway epithelium of children with RSV. 10 The ability of the local tissue to mount a rapid and effective local immunoglobulin response against viruses is likely to be important in limiting of the extent and severity of virusinduced tissue damage. Our group has previously shown that dsRNA (a TLR3 ligand and activator produced by RSV and rhinovirus) potently and effectively induces BAFF production in airway epithelial cells, and that expression of BAFF is regulated by TLR3and IFN-\u03b2-dependent signaling. 11 We hypothesize that higher serum levels of BAFF are associated with a more aggressive immune response to virus, and this may be particularly important since the interaction of innate and adaptive immune responses may provoke asthma exacerbations. 12 This study has limitations. Namely, there were only 5 subjects in CHIRAH with the minor allele and the allelic relationship in this cohort was in the opposite direction to the other two cohorts. Therefore the findings in CHIRAH may have been spurious. Nevertheless, the A allele of rs17564816 was consistently and robustly associated with asthma exacerbations in both SAPPHIRE and SAGE. Given the low frequency of this allele, we did not evaluate the influence of genotype on BAFF induction by rhinovirus, and further studies will be needed.",

Figure 1A displays the RT-PCR results for BAFF gene copy number in naturally acquired infections. The y-axis represents the BAFF gene copy number. The x-axis represents the timing of the sample in days after cold onset. Figure 1B displays the concentration of BAFF protein in nasal lavage fluids in naturally acquired infections. The y-axis represents the BAFF concentration in pg/ml. The x-axis represents the timing of the sample in days after cold onset. * Analyses in SAGE were adjusted for patient age, sex, African ancestry, estimated socioeconomic status based on geocoded home address, current smoking status, passive smoke exposure, total serum IgE level, and use of an inhaled corticosteroid. Analyses in SAPPHIRE adjusted for age, sex, African ancestry, educational level, household income, percent of predicted forced expiratory volume at one second, asthma duration, current smoking status, passive smoking exposure, allergic sensitization (defined as =1 allergen-specific IgE value), and baseline corticosteroid use. \u2020 Composite outcome for an asthma exacerbation includes oral corticosteroid use, an asthma-related emergency room visit, or an asthma-related hospitalization. \u2021 The additive genetic model for rs17564816 was coded as GG=0, AG=1, and AA=2, where A is the minor allele.
