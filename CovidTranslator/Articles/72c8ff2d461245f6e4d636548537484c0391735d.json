Encouragement from family and friends, travel and previous positive vaccination experiences were motivators for getting vaccinated. Healthcare workers played a role in influencing many of the participants' decision-making. Common misconceptions included vaccines considered as necessary only before travel and as a cure rather than prevention. Most participants exhibited ambivalence, giving reasons both for and against vaccine uptake. Discussion: Most older adults do not perceive influenza as a potentially serious disease nor trust in influenza vaccines' efficacy. Misconceptions played a significant role in vaccine decline. Novel findings include the importance of the family unit in decision making, prioritization of chronic health problems over vaccination and misconception that vaccines are only needed when travelling out of country. Healthcare workers and family members appear to be important influencers in the decision making of older adults and should be actively engaged in future health promotion initiatives.",

Influenza needs to be portrayed as a potentially serious illness for the older adults. This could be achieved with examples of individuals who have suffered complications from influenza, since a lack of encounter with serious episodes of influenza within one's social circle had been cited as a reason for trivialising flu. Furthermore, care should be taken to emphasize that side effects following vaccination are often mild, hence unlikely to affect activities of daily living. The introduction of an annual reminder system could prompt those who have received influenza vaccine to return for their yearly vaccination. This may be useful for older adults whose family members or caregivers lack time and attention to keep track of their vaccination schedule.",

Not only are interventions needed for patients, but additional training of healthcare workers may be valuable as a recent study in Singapore identified how local healthcare workers did not trust the evidence for influenza vaccination and doubted its relevance to the local context [28] . A widely-disseminated, locally-compiled synthesis addressing specific concerns of hesitant healthcare workers was recommended.",

The contributing factors were many, extending beyond the individual to family, friends and healthcare workers. One of the novel findings was the misconception of vaccination being only a travel precaution. Most respondents shared some ambivalence giving reasons both for and against uptake. Whilst being receptive to recommendations from health care professionals, the absence of advice was interpreted as implying vaccination was unnecessary. Professionals and patients could benefit from annual prompts if uptake is to be increased and sustained amongst vulnerable older adults.",
