These trees may be based on epidemiological data that relate to the timing of infection and infectiousness, or genetic data that show the genetic relatedness of pathogens isolated from infected individuals. Genetic data are becoming increasingly important in the estimation of transmission trees of viral pathogens due to their inherently high mutation rate. Here, we propose a maximum-likelihood approach that allows epidemiological and genetic data to be combined within the same analysis to infer probable transmission trees. We apply this approach to data from 20 farms infected during the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, using complete viral genome sequences from each infected farm and information on when farms were first estimated to have developed clinical disease and when livestock on these farms were culled. Incorporating known infection links due to animal movement prior to imposition of the national movement ban results in the reduction of the number of trees from 41 472 that are consistent with the genetic data to 1728, of which just 4 represent more than 95% of the total likelihood calculated using a model that accounts for the epidemiological data. These trees differ in several ways from those constructed prior to the availability of genetic data.",

Although there may be numerous combinations of transmission pathways that are consistent with the genetic or epidemiological data alone, an analysis combining both types of data can lead to the identification of a much smaller set of plausible transmission pathways. Analytical methods to integrate these two types of datasets are beginning to be developed ( Wallace et al. 2007 ), but the increasing speed and economy with which viral genetic data can be generated during epidemics require the development of a wider range of approaches, if full advantage of these data sources is to be taken in improving the tracing of transmission pathways.",

Viruses were sequenced from farms infected at the beginning of the 2001 UK FMDV outbreak, and the genetic data were shown to be consistent with the transmission pathways established from contact-tracing studies. However, for the remainder of the outbreak, and following the national ban on animal movement (NMB), the spread of virus is much less well understood with infection assumed to be transmitted by either airborne spread or mechanical transfer on people or inanimate objects (fomites). Indeed, the precise source and route of infection for the vast majority of the 2030 premises infected during the 2001 UK epidemic remain unknown.",

Although the contact-tracing data are difficult to use to pinpoint the precise origin of infection with high confidence, the information concerning the timing of infection is clear. For every farm involved, the time at which clinical disease began on a farm (estimated from lesion ageing) and the date on which animals were culled were recorded. This information can be used to estimate the most likely date on which a farm was infected and thereby the most likely period over which a farm would have been infectious. These temporal data have been used previously to estimate the sequences of transmission events (Haydon et al. 2003) , henceforth referred to as transmission trees. While many of the overall characteristics of these transmission trees (e.g. estimates of the average number of susceptible farms infected by an infectious farm) are robust to variations in their precise structure, the very large numbers of different transmission trees that are consistent with these temporal data render them mostly unhelpful with respect to identifying particular transmission events with confidence.",

We have then combined the inferences from these two types of data to determine statistically a set of most likely transmission trees, which we show to be a much smaller set than obtained through analysis of either data type alone.

We took into account the known transmission history between farms 1 and 5 and restricted the tree configurations to those that included these four transmission events as a fixed link. Prior to the movement ban, infected animals could be transferred between farms and we allowed for the possibility of virus transmission without mutation. After the movement ban, farm-to-farm transmission probably required more infection cycles and, given the rate of molecular evolution of FMDV, the possibility of farm-to-farm transfer without mutation was considered to be negligible. The overall strategy was to construct a list of farms on which each putative virus haplotype could have been located, assuming no back mutation and only a single lineage present on each farm, and then to enumerate all transmission trees consistent with all combinations of possible locations of haplotypes. Specifically, the algorithm worked backwards from the tips of the tree derived using TCS, identifying the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of viral haplotypes found on pairs of farms, assigning these MRCAs to having been located on one Figure 1 .

Applying this algorithm recursively until each haplotype has a unique farm assigned to it leads directly to one possible transmission tree (an example of this procedure is described in figure 2 ). The likelihood of each tree was then estimated based on the available epidemiological data as described below.",

Using only the known transmission events relating farms 1-5, 1728 possible transmission trees remain consistent with the rooted parsimony tree identified using the genetic data. This is because while it is possible to identify viruses that share a common ancestor, it is often not possible to identify the farm on which the ancestors were present, and therefore the exact direction of transmission events. However, the difficulties in interpreting the genetic data can be overcome in part by the addition of epidemiological data: here, the most likely time of infection and infectiousness of a farm, which enables the likelihood of particular transmission events to be estimated. This integration of information from the two datasets enables the identification of the most likely trees at a resolution far greater than that possible using either dataset alone.",

This forces us to question the accuracy of the data relating to the timing of infection. Lesion dating is imperfect with an unknown amount of error associated with it. However, the dominant source of error associated with using lesions to estimate the date of infection is that the oldest lesions may be overlooked entirely (and it is for these reasons that the function describing the likelihood that a farm was infected on a particular day, I i (t), was only minimally constrained). This is particularly likely on farms with livestock that include sheep where the clinical symptoms of disease are often mild. The farms M, F and G all maintained substantial sheep herds in which disease was eventually confirmed (table 1) and it is possible that infection was present on these farms considerably earlier than estimated, but went unreported.",

When this number is unusually large it suggests that virus has been replicating in some other livestock population, either on unidentified intermediate farms, or on the recipient farm but in a population in which disease had previously been overlooked. For example, the large number of changes observed on farm A (more than double the average expected for a single farm-farm transmission event) is suggestive of such an intermediate. It is important to recognize that the number of changes detectable between consecutively infected farms will probably depend on the mode of infection. In this study, the number of nucleotide substitutions per infection generation interval is lower prior to the imposition of the national movement ban, compared with after, probably because there are less viral replication cycles associated with the infections arising as a result of movement of infected animals, compared with fomite-associated transmission. Data of this sort could be used in future investigations to infer the presence of undetected sources of infection or to determine the most likely number of infected premises in a transmission chain.

This tree differs from the original contacttracing tree proposed by Defra (which is inconsistent with the genetic data). First, the separate lineage of infected premises represented by A and N is anomalous, and when compared with the remainder of the sequences available from the 2001 UK outbreak (Cottam et al. 2006) represents transmission of the virus directly into the area from the source of the outbreak, and not via Longtown and Hexham markets (as is thought to be the case for all other infected premises throughout the UK; Gibbens et al. 2001) . This finding suggests that further study of the outbreak is necessary to determine the origins of this previously unidentified chain of transmission events. Second, when the layout of the farms is considered ( figure 1 ), it appears that transmission events are significantly clustered with the distance between farms playing an important epidemiological role. This supports the previous interpretations that virus was spreading to nearby farms with a greater likelihood than distant farms. The significant directionality in transmissions is interesting, but could arise for a number of different reasons. It may be a consequence of the road network that connects the farms or may result from infection having been introduced on the westward edge of a cluster of farms (although the existence of susceptible farms to the east, north and south suggests this was not the case).",

M. Cottam et al. 893 in this space quantitatively evaluated by the use of epidemiological data. This likelihood, estimated from the epidemiological data, could be made more sophisticated by accounting for the mode of transmission (e.g. incorporating information about the possible movement of animals between farms) or the livestock composition on particular farms (for example, pigs are generally regarded as more infectious than cattle or sheep, whereas cattle are more susceptible than sheep or pigs; Alexandersen et al. 2002 Alexandersen et al. , 2003a . The farm infectiousness is not explicitly quantified in this analysis. While infectiousness is unlikely to remain constant over the course of an infection, available data do not enable a parametrization of possible change (Savill et al. 2007 ). Here, we have simply assumed that the probability of a farm being a source of infection varies over time in a way dictated by the timing of infection. It is plausible that susceptibility varies between farms, and if this were quantified it could also be incorporated into future models.",

Between all 15 sequences (A-P) there were 85 variant nucleotides, of which 24 resulted in non-synonymous changes. Of the 85 variant nucleotides, five occurred within the VP1 capsid gene. The epithelium sample from farm D (which was sequenced twice independently) yielded identical sequences. A statistical parsimony tree depicting the genetic relationship between the viruses sequenced was generated for the 23 sequences, rooted using the genome sequence of the closest previously sequenced virus (from South Africa) as shown in figure 2.(b) Temporal infection profiles of infected premises and transmission tracing For each farm the distributions of likely date of infection and the most likely period of infectiousness were calculated and are shown in figure 3. The overlaps of infection and infectious periods can be clearly noted, providing a low-resolution impression of possible Temporal infection profiles of 20 farms infected with FMDV in 2001.
