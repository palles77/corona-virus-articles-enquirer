            "text": "ECHO's recommendations call for various stakeholders to take action, such as WHO to institutionalise a crosscutting and life-course approach to ending childhood obesity and for civil society, philanthropic and academic institutions, and the private sector to mobilise their comparative advantage to end childhood obesity (panel 2). These actions notwithstanding, ECHO remains fi rmly of the opinion that it is the primary responsibility of governments to ensure that policies and actions address the obesogenic environment and to provide guidance and support for optimum development at each stage of the life-course. By improving and integrating these actions, there will be major benefi ts to other parts of the maternal, reproductive, child health, and non-communicable disease prevention and control and health systems agendas. First, along with the rising oil revenues in recent decades, Saudi Arabia has seen a rapid epidemiological transition in the population (table). 4 The uptake of some health-promoting behaviours has been limited by Saudia Arabia's unemployment rate (11\u00b77% in 2014), moderate levels of education, and climatic and sociocultural conditions. 3, 5, 6 The high burden of undiagnosed and uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension, 6,7 will consume a large proportion of the health budget. 8 Second, future temperature in the region is projected to increase consistently and exceed the threshold deemed unsuitable for human adaptability. 9 This changing climate will have an eff ect on the promotion of some healthy lifestyle habits, the country's production of fresh fruits and vegetables, and micronutrient defi ciencies. 9 For example, vitamin D defi ciency from inadequate exposure to sun and limited intake of enriched products is common in Saudi Arabia. 10 Finally, there is a need for sustained investment in the control of emerging infectious diseases in the region. Such control eff orts are important given the risk of emerging diseases within Saudi Arabia, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, and as a result of disease importation through the large expatriate workforce and the 2-3 million pilgrims for Hajj and 5-6 million pilgrims for Umrah who come to Saudi Arabia each year from more than 180 countries. 3, 11 Although economic recession is often feared as a \"health tragedy\", evidence from high-income countries is mixed and related to variations in social and political contexts. 12, 13 In high-income countries, some health indices showed counter-cyclical eff ects with economic contractions (eg, increases in suicides, depression, and anxiety disorders and worsening reproductive health outcomes). 12, 13 However, mortality is shown to be pro-cyclical and it decreases during rapid economic contractions. In high-income countries, there are generally slower declines in mortality during periods of economic growth and greater declines in mortality during recessions. 13 In low-income countries, economic growth seems to improve health through improvements in basic services, until a country reaches $5000-10 000 GDP per person. 12 Declines in mortality in high-income countries during recession could be related to decline in excess mortality from modifi able causes of death, such as those arising from alcohol abuse and motor vehicle accidents. 12, 13 Given that Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of traffi c-related deaths globally, 4 the country might benefi t from the austerity measures in this regard. If Saudi Arabia maintains increased relief spending on child health, improvements in access to nutrition and health, and strong infectious diseases control then these approaches can also help reduce mortality.",

For example, Saudi Arabia's premarital sickle cell screening is a unique initiative. 14 Despite free health care, Saudi Arabia's shortcomings are in the control of non-communicable diseases and mitigation of risk factors for disease. 4 Only 23% of Saudi adults have had a preventive care visit. 15, 16 There is a need to consider multipronged approaches to health promotion and avoidance of risk factors, including those that fall outside the services of health ministry (eg, enforcement of motor vehicle accident prevention advisories, point of sale restrictions on tobacco). By training primary care providers to serve as advocates for health promotion, each encounter between the provider and patient can be used as an opportunity to educate patients about a set of prevention messages. Informed personal decision making is important to increase the uptake of healthy lifestyles and prevention recommendations; this is a process achieved through education and a sense of personal empowerment that comes with employment.

Saudi Arabia has been resilient during oil price fl uctuations in the past, so the new government budget came as a surprise. The new spending plan refl ects several measures to curb subsidies, raise revenue, and improve healthy lifestyles. 2 Health and social aff airs consume about a fi fth ($45 billion, 5% of GDP) of Saudi Arabian Government spending. 2,3 There are not many relevant examples of the health eff ects of recession and structural adjustments for countries with a similar development trajectory of Saudi Arabia. Economic growth in Saudi Arabia (19th highest GDP worldwide) contrasts with its position on the Human Development Index (39th in the world); 3 this gap indicates substantial development challenges. Further, the economic changes are occurring amid other challenges unique to the region.",
