[1] [2] [3] Delays in the detection of a causative pathogen or in the response-combined with increased global urbanization and connectivity-may result in social instability. 4 Efforts to identify the origins and causative agents are necessary for diagnosis, treatment, limiting the spread, for control, or prevention of an EID caused by an unknown microorganism. When the microbial etiology of an outbreak caused by a new or unknown microorganism is considered definite, Koch's postulates must be satisfied. 5 Koch's postulates consist of the following requirements: 1) the organism must always be present in every case of the disease; 2) the organism must be isolated from a host containing the disease and grown in pure culture; 3) samples of the organism taken from pure culture must cause the same disease when inoculated into a healthy, susceptible animal in the laboratory; 4) the organism must be isolated from the inoculated animal and must be identified to be the same original organism first isolated from the original diseased host. 5 These principles have established the significance of laboratory culture of infectious agents. Koch's postulates are at the heart of traditional microbial etiology.",

Forty-eight human cases of infection in northeast China were reported in 2014.22 8. Rickettsia raoultii was first detected in ticks in the former Soviet Union in 1999. A human infection was reported in France in 2009. Human infections were confirmed in China in 2012. 23 9. Borrelia miyamotoi was first identified in ticks and rodents in Japan in 1994. A human infection was confirmed in Russia in 2011. Human infections were reported in China in 2018. 24 10. A novel spotted fever group of Rickettsia, designated as Rickettsia sp. XY99, was identified in central China. Human infection was diagnosed in 2015. 25 11. A novel hepatovirus tentatively named Marmota himalayana hepatovirus (MHHAV) was isolated from the wild animal Marmota himalayana in China. Phylogenetic analysis of MHHAV and primate hepatoviruses has led to the most recent common ancestor 1000 years ago. Nevertheless, no human infection has been identified so far. 26 12. A new subtype of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) has been discovered in the wild rodent Marmota himalayana on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China and proposed to be a Himalayan subtype (Him-TBEV). Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Him-TBEV diverged from other subtypes of the eastern TBEV group 2469 years ago. Public health significance should be evaluated carefully.",
