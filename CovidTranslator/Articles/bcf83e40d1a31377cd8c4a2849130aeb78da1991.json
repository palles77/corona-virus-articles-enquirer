            "text": "Thiazolides are polypharmacology agents with at least three mechanisms of action against a broad spectrum of parasites, bacteria and viruses. In respiratory viruses they inhibit the replication of orthomyxoviridae and paramyxoviridae at a post-translational level. Nitazoxanide 1a, the prototype thiazolide, was originally developed as an antiparasitic agent and later repurposed for the treatment of viral respiratory infections. The second generation thiazolides following nitazoxanide, such as the 5-chloro analogue RM-5038 2a, are also broad-spectrum antiviral agents as we have reported. Both 1a and its effective circulating metabolite, tizoxanide 1b, are 5-nitrothiazole derivatives, while RM-5038 2a and its de-acetyl derivative RM-4848 2b are the corresponding 5-chloro derivatives. Recently 1a has completed phase II-III clinical trials in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in a total of 2865 adults and adolescents of at least 12 months of age with viral acute respiratory illness. Since its biodisposition is primarily seen in the gastro-intestinal tract, its efficacy in systemic viral diseases requires relatively high oral doses. The chemical synthesis of new derivatives with a better systemic absorption was therefore urgently needed. In order to improve their systemic absorption, new amino-ester prodrug derivatives of 1b and RM4848 2b were prepared and tested for their animal pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology. RM-5061 8a in rats showed 7-fold higher blood concentration compared to 1a: absolute bioavailability increased from 3 to 20%, with a good safety profile in animal safety pharmacology and toxicology.",

            "text": "Nitazoxanide 1a, the first of thiazolides discovered in 1975 by Rossignol and Cavier is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent effective against protozoa, nematodes, cestodes and trematodes [1] . It was registered throughout Latin America, Egypt, India and Bangladesh for the treatment of intestinal protozoa and helminths while in the United States the drug was approved for the treatment of two intestinal protozoa, Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis [2e4] . The antiprotozoal activity of 1a against anaerobic organisms such as some protozoa and bacteria is due to its interference with the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme-dependent electron transfer reaction, which is essential to anaerobic metabolism. Against helminths and Mycobacterium tuberculosis it disrupts membrane potential and homeostasis of intramicro-organisms [5e8] . Thiazolides also inhibit protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and possess a broad spectrum of activity against parasites and viruses. In Neospora caninum, an apicomplexan emerging protozoa related to Cryptosporidium parvum, 1a binds to the NcPDI blocking the protozoan replication [9] . In respiratory viruses 1a inhibits the replication of respiratory viruses belonging to the classes of orthomyxoviridae and paramyxoviridae at a post-translational level. [10, 11] . 1a and a number of structurally related thiazolides, e. g. RM5038 2a are also active against both hepatitis B and C viruses at low micromolar concentrations [12e14] . For example, against a range of respiratory viruses including H1N1 influenza A strains, 1a exhibits IC 50 values of 0.3e1.0 mg/mL; against a range of flaviviridae including hepatitis C, from 0.05 to 0.5 mg/mL; against hepatitis B (hepadnaviridae), 0.06 mg/mL.",

This is a perfect bio-disposition profile for a drug intended to treat intestinal pathogens, but much less desirable for a systemic antiviral agent. Upon oral absorption it is immediately metabolized into deacetyl derivative 1b, which is subsequently metabolized in the liver as tizoxanide-glucuronide and rapidly eliminated via urine [19, 20] . Ideally, the treatment of viral systemic infections as opposed to parasites or viruses infecting the intestinal tract calls for a compound with a better oral biodisposition and metabolism than 1a but ideally liberating in the blood stream the same active circulating metabolite, 1b and its inactive glucuronide. A considerable amount of safety and efficacy data have been accumulated for these derivatives in the United States and abroad during the last 20 years.",

We later found that DMF was a superior solvent, especially for 1b, and performed well on scale-up, delivering a 90% yield of 7a. Deprotection was very conveniently achieved by treatment of 7a with HCl-dioxane, as the HCl salt RM5061 8a of the product could be crystallised directly from the reaction medium and was obtained in excellent yield. Importantly, RM5061 8a showed no appreciable hydrolysis after standing at 20 C for three months (<1% of 1b seen by NMR analysis and by HPLC); its aqueous solubility was approximately 5 mg/mL [16] . It was of paramount importance to assay the chiral purity of RM5061 8a; for comparison, valacyclovir is typically obtained from acyclovir in about 92% e.e. [26] . From Boc-Tle-OH (S-enantiomer), using DMF as solvent, RM5061 8a was obtained in 99% purity by HPLC and the e.e. was 99.8%. Starting from the corresponding derivative of D-tertleucine, by chiral HPLC analysis the e. e. of ent-8a was determined to be 99.5%.",

No scrambling of NMR peaks could be seen in either product at the NMR detection level; here, epimerisation would have generated diastereoisomeric mixtures, possibly to different extents for the two products. As might have been intuitively expected, the stabilities of these compounds by NMR, ca.5% hydrolysis after 3 months at 20 C, were greater than 5 but less than RM5061 8a/ RM5064 8b. compounds given orally remain in the gut. In order to assess the absolute bioavailability of our new amino-acid ester derivatives, RM-5061 8a and RM-5064 8b, in comparison with 1a and RM5038 2a we carried out four parallel studies, each one including six Sprague-Dawley rats weighing about 300 g divided into two groups of three animals.

It was recently repurposed as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent in the treatment of viral acute respiratory infections. Phase III clinical trials carried out in 2865 adults and adolescents with uncomplicated influenza A and B showed that the drug reduced the duration of the influenza illness when compared to placebo with a p value < 0.05. Additionally the studies showed that nitazoxanide compared to placebo was effective in the treatment of the common cold caused by rhinovirus and coronavirus. Further studies in patients with viral respiratory infections at risk of developing complications, children, and adults and children with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) are currently underway. It was important to identify new derivatives with better systemic absorption, and we have now shown that RM-5061 8a is a second prodrug for tizoxanide 1b. RM5061 8a is more soluble and better absorbed in laboratory animals than 1a and is now undergoing Phase I clinical trials. It may provide an oral dose effective at a lower dosage, and more importantly an injectable form of tizoxanide that nitazoxanide was unable to do.",
