We previously have demonstrated that proteins expressed in vitro from a cDNA clone of the 3CLpro region possess proteinase activity, and that the proteinase is able to cleave substrate in trans. We sought to determine if the 27-kDa in vitro cleavage product (p27) was an active form of the 3CLpro and whether this was consistent with the 3CLpro expressed in virus-infected cells. Antibodies directed against the 3CLpro domain detected 27-kDa MHV proteins in vitro and in MHV-A59-infected cells. The 27-kDa proteins were able to cleave substrate in trans without other protein cofactors or supplemental membranes, and the p27 proteinase activity was retained after purification by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. When p27 was expressed in vitro with portions of the aminoand carboxy-terminal flanking domains (MP1 and MP2), p27 was not liberated by cis cleavage. The proteolytic activity of the 27-kDa proteins was inhibited by a variety of cysteine and serine proteinase inhibitors, and was eliminated by the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64d. These results indicate that the 27-kDa protein is a mature proteinase in MHV-A59infected cells, and that appropriate processing of this molecule occurs in vitro. \u1b67",

PMSF completely inhibited p27 cleavage activity, compared with the partial inhibition seen in virusinfected cells. E64c completely inhibited cleavage activity of p27, similar to the result obtained in virus-infected cells. E64c is the active form of E64 to which E64d is converted on entry into cells. The lowest concentration of E64c used (100 mg/ml or 300 mM) was 25% of that required to inhibit cleavage of p27 in cells, indicating that the proteinase was more sensitive to inhibition by E64 than previously thought. Zinc chloride inhibited proteolytic activity of p27 isolated from virus-infected cells, but did not inhibit activity of p27 isolated from in vitro translation products of pGpro.

In contrast, when pGproG41 IVT products were incubated with gel fragments containing the 27-kDa region proteins obtained by immunoprecipitation of infected cells by preimmune serum, no cleavage of p27 was observed (lane 2).

However, the proteinase We have identified the active 3C-like proteinase molecules expressed from MHV-A59 ORF 1a in vitro and in activity was not purified from the cell lysates in either of these studies. Our approach allowed us to demonstrate virus-infected cells. The proteins have identical apparent masses of 27 kDa, smaller than either the predicted MHV the proteolytic activity of a specific purified protein, something that has not previously been accomplished with a 3CLpro (33 kDa) or the identified human coronavirus 229E 3CLpro (34 kDa). The MHV 3CLpro has been pre-coronavirus proteinase. The p27 protein precipitated from MHV-infected DBT dicted to span amino acids from S 3334 to Q 3635 , and to have a mass of 34 kDa (Gorbalenya et al., 1989a,b ; Lee cells was relatively abundant. We were able to detect p27 following immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled ly-et al., 1991) , similar to that predicted for the HCV 229E 3CLpro. A 34-kDa protein has been detected in 229E-sates from 1 1 10 5 cells by gel exposures of 12 hr. In contrast, the putative HCV 229E 3CLpro was reported to infected cells, using antibodies specific to the 3CLpro region (Ziebuhr et al., 1995) . The 229E 34-kDa protein be present in very small amounts in infected cells, requiring prolonged exposures of 28 days to detect the protein from infected cells has not been shown to possess proteinase activity; however, a 229E 34-kDa protein ex- (Ziebuhr et al., 1995) . It is not known whether these differences reflect the sensitivity of the antisera used or are pressed in E. coli from a cDNA clone encoding the predicted 3CLpro was able to cleave substrate. true indicators of the amounts of the proteinases produced by the two viruses. MHV p27 was detected in cells We have not determined the reason for the discrepancy between the observed and predicted masses of beginning at 6 hr postinfection, similar to the other MHV gene 1 products identified in virus-infected cells. This the MHV 3CLpro. Gel analysis may underestimate the molecular mass of proteins, especially if the protein is also was distinct from the results obtained with the HCV-229E 3CLpro, which was detected at earlier time points, not completely denatured, or if the protein binds a disproportionately large amount of SDS with a concomitant but declined at later times p.i. (Ziebuhr et al., 1995) . Once processed, p27 was resistant to degradation for increase in negative charge. We believe that the p27 proteins were completely denatured, since translation over 2 hr in infected cells and in reticulocyte lysates, suggesting that stability and accumulation of p27 may products were boiled extensively in SDS-containing loading buffer before electrophoresis. Further, boiling the be important for processing of the gene 1 polyprotein. It was surprising that no p27-containing precursors were samples in loading buffer containing 8 M urea, followed by electrophoresis on urea-containing gels, did not alter detected in MHV-infected cells. The B3 antiserum was raised against a fusion protein that extended into the the apparent molecular mass of the 27-kDa proteins (data not shown). We are currently attempting to resolve domain flanking the amino terminus of p27, yet still did not detect precursors. Although it is possible that the this question by identifying the carboxy-terminal cleavage site of p27 and by assessing the size and proteolytic available antisera were unable to bind to intermediate precursors to p27, or that background proteins obscured activity of truncated versions of the predicted full-length 3CLpro.",
