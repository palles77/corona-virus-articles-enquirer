In comparison with the use of eggs and animals, virus growth in cell culture became more convenient and cost effective. This method is considered gold standard for virus isolation and identification. Classical approaches for the detection and diagnosis of avian viruses were based on their replication in embryonated eggs, their cultivation in cell-cultures, and their ability to haemagglutinate red blood cells. Afterwards, the avian virus specific detection was facilitated by morphological alterations of the developing embryo, by haemagglutination inhibition of virus by specific antibodies, antibody detection in sera by ELISA, immunofluorescence and by other serological assays (Williams, 2016) . These assays were based on the virus ability to replicate in experimental systems. The secondary amplification system might differ from the virus natural milieu, the chicken body, and might lead to artifactual outcomes, as will be discussed in the present review. The development of the revolutionary concept of demonstrating the pathogen nuclei acid by various assays brought a new era in the development of novel diagnostic assay, however with certain advantages and disadvantages. The latest molecular diagnostic technologies are more advantageous as they offer more sensitive, less time consuming and high throughput results. The novel technologies include the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), real-time PCR (qPCR), DNA probe, nucleic acid sequencing etc.. Nowadays, no diagnostic area cannot be imagined without molecular amplification assays. As a result, at the time of writing this review article, a PubMed search of \"diagnosis of avian viruses by PCR\" resulted in 721,000 hits, including all avian viruses and various combinations of assays. As it is impossible to cover the field, so in that review will mainly describe the process of incorporating the molecular amplification for the detection of avian oncogenic viruses.",

Concomitantly with the development of the new methods, the concept of diagnostic sampling evolved based on experiences gained from the diagnosis of commercial poultry by molecular assays. In addition, complexities that might be considered with the transition of poultry virus diagnosis towards advanced assays will be critically reviewed. The concepts conferred in the present review will be illustrated mainly by the studies on three avian vaccine viruses, Marek's disease (MDV) (Schat and Nair, 2013) , (Family: Herpesviridae, Subfamily: Alphaherpesviridae, Genus: Mardivirus, Species: gallid herpesvirus 2, GaHV-2, ICVT, 2017) chicken anemia (CAV) (family Circoviridae, genus Gyrovirus) (Schat and Van Santen, 2013) , Infectious Laryngotracheitis (ILTV) (Garcia et al., 2013) , (Family: Herpesviridae, Subfamily: Alphaherpesviridae, Genus:Iltovirus, Species: Infectious Laryngotracheitis virus) and the turkey flavivirus, Turkey Meningoencephalitis Virus (TMEV) (Iancunescu, 1976 ) (genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae). However, diagnostic complexities of additional avian viruses will be discussed, such the poultry respiratory viruses, Avian Influenza (AIV) , (Infectious Bronchitis Newcastle disease (NDV) (Miller and Koch, 2013) Marek's disease virus (MDV) (Schat and Nair, 2013) include 3 distinctive serotypes, affecting chickens and turkeys. Most MDV serotype 1 viruses are virulent, as they infect and transform T-lymphocytes. MDV-1 induced clinical and sub-clinical infections such as neurological symptoms, tumors and immunosuppression. The virus replicates in the feather follicle epithelium and spreads horizontally in poultry house with dust and dander. Major morbidity and mortality associated with MDV-1 led to intensive effort during the 70\u2032 to develop vaccines. Since then the disease is controlled worldwide by vaccination of day-old chicks or 17-18 embryonic day embryos in ovo with live avirulent and nononcogenic vaccine strains of the three serotypes. The serotype 1 MDV vaccine, denoted CVI988/ Rispens (de Boer et al., 1986; Rispens et al., 1972) , developed from a naturally-attenuated MDV-1 strain, is currently the most effective and widely used vaccine. The serotype 2 MDV vaccine (SB-1) (Schat and Calnek, 1978) , also derived from a chicken naturally avirulent isolate and serotype 3 vaccine, developed from a herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) (Okasaki et al., 1970) are also in use.",

The infection is manifested with evident disease or as a subclinical infection and immunosuppression, reflecting negatively on diseases caused by other pathogens, and affecting vaccination efficacies (Schat and van Santen, 2013) . In young chicks, the infection may display with various signs with various degrees of severity. These signs include stunting, runting, increased mortality, anemia, bone marrow cell depletion, subcutaneous hemorrhages and atrophy of secondary lymphatic organs such as the thymus, bursa and spleen. These effects are caused because of the multi-potent efficacy of CAV to infect stem cells of both the hematopoietic and lymphocytes cell lineages in the bone marrow and thymus. Clinical signs do not appear always, and sometime are barely evident, because of age-associated resistance and/ or immune system maturation. Infection of commercial chicken flocks in Israel with CAV showed that CAV infection correlates with a decline in productivity (Davidson et al., 2004a,b) .",

With that concept, the diagnostic PCR amplification of MDV, and the retroviruses reticuloendotheliosis (REV) (Family: Retroviridae, Subfamily: Orthoretrovirinae, Genus, Gammaretrovirus, Species: Reticulendotheliosis virus) and avian leucosis (ALV) (Family: Retroviridae, Subfamily: Orthoretrovirinae, Genus, Alpharetrovirus, Species: Avian Leukosis virus) was performed on DNA purified from spleen and liver of diseases chickens (Davidson et al., 1995a,b) . However, for the diagnosis of the specific neurological manifestation in chicken infected with virulent MDV in the early stages on infection, the transient paralysis, we envisaged that the affected chicken brain would contain a higher number of virions than the blood and spleen, therefore, the brain was demonstrated as the preferred site for MDV-DNA (Davidson et al., 1998) . A similar approach was engaged for the direct demonstration of the turkey flavivirus in the brain tissue of paralysed turkeys (Davidson et al., 2000) . In the case of ILTV infection, where the ILTV target cells for replication were the epithelium lining inside the trachea, often causing exudates, the trachea content was initially used as the source for DNA purification to amplify the ILTV from clinically-affected commercial chickens (Davidson et al., 2009) . avian Another example would be the complex of avian respiratory viruses, AIV, NDV, avian pneumovirus (APMV) (Family: Paramyxoviridae, Subfamily: Pneumovirinae, Genus: Metapneumovirus, Species: Avian metapneumovirus) and the Turkey Rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV) Miller and Koch, 2013) (Family: Paramyxoviridae, Subfamily: Pneumovirinae, Genus: Metapneumovirus, Species: Turkey Rhinotracheitis virus). To demonstrate the presence of these viruses, direct sampling from trachea and cloaca of suspected birds is performed using dedicated swabs (Williams, 2016) . However, for the collection of virus isolates, their use in experimental infection trials and sequencing, the respiratory viruses are further cultivated in embryonated eggs or in tissue cultures. As RNA viruses are mutating at a high rate upon each replication cycle, drifts, namely 10 \u22124 -10 -6 mutations/ nucleotide/replication cycle, (Duffy et al., 2008) , ex vivo amplification causes de novo genomic changes that were not reflect on the original isolate. Moreover, in the case of AIV, genomic exchanges can occur between fragments, shifts, leading often to the creation of new AIV strains .",

            "text": "We envisaged the possibility of using feathers for direct diagnosis and research because their great advantages; sampling of feathers is non-invasive, it is a relatively easy and convenient procedure, as bleeding and necropsy could be avoided. In MDV research the feathers were emphasized, since this is the only site where fully infectious viruses are produced in the chicken. In fact, MDV was the first avian virus described in the context of its presence in feathers and was extensively studied (Schat and Nair, 2013) . As MDV became the prototype avian virus which reside in the feather follicle epithelium and shafts, the feather tips were incorporated for use in the diagnosis of commercial flocks (Davidson and Borenshtain, 2002 , Davidson and Shkoda, 2005 Davidson, 2009a) . Ralapanawe et al. (2016) studied commercial layers demonstrating the MDV-1 in feathers and dust. However, monitoring the virus presence in feathers illustrate more accurately the current infection status than dust, because dust reflects cumulatively all the birds in the poultry house over a prolonged timeperiod. CAV detection in the feather tips was firstly reported in experimental infection trials (Davidson et al., 2008a,b) , and then applied for diagnosis (Davidson et al., 2013) . The ILTV viremia could also be demonstrated in the feather shafts of commercial ILTV-infected chickens (Davidson et al., 2009c; Davidson et al., 2016) . TMEV was the first turkey virus that could be detected in the turkey feather shafts (Davidson et al., 2017b) The correlation between sampling feathers or pooled visceral organs for the detection of MDV and for CAV in commercial flocks was analysed. We included samples submitted for diagnosis from various poultry flocks and of various lines and ages. The DNA samples from pooled organs and feathers of the same birds were amplified by realtime PCR and plotted to verify the linear correlation between the amplification values obtained with the two samples. The samples examined for MDV presence originated from 86 flocks in which the amplification values obtained with organ and feather tip DNAs correlated linearly at a high level of statistical significance (p < 0.001). The samples examined for CAV presence originated from 95 flocks in which the amplification values obtained with organ and feather tip DNAs also correlated linearly at a high level of statistical significance (p < 0.001) (Davidson I., unpublished) .",

Unlike the conventional end-point PCR (cPCR), whose final amplicon generation was detected at the end of the enzymatic reaction, therefore denoted as cPCR, by the qPCR the products are evident during the reaction. The qPCR technology proved to be more sensitive, allowing the detection of only few target molecules even in a mixture of excessive high levels of background DNA. Moreover, the qPCR allows quantitative genotyping and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms and allelic discrimination as well as genetic variations when only a small proportion of the sample carries the mutation. However, the development of qPCR is complex as, (a) it prerequisite accurate calibration for optimal performance, (b) use of adequate reference materials, (c) sensitivity of inhibitory compounds in the nucleic acid target sample, and more (Kralik and Ricchi, 2017) . Since more than a decade ago Deepak et al. (2017) described the dramatic leap in the use and application of the qPCR in various areas of biology and infectiology in humans, plants and animals. Similarly to the cPCR, the avian virology incorporated the various qPCR technologies in the study of all the known avian viruses and bacteria, and several examples will be mentioned below.",

The problem regarding the biological significance of quantification embraces a broader context. The main factor is the nature of the infecting pathogen. In case that the infection was caused by a zoonotic pathogen that is not allowed to be present, like in case of infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza, or salmonella, the quantification is warranted to determine the status and level of infection, and to determine the freedom of these pathogens and efficacy of vaccination or of various disinfection means. When the infection involve ubiquitous viruses, performing quantification of infection is less critical, although it can provide information on the level of infectivity, as the pathogen copy number influences the severity of clinical signs. Generally, pathogen quantification can indicate the vaccination efficacy on the background of infection with virulent wild-type pathogens. However, the need for quantification performance is not trivial in cases of sub-clinical infections. The performance of pathogen quantification has to be associated with the establishment of regulations regarding the permitted levels of pathogen presence, that will be associated by decisions regarding the need to take actions. In these cases clear criteria and action policies have to be formulated.",

Unlike other amplification assays, that met wide acceptance, the multiplex assays initiated multiple discussions and occasionally reluctance for acceptance of this technique. The reasons for skepticism was the prerequisite of careful optimization of the amplification reaction components in terms of concentration and annealing temperatures, in order to maintain the optimal specificity and sensitivity for each amplicon. In addition, multiplex amplification assays raised concerns regarding mutual interferences that might be caused due to reagent exhaustion in the reaction tube. For that reason scientists diverged, from enthusiastic developers of multiplexes containing more than two amplicons, to dismissal of the technique. However, at present the PCR reagents are more sophisticated than those that were available in former years. The currently obtainable reagents possess wide dynamic ranges of activity, and the calibration complications seem to be less critical than before. Modern reagents consist majorly of amplification pre-composed mixes, that contain sophisticated amplification enzymes and all components required. Moreover, primers and probes concentrations in the amplification reaction, in general, are in excess (Elfath et al., 2000) . Many studies employed dual multiplex amplifications for two viruses, including our studies that amplified quantitatively the MDV and CAV (Davidson et al., 2013) and ILTV and the fowlpox virus (FPV) from cases of diphteric manifestations in chickens (Fatumbi et al., 1995; Davidson et al., 2015) , or two genes of one virus, the TMEV (Davidson et al., 2017b) , An originally approach was the development of the multiplex qPCR on the level of two TaqMan probes in one tube to increase the sensitivity of detection of the MDV vaccine and wild type viruses (Davidson et al., 2017c) . Several other examples among numerous dual virus amplification assays are (a) the avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) quantitative multiplex subtype A or subtype B to assist in disease diagnosis and to carry out rapid surveillance with high levels of sensitivity and specificity (Cecchinato et al., 2013) , (b) Abdelwhab et al. (2010) developed therefore a versatile, sensitive and lineagespecific multiplex RT-qPCR for detection and typing of H5N1 viruses in Egypt.",

However, not many molecular DIVA system were developed for avian viruses by now, therefore that topic turn into a priority for future studies. DIVA assays were developed to provide differential molecular detection assays for vaccine and field viruses of ILTV (Shil et al., 2015) . Baigent et al. (2016) described the pp38 MDV DIVA real-time PCR for differential identification of MDV-1 vaccine DNAs from MDV-1 virulent isolate DNAs. That assay was developed using cell-cultured prototype viruses, however, and its employment on feather tip extracts of commercial chickens that have been vaccinated commercially, did not provided the desired differential specificity between the wild-type and the vaccine viruses. For that reason, the simultaneous use of both CVI and Vir3 probes was employed in one tube, as a multiplexed DIVA on the probe level, to provide a new more convenient for use assay (Davidson et al., 2017c) . We hypothesized that the competitive binding would provide increased stringency that extend the specificity and the distinctive ability of the DIVA assay. To enable the identification of the two amplifications in one tube, the CVI probe was labeled with a different reporter from the Vir3 probe, the CAL Fluor Gold 540, denoted CVI2 P. was confirmed on commercial samples. Indeed it gained a distinctive capacity between the two viruses (Davidson et al., 2017c) . To our knowledge, no Taq-Man qPCR DIVA assays are yet available using multiplexed probes in one tube. Therefore, the present assay contributes originality and additional diagnostic capacity.",

NGS is similar to Sanger sequencing as it allows to reveal the sequence of DNA fragments, but in NGS the acquisition of the sequences of all DNA fragments are obtained in parallel. This allows millions of fragments to be sequenced in a single run, as compared to the Sanger sequencing, which only produces one forward and reverse read.

Pyrosequencing relies on light detection based on a chain reaction, and then pyrophosphate is released. De Battisti et al. (2013) applied pyrosequencing to diagnose rapidly and to pathotype NDV directly in clinical specimens. NDV is the only member of serotype 1 avian paramyxoviruses (APMV-1) that causes respiratory and neurological disease in chickens and other species of birds and can cause severe economic losses in the poultry sector. Pathotyping is needed for NDV to characterize the infecting viruses. In this study degenerated primers were designed to amplify a portion of the fusion gene responsible for virulence, then a 30-bp region encompassing the cleavage site was pyrosequenced. Pyrosequencing analysis was a useful technique also for genotyping AIV reassortants in the search of vaccine virus candidates (Shcherbik et al., 2014) .",

As MDV is a cell-associated virus the CEFs has to be maintained intact for 7-10 days to support virus replication. For the retrovirus isolation, two serial passages in tissue culture are needed, where the first passage has to be frozen in order to free the intracellular virions for re-amplification in the second round of culture. Following that prolonged tissue culturing, the monolayers have to be fixed and immunostained with monoclonal antibodies and inspected for infection. By freezing the first tissue culture passage or the retrovirus isolation, the MDV which might be infected the CEF due to its co-existence in the original sample, would be destroyed as it requires intact cells.",

The most outstanding example for in vivo recombination, led to the creation of the new avian leukosis virus, subgroup J (ALV-J). ALV-J emerged following a spontaneous recombination between exogenous and endogenous retroviral sequences (Bai et al., 1995; Venugopal, 1999) . Very soon the new virus disseminated worldwide with the extensive international trade of the specific genetic breed, in which ALV-J was created, leading to a very severe outcome with a devastating economic impact on the poultry industry (Malkinson et al., 2004) . ALV-J genetic sequence revealed several recombinations between the exogenous ALV gag and pol genes and the env gene of the endogenous avian erythoblastosis virus (Bai et al., 1995; Benson et al., 1998; Fadly and Smith, 1999) . In the respect of viral evolution through genetic recombination, ALV-J represents a viable recombinant that occurred spontaneously in vivo between exogenous and endogenous avian retroviruses, ALV and AEV, respectively. While the LTR, gag and pol genes are highly homologous with other ALV subgroups, the env gene had only 40% identity with other exogenous ALV envs, but 75-95% homology with env-like genes of the endogenous avian retroviruses (EAV) family (Fadly and Payne, 2003) . A number of other in vivo recombination events between ALVs have been described; an ALV-J encoding an ALV-A envelope (Lupiani et al., 2003 (Lupiani et al., , 2006 , an acutely transforming isolate of ALV-J (Chesters et al., 2001) , a recombinant ALV containing the ALV-J sequence uncovered examples of in vivo recombination events between RNA viruses which commonly infect same lymphocytes in the chicken, as lately documented for the Australian breeding flocks which were co-infected with ALV-A and ALV-J (Bagust et al., 2004; Fenton et al., 2005) .",

Only a biological advantage would enable a recombinant virus to dominate in an infected bird. In addition, the in vivo herpes-retro recombination issue differs, and is rather more complex than in vitro co-cultivation of the two virus types; the cells in the in vitro co-infection were fibroblasts, whereas in vivo, the target cells are mostly lymphocytes and monocytes. While the recombination rate in vitro was rather high, the in vivo formation of viable recombinant viruses depends on the presence of host immune responses, tissue affinities, and more, therefore, the amounts of recombinant viruses is often minute.

We determined the occurrence of such integrations in vivo by following the presence of chimeric molecules. Several conditions were analysed: a) Commercial birds that acquired naturally a mixed infection; b) Experimentally infected chickens with prototype strains of MDV and ALV-J; c) Commercial chickens infected experimentally with virus inoculae obtained from commercial cases of double infection with MDV and ALV-J, in the same flock or the same bird. In the two first categories we found that integration events happened at various rates, depending on the experimental system used. While in commercial flocks the event was limited (about 2.5% of the 2926 DNA samples), it reached a 30-50% rate in experimentally-infected birds with prototype viruses, and was undetectable in experimentally-infected birds with field inoculae. It seemed that by increasing the virus adaptation to laboratory conditions, the rate of retrovirus LTR integration into MDV increases, as judged by the extent of chimeric molecules. Also, in each DNA preparation a variety of chimeric molecule types were detected, indicating the in vivo formation of molecular quasispecies in dually-infected birds.",

Kim and Tripathy (2001) analysed early isolates of FPV and showed that the event of REV integration into FPV occurred more than 50 years ago. However, REV envelope sequences have been detected only in FPV field strains, suggesting the presence of intact REV genome in wild-type strains. Unlike MDV, where the retroviral-LTR integrations occurred at various genetic sited within the junctions of the unique and repeat MDV genomic fragments, the retroviral-LTR integrations occur within the FPV genome at a specific site, between open reading frame 201 and 203 (Brunovskis and Kung, 1986; Garcia et al., 2003) . Up to this point it is not elucidated yet whether the emergence of new FPV isolates, the disease re-emergence and the apparent lack of vaccine efficacy are due to REV insertions. We havedemonstrated that most, but not all the FPV isolates in commercial flocks contained REV inserts of various sizes (2008c).",

These events might facilitate, in a yet unknown mechanism, transfer of genomic fragments between DNA viruses.

Neither of these two components can stand alone, as clinical diagnosis is not definitive without laboratory confirmation, while the latter is insignificant without at least one virus-specific clinical sign. Moreover, diagnosis based on macroscopic lesions might be heavily influenced by subjectivity, and might be indistinctive and insensitive, signs might be common to several diseases. Also, molecular diagnosis of virus infections virus enable the diagnosis even in absence of clinical signs or postmortem lesions. Nowadays, revolutionary technological developments contributed to creation of novel sophisticated diagnostic assays that are fast, sensitive and highly informative. However, a special attention should still be dedicated to the biotic factors in diagnosis, which might substantiate the correct diagnosis by performing the accurate sampling and approach in view of the pathogen and disease biology. Furthermore, with the availability of such powerful diagnostic means, it is questionable whether to employ classical virological procedures besides the molecular diagnosis. The response is positive, it is still needed to collect field viruses, to perform amplify those samples in embryonated eggs or in tissue cultures to obtain purified stocks of live viruses for future reference, and for use as the challenge in experimental infection trials. These experimental infection trials might be performed in search of the protection ability of new vaccines, or other future biological research. Furthermore, to determine the presence of live viruses virus replication has to be demonstrated. In these cases the molecular diagnosis is not the ultimate diagnostic mean, because molecular assays can also perform on viral nucleic acids that originate from inactivated or non-replicable viruses. Thus, classical virology toolbox receives considerable enhancement by technological innovations rather than being replaced by them.",
