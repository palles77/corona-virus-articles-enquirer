A common mechanism used by many is to transcribe viral subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. Transcription of sg mRNA2 in tombusviruses allows for expression of the p19 suppressor of gene silencing and p22 movement proteins. We have investigated the mechanism of transcription of this sg mRNA in Tomato bushy stunt virus and have determined that this process is facilitated by no less than three different RNA modules that are located throughout the viral genome. These RNA units perform distinct tasks and function via long-distance RNA-RNA interactions. Systematic deconstruction of the RNA network and analysis of related RNA promoter elements allowed us to identify fundamental properties necessary for productive sg mRNA2 transcription. Collectively, our results (i) establish specific roles for the different RNA components of a multipartite RNA-based control system, (ii) support a premature termination mechanism for tombusvirus sg mRNA transcription and (iii) reveal a close mechanistic relationship between sg mRNA transcription, viral RNA replication and RNA recombination.",

Their singlestranded messenger-sensed RNA genomes encode an assortment of proteins involved in various aspects of virus reproduction. Many of these proteins function at specific stages during infections and accordingly require regulated expression. Viruses that contain polycistronic RNA genomes regulate their gene expression primarily at the transcriptional level. They do so by transcribing genome-derived subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that act as messages for the translation of viral proteins encoded either internally or 3 0 -proximally in their genomes (Miller and Koev, 2000) . This strategy allows for the expression of downstream open reading frames (ORFs) that are normally translationally silent within a polycistronic context and is a mechanism utilized by a variety of ( \u00fe )-strand RNA viruses (Miller and Koev, 2000) .",

Sg mRNA synthesis is also carried out by vRdRps in a process referred to as transcription. Most sg mRNAs have 5 0 termini that map to internal genomic regions and 3 0 ends that are coterminal with the genome ( Figure 1A ). Three basic models have been proposed for sg mRNA transcription and two of these, internal initiation (Miller et al, 1985) and discontinuous template synthesis (DTS) (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998) , have been established convincingly (Miller et al, 1985; van Marle et al, 1999; Pasternak et al, 2001 ). The third model, premature termination (PT), is less well supported by experimental data, but has been implicated in a number of diverse virus groups (Zhong and Rueckert, 1993; Sit et al, 1998; Zhang et al, 1999; Price et al, 2000; Gowda et al, 2001) .",

This leads to the generation of a smaller (\u00c0)-strand RNA that is complementary to the sg mRNA. This sg mRNA-sized (\u00c0)strand (hereafter termed sg mRNA(\u00c0)) is then used as a template for transcription of the sg mRNA (White, 2002) ( Figure 1A ). The 'primary' sg mRNAs produced by this mechanism could potentially be amplified further via replication (White, 2002) . Different types of RNA-RNA interactions involving sequences located just upstream of sg mRNA start sites have been identified in viral genomes in which the PT model is proposed to operate (Sit et al, 1998; Choi et al, 2001; Gowda et al, 2001; Choi and White, 2002) . In some cases, these RNA interactions were found to be essential for efficient sg mRNA transcription and, as proposed originally for Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) (Sit et al, 1998) , could potentially act as roadblocks to mediate the vRdRp stalling/ dissociation that generates the sg mRNA(\u00c0) templates (Zhang et al, 1999; Choi et al, 2001; Choi and White, 2002; Lindenbach et al, 2002) .",

Its base-pairing partner RS1 is positioned just three nucleotides (nt) 5 0 to the sg mRNA1 start site and is directly adjacent to a conserved stem-loop structure, SL1sg1. In contrast, the previously identified DE-A/CE-A interaction that is necessary for efficient sg mRNA2 transcription occurs some 11 nt away from the start site for sg mRNA2 (Zhang et al, 1999) (Figure 2 ). This difference in spatial arrangement (11 versus 3 intervening nucleotides) led us to propose that sg mRNA2 transcription requires a third RNA element that base pairs within the 11 nt segment, designated CE-C, in a manner similar to the AS1/RS1 interaction (Choi and White, 2002) ( Figure 2) . Positionally, the sequence between RS1 and DE-A, termed DE-C, represented a good candidate ( Figure 2 ). However, in TBSV, this sequence exhibits no significant complementarity to CE-C. Furthermore, DE-Cs are highly variable in different tombusviruses, but in all cases they are not complementary to their corresponding CE-Cs (Choi et al, 2001) . Consequently, we hypothesized that this sequence maintains noncomplementarity in order to allow the missing RNA element unfettered access to CE-C.",

Modifications that would disrupt and then restore AS2/RS2 base pairing were introduced into the TBSV genome and their effect on sg mRNA2 accumulation was assayed in protoplast infections and quantified by Northern blot analysis ( Figure  3A and B). Substitutions in either AS2 (at degenerate codon positions) or RS2 that decreased their complementarity led to notably reduced sg mRNA2 levels (to B5 and 0%, respectively, relative to T100), while restoration of base pairing by combining the two substitutions resulted in partial recovery (B33%) ( Figure 3B ). The relative levels of accumulation of sg mRNA2(\u00c0) strands also corresponded closely with those of their ( \u00fe )-strand counterparts ( Figure 3B ). The reduced level of sg mRNA2 recovery observed for mutant A/RS2m1 could have been due to (i) a weaker AS2/RS2 interaction, (ii) the terminal loop modifications interfering with presentation of the AS2 residues and/or (iii) the substitutions causing either AS2 or RS2 to interact unproductively with other RNA sequences. Regardless, the six-fold or greater increase in the activity of A/RS2m1 over either AS2m1 or RS2m1 supports the importance of the AS2/RS2 interaction for sg mRNA2 transcription.",

Changing the UG pair to either UA or CG did not notably affect sg mRNA2 accumulation, whereas a CA substitution, which corresponds to a GU base pair in the (\u00c0)-strand, nearly abolished accumulation ( Figure 3C and D). Since the two substitutions in A/RS2m2A were tolerated well when present individually in RS2mA and AS2m2 ( Figure  3C and D), these results are best explained by the CA mismatch disrupting the AS2/RS2 interaction in the ( \u00fe )strand.

PY2, containing the noncomplementary sequence, was still fully functional for sg mRNA2 transcription (B104%) in comparison to its genomic control Psg20/26 (a modified TBSV genome containing an engineered restriction enzyme site). Unexpectedly, PY9, containing the complementary sequence, was also fully functional (B126%) ( Figure 4A ). This latter result could have been due to either AS2 maintaining its ability to bind to RS2 or the complementary segment in DE-C functionally replacing AS2. To distinguish between these two Northern blot analysis and quantification of ( \u00fe )-and (\u00c0)-strand viral RNA accumulation in protoplast infections. Following denaturation with glyoxal, total RNA extracts were separated in 1.4% agarose gels, transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with 32 P-labeled viral strandspecific probes. Note that, although the ( \u00fe )-and (\u00c0)-strands are presented with similar intensities, (\u00c0)-strand viral RNAs actually accumulate in vivo to significantly lower levels than ( \u00fe )-strands. The values correspond to means from three independent experiments and represent the ratios of sg mRNA2 levels to their corresponding genomic RNA levels, all normalized to that for T100. possibilities, an additional modification was introduced into both PY2 and PY9 that inactivated AS2 ( Figure 4A ). Analysis of the double mutants, PY2-AS2m1 and PY9-AS2m1, respectively, revealed that PY2-AS2m1 was still AS2-dependent, whereas PY9-AS2m1 was not ( Figure 4A ). Thus, DE-C can be modified to act as a competitive inhibitor of AS2 and can, concurrently, functionally replace AS2. Compensatory mutational analysis of the engineered DE-C/RS2 interaction confirmed its role in mediating sg mRNA2 transcription ( Figure 4B ).",

            "text": "A local RNA hairpin structure can functionally replace the AS2/RS2 interaction The surprising result that the AS2/RS2 interaction was dispensable for sg mRNA2 transcription prompted us to wonder whether a more radical structural replacement would also be functional. To investigate this possibility, we introduced different-sized RNA hairpins 3 nt upstream of the sg mRNA2 start site in a genomic context that had AS2 inactivated by substitutions ( Figure 5A ). The modified genome context used, Psg2-27, also had CE-A and -B deleted; thus any transcriptional activity detected would be independent of the DE/CE interactions formed by these subelements (refer to Figure 2 ). No detectable sg mRNA2 was observed for the genome containing the 4 bp stem (HL56); however, those with longer stems of 8 (Lsg2), 12 (HL45) and 16 bp (HL87) directed increasing levels of sg mRNA2 accumulation, underscoring the importance of helix length and/or stability ( Figure 5A ). The critical role of stem formation was confirmed through compensatory mutational analysis of the 8 bp hairpin ( Figure 5B ), while an important role for helix stability was supported by the increased activity observed when the 12 bp hairpin was converted to all GC base pairs in mutant HL78 ( Figure 5A ). The identity of the residues in the helix did not appear to be essential since HL57, with the lower 8 bp in its stem transposed, exhibited only moderately reduced levels of sg mRNA2 accumulation, compared with HL45 ( Figure 5A ). Strand-preferential destabilization of the helix in HL78 revealed that, similar to the wt AS2/RS2 interaction, it was far more sensitive to ( \u00fe )-than to (\u00c0)-strand disruption, supporting a ( \u00fe )-strand function ( Figure 5C ).",

In wt T100, sg mRNA2 accumulated to detectable levels before sg mRNA1 and the appearance of sg mRNA2 coincided with that of the genome ( Figure 6 ). The early (2-11 h) accumulation rates of genomic and sg mRNAs for T100, Psg20/26 and PY9-AS2m1 were very similar; however, viral RNA levels were clearly higher at later time points (15-24 h) for PY9-AS2m1 ( Figure 6 ). For HL78, a lower relative level of sg mRNA2 was evident and the initial appearance of all viral RNAs was delayed by B2 h (Figure 6 ). This delay was not related to its Psg2-27-based genomic context, since the timing of early accumulation of genomic and sg mRNA1 for Psg2-27 was similar to that for T100 ( Figure 6 ). The very low levels of sg mRNA2 for Psg2-27 is expected due to the absence of the critical CE-A and important CE-B subelements in this modified genome (Zhang et al, 1999) . Overall, this time-course analysis suggests that (i) the engineered DE-C/RS2 interaction functions similarly to the wt AS2/RS2 interaction at early time points, but causes increased accumulation of all viral RNAs later in the infection, and (ii) genomes containing the engineered 12 bp hairpin show delayed accumulation of all viral RNAs and a lower relative level of sg mRNA2; however, sg mRNA2 still appears earlier than sg mRNA1.",

Interestingly, RNA B, a 5 0 -truncated derivative of DI-72 lacking region I, is still able to replicate at low levels (B10% that of DI-72) in coinoculations with the wt TBSV genome . Structurally, the 5 0 end of RNA B corresponds to an internal region of DI-72, whereas its 3 0 end is coterminal with DI-72 ( Figure 7A ). This basic structural correspondence is analogous to that of a sg mRNA relative to its cognate viral genome. However, in contrast to sg mRNAs, RNA B is not detectable in coinfections of DI-72 and TBSV genome ( Figure 7B, lane 3) ; thus, RNA B is not normally produced during DI-72 replication. To test whether RNA B could be 'launched' from a DI RNA molecule in a manner comparable to sg mRNA transcription, the active hairpin-based cassette from Lsg2 ( Figure 5A ) was inserted between regions I and II in DI-72, thereby generating HL65 ( Figure 7A ). As a control, another DI 72-based molecule was constructed, HL69, which contained an unstructured sequence of similar length inserted at the same position. RNA B was not detected when HL69 was coinoculated with T100; however, it was clearly present in coinoculations with HL65 ( Figure 7B ). The importance of the small helix for the production of RNA B was confirmed by compensatory mutational analysis ( Figure 7A and B). This ability of the 8 bp hairpin cassette to mediate RNA B production from a DI RNA suggests that this cassette contains all of the structural properties required for local context-independent activity. Additionally, we have found that substitution of the initiating nucleotide in this cassette leads to cessation of ( \u00fe )-but not (\u00c0)-strand RNA B synthesis (unpublished data), which is consistent with the concept that the hairpin structure specifically mediates production of (\u00c0)-strand templates.",

Since the 5 0 UTR of the genome is also involved in translational regulation (Fabian and White, 2004) , we chose to investigate this sequence in the context of a nontranslated DI RNA, DI-72 ( Figure 7C ). Interestingly, previous analysis of the SL5 Figure 6 Accumulation profile of TBSV viral RNAs over time in infected protoplasts. Total RNA preparations were isolated at various times (in hours) postinfection (p.i.), as indicated above the lanes, and analyzed by Northern blotting. The positions of genomic and sg mRNAs are indicated to the left, while the genomes used in the infections are listed to the right. structure in a DI-72 context revealed that strengthening the UG base pair at the bottom of its stem via substitution results in the accumulation of an additional small viral RNA, which was not characterized (Ray et al, 2003) . Considering its structural similarity to our functional hairpin element, we wondered whether the stabilizing substitutions were causing it to become 'transcriptionally' active. To investigate this possibility, we characterized the smaller viral RNA generated. Northern blot analysis revealed that this additional RNA, termed RNA-SL5, was clearly larger than the previously characterized RNA B and contained the 3 0 -terminal end of the DI RNA and sequences just downstream, but not upstream, of SL5 ( Figure 7D ). Primer-extension analysis mapped the 5 0 terminus of RNA-SL5 to position G 111 , which is the predicted initiation site if the SL5 element was functioning analogously to our transcriptional hairpin cassettes ( Figure 7E ). These results suggest that at least one cryptic transcriptional element is present within the TBSV genome and that its activity is downregulated by helix destabilization, probably to avoid production of unnecessary and possibly deleterious viral RNAs.",

The complement of the 5 0terminal 11 nt in DI-72 corresponds to the core genomic ( \u00fe )-strand promoter, cPR (Panavas et al, 2002) ; thus the similarity observed between the 5 0 -terminal genomic and sg mRNA sequences suggests that the complement of this sg mRNA segment may also function as a ( \u00fe )-strand promoter. To test this idea, we replaced the 5 0 -terminal 11 nt of the DI RNA with the corresponding 5 0 -terminal sequence of sg mRNA2 or a random sequence, thereby generating HL47 and HL49, respectively ( Figure 8B ). HL47 was able to replicate and accumulate to wt DI RNA levels, whereas HL49 did not accumulate to detectable levels ( Figure 8C ).

As before, these studies were carried out in the context of a DI RNA ( Figure 8D ). In HL84, a 164 nt long 5 0 extension was added to DI-72 and this greatly reduced its accumulation to B5% that of the wt DI-72 ( Figure  8D and E). However, when the 8 bp hairpin cassette was added just upstream of the internally located 5 0 terminus, the accumulation level of the resulting mutant, HL89, increased by B10-fold compared with that of HL84 ( Figure 8D and E). The importance of the hairpin component of the cassette for mediating efficient DI RNA accumulation was confirmed by compensatory mutagenesis (Figure 8D and E). These results indicate that a hairpin-based cassette can substantially rescue a replication defect caused by an inhibitory 5 0 -terminal extension.",

A similarly structured stem-loop is also involved in transactivation of transcription in RCNMV (Sit et al, 1998) . In TBSV, the AS2 and AS1 stem-loops are positioned tandemly and, thus, could potentially operate as a unit. However, inactivation of either AS1 or AS2 does not appreciably affect the ability of the other to mediate transcription (Choi and White, 2002) (Figure 3) .

Importantly, this sg mRNA2-derived promoter was able to function without any (\u00c0)-strand sequences 3 0 -proximal to it, a finding consistent with the AS2/ RS2 interaction (i) not constituting part of the transcriptional promoter in the (\u00c0)-strand and (ii) acting as an RdRp terminator in the ( \u00fe )-strand.

Interestingly, poor activity from internal sites seems to be a property shared by both transcriptional and ( \u00fe )-strand replication promoters. The reason for this could be that in an internal context the promoters are less accessible to the TBSV vRdRp due to confinement in a putative double-stranded RNA replication intermediate and/ or that the vRdRp has a strong 3 0 -end dependence.

The AS2/RS2 helix serves as the major secondary structure-dependent RNA termination signal for the vRdRp, and the sg mRNA2(\u00c0) template generated is used subsequently for sg mRNA2 transcription via initiation at the 3 0 -terminal promoter (PSG). Sg mRNA1 transcription is also thought to occur via a similar mechanism that involves the essential AS1/RS1 interaction ( Figure 9A ).",

Although not essential for function, this dispersed organization has been selected over time by nature based on performance. A network of long-distance interactions could offer certain advantages, such as (i) providing a more efficient system for sg mRNA transcription, (ii) allowing for better regulation of transcription and/or (iii) facilitating and/or coordinating additional viral processes. For TBSV sg mRNA2, the hairpin-based elements mediated transcription less efficiently than the wt long-distance interactions. Also, the hairpin elements caused a delay in early expression of sg mRNA2 (and also of other viral mRNAs). These highly reproducible differences, although subtle, could have significant effects on virus fitness in nature. Indeed, the early and efficient transcription of sg mRNA2 is probably beneficial to infections by facilitating rapid suppression of gene silencing by the encoded p19 and swift invasion of neighboring cells by p22.",

The hybrid (\u00c0)-strand formed by covalent joining of noncontiguous 5 0 -and 3 0 -terminal segments is then used for transcription of sg mRNAs ( Figure 9B ).

The RNA hairpin in the BEV genome maps immediately upstream of the 3 0 junction site in BEV sg mRNA 2; thus, it has been suggested that this hairpin could facilitate the transposition step in the proposed DTS model (van Vliet et al, 2002) ( Figure 9B ). The BEV hairpin may function in a manner similar to the AS2/RS2 helix in the TBSV genome; therefore, local and long-distance RNA secondary structures may act in DTS and PT mechanisms, respectively, to mediate vRdRp stalling that leads to either transposition or termination. The functional equivalence of local and long-distance RNA secondary structures in mediating vRdRp stalling/termination is well supported by the data in this article. Additionally, the proposed transposition-promoting activity of RNA secondary structure is corroborated by previous studies that showed that stable RNA hairpins can promote vRdRp-mediated recombination events in TBSV (White and Morris, 1995) (Figure 9C ). It is interesting to note that, mechanistically, the hairpin-mediated recombination event reported previously for TBSV is the intermolecular equivalent of the hairpin-mediated DTS transcriptional mechanism proposed for BEV (compare Figure 9B and C). The inter-relatedness and mechanistic similarities of these processes point to a common role for RNA secondary structure in defining RNA termini and junction sites in transcriptional and recombinational events through modulation of vRdRp activity.",
