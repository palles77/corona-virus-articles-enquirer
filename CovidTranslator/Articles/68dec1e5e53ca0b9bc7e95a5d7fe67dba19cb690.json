Phylogenetic analysis can be a valid approach for the identification of transmission chains, and very-large data sets can be analysed through parallel computation. Here we propose and validate a new methodology for the partition of large-scale phylogenies and the inference of transmission clusters. This approach, on the basis of a depth-first search algorithm, conjugates the evaluation of node reliability, tree topology and patristic distance analysis. The method has been applied to identify transmission clusters of a phylogeny of 11,541 human immunodeficiency virus-1 subtype B pol gene sequences from a large Italian cohort. molecular transmission chains were characterized by means of different clinical/demographic factors, such as the interaction between male homosexuals and male heterosexuals. our method takes an advantage of a flexible notion of transmission cluster and can become a general framework to analyse other epidemics. ,15 on behalf of the ARCA collaborative group ARTICLE nATuRE CommunICATIons |",

In brief, after calculating the whole-tree distance distribution, the depth-first ( Fig. 1 ) starts from a root node and moves into a sub-tree, checking its reliability, number of leaves and calculating the sub-tree distribution. If the clustering conditions are not met, the algorithm goes deeper into another child sub-tree, otherwise it stops, and the leaves of the current sub-tree are placed in a cluster. Then the search restarts from the most recent sub-tree that has not been visited. If a leaf is reached, no clusters are identified for that path. Graphical example of a depth-first tree search for automated phylogenetic tree partition. The method considers nodes/sub-trees with a reliability \u2265 90% and \u2265 2 distinct patients, recognizing a sub-tree as a cluster when the median sub-tree pairwise patristic distance is below a percentile threshold of the whole-tree patristic distance distribution (let it be the 10th percentile).

At thresholds below the 30th percentile, the maximum cluster size was always inferior to the number of un-clustered isolates ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Thus, the 30th percentile threshold behaved as a break-point: all subsequent analyses yielded similar results across lower thresholds, whereas the same did not always held when considering both thresholds above and below the break-point.

Sequences without epidemiological information were ignored, and only the earliest available sequence per patient was considered. Each cluster was evaluated checking if it was composed exclusively either by a single or by a mixture of different demographic factors. The estimated proportions were then compared against those that would be expected by chance after randomly shuffling the cluster indices. We found an excess in the proportion of clusters composed solely by patients living in the Northern Italy (31 versus 17%, P < 0.0001), by those living in the Central Italy (25 versus 16%, P = 0.0008), by male homosexuals (27 versus 16%, P < 0.0001), by male homosexuals and heterosexuals together (20 versus 10%, P < 0.0001), by patients infected recently (within three years from the first HIV-1 positive test, 35 versus 19%, P < 0.0001), by ARTnaive patients without any drug-resistance mutation (15 versus 6%, P < 0.0001), by patients with high HIV-1 RNA load (above 10,000 copies per ml, 43 versus 34%, P = 0.02), by patients carrying at least one resistance mutation to nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI) (26 versus 19%, P = 0.007; 10 versus 6%, P = 0.02, respectively). Conversely, we observed a proportion significantly lower than expected for clusters comprising male homosexuals and injecting drug users (IDUs) together (3 versus 9%, P < 0.0001), male homosexuals and heterosexuals and IDU together (11 versus 25%, P < 0.0001), and patients living in the Northern Italy and in the Central Italy (27 versus 42%, P < 0.0001). Notably, although the proportions of clusters composed by patients either naive or carrying any drug-resistance mutation were exceeding those expected by chance, along with the mixtures of ART-exposed/ART-naive and patients with/without resistance, there was no excess in the proportion of naive patients carrying any drug-resistance mutation (2 versus 2%, P = 0.898).

On the contrary, the presence of at least one drug-resistance mutation to NRTI and PI was not associated with clustering. The mode of HIV transmission was the factor that exhibited opposite behaviours by varying the threshold: at low thresholds male homosexuals and heterosexuals tended to cluster more than IDU, whereas the contrary held at higher thresholds.

This approach conjugates the evaluation of node reliability, tree topology and patristic distance analysis. Previous approaches have lacked, in general, not only a standardized definition of a transmission cluster, but also a formal algorithmic procedure for the detection of reliable transmission clusters within a phylogeny. In the studies by Lewis et al. 15 and Hughes et al., 17 clusters were identified on large data sets using a fixed threshold on genetic distances, and then confirmed by phylogenetic trees constructed afterwards. Another approach was the CTree algorithm 24 , originally applied to viral sub-typing, which does not account for node reliability and is not applicable to large data sets in its current implementation. Other available methods have used different cluster selection schemes by performing nested phylogenetic analyses, and/or adding criteria for geographical consistency [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , but in most cases the assessment of transmission clusters is still subject to a visual tree inspection. The definition of a transmission cluster proposed here is general and can be tuned to accommodate any of the previous definitions. The method can be of interest for epidemiologists because obtained partitions could be used in multi-level modelling.",

The transmission clusters detected in our study population were preferentially composed either by male homosexuals only or by male homosexuals and heterosexuals together. As male homosexuals (and presumably male bisexuals) are a primary source of the cluster composition, this could be considered for designing targeted population screenings and interventions. On the other hand, there was a negative association between male homosexuals/heterosexuals and IDU. We found that ART-naive patients cluster both with other ART-naive and with ART-experienced patients, in various configurations with respect to the carriage of drug-resistance mutation. Although the direc-tion of the transmission cannot easily be inferred, the proportion of clusters composed exclusively by ART-naive patients carrying at least one drug-resistance mutation in our population study (so presumably transmitting the resistance to each other) was \u22482%, a low proportion, comparable to a previous estimation in the United Kingdom 16 . A substantial responsibility of drug-resistance transmission is still carried by the ART-experienced population, suggesting that any decrease in the prevalence of drug-resistance in the ARTexperienced population could translate into a reduction of the proportion of new infections with drug-resistant virus.",

            "text": "The association of a recent HIV-1 positive test with transmission clustering could be simply due to the fact that in these individuals the intra-host viral evolution is at an early stage and thus it is easier to trace the possible transmission source. Another possibility, however, is that some newly infected patients might not be aware of being infected, and therefore continue to engage in risky sexual behaviours. Recently, infected and untreated patients are also more likely to have higher viral loads, resulting in higher probability of transmission 6 . Thus, efforts to expand HIV-1 testing programmes should be a successful strategy to reduce the rates of HIV-1 transmission. Concomitantly, the association of higher HIV-1 RNA loads and CD4 + counts with transmission clustering emphasizes the need of early diagnoses and suggests how early treatment may be useful in reducing HIV-1 transmission events. This work has some limitations. First, epidemiological conclusions may change slightly or dramatically depending on the choice of the threshold. By evaluating the algorithm on different data sets, and using different definitions of a transmission cluster, the optimal threshold spanned a large range, from 0.04 to 0.08 nucleotide substitutions per site, whereas previous studies used more stringent criteria (either 0.015 or 0.031) 18, 21 . Ideally, a transmission chain, at least in the context of a single subtype phylogeny of HIV-1 isolates, should be defined by an absolute threshold. At the moment, the lack of epidemiologically confirmed data precludes such a precise estimation. Nonetheless, the present method offers a rational validation strategy to identify an appropriate cutoff, depending on the specific data set under investigation and on the (strict or loose) definition of a transmission cluster. Second, complete demographic and clinical information were missing for a relevant proportion of patients enrolled in ARCA. A non-uniform sequence sampling has most likely occurred overtime. Most of the sequences included in our analysis were derived from ART-experienced patients tested at virological failure. Although repeated measures and convergent evolution due to treatments were accounted for, the analysis lacked a sample contribution from recently infected patients. Sampling could potentially distort results when analysing factors associated with transmission chains 20 . Finally, the partition method is fully dependent on the phylogenetic tree: if the tree is unreliable, then so is the cluster identification. The estimation of highly resolved and reliable phylogenies from large data sets is still a challenge and requires massively parallelized routines, especially for maximum likelihood or Bayesian tree inference. For this reason, the approach based on nested phylogenies might be still a preferable choice.",

In particular, HCV is one of the fastest growing pandemics and its evolutionary rate, genetic heterogeneity and risk transmission factors are similar to HIV-1. Given the upcoming availability of HCV antivirals, surveillance of drug-resistance and analysis of transmission clusters using standardized algorithms are expected to be of outstanding interest in the near future. Finally, the algorithm described here can potentially be used in the study of intra-host phylogeniesespecially for the characterization of infected cellular reservoirs and compartments in viruses such as HIV [33] [34] [35] [36] or simian immu-nodeficiency virus 37 -in terms of viral fitness, emergence of drug resistance and pathogenesis. Sequence analysis. Viral subtype was assigned by using the Rega subtyping tool (http://www.bioafrica.net/rega-genotype/html/subtypinghiv.html). All sequences classified as subtype B, excluding any putative recombinant form, were aligned using the parallel implementation of ClustalW 38 , and manually edited. Resistance to an antiretroviral class (nucleoside-tide/non-nucleoside/protease inhibitors) was defined as the presence of at least one major mutation conferring resistance to at least one drug belonging to that class according to the 2009 update of the International AIDS Society reference list (http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/ mutations_figures.pdf). Deduced amino-acid mixtures including a major resistance mutation were considered as indicative of resistance, unless otherwise specified. Columns of the multiple alignment corresponding to codon positions associated to drug-resistance were removed.",
