Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need to understand the biological behavior of the virus and provide a basis for developing effective therapies. Since the proteome of the virus was determined, some of the protein structures could be determined experimentally, and others were predicted via template-based modeling approaches. However, tertiary structures for several proteins are still not available from experiment nor they could be accurately predicted by template-based modeling because of lack of close homolog structures. Previous efforts to predict structures for these proteins include efforts by DeepMind and the Zhang group via machine learning-based structure prediction methods, i.e. AlphaFold and C-I-TASSER.

Such insight at the molecular level, allows those proteins to be exploited as therapeutic targets by identifying either already approved drug molecules that could be repurposed or discovering new drug candidates via computational methods such as virtual screening. Since the SARS-CoV-2 infection reached pandemic level since early 2020, there is now an urgent need for highresolution structures of this virus. As protein sequences for the virus proteome were determined quickly 1 , some of the protein structures could be obtained experimentally. However, experimental structures of many proteins are still not available to date, leaving prediction via computational methods as the only alternative. SWISS-MODEL 2 could predict tertiary structure models for a subset of proteins by relying on template-based modeling techniques. since many of the genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are close homologs to proteins in other organisms with known structures. However, for some of the proteins, template-based modeling is not possible because of lack of experimentally determined close homologs. Recently, the prediction of tertiary structures for proteins where no template structures are available, has been advanced significantly via novel machine learning methods 3 . This approach predicts interresidue distances from multiple sequence alignment via deep learning. Using this approach, DeepMind applying the AlphaFold method 3 to make predictions for six proteins, where close homolog structures are not available 4 . In addition, the Zhang group predicted models for the entire proteome 5 , including targets for which no homologs can be identified, by using the novel C-I-TASSER platform 6 , which is a combined method of contact-based and template-based modeling.",

This may be expected as the modeled proteins were very difficult to predict. However, there is consensus on some of the proteins. For the domain of Papainlike proteinase (PL-PRO), residues 1763-1927, ours and AlphaFold's model resemble each other with a C\u0251-RMSD of 2.96 \u212b. Moreover, for one of the domains of nsp4, residues 274-399, ours and AlphaFold's model have the same topology, an \u03b1-helix bundle with the only significant difference being the orientation of the N-terminal helix (residues 274-309) that led to an overall difference between the structures of 8.27 \u212b in C\u0251-RMSD. Moreover, the membrane glycoprotein structure was also predicted with a similar topology between our protocol and AlphaFold with presumed trans-membrane Nterminal helices in a similar orientation and a globular C-terminal domain for residues 117-203 with a similar \u03b2-strand topology. The difference between our model and the AlphaFold prediction was 8.69 \u212b in C\u0251-RMSD mainly because of the orientation of two beta-strands (residues 117-133). Except for these cases, none of the structures shared a same topology.

All of the models generated from our modeling pipeline has less than 1.5 MolProbity score. Especially, steric clashes and rotamer outliers, rarely exist. Most of the AlphaFold models also have good MolProbity scores, although there are sometimes a few numbers of steric clashes between atoms and some rotamer outliers. After refining those models, most of the poor local geometries could be resolved, and the resulting MolProbity scores after refinement of the AlphaFold models are very good. In contrast to these models, models from Zhang group have poor local geometries as measured by the MolProbity score. These models have numerous atomic clashes, poor side-chain conformations, and bad backbone dihedral angles that generally suggest poor stereochemistry.
