If not properly accounted for, recombination can compromise many evolutionary analyses. In addition, when dealing with organisms that are not obligately sexually reproducing, recombination gives insight into the rate at which distinct genetic lineages come into contact. Since June 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 1,106 laboratory-confirmed infections, with 421 MERS-CoV-associated deaths as of 16 April 2015. Although bats are considered as the likely ultimate source of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, dromedary camels have been consistently implicated as the source of current human infections in the Middle East. In this article, we use phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that MERS-CoV genome has likely undergone numerous recombinations recently. Recombination in MERS-CoV implies frequent co-infection with distinct lineages of MERS-CoV, probably in camels given the current understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology.",

For some outbreaks, there is little reason to suspect recombination, e.g. negative sense single-stranded RNA viruses are thought to recombine over evolutionary, not populationlevel, time scales (Chare, Gould, and Holmes 2003) . Observable recombination in RNA viruses requires that two conditions are met that viruses from distinct lineages co-infect a host and that a mechanism for recombination exists. For example, even though influenza A virus co-infection is extremely common in birds based on genome segment reassortment patterns (Li et al. 2004; Dong et al. 2011; Lu, Lycett, and Brown 2014) , recombination is extremely rare or absent (Chare, Gould, and Holmes 2003; Boni et al. 2010) . This is thought to be because template switching (Kirkegaard and Baltimore 1986; Baric et al. 1987) , the main mechanism of recombination in RNA viruses, is mechanistically difficult for single-stranded negative sense RNA viruses (Chare, Gould, and Holmes 2003) , and for influenza A viruses has only been convincingly shown in cell culture under extreme conditions (Mitnaul et al. 2000) . When the genomic architecture of a virus is permissive to recombination, i.e. template switching occurs and is detectable, the extent of recombination is informative of co-infection and/or duration of infection.",

            "text": "Here, we focus our attention on the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Zaki et al. 2012 ), a recent zoonotic infection with a relatively high case fatality ratio (Assiri et al. 2013; Memish et al. 2013; Cauchemez et al. 2014) . Most human infections with MERS-CoV are thought to be the result of contact with Camelus dromedarius L., the dromedary camel, which is the presumed host of the virus. MERS-CoV, much like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is likely ultimately derived from bats (Corman et al. 2014a ). MERS-CoV, along with Murine hepatitis virus and SARS-CoV, belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus. Betacoronavirus as well as two other genera (Alpha-and Gammacoronavirus) out of four within the subfamily Coronavirinae have been shown to recombine in cell culture, in vivo, and in eggs (Lai et al. 1985; Makino et al. 1986; Keck et al. 1988; Kottier, Cavanagh, and Britton 1995; Herrewegh et al. 1998 ). Additionally, a coronavirus lineage related to MERS-CoV which was isolated from bats appears to have recombined around the spike (S) protein (Corman et al. 2014a) . In this article, we show that although the genome of MERS-CoV contains considerable amounts of rate heterogeneity between genomic regions that can interfere with detection of recombination, we do nonetheless find evidence of sustained recombination that cannot be explained by rate heterogeneity alone. This has two important consequences: one is that care has to be taken when constructing phylogenetic trees of MERS-CoV as a single tree cannot accurately describe the complete history of all loci within a recombining genome. Secondly and more importantly, the observed rates of recombination in the MERS-CoV genome is evidence of a large number of MERS-CoV co-infections in some hosts which has implications for understanding the dynamics of the virus in the animal reservoir.",

Other than that, all simulations were run under a relaxed lognormal molecular clock (Drummond et al. 2006) with standard deviation set to 7.42 \u00c2 10 -7 , HKY substitution model (Hasegawa, Kishino, and Yano 1985) with the transition/transversion ratio parameter (j) set to 6.0 and C-distributed rate heterogeneity with four categories and shape parameter 0.04 and empirical nucleotide frequencies, all derived from the results of the marginal likelihood analyses described earlier. A MERS-CoV sequence isolated from a camel (NRCE-HKU270) was provided as the starting state at the root. To include the effects of site-specific constraint, we additionally carried out simulations under a Goldman-Yang codon model (Goldman and Yang 1994) in pBUSS with empirical codon frequencies, j \u00bc 6.0 and dN/dS (x) set to 0.1 (i.e. purifying selection) under same levels of rate heterogeneity and on the same phylogeny as the simulations described above. As these sequences were simulated on a tree of MERS-CoV, we refer to these datasets as being empirically simulated.

Briefly, we consider the host to act as a polymorphic site (encoded as H or C, for human and camel, respectively) and compare the association between the 'allele' or host and alleles at polymorphic sites. A perfect association of 1.0 could mean, for example, that a biallelic site has one allele that is only found in camel viruses and the other allele only in human viruses. Five out of six empirical simulation alignments under a nucleotide model simulated without recombination were identified by GARD as having breakpoints around position 20000, where the clock rate for the rest of the 'genome' was increased to be 1.3, 2, or 3 times higher than the first 20 kb. Similarly, two of six alignments empirically simulated under a codon model were identified as having a breakpoint. Corrected DAIC values decreased with decreasing rate heterogeneity, indicating loss of statistical power to detect differences between genomic regions. Analyses in BEAST, where the MERS-CoV genome is partitioned into positions 1-23722 and positions 23723-30126 (corresponding to the first GARD-inferred breakpoint) with each partition having an independent molecular clock rate but the same tree or both independent molecular clock rates and independent trees, showed that rate heterogeneity as expressed by the ratio of second fragment rate to first fragment rate to be on the order of 1.513 (95% highest posterior density 1.275, 1.769) for unlinked clocks and 1.375 (95% HPDs: 1.079-1.707) for unlinked clocks and trees (see Supplementary Fig. S2 ).

GARD (Fig. 1) identified two breakpoints in the genome with high support. It is important to note that calculating the likelihood of a phylogenetic tree involves the estimation of multiple parameters, which at the very least must include a particular tree topology and a set of branch lengths. As such, we considered that the inference of a breakpoint in the MERS-CoV genome could be caused by systematic rate heterogeneity, which we address by evaluating rate heterogeneity across the first breakpoint in BEAST. We estimate an empirical rate heterogeneity ratio between MERS-CoV genome positions 23723-30126 and 1-23722 to be on the order between 1.3 and 1.5 (see Supplementary Fig. S2 ). However, the support for this first breakpoint in MERS-CoV is comparable to support for empirically simulated sequences with 2-fold rate heterogeneity, and breakpoints under MERS-like levels of rate heterogeneity are difficult to detect. Overall, this suggests that evidence for differences in likelihoods between MERS Fragments 1 and 2 are beyond what would be expected from rate heterogeneity alone.",

Through sequence simulation, we also confirmed that both the numbers of homoplasic sites and their homoplasy degrees in MERS-CoV genomes are excessive, even when compared with unrealistic scenarios (e.g. 3-fold rate heterogeneity, Fig. 4) . Homoplasies become increasingly more prevalent when a more realistic codon model is used, due to differences in codon position constraint. Even then, MERS-CoV genomes possess mutations with much higher homoplasy degrees, surpassing simulated datasets with caricature levels of rate heterogeneity. This makes sense under a recombination scenario, as alleles persist in a diverse population and get recombined into novel backgrounds repeatedly, giving an appearance of highly repeatable mutations. Nevertheless, substitution patterns in real genomes are often highly complex and homoplasy-based methods have been shown to be susceptible to rate heterogeneity across sites, especially under higher levels of sequence divergence (Posada and Crandall 2001) . Although rate heterogeneity certainly exists in MERS-CoV data, Figure 2 . Summary of non-parametric tests for recombination. The percentile of the observed value for four statistics of LD decay (y axis) in the distribution of permuted datasets is indicated by color. Sequence datasets are shown on the x axis, starting with MERS-CoV sequences, followed by ten fastsimcoal2-simulated datasets and twelve empirically simulated datasets with different degrees of rate heterogeneity. Expected values for ideal datasets are shown in the last two columns, an ideal positive corresponds to the presence of recombination. Values falling between the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile are shown in green, values falling below the 2.5th percentile are in blue, those that are above the 97.5th percentile in red. the divergence levels are still quite low (h/site \u00bc 0.0047), giving us some degree of certainty in our inference of homoplasies. It is also reassuring that both maximum likelihood and Bayesian sequence reconstruction converged on similar patterns of homoplasy and synapomorphy across the genome (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S7 ). This is important, since homoplasies inferred using BEAST are integrated over all possible tree topologies, whereas homoplasies inferred by maximum likelihood were conditioned on a single tree. The convergence between these two methods suggests that the data contain enough phylogenetic signal to recover what could be called a 'true' tree and that homoplasies, for the most part, can be correctly identified as such.",

The majority of homoplasies that we observe, however, occur on their own. Recombination tracts, rather than single template switches, are not uncommon in other coronaviruses (Keck et al. 1988; Kottier, Cavanagh, and Britton 1995; Herrewegh et al. 1998) .

At first, this may seem paradoxical, but we believe this result is due to the combined effects of the way homoplasious sites are distributed across the genome and phylogenetic tree of MERS-CoV (Fig. 5 ) and the number of parameters involved. A speckled pattern of homoplasious sites without phylogenetic signal could easily be overwhelmed by the signal coming from the sites that support what could be called 'the one true tree', i.e. the clonal frame, in the data. Second, each phylogenetic tree contains at least n \u00c0 1 free parameters, so it is not surprising then that models attempting to recover two independent trees for both genomic fragments resulting from alternative tree topology analysis of MERS-CoV with highly correlated genealogies are penalized for the extra parameters introduced by a second tree. We would additionally like to point out that the fit of models including relaxed molecular clocks result in dramatic improvements to model fit compared to models with strict molecular clocks (log BF > 15, Fig. 6 ). Although this could be interpreted as evidence for a considerable degree of lineage rate heterogeneity, the more parsimonious explanation is the ability of a relaxed molecular clock to accommodate homoplasies of recombinant origin, which do not necessarily accumulate at a relatively constant rate like genuine de novo mutations do.",

This highlights the advantage of employing relaxed molecular clocks, as in our case the method is clearly capable of accommodating recombination in an otherwise entirely clonal analysis framework. In addition, previous studies of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats have identified recombination breakpoints in small numbers of isolates falling close to the 'transition zone' around site 22000 (Hon et al. 2008; Lau et al. 2010) which in our analysis of MERS-CoV is where GARD, LDhat, and BEAST identify changes in the underlying model of evolution (Figs. 1 and 3 and Supplementary  Fig. S5 ).

For this to occur, different lineages of the virus must encounter each other often and implies frequent co-infection with MERS-CoV. To date, it is difficult to ascertain whether the human infections with MERS-CoV are a result of substantial asymptomatic transmission among humans or repeated zoonosis of the virus from camels to humans or a combination thereof. Given the severity of MERS, we find it unlikely that humans could be sufficiently frequently co-infected with two or more different lineages of the virus. Previous serological studies have failed to find evidence of prevalent past MERS-CoV infections of humans (Aburizaiza et al. 2013; Gierer et al. 2013) , although a recent nation-wide study in Saudi Arabia has detected non-negligible numbers of individuals with antibodies against MERS-CoV, especially among shepherds and slaughterhouse workers (M\u00fc ller et al. 2015) . We thus propose that MERS-CoV mostly infects, and recombines, in camels. A study by Adney et al. (2014) has shown that camels only suffer mild symptoms from MERS-CoV infection and numerous other studies indicate an extremely high prevalence of antibodies specific against MERS-CoV in camels (Chu et al. 2014; Corman et al. 2014b; M\u00fc ller et al. 2014; Reusken et al. 2013 Reusken et al. , 2014 . At the same time, however, sequencing has not indicated the presence of multiple infection in camels or any other animal. We believe that individual MERS-CoV coinfections are rare, but given the size of the epidemic in camels, as inferred from serology, the total number of co-infections is high. In addition, MERS-CoV infection is transient in camels (Adney et al. 2014) , and thus sequencing efforts, which have been insufficient and very limited in camels, are highly unlikely to capture a co-infection.",

Synapomorphies are shown as coloured ticks (coloured by coding sequence in which they occur) on branches where they occur. Homoplasies are shown as circles connected with coloured lines, colour corresponds with the coding sequence in which the mutation has occured. Mutations are positioned on the branches in proportion to where the mutation occurs in the genome, e.g. mutations shown towards the end of a branch correspond to mutations near the 3' terminus of the genome.
