            "text": "Griffiths and colleagues, in this Journal, recently highlighted the nature and consequences of microbial coinfections. Their results suggest differences between co-infected patients and those with single infections, with co-infection having serious health effects. 1 The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of viral and atypical bacterial pathogens as single or as co-infections in hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in Paraguay. ARIs with 3.5 million deaths annually, account for 20% of all deaths in pre-school children worldwide, with 90% of these deaths due to pneumonia. Risk factors for severe ARI include malnutrition, low birth weight, passive smoking, no breastfeeding, low socio-economic status, overcrowding, immunodeficiency and HIV infection, and consequently, the greatest morbidity associated with ARIs occurs in the developing world. 2 The most frequently implicated viruses consistently shown to predominate among hospitalized children with ARIs are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (hRV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV1-2-3-4). Other commonly implicated pathogens are influenza A and B viruses (FluA and Flu B), adenovirus (AdV), human coronavirus (hCoV) and enterovirus (EV), and human bocavirus (hBoV). 3e7 The expansion in the number of circulating pathogens, combined with an increased capacity to simultaneously test for multiple organisms through the use of recent advances in molecular detection, 5, 8 has highlighted the potential impact of co-infections, when more than one pathogen from a single sample has been identified.",

The median time of hospitalization in cases with RSV infection was 4.4 days, a 2-fold increase compared to cases with hRV infection (median time 2.2 days). Scientists have questioned whether hRV co-infections lead to more severe clinical syndromes, leading to longer hospitalizations. 10 A better understanding of the full spectrum of bacterial colonization and of the respiratory viruses causing ARIs among hospitalized children in resource-limited tropical countries is essential to improve preventive and therapeutic strategies. It was suggested recently that co-infecting pathogens generally interact to worsen human health. 8 Platforms have not yet been adapted to the needs of clinics at district or local levels, nor have they even been in hospitals of major cities. To date, most surveillance for respiratory Letters to the Editor viruses in control programs are using an indirect immunofluorescence assay, detecting seven common respiratory viruses RSV, FluA and FluB, PIV1-3 and AdV. We describe for the first time in Paraguay the circulation of non-common respiratory viruses either alone or in co-infections with other respiratory viruses such as CoVs, BoV, hMPV and EV. The quantitative detection of multiple agents in nasopharyngeal specimens is an ideal approach to better understand the carriage and its relationship with the pathogen causing disease.",

Bacterial colonization was also detected, that include Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) (68.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (Sau) (23.7%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mpp) (5.3%) and Haemophilus influenzae B (HiB) (3.8%) (Table 1). Influenza A, B and H1N1, parechovirus (PV), and Chlamydia pneumoniae were not detected in these 76 cases.Single viral infections accounted for 59.2% (45/76) of cases. Viral co-infection was detected in 20 patients (26.3%), and viral/bacterial pathogens in 54 (71%). Among viral co-infections, dual infections were identified in 19.7% of cases (15/76), triple infections in 3.9% (3/76), while 4 and 5 viral co-infections were detected in two cases.Bronchiolitis 53/76 (69.7%), EVW/asthma 15/76 (19.7%) and URTI 8/76 (10.5%) comprised the majority of discharge diagnoses. More than two days of hospitalization were required in 53% patients (median time 4.5 days, IQR 1e19). Out of 53 cases with bronchiolitis, 46 (87%) were children under 6 months of age, in whom rhinovirus, CoV OC43 and RSV represented the majority of infections. Up to 70% of children with severe bronchiolitis had at least one bacterium in their NA; and 40 children under 6 months of age (75.5%) carried Streptococcus pneumoniae. Spn detected in NAs were at low cycle-threshold values (under 25) in 50% of cases and these could be considered as an increased risk for bacterial pneumonia.",
