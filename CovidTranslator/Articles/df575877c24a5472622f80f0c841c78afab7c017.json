            "text": "Dysregulation of the innate immune response underlies numerous pathological conditions. The Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) is the prototypical sensor of infection or injury that orchestrates the innate response via sequential activation of both cell-surface and endocytic signaling pathways that trigger distinct downstream consequences. CD14 binds and delivers LPS to TLR4 and has been identified as a positive regulator of TLR4 signal transduction. It is logical that negative regulators of this process also exist to maintain the critical balance required for fighting infection, healing damaged tissue and resolving inflammation. We showed that CD13 negatively modulates receptor-mediated Ag uptake in dendritic cells to control T-cell activation in adaptive immunity. Here we report that myeloid CD13 governs internalization of TLR4 and subsequent innate signaling cascades, activating IRF-3 independently of CD14. CD13 is co-internalized with TLR4, CD14 and dynamin into Rab5 + early endosomes upon LPS treatment. Importantly, in response to TLR4 ligands HMGB1 and LPS, pIRF-3 activation and transcription of its target genes is enhanced in CD13 KO DCs while TLR4 surface signaling remains unaffected, resulting in a skewed inflammatory response. This finding is physiologically relevant as ischemic injury in vivo provoked identical TLR4 responses. Finally, CD13 KO mice showed significantly enhanced IFN\u03b2mediated signal transduction via JAK-STAT, escalating iNOS transcription levels and promoting accumulation of oxidative stress mediators and tissue injury. Mechanistically, inflammatory activation of macrophages upregulates CD13 expression and CD13 and TLR4 coimmunoprecipitate. Therefore, CD13 negatively regulates TLR4 signaling, thereby balancing the innate response by maintaining the inflammatory equilibrium critical to innate immune regulation.",

Importantly, these PRRs also recognize endogenous signals of tissue injury (Dangerassociated Molecular Patterns, DAMPs) released by dead and dying cells and trigger largely identical immune responses to remove dead cells and heal the wound. Members of the prototypical Toll-like Receptor (TLR) family recognize subclasses of bacterial and viral pathogens and include TLR4 that recognizes the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall LPS and a number of endogenous ligands released from injured tissue to activate the immune response. In response to infection, the absence of TLR4 activation results in death due to septicemia, while excessive activation can lead to serious complications of dysregulated inflammation and further tissue damage. Similarly, repair of sterile tissue damage also requires a well-controlled innate immune response in diseases such as myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral artery disease (1) (2) (3) . Therefore, tight control of TLR4 signaling is imperative for a balanced and effective immune response.",

The specific localization of TLR4 to these compartments is critical to the regulation of innate immunity in response to injury and infection, but the mechanisms that oversee receptor passage along various channels are not well understood. TLR4 engagement at the cell-surface triggers the TIRAP-MyD88 mediated pathway to activate p38MAPK and IKK\u03b2-\u03b1-inflammatory cytokine genes (4) (5) (6) . The TLR4-ligand complex is then internalized via a dynamin-dependent process where it initiates signaling from the endosome, eliciting a TRAM-TRIF-dependent response to promote transcription of type I IFNs via the interferon regulatory factor, IRF3 (4, 5) . Recent studies have shown that aberrant signaling from either of these pathways result in both pro-and anti-healing effects in inflammatory disease models (7, 8) .",

            "text": "The CD13/Aminopeptidase N membrane metallopeptidase is highly expressed on myeloid cells and activated endothelial cells and participates in various innate and adaptive immune mechanisms (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Recently we found that CD13 negatively regulates receptor-mediated, dynamin-dependent antigen uptake by DCs to control the adaptive immune response (9) . While DC development, maturation, antigen processing and presentation were normal in CD13 KO mice, lack of CD13 significantly enhanced cytotoxic T cell activation due to increased antigen internalization. Because the TLR4 endocytic signaling pathway requires TLR4 internalization in endosomes, we hypothesized that CD13 may also regulate this essential immune bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. In the current investigation we explored the role of CD13 in regulation of TLR4 signal transduction pathways. Our results demonstrate that CD13 regulates the balance between pro-inflammatory and type I IFN-generating signal transduction in myeloid cells, thus identifying myeloid CD13 as a functional regulator of innate immunity. These observations increase our understanding of the immune response to injury and infection, information essential to deciphering the pathways and endogenous mediators regulating ligand-induced receptor transport. This knowledge is fundamental to understanding the capabilities and limitations of innate immune detection systems involving TLR-mediated signal transduction pathways and to the design of strategies to promote healing by manipulating novel regulatory molecules.",

In innate immunity, TLR4 endosomal signaling is critical to maintain the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory responses to tissue injury and infection (4) . Based on our previous findings that CD13 regulates dynamindependent, mannose receptor-mediated antigen uptake in DCs to shape the adaptive immune response (9), we hypothesized that CD13 may mediate innate immunity as well by controlling ligand-induced TLR4 endocytosis. While TLR4 surface expression was equivalent in unstimulated wild type and CD13 KO splenic DCs by flow cytometric and immunofluorescence analysis ( Fig. 1A -C) and Supplemental Fig. S1B , loss of TLR4 surface expression was higher over time in CD13 KO compared to wild type DCs upon treatment with the TLR4 ligand LPS (Fig. 1B, C) . Similarly, flow cytometric analysis illustrated that BMDCs or CD8 + splenic DCs from CD13 KO mice were significantly more efficient in the internalization of labeled LPS over a range of doses shown to induce TLR4 endocytosis (6) (0.05-1\u03bcg/ml, Fig. 1D and data not shown) suggesting that endocytic internalization of TLR4 and its ligand LPS is increased in the absence of CD13. Importantly, pretreatment of cells with 100\u03bcg/ml bestatin, an inhibitor of CD13 peptidase activity showed no significant effect on LPS-induced TLR4 endocytosis or uptake of LPS-FITC in either genotype (Fig.  1B, D) , suggesting that CD13 regulation of TLR4 internalization is independent of its peptidase function.",

To determine if CD13 undergoes a similar fate following LPS ligation, we treated wild type macrophages with LPS and assessed CD13 localization by immunofluorescence using antibodies to TLR4 and markers of the various endosomal compartments. In contrast to vehicle treatment (Fig. 1Ea) , LPS stimulation indeed led to internalization of CD13 in TLR4 + and dynamin + vesicles (Fig. 1Eb) . Furthermore, similar to TLR4, CD13 was found in Rab5 + early endosomes [ Fig. 1Ec , and ref. (4)]. Importantly, pulse-chase experiments with anti-TLR4 or anti-CD13 antibodies demonstrated that surface-labeled TLR4 or CD13 trafficked to Rab11 + recycling endosomes, peaking at 30 minutes following LPS treatment (Fig. 1Ed) , suggesting that CD13 may participate in receptor recycling as well. Collectively, this data is consistent with our hypothesis that CD13 regulates TLR4 endocytosis and suggesting that CD13 may also impact TLR4 endosomal signal transduction pathways. Quantification of images by MetaMorph software indicated that compared to vehicle treatment (r=0.3), a strong positive correlation (r=0.5-0.7) between proteins upon LPS stimulation was observed as determined by Pearson's analysis (Fig. 1F) . Furthermore, microscopic images indicate that the majority of CD13 + or TLR4 + vesicles are also Rab5 + or Rab11a + while Rab5 + or Rab11a + vesicles do not always contain CD13 or TLR4, probably indicating that the system is not saturated.",

Since LPS uptake is increased in the absence of CD13, we predicted that the alternate TRIF-dependent endosomal signaling would be preferentially induced in CD13 KO myeloid cells. Immunoblot analysis of lysates from wild type and CD13 KO macrophages ( Fig. 2A, C) or DCs (Fig. 2B , D) demonstrated that lack of CD13 in either cell type resulted in a significant activation of the alternate pathway-specific transcription factor, IRF3 in response to LPS in a time dependent manner. Pretreatment of LPS-stimulated DCs with Dynasore, a small molecule inhibitor of the scission GTPase dynamin (17) , abrogated the increase suggesting that CD13 plays a role at the level of dynamin-dependent endocytosis (Fig. 2B,  D) . Alternatively, pretreatment of wild type macrophages with the CD13 blocking mAb SL13 prior to LPS induction recapitulated the increased IRF3 activation seen in CD13 KO cells, further implicating CD13 in the endocytic process (Fig. 2E) . Finally, the rise in IRF3 phosphorylation correlates with functional hyperactivation in CD13 KO DCs as evidenced by increases in mRNA levels of the pIRF3 target genes IFN\u03b2 and IP-10 in response to LPS [Fig. 2F , G and refs (18, 19) ]. In addition to pathogenic ligands such as LPS, TLR4 also responds to molecules released by dead and dying cells, DAMPs. The predominant TLR4binding DAMP is the nuclear protein HMGB1, which is secreted by inflammatory macrophages and monocytes (20) . Importantly, CD13 KO cells treated with purified, endotoxin-free HMGB1 protein also showed significantly increased levels of IRF3 targets IFN\u03b2 and IP-10 (Figs. 2F and G, respectively), which was abolished by pretreatment with Dynasore (Fig. 2G) . Collectively, these results indicate that CD13 modulates the uptake of TLR4 and its ligands LPS and HMGB1 in a dynamin-dependent manner, thereby controlling the innate immune response to pathogenic or danger-associated antigens.",

To address this issue, we analyzed p-p38/ MAPK levels in wild type and CD13 KO BMDMs and found that levels of activated ERK, p38 and Akt were equivalent in response to LPS over time regardless of genotype ( Fig. 3A-D) . As expected, the increase in phosphorylated-p38 was not sensitive to Dynasore, further confirming that TLR4 signaling from the cell surface is independent of dynamin and is not mediated by CD13 (Fig. 3C) . However, Akt phosphorylation was blocked by Dynasore treatment (Fig. 3D) , consistent with the late phase activation of Akt via dynamin-dependent endosomal signaling described in previous studies (4, 5) . Indeed, phosphorylation of the upstream mediator of NF-\u03baB/MAPK signaling, pIRAK4, was comparable between genotypes ( Figure 3E ) in agreement with pERK and pp38 levels and supporting late-phase Akt activation (4, 5) . Finally, quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated a time dependent increase in the mRNA levels of downstream targets IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IKK\u03b2-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in response to either LPS or HMGB1 in cells from either genotype (Figs. 3F and S1A). In contrast to endosomal targets, there was no significant difference in the levels of NF\u03baB/ MAPK downstream target genes between wild type and CD13 KO BMDM at time points prior to 40 minutes. However, later time points (60 min) showed a modest but not significant increase in these targets in CD13 KO cells, again suggesting late-phase endosomal NF-\u03baB/ MAPK activation as has been reported (4, 5) . Finally, Dynasore pretreatment had no effect on NF-kB target gene levels, further confirming that TLR4 surface signaling is dynamin independent (Supplemental Fig S1A) .

However, healing of damaged tissue and muscle regeneration was unambiguously impaired in these mice despite the favorable inflammatory environment. We hypothesized that the CD13 regulation of the TLR4 response to endogenous DAMPs, in ischemic tissues might contribute to compromised repair.

Ligation of the type I-IFN\u03b1\u03b2 receptor, IFNAR, induces the JAK/STAT pathway to initiate production of the enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS, and ref (23)]. iNOS metabolizes L-arginine to produce nitric oxide (NO), which is a key component in microbial defense but is toxic when present at high levels (23, 24) . A CD13-dependent overexpression of iNOS may lead to increased levels of NO and its reactive metabolites, which would be deleterious to the surrounding tissue. Indeed, CD13 KO mice exhibited significantly higher levels of the NO metabolite nitrite in both serum and muscle extracts when compared to the wild type mice (Fig. 4C-D) supporting a scenario where a CD13-dependent increase in IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN\u03b2 levels prompts autocrine activation of IFNAR and increased iNOS, exaggerated production of nitrite and other injurious reactive oxygen species in response to ischemic injury. Finally, to confirm that these observations were due to increased uptake of antigens from dying cells, wild type and CD13 KO DCs were incubated with irradiated wild type splenocytes labeled with OVA-FITC and uptake of cell-associated fluorescence by DCs was analyzed (25) . Similar to the response to LPS, internalized cellassociated fluorescence was significantly higher in cells lacking CD13 (Fig. 4E) , confirming that CD13 mediates internalization of dead cell antigens to impact the TLR4 response to sterile injury in vivo.",

Cells lacking CD13 produced increased levels of nitrite in a time dependent manner with a concomitant increase in iNOS transcripts in CD13 KO cell lysates when compared to its wild type counterpart (Fig. 5A, B) , consistent with our in vivo results. To confirm that increased iNOS levels were mediated by IFNAR, we pretreated the cells with the synthetic protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG490 to specifically inhibit JAK2-dependent signal transduction triggered downstream of IFNAR activation. Both nitrite concentrations and iNOS transcript levels were significantly and equivalently diminished by pretreatment with 25\u03bcM AG490 in both wild type and CD13 KO cells [ (Fig. 5A , B and ref (26) ]. Importantly, activation of NF\u03baB MyD88-dependent signaling initiated from the cell surface also leads to production of iNOS. We measured the levels of the active subunit of NF\u03baB, p65 and its downstream target IL-6 under similar conditions and determined that while LPS stimulation led to a two-fold increase in IL-6 transcript and p65 protein level in both genotypes, blocking JAK2 activity had no effect on levels of p65-NF\u03baB or its downstream target IL-6 ( Fig. 5C-E) . Therefore, the increase in iNOS and nitrite in CD13 KO cells and tissues is due to CD13 regulation of the p-IRF3 signaling pathway leading to increased autocrine, IFN\u03b2-induced JAK/STAT signal transduction and likely contributes to the impaired healing we observe in CD13 KO animals (13) .",

Since we have demonstrated that CD13 negatively regulates TLR4 endocytosis, it is possible that CD13 and CD14 act in concert to regulate the TLR4 response to infection and injury. Therefore, we investigated their possible association in LPS-stimulated receptor internalization. Similar to TLR4, surface CD14 expression is comparable in unstimulated wild type and CD13 KO splenic DCs (Figs. 6A and 1A) . However, in contrast to the differential endocytosis of TLR4, CD14 internalization was modest with no difference in cells of either genotype upon LPS induction and is not sensitive to Bestatin (Figs. 6B, C and 1B, C). Analogously, CD13 and CD14 are not consistently co-localized in endosomes in response to LPS as demonstrated by a weak Pearson's coefficient (r=0.33) (Fig. 6D, E) . Taken together these results suggest that regulation of TLR4 internalization by CD13 is independent of CD14, and perhaps more importantly, that CD13 may not regulate endocytosis per se, but rather which proteins are internalized.",

In agreement with this finding, we found that LPS stimulation of WT macrophages induced CD13 protein expression over four-fold in a time dependent manner (Fig. 7A) , suggesting that maintaining a high level of CD13 expression is advantageous during inflammation. Additionally, our study characterizing CD13 in the regulation of antigen uptake demonstrated that while the lack of CD13 enhanced mannose receptor (MR) endocytosis, CD13 and MR did not occupy the same complex (9) . Surprisingly and in contrast to MR, immunoblot analysis of macrophage and dendritic cell lysates immunoprecipitated with CD13 mAb demonstrated that TLR4 was indeed present in the CD13 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 7B) , suggesting they are components of the same protein complex and perhaps that CD13 regulates internalization by different, receptor-dependent mechanisms.",

            "text": "We have recently shown that CD13 negatively regulates dynamin-dependent endocytosis of distinct ligand-receptor pairs in dendritic cells (9) . Here we extend these observations to demonstrate that CD13 maintains the prototypical pattern recognition receptor TLR4 at the dendritic cell surface, thus holding endocytic signal transduction in check and avoiding deleterious tissue destruction. We find that in resting dendritic cells and macrophages CD13 and TLR4 associate in a protein complex and that LPS induces CD13 internalization and colocalization with TLR4 in dynamin + and Rab5 + early endosomes in vitro. In the absence of CD13, TLR4 signal transduction is skewed toward the endocytic TRIF-biased pathway, inducing hyperactivation of IRF3 and its target cytokine, IFN\u03b2 and autocrine production of iNOS, thus indicating an unequivocal role for CD13 in the regulation of the innate immune response to LPS (Fig. 7C) . We had previously shown that tissue repair and healing were impaired in CD13 KO animals in response to ischemic injury in vivo (13) and asked if altered TLR4 signal transduction in response to release of endogenous DAMPs may contribute to the tissue destruction we observed in vivo. Indeed, assay of ischemic skeletal muscle from CD13 KO animals showed exaggerated levels of IFN\u03b2. While physiologic levels of IFN\u03b2 normally induce pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory cytokines, uncontrolled IFN\u03b2 production can lead to autocrine activation of its receptor IFNAR and subsequent JAK/ STAT signaling cascade, ultimately resulting in pro-inflammatory iNOS and toxic reactive oxygen species (Fig. 7C , (23, 24, 28) . Indeed serum and muscle extracts from CD13 KO mice exhibited increased levels of the NO metabolite nitrite (28) . Thus, we have identified a novel function for CD13 in maintaining the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the innate immune response to PAMPs and DAMPs.",

Further studies have identified other associated molecules that regulate either cell surface or endocytic TLR4 signaling such as mediation of LPS binding to CD14 by CD33 (30), delivery of LPS to TLR4 by CD14 (6), Syk phosphorylation of TLR4 (31), enrichment of TIRAP at the plasma membrane by CD11b to regulate the MyD88-dependent pathway (32) as well as TRIF-mediated signal transduction from endosomes (33) and others whose functions are unknown (34) . We find that loss of CD13 has a similar phenotype in response to both PAMPs and DAMPs, but no influence on LPS-induced pro-inflammatory MyD88 signaling; arguing that CD13's control of TLR4 signaling is independent of ligand availability and is primarily at the level of endocytosis.",

            "text": "Endocytosis is an extremely complex process that regulates the internalization of a vast array of cargo molecules which are identified, organized and assembled by adaptor proteins into a single endocytic compartment [reviewed in refs (15, 35) ]. These accessory molecules range in their specificity for a particular cargo(es) and have different sub-cellular/tissue locations and importantly, operate in a modular fashion such that adding or subtracting adaptors to a complex can specifically modify the uptake of receptors or their ligands. Thus adaptors can control the composition of proteins in the endosome without interfering with vesicle formation. We have demonstrated that in addition to TLR4, the internalization of a number of receptors via mechanisms requiring the fission GTPase dynamin is CD13dependent (9, 36) . A potential mechanistic insight to CD13's function in endocytosis may be provided by the fact that dynamin-dependent endocytosis primarily initiates in lipid rafts (37, 38) and that CD13 localizes in lipid rafts in monocytes (39) and endothelial cells (36) . We have shown that CD13 regulates plasma membrane organization by determining the composition of proteins included in lipid rafts (36) , suggesting it may act as an endocytic adaptor protein. While the CD13 cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains do not contain the motifs identified as adaptor 'sorting signals' (40), we have found that CD13 is present in a physical complex with one of the receptors it regulates but not another (9) . It is possible that depending on the target, CD13 can act as either a direct adaptor or in an indirect manner (perhaps with other adaptors) to internalize target receptors. We are currently dissecting these possibilities by molecular mapping and mutation of the CD13/TLR4 interacting domains to determine if disrupting the interaction impacts endocytosis of TLR4 or MR as well as identifying other additional CD13-interacting proteins by proteomic analysis. Additionally, we and others (41) find that CD13 expression levels are remarkably upregulated by inflammatory activation signals and tissue damage, supporting the notion that a high level of CD13 expression is important during the immune response. Understanding the contribution of these and other CD13-mediated mechanisms to endocytosis is the subject of active investigation in our laboratory.",

However in untreated cells CD13 and CD14 do not extensively co-localize on the membrane, particularly when compared to CD13 and TLR4. Similarly, although CD13 and CD14 appear to occupy the same endosomal compartments in response to LPS treatment, the majority of the CD14 remains autonomous while TLR4 and CD13 are nearly completely colocalized in intracellular vesicles. Furthermore, the loss of CD13 has no effect on LPSinduced CD14 uptake, suggesting these are separate processes. Alternatively, it has been proposed that in response to DAMPs CD14 guides TLR4 into lipid rafts to promote downstream signaling (42) , raising the possibility that CD13 and CD14 may not regulate endocytic processes, but rather act as opposing adaptors that mediate which proteins are available at the endosomal 'loading station'.",

In each of these cases, downstream signal transduction cascades are altered, illustrating endocytic control over signal transduction. As an extracellular peptidase, CD13 cleaves single amino acid residues from small peptides and therefore its substrates vary depending on the tissue where it is expressed. However, our observations have clearly shown that CD13 is a surprisingly multifunctional molecule that often acts independently of its enzymatic activity to regulate diverse processes such as angiogenesis, inflammatory trafficking, antigen presentation, cellcell adhesion, coronavirus infection and maintenance of the stem cell niche (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . While it is difficult to reconcile how a single molecule can regulate such apparently disparate functions, the fact that CD13 participates in the endocytosis of various receptors may underlie its wide range of activities. This finding emphasizes that endocytosis is far more complex than a mechanism to transport molecules across a membrane; it is responsible for the organization and communication of all eukaryotic cells and is intimately linked to essentially every aspect of cellular regulation including receptor availability, signal transduction, adhesion, migration, membrane integrity and cell polarity (15) . When viewed in this context, CD13 and other endocytic regulators become critical biological monitors.",

Surface TLR4 signals via MyD88 to activate Nf\u03baB and proinflammatory cytokines and is independent of CD13 expression. TLR4-CD13 then undergoes endocytosis in a dynamin and CD14 dependent manner resulting in IRF3 activation and upregulation of its target genes, type I IFNs. In response to LPS, CD13 modulates TLR4 receptor-mediated endocytosis where lack of CD13 skews cytokine production towards IRF3 target, IFN\u03b2, ultimately leading to toxic iNOS and ROS production via activation of IFNAR and JAK/ STAT signaling.",
