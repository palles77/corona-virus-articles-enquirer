Exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens occurs frequently in the life of an individual animal and can spread laterally throughout large populations at a rapid rate. Depending on the level of immunity within the population and the degree of management under which the animals are raised, the effect can be quite severe, particularly if concurrent infection of multiple pathogens should occur. The need to prevent the introduction of and to mitigate the effects of such pathogens has resulted in the evolution of disease-control strategies and biosecurity programs. It is a misconception that only large production units can afford to take advantage of advanced principles of disease control. The practice of biosecurity and the application of disease detection techniques are important to all producers.",

A similar process should be evaluated from the individual perspective of each cattle operation, considering the most important hazards to sustainable profitability of the enterprise. Primary pathogens of concern may differ from herd to herd, depending on factors such as sale of breeding stock. For many dairy cattle producers, the adult cow gastrointestinal pathogens of highest concern include Mycobacterium paratuberculosis (M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, the cause of Johne's disease) and Salmonella spp. These pathogens therefore form the basis for much of the biosecurity discussion that follows.",

Animal movements from farm to farm, especially herd expansions, create special pathogen risks owing to increased exposures of cattle to multiple pathogens at times of reduced immune function related to stresses of transportation and animal re-sorting. Also, dairy cattle in the United States have become more genetically homogeneous [10] , leading to risks of lack of hybrid vigor and associated lack of resistance to diseases to which these cattle are exposed. The authors begin by evaluating the disease effect, epidemiology (reservoirs of infection, primary methods of transmission), and primary control measures of these two cattle diseases. More complete understanding of the epidemiology of disease can lead to the development and implementation of more effective control strategies through the interruption of transmission between and within farms.",

Cattle serve as a primary reservoir of infection for M. paratuberculosis, the pathogen causing Johne's disease, along with other ruminant species and potentially, other animals. M. paratuberculosis is an intracellular bacterium that survives well but does not replicate outside infected animals for extended periods [5] . Transmission to uninfected cattle occurs primarily through fecal-oral routes and also through consumption of contaminated or infected milk, colostrum, or water [22] . Young calves are at highest risk of becoming infected. A long incubation period of 3 to 6 years precedes development of clinical signs. Factors predisposing to transmission of Johne's disease include introduction of cattle to the herd and use of management practices that expose young replacement heifers to the pathogen (use of multiple-cow maternity areas, lack of segregation of calves from dams after birth, and feeding of contaminated colostrum and milk to calves) [8, 27] . Because of the epidemiology of Johne's disease (highest susceptibility of youngest cattle and long incubation period before clinical disease), reduction of exposure of youngstock to the pathogen is of primary importance in dairy herd control programs.",

Recently, concern has arisen from the public health community about the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Salmonella spp. One of these strains (Salmonella Typhimurium DT104) was recognized in the 1990s in the United States and elsewhere as characteristically resistant to five different antimicrobics and associated with disease outbreaks in humans and cattle [1] . Salmonellosis is caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica, with more than 2200 serotypes identified. The reservoir of infection includes all species of animals and birds [17] . These pathogens also can replicate in the environment under certain temperature and moisture conditions out of direct sunlight and can survive for several months [14, 18] . Transmission occurs primarily through fecal-oral routes, often through contaminated feed, water, or the environment. The epidemiology of Salmonella spp. transmission can be complex, however, with transmission cycling though multiple species of animals in a geographic area, as demonstrated by Kinde et al. [12] . Risk factors for dairy cattle include introduction of infected cattle, grouping and housing of cattle, contaminated feed and water, and transfer of the pathogen by movement of vehicles, people, rodents, birds, and other animals [18, 25] . Control of Salmonella spp. transmission is especially challenging because the organism can persist in cattle environments [7] .",

Isolation of incoming cattle before introduction to the herd is not an effective control measure for diseases of long incubation like Johne's disease, but it can be effective for diseases with shorter incubation periods, including salmonellosis. Although many cattle producers identify animals for herd management purposes, no universal animal identification exists to track the movement of cattle from farm to farm. Such systems have been adopted in Canada and parts of Europe, and tracking movements could facilitate control of certain diseases.",

For Johne's disease and salmonellosis, the first level of monitoring is the recording of clinical cases of disease. Most cows with clinical Johne's disease (diarrhea and weight loss not responsive to treatment) are culled from the herd, so a record of clinical Johne's disease as a contributing cause for culling is an efficient way to measure the incidence of Johne's disease in the herd through time.

Lack of confirmed infection with M. paratuberculosis leads biosecurity planning in a different direction (focus on prevention of infection) compared with that for herds with confirmed infection (focus on control of infection). Periodic reassessment is important to compare seroprevalence to the baseline prevalence. It is equally important for periodic evaluation of the management plan and its implementation (e.g., annual risk assessment) by an outside reviewer.

The use of segregated production, as with offsite heifer rearing or the use of custom heifer growers to raise replacement animals, is considered important in reducing the risk of exposure and infection of young calves to important pathogens in adult feces. Important pathogens include not only M. paratuberculosis and Salmonella spp. but also others that cause enteric disease in young calves (e.g., Escherichia coli, cryptosporidia, coccidia, rotavirus, and coronavirus; see chapter 2 by Barrington et al.). Because the newborn and young calf are considered to be the most susceptible to infection with M. paratuberculosis, early removal from the dam and either segregated or off-site rearing are considered to be important management techniques to reduce the risk for new infection [9, 19] . If replacement cattle are raised on the same site, the location of calf hutches, barns, and pastures should be physically isolated from facilities and pastures used for the adult livestock. Manure and feed should be handled in such a way as to prevent youngstock from being exposed to fecal material from older animals, which requires consideration of the manure handling system, the direction of manure flow or drainage, and the equipment used to move feed and manure around the farm. For example, adult manure should not be pushed through or stored in areas (e.g., barnyards) where youngstock have access. Also, manure-or feed-handling equipment contaminated with adult manure should not be allowed to come in contact with youngstock facilities.",

Buyers also should learn about udder health (i.e., somatic cell count data, bulk tank culture results, clinical mastitis records and culture results, examination and palpation of udders and teat ends), other clinical disease records (e.g., diagnosis of salmonellosis or clinical Johne's disease), and the biosecurity, vaccination, and testing program for the herd of origin. Prospective buyers should avoid purchasing replacement animals from unknown sources or those that have been mixed with other cattle before sale. If possible, producers should purchase heifers rather than mature cows because they are easier to quarantine if not yet milking, and because they are less likely to have contagious mastitis infection. For Johne's disease, there is large benefit to selection of cattle from herds enrolled in a status program (Voluntary Johne's Disease Herd Status Program, to be discussed in more detail in the next section).",

Although there is no universal consensus on which diseases to test for, those worth considering and that veterinarians should at least discuss with their clientele include bovine viral diarrhea virus (persistent infection), contagious mastitis (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma bovis), Neospora caninum, bovine leukosis virus, Salmonella spp., and M. paratuberculosis.

Because of the biology of this disease and the imperfect diagnostic tests currently available, ELISA tests only detect approximately 15% of 24-month old-heifers that are infected with M. paratuberculosis but still in the early stages of the disease [23] . Under these circumstances, testing individual heifers will not prevent the introduction of Johne's disease; however, by use of herd screening programs, the infection status of the herd of origin can be determined far more accurately than the infection status of a single individual animal. Producers can dramatically lower the risk of introducing a Johne's disease-infected animal by purchasing animals from herds that have screened the herd and are known to be either negative or have a low disease prevalence. Many states have developed herd status programs to document herd infection status (e.g., Voluntary Johne's Disease Herd Status Program for Cattle).",

Purchasing these feeds fresh, on a frequent basis, and mixing feed immediately before feeding may reduce the risk of using contaminated feed. One should rotate stocks, always feeding the oldest feed out first. A new load of feed should not be dumped on top of the remains of the last load. Feed storage bins, silos, commodity sheds, and other feed storage areas should be cleaned out between batches of feed by pressure washing to remove old feed, dust, bird manure and other contaminants, and then allowing ample time to dry before refilling.

            "text": "Moore [15] has written a comprehensive review on the biosecurity of swine units, and readers should refer to it for additonal detail. To minimize disease transmission, breeding should be done by artificial insemination (AI). Semen should be purchased from a reputable AI center with a documented high-quality health status monitored on a monthly basis. Semen should be distributed by a courier service to neutral delivery points located at the perimeter of the farm. Other biosecurity measures include a minimum of 48 hours free of swine contact and shower facilities for all personnel before entry into the sow and boar centers. Fumigation rooms are an excellent way to disinfect inanimate objects, such as tools and feed bags, before their entry into the animal airspace. For personnel movement between onsite facilities, personnel should change boots and coveralls and wash their hands before entering each facility. Professional exterminators should be hired on a contract basis to visit farms monthly. All openings to facilities should be bird-proofed, using bird screen, particularly over the sidewall openings to naturally ventilated finishing facilities. Other important components of a sound biosecurity program include incineration of carcasses, washing and disinfecting transport vehicles when marketing animals, and perimeter fencing.",
