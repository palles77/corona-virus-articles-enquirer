In general, given a context, some attributes may not be essential in three-way concept analysis, such as forming three-way concept lattice. So in this paper, we study the attribute reductions of three-way concept lattices in order to make the data easily be understood. Firstly, based on different criteria generated from object-induced three-way concept (OEconcept), four kinds of attribute reductions are proposed. The four reductions together embody different characteristics of a formal context and can be used in different occasions. Secondly, we discuss their relationships, including their advantages and disadvantages and the relationships among consistent sets and among the cores. Thirdly, based on attribute-induced three-way concept (AE-concept), we also give four attribute-induced three-way attribute reductions and discuss their relationships. Finally, the approaches to computing these attribute reductions are presented and the obtained results are demonstrated and verified by an empirical case. In this paper, we systematically investigate the attribute reductions of threeway concept lattices which enriches the study of formal concept analysis.",

One can construct rules of acceptance from positive region, rules of rejection from negative region and rules of non-commitment from boundary region.",

            "text": "However, in FCA we can only get the two-way decision rather than the three-way decision. That is, based on a formal concept, one can only determine whether an object (attribute) certainly possesses (is shared by) all elements in the intent (extent) and such decision is called inclusion method. Actually, the formal context also offers us the information about whether an object (attribute) does not possesses (is not shared by) any attribute (object), which is called exclusion method, but this cannot be reflected in the formal concept. Since this kind of exclusion method is commonly used in our daily life, Qi et al. [23] applied 3WD to FCA and proposed three-way concept analysis (3WCA). Two key components in 3WCA are three-way concepts and three-way concept lattices. Similar with the formal concept in FCA, a three-way concept is also determined by two parts named extent and intent. However, the extent or intent of a three-way concept should be an orthopair studied by Ciucci [24] . That is to say, in 3WCA, \"the extent (or the intent) of a three way concept is equipped with two parts: positive one and negative one. These two parts are used to express the semantics 'jointly possessed' and 'jointly not possessed' in a formal context.\" [25] This newly proposed three-way concept combines inclusion method (positive region) with exclusion method (negative region). Thus based on a three-way concept, one can divide the object (attribute) universe into three regions to make threeway decision.",

It is also an interesting topic in FCA. Many significant results in attribute reduction have been obtained based on a formal context. For example, Zhang et al. [36] discussed the lattice reduction theory where the notion of \"reducing the context\" in [15] was developed. Within such framework, Zhang et al. [36] constructed judgment theorems of consistent sets, and developed approaches to attribute reduction based on discernibility matrix, which was given a further simplification by Qi [37] from the viewpoint of parent-child concepts. Based on the lattice reduction theory of formal contexts, Wei et al. [38] also studied the reduction theory of formal decision contexts under two different meanings of consistency. And Li et al. [39] have proposed the attribute reduction in order to preserve the rules in the formal decision context. On the other hand, Wang and Ma [40] proposed another attribute reduction in order to preserve the extents of meet-irreducible elements in the original formal concept lattice. Based on the irreducible elements, Li et al. [41] defined the join-irreducible attribute reduction in order to preserve the extents of join-irreducible elements in the original formal concept lattice. From the viewpoint of granular computing, granular reduction was proposed by Wu et al. [42] Additionally, Liu et al. [43] have studied the attribute reduction of object oriented formal concept lattices and property oriented formal concept lattices, and furthermore Wang et al. [44] discussed relations of attribute reductions between object and property oriented formal concept lattices.",

            "text": "Because of the extensive usages of 3WD and FCA, 3WCA will become a very useful tool for knowledge discovery and data analysis. In order to make the discovery and representation of implicit knowledge in three-way concept lattices easier and simpler, based on the different criteria generated from three-way concepts, we firstly propose different attribute reductions. Since the generalization and the specialization of the knowledge contained in the context are all reflected in the three-way concept lattices, if our reduction can preserve the lattice structure, then the basic knowledge reflected in the three-way concept lattices is preserved. Also, because every three-way concept is the join (meet) of join (meet)-irreducible elements, if our reduction can preserve the irreducible elements, we actually preserve the basic elements in lattice construction. Thus this kind of reduction is very important in lattice construction. From the perspective of granular computation, a three-way object or attribute concept can be regarded as a kind of granule, so a kind of attribute reduction which can preserve the extents of the three-way object (attribute) concepts is proposed. All these attribute reductions together embody different characteristics of a context. The basic ideas of these attribute reductions are similar with the classical attribute reductions mentioned in the previous paragraph. However, different from the attribute reductions in FCA, all the reductions in this paper depend on the three-way concept and the three-way concept can reflect more information than the classical formal concept, so the results and meaning of these attribute reductions in 3WCA are different with the classical ones in FCA. Then, we analyze the relationships among these three-way reductions. Finally, we give some approaches to these attribute reductions. Since the study we make is based on the three-way concept analysis, our work can be regarded as a three-way extension of the attribute reductions mentioned in previous paragraph. This paper mainly discusses the different attribute reductions of three-way concept lattices and the relationships among them. The content is organized as follows. In Section 2 , the basic knowledge of classical and three-way concept analysis is reviewed. Section 3 gives the definitions of four different OE-attribute reductions and discusses their relationships, including the relationships among the corresponding consistent sets and cores. Analogously, in Section 4 , we define four different AE-attribute reductions and discuss the relationships among them. Then, the approaches to computing these attribute reductions are presented in Section 5 . Finally, an empirical case is shown in Section 6 and this paper is concluded with a summary in Section 7 .",

            "text": "The three-way concept lattices are the core structures in 3WCA, because the hierarchical knowledge of three-way concepts is all reflected in these three-way concept lattices. Thus based on the OEconcept lattice, we propose the OE-lattice reduction of ( G, M, I ). From [15] , we know that in a finite lattice, the set of meet-irreducible elements is infimum-dense and the set of joinirreducible elements is supremum-dense. So the meet-irreducible elements and join-irreducible elements are important in the structure of the lattice. Thus from this point of view, we define the object-induced three-way irreducible elements preserving reductions as follows. Analogous to the classical formal concept, every OE-concept can be represented by the join of OE-object concepts. Hence, every OEobject concept can be regarded as an information granule. Thus from the viewpoint of granular computing, object-induced threeway granular (OE-granular) reduction is proposed. The four different object-induced three-way attribute reductions embody different characteristics of a formal context. The OElattice reduction preserves the OE-lattice of the context. Since the OE-lattice can reflect the hierarchical knowledge of the context, the OE-lattice reduction can preserve this kind of hierarchical knowledge of the context. But it needs to consider all the OE-concepts, which let OE-lattice reduction more difficult to be computed. The OE-MIE (JIE)-preserving reduction is to preserve the extents of the meet (join)-irreducible elements of the OE-concept lattice. Because every OE-concept is meet (join) of meet (join)-irreducible elements of the OE-lattice, the meet (join)-irreducible elements are the basic elements of lattice construction. Thus, although the OE-MIE (JIE)-preserving reduction cannot preserve all the hierarchical knowledge of the context, it still plays an important role in lattice construction. Also since OE-MIE (JIE)-preserving reduction only considers the irreducible elements, the results are easy to be computed. The OE-granular reduction is to preserve the extent of the OE-object concept which can be regarded as a kind of information granule from the perspective of granular computing. Thus OE-granular reduction is meaningful in granular computing. Since it only considers OE-object concepts, compared with other OE-reductions, the computation is the simplest. From Definition 7 to 10 , we find that these different attribute reductions consider different perspectives or different information of the context and they can be used in different occasions. If we want to preserve all the knowledge of the context, we need to use OE-lattice reduction; if we want to preserve the basic elements of lattice construction, we need to use OE-MIE (JIE)-preserving reduction; if we want to preserve the information granules, we need to use OE-granular reduction. The above discussions are about the differences of these four OE-reductions which are summarized in Table 1 . Now, let us discuss the relationships among these four OE-attribute reductions. In order to analyze the relationship between OE-granular reduction and OE-JIE-preserving reduction, we firstly discuss the relationship between OE-object concept and the join-irreducible element of OEL ( G, M, I ) in the following proposition. ( X , ( A, B ) ) is an OE-object concept.",

For example, the formal concept (14, ce ) only tells us that patients 1 and 4 belong to one class because they have same symptoms Headache and Diarrhea , but the OE-concept (14, ( ce, bd )) tells us that patients 1 and 4 belong to one class not only because they have the symptoms Headache and Diarrhea but also because they don't have the symptoms Cough and Difficulty Breathing .

Then we investigated the relationships among these newly proposed attribute reductions, the relationships among their consistent sets, as well as the relationships among their cores. Also, we have presented the approaches to computing most of these reductions. Finally, an empirical case is shown to illustrate our analysis. Since three-way concept analysis can be regarded as an extension of formal concept analysis and the three-way concept lattice can reflect more knowledge than the classical one, the study of the three-way concept lattice is a newly proposed but meaningful part of formal concept analysis. Also because the attribute reductions of three-way con-cept lattices are necessary in three-way concept analysis, the attribute reductions we discussed in this paper enrich the study of formal concept analysis.",

Also, since the three-way concept analysis can be regarded as a generalization of the classical formal concept analysis, there must exist some relationships between these two theories. Hence, the relationship among the attribute reductions on these two theories should be studied in the future. Actually, for any kind of attribute reduction mentioned in this paper, the attributes can be classified into three types according to their roles in the reduction [36] . Let ( G, M, I ) be a formal context. For a certain kind of reduction, suppose the set { D i | D i is a reduct, i \u2208 \u03c4 }( \u03c4 is an index set) includes all associated reducts of ( G, M, I ). Then attributes in M can be classified into three types: absolutely necessary attribute, also called core attribute (attribute in \u2229 i \u2208 \u03c4 D i ), relatively necessary attribute (attribute in \u222a i \u2208 \u03c4 D i \u2212 \u2229 i \u2208 \u03c4 D i ), and absolutely unnecessary attribute (attribute in M \u2212 \u222a i \u2208 \u03c4 D i ). Of course, different attributes play different roles in different reductions. For further research, it is of significance to investigate their relationships based on different reductions. Also, in order to apply the theories we discussed in this paper in the real world, in the future, we will propose the corresponding algorithms of these eight different attribute reductions, which may help us to deal with the big data problems in our daily lives more conveniently. And the utility value will also be introduced and added to every concept and the new attribute reductions based on the utility value will be studied, which will make our study more suitable in practices.",

If D \u2208 CS ( OEL ), then Ext OEL (G, M, I) = Ext OEL (G, D, I D ) holds by Definition 7 . For any X \u2208 Ext OEM ( G, M, I ), from the definition of meet-irreducible element, we can get X = Y \u2229 Z ( \u2200 Y, Z \u2208 Ext OEL ( G, M, I ) and Y = X, Z = X ). And because of Ext OEL (G, M, I) = Ext OEL (G, D, I D ) , X \u2208 Ext OEL ( G, D, I D ) and X = Y \u2229 Z ( \u2200 Y, Z \u2208 Ext OEL ( G, D, I D ) and Y = X, Z = X ). So, according to the definition of meet-irreducible elements, X \u2208 Ext OEM ( G, D, I D ). Thus Ext OEM ( G, M, I ) \u2286 Ext OEM ( G, D, I D ), and vice versa. Therefore Ext OEM (G, M, I) = Ext OEM (G, D, I D ) , that is D \u2208 CS ( OEM ). Thus CS ( OEL ) \u2286 CS ( OEM ). Suppose D \u2208 CS ( OEM ), we need to show Ext OEL (G, M, I) = Ext OEL (G, D, I D ) . Since Ext OEL ( G, D, I D ) \u2286 Ext OEL ( G, M, I ) holds for any D \u2286 M , we only need to prove Ext OEL ( G, M, I ) \u2286 Ext OEL ( G, D, I D ). For any X \u2208 Ext OEL ( G, M, I ), there exist X i \u2208 Ext OEM ( G, M, I ) ( i \u2208 \u03c4 ) such that X = \u2229 i \u2208 \u03c4 X i due to Lemma 1 . Since Ext OEM (G, M, I) = Ext OEM (G, D, I D ) , and Ext OEM ( G, D, I D ) \u2286 Ext OEL ( G, D, I D ), we obtain X = \u2229 i \u2208 \u03c4 X i \u2208 Ext OEL (G, D, I D ) . Thus, Ext OEL ( G, M, I ) \u2286 Ext OEL ( G, D, I D ). Therefore, Ext OEL (G, M, I) = Ext OEL (G, D, I D ) which means D \u2208 CS ( OEL ). Hence, CS ( OEM ) \u2286 CS ( OEL ). So, we obtain CS(OEL ) = CS(OEM) .The first equation of this theorem shows that D is an OElattice consistent set if and only if D is an OE-MIE-preserving consistent set.
