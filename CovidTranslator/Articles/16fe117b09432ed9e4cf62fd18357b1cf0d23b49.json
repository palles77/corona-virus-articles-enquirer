Each year, over 70,000 organs are implanted worldwide. One donor may provide multiple organs, as well as corneas and other tissues, for multiple recipients. The degree of risk for transmission of infection carried with grafts, notably of viruses, is largely unknown and, for a specific organ, difficult to assess. The approach to microbiological screening of organ donors varies with national and regional regulations and with the availability and performance of microbiological assays used for potential donors. Transmission of both expected or common, and unexpected infections has been observed in organ transplants, generally recognized after development of clusters of infections among recipients of organs from a common donor. Other than for unusual or catastrophic events, few data exist that define the incidence and manifestations of donor-derived infections or the ideal assays to use in screening to prevent such transmissions. Absolute prevention of the transmission of donor-derived infections in organ transplantation is not possible. However, improvements in screening technologies will enhance the safety of transplantation in the future.",

Unexpected transmission of infection from donors to recipients is infrequent, but few data exist that bear directly on the degree of risk of transmission of donor-derived infection through transplantation. [1] [2] [3] Transplanted organs might come from donors with unknown or asymptomatic infections, or could be contaminated during procurement or implantation. Transmission of infection is facilitated by the viable cells of vascularized organs. Moreover, immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent immunological attack on the grafts, or graft rejection, may amplify the risk of infection carried by the donor organ. For example, West Nile virus (WNV) has been reported to cause invasive neurologic infection more often in immunocompromised organ recipients than in normal individuals. [4] [5] [6] [7] In immunocompromised hosts with a diminished inflammatory response, signs and symptoms of infection are reduced and the incidence of infection is often underestimated.",

In general, such infections are treatable. Other, unexpected infections could result from the spread of known infections to new regions, such as the recent outbreaks of WNV in the USA or Chikungunya virus in Italy, for which both diagnostic assays and therapies were lacking at the time of discovery. Within national borders, geographic variation exists for endemic infections such as histoplasmosis or Chagas disease (caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi). 20, 21 For some pathogens, screening assays might not be available in clinical laboratories, might be inaccurate (for example, assays for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV] or tuberculosis), too costly or too slow for routine use in donor screening or could be restricted to specialty laboratories. Screening assays for organ donors must be completed within 4-12 h of identification of the potential organ donor to maintain graft viability. Some screening data (such as blood cultures) might become available only after the organ has been implanted. Thus, the approach to the assessment and management of donor-derived infection is a function of disease epidemiology, availability of diagnostic technology, cost of screening, data communication and the degree of risk of infection that physicians and patients consider acceptable to obtain life-saving transplants that might be otherwise unavailable.",

[24] [25] [26] [27] Increasingly common MDR organisms include extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enterobacteriaceae, carbapenemresistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) and other carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE). When transmitted, morbidity caused by these pathogens among organ recipients is high. 28, 29 Among possible risk factors for donor colonization with MDR organisms are prolonged (>7 days) stays in intensive care units, critical illness requiring vasopressor support and the need for cardio pulmonary resuscitation. 30 Unfortunately, in some donors, hospitalization of 2 days is sufficient to acquire MDR infection. 31 Clinical experience suggests that some respiratorycolonized CRKP-positive or CRAB-positive organ donors may be considered as candidate donors for organs other than the lungs but that close follow-up of recipients is mandatory. Similarly, if the donor has a positive urine culture for CRKP or CRAB, transplantation of their kidneys should be avoided unless the infection is eradicated. Some risk exists for unrecognized bacter aemia caused by these organisms; in the presence of MDR bacteraemia, transplantation of any organ should be avoided. The efficacy of appropriate antimicrobial treatment of the donor before organ procurement on the basis of in vitro susceptibility data, in preventing recipient infection, is not known. In general, some period of effective therapy should also be considered for the recipient after transplantation.",

In case series from Turkey, Canada and California, many renal recipients who travelled abroad for organs developed severe infections, often requiring hospitalization.

Therapeutic options for infections with this type of resistant bacteria are largely limited to colistin, tigecycline and fosfo mycin.

Transmission of HBV is common in the absence of prophylaxis based on available data for liver transplant recipients. In a recent review, the rate of de novo HBV (DNH) infection without prophylaxis was 58% (81 of 140 patients) in HBV non-immune recipients, but was only 18% (6 of 34 patients) in previously vaccinated individuals, 14% (5 of 35 patients) in isolated recipients who were anti-HBcAg-positive (that is, positive for antibody to HBV core antigen), and 4% (3 of 70 patients) in naturally immune recipients. 43 This experience has produced a series of preventive strategies to prevent DNH in HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative recipients. A 2007 survey revealed that indefinite anti viral therapy was commonly employed, with lamivudine as the preferred antiviral agent; antivirals were variably supplemented with HBV hyperimmune globulin (HBIG). 44 Although entecavir and tenofovir have supplanted lamivudine in the treatment of chronic HBV infection and often for prophylaxis of liver transplant recipients from anti-HBcAg-positive donors, a new study using a Markov model has now demonstrated that lamivudine remains the most cost-effective option for preventing DNH in the context of anti-HBcAg-positive donors. 45, 46 In heart and kidney transplant recipients, the limited available data suggest that the risk of HBV transmission using organs from anti-HBcAg-positive donors is low, with or without post-transplant antiviral prophylaxis. 47 The available studies are often limited by the absence of baseline data on the serologic status (presence of anti-HBs and HBsAg) and immunosuppressive regimens of donors and recipients that may affect transmission risk. Early studies in heart transplant recipients without prophylaxis did not reveal any HBV transmission in >80 patients, some of whom were likely vaccinated before transplant. 47 Use of these donor hearts should be considered safe and may help to augment the available donor pool. 47 Of interest, HBV seropositivity in the donor or recipient may be associated with an increased risk of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. 48 The risk of transmission of HBV from an anti-HBcAgpositive, HBsAg-negative donor to a HBV-naive kidney recipient varies from 0% to 27%. 49 The definition of transmission is highly variable and includes acquisition of anti-HBsAg and anti-HBcAg; most studies did not require acquisition of HBsAg or detection of HBV DNA in case definition. The risk of transmission is, again, influenced by recipient HBV immunity and possibly by prophylaxis. 50 In a review of nine studies with 1,385 evalu able HBsAgnegative recipients of kidneys from anti-HBcAg-positive donors, new HBV serologic markers were observed in only 45 (3.2%) patients and the rate of HBsAg acquisition was only 0.28% (four patients) with no evidence of symptomatic hepatitis. 51 This study did not explore the influence of recipient anti-HBsAg status or use of prophylactic therapy. Patient or graft outcomes were not worse among patients with HBsAg acquisition or evidence of anti-HBsAg or anti-HBcAg seroconversion.",

Unresolved issues include the optimal duration of therapy for donors with bacteraemia or tuberculosis and with meningitis or encephalitis of unknown aetiology, and the optimal prophylaxis for organs from donors who are infected with HBV, HCV, human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) or human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV). 6, 20, 21, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] When organs are used from infected donors, microbiologic follow-up of the recipients is essential. On the basis of risk factors identified in the donor, re-testing of the recipient of 'increased risk' donor organs is now mandated in the USA and elsewhere (at baseline, 1 month and 3 months post-transplantation) for HIV, HCV and HBV, and recommended for syphilis. Most experts also recommend a long period of monitoring (6 and 12 months) and storage of samples of donor and recipient blood, plasma and cells for future testing. National guidelines are needed for use of organs from donors with known infections. 6",

Clinical recognition of unusual clinical syndromes in clusters of organ recipients from single donors in the USA and Australia resulted in the development of new NAT assays for LCMV and related viruses. Application of nonspecific, highthroughput sequencing tools with the capacity to detect any unusual nucleic acid sequences in the blood was diagnostic of a new arenavirus in a cluster of fatal transplantassociated infections when standard microbiological techniques had failed. 18, 52 Currently, anti-HIV-1 or anti-HIV-2 reactive status in potential donors is a contraindication for organ donation in all European countries and was only recently legalized for HIV-positive recipients in the USA. Three HIV-infected donors have been used inadvertently after false-negative testing or erroneous reporting, resulting in transmission of the virus into uninfected recipients. 23, 60, 61 Although most disease transmissions have involved deceased donors, recent unexpected transmissions of HIV and HCV have shown that recipients of organs from living donors may also be at risk. 22, 57 Donor-derived HIV transmissions have generally had bad outcomes; however, three patients who received organs from an HIV-infected donor in an Italian cluster, including two kidney transplant recipients, are still alive with undetectable HIV-RNA, good CD4 + T-cell counts and functioning grafts more than 7 years after transplantation (P.

Transmission of WNV through organ transplantation was described in 2002 in four recipients of organs from a single donor. 4 This route of transmission is rare; screening of organ donors for WNV is not routine and remains controversial. A long turnaround time for results, unproven test performance, and limited test availability have made such routine testing impractical. Furthermore, transmission of WNV has occurred in the absence of detectable viraemia or seroconversion in organ donors. 65, 66 Low viral loads in blood and a short duration of viraemia in normal individuals present major problems for nucleic acid amplification testing. The kidney may be a site of prolonged WNV replication and shedding in animals and humans. [67] [68] [69] Thus, urine samples could be more appropriate than blood for WNV testing in organ donors in the future. 70 Prospective studies are needed to verify the utility of routine WNV testing in urine (or blood) of organ donors.",

The use of NAT for the detection of viral replication (DNAemia or RNAemia) is a complement to serologic tests that measure antibodies derived from prior exposures or vaccination. A positive serology or antibody test is considered a marker of life-long, latent infection with pathogens, for example, the herpes family of viruses such as CMV, Epstein-Barr virus, HSV, or varicella zoster virus (commonly known as chickenpox). Seropositivity indicates risk of viral reactivation in the setting of immunosuppression. Similarly, the greatest risk of infection with a virus such as CMV is in a sero negative recipient who receives an organ from a seropositive donor (with latent or active infection), which produces a primary infection in a host without prior immunity. Such recipients can either be monitored for viral reacti vation using a nucleic acid or antigen detection assay, or receive prophylactic antiviral therapy to prevent the emergence of disease. Although antiviral antibodies can develop following acute infections, such responses are delayed for at least 3-8 weeks after exposure (called the 'window period'; defined as the time between exposure to infection and serological detection of antibodies. See below and Figure 1 ). Thus, in the immuno compromised host, serologic testing is often not useful for the diagnosis of acute infection. NAT usually involves hybridization of primers or probes to detect a specific sequence in circulating viral nucleic acids during active infection and uses various techniques such as PCR to amplify the generated signal. As a result, when performed properly, NAT sensitivity and specificity are generally high, but the very high sensitivity may produce false-positive results that may confound interpretation.",

Previous guidelines established epidemiologic risk factors for HIV on the basis of the medical and social histories of the donor. 83 The updated guidelines are described in Box 3. 3,84,85 Potential donors are screened for social risk factors (such as injection drug abuse, sexual promiscuity, incarceration or sexual contacts between men) that may increase the risk of donor-derived infection with HBV, HCV or HIV. The guidelines recommend universal testing of deceased and living organ and vessel conduit (spare vessel segments) donors for HBV, HCV and HIV. Routine testing of donors not known to carry an increased risk (Box 3) also includes use of more sensitive assays for HIV and HCV, such as NAT, which reduce the likelihood of infection transmission compared with serologic testing that could miss active infection in the window period ( Figure 1) . 84, 85 The guideline recommends \"a robust informed consent discussion between the transplant candidate (or medical decision maker) and the clinician\" so that the recipient understands the potential risks and benefits associated with accepting or rejecting individual organs including those from \"PHS [public health service] increased risk of disease transmission\" or virus-positive organ donors. 3 Microbiological follow-up of such recipients is mandatory; storage of serum and cells from such donor-recipient pairs would be useful if recipients develop infectious syndromes or if improved assays (or new pathogens) are identified in the future. The development of guidelines, as well as clinical experi ence with the transmission of HIV, HCV and HBV in transplantation, have been instructive in respect to the development of screening strategies. The lack of prospective data on the risk of disease transmission hampers discussions of risk both in terms of the required sensitivity of the assays deployed for screening and in terms of discussions with prospective recipients. Routine use of NAT in donor screening requires development of consensus around the optimal assays, approaches to assay validation and proficiency maintenance, education regarding data evaluation, and improved mechanisms for the rapid communication of laboratory data to clinical centres and organ procurement organizations. Development of effective antiviral therapies for HCV and HIV infections will alter discussions regarding the risk of transmission of infection in critically ill individuals with organ failure. These observations contrast with the lack of transmission data and lack of routine, validated and rapid diagnostic tools, and effective therapies for uncommon infections such as WNV or LCMV.",

            "text": "The 'window period' Serological testing for infections has been highly effective in donor screening. However, seroconversion requires the elaboration of antibodies against a specific pathogen and could be delayed for several weeks after infectious exposure. This window period is likely to result in a falsenegative test result and could result in inadvertent transmission of infection ( Figure 1 ). 22, [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] NAT assays detect viral nucleic acids directly or following signal amplification with greater sensitivity and specificity than does serologic testing. As a result, the window period for HIV detection using NAT is reduced from 22-180 days (by using antibody screens) to 5.6-10.2 days-a minimum 12 day reduction in potential recipient exposure using NAT instead of serology ( Figure 1 ). Similar reductions in the window period are observed for HCV and HBV detection (Table 1 ). [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] The 'residual risk' of infectious transmission in the face of false-negative serologic and NAT testing is estimated to be low for HIV and HCV (Table 2 ). However, in outbreaks of WNV, false-negative results were detected for both serologic and NAT assays, suggesting that dual testing is beneficial for some untreatable infections.",

The cost of the infrastructure required and the need to assure the maintenance of proficiency may dictate the use of regional or validated 'central testing laboratories' in organ donor screening. Assay data may not be comparable between laboratories that use different commercial tests or laboratorydeveloped (so-called 'home brew') reagents. New tests developed in the face of a changing epidemiology may lack validation in large clinical populations. False-positive and false-negative tests could occur as a result. Validation of new assays is difficult, as validation studies in deceased or living donor populations, and for rare pathogens (such as rabies and LCMV), are almost impossible to perform. Introduction of a new assay into the screening panel requires consideration of whether the assay has been validated and can be performed in the relevant clinical laboratories. For example, even in endemic regions, introduction of serologic tests for hepatitis E has been problematic owing to sensitivity issues and difficulties in performing RNA-NAT reliably. Such assays may be used to allocate or discard organs. Tests for lifethreatening or untreatable diseases require assays that optimize sensitivity. Thus, confirmatory tests and internal controls must be employed to detect false-positive or false-negative tests.",

Donor screening has improved with the availability of sensitive microbiological assays that target common pathogens.

Because immunocompromised recipients develop diseases of unusual severity with infections of low native virulence, they are sentinels for new or unusual infections in the community. This patient population has been especially affected by, for example, inadvertent transmission of HCV, WNV and Chagas disease in the absence of highly sensitive testing. The key element in the detection of donor-derived infection remains suspicion on the part of the clinicians who care for organ recipients. The presentations of donor-derived infections have often been obscure, including unexplained and culture-negative encephalitis, weakness, fever, thrombocytopenia, lympho cytosis, erythema of surgical incisions and graft dysfunction.

Screening technologies may incorporate new highthroughput genetic sequencing for new sequences in circulation or multiplexed assays targeting many specific pathogens simultaneously in a single assay. 99, 100 Identification of potential pathogens after organ implantation also has important implications for the need for rapid communi cation of microbiological data or clinical suspicion between clinical laboratories, clinical centres, procurement organizations and public-health authorities. Prospective research is required to clarify the incidence of disease transmission and the optimal panels of microbiological assays for donor screening.",
