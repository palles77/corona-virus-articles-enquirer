In actuality, there were multiple factors forcing the healthcare industry to look at surge capacity before the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. Beginning more than two decades earlier, crises in emergency department overcrowding provided insight into the necessity for flexing the number of hospital beds, providing rapid discharge of inpatients, delaying scheduled surgeries, diverting ambulances based on triage criteria, and altering practice paradigms to allow \"auxiliary\" nursing staff to provide necessary emergency care. Since 2001, events such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and smallpox preparedness have illustrated the need for surge capacity and the ability of facilities not only to flex upward the number of beds but also to supply specialized or specified treatment (e.g., highlevel respiratory isolation). The majority of surge planning has focused on trauma care for victims of multicasualty incidents; terrorist and industrial chemical incidents; and public health emergencies, such as bioterrorism and natural epidemics. There are discrete differences in the type of capacity needed for each type of incident, but there are overarching principles that can benefit surge capacity planning for all-hazards disaster planning.",

            "text": "One of the great challenges has been funding for surge capacity. Health economics in the United States, in an attempt to limit escalating healthcare costs, has resulted in the overall reduction of acute care inpatient beds and has eventually led to a vastly expanded network of industry related to home care and intermediate care facilities. In most acute care hospitals, making the \"bottom line\" is a challenge in itself, let alone providing services and capacity for an event that may never happen, developing resources that are costly with limited or no pre-event funding, and planning for expenditure of resources that may not be reimbursed. The end result is opposing forces and policies in which preparedness efforts are attempting to increase surge capacity while cost containment measures are shifting care away from acute care centers (ACCs).",

            "text": "Surge capacity has been defined as encompassing \"potential patient beds; available space in which patients may be triaged, managed, vaccinated, decontaminated, or simply located; available personnel of all types; necessary medications, supplies and equipment; and even the legal capacity to deliver health care under situations which exceed authorized capacity.\" 1 Integral to this definition are the multiple elements, not solely facilities or beds. Hick and colleagues 2 go on to define surge capability as the \"ability of the health care system to mange patients who require specialized evaluation or interventions.\" This distinction is important because it focuses on the more specialized resources and nonfixed bed capabilities. Historical events and theoretical models provide estimates of the number of acutely ill people requiring care after disasters. However, the definition of an \"acutely ill or injured\"patient is case-dependent and does not reflect the level of care the victim may require. Trauma-related projections range from 100 to 300 patients/1 million population after mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to 300 to 600 patients/1 million population, according to the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) plans. There are limited projections for bioterrorism or large-scale communicable disease models. These include the NBC-CREST (Department of Defense) model estimates of 500 patients/1 million population and pandemic influenza planning estimates of 15% to 35% of the population. The pandemic influenza model assumes a gross attack rate of 30% and would result in five times as many influenzarelated hospitalizations and deaths as in a regular influenza epidemic with the current levels of vaccination in the population, mostly in persons ages 65 and older. 3 Based on data from the influenza pandemic of 1918 to 1920, projections were made with respect to the current population of Germany (approximately 82 million). An estimated 20 million to 25 million cases of influenza will occur, with 200,000 admissions to hospitals, resulting in a total of 1.6 million days of hospitalization, 120,000 deaths from influenza,and an annual excess mortality of 175,000. This is a ratio of 2500 hospital patients/1 million population. Approximately 1.2 million cases of pneumonia as a secondary infection also should be expected. 4 Because of the wide spread of estimations, which are dependent on the causative agent, for planning purposes, many use 500 adult and pediatric victims/1 million population above the daily capacity to calculate surge capacity. A regional capacity requirement example is found in Table 28-1; Region A is an intrastate region in which City A is located. 5 Most projection prototypes assume the current healthcare delivery model, which may or may not be attainable or sustainable at high levels of patient load. Regardless of cause, to approach projected levels of surge demands, multidisciplinary, multientity, regional, collaborative planning must be undertaken because no single component can provide all of the necessary resources. The authors of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality document, Regionalization of Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response, 6 conclude that \"regionalization is likely to benefit elements of a bioterrorism response including the provision of surge capacity in essential response services such as triage, the provision of medical care, distribution and dispensing of prophylactic therapies, outbreak investigation, security management, and emergency management. . . . Coordination of these organizations may benefit from implementation of information management strategies and pre-event agreements that specify response roles, remuneration, and chain of command.\"",

Additionally, the type of incident may require a shift in necessary assets and availability of these assets. For example, the immediate response required in a catastrophic explosion will require a different strategy than the sustained nature of a wide-scale communicable disease event. Few of these models allow for healthcare staff to be among the ill or injured. In the Toronto SARS experience, the incident rates among nurses who worked in emergency departments, intensive care units, and coronary care units ranged from 10.3% to 60.0%. 9 In addition, non-ill providers who fail to report for duty may further affect response. The potential unreliability of the assessment of available resources may be especially troublesome if the healthcare workforce is particularly vulnerable physically or psychologically, as in the SARS outbreaks of 2003 and the early outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. Likewise, few of these models anticipate the loss or compromise of a healthcare facility or access to it if it is located in close proximity to the event.",

On a daily basis, the healthcare system attempts to provide the necessary triage, treatment, and health maintenance at a level that is determined as \"normal operations.\" A tentative balance of supply and demand is struck, based on dynamic shifts within a health system that is typically already at capacity. The actions implemented are variably applied and do not address the root causes behind the immediate crisis of overload: the critical nursing shortage, health insurance inequities, national malpractice concerns, and health economic trends. In many cases, the immediate demand is met and the system returns to an ever-increasing new normal of stress.",

            "text": "During the day, week, month, or season, if a peak in the number of patients is observed, then local, facilityspecific provisions adapt to this increased demand by implementing \"emergency operations.\" This may result in longer office hours, emergency department diversion, longer wait time for ambulances, early discharge protocols, etc. A 2001 American Hospital Association survey showed that 60% of all and 80% of urban hospitals described their emergency departments as \"at\" or \"near\" capacity, as did 90% of all Level 1 trauma centers with more than 300 beds. 10 One in eight hospitals reported emergency department diversion 20% or more of the time. About 20% of the hospitals' capacity can be freed up by discharging existing patients, canceling elective surgery, and calling in off-duty staff. This response is usually (1) area limited, (2) time limited, (3) difficult but manageable, and, (4) occasionally \"routine.\" Repeated or prolonged stress at this level results in either a shortterm (weeks) decay or, optimally, long-term solutions, such as increased staff, re-engineered space, etc. Close examination of these solutions provides important insight into potential solutions to a larger-scale, longerterm surge capacity situation. The incremental costs of re-engineering space to provide flexible utilization is much more cost-effective and allowable under most regulatory systems than is a fixed building or permanent assignment of space. The process involved in changing operations, such as surgery scheduling and staff shift flexibility, provides insight into the impact of long-term disaster services. For example, Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, Israel, can increase the number of burn victims it can handle from 15 to 136 by altering staff allocations and re-engineering space. 11 Larger-scale events, longer-term events, or those requiring specified care will place unique demands on a system, regardless of emergency operations preparedness. It should not be assumed that 100 times as many patients require 100 times the amount of response. At some point, which will vary depending on resources, community, and type of event, a critical threshold will be met in which \"emergency operations\" no longer suf- fice. At this point, \"disaster operations\" are implemented. Efforts such as (1) \"aggressive diversion\" of patients to triage and decontamination facilities, (2) implementation of treat and release/refer protocols, (3) transfer of nonacute admissions to long-term care facilities, and (4) institution of widespread home care plans may be put into operation (Fig. 28-1) . \"Aggressive diversion\" of patients refers to the direction or redirection of ambulances and patients away from acute care facilities to locations that provide triage, decontamination, and/or treatment. This may be done by transportation away from facilities, public information campaigns instructing people not to go to hospitals but rather to seek care at off-site centers,etc. Treat and release protocols and referral protocols may be implemented to allow for expedient care and throughput in alternative facilities or by physician and nurse extenders. Each of these programs requires extensive planning, policy and statutory research, and public dialogue in preparation for implementation.",

A bioterrorism response system may benefit from the pre-event designation of hospitals.\" However, in the SARS events in Toronto, it was found that the transfer of patients to designated facilities may have contributed to further spread of the disease, especially early in the outbreak when control measures were still being clarified and made universal. 15, 16 Well documented in the literature and further described by Einav and colleagues 17 in a study of terrorist-related MCI blast incidents, the most urgent and nonurgent victims are taken to the nearest hospital, even if it is not a designated trauma center. The authors suggest a paradigm shift in trauma care in which all hospitals should have some minimal level of capability for trauma care. In fact, the most recent model in Israel designates the nearest hospital as the evacuation hospital to which all trauma victims are taken. Only the most seriously wounded get surgical intervention while other less critical victims are sent to surrounding facilities after stabilization of life-threatening injuries, thereby making the facility serve as a triage center. In a mass-casualty event, referral and transfer to tertiary care facilities for advanced specialty care may be necessary and desired; however, in the disaster operation phase, these specialized services may no longer be available, either because the services have been diverted to general care or the specialty services are overwhelmed. Additionally, until or even after aggressive diversion of patients to triage centers is well established, patients may still self-refer to the hospital of their choosing for a number of reasons, including proximity, insurance coverage, and personal preference. It may be unpredictable as to which facilities will become a focus for care and likely that many, if not all, hospitals will become primary institutions. For this reason, every facility must be prepared to care for patients.",

It has been suggested that early deployment of local medical centers can alleviate the burden placed on local hospitals. 18 Decontamination facilities may need to be established rapidly to prevent further contamination of the center. Patient care flow in the center directs patients first to a triage process and then to either a transportation section for transfer to a hospital or to a treatment area for definitive care. The duration of care is anticipated to be relatively brief (24 hours or shorter) and may consist simply of observation for further symptoms. Because most casualties in an acute, rapid-onset event (explosion, structure collapse, or chemical release) will be rapidly transported, the most significant weakness of the OST 3 C model is the need for rapid deployment and implementation. Therefore, the OST 3 C facility must be well planned, well integrated, and well rehearsed. This frequently limits its utilization; however, two additional potential roles for such a facility include short-term (12-to 24-hour) observation units and predeployment for large-scale events, such as mass gatherings.

The CERT program is an all-risk, allhazards training in which citizens may initially take actions on their own, and these actions can make a difference. The CERT program was developed by the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) to engage citizen volunteer efforts to augment the response capacity before and during the department's response. In 1993, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) made the concept and program available to communities nationwide. The Emergency Management Institute (EMI), in cooperation with the LAFD, expanded the CERT materials to make them applicable to all hazards. In January 2002, CERT became part of the Citizen Corps, a unifying structure to link a variety of related volunteer activities to expand a community's resources for crime prevention and emergency response. As of December 2004, 50 states, three territories, and six foreign countries were using the CERT training for a total of 1900 CERT teams. 20 Because of the magnitude of a catastrophic event, such as an explosion, adaptations will be made as MCI operations are instituted. Triage will be abbreviated with use of systems such as the Sacco Triage Method or START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment Plan) method, which were both developed for use by rescuers with basic first aid skills to triage patients in 30 to 40 seconds or less. The Sacco Triage Method attempts not only to assign a level of acuity to a patient but also allows available resources to be assigned to the patient.

Individual jurisdictions may decide to staff these centers with personnel who can provide a higher level of care if, for example, screening and dispensing of prophylactic antibiotics or vaccinations are to occur. Several models are offered for establishing a triage and dispensing site, optimizing personnel resources, and projecting the number of persons to be vaccinated or dispensed medicines. 21, 22 The Bioterrorism and Epidemic Outbreak Response Model (BERM) 23 provides a computer model for determining the number and types of personnel necessary for such a clinic site and can be used for planners to provide adequate resources.

Families, churches, and community organizations can be engaged to deliver such services and may be willing to do so, provided they are given the resources, minimal-but-meaningful education, and appropriate protection to do so. Pre-event outreach can organize these groups and allow for adequate support.",

            "text": "Medications and supplies are commonly regarded as a short-term need and vulnerability. In fact, in a long-term event, such as a communicable disease event, supply shortages may become an increasing and broader issue. A disas-ter may quickly exhaust available supplies, including medications, or may prevent the further replenishment of supplies from outside of the affected area. It is important to conduct a needs assessment and have an ongoing materials management process to assess current and anticipated needs and acquisition and appropriation of supplies on hand. In many U.S. disasters, supply shortages have not occurred,but rather,excessive donations have created a different challenge (see Chapter 35). Unfortunately, the preevent purchase and stockpile of equipment can be costly and difficult to justify in the current economic environment and as healthcare facilities continue to shift to \"just in time\" inventories. Graded increases in par levels of supplies, regionally leveraged purchases, and rotation into stock can ease the financial burden of preparedness. Federal response systems anticipate this need and purchase, and strategic forward deployment has been under way at that level. However, depending on the nature of the incident, it is prudent to assume that facilities and agencies should plan on being self-sufficient for the first 48 to 72 hours after an event. This places an additional burden on planning for an event, such as an explosion or chemical event, which will require adequate resources within the first hours or sooner. In this case, outside resources should be used to provide subsequent care and to restock used supplies.",

Limited material supplies may not meet demands, and an apportionment policy should be decided on before an event to allow for dialogue, education, and evidence-based decisions by officials. The speed and mechanism of delivery may vary, depending on the incident. Natural disasters may impede surface transportation of surge supplies. During the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the Pentagon, emergency response vehicles, police closing of roads, and the ordered evacuation of federal facilities created a transportation gridlock, limiting the delivery of anticipated supplies to some hospitals in the District of Columbia (MedStar Health System, personal communication, January 2004).",

            "text": "Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for the anticipated surge capacity staff will be necessary to maintain a healthy staff. Depending on the nature of the event, the type of PPE used will likely be the most protective until the causative agent is defined. Standards for such PPE are well defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In disasters with noncontaminated physical hazards, such as an earthquake with building collapse, PPE should consist of protection for the extremity, head, ears, and eyes. In the prehospital arena, for suspected chemical, contaminated explosive, or unknown contamination scenes, personnel functioning within a \"hot zone\" are likely to be in Level A protection. Level A PPE offers the highest level of protection. It encompasses positive pressure breathing apparatus, SCBA, with a fully encapsulating chemical suit. After the removal of victims and subsequent decontamination, graded \"step-down\" in protection can be made until a level appropriate for definitive protection is attained. For example, initial evaluation of patients with an unknown communicable disease may first be approached with the provider in full highefficiency particulate air (HEPA) respiratory and splash precautions. Once the infectious agent is identified and other potential preventative steps are taken (e.g., vaccination), PPE can be shifted to the appropriate mask and Universal Precautions. Amounts of PPE required to sustain a response is dependent on the durability and lifespan of the equipment (single-use versus multi-use), inter-user transfer of equipment (sharing), and the anticipated number of changes per provider. Durable hazardous materials gear may have longevity of several days into an event, may be able to pass from one worker to another, and is not necessarily disposable after each use. N95 respirators used for smallpox respiratory protection may be usable by a single user over a 12-hour shift but would not be shared and would be disposed of after the shift. Estimation of PPE requirements can be made by the following formula:",

Anticipating the number of needed supplies will depend on the anticipated surge needs and will likely be proportionate to those needs. Adjustments will need to be made with materials managers' assistance to accommodate differences in durable and nondurable goods. Additional resources include prepositioned caches in traditional first responder agencies (police, fire/rescue/EMS) and in agencies such as emergency management agencies and public health agencies. Deployable assets such as the Strategic National Stockpile, the CHEMPAK program, DMATs, and MMRS, have caches of medical materials not only to sustain the function of the teams but for treatment of casualties and patients. There are numerous community resources that should be inventoried and may be available for use. Pharmaceutical vendors, veterinary pharmacies and practices, dentists and dental supply warehouses, etc., may have supplies that are usable and available. Planning for use should include emergency procurement plans, apportionment policies, and MOUs with these entities to expedite postevent recovery.",
