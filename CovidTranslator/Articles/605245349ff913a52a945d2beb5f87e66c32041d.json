This is called a cytolytic cycle; the infection is productive and the cell culture demonstrates cytopathic effects, which are often characteristic of the infecting virus. The host cells are termed permissive. In some instances viruses are produced from the infected cells but the cells are not killed by the process: that is, the infection is productive but non-cytolytic, and may become persistent. 2. Viruses that infect cells but do not complete the replication cycle. The infection is thus called abortive or non-productive. Abortive infections can be due to a mutation in the virus so that some essential function is lost, or to the production of defective interfering particles, or to the action of interferons. It may be possible to manipulate the conditions in vitro to obtain a steady state or persistent infection in which infected and uninfected cells coexist and there is some, generally limited, virus production. 3. Viruses that enter cells but are not produced by the infected cell. The virus is maintained within the cell in the form of DNA, which replicates in association with the host cell DNA. The host cell is termed non-permissive and the infection is non-productive. Occasionally this type of interaction results in transformation, where the cell exhibits many of the properties of a tumour cell. In other cases a latent infection ensues in which little or no viral gene expression is found, no viral replication occurs and the cell retains its normal properties.",

With advances in the techniques of molecular virology, crystallography and modelling, together with the classical methods of electron microscopy, titration and biochemical assay, it has become possible to study virus-cell interactions to a sophisticated level. The picture that has emerged, and is still particles and cells. Under in vitro conditions, the ionic composition of the culture medium is an important factor as both viruses and cells are negatively charged at neutral pH and thus tend to repel one another. The presence of cations, such as Mg 2+ , helps to promote close contact. Adsorption then takes place through specific binding sites on the virus and receptors on the plasma membrane of the cell. It is largely a temperature-and energy-independent process. Viruses vary widely in the range of cells to which they can adsorb, depending on the nature of the sites to which they attach and how widespread they are among cells of different types, tissues and species. The presence of the receptor determines whether the cell will be susceptible to the virus, but the cells must also be permissive: that is, for successful production of new virions, they need to contain the range of intracellular components required by the virus for its replication. The ability of a virus to enter and replicate in a particular cell type is called tissue or cell tropism. Many cellular receptors are protein in nature but they can also be composed of carbohydrate or lipid. There is considerable interest in identifying receptors for particular viruses, as the attachment step is a potential target for antiviral therapy and could aid in the understanding of viral pathogenesis. Specific receptors for selected viruses have been described, but have frequently been disputed. Newer techniques involving monoclonal antibodies, molecular cloning and gene transfer have helped to resolve these issues. It has become apparent that more than one type of receptor molecule may be required by the majority of viruses to complete the entry stage of the replication cycle. Indeed it is likely that there is a complex",

This can often be divided into early and late phases separated by the replication of the viral nucleic acid. Early messenger RNA (mRNA) is first transcribed and translated into proteins. These are frequently non-structural proteins and enzymes required to undertake nucleic acid synthesis and the later stages of replication. Viral nucleic acid is then produced, followed by late mRNA transcription and translation. Most proteins synthesized at this stage are structural ones, and will make up part of the final virion. The eclipse phase ends with the assembly and release of newly formed virus particles.

In some cases, for example HIV, fusion occurs at the cell surface at neutral pH with the activation energy being provided by receptor binding. In other cases, for example influenza virus, receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs. Receptors with adsorbed virus move together (patch) to pits coated with clathrin before moving into the cytosol to form small uncoated vesicles, which then fuse together as endosomes. A proton pump in the endosome lowers the pH to about 5. This acidic pH triggers the conformational change leading to the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, releasing the nucleocapsid into the cytosol. The endosomes combine with lysosomes, which eventually degrade any viral components contained within. This process is outlined in Figure 7 .3. Class II fusion proteins are found in Flaviviruses (e.g. yellow fever virus, hepatitis C virus) and Togaviruses (e.g. rubella). They have different structural features from the class I fusion proteins, consisting of heterodimers. In the acidic endosome following receptor-mediated endocytosis, reorganization of the protein takes place with formation of active homotrimers and insertion of a hydrophobic fusion loop into the target membrane. Viral entry via endocytosis can be independent of clathrin and dependent instead on caveolae or lipid rafts. These are areas of the membrane that interaction between different functional domains of the virus and several receptor arrays. First there is the 'true' attachment step whereby the virus binds to the cell receptor, and then entry itself may involve a further set of receptors called co-receptors or post-binding receptors, acting either in succession or in parallel. These interactions frequently induce conformation changes in the surface proteins of the virus, exposing hidden domains that are required for the entry step (see next section). This more complicated view of the initial contact between the virus and the cell suggests that the binding receptor may not be the only determinant of tropism, and the adsorption process may be influenced by factors such as virus strain, cell type and even the multiplicity of infection.",

Poxviruses become uncoated in two stages. In the first, the outer layers and lateral bodies are removed within endosomal vesicles using host enzymes, and the core lies in the cytosol.

The linear double-stranded DNA is able to circularize, and is found in this form in the nucleus. The next step is integration of the circular DNA into the host cell DNA. This is catalysed by an integrase carried by the virion. It is thought that the circular viral DNA is cleaved leaving staggered ends, and the cellular DNA similarly, to allow insertion of the viral DNA into the cellular DNA; the viral DNA is now called a provirus. The site of insertion is not form capsomeres by themselves, which then aggregate to form the procapsid, a structure without nucleic acid. Often there is proteolytic cleavage of a capsid protein to form the final virus particle, as has been described above for poliovirus. Details regarding the precise nature of the interaction between the nucleic acid and the structural proteins that make up the capsid are uncertain, despite extensive study. It is possible that the viral nucleic acid is inserted into the procapsid through a pore, or it might cause a structural reorientation of the procapsid, thereby becoming internalized. Alternatively, the capsomeres may accumulate around a condensed core of nucleic acid as the nucleic acid is being synthesized.

Envelope glycoproteins specified by the virus are synthesized by essentially the same mechanism as cellular membrane glycoproteins. The viral proteins destined to become envelope proteins contain a sequence of 15-30 hydrophobic amino acids, known as the signal sequence. This sequence binds the growing polypeptide chain to a receptor on the cytoplasmic side of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and enables its passage through the membrane. Glycosylation occurs in the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the proteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus. There they are further glycosylated and acylated before transport to the plasma membrane, the direction probably transcriptase).

Generally the components that will constitute the new virions are produced in high quantities, and the assembly process is probably rather inefficient. Assembly is followed by release of virus particles, the productive phase of the infection. The release is either through cell lysis, as used by many non-enveloped viruses, or through budding, in most cases without cell death, as used by many enveloped viruses. Recently some non-enveloped DNA viruses have been shown to code for a small basic regulatory protein (the agnoprotein) whose function is to act as a viroporin, resulting in membrane permeabilisation and the subsequent release of the newly synthesized virus particles. There is also evidence for active release without cell lysis for other non-enveloped viruses, perhaps via vesicles resembling autophagosomes that contain the newly synthesized viruses. In some cases, viruses can be transferred directly from the infected cell to the neighbouring cells, thus avoiding any exposure to the extracellular environment or to the immune response of the host. The transfer could be through tight junctions or at sites of synaptic contact.",

Here, morphogenesis may occur spontaneously once the capsid proteins have been made, the specificity depending on the amino acid sequence of the proteins. Thus the structural proteins of the viruses can determined by a sorting signal in the polypeptide sequence. In some cases, the signal directs the viral glycoprotein to one surface of the cell only; for example, orthomyxoviruses bud only from the outer (apical) surface of epithelial cells, whereas rhabdoviruses bud only from the inner (basal) surface. The viral glycoproteins are very important in terms of antigenicity as the hydrophilic domains protrude from the surface of the cell, with the N terminus being furthest away, and change the surface structure significantly. They remain anchored in the membrane via a hydrophobic domain near the carboxyl (C) terminus. After insertion into the membrane, the viral glycoproteins accumulate together to form oligomers; at the same time the host cell glycoproteins move away. At the C terminus of the viral glycoproteins, there is frequently a short hydrophilic sequence that remains inside the cell and is assumed to interact with the internal components of the virus during assembly. Lipid rafts function as microdomains for the accumulation of many viral glycoproteins, and may also initiate the actual budding sequence. It is not known how the nucleocapsids are directed to the assembly site. Once there, they are engulfed by the membrane; this process requires bending of the membrane, leading to its outward curvature. In the case of the class I fusion proteins described above, a final cleavage of the glycoprotein is required to make the virus infectious. For example, the haemagglutinin H 0 of influenza virus is cleaved into two peptides, HA 1 and HA 2 , linked by disulphide bridges. The bud is completed by the fusion of the two apposing membranes, and it finally separates from the plasma membrane of the host to become a new infectious virus. For retroviruses, budding occurs by highjacking a cellular pathway that normally creates vesicles that bud into late endosomal compartments called multivesicular bodies. These viruses then exit through the plasma membrane or via exosomes. During or shortly after budding, the viral protease enzyme cleaves at specific sites within precursor proteins to produce the proteins found in the mature virus particles.",

The advantage to the virus could be that the spread of the infection is enhanced as the entire cellular contents, including progeny viruses, are packaged into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies that are then taken up by adjacent cells. In contrast, other viral proteins have been revealed that block or delay apoptosis, presumably until sufficient progeny viruses have been produced within the cells. In this case, the factors target specific stages of the apoptotic pathway. For example, caspases are inhibited during poxvirus infections, the action of interferon is downregulated during influenza virus infections and p53 is destroyed during some human papillomavirus infections. Therefore the susceptibility of the host cell to apoptosis depends on the acute death pathways in the cell itself and the range of apoptotic modulators induced by the infecting viruses.",

They can consist of viral factories in which morphogenesis occurs, crystalline arrays of virus particles ready for release, overproduction of a particular viral protein or proteins, or some aberrant cellular structure, such as clumped chromatin. Virally encoded non-structural proteins are likely to be involved in forming the matrix of these structures and in recruiting viral components to them. Some examples of inclusion bodies are shown in Figure 7 .13. Secondly, the cells may be killed by the viral infection. There are several possible reasons for this, including factors produced by the virus that induce apoptosis (see above). It is likely that the accumulation of viral structural proteins is toxic for the cells in some cases. In addition, some viruses, such as herpes simplex virus and the poxviruses, inhibit host cell macromolecular synthesis from an early stage in the replication cycle, leading to structural and functional damage. Plasma membrane function and permeability change, and lysosomal membranes begin to break down, allowing leakage of the contents with degradative activity into the cytoplasm. There may also be marked effects on the cytoskeleton. These changes lead to a cytopathic effect, seen clearly in cell culture.

The temperature can be lowered, generally to below 35\u00b0C, to a level called permissive, where the defect is no longer functional and the infection becomes productive.

However, they can replicate in the presence of helper virus, often the parental virus, which compensates for the lack of a particular gene or gene cluster. The defective particles retain an origin of replication and the ability to form capsids. One of their important properties is that they interfere with the replication of normal parental viruses because, first, less time and energy are required to replicate the defective genome compared with the full-length genome and, second, the transcriptase complex has a greater affinity for the defective genome than the fulllength one. Hence defective interfering particles, as their numbers increase, have a greater and greater effect on the replication of parental virus.

For example, the three serotypes used in the Sabin poliovirus vaccine have attenuating mutations in the non-coding regions of the viral RNA, leading to a failure to replicate in the brain and less efficient replication than the wild-type strains at the primary site of infection in the gut. Attenuation can be achieved by culturing the viruses repeatedly in cells other than those of the normal host or by culturing at non-physiological temperatures.",

The genome is found either integrated into the host cell chromosome or as a circular non-integrated episome. It is maintained throughout cell division when the host cell replicates. Latent infections are more common with DNA viruses than RNA viruses, perhaps because no mechanisms exist to maintain RNA for long periods of time intracellularly. One example of latency is provided by Epstein-Barr virus, which persists in B lymphocytes as episomal viral DNA with limited transcription of viral genes, probably around 11 protein products being expressed. These ensure maintenance of the viral genome in dividing cells, prevent apoptosis of the host cells, and help to evade immune responses. For herpes simplex virus, latency occurs in neuronal cells with the viral genome being maintained in the nucleus as an episome. All the lytic genes are switched off but one set of transcripts, the latency-associated transcripts (LATs), is abundantly expressed. The LATs can inhibit apoptosis and thus contribute to persistence of the virus. However, whether viral gene uncoating and, in most but not all cases, selected viral genes are expressed as proteins, giving the cell new antigenic properties. At this stage the viral nucleic acid becomes integrated in the host cell DNA, probably not at a specific site, or it circularizes and is maintained in a non-integrated episomal form in the nucleus. The association is a stable one, so that when the host cell DNA is replicated, the viral nucleic acid is also replicated and the number of viral genome copies per cell remains constant over many cell generations. Thus, transformation is a heritable alteration. With some viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus and the papovaviruses, the whole viral genome is normally integrated, whereas with others, such as herpes simplex virus and adenoviruses, only part of the viral genome is integrated and the remainder is lost.",

It is able to transform CD4 + lymphocytes in vitro with integration of the DNA provirus. Genetic analysis has revealed that the viral genome can code for several non-structural proteins, including one of special interest called Tax, an oncoprotein of molecular weight 40 kDa. This protein, which has no cellular homologue, is able to activate transcription in the long terminal repeat of the integrated virus. Tax also affects the transcription of a remarkable number of cellular genes that are involved in cell cycle control and the cellular response to DNA damage. In short, it functions in a complex manner to promote cell proliferation, to accumulate DNA damage with the loss of genomic integrity, and to inhibit apoptosis. However, it is unlikely that Tax expression alone leads to the end-point of leukaemia and further, so far unexplained, molecular events occurring over a period of several years, are probably necessary.",

In vitro this virus is able to transform most types of human epithelial cells, including keratinocytes. The viral proteins responsible for transformation are the products of two genes, E6 and E7, which are found in cervical tumour cells. The interaction between E6 and E7 oncoproteins and their cellular targets is required to maintain the malignant phenotype. Both proteins have multiple functions but apoptosis; for example, the Hayflick limit for cells taken from a human fetus is around 60 divisions. Transformed cells no longer have this limit and thus can grow and divide indefinitely. There are many changes in the surface properties of transformed cells. Often viral-specific antigens are found, particularly ones synthesized early in the replication cycle. Fibronectin, a surface glycoprotein thought to be important in keeping cells together in a tissue or organ, is no longer found. Commonly fetal antigens are expressed, and the agglutinability of cells by plant lectins changes, demonstrating alterations in the distribution of membrane glycoproteins. Finally, some transformed cells form tumours when injected into susceptible animals. Often these animals have to be immunocompromised in some way before tumours are produced, or the cells inserted into an immunologically protected site, such as the cheek pouch of the hamster. In addition, it is important to appreciate that by no means all transformed cells will form tumours. It is thought that there are degrees of transformation and that several stages have to be completed before the cells are fully transformed and equivalent to malignant tumour cells. Viral transformation may represent only the first step or a single step in such a pathway. There are no in vitro markers that determine the degree of transformation; thus the potential ability of the transformed cell to produce tumours in experimental animals cannot be predicted, as yet.",

At the acid pH of endosomes, fusion of the viral envelope and the endosome membrane occurs, releasing the virus into the cytosol (6).
