(C) Dependence on Origin of Travelers and City Size The dependence on these factors can be studied more generally in terms of differences in population size and travel rates by using the above deterministic version of the stochastic model used in simulations. In this context, T 20 , the time between the days on which the number of infected persons first reached 20 in city 1 and first reached 20 in city 2, is no longer random. In Figure panel A, the effect on T 20 of varying the city 1/city 2 population ratio (\u03b7) is graphed (assumptions are that the city 1/city2 travel rates are equal, with R 0 = 1.5, a 6-day infection period, and the epidemic beginning in city 1). The solid curves show that the delay in epidemic spread increases noticeably as the size of city 1 increases in comparison to city 2. Figure panel B explores the effect of differences in the ratio of city 1/city 2 travel rates for 3 different city population ratios (\u03b7 = 1, 1/10, and 10) and shows that this factor can also strongly influence T 20 . A better understanding of the effect of city size ratio on T 20 is obtained by \"switching off\" the travel of infected persons or, alternatively, susceptible persons in the model. Switching off travel by susceptible persons implies that disease can only spread through the movement of infected persons from city 1 to city 2. Since the ratio, \u03b7, does not alter the average number of infections per infectious person (R 0 ), it should not influence the delay in intercity spread if susceptible persons do not travel. The dashed line in Figure panel A confirms this prediction. If, however, only susceptible persons can initiate journeys, then the disease can only move from city 1 to city 2 through susceptible persons from city 2 acquiring the infection in city 1 before returning to city 2. The ratio of city sizes ought to be important in this instance because the risk of acquiring infection from a single infected person is inversely proportional to the size of the population. This effect is apparent from the dotted line in Figure panel A, with T 20 increasing linearly with log(\u03b7) for all but very small values of the variable.",
