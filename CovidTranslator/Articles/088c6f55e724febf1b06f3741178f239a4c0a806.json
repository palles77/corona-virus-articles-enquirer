            "text": "COVID-19 threatens to overwhelm hospital facilities throughout the United States. We created an interactive, quantitative model that forecasts demand for COVID-19 related hospitalization based on county-level population characteristics, data from the literature on COVID-19, and data from online repositories. Using this information as well as user inputs, the model estimates a time series of demand for intensive care beds and acute care beds as well as the availability of those beds. The online model is designed to be intuitive and interactive so that local leaders with limited technical or epidemiological expertise may make decisions based on a variety of scenarios. This complements high-level models designed for public consumption and technically sophisticated models designed for use by epidemiologists. The model is actively being used by several academic medical centers and policy makers, and we believe that broader access will continue to aid community and hospital leaders in their response to COVID-19.",

            "text": "The US classified the coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) as a national emergency on March 14, 2020 . Cumulative US cases surged beyond 122,000 on March 29, 2020. [2, 3] Its rapid spread in China and Italy quickly overwhelmed available hospital beds. [4, 5] County-level forecasts of demand for hospital beds based on data commonly available to hospitals would help guide US hospital efforts to anticipate and mitigate similar bed shortages. [6, 7] In order to plan their response, hospital and public health officials need to understand how many people in their area are likely to require hospitalization for COVID-19; how these numbers compare to the number of available intensive care and acute care beds; and how to project the impact of socialdistancing measures on utilization. Since the majority of people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and the rates of cases requiring hospitalization differ significantly across age groups, answering these questions requires understanding the epidemic and accounting for the specific vulnerabilities of the local population. [8, 9] The numbers of people in each age group differ significantly across US counties, as do the available hospital resources [10, 11] . Initial analyses of the potential impact of COVID-19 have spurred governmental action at the federal and state level; however, significant differences remain in the policies implemented across states and counties. [9, 12] In order to help facilitate adequate and appropriate local responses, we developed a simple model to project the number of people in each county in the United States who are likely to require hospitalization as a result of COVID-19 given the age distribution of the county per the US Census. The model compares the projected number of individuals needing hospitalization to the publicly known numbers of available intensive and acute care beds and allows users to model the impact of social-distancing or other measures to slow the spread of the virus. The uncertainty surrounding the numbers of people infected and the rates of spread make it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of projections generated by complex epidemiological models. The model presented errs on the side of simplicity and transparency to allow non-specialist policymakers to fully understand the logic and uncertainty associated with the estimates.",

If these are not available, the model imports the latest number of confirmed cases from the New York Times online repository and accepts user-entered parameters of the ratio of total cases to confirmed cases (e.g., 5:1) [8, 23] and the COVID-19 populationlevel doubling time (e.g., 7 days) [13] . The effects of interventions that mitigate the spread of infection (such as social distancing) are simulated with user-entered parameters in the form of a greater doubling time and a start date for that new doubling time. County-specific hospitalization rates are derived from combining age-distributions derived from the US census [11] and age-group specific estimates of the case rates of severe symptoms, critical symptoms, and mortality (together morbidity) derived from Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team [9] . The default assumptions are that: people are admitted to the hospital on the day they test positive (the assumptions will change when testing begins for nonsymptomatic people); those with severe and critical symptoms spend, respectively, 12 days in acute care and 7 days in intensive care; and 50% of each type of bed is available for COVID-19+ patients. [14, 15] The numbers of patients requiring each type of bed are compared to the numbers of relevant beds derived from data from the American Hospital Association.

The model presented here fits the needs of local hospital and government leaders, many of whom lack access to trained epidemiologists or data analysts. The website allows such leaders to study projections of the spread of COVID-19 based on their county-level hospitalization information, if these are available, and otherwise presents projections based on data from the rest of the US and assumptions from the literature. The model, deployed as a website, is relatively easy to understand as the underlying dynamics are specified in terms of assumptions interpretable to those with no specialist training.",

First, projections related to the spread of a pandemic at this early stage are plagued with uncertainty about critical model parameters, e.g., the doubling time and the true number of cases in the population. To account for this, the model was designed to produce projections given current assumptions about parameters (with the option to update those variables as better data become available). Second, although estimates of disease propagation follow first-order evidence, important input parameters may not have been considered in the model which may affect hospitalization rates and bed availability. For example, assumptions on shared healthcare resources (such as the use of pediatric beds for adult hospitalization overflow) are not modifiable by users but only by those maintaining the model. Finally, the model estimates the effect of one or the summation of more than one intervention (by modification of the doubling time) but does not ascribe the individual impact of sequential interventions.",

If these are not available, for each US county, the model imports the latest total number of confirmed cases from the New York Times online repository and accepts user-entered parameters of the ratio of total cases to confirmed cases (e.g., 10:1) [1, 9] and the COVID-19 populationlevel doubling time (e.g., 7 days) [2] . Following a simple exponential model, the total number of COVID-19+ people on each subsequent day N is the product of the initial number of total cases and 2 to the power given by N divided by the doubling time input parameter. Users can simulate the effects of interventions that mitigate the spread of infection (such as social distancing) by entering new doubling times and dates for these interventions to take effect. If these are input, the number of COVID-19+ people on subsequent days is calculated using the new doubling time with the previous formula. Users are referred to online tools to estimate changes in doubling time associated with the impact of socialdistancing interventions. [3] Calculation of Hospitalization Rates County-specific age distributions are derived from the US census [4] and age-group specific estimates of the case rates of severe symptoms, critical symptoms, and mortality derived from Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team [5] . For each county, the proportion of each age group relative to the total population is calculated. Severe and critical symptom case-rates for each age group are weighted by these proportions, and the hospitalization rate is calculated as the sum of these weighted severe and critical symptom case-rates.",
