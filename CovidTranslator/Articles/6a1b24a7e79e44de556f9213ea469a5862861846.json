Identifying the underlying cause(s) of such waves may help manage future pandemics. We investigate the hypothesis that these waves were caused by people avoiding potentially infectious contacts-a behaviour termed 'social distancing'. We estimate the effective disease reproduction number and from it infer the maximum degree of social distancing that occurred during the course of the multiple-wave epidemic in Sydney, Australia. We estimate that, on average across the city, people reduced their infectious contact rate by as much as 38%, and that this was sufficient to explain the multiple waves of this epidemic. The basic reproduction number, R 0 , was estimated to be in the range of 1.6-2.0 with a preferred estimate of 1.8, in line with other recent estimates for the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. The data are also consistent with a high proportion (more than 90%) of the population being initially susceptible to clinical infection, and the proportion of infections that were asymptomatic (if this occurs) being no higher than approximately 9%. The observed clinical attack rate of 36.6% was substantially lower than the 59% expected based on the estimated value of R 0 , implying that approximately 22% of the population were spared from clinical infection. This reduction in the clinical attack rate translates to an estimated 260 per 100 000 lives having been saved, and suggests that social distancing interventions could play a major role in mitigating the public health impact of future influenza pandemics.",

An examination of levels of social distancing actually achieved during previous epidemics can provide useful guidance as to the effectiveness of social distancing interventions during future influenza pandemics.",

More sophisticated definitions are required where individuals have substantially different risks of infection; the methods described by Diekmann & Heesterbeek (2000) are useful in defining and calculating R 0 when contact structures and other kinds of heterogeneity are important. In practice, when an epidemic occurs, the effective reproduction number (R) differs from R 0 due to the deployment of interventions, the build-up of herd immunity and possibly pre-existing immunity.",

If a reduction in the infectious contact rate can be introduced early and sustained, the overall attack rate can be reduced. For a given decrease in the contact rate, the relative reduction in the attack rate is smaller for larger R 0 (figure 1). For example, halving the infectious contact rate may lead to a major epidemic being averted (i.e. a 100% reduction in the attack rate) when R 0 Z2, but, at most, approximately only a 20% reduction in the attack rate if R 0 Z4 (figure 1).",

If interventions are introduced, and subsequently removed before herd immunity has increased sufficiently to reduce R to approximately 1, this will postpone and diminish the peak incidence of the epidemic (though not necessarily the eventual attack rate), thus reducing the peak load on health services. Finally, we will argue that if the introduction of timelimited interventions (e.g. social distancing) is timed in such a way as to minimize the number of active infective cases as R approaches unity, then the minimum achievable attack rate can be obtained.",

            "text": "Through a combination of geographical isolation and public health measures, the city of Sydney, Australia, delayed the introduction of the Spanish flu by several months until early 1919, at which point public health officials responded almost immediately (McCracken & Curson 2003) . As with many populations affected during the 1918-1919 pandemic (e.g. Geneva, Switzerland; Chowell et al. 2006) , Sydney experienced multiple epidemic waves. There are several theories explaining the multiple waves, including transient post-infection immunity, viral antigenic drift and the involvement of multiple viral strains; substantial counterarguments exist for all these theories and the issue remains unresolved (Taubenberger & Morens 2006) . In the case of Sydney, the beginning of a second wave coincided with the lifting of public infection control measures, suggesting that transient adoption of social distancing measures could underlie the observed dynamics (McCracken & Curson 2003) . More broadly, Hatchett et al. (2007) observed that the quality and timing of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions aimed at decreasing disease transmission by reducing social contact rates appeared to influence the course of influenza epidemics in 17 large US cities during 1918, with second waves occurring only after the relaxation of interventions. We hypothesize that the public of Sydney in 1919 initially responded to the public health measures and subsequently rising and/or high incidence of cases and, particularly, case fatalities by reducing their exposure to potentially infectious contacts. Bootsma & Ferguson (2007) have documented a similar reactive reduction in contact rates in response to high mortality rates arising from pandemic influenza. As the perceived risk decreased, the public subsequently relaxed, returning to normal behaviour. There is a delayed negative feedback between the contact rate and the incidence, and, as with many dynamical systems that experience time lags, oscillations develop. We assume that R 0 is constant over the duration of the epidemic. This is in contrast to Chowell et al. (2006) for example, who assumed that R 0 differed between waves-we consider this to be a phenomenological rather than explanatory assumption.",

The method we subsequently present in \u00a75 relies on using the historical record to identify periods during the epidemic when the population behaved normally with regard to the transmission of disease. We assume that the public's willingness to reduce transmission relies on their perception of the risk associated with the epidemic. We argue that the historical record, as described by McCracken & Curson (2003) , shows periods during which the perceived risk would be high (owing to high infection incidence or the imposition of control measures), and periods when the risk would be perceived as low. Three periods (labelled A, C and E) are associated with a high perceived risk and three others (B, D and F) are associated with a low perceived risk, and consequently normal transmission. Figure 2a shows a summary of these periods and a detailed explanation follows. If the intervention is not introduced immediately and sustained indefinitely, a lower reduction will be achieved.",

As the incidence remained low in comparison with severe epidemics reported from elsewhere around the world, authorities deemed that the threat had passed and most measures were lifted on 1 March. From 1 March until the reimposition of control measures on 24 March (period B), the incidence rose exponentially.

Multiple circulating viruses may have contributed to the waves in Europe, where repeat infection was documented (Ministry of Health 1920). However, this could not have occurred in Sydney, where reinfection was extremely rare, and when it did occur the symptoms were mild (Armstrong 1920 ).

            "text": "We estimated the effective reproduction number R(t) for each day of the epidemic using the method of Wallinga & Teunis (2004) . The method assumes that the infectiousness function, which describes the rate at which an infected individual transmits infection over the course of their infection (Becker 1989) , is known. We derived an average infectivity profile from Ferguson et al. (2005) and defined b(a) to be the average relative infectivity of a person on day a of their infection; transmission was assumed not to occur after 10 days. The mean serial interval arising from the resulting infectivity profile was 2.6 days. The method was applied separately to both the death and hospitalization data. Strictly speaking, the method of Wallinga & Teunis (2004) should be applied to incident infections. As infectious events are rarely observed, we (and previous authors) must use symptom onset, death or some other measure as a surrogate marker for infection. Two issues arise, which are as follows. First, notifications of markers (e.g. deaths) may be substantially thinned versions of incident cases. Second, there is a delay, most likely of variable duration, between the infection and the chosen marker. Wallinga & Teunis (2004) showed that a small degree of thinning (e.g. resulting from under-reporting of cases) would not bias estimates of R(t), but did not investigate the effect of using only a small fraction of cases (as when using deaths as a surrogate when the case-fatality rate is low) to estimate R(t). In the Sydney 1919 epidemic, the probability of hospitalization and death for a given clinical infection was 4.8 and 1.2%, respectively. We used repeated stochastic simulations of an epidemic with R 0 in the range of 1.5-2.5 in a population of 800 000, with the number of daily cases thinned to 5 and 1% to confirm that thinning per se results in no discernible bias in the resulting estimates of R over the course of an epidemic. If the delay from the infection to the chosen marker (e.g. death) is fixed, there is no bias in the resulting estimates of R(t). Conversely, if there is variability in the delay, then there is a potential for bias, particularly if the distribution of the delay is right-skewed. The effect of the time-to-marker delay distribution is to widen the epidemic curve of the marker, relative to the true incidence curve. The wider the distribution from the infection time to the marker, the greater the potential bias. On theoretical grounds, it is easy to show that during the early and late exponential phases of an epidemic (i.e. its leading or trailing edge), every marker gives an unbiased estimate of R, provided that the exponential phase is itself long in duration compared with the width of the distribution for the marked event. During the peaks of the epidemic, the epidemic curve is not exponential and the above result does not apply. In our case, Armstrong (1920) provided data on the distribution of time from the onset of influenza symptoms to death (mean 8.86 days, s.d. 6.0 days), which is well described by a gamma (kZ2.74, qZ3.23) distribution. We repeated our epidemic simulations; this time, modelling the time from infection to death using this gamma distribution shifted 1.5 days to the right to account for the disease incubation period (assumed fixed). Applying the method of Wallinga & Teunis (2004) to the death data confirmed that the resulting daily estimate of R has little discernible bias during the early exponential growth period and again during the final days of the epidemic. Our application of the method to death data does underestimate R during the middle of the epidemic, and overestimate it at the start of the declining phase; the extent of the bias increases with increasing R 0 , though it is less than 10% for a freely evolving epidemic with R 0 Z1.5. During periods when R is close to 1, the bias is also small-this is reflected in the similarity of the hospitalization and death results.",

To remove dayto-day variation in estimates of R(t) for the purpose of making inference, we fitted a smooth curve to the daily estimates of R(t) using cubic splines with knots every 7 days. Figure 2b shows the daily estimates of the effective reproduction number R(t) based on both the hospitalization and death data. The estimates are noisier during the periods when case numbers are small (e.g. before day 75 and after day 200). As expected,R\u00f0t\u00de begins above 1 and drops below 1 as the first wave peaks, though not by much \u00f0R min \u00f0C \u00deZ 0:85G0:01\u00f0Gs:e:\u00de\u00de. It returns to greater than 1 at approximately day 130 (figure 2b), which is approximately when the second wave of the epidemic began to grow, and remained above 1 until day 165, the peak of the second wave. It is apparent that R\u00f0t\u00de based on the hospital admissions underestimates R(t) during both waves due to hospitals being overloaded (figure 2b). At times other than early in the epidemic when the number of deaths is very small, the estimates of R(t) based on either hospitalizations or deaths are very similar (allowing for deaths to lag hospitalized cases; figure 2b). We henceforth use deaths only to make inference on R(t). Indeed, we expect there to be less bias in the estimates of R(t) arising from deaths compared with hospitalizations. This is because being admitted to hospital is dependent on many factors unrelated to the epidemiology of disease that may vary over time (e.g. perceived need for hospital care based on the case-fatality rate). The maximum value of the smoothed curve during period B gave an estimate ofR\u00f0B\u00deZ 1:59G0:02\u00f0Gs:e:\u00de (figure 2b).

The optimum attack rate is obtained by applying social distancing such that as the proportion of susceptibles in the community falls below 1/R 0 , the number of infectives is so small that the epidemic fades out without infecting a significant fraction of the remaining susceptible population. Here, the ultimate proportion of the population remaining susceptible is s(N)Z1/R 0 (if s(N)O1/R 0 , reintroduction of the infection could lead to another epidemic wave).

Under some circumstances, there will be material differences between the behaviour of these prior immunity models: if R 0 is very large, all susceptibles, whether fully or partially immune, will inevitably be infected; alternatively, if there is assortative mixing between classes of susceptibles, fully susceptibles will be overrepresented during the early stages of the epidemic and underrepresented in later stages. These circumstances do not apply to the Sydney 1919 epidemic-there was a reasonably low attack rate (less than 50%) and little evidence to support strongly assortative mixing.

Indeed, while the waxing and waning of the multiple waves appears dramatic, the degree of social distancing required to explain this (in this case, at most, halving one's infectious contact rate) seems quite possible. More generally, Bootsma & Ferguson (2007) and Hatchett et al. (2007) have demonstrated that variation in the timing of introduction and lifting of non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at reducing contact rates can explain why cities experienced different inter-wave periods, ranging from being so short as to be undetectable through to several months (Taubenberger & Morens 2006) . We note, however, that transient social distancing certainly does not explain why the case-fatality rate of the 1918-1919 pandemic typically was higher during the second wave, as indeed was the case for Sydney (McCracken & Curson 2003) . However, note that the very similar reproduction numbers observed during both waves of the epidemic support our initial assumption that R 0 did not differ over the course of the epidemic. Subject to the assumption that infection at any time conferred protection against a subsequent severe attack, we conclude that approximately 9% of the population were resistant to the epidemic strain prior to the epidemic, and that, during the epidemic, not more than approximately 9% of infections that conferred resistance to the epidemic strain were subclinical to the extent that people were able to continue working. Using our best estimate that 91.2% of individuals were initially susceptible, the R 0 of the 1919 influenza epidemic in Sydney was 1.8, consistent with recent estimates that have used a similar mean serial interval (Ferguson et al. 2005; Sertsou et al. 2006) . The observed attack rate, however, was substantially less than would be expected for this basic reproduction number, and we argue that social distancing is a plausible reason for this. This result underlines the effective role that social distancing could possibly play in mitigating the effects of a future pandemic of influenza.",
