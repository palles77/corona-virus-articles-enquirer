Method: This study estimated the reproduction number and its time dependent change through investigations of outbreaks in Mukden, China (1946), and Madagascar (1957). Reconstruction of an epidemic tree, which shows who infected whom, from the observed dates of onset was performed using the serial interval. Furthermore, a likelihood based approach was used for the time inhomogeneous evaluation of the outbreaks for which there was scarcity of cases. Results: According to the estimates, the basic reproduction number, R 0 , was on the order of 2.8 to 3.5, which is higher than previous estimates. The lower 95% confidence intervals of R 0 exceeded unity. The effective reproduction number declined below unity after control measures were introduced in Mukden, and before the official implementation in Madagascar. Conclusion: While the time course of the latter outbreak could be explained by intrinsic factors and stochasticity in this remote and scarcely populated area, the former in Mukden suggests the possible continued chains of transmission in highly populated areas. Using the proposed methods, the who infected whom information permitted the evaluation of the time inhomogeneous transmission potential in relation to public health measures.

Precise estimates of R(t) are of importance for outbreak evaluation and management; R(t) shows time dependent variation with the decline in susceptible people (intrinsic factors) and with the implementation of control measures (extrinsic factors). It is possible to estimate R(t) directly by closely monitoring the network of transmission; that is, by determining who infected whom. 12 Moreover, a recently proposed method using serial intervals, the time intervals between infection of one person and infection of others by this person (or the time from symptom onset in an index case to symptom onset in secondary cases), permits reasonable estimates of R(t) when such information is unavailable, but where an independent source of infection is assumed. 12 14 The notations ''generation time'' or ''generation interval'' have also been used to suggest serial intervals in other studies. 12 13 However, the estimation procedures of R 0 and R(t) from outbreaks where the network of transmission is only partly known are yet to be developed. This is of practical importance as we usually have only partial information on who infected whom. The purpose of this study is to estimate R 0 and R(t), based on fully or partly known transmission network (who infected whom). We use serial intervals to reconstruct epidemic trees and propose an evaluation method based on the transmission network, tackling previous technical problems in interpreting the transmission potential. 640 www.jech.com 30 20 25",

These two outbreaks were selected for investigation because (1) the total number of cases was the largest among the previously reported outbreaks of PPP, (2) the networks of transmission were at least partly known, and (3) the time of starting control measures was well reported. Each outbreak began with introduction of one index case who incubated the disease during a trip from an infected to an uninfected area. 15 In Madagascar, all data of who infected whom were obtained ( fig 1A) ; however, in Mukden the source of infection of nine persons was unknown or limited ( fig 1B) . At the time of the outbreak, Mukden had just been released from occupation of Manchukuo by the Japanese Empire, and politically was under the control of the Russian military residing with Chinese nationals as well as demilitarised Japanese nationals. 17 In Mukden, the chains of transmission were seen in different households and political areas, and thus all cases with unknown source of infection have supplied us with suspected candidates for the source and place of infection. Four persons infected with Y pestis after introduction of chemoprophylaxis were included with the date of bacteriological confirmation; these dates of onset were excluded when estimating the serial interval.",

The following experiments were performed: (1) using the serial interval, the most probable primary case was selected deterministically based on the probability for the actual interval from onset to onset (this is termed the highest probability algorithm throughout this paper); (2) assuming a primary case, j, sampled from a candidate list, independently infected a secondary case, i, the probability of transmission was directly extracted from the probability density function of the serial interval (for details, see appendix 1; this is termed the serial interval based algorithm throughout this paper); and (3) primary cases were sampled from the candidate lists with equal probability (the equal probability algorithm). As the second and third methods choose the sources of infection randomly from the candidate lists, 100 epidemic trees were reconstructed using the bootstrap method. 19 A likelihood based approach for the estimation of R(t) Using the theoretical transmission networks of the two outbreaks, numbers of secondary transmissions per case per day could be counted directly. However, as it is hard to interpret R(t) when data are scarce and the time scale is in the order of days, we analyse the generalised time dependent transmission potential by using a likelihood based approach.",

[22] [23] [24] [25] [26] It has been suggested that close contacts play a central part in PPP outbreaks 20 21 27 ; the size of an epidemic is also suggested to increase in highly populated areas based on experimental studies. 22 23 This study proposed a method for the time inhomogeneous evaluation of the transmission potential based on who infected whom information. The distribution of the serial interval was conveniently applied to the reconstruction of epidemic trees. In the outbreak in Mukden, where there was a limited number of cases and the transmission network was only partly known, the proposed method made it possible to interpret the time course of R(t) without unrealistic assumptions. R(t) was shown approximately to experience a constant exponential decay, and its expected value decreased below unity during the mid-term of both outbreaks studied. The pattern of decay of R(t) was almost identical in both outbreaks. The value of R(t) reached unity before control measures were started in Madagascar, showing the contribution of intrinsic factors and stochastic effects. In Mukden, the outbreak continued even after the implementation of control measures and R(t) remained above one for a short period; the high population density in this area, which could have increased the chance of exposure, may have contributed to this finding. Thus, our findings enabled us to relate the transmission potential to public health measures. The method of estimating R(t) based on direct calculations from constructed epidemic trees are not our original idea. It was firstly proposed for application with foot and mouth disease. 12 We extended the reconstruction of epidemic trees applying the recently proposed idea of using serial intervals, 13 and obtained the maximum likelihood estimates of R 0 and time dependent loss rate of R(t).",

In a recent study by Gani and Leach that investigated eight historical PPP records, R 0 of 1.3 (variance = 3.1) was estimated, taking into account only the skewness of the distribution. 28 Whereas they obtained estimates of R 0 by simply counting the number of secondary transmissions regardless of time, our method enabled the time inhomogeneous evaluations and detailed the epidemic trees that were reconstructed using the serial interval. Through the adjustments in our method, the obtained expected values of R 0 were on the order of 2.8 to 3.5, which is higher than the previous estimates. 28 Moreover, the lower 95% confidence limits of R 0 exceeded unity. The difference between our findings and those of Gani and Leach 28 originates from the definition of R 0 . We obtained estimates of R 0 at the time of introduction of a single primary case into a fully susceptible population. 10 11 Although the theoretical concepts of the definition of R 0 have been extensively discussed, 11 30 31 its definition in real field settings has remained vague. Regardless of the implementation of public health measures, the reproduction number frequently declines because of several factors, including behavioural changes related to rising awareness within the community. 29 As ignorance of the time dependency and concomitant changes of public health measures must result in an underestimation of R 0 , we have proposed our methods for the estimation of R 0 . Thus, it should be noted that mathematical models based on autonomous system, including branching process models, 32 33 with fixed R 0 over time, could have underestimated the transmission potentials. Although further clarification is required to derive more appropriate estimates, we suggest the above proposed methods for interpretation and estimation of R 0 in the outbreaks such as what we investigated (the outbreak that went into extinction without further exponential growth after the establishment), 34 so that one would not underestimate the transmission potential.",

R(t) declined below unity before implementation of control measures in Madagascar, a comparatively remote and scarcely populated area. On the other hand, R(t) continued to be above one in Mukden, a highly populated area, where PPP is thought to have spread comparatively easily, implying the potential disaster of PPP outbreaks with the large initial attack size in such densely populated regions.
