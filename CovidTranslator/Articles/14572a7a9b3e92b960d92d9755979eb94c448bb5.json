            "text": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefits of supplementation of mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) to cows during the last 3 wk of the dry period on immune function of the cows and subsequent transfer of passive immunity to their calves. Indicators of nonspecific and specific immunity were evaluated. Cows were vaccinated against rotavirus at 4 and 2 wk before expected parturition. Blood samples were obtained from cows before vaccination and at weekly intervals until calving and from calves at birth and 24 h for analysis of serum protein concentrations, packed cell volume, white blood cell counts, white blood cell differentials, and serum rotavirus neutralization titers. Colostrum quantity and quality were measured at calving, and immunoglobulin isotype concentrations in colostrum were determined. Specific immunity was enhanced by MOS supplementation as evidenced by greater serum rotavirus neutralization titers at calving in cows supplemented with MOS compared with control cows. Colostral rotavirus neutralization titers were not affected by treatment. Although numerical differences appeared large, there was a high degree of variability in the colostral rotavirus neutralization titers. Calves from cows fed MOS tended to have greater serum rotavirus neutralization titers compared with calves from cows fed the control diet. There was a tendency for greater increases in serum protein concentrations from birth to 24 h in calves from cows fed MOS compared with calves from cows fed the control diet. Results indicate that supplementation of MOS to cows during the dry period enhanced their immune response to rotavirus and tended to enhance the subsequent transfer of rotavirus antibodies to calves.

During the 3 to 4 wk before parturition, cows are not only challenged by exposure to diseases, but they also must transfer Ig from serum into colostrum to provide immunity for their calves. Unfortunately, the immune system of dairy cows becomes depressed during the periparturient period (Kehrli et al., 1989a, b) , causing them to be less able to respond to challenges (Cai et al., 1994) . In addition, sufficient passive transfer of immunity to the calf may be jeopardized if cows are not able to transfer enough Ig into colostrum to provide adequate colostrum quality (Stott and Fellah, 1983; Rea et al., 1996) . For instance, Perino et al. (1995) reported that calves born to dams with mastitis had lower plasma protein and IgG concentrations at 10 and 24 h after birth compared with calves born to dams without mastitis.",

Greater than 62% of deaths in calves are attributed to diarrhea or other digestive problems (NAHMS, 2003) . Additionally, animals challenged by disease organisms have been shown to produce several classes of cytokines that can increase metabolic rate, decrease appetite, decrease milk production, and direct nutrients away from growth to mount an immune response (Williams et al., 1997; Ferket and Qureshi, 1999; Sauber et al., 1999) . Often, producers administer antibiotics to help combat diseases in cows and calves. The European Union, however, recently passed legislation restricting the use of antibiotics. Alternative products are needed that may demonstrate performance, health, and economic benefits similar to those provided by antibiotics. Feed supplements that can decrease the use of antibiotics while enhancing immune function and passive transfer of immunity are needed to help dairy cows meet the challenges of the periparturient period and aid in survival of their offspring. Examples of dietary factors that can influence immune function range from energy and protein to micronutrients such as vitamins A and E and trace minerals (Goff and Stabel, 1990; Hogan et al., 1992; Franklin et al., 1998) .",

Because some cows calved earlier (resulting in fewer samples) and some later than projected (resulting in excess samples), only the samples obtained before vaccination (\u22124 wk), 1 wk after the first vaccination (\u22123 wk), and at calving (0 wk) were analyzed.

After 2 vaccinations against rotavirus, serum rotavirus neutralization titers at parturition were greater for cows fed MOS compared with those from cows fed the control diet. In addition, serum rotavirus neutralization titers tended to be greater in calves from cows fed MOS compared with calves from control cows, indicating the potential for greater passive transfer of immunity against rotavirus to calves from cows fed MOS. There was also a tendency for calves from cows supplemented with MOS to have a greater increase in SPC from birth to 24 h compared with calves from control cows.

Cattle possess 3 types of serum collectins termed conglutinin, collectin 43, and mannose-binding protein (Srinivasan et al., 1999) . Conglutinin and mannose-binding protein prefer to bind to mannose or Nacetylglucosamine, whereas collectin-43 prefers to bind to mannose or N-acetylmannosamine. Collectins may act as opsonins that may bind to mannan-containing particles, allowing for enhanced phagocytosis by the innate immune system, or they may act through activation of the complement system. Several organisms, including some viruses, have been shown to have mannans with structures similar to MOS (Epstein et al., 1996; Medzhitov and Janeway, 1997; Nielsen et al., 1999; Srinivasan et al., 1999) . Nielsen et al. (1999) reported that concentrations of mannose-binding proteins increased in chickens during virus infections. It is unknown whether there are mannan components associated with rotavirus, however, if present, as they are in other viruses, mannans may be a target of the innate immune response. It may be that MOS acts as an adjuvant by stimulating the production of mannose-binding proteins (collectins) in cattle. The collectins would then be available for binding to the rotavirus after immunization, which could lead to improved phagocytosis, activation of complement, and enhancement of the immune response. Medzhitov and Janeway (1997) suggest that involvement of the innate immune system is essential for activation of the adaptive immune response. They suggest that the innate immune system provides signals that direct the adaptive immune response in the proper direction such as toward a humoral response or toward a cell-mediated response. In the present study, supplementation of MOS enhanced the humoral immune response of the dams. Enhancement of the cellmediated immune response was not investigated.",

In particular, the study suggested that the antimannan antibodies were directed against an oligosaccharidebased epitope and that these carbohydrate-specific antibodies may be the result of a normal immune response against microflora in the gut. Supplementation of MOS to dairy cows may enhance production of these antimannan antibodies at the gut level, which in turn may enter the blood stream and allow for an enhanced response to virus vaccinations. If mannan components are present in rotavirus, the antimannan antibodies may bind to the rotavirus, resulting in opsonization of the viral particles, and allowing for improved ingestion by macrophages. The ultimate result would be enhanced production of antibodies to rotavirus by B cells.",

Colostral concentrations of IgA did not differ between treatments, therefore the amount available to calves for absorption should have been similar. Concentrations of IgA were enhanced in colostrum of sows supplemented with MOS (O'Quinn et al., 2001) , however, serum IgA concentrations in pigs were not determined. Colostral IgA is nonselectively absorbed into the bloodstream by calves whereas in pigs, IgA remains primarily in the intestinal tract (Tizard, 1996) . The retention of IgA in the intestinal tract of pigs is likely related to the presence of large amounts of secretory component in the intestine compared with other species. Supplementation of cows with MOS may have altered the absorption of IgA from the intestinal tract of calves, possibly through some effect on secretory component; however, intestinal IgA was not determined in the present study. Because antibody against rotavirus is primarily of the IgG 1 isotype rather than the IgA isotype (Besser et al., 1988a) , and because IgG 1 antibodies are secreted back into the intestinal lumen of calves, the protection provided to calves through absorption of IgA is likely less important than the protection provided by IgA in other species.",

In contrast, IgA with antirotavirus activity was very low or undetectable in the intestine of the calves indicating that the immune system of the calf was not providing the antirotavirus activity. The authors concluded that, because of the transfer of antibody from the blood- stream of calves to the intestinal lumen, calves that were fed colostrum with greater rotavirus neutralization titers received greater protection against rotavirus in the intestine as the IgG 1 was cleared from the bloodstream. The ability of MOS supplementation to enhance the rotavirus neutralization titer in serum of cows immunized against rotavirus, together with the tendency for an enhancement of rotavirus titers in the serum of their calves, provides evidence that improved intestinal protection against rotavirus in calves may be achieved because of the potential for transfer of rotavirus antibodies from the bloodstream to the intestine. Parre\u00f1 o et al.

Although the decrease in the fluid portion of the blood of cows over time, as indicated by the increase in PCV, may have partially contributed to the increase in WBC counts; the mean increase in PCV was only 8%, whereas the mean increase in the WBC count was 77%. The increase in PCV over time may reflect decreased fluid intake just before parturition or an increase in fluid loss because of parturition. Others have noted alterations in WBC counts in the periparturient period. Kehrli et al. (1989b) reported that WBC counts peaked 2 wk before parturition; however, they did not report WBC counts at calving. Results reported here are more similar to those of Cai et al. (1994) , who reported a significant effect of time for WBC counts of periparturient cows. Cai et al. (1994) reported that counts in clinically normal cows increased from 1.5 wk before parturition until parturition, followed by a decrease in WBC counts through 4 wk postpartum.",

Statistical differences in colostral rotavirus titers may not have been detected because of the high degree of variability in colostral rotavirus titers. There was a tendency for greater increases in SPC in calves from cows supplemented with MOS compared with calves from cows fed the control diet. Other nonspecific indicators of immunity were not affected by MOS supplementation in cows, colostrum, or calves. Supplementation of cows with MOS during the dry period may enhance transfer to the offspring of passive immunity against specific organisms, which may result in decreased use of therapeutic antibiotics in calves. In the case of viral pathogens, where antibiotics are not effective even though commonly administered to calves with diarrhea, the supplementation of MOS to dry cows to enhance trans- fer of passive immunity to calves may lead to decreased morbidity and medical treatments for calves.",
