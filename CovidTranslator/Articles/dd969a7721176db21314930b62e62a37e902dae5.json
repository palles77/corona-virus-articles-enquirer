            "text": "Nipah virus and Hendra virus are emerging, highly pathogenic, zoonotic paramyxoviruses that belong to the genus Henipavirus. They infect humans as well as numerous mammalian species. Both viruses use ephrin-B2 and -B3 as cell entry receptors, and following initial entry into an organism, they are capable of rapid spread throughout the host. We have previously reported that Nipah virus can use another attachment receptor, different from its entry receptors, to bind to nonpermissive circulating leukocytes, thereby promoting viral dissemination within the host. Here, this attachment molecule was identified as heparan sulfate for both Nipah virus and Hendra virus. Cells devoid of heparan sulfate were not able to mediate henipavirus trans-infection and showed reduced permissivity to infection. Virus pseudotyped with Nipah virus glycoproteins bound heparan sulfate and heparin but no other glycosaminoglycans in a surface plasmon resonance assay. Furthermore, heparin was able to inhibit the interaction of the viruses with the heparan sulfate and to block cell-mediated trans-infection of henipaviruses. Moreover, heparin was shown to bind to ephrin-B3 and to restrain infection of permissive cells in vitro. Consequently, treatment with heparin devoid of anticoagulant activity improved the survival of Nipah virus-infected hamsters. Altogether, these results reveal heparan sulfate as a new attachment receptor for henipaviruses and as a potential therapeutic target for the development of novel approaches against these highly lethal infections.",

HS has the ability to bind to a vast repertoire of proteins and is involved in many physiological as well as pathological processes (11) . In addition, the long carbohydrate chains of HS provide easily accessible binding sites for a wide range of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites (11, 12) .

The treatment of CHO-K1 cells with heparinase 3 inhibited their trans-infection properties by \u03fe90%. Accordingly, CHO-derived cell lines that lacked expression of HS because of their deficiency in GAG biosynthesis enzymes (15) were also highly deficient in their ability to mediate trans-infection of NiV (Fig. 1B) . To further characterize the NiV-GAG interaction, we compared the ability of virus particles pseudotyped with NiV G and F glycoproteins or vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein (VSV-G) (8) to bind surfaces coated with the HS analog heparin by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The strong hyperbolic association shape observed during the injection phase of the sensorgram for NiV, but not for VSV pseudoparticules, clearly indicated a much stronger binding affinity of NiV-pseudotyped viral particles (Fig. 1C) , underlining the importance of NiV glycoproteins in the analyzed interaction. To assess the specificity of the NiV-GAG interaction toward HS, by using SPR we compared the binding of NiV-pseudotyped virus to surfaces displaying HS, HP, or dermatan sulfate (DS), another sulfated GAG (Fig. 1D) . Although NiV-pseudotyped virus efficiently bound to HP and HS, we did not detect any interaction either NiV or HeV, washed, cultured for 24 h, and then transferred to Vero cell monolayers, which were used for the determination of the viral titers after 4 days of coculture, using infectious center assays. (B) CHO-K1 cells, treated or not with heparinase 3, and three HS-deficient CHO lines, pgsA-745, pgsB-619, and pgsD-677, were incubated with NiV and analyzed for their capacities to transmit infection to susceptible Vero cells in trans.

Heparin reduced the trans-infection property of PBLs and CHO-K1 cells by 80% and 90%, respectively ( Fig. 2A) . Strikingly, heparin was also active when applied after contact with the virus, and both pretreatment and posttreatment with heparin were effective in inhibiting human PBL-mediated trans-infection of either NiV or HeV (Fig. 2B ).

These results indicated the ability of heparin to elute viral particles from cell surface HS by competition. Accordingly, soluble heparin was able to compete and inhibit NiV-pseudotyped binding to immobilized HP or HS by SPR ( Fig. 2D and data not shown) with 50% and~100% reductions observed for 1 g/ml and 10 g/ml heparin, respectively. Notably, other GAGs found on cell surface proteoglycans, such as chondroitin sulfate A (CS-A), CS-C, and DS, were devoid of inhibition properties (Fig. 2E) , revealing the specificity of the inhibition of NiV binding to HS by heparin. Finally, to determine which of two NiV membrane glycoproteins, F or G, was responsible for binding to heparin, we analyzed HP binding of pseudotyped NiV expressing either NiV-F or -G by SPR (Fig. 2F) . Significantly more binding was obtained with NiV-G than with NiV-F (Fig. 2F) , and results were further confirmed using HeLa cells transfected with either NiV-G or -F (data not shown). We concluded from these results that NiV trans-infection requires binding to cell surface HS via NiV-G, a process that can be inhibited by competition with heparin.",

Permissive Vero cells were treated with heparinase 3, to remove cell surface HS, prior to the infection with NiV. This resulted in a modest but significant reduction in the number of infected cells at 3 days postinfection (Fig. 3A) . Furthermore, the inhibition of HS sulfation in Vero cells after treatment with sodium chlorate significantly reduced infection with both NiV (Fig. 3B) and HeV (Fig. 3C ), the latter being much more sensitive to sodium chlorate pretreatment than the former. The obtained results therefore suggest that HS sulfation status is determinant for virus attachment to cells and subsequent infectivity.",

Heparin pretreatment of Vero cells reproducibly reduced the number of cells infected by either NiV or HeV (Fig. 4A ). Furthermore, pretreatment of either the cells or the virus was efficient, even with very low concentrations (5 g/ml) (Fig. 4B ). To distinguish the contribution of heparin-mediated inhibition of NiV-G binding to cell surface HS from binding to an EFN-B2/3 entry receptor, HS-negative CHO-pgsA-745 cells stably expressing either EFN-B2 or -B3 (7) were pretreated with 0.5 g/ml of heparin and infected with NiV (Fig. 4C ). Heparin treatment modestly, but significantly, reduced the percentage of infected cells from both cell lines, indicating that this molecule may also directly inhibit or delay the binding of NiV to its entry receptors EFN-B2 and -B3. This effect may be the consequence of direct heparin binding to EFN-B2 and/or -B3, as recently suggested (17) . Indeed, SPR analysis suggested that both CHO-pgsA-745-EFN-B2 and -B3 cells bound to heparin, in contrast to nontransfected CHO-pgsA-745 cells (Fig. 4D ), and proportionally to the level of expressed EFN-B2 and -B3 transcripts (Fig. 4E) . Accordingly, soluble recombinant EFN-B3 bound to heparin in the SPR assay as well (Fig. 4F) , fitting a 1:1 Langmuir binding model and yielding a K d of 16 \u03ee 6 nM (mean \u03ee standard deviation [SD]) for the interaction. Additional SPR analysis showed interactions of EFN-B3 with both HS and heparin, but not with CS (data not shown). Thus, by its ability to compete with HS for binding to NiV-G and to interfere with EFN-B2/B3 receptors, heparin can restrict both transand cis-infection by henipavirus.",

Since PO-heparin inhibited lymphocyte-mediated NiV transinfection in vitro similarly to heparin (Fig. 5A) , we tested its antiviral properties in the golden hamster model of NiV infection, which closely reproduces the NiV pathogenesis seen in humans (20) . While all nontreated animals succumbed to infection in less than 6 days, survival in the PO-heparin-treated group increased moderately (P \u03ed 0.017) (Fig. 5B ), thus suggesting a biological relevance for NiV-HS interaction and revealing potential antiviral properties of heparin-like molecules in vivo.",

This report reveals HS to be a cell surface attachment receptor for both NiV and HeV that is implicated in the trans-infection properties of human leukocytes as well as in henipavirus infection in cis. HS has been shown to bind many different viruses by interacting with either one or more viral glycoproteins. Interactions between HS and the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 (23, 24) and with vaccinia virus A27L protein (25) have been demonstrated. Furthermore, HS can bind measles virus hemagglutinin (H) (26) and the fusion (F) proteins of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (27) and human metapneumovirus (28) . In the cases of bovine RSV and canine distemper virus, both H and F seem to interact with HS (29, 30) . Our results suggest that NiV-G interacts with HS. Although VSV-G protein has been shown to interact with HS (31), our SPR analysis indicated that binding of NiV-G to HS had a higher affinity. Further studies using recombinant soluble viral G protein should give better insights into the biochemical characteristics of this interaction and identify binding sites on both ligands. HS has been previously suggested to capture, protect, and transmit HIV-1 (9) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) (10) in trans. Similarly to what was shown for HIV-1 (23), the other sulfated GAGs, such as CS or DS, were inactive, implying that structural features beyond charge density on the polysaccharide backbone could be important for the activity. The implication is that different HS-binding sites may be involved, as shown recently for papillomavirus, for which sequential engagement of three different HS-binding sites leads to virus attachment, interaction with the receptor, and entry into the cell (32) . Likewise, HS stabilizes varicella-zoster virus, making it more accessible for binding to its entry receptor (33) . Thus, similar to its role in other viral infections, HS could improve the contact of henipavirus with host cells so as to help the virus reach the cellular receptors EFN-B2 and -B3 (summarized schematically in Fig. 6 ).",

Owing to its capacity to bind multiple cell surface proteins via negatively charged sulfated groups (14) , heparin could prevent henipavirus attachment to cell surface HS. As it is more sulfated than HS, it could also bind viruses with higher affinity than HS and thus act as an efficient competitive inhibitor for virus binding. Furthermore, heparin significantly reduces direct virus infection in cis, in addition to affecting infection in trans. This effect may also result from the interaction between heparin and henipavirus receptors, as evidenced by SPR for EFN-B3 and in agreement with a recent report (17) . These results allowed us to propose a model for the role of HS in henipavirus binding and entry and possible interference of heparin with viral infection (Fig. 6 ). In addition to the inhibition of henipavirus infection by binding to either viral G glycoprotein or viral entry receptors, heparin may significantly limit virus spread within the organism by blocking binding to the attachment receptor HS and consecutive trans-infection of permissive cells.",

In addition to affecting henipavirus infection in cis and in trans, heparin could constrain inflammation and consequent tissue damage by binding various inflammatory molecules. Indeed, both heparin and HS bind to important immunoregulatory molecules, such as the chemokine CXCL10 (34), which is strongly upregulated during NiV infection (35) . Moreover, as heparin is a heavily sulfated electronegative molecule, it might enhance the antiadhesive properties of the endothelium against leukocytes (36) . This effect may rely on the ability of heparin to bind directly to several adhesion molecules that are expressed during inflammation, including L-selectin (37), CD11b/MAC1 (38) , and P-selectin (39) . Finally, heparin-like derivatives can stabilize the endothelium (40) and help in blocking the passage of both humoral and cellular immune factors, as well as viruses, through the blood-brain barrier (14, 41) . This process may also contribute to the antiviral effect observed during in vivo experiments, together providing a \"proof of concept\" for further development of this antiviral approach.",

Indeed, heparin treatment reduces NiV infection in a hamster animal model, thus opening interesting therapeutic perspectives to complement treatment of this highly lethal infection. Additionally, the acute nature of henipavirus infection makes it more prone to the regulatory action of heparin, compared to some chronic infections, including HIV or HTLV, where heparin showed in vitro antiviral activity (9, 10) . The HS mimetic PI-88 has already been shown to have significant beneficial effect in vivo in the outcome of dengue virus and encephalitic flavivirus infections (42) . The use of derivatives that mimic the heparin/HS structure (43) , synthetic antilipopolysaccharide peptides that bind HS moieties on cell surfaces (44) , or polyanionic compounds with longer halflives in vivo (40) , devoid of anticoagulant activity and with potentially higher affinity to henipavirus G-protein, may further improve therapeutic effects. Altogether, this study demonstrates a previously unrecognized HS-henipavirus interaction involved in both NiV and HeV infection and dissemination within the host. It may allow henipaviruses to bind to different circulating cells, to use them for transport for efficient spreading within the host organism, and for target cells, to allow accumulation on their surface, enhancing the efficacy of infection in cis. These results reveal heparan sulfate as a potential therapeutic target for the development of novel approaches against these highly lethal infections. In this context, heparin or its derivatives may be used in a metaphylaxis approach of virus-exposed and potentially infected animals, before the appearance of clinical symptoms, during regular Hendra equine epizootics in Australia (3).",

In heparin posttreatment experiments, NiV-resistant cells were initially put in contact with either NiV or HeV for 1 h and incubated with heparin afterward, for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, washed, and analyzed in a transinfection assay as described above.",

            "text": "SPR-based binding assays. SPR experiments were performed on a BIAcore X apparatus (for analysis of cells and pseudotyped viral particles) or a Biacore 3000 apparatus (for pseudotyped viral particles and recombinant ephrin-B3), using CM4 (for pseudotyped virus and recombinant EFN-B3) and CM5 (for cells) sensor chips and HBS-P buffer. HS (Celsus, Cincinnati, OH, United States), HP (Sigma), and DS (Sigma) were biotinylated and immobilized on Biacore sensor chips, as described before (49) . Briefly, two flow cells were activated with a mix of 0.2 M N-ethyl-N=-(diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and 0.05 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Then, streptavidin (50 g/ml in 10 mM acetate buffer [pH 4.5]) was injected over the activated flow cells, to obtain an immobilization level of~2,500 response units (RU). One of these flow cells served as a negative control, while biotinylated HP, HS, and DS were injected on the other flow cells, to obtain suitable immobilization levels (50 to 70 RU for recombinant human ephrin-B3 Fc and pseudotyped viral particles analysis; 200 RU for cells). Interaction assays were performed at a flow rate of 5 l/min and involved 5-to 10-min injections of sample over the HP and negative-control surfaces, followed by a 5-min washing step with HBS-P buffer to allow dissociation of the complexes formed. At the end of each cycle, GAG surfaces were regenerated by sequential injections of 0.05% SDS (1 min) and 2 M NaCl (2.5 min). Typical sample concentrations used were 10 g/ml for recombinant human ephrin-B3 Fc (R&D Systems), 1 \u03eb 10 7 to 2.4 \u03eb 10 7 particles/ml for pseudotyped viral particles and 0.5 \u03eb 10 6 to 0.7 \u03eb 10 6 cells/ml for CHO-pgsA-745 and HeLa cell transfectants. The sensorgrams shown correspond to on-line subtraction of the negative-control signal from the GAG surface signal. Competition assays were performed by preincubating NiV pseudoparticles with GAGs (1 to 10 g/ml, final concentration) for 15 min prior to injection. RNA isolation and RT-qPCR. RNA was isolated from cells and plasma by using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) in RLT buffer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed on 0.5 g of total RNA by using oligo(dT) and random hexamer oligonucleotide primers (iScript cDNA synthesis kit; Bio-Rad) and run in a Biometra T-Gradient PCR device, and cDNAs were diluted 1/10. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with cDNA samples by using Platinum SYBR green qPCR SuperMix-UDG with a ROX kit (Invitrogen). qPCR was run on the StepOne Plus PCR system (Applied Biosystems) as follows: 95\u00b0C for 5 min and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by a melting curve of up to 95\u00b0C at 0.8\u00b0C intervals. All samples were run in duplicate, and the results were analyzed using StepOne software v2.1. The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was used as a housekeeping gene to normalize the samples. GAPDH and standard references for the corresponding genes were included in each run to check for RNA integrity, RNA load, and inter-PCR variation. After normalization, the results were expressed as the number of mRNA copies of the gene of interest per microgram of analyzed RNA. All calculations were done using the \u232c\u232cCT model (50) , and experiments were performed according to the MIQE guideline (51) . Primer used included the following: NiV N forward, GGCAGGATTCTTCGCAACCATC, and reverse, GGCTCTTG GGCCAATTTCTCTG; murine GAPDH forward, GCATGGCCTTCCGT GTCC, and reverse, TGTCATCATACTTGGCAGGTTTCT; EFN-B2 forward, CAAGTTCTGCTGGATCAA, and reverse, GATGTTGTTCCCCG AATG, EFN-B3 forward, ATGGAAAGAGACCGAGGG, and reverse, GA GGTTGCATTGCTGGTG.",

While the first interaction is important for virus infection in cis, the second leads to infection in trans and may facilitate virus dissemination in the host. In addition, HS may help the virus to reach its entry receptors and accumulate on the cell surface and/or stabilize the interaction with EFN (B2 and B3). (B) Heparin binds henipavirus G-protein as well as ephrin receptors and may thus displace the virus from the cell surface and prevent it from reaching its entry receptors.
