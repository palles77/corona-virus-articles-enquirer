The objective of this study was to assess Griffithsin's inhibitory effect on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The results showed that Griffithsin reduced PEDV infection of Vero cells by approximately 82.8%. Moreover, using time-of-addition assays and RT-qPCR, we found that delayed addition of Griffithsin had a weaker inhibitory effect on PEDV than earlier treatment. The mechanism of Griffithsin's action against PEDV involved both preventing viral attachment to host cells and disrupting cell-to-cell transmission; its dual mode of action distinguished Griffithsin from most other antiviral drugs. In conclusion, Griffithsin was identified as a potent PEDV inhibitor and may represent a candidate drug for preventing PEDV infection.",

Griffithsin is the most potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) agent described to date, with a 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) in the low picomolar range [3] . Moreover, Griffithsin exerts antiviral activity against multiple enveloped viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) [4] , Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [5] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [6] , herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) [7] and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [8, 9] , and at least one non-enveloped virus (human papilloma virus) [10] . Griffithsin showed a favorable safety profile, with no T-cell activating activity and little impact on cytokine and chemokine release by immune cells [11] , as well as an excellent stability over a broad range of pHs, temperatures and protease exposures [12, 13] . All of these characteristics make Griffithsin an attractive candidate for development as an antiviral therapeutic, but its activity against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) remains unexplored.",

We demonstrated that 8 \u00b5g/mL Griffithsin reduced infection by 82.8% when Vero cells were infected with PEDV at a MOI of 3. Furthermore, 4 \u00b5g/mL Griffithsin reduced PEDV infection of Vero cells by 69.2%; by contrast, the same concentration reduced infection by 76.9% when Marc-145 cells were infected with PRRSV at a MOI of five in our previous study. Griffithsin also displayed antiviral activity against other enveloped viruses to various degrees and had much more potent activity against HIV compared with the results shown here for PEDV [2] . The reasons underlying this difference are not completely understood, but the following potential causes may provide part of the explanation. Firstly, the structure and composition of glycans, as well as the glycosylation level of envelope glycoproteins, may affect the binding affinity of Griffithsin which is a major determinant of its antiviral activity. Secondly, the density of envelope spikes may be an important factor in determining Griffithsin activity. HIV-1 virions have an average of 14 spikes per virion particle [21] (compared with 450 for influenza type A virus [22] ) and as few as four spikes are sufficient for HIV infection [23] ; thus, to block infection by one HIV virion, Griffithsin must neutralize only four spikes. This probably explains why Griffithsin displayed a stronger inhibitory effect on HIV infection compared with other enveloped viruses.",

Further studies in live animals will be necessary to develop a novel antiviral strategy for PEDV therapy.",
