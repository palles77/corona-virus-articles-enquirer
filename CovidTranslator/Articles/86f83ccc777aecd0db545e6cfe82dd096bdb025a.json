Acute and persistently infected bulls may play a great role in the spread of BVD due to virus excretion by semen. Infection at the time of breeding through using BVDV-infected semen causes reduced conception rate, which is most probably due to reduced fertiliTation.

There was a sitmificant statistical difference in the number of IBR-and BVD-positive cows betweem the group with reproductive disorders and the group without disorders, suggesting that simultaneous infection with IBR and BVD viruses may have a greater influence on the occurrence of reproductive disorders in dairy cows than monoinfeetion with either IBR or BVD virus. Similar results, with 93% seroposifive to BVD and 40% to IBR virus, have been reported by others (2) . Microbiological and serological investigations of uteri and cervix rinses from cows infected with both BVD and IBR showed a high prevalence of BVD and IBR viruses (5).",

Data on the effect of BVD infection on pregnancy rates, stillbirths, mortality of neonatal calves and the size of new-born calves in pers~tently infected cattle was evaluated in 8 herds (14) . At the time of conception, a sis'nificant drop in pregnancy rate to about half the herd average was also found. Moreover, new-born calves were sJ~,nificantly smaller than normal calves (14) . In another study (8) , expe~-huental or natural infection of 4 heifers with BVD virus in early presmancy (from 29 to 41 d) resulted in fetal death; 2 heifers aborted and the fetus was resorbed in two other cases. It is doubtful that early pregnancies are terminated by BHV-I infection, although one study (13) reported a ~iLmificant decrease in the number of successful inseminations in seronegative and seropositive dairy cows. The incidence of abortions between BVDV-infected and control groups of dairy cows, was statistically s/~nificantly different, while the number of stillbirths, weak-born calves and congenital anomalies was not. The percentage of nonreturns, average number of inseminations per cow, and calving intervals showed a trend toward improvement in the BVDV group (9).",

Use of vaccinations against IBR and BVD in dairy herds were shown to drop the rate of abortion rate from 30 to 4% (16) .",
