From January to March 2003, faeces from a convenient sample of 879 5-to 30-day-old goat kids from 60 herds were examined microscopically after staining with carbol fuschin. Oocyst shedding was scored semi-quantitatively (0 to 4+) allowing us to obtain a cumulative score per herd. Standardized questionnaires with information about management practices were collected in each farm. We found positive kids in 32 of 60 herds (53.3%) and in 142 animals out of 879 (16.2%). We used logistic regression for two risk-factor model:",

Risk factors associated with simple positive herds were period of sampling compared to the peak of births (After versus Before, OR = 4.2, 95% CI 1.2, 15.3) and practice of kid grouping by age or weight (Yes versus No, OR = 4.4, 95% CI 1.0, 19.1). Risk factors associated with strongly positive herds were period of investigation (February/March versus January, OR = 12.7, 95% CI 2.1, 76.6), exposure to graminaceous plants in forage (OR = 11.6, 95% CI 1.7, 81.0) and type of ventilation in the goat premises (Vertical versus Wind effect, OR = 14.7, 95% CI 2.1, 106.1). No important association was found between www.elsevier.com/locate/prevetmed Preventive Veterinary Medicine 77 (2006) 109-121 kid-management practices and herd positivity. These results suggest a major role of the environment of kids during their first hours of life in the adult-goat premises regarding the transmission of C. parvum infection.",

            "text": "Cryptosporidium parvum infection is one of the principal enteropathogens in neonatal goats (De Graaf et al., 1999) and has been reported in French dairy goats since 1983 (Polack et al., 1983) . In both natural and experimental conditions, cryptosporidial infection is associated with diarrhoea and mortality in kids aged 1-2 weeks (Nagy et al., 1984; Thamsborg et al., 1990; Koudela and Jiri, 1997; Vieira et al., 1997) . As demonstrated in natural conditions in calves, oocyst excretion mainly occurs beginning on day 3-6 postinfection, continuing for 6-9 days and usually persisting at a detectable but asymptomatic level until 1 month of age (Olson et al., 1997; Uga et al., 2000; Castro-Hermida et al., 2002) . However, clinical cryptosporidiosis occasionally occurs in goats >4 week old (Johnson et al., 1999) . Because no fully satisfactory chemoprophylaxis is available to control neonatal cryptosporidiosis (De Graaf et al., 1999) , a better knowledge of the main risk factors of C. parvum infection in kids is needed to allow the implementation of preventive hygienic measures both reducing the environmental oocyst burden and preventing the transmission to neonates. Such epidemiological information is relatively scarce in dairy-goat farms compared to farms with other ruminants except for some data from Spain (Matos-Fernandez et al., 1994) and from Poland (Majewska et al., 2000) . Our aim was to assess herd-level risk factors for two different levels of oocyst shedding from kids.",

Normality of the continuous variables was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test (Royston, 1995) . Multivariable analysis consisted in a backward stepwise logistic regression with a procedure minimising the Akaike Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974) . The stepwise method based on AIC that we used was based on the stepAIC function (Venables and Ripley, 1999) (STEP procedure for glm models, R statistical software). The R function calculates the AIC according to the formula (R Documentation): AIC = \u00c02 \u00c2 log-likelihood + k \u00c2 npar, where npar represents the number of parameters in the fitted model, and k = 2 for the usual AIC. The starting candidate model was based on all of the predictors with p < 0.10 in the screening. Subsequent models were based on omitting a variable from the current candidate model or adding a variable that was not in the model, with the choice based on minimizing AIC. The final model was found when adding or omitting a variable did not reduce AIC further.",

To simplify our statistical approach, we could have preserved only one of the redundant variables, and discarded the other one, before the backward-elimination process.

However, those techniques do not assess the statistical significance of the direct associations between specific independent variables and the dependent variable. Variable-selection methods attempt to balance the goodness-of-fit of a model with considerations of parsimony. However this is done, in theory one could look at all possible logistic-regression models to find the ''best'' one, but this becomes computationally prohibitive when p is large. For this reason, it is more classical to use a stepwise procedure, where candidate models are based on adding or removing a term from the current ''best'' model.",

            "text": "The period of sampling was linked to the risk of C. parvum infection with February/ March period being more at risk than January (OR = 12.7). Monthly variations in prevalence were also recorded by Bourgoin (1996) and Lefay et al. (2000) in cattle in France and by Causape et al. (2002) in lambs in Spain. One of the likely explanations is the hygienic degradation of the neonates' environment and the simultaneous increase in disease incidence during the whole kidding or calving period especially when parturition is highly seasonal. This is particularly the case in dairy-goat breeding where kidding period mainly extends from November to March with the neonates' premises not being cleaned during this period. Otherwise, changes in crowding of premises or multiple peaks of newborn animals may account for seasonal variations in Cryptosporidium oocyst shedding (Huetink et al., 2001) .",

This surprised us, because an extensive previous study of Atwill et al. (1998) performed in a similar system where dairy calves are immediately separated from their dams brought some evidence of the key role of environment in the contamination with Cryptosporidium. Those authors demonstrated the role of the floors and the walls of calf hutches in the transmission of cryptosporidial infection to neonates whereas the dam excretion was undetectable. Similarly, significant relationships between some calf-environment factors such as ventilation, frequency of disposal or addition of bedding, feeding, calf-to-calf contact and the odds of shedding C. parvum oocysts have been described (Maldonado-Camargo et al., 1998; Mohammed et al., 1999; Sischo et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "In contrast, other results suggest an important role of the dam in the direct contamination of their offsprings. According to both the prepatent period of C. parvum infection and the breeding conditions of dairy calves in the Netherlands (immediate removal of calves from their dams, rearing in individual hutches), Huetink et al. (2001) considered that direct or indirect cow-to-calf transmission was probably the most important route of infection followed by indirect calf-to-calf transmission through vectors (caretakers, insects). Asymptomatic adult cattle or sheep can be inapparent carriers especially around parturition when an increase in oocyst output generally occurs (Xiao et al., 1994; Ortega-Mora et al., 1999; Ralston et al., 2003; Faubert and Litvinsky, 2000) . Similarly, >25% of the goats >1 year old shed oocysts (Noordeen et al., 2001) . Thus the risk factors we found (which mainly involved adult-goat management) have to be interpreted in relation with oocyst contamination, i.e output and persistency in adult premises. The vertical ventilation (ridge tile) appeared as a risk factor and this might be related to a more efficient system (compared to horizontal ventilation) leading to a paradoxically more favourable environment for the oocyst survival due to a lower level of ammonia in the litter (Jenkins et al., 1999; Walker et al., 1998) . We also found that the type of the diet given to the adult goat was associated with an increased risk of C. parvum infection prevalence in kids. Forages might be involved through a direct (contaminated feed) or an indirect effect. Very little information is available on survival of oocysts in forage except the data of Merry et al. (1997) on ryegrass ensilage showing a 30% survival after 3 months. Except for contamination with rodent or pet faeces after collection, the survival of occysts on hay is expected to be very low if any because of the dryness of such a material. The impact of graminaceous versus leguminous in the diet on oocyst excretion remains to be investigated.",
