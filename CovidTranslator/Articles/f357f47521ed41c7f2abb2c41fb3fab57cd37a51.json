            "text": "R espiratory tract infections occur frequently in early infancy and account for a major percentage of morbidity and mortality in childhood. Virus infections seem to be responsible for most of this burden. Since the introduction of molecular detection techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the percentage of pathogens found during respiratory tract illnesses in published studies has increased dramatically, up to 85%. [1] [2] [3] [4] Although many studies have investigated the prevalence of respiratory pathogens during respiratory illnesses, little is known about the prevalence of pathogens in nonsymptomatic children. Whether pathogens are actually the cause of the respiratory symptoms or are simply colonizing the respiratory tract during symptomatic episodes remains unclear. It can be speculated that not every infection with a pathogen leads to respiratory symptoms and that pathogenicity might depend on host or environmental factors. In young children, the respiratory and immune systems are immature and may be more susceptible to respiratory pathogens. 5 We hypothesized that infections with respiratory pathogens are likely to have the most serious effect on young children with developing respiratory and immunologic systems. Furthermore, we hypothesized that infection with multiple respiratory pathogens will more often lead to respiratory symptoms compared with infection with a single pathogen. [6] [7] [8] [9] The aims of our study were to determine the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in the presence or absence of respiratory tract symptoms in prospectively sampled young children, and to identify whether age and coinfections modify the impact of a pathogen on illness. Sensitive PCR techniques were used to detect 13 common respiratory pathogens, 11 viruses, and 2 atypical bacteria.",

This is in keeping with studies in which coronaviruses accounted for approximately 1/3 of common colds in children. 15 Coronaviruses often were found in multiple infections, [15] [16] [17] which suggest a relatively mild pathogenicity of coronaviruses. The recovery of both RSV and influenza virus was remarkably low in our study, possibly due to the small number and the varying ages (0 to 7 years) of the children enrolled in this study. Of the asymptomatic children, 40% carried 1 or more pathogens. In the literature, the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in samples from asymptomatic children ranges from 5% to 68%. 3, [18] [19] [20] [21] This wide range may be explained by differences in study populations, definitions of symptoms, and sampling and virus detection methods. Most of these studies were performed in older children, usually hospitalized for elective surgery. Furthermore, most of the studies are of a cross-sectional design comparing single symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes in different subjects. Such a design disregards the natural variation of virus colonization in an individual during a certain period. Winther et al 20 also sampled longitudinally and found a 9% prevalence of picornavirus in asymptomatic children. This discrepancy with our findings may be explained by the fact that those authors used a period of 4 weeks around the onset of respiratory illness to define symptomatic episodes.",

Comparable strains were present in both mother and child, leading the authors to conclude that intestinal bacteria are derived from the intestinal microbiome of the mother.Knowledge about the composition of the gut microbiota has been advanced by using molecular techniques to define resident organisms. 1 We now know that most organisms present in the intestine cannot be grown with standard culture techniques. A study of 3 healthy Canadian adults was the first to use molecular approaches to characterize the human intestinal microbiome. 2 A subsequent study of the colonic microbiota of 7 members from 1 family in China highlighted differences in the resident microflora compared with those found in Canadians. 3 A detailed molecular analysis of the developing gut flora in human infants is limited to 1 study, which evaluated microbes present in stools obtained from 14 healthy babies obtained sequentially every 2 weeks during the first year of life. 4 The microbiota varied considerably between each of the infants and showed marked changes in composition with time. A complete cataloguing of the resident microflora of the gut, oral cavity, skin, and vagina is an overriding aim of international microbiome projects. 5 ",
