Time, temperature and quantity of each reagent were optimised for the detection of the two viruses. This method was more sensitive than the conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting the two viruses. The RT-LAMP reaction is highly suited for disease diagnosis in developing countries. Amplification of DNA can be detected without the use of agarose gel electrophoresis, by the production of a whitish precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate as a by-product. The cost of RT-LAMP for one reaction is nearly 4 times less than that of RT-PCR.",

MrNV is a small icosahedral non-enveloped particle, 26-27 nm in diameter, identified in the cytoplasm of connective tissue cells. It contains a genome consisting of two linear single stranded positive sense RNA segments, RNA1 of 2.9 kb, which encodes the viral part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RNA2 of 1.3 kb that encodes the capsid protein. The capsid contains a single polypeptide of 43 kDa (cp-43) (Bonami et al., 2005) . XSV is also an icosahedral virus with a diameter of 14-16 nm. Its genome consists of a linear single stranded positive sense RNA about 0.9 kb coding for a capsid protein, cp-17 Sri Widada et al., 2004) . Because of its extremely small size and the absence of a gene which codes for enzymes required for viral RNA replication, it has been suggested that XSV may be a satellite virus, while MrNV plays the role of a helper virus (Sri Widada et al., 2004) . The linear correlation between MrNV and XSV genome copies in infected prawns confirmed that XSV is a satellite virus, dependent on MrNV, but its role in the pathogenicity of WTD remains unclear (Zhang et al., 2006) .",

Various diagnostic methods have been developed for detection of these viruses including histopathology, serological methods, and genome based detection methods. Sandwich ELISA (Romestand and Bonami, 2003) and three genome based methods, i.e., dot blot hybridization, in situ hybridization and RT-PCR (Sri Widada et al., 2003 , are available for detection of WTD.",

It is a specific nucleic acid amplification technique that can amplify target nucleic acid to 10 9 copies at 60-65 \u2022 C in 1 h (Notomi et al., 2000; Parida et al., 2004; Savan et al., 2005) . The method relies on autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis by the Bst DNA polymerase large fragment, a DNA polymerase with high strand displacement activity. Using this technique, the presence of the virus can be detected successfully in 1 h by observing the formation of a white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate. As the reaction is carried out under isothermal conditions, it can be conducted with a simple and inexpensive water bath (Notomi et al., 2000; Parida et al., 2004; Savan et al., 2005) . There is no time loss of thermal change due to the isothermal reaction and the inhibition reaction at the later stage of amplification is less likely to occur, compared with the PCR.",

The optimum time required for amplification by RT-LAMP was studied for both MrNV with set VII primers and XSV with set II primers.

The maximum precipitate was obtained with 12 mM MgSO 4 (10 mM MgSO 4 + 2 mM MgSO 4 present in the buffer) and 14 mM MgSO 4 . Hence, the addition of 10 mM MgSO 4 to the reaction mix to obtain a total concentration of 12 mM was taken as the optimum concentration. RT-LAMP worked well both with 0.6 M and 0.8 M betaine.

In this study, extensive standardisation of the RT-LAMP method has been carried out to increase its efficiency and rapidity for the detection of MrNV and XSV in M. rosenbergii. In an earlier study, it was established that the RT-LAMP reaction for the detection of MrNV and XSV works well at 63 \u2022 C and 65 \u2022 C (Pillai et al., 2006) . Further studies with different primer set combinations have again reaffirmed that the optimum temperature for RT-LAMP assay is 63 \u2022 C or 65 \u2022 C. However, since reverse transcriptase is used in the RT-LAMP assay, and considering the convenience of use of the LAMP method for detection of the two viruses simultaneously, all further reactions were carried out at 63 \u2022 C for both MrNV (with set VII primers) and XSV (with set II primers). In their study on detection of West Nile virus by RT-LAMP, Parida et al. (2004) observed the efficiency of amplification to be optimal at 63 \u2022 C.",

The present studies with primer set VII for MrNV showed that amplification begins to occur in 15 min. In the present study, the time to obtain a white precipitate has been reduced to 15 min by the choice of appropriate primers. The time required for initiation of amplification in the case of XSV was also the same as MrNV. The earlier studies by us showed that the accelerated LAMP reaction by the use of loop primers could reduce the time for appearance of the white precipitate to 20 min (Pillai et al., 2006) . However, nonspecific amplification appeared to be a problem with the use of additional primers (Pillai et al., 2006) . Since highly visible whitish precipitate could be obtained with LAMP primer VII by the use of 4 primers in 15 min, loop primers were not used in the present study. The RT-LAMP assay (without loop primers) for MrNV and XSV reported here showed exceptionally high rapidity in comparison with LAMP assays of other RNA and DNA viruses.",

Even though a slight amplification was observed in uninfected sample in spectrophotometer reading, it remained more like background amplification and was not found to increase with the increasing amounts of template. With the LAMP reaction, there was no inhibition of amplification with increasing amounts of template used. This is an advantage of RT-LAMP over RT-PCR since increase in template beyond the optimal level could actually inhibit detection by RT-PCR (Sri Widada et al., 2003; Sahul Hameed et al., 2004) .",

Though RT-LAMP has many advantages over RT-PCR, our experience has shown that RT-LAMP needs highly purified template RNA for assay. In an earlier trial, non-specific DNA amplification, including formation of white precipitate, was observed in uninfected samples using RNA without prior DNAse and proteinase treatment. This problem was solved by the use of ultra pure RNA. In their study on detection of food borne salmonella in raw milk by LAMP, Wang et al. (2008) demonstrated very clearly the importance of nucleic acid purity in the LAMP reaction. Another disadvantage of the LAMP assay is that the high sensitivity and very large amount of amplified DNA produced makes it susceptible to false positive reactions because of cross-contamination. Hence, the necessary precautions should be taken during extraction of RNA and preparation of the reaction mix.",
