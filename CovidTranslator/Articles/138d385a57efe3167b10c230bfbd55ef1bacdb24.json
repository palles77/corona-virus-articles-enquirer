Epidemiological evidence as well as animal studies have shown that influenza infections are more severe during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, resulting in greater morbidity and mortality, although the reason for this is still unclear. Our laboratory has taken advantage of 20 years of experience studying the murine immune response to respiratory viruses to address questions of altered immunity during pregnancy. With clinical studies and unique animal model systems, we are working to define the mechanisms responsible for altered immune responses to influenza infection during pregnancy and what roles hormones such as estrogen or progesterone play in these alterations.",

            "text": "From the immunologist's point of view, the interplay between steroid hormones and the immune system is intriguing. The systemic expression level of sex hormones differs according to age, gender and pregnancy status in women. Most if not all immune cells express receptors for sex hormones. T cells, B cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells all have been shown to be transcriptionally regulated by estrogen [3] [4] [5] . The effect of steroid hormones on immune cells has been a target of extensive study [6] . Although a number of laboratories have reported on estrogen's effects at the molecular and cellular level, the role of hormones in a systemically coordinated immune response has been difficult to ascertain, let alone in the complex milieu of pregnancy. As gestation progresses, estradiol levels in the maternal serum can rise as much as 500-fold against a backdrop of many maternal or placental-derived hormones that also fluctuate in serum. It is clear, though, that the influence of steroid hormones on immune cells occurs throughout the body and affects various organ systems, including the respiratory system during viral infection, and the nervous system during autoimmune attack. Alterations observed in some autoimmune disease states during pregnancy have been linked to estrogen signaling [7] [8] [9] . Relapse rates of multiple sclerosis decline during pregnancy and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms remit as pregnancy progresses, correlating strongly with estrogen levels [10, 11] . Due to the striking remission in autoimmune symptoms, pregnancy is often described as a time of pure immunosuppression.",

Increase risk of severe Varicella zoster [12] , SARS [13, 14] , Listeria monocytogenes [15] , Plasmodium falciparum [16] infections have all been observed during pregnancy. Since the 1918 influenza pandemic, it has been apparent that pregnant women suffer more severe complications from influenza infections than non-pregnant women (Fig. 1 ). In 1918, the death rate for men and women of child-bearing age infected with influenza climbed to about 1 % [17] . For pregnant women, the rate was 27 %, and in cases complicated with pneumonia, over 50 % [18] . This pattern is borne out by every major pandemic of the last century, including the recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, women in the second and third trimesters have higher mortality and morbidity rates than first trimester women. Similar observations have been made in response to seasonal strains, albeit to a lesser degree [22] .",

These studies suggest that, although the virus is restricted to the maternal lungs, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 may compromise the fetus. This is no small problem. There are six million pregnant women per year in the United States and it is estimated that *10 % will be infected by influenza [29] . In pandemic years, the number will increase.

Yet researchers have speculated that a shift to Th2 immunity is responsible for the altered responses in the periphery to respiratory viral infections [31] or autoantigens [32, 33] . Most evidence supporting a Th2 shifts derives from studies of material/fetal interface rather than systemic immunity. Although inflammatory events have been shown to be important at critical times at the beginning and end of gestation, for the most part, the uterine environment is biased toward Th2 [34] .

            "text": "Alterations occur in the systemic immune system during pregnancy that could explain both the reduction in autoimmune attacks and the increased severity to influenza infections. We have found a decrease in the total number of CD3? T cells in blood. The surge in estrogen and progesterone at the end of the first trimester results in a reversible thymic involution during pregnancy, which is likely responsible for this decrease in both CD4 and CD8 T cells [36, 37] . However, the T-cell defect is more than just a reduction in newly released thymocytes. TSST-stimulated CD45RA? (na\u00efve) T cells isolated from the periphery during pregnancy show a profound decrease in both Th1 and Th2 cytokines when compared to cells from the same subjects collected in the post-partum period [38] . Therefore, in addition to a reduction in T cell numbers in the blood during pregnancy, the cells have broadly reduced activity when stimulated without any apparent bias toward a Th2 phenotype. NK cells are critically important in early pregnancy. Uterine NK (uNK) cells mediate trophoblast invasion and placental redesign early in gestation [39] . Up to 70 % of the decidual stromal leukocytes are NK cells, and depletion studies have shown them to be vital to the pregnancy. The current understanding is that after the placenta is established, the role of NK cells is less important, and their numbers in the decidua decrease [40] . Interestingly, in our study, NK cells numbers in the periphery begin decrease as well after 20-week gestation [38] .",

Their secretion of cytokines, either in the unstimulated state or when stimulated with either IL-2 (unpublished data) or a combination of IL-12 and IL-15, is significantly impaired, impacting their ability to amplify adaptive immune responses.

This could conceivably shift the antigenspecific autoimmune response away from a pathogenic Th1 response. Although the role of NK cells in the immunopathology of RA and MS is still unclear, the alteration in function of NK cells during pregnancy could be an intriguing component of the altered phenotype seen in these diseases during pregnancy [44, 45] .",

Others have noted similar stability [50, 52, 53] . The observation that individuals have different but stable cytokine fingerprints is intriguing. Not only can these patterns be used as possible biomarkers for disease susceptibility but they might be able to predict the protein content of immune cells. For example, NK cells have a welldescribed IL-12/IFNc loop where IL-12 binding by NK cells leads to enhanced secretion of IFNc from stimulated cells. In our cohort, NK cells from subjects with the highest serum concentrations of IL-12 showed a statistically significant increase in IFNc, demonstrating that the IL-12 in serum was active and influenced the activation status of the circulating NK cells.",

The objective was to estimate the effects of gestational age and other maternal factors on immunologic responses to influenza vaccination. We recruited over 230 women over the 4-year study and measured the seroconversion rate of each influenza A strain in the seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza (TIV) vaccine. In 2009, we adapted our protocol to include the measurement of the pandemic H1N1 response, which was administered in a separate vaccine. We identified no statistically significant differences in seroconversion rates according to trimester of vaccination. However, we observed somewhat lower rates of seroconversion for women vaccinated in the first trimester and for obese women. In a multivariable model, higher baseline antibody levels and prior year flu vaccination were both significantly associated with reduced odds of seroconversion (Sperling et al. in press). The downregulation of immunity that occurs through thymic involution and B-cell lymphopoiesis apparently does not hinder the antibody response to influenza vaccine. Whether this would be true for other vaccines that might rely more on primary responses is not known and should be explored (Fig. 4) .",

Although biological differences exist in placentation between mice and human [61] , some early work in mouse models demonstrates that there is reason to believe that mechanisms impacting immunity in pregnancy are conserved. It has been demonstrated that infection during pregnancy impacts litter size and health [62] . Pregnant mice experience increased mortality that correlates with late-term pregnancy [63] , analogous to observations in the final trimester of human pregnancy. These observations have recently been confirmed using the 2009 pandemic H1N1 Influenza A strain [43] . Pregnant mice have altered or delayed cytokine production similar to observations in pregnant women [43] . Even though these models have been used for at least 50 years, the mechanism of increased morbidity and mortality in pregnant mice remains unclear. To help answer this question, we adapted our aerosolbased model to study influenza virus infection during pregnancy. Because gestation in mice is short, very strict timing must be used to reproduce infection during late-term pregnancy. Animals are infected at E10 and analyzed throughout infection to the end of term.",

Hormone and hormone inhibitor treatments in animal models have successfully been used to describe the role estrogens play in modulating Multiple Sclerosis [9, 64] , a phenomenon originally observed in pregnant women with the disease. We established a second parallel model in non-pregnant mice implanted with hormone pellets. The biodegradable pellets are implanted under the skin and release a steady stream of sex hormone for 21 days. While pregnancy is a complicated process with regularly fluctuating hormone levels, using this model, we are able to control a single variable and contrast these observations with analogous results in the pregnancy model. Using these two models, we found that high expression of estrogen appears to play a significant role during influenza infection. It appears to have protective effects by suppressing inflammatory responses [65] , and weight loss is reduced in the estrogenpelleted mice compared to placebo. However, estrogen also reduces CD8 T-cell cytotoxic activity both directly and as a result of less efficient APC activation. Since CD8 T cells function to kill virus-infected cells, this is likely to be responsible for the delayed viral clearance found during pregnancy. NK cell responses are also reduced during influenza infection, which likely contributes to the delay of adaptive immunity (Pazos et al. manuscript under review).",
