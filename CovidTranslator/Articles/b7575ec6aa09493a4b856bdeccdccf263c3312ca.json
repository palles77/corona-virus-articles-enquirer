In this study, the full-length sequences of two KAA isoforms, KAA-1 and KAA-2, were elucidated by a combination of peptide mapping and complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning. They consisted of four internal tandemrepeated domains, which are conserved in high-mannose specific lectins from lower organisms, including a cyanobacterium Oscillatoria agardhii and a red alga Eucheuma serra. Using an Escherichia coli expression system, an active recombinant form of KAA-1 (His-tagged rKAA-1) was successfully generated in the yield of 115 mg per liter of culture. In a detailed oligosaccharide binding analysis by a centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method with 27 pyridylaminated oligosaccharides, His-tagged rKAA-1 and rKAA-1 specifically bound to high-mannose N-glycans with an exposed \u03b11-3 mannose in the D2 arm as the native lectin did. Predicted from oligosaccharide binding specificity, a surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the recombinants exhibit strong interaction with gp120, a heavily glycosylated envelope glycoprotein of HIV with high association constants (1.48\u2212 1.61\u00d710 9 M \u22121 ). Native KAAs and the recombinants inhibited the HIV-1 entry at IC 50 s of low nanomolar levels (7.3-12.9 nM). Thus, the recombinant proteins would be useful as antiviral reagents targeting the viral surface glycoproteins with high-mannose N-glycans, and the cultivated alga K. alvarezii could also be a good source of not only carrageenans but also this functional lectin(s).",

These densely attached Nglycans shield the viral surface proteins to escape from neutralizing antibody recognition (Wei et al. 2003; Bonomelli et al. 2011 ). On the other hand, carbohydrate-binding agents that target those glycans on the viral envelope exhibit potent antiviral activities via interfering the interaction between gp120 and CD4 (Hansen et al. 1989; Balzarini et al. 1991; Charan et al. 2000; Dey et al. 2000; Swanson et al. 2010) .",

            "text": "Several high-mannose N-glycan-binding lectins are newly found and marked as potential microbicides having anti-HIV activities, such as cyanobacterial lectins of cyanovirin-N (CV-N) from Nostoc ellipsosoprum (Boyd et al. 1997) , scytovirin (SVN) from Scytonema varium (Bokesch et al. 2003) , and Microcystis viridis lectin (MVL) from Mycrosystis viridis (Bewley et al. 2004 ), a bacterial lectin of actinohivin (AH) from actinomycete Longispora albida (Chiba et al. 2001) , and algal lectins of griffithsin (GRFT) from a red alga Griffithsia sp. (Mori et al. 2005) , and Boodlea coacta agglutinin (BCA) from a green alga Boodlea coacta (Sato et al. 2011b ). These lectins show strong anti-HIV activities through their binding to mannoside structures on gp120. However, high-mannose recognition mode subtly differed among them, as well as the primary structure were clearly distinct (Sato et al. 2011b; Koharudin and Gronenborn 2014) . High-mannose N-glycan structures are also present on the surfaces of the other enveloped viruses such as influenza virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human herpes virus (HHV), West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Ebola virus (Okuno et al. 1992; Vigerust and Shepherd 2007) . This suggests that high-mannose binding lectins could also inactivate the entries of those viruses into host cells (Barrientos et al. 2003; Helle et al. 2006; O'Keefe et al. 2003 O'Keefe et al. , 2010 .",

Since then, several lectins with similar binding specificity were isolated from some lower organisms, including red algae (Kawakubo et al. 1999; Sato et al. 2011a; Hung et al. 2011 Hung et al. , 2015 , a cyanobacterium (Sato et al. 2000 , and bacteria (Cumsky and Zusman 1979; Sato et al. 2012; Koharudin et al. 2012; Whitley et al. 2013) . Interestingly, these lectins commonly had tandem-repeated structures of a similar domain composed of about 67 amino acids and grouped into two types of four and two repeats Sato et al. 2007; Sato and Hori 2009 ), as exemplified with ESA-2 (four repeats) and a lectin OAA (two repeats) from a freshwater cyanobacterium Oscillatoria agardhii. Thus, we demonstrated the occurrence of a new lectin family which is widely distributed in lower organisms, indicating that ESA-2 and OAA are orthologous to each other. Among them, OAA has been characterized in details. The structural analyses of OAA and its complexes with oligomannosides revealed that this lectin recognized a core unit, Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man\u03b2-of the branched mannoside in high-mannose N-glycan Gronenborn 2011, 2014) . This recognition mode of OAA was novel as the other highmannose binding lectins mostly recognized the nonreducing end mannoses. Potent anti-HIV activities of this lectin family, including ESA-2, OAA, Pseudomonas fluorescens agglutinin (PFA), Myxococcus xanthus agglutinin (myxobacterial hemagglutinin, MBHA) (Koharudin et al. 2012) , and Burkholderia oklahomensis agglutinin (BOA) (Whitley et al. 2013 ) were represented as expected by their specific binding nature to high-mannose sugar moiety. Strong anti-influenza virus activities through binding to the envelope hemagglutinin protein were also shown in PFL (identical to PFA) (Sato et al. 2012) , and KAA-2 isolated from a cultivated red alga Kappaphycus alvarezii (Sato et al. 2011a) .",

K. alvarezii cultivation was originally started in the Philippines in latter half of the 1960s using the local varieties selected from the wild (Doty 1973; Parker 1974; Bindu and Levine 2011) . After four decades, the Kappaphycus became the most widely cultivated commercial eucheumoid (Bindu and Levine 2011) and has globally been introduced for cultivation and some experimental purposes in tropical and subtropical area, including Asia, Africa, the Pacific Island, and American countries (Ask et al. 2003; Bindu and Levine 2011) . We recently reported that KAA-2 isolated from the cultivated sample of K. alvarezii preferentially recognized high-mannose-type oligosaccharides bearing an exposed \u03b11-3 Man at the nonreducing end in D2 arm and inhibited infection of various influenza virus strains with EC 50 s of low nanomolar levels through direct binding to the viral envelope hemagglutinin protein, which has several high-mannose N-glycans (Sato et al. 2011a) . The results also suggest that KAA-2 may belong to a new lectin family mentioned above. However, the primary structure of KAA is unknown yet as well as its anti-HIV activity.",

Twenty-five milligrams of His-rKAA-1 was then applied to thrombin treatment using a Thrombin Cleavage Capture Kit (Merck) to disconnect the tag peptide from the recombinant according to the manufacturer's instruction. After removal of thrombin by the above kit, the digested fraction was applied to His GraviTrap to exclude the cleaved His-tag peptide and undigested His-rKAA-1. Generated rKAA-1 was then dialyzed thoroughly against ultrapure water.",

This may be attributed to the difference of algal samples used for lectin isolation and cDNA cloning. Here, we defined the isolectin cDNA whose deduced amino acid sequence was closer to the predicted KAA-2 by peptide mapping as KAA-2 (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No. LC007081) and the other as KAA-1 (LC007080) (Fig. 5) . The predicted N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature KAAs was completely comparable in the sequence determined by Edman degradation for PE-KAA-2 (underlined sequence in Fig. 5a ), indicating that KAA cDNAs do not encode signal peptide and other propeptide regions. These two KAAs showed 89.7 and 98.5 % identities to each other in nucleotide and protein levels, respectively. Amino acid sequence identities between ESA-2 and KAA-1 or KAA-2 are 98.1 and 98.9 %, respectively. KAAs also contain 4 tandem repeats of around 67 amino acids (Fig. 6 ) as well as ESA-2 ).

They had no affinity for any monosaccharide examined, including mannose. A relatively strong binding to BSM and asialo-BSM with O-glycans was also observed for the recombinants and native KAAs. Thus, the hemagglutination-inhibition profiles of the recombinant KAAs were consistent with those of native KAAs, regardless of the presence or absence of the His-tag peptide in its N-terminus. In oligosaccharide binding experiments by a centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method with 27 PA-sugars (Figs. 8 and 9), His-rKAA-1 and rKAA-1 strongly bound to five oligosaccharides (oligosaccharides 7, 8, 10, 12, and 15) belonging to high-mannose-type N-glycans (oligosaccharides 7-17), but hardly to complex-type N-glycans (oligosaccharides 1-6), oligomannoses (oligosaccharides 18-22), core structures (oligosaccharides 23 and 24), or oligosaccharides from glycolipids (oligosaccharides 25-27) (Fig. 9 ). Comparing the binding activities between oligosaccharides 7 (80.8 % in His-rKAA-1) and 16 (17.1 %), 8 (100 %) and 11 (19.3 %), 10 (100 %) and 13 (20.7 %), 12 (95.6 %) and 14 (36.7 %), or 15 (100 %) and 9 (12.7 %) revealed that rKAAs recognized the nonreducing terminal \u03b1 1 -3 -l i n k e d M a n o f t h e D 2 a r m o f b r a n c h e d oligomannoside, and the nonreducing terminal \u03b11-2linked Man in the D2 arm negatively affects for binding of rKAAs.

Although the resonance unit of the sensorgram in His-rKAA-1 appeared slightly higher than those of the other KAAs, it might be caused by the molecular weight difference, because the molecular weight of His-rKAA-1 having N-terminal Histag peptide is approximately 2000 Da higher than those of the other KAAs.",

(1999) reported that the N-terminal amino acid sequences of KAAs were identical to those of ESAs, the whole primary structure of KAA-2 was considered to have a high similarity with that of ESA-2. Peptide mapping of KAA-2 using the sequence of ESA-2 as a template has elucidated 85 % (230/268 aa) of the full-length sequence. A calculated molecular mass of the predicted sequence by peptide mapping, including the corresponding sequences of ESA-2, was 28,022, which gave close agreement with that of PE-KAA-2 (28,124 including an Spyridylethyl group (105 Da) (Fig. 2a) ). Although cDNA cloning by RACE method elucidated the full-length cDNAs encoding KAAs, both of their deduced amino acid sequences were not identical to that of the native KAA-2 predicted by peptide mapping (Fig. 5b) . The calculated molecular mass from their sequences were 27,881.24 and 28, 007.41, respectively, and were also inconsistent with that of native KAA-2. We defined one of the two KAA cDNAs as KAA-2, whose amino acid sequence was more similar to native KAA-2 and ESA-2 and the other as KAA-1. The slight sequence differences between native KAA-2 and deduced KAA-2 might be individual variability in algal samples used. cDNA cloning has also elucidated that the transcripts of KAAs do not contain the region encoding a signal peptide sequence (Fig. 5) , which targets the proteins from the cytosol to the cytoplasmic membrane (prokaryotes) or to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (eukaryotes) (Imai and Nakai 2010) , as well as that of OAA from a cyanobacterium (Sato and Hori 2009 ). It has been reported that cDNAs encoding a lectin from Euonymus europaeus (EEA) and EUL protein from Arabidopsis thaliana (ArathEULS3) do not encode a signal peptide and these translated product located in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Van Hove et al. 2011) as well as a GNA ortholog from rice that lacks the signal peptide and propeptide sequence (Fouquaert et al. 2007 ). In addition, there are not any known cellular localization signals in the primary structure of KAAs (data not shown). It suggests that KAAs are also synthesized on free ribosomes and located in nucleocytoplasm. There is only a report as to the cellular localization of KAA orthologs; Nelson et al. (1981) reported that MBHA, a KAA ortholog from a myxobacterium, localizes at the specific sites on the surface of developmental cells but not vegetated cells and suggested their function in cellular interactions during aggregation. Detailed cellular localization of KAA should be elucidated and will help to predict their functions in the algal bodies.",

The nonreducing terminal \u03b11-2-linked Man in the D2 arm tended to more negatively affect for binding to rKAAs than native KAA-2. The recognition mode of KAAs is absolutely different from the other high-mannose specific antiviral lectins including CV-N, GRFT, SVN, MVL, and AH . We also reported the same oligosaccharide binding properties in ESA-2 ) and OAA ) and recently in KSA from K. striatum (Hung et al. 2011 ) and EDA from E. denticulatum (Hung et al. 2015) . A lectin PFL from Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 belonging to this lectin family also tends to preferentially recognize highmannose glycans with \u03b11-3 Man exposed in the D2 arm but not to other sugar types including complex N-glycans and Oglycans, as revealed by screening with a glycan array having 611 glycan targets (Sato et al. 2012) . Three-dimensional structural analyses for glycan-bound OAA , PFA (identical to PFL), MBHA (Koharudin et al. 2012) , and BOA (Whitley et al. 2013 ) supported their strict binding specificities; the amino acid residues which were revealed to interact with branched mannoside in the high-mannose glycans by tertiary structural analyses were absolutely conserved in all the lectins of this family as mentioned above (Fig. 6) . In previous (Sato et al. 2011a ) and present studies, native KAA-2 and rKAAs bound to high-mannose-type oligosaccharides but not or little to oligomannoses including PA-mannopentaose (Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man-PA) (oligosaccharide 22 in Fig. 8) , suggesting a possibility that the reducing terminal disaccharide GlcNAc-GlcNAc is necessary for KAAs to bind to high-mannose N-glycans. On the other hand, showed that OAA binds to this type of mannopentaose (not pyridylaminated), by NMR binding studies, and suggested that the reducing terminal disaccharide was not essential for OAA to bind to those glycans. Exactly, PA-oligosaccharides used in this study possessed the reducing terminal residues with ring-opening structures by Fig. 8) . Thus, it might be attributable to such ring-opening of the reducing terminal residues that KAAs did not bind to the PA-oligomannoses, including mannopentaose (Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man-PA) (oligosaccharide 22 in Figs. 8 and 9 ). Although we have not elucidated the structure of a KAAmannopentaose complex, it is strongly predicted that KAA, as well as OAA , requires the reducing terminal mannose having the ring structure for binding to mannopentaose, unlike CV-N and GRFT that do not directly interact with the reducing terminal mannose . SPR analyses revealed that rKAAs bound to HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 with high association constants (1.48-1.61 \u00d7 10 9 M \u2212 1 ) as well as native KAAs did (Fig. 10) . gp120 is extensively glycosylated with N-linked complex and high-mannose carbohydrates accounting for about half of its molecular weight (Geyer et al. 1988 ), suggesting that KAAs can bind gp120 with a high affinity for the high-mannose sugars. Supposed from their strong binding to the gp120, KAAs represented potent anti-HIV activities at IC 50 of nanomolar levels (7.3-12.9 nM, Table 4 ) in virus neutralization assay with Jurkat cells. The activities were comparable to those of OAA (12 nM of IC 50 against HIV-1 (R9) in TZM-b1 cells (Koharudin et al. 2012) ; 45 nM of EC 50 against HIV-1 X4 in MT-4 cells )), MBHA (15 nM of IC 50 against HIV-1 (R9) in TZM-b1 cells (Koharudin et al. 2012 )), BOA (12.2 nM of IC 50 against HIV-1 (R9) in TZM-b1 cells (Whitley et al. 2013 )), and ESA-2 (165 nM of EC 50 against HIV-1 X4 in MT-4 cells ). There are a lot of HIV-1 strains, being suggested that there may be distinct sugar structures on their envelope gp120 (Zhang et al. 2004) . The difference of anti-HIV activities, such as the activities of OAA against HIV-1 (R9) in TZM-b1 and HIV-1 X4 in MT-4 cells, may be caused by the difference of virus strains and cells (Huskens and Schols 2012) used in the experiments. The anti-HIV activities of CV-N and GRFT were reported as 0.4 nM (against HIV-1 (R9) in TZM-b1 cells) and 0.04 nM (against HIV-1 X4 in MT-4 cells) of IC 50 (or EC 50 ), respectively (Koharudin et al. 2012; Mori et al. 2005) . The interaction between GRFT and HIV-1 gp120 IIIB (X4) was also elucidated by Xue et al. (2013) via a SPR analysis using a BIAcore T200; the dissociation constant of GRFT with the gp120 is 6.93\u00d710 \u221211 M, which is tenfold lower than those of KAAs (6.22-6.77\u00d710 \u221210 M) (Fig. 10) . These relatively strong anti-HIV-1 activities of CV-N and GRFT and the robust interaction of GRFT with gp120 come from the multivalency of binding sites on the lectins and that of epitopes on the high-mannose oligosaccharides . Although the antiviral activities of KAAs are lower than those of CV-N and GRFT, the oligomannose epitopes recognized by KAAs are different from those recognized by CV-N and GRFT. Since high mutation rate in HIV-1 can rapidly produce the resistant viruses against these antiviral lectins (Witvrouw et al. 2005; Huang et al. 2011 ), multilateral and synergistic use of the antiviral lectins whose recognition epitopes in oligosaccharides are different from one another can be effective as F\u00e9rir et al. (2014) represented. We searched higher plant lectins similar to KAAs by in silico screening for genome sequences of soybean Glycine max, rice Oryza sativa, and Arabidopsis; however, higher plant genomes encode no lectins similar to this lectin family (data not shown) as Jiang et al. (2010) reported a genomewide screening of higher plant lectins. This lectin family is found to date only in lower organisms including eukaryotes of red algae and prokaryotes of cyanobacteria and bacteria. The biofunctional mechanism(s) where this lectin family preferentially binds to high-mannose carbohydrates having an exposed His-rKAA-1 rKAA-1 b a Fig. 9 Interaction analysis between rKAAs and various oligosaccharides by a centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method. a Binding activities of rKAAs to PA-oligosaccharides. Binding activity was expressed as a ratio (%) of the amount of a bound oligosaccharide to that of an added oligosaccharide. The assay was performed in duplicate for each PA-oligosaccharide, and the activity is expressed as the average value from duplicate assays. The activities less than 10 % were cutoff for their insignificance. b The detailed binding activities of rKAAs with high-mannose-type N-glycans. Dashed boxes represent the nonreducing terminal \u03b11-2-linked mannose residue in the D2 arm \u03b11-3 Man in the D2 arm of branched oligomannoside is still uncovered. As Yoshiie et al. (2012) reported that the N-glycans of glycoproteins in red algae are predominantly highmannose types, the internal ligands of KAAs could exist in the cells, implied from the predicted nucleocytoplasmic localization of the lectins as described before. However, the lectins peculiar to these lower organisms may have common function(s), such as host defense against infections of invasive viruses, bacteria, or fungi to these organisms as well as several cytoplasmic/nuclear plant lectins, including amaranthins, Euonymus lectin-like (EUL)-related lectins, jacalin-related lectins, and nictaba-related lectins, have an important role in plant defense against pathogens Van Damme 2010, 2014; Dias Rde et al. 2015; De Schutter and Van Damme 2015) .",

These results suggested that KAAs have potentiality to represent broad antiviral activities against viruses possessing highmannose glycans on their envelope such as HCV, HHV, SARS-CoV, and Ebola virus, as well as native KAA-2 did against influenza viruses (Sato et al. 2011a) . It is important that antiviral lectins are isolated from a globally cultivated edible algal species in contrast that any other homologous anti-HIV lectins are derived from bacteria (BOA, PFL, MBHA), a cyanobacterium (OAA), and an uncultivated alga (ESA-2); KAAs can be purified in a relatively high yield of 270 mg per 100 g of freeze-dried alga (Kawakubo et al. 1999 ). These functional lectins will become a strong tool by being supplied in bulk as both native and recombinant forms, which are almost identical in their carbohydrate specificities and antiviral activities.",

SPR analyses for interaction between gp120 and His-rKAA-1 (a) or rKAA-1 (b) were analyzed with BIAcore2000. Each sensorgram represents the binding activity of rKAAs to gp120 on sensor chip. Ninety microliters of rKAA solutions of each represented concentration was injected into the flow cells at 30 \u03bcl/min for 3 min. The binding response (black line) in resonance units is plotted against time (seconds). Binding kinetics of the interactions between rKAAs and gp120 (overlaid red line) were calculated by fitting the data to Langmuir model for 1:1 binding. c Comparison of binding activity to gp120 among KAAs including His-rKAA-1, rKAA-1, KAA-1, and KAA-2. SPR analysis was performed using 0.98 nM of each lectin solution by the same method as described above Table 3 Summary of binding kinetics of the interactions between rKAAs and gp120",
