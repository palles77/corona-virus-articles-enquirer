            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection causes meningoencephalitis by disrupting the neuro-glial and glial-pial homeostasis. Recent studies suggest that MHV infection alters gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43)-mediated intercellular communication in brain and primary cultured astrocytes. In addition to astrocytes, meningeal fibroblasts also express high levels of Cx43. Fibroblasts in the meninges together with the basal lamina and the astrocyte endfeet forms the glial limitans superficialis as part of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Alteration of glial-pial gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) in MHV infection has the potential to affect the integrity of BBB. Till date, it is not known if viral infection can modulate Cx43 expression and function in cells of the brain meninges and thus affect BBB permeability. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of MHV infection on Cx43 localization and function in mouse brain meningeal cells and primary meningeal fibroblasts. Our results show that MHV infection reduces total Cx43 levels and causes its intracellular retention in the perinuclear compartments reducing its surface expression. Reduced trafficking of Cx43 to the cell surface in MHV-infected cells is associated with loss functional GJIC. Together, these data suggest that MHV infection can directly affect expression and cellular distribution of Cx43 resulting in loss of Cx43-mediated GJIC in meningeal fibroblasts, which may be associated with altered BBB function observed in acute infection.",

            "text": "The meninges are formed by three tissue membranes that primarily provide protective covering to the central nervous system (CNS). They comprise of the outer dura matter, middle arachnoid matter, and inner pia matter that consist of different cell populations including the fibroblasts, mast cells, endodermal cells, and smooth muscle cells [1] . The arachnoid and the pia matter, together called as leptomeninges, harbor a large population of fibroblasts [2] . Meningeal fibroblasts are known to have important role in blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation, glial scar formation during injury response, angiogenesis, and early astrocyte activation [3, 4] . In adult CNS, the meninges cover and penetrate the neural tissue deeply at every level of its organization: as large projections between the major brain structures, as stroma of the choroid plexus, and as sheaths of blood vessels forming the perivascular space. They also form the roof of the lateral ventricles, the third and the fourth ventricles. Their widespread distribution and complex organization suggest a more important role of the meninges as modulator of brain function in addition to being a mere protective covering of the brain. A further indication that the meninges are functionally linked to the neural tissue is the presence of gap junction proteins called connexins (Cxs).",

GJs are composed of two hemichannels each contributed by the two opposing cells. The hemichannels or connexons are formed by six Cx protein subunits which after synthesis and oligomerization in endoplasmic reticulum/endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate complex are trafficked to the cell surface where they are mostly assembled into gap junction plaques. Cx proteins, mainly Cx43, Cx30, and Cx26, have been found in the meninges and in their projections into the brain, including meningeal sheaths of blood vessels and stroma of the choroid plexus [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The distribution of these proteins suggests the existence of anatomical and functional interactions between meningeal cells, meningeal perivascular cells, ependymocytes, and astrocytes, thus providing a rapid means to spread signals in physiological and pathological events.",

Recent findings suggest that Cx43-mediated functional coupling between the astrocytes and in the panglial system is altered in various neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemia, and multiple sclerosis (MS) [14] [15] [16] [17] . Additionally, neuroinfections caused by Borna virus, bovine papillomavirus, Rous sarcoma virus, and human influenza virus can alter Cx-mediated gap junction communication [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Our previous studies have demonstrated that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection significantly reduces Cx43 expression and functional gap junction formation in mice brain and in cultured astrocytes [23] . MHV-A59, a neurotropic strain of the coronavirus, causes meningitis and encephalitis in acute infection followed by demyelination and concurrent axonal loss in chronic stage of infection, serving as a model to study certain pathology of virusinduced meningitis and the human CNS-demyelinating disease MS [24, 25] . Although earlier reports suggest that MHV infection causes loss of Cx43 expression and negatively affects gap junction communication in the brain, particularly in astrocytes, at present, very little is known about virus-induced alterations of Cx channels in meningeal fibroblasts. This is particularly important in injuryinduced brain parenchymal reaction, where GJs in the astrocyte-fibroblast interface play an important role in reforming glial limitans that forms a part of the BBB. Moreover, Cx proteins of BBB have been shown to regulate BBB permeability in inflammatory conditions [26] . In the present study, we investigated the expression and cellular distribution of Cx43 in MHV-A59-infected mouse brain meningeal cells. In parallel, we have established an in vitro model of viral meningitis by infecting fibroblast-enriched primary meningeal cultures with MHV to understand the effect of viral infection on Cx43-mediated gap junction communication in meningeal fibroblasts. Our findings provide important insights in understanding the role of glial-pial GJIC in altered barrier function of the inflamed brain.",

Briefly, sections were incubated with 1 M glycine in PBS for 1 h at room temperature (RT) to reduce non-specific cross-linking and subsequently treated with 1 mg/ml NaBH 4 in PBS for 10 min at RT to reduce autofluorescence. Sections were washed in PBS and incubated with blocking serum containing PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 2% normal goat serum. Sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with anti-Cx43 in combination with either anti-vimentin or anti-viral nucleocapsid (N) antisera prepared in blocking serum at dilutions listed in Table 1 . The following day, the sections were washed and incubated in appropriate FITC or Texas Red conjugated fluorescent secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., PA, USA) for 1 h at RT. All incubations were done in humid chambers. Slides were washed and mounted in Vectashield\u00ae mounting media containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, CA, USA). Sections were visualized and imaged using a Zeiss\u00ae confocal microscope (LSM710; Carl Zeiss AG, Germany).",

Paraffinembedded brain sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to visualize inflammation in different brain regions (Fig. 1a-f ). The mock-infected mouse brain sections showed no signs of inflammation and exhibited intact meningeal layer lining the cortex and choroid plexus in the ventricular spaces ( Fig. 1a-e) . In contrast, acute meningitis and inflammatory tissue damage was evident in the corresponding brain regions from MHV-A59-infected mice (Fig. 1b-f ). Previous studies suggested that the meningeal cells express high levels of Cx43 and are tightly coupled by gap junctions both in developing and adult brain [13] . Moreover, Cxmediated gap junction communications are known to be affected in several CNS-associated injuries and pathologies. Therefore, to investigate the effect of viral infection on Cx43 expression and distribution in the infected meningeal cells of MHV-A59-infected mouse brains, we performed doubleimmunolabeling with a combination of anti-Cx43 and antiviral nucleocapsid (N; Fig. 2a-l) or anti-vimentin antibody (Fig. 3a-l) . Our results clearly showed that MHV-A59 infection altered the expression pattern of Cx43 in infected meningeal cells. Interestingly, we observed a marked downregulation in the overall Cx43 staining in infected and vimentinpositive cells of the meninges (Fig. 2a-f, Fig. 3a-f ), choroid plexus ( Fig. 2g-l) , and perivascular region (Fig. 3g-l) in infected brains compared to controls. Additionally, while the control brain sections showed a characteristic punctate distribution of Cx43 (Fig. 2b, h) , the infected and vimentin-positive meningeal fibroblasts in the infected mouse brains showed loss of its characteristic punctate staining (Fig. 2e, k) .",

Purity of the primary cultures was first determined by flow cytometry, using vimentin as fibroblast marker [1] and GFAP as astrocyte marker (Fig. 4a) . Viable cell population (P1) was normalized for each marker expression with isotype controls. As expected, majority of the cells (92.4%) in our established cultures were vimentin-positive meningeal fibroblasts. In addition, a small population (0.04%) of the cells were found to be GFAP-positive, and a few (1.83%) were positive for both GFAP and vimentin and probably represents stem/progenitor cells with a potential to differentiate to either astrocytes or fibroblasts at a later stage in culture. Supporting this, our double-immunostaining of primary meningeal cultures with anti-GFAP and antivimentin antibodies also showed that most of the cells in cultures expressed vimentin only (Fig. 4b, arrows) . However, a few GFAP-positive and GFAP and vimentin dual positive cells were also observed. Visual counting of the cells from three independent cultures (with 30 different fields from each set) demonstrated that about 74.83% cells were positive for vimentin only, while 4.6% cells expressed GFAP only and 11.7% stained for both markers (Fig. 4c) . Additionally, we also quantified the vimentin expression in our primary meningeal cultures. Our immunoblotting experiments clearly showed that the primary meningeal cultures expressed a significantly higher level of the fibroblast marker vimentin compared to mixed glial cultures demonstrating the enrichment for meningeal fibroblasts in the primary cultures (Fig. 4d) .",

In the mock-infected meningeal fibroblast cultures, vimentin positive cells expressed profuse Cx43 at the cell surface, demonstrated by its characteristic punctate staining (Fig. 5a -c, g-i; arrow and inset).

Moreover, our immunofluorescence studies also suggest a possible reduction in total Cx43 levels in vimentinlabeled cells of virus-infected mouse brains and altered cellular distribution in primary meningeal fibroblasts. To quantify the observed change, we measured total Cx43 levels in primary meningeal cultures infected with MHV-A59. Cx43 levels were found to be significantly downregulated in the infected cultures compared to control (\u2212 50.50 \u00b1 10.77%; p < 0.01) ( Fig. 7a; lower panel) . To determine if reduced Cx43 expression together with its increased intracellular retention affected functional gap junction communication in infected meningeal cells, we performed LY dye transfer in a scrape-loading assay. Cx43 channels are permeable to LY, a small molecular dye that moves from cells to the neighboring cells via gap junctions [34] . Primary meningeal fibroblasts were either mockinfected or infected with MHV-A59 and gap junction activity was assayed by scrape-loading dye transfer 24 h p.i. MHV-A59 infection prevented cultured meningeal fibroblasts from transferring the dye to neighboring cells, as the distance of dye spread beyond the injured cells at the scratch boundary was significantly less compared to the control cultures (Fig.7b) . Control meningeal fibroblasts exhibited active gap junction communication, while infected fibroblasts displayed less gap junction communication, as evident from shorter dye travel distance (control: 287.5 \u00b1 24.35 \u03bcm vs. infected: 139.8 \u00b1 5.19 \u03bcm; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 7b; lower panel) .",

Interestingly, Triton X-100 solubilization resulted in a marked decrease in Cx43 staining in mock- infected cultures compared to non-Triton X-100-treated experimental controls (Fig. 8a-f ). This might be because intracellular soluble monomers of Cx43 were extracted by Triton X-100 treatment leaving behind the Cx43 puncta that were assembled in gap junction plaques and resistant to Triton X-100 solubilization. In contrast, MHV-infected meningeal fibroblasts showed mostly intracellular accumulation of Cx43 in the perinuclear region (Fig. 8g-l; arrows in h, i, k, and l).

It is reported that meningeal cells can communicate with astrocytes via Ca 2+ signaling [43] . Interestingly, ablation of astrocytic Cx30 has been shown to cause nearly complete depletion of Cx26 immunoreactivity in leptomeninges [11] . Moreover, the meninges are important in maintaining the functional coupling among the glia limitans astrocytes, which are more coupled than the astrocytes in the molecular layer [44] . During injuryinduced parenchymal reaction, reactive astrocytes and the meningeal cells form a glia-fibroblast interface that forms new basal lamina which along with astrocytic endfeet reforms the glial limitans [45, 46] . This process is crucial for restoring the BBB function and re-establishing CNS homeostasis. Thus, Cx channels play an important role in maintaining BBB function, and loss of these junctional communications might affect BBB permeability. The effect of Cx43 on BBB may be mediated via tight junction proteins such as claudin, occludin, and zona occludens (ZO-1). There are reports of Cx43 interacting with tight junction protein ZO-1 through its carboxyl terminus [47] . The PDZ domain of ZO-1 serves to recruit several signaling molecules and also provides anchorage to several cytoskeletal elements. Moreover, the dynamic association of ZO-1 with Cx43 also modulates the stability of gap junction channel and regulates its internalization and endosomal turnover [48] . ZO-1 and other tight junction proteins are reported to be downregulated in BBB leakage during different pathological conditions [49] . Hence, the virus-induced retention of Cx43 might alter the stability of membrane resident tight junction proteins and disrupt the BBB integrity.",

Experimental intracranial inoculation with MHV might increase BBB permeability, leading to rapid viral dissemination and enhanced transmigration of activated immune cells into the brain. Although the homing mechanism of immune cells and molecular mechanisms of BBB disruption in MHV infection are not well understood, viral infection-associated loss of Cx-mediated intercellular communication might play an important role in altered BBB permeability and altered CNS homeostasis during neuroinflammation.",
