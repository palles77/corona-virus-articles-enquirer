After a further washing step, a 1 :1000 dilution of peroxidase labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to each well . The plates were then incubated for 90 min at 37\u00b0C, washed, and placed for 30-40 min at room temperature after addition of the enzyme-substrate solution (1 gg ml -1 of 5-aminosalicilic acid (Sigma)) and 0005% hydrogen peroxide, pH 6 . 0 . The abs6rbance was measured at 474 nm using a multichannel photometer (Titerteck Multiskan, Flow) . A positive/negative ratio was determined as follows : Positive/negative=(A{sample}-A{blank}/A{nega-tive} -{blank}), where A{sample} and A{blank} are A474 values of clinical specimens tested and a Tris-buffered saline solution control, respectively, and A{nega-tive} is the mean A474 value of the supernatant fluid of uninfected HRT-18 cellcultures. A clinical sample was considered positive when the positive/negative ratio was _>-3 . This high cut-off value was chosen since variation in clinical specimens was observed to be higher than those from tissue culture .",

In a test model, equal quantities of several purified-virus dilutions and of the individually processed samples were spotted directly onto the nitrocellulose membrane for analysis by hybridization, using the probe-pool of six probes . The detection signals from these samples, and from dilutions of purified virus, concentrated on a cushion of sucrose, are shown in Fig. 2 . Although some virus loss was obtained during all processing procedures, when detection signals are compared with those obtained after spotting purified virus dilutions (Fig . 2, lane 1) , almost no detection signals were seen after phenol/chloroform extractions (Fig . 2, lane 3) , most probably due to uncoating of the RNA and the presence of RNases .

The relatively low values obtained by ELISA, performed on the original specimens may be due to the presence of proteases, virus-specific secretory immunoglobulins, or other interfering factors .\" On the other hand, the increase of positive ELISA readings after Airfuge-centrifugation of samples, which were negative for virus by hybridization or tissue culture, indicated the presence and concentration of macromolecules able to yield falsepositive reactions . Freon treatment decreased the overall number of positives, presumably due to disruption of the viral envelope . Previous studies 36,3 ' have shown that vector homology in diagnostic nucleic acid hybridization may cause problems, however, no significant background signal contribution was observed in our experiments (Fig . 3, lane la, 2a, 3a) . Nevertheless, control hybridizations were always included as a precaution to circumvent possible misinterpretations . Direct spotting of diluted and clarified faecal samples, by means of a slot-blot apparatus was often difficult as debris blocked the wells of the apparatus thus preventing sufficient virus binding . Furthermore, interpretation of the detection signals obtained after direct spotting was difficult due to blurred detection spots (Fig . 3, lane 3) , which were most likely a result of non-specific probe-trapping by spotted clinical specimens, and may be responsible for the false-positive result of sample 27 and 31 . One of the 34 samples analysed (# 12) was identified as true positive, but virus could not be detected after culturing on cell monolayers, indicating the presence of either inactivated virus or a different virus strain, that was not capable of adapting to HRT-18 cells . One of the specimens (# 13) was positive by hybridization after passage in cell culture twice, but negative by ELISA, suggesting the isolation of a different BCV serotype .",

The ability of a test to recognize correctly specimens from infected and non-infected animals ('accuracy') was defined as Dl(+,-) by the equation DI(+,-)= Dl(+) X prevalence+ Dl(-) X (1-prevalence) . Generally, prevalence is defined as the number of true positives JP) plus false negatives (FN) among all test results ((TP+TN)/n) . Here, specimens were considered to have a positive status (PS =TP+ FN) when they were yielding either (i) a positive result with both virus detection by hybridization on original or processed samples and ELISA performed on the original specimens, or (ii) a positive hybridization result after second passage of the sample on HRT-18 cell monolayers . For a given detection method, the reliability of a positive test result (RT(+)) was defined as the ratio of true positives over the total number of positive test results . The reliability of a negative test result (RT(-)) was defined as the ratio of true negatives over the total numbers of negative test results . Sensitivity is here defined as the slope of the doseresponse curve (dR/dC) and the detectability as the minimum amount of virus that can be detected .",
