Among these recent mutations, we identify amino acid substitutions common to the SARS 2003 outbreak isolates in positions 427N and 436Y, indicating potential adaptive convergent evolution. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that appears to interact with the human ACE2 receptor. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the 2019-nCoV virus whereby the 2019-nCoV ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS by incorporation of a SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, those recombinants underwent convergent evolution.",

Previous genome-wide analyses in coronaviruses (CoV) have estimated that their evolutionary rates are of the same order of magnitude as in other fast-evolving RNA viruses 7, 8 . Interestingly, evolution within the CoV Spike gene, whose encoded protein interacts with the host cell receptor and is a key determinant in host tropism, appears to occur faster than in most of the other CoV genes 8 . Recombination in RNA viruses, known to be frequent in coronaviruses, can lead to the acquisition of genetic material from other viral strains 9 . Indeed, recombination has been proposed to play a major role in the generation of new coronavirus lineages such as SARS-CoV 9 . Interestingly, a recent study suggests that 2019-nCoV was involved in a potential recombination event between different members of the Sarbecovirus subgenus 1 .",

These results do not only demonstrate that 2019-nCoV displays a genotype similar to human SARS in the RBD, but also that it seems to have originated through recombination. To trace back the potential time of this recombination event, we used a Bayesian Phylogenetic approach 13 in the recombinant region (codons 200-500 in the Spike gene) and compared with the whole genome phylogeny ( Figure 3b ). As in the full genome phylogeny, Wuhan 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 were in the same clade, with human SARS-CoV as an outgroup. From our, results we propose two different scenarios. The first is that Wuhan 2019-nCoV derives from a recombination event between human SARS-CoV and another (unsampled) SARS-like",

The analysis was performed with the GTR+ GAMMA (4 cat) substitution model combined with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model and the Bayesian Skyline Plot demographic model. We used as prior distribution for the time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) a normal distribution with mean 40 years (standard deviation 10 years), as previously inferred 7 . Two independent runs of BEAST were performed, with MCMC chain lengths of 5x10 7 states. Convergence of the estimated parameters was confirmed with Tracer http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/.",

For statistical significance, we chose 5% BY FDR. Our discoveries hold with different choices for window length, provided the window size is sensitive to the scale of interest (namely CoV proteins and the length of specific domains such as the RBD in the Spike).",

This effect was not observed when restricting the analysis to human MERS samples only (n=170) possibly due to the lower number and diversity of sequences available (Supplementary Figure 4). We thus show that the enrichment of recombination events involving the Spike gene is also observed at a viral species level. Recombination event in an ancestor of 2019-nCoV encompassing the RBD of the Spike gene We then asked if this enrichment of recombination could be found in the recent history of 2019-nCoV. We first perform sliding phylogenetics showing topological incongruences between phylogenies involving three sections of the Spike gene: the 5', the RBD and the 3' (Figure 3a), supporting potential recombination within the Spike gene involving the RBD domain. In addition, recombination analysis performed with the RDP4 package detected a significant recombination event (genome positions 22614-23032) affecting 2019-nCoV and the human SARS in the RBD (p-val. < 0.003, RDP, Bootscan, Maxchi and Chimaera), recapitulating the result of Wu et al. 1 Interestingly, the clade of the full genome phylogeny",

The second mutation that we identified, K427N, may disrupt the short helix and cause the loop to shift, further affecting stability (Supplementary Figure 9). These two positions, 436Y and 427N, which are present in all isolates from the 2009-nCoV viruses, are also found in viruses from other hosts, including civets (Paguma larvata) (Supplementary Table 5).
