The KSHV replication and transcription activator (RTA) and latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) play key roles in activating KSHV lytic replication and maintaining KSHV latency, respectively. Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) are similar to short single-stranded DNA oligomers, but possess a modified backbone that confers highly specific binding and resistance to nucleases. In this study, RTA and LANA mRNA in PEL cells were targeted by antisense peptide-conjugated PMO (P-PMO) in an effort to suppress KSHV replication. Highly efficient P-PMO uptake by PEL cells was observed. Treatment of PEL cells with a RTA P-PMO (RP1) reduced RTA expression in a dose-dependent and sequence-specific manner, and also caused a significant decrease in several KSHV early and late gene products, including vIL-6, vIRF-1, and ORF-K8.1A. KSHV viral DNA levels were reduced both in cells and culture supernatants of RP1 P-PMO-treated cells, indicating that KSHV lytic replication was suppressed. Treatment of BCBL-1 cells with P-PMO against LANA resulted in a reduction of LANA expression. Cell viability assays detected no cytotoxicity from P-PMO alone, within the concentration range used for the experiments in this study. These results suggest that RP1 P-PMO can specifically block KSHV replication, and further study is warranted.",

            "text": "Nucleic acid-based strategies used to block gene expression include RNA decoys and antisense compounds. RNA decoys are oligoribonucleotides that compete for a translational activator or mRNA-stabilizing elements, and cause translation inhibition or mRNA destruction (Beelman and Parker, 1995; Liebhaber, 1997) . Antisense strategies employ various structural types of RNA-or DNA-based oligomers, ribozymes or DNAzymes, and small-interfering RNAs (siRNA). All of these approaches are based on Watson-Crick base-pairing of antisense agent to com-plementary sequence in the mRNA selected for targeting. To be useful in vivo these strategies will likely need to utilize modified nucleic acid backbone structures to provide protection from host nucleases. Additionally, a candidate therapeutic must be able to effectively enter cells of relevant tissues and access target RNA. PMO are structurally similar to singlestranded DNA oligonucleotides, but have a different backbone; a morpholine ring replaces the deoxyribose sugar, and a phosphorodiamidate linkage replaces the phosphodiester linkage of DNA ( Fig. 1) (Schmajuk et al., 1999; Summerton, 1999) . PMOs are uncharged, water-soluble, highly resistant to nuclease degradation (Hudziak et al., 2000) , and are typically synthesized to be approximately 20 bases in length. PMO can bind to target mRNA and prevent translation initiation by steric blockade, which is distinct from the RNase H-dependent mechanism of action induced by antisense structural types based on DNA chemistry (Summerton, 1999) . Additionally, PMO conjugated to (Russo et al., 1996) . The sizes of the latent transcripts are indicated above each line. The predicted splicing events of both IE (Sun et al., 1998) and latent transcripts (Dittmer et al., 1998; Talbot et al., 1999) are schematically illustrated. small, positively charged peptides have far greater delivery efficiency to cells in culture than non-conjugated PMO (Moulton et al., 2003 .",

KSHV is also associated with several lymphoproliferative disorders, including primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) (Cesarman et al., 1995a; Chang et al., 1994; Soulier et al., 1995) . Like other herpesviruses, KSHV causes two modes of infection: latent and lytic. In latency, the KSHV genome persists with limited gene expression in host cells (Fakhari and Dittmer, 2002; Sarid et al., 1998) . LANA, encoded by ORF73, has a major role in the maintenance of KSHV latency (Ballestas et al., 1999; Lan et al., 2004; Lim et al., 2002 Lim et al., , 2004 Shinohara et al., 2002) . LANA interacts with p53 and represses its transcriptional activity (Friborg et al., 1999) , targets retinoblastoma-E2F transcriptional regulatory pathway, and transforms primary rat cells in cooperation with the oncogene Hras (Radkov et al., 2000) . LANA also up-regulates the telomerase promoter and modulates host cellular gene expression Renne et al., 2001) . Mutagenic disruption of ORF73 can lead to abortive KSHV episome persistence (Ye et al., 2004) . When KSHV latency is disrupted the virus switches to a lytic phase in which infectious virions are produced, and then spread from cell to cell. The lytic reactivation of virus replication in PEL cells can be induced by various chemicals, such as the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) and sodium butyrate (Renne et al., 1996) . KSHV lytic replication can be divided into immediate-early, early and late stages. A key immediate-early gene, ORF50 encodes RTA, and this protein activates viral lytic gene expression (Sun et al., 1998) .",

Proinflammatory cytokines are considered to be essential for the development of KSHV-associated malignancies (Ensoli et al., 1991; Moore et al., 1996) . In KSHV-infected PEL cells and in KS lesions, a low percentage (<5%) of cells maintain KSHV lytic replication (Miller et al., 1997) . Lytic cycle activation is a pivotal event in the cascade of events involved with KSHV replication. RTA is essential as a controlling factor of viral replication during the lytic phase, and contributes to the development of KSHV-associated diseases. In this report, we demonstrate highly efficient uptake of P-PMO by KSHVinfected BCBL-1 cells, as well as highly effective sequencespecific inhibition of RTA and LANA protein expression. Viral genes characteristically expressed downstream of RTA were also suppressed as a result of specific P-PMO-mediated inhibition.",

In this study, R 5 F 2 R 4 -PMO were tested for cellular uptake and persistence in BCBL-1 cells. The presence of P-PMO-F1 in treated BCBL-1 cells indicated that R 5 F 2 R 4 assisted in PMO uptake; as the corresponding PMO-F1 failed in the uptake assay. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that P-PMO-F1 entered over 95% of the cells. Furthermore, The P-PMO-F1 persisted for one week after a single application. The uptake assays were conducted in the absence of serum in the cell culture media. The R 5 F 2 R 4 -PMO used in this study achieve relatively poor cellular uptake when applied in the presence of serum. There have been recent reports, however, of a peptide-PMO conjugate (RXR) 4 XB-PMO, which is capable of effective delivery into cells in the presence of serum (Deas et al., 2005; Nelson et al., 2005) .

There remained faint RTA protein expression in BCBL-1 cells treated with 16 M RP1, which suggests that some cells achieved little or no uptake of P-PMO or that an insufficient quantity of P-PMO made its way into the subcellular locations where RTA mRNA is translated.

These results demonstrate that KSHV lytic replication was abrogated in BCBL-1 cells after RTA P-PMO application. This pattern of RTA preeminence in the events of lytic progression is consistent with previous publications (Curreli et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2004) . Curreli et al. (2002) showed that methotrexate, a potent antiinflammatory agent and an inhibitor of cellular dihydrofolate reductase, reduces the expression of ORF50/RTA and prevents expression of other lytic genes. The mechanism of this action is not known. Zhu et al. showed that a DNA-based external guidance sequence (EGS) that targets RTA mRNA for RNase P-based cleavage was found to be an effective means to suppress KSHV lytic replication in BCBL-1 cells, despite its limited transfection efficiency (Zhu et al., 2004) .

The efficacy of LP3 suggests that it was able to inhibit the 5 UTR splicing event of the 5.7 Kb latent transcript (Fig. 1) , leading to a reduction of 5.4 Kb transcript encoding LANA. Because the latent transcript encoding ORF72/vCyclin and ORF71/vFLIP is spliced from the same latent transcript as LANA (Dittmer et al., 1998; Talbot et al., 1999) , LP2 and LP3 P-PMO may have the potential to inhibit the translation of these latent transcripts as well.",

We speculate that this target sequence region of the latent LANA transcript may be inaccessible to P-PMO in cells, as the same P-PMO was effective in an in vitro translation reporter assay. RNA secondary structure analysis of the latent transcript using an mfold program (Zuker, 2003) revealed that complex secondary structures likely exist in this translational initiation region (data not shown).",

Cidofovir and foscarnet have no effect on expression of latent or early lytic genes (Curreli et al., 2002) , as these drugs are inhibitors of the viral DNA polymerase, and transcription of early lytic genes occurs before DNA replication in KSHV. LANA, RTA, and early lytic genes such as vIL-6 Jones et al., 1999; Staskus et al., 1999) and vIRF-1 Zimring et al., 1998) play important roles in KSHV replication and pathogenesis. Blocking expression of these genes, and thereby that of down-stream genes as well, could contribute to the treatment of KSHV-associated malignancies. Antisense P-PMO compounds targeting RTA and LANA may prove to be effective reagents to impede KSHV replication in vivo, and warrant further study.",
