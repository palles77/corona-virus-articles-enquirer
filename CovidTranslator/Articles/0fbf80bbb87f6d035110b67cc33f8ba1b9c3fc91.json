This constellation of symptoms is known as \"sickness behavior\" and is thought to reflect an adaptive, acute phase state in which the body mounts an organized biological response to defend against a pathogenic threat (9 , 11 , 12) . Sickness behaviors, in turn, can increase inflammatory responses in the body (6) , ultimately forming a vicious inflammation-sickness cycle. Although sickness behavior is believed to be an adaptive response to infectious agents, it may be detrimental in cancer patients when activation of the peripheral immune system and/or emotional distress continues unabated and exacerbates the inflammation-sickness cycle, ultimately taxing the person's resources (13) . Sickness behavior in animal models parallels symptom expression in cancer patients, including physical symptoms such as pain, nausea, wasting/cachexia, and fatigue (11) . Inflammation and symptoms associated with sickness behavior can have profound effects on patients' lives; interrupting this cycle could improve the quality of life and, potentially, the survival of breast cancer patients (14 -17) .",

Put another way, higher levels of emotional acceptance will moderate the association between inflammation and sickness symptoms in breast cancer patients.",

Thus, for each woman, we calculated her mean level of cytokines and emotional acceptance by averaging her values for that variable across all of her time points. We also calculated person-centered values of each woman's cytokines and emotional acceptance by subtracting her mean value for that variable from each of her individual observations (at each time point) for that variable.

Nevertheless, sickness behavior is a broadly defined term that includes symptoms, experiences, and impact on functioning; the current study focused more specifically on symptoms associated with physical functioning. In the current study, the internal reliability of the total sickness symptoms scores over time (indicative of reliability between participants) was high ( coefficient = 0.89).

As previously described (34) , circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 were assayed with a high sensitivity bead-based multiplex assay (R&D Systems) with a Bio-Plex 200 (Luminex) Instrument, Bio-Plex software v4.1, and a 5-parameter logistic curve fit. All multiplex assays were performed on plasma samples diluted 2-fold according to the manufacturer's protocol, and all calculated concentrations generated by the BioPlex Manager software were included in data analyses. This R&D Systems multiplex assay has been shown to have excellent intra-and inter-assay reproducibility in a recent temporal stability study of circulating cytokine levels (35) and very strong correlations (r \u2265 .94) across a wide range of concentrations with high sensitivity ELISA kits from the same manufacturer (36) . Due to the strength of the parent study design, which utilized up to nine repeated measures of cytokine values for each subject, each time point was evaluated in a single determination. The lower limit of detection was defined as the lowest calculated value obtained on any sample (0.4 and 0.5 pg/mL for IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1, respectively, and 0.1 pg/mL for all others); calculated concentrations <0.1 pg/mL were considered below the limit of detection (35) . Due to the low percentage of IFN-\u03b3 (47%), IL-2 (75%), and IL-1\u03b2 (77%) with detectable levels, as well as the low IL-2 and IL-1\u03b2 concentrations of the samples that were detectable, these biomarkers were excluded from the data analyses. Table 2 presents detectability information and descriptive statistics on cytokines included in analyses (i.e., IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10). Samples with undetectable values for IL-6 and IL-10 were substituted with one-half the concentration of the minimum calculated value per analyte, per plate. Depending on the plate, substituted values ranged from 0.08 -0.27 pg/mL for IL-6 (2% of values) and from 0.05 -0.12 pg/mL for IL-10 (10% of values). No samples were undetectable for TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8. Using these value substitutions is more appropriate than treating the samples with undetectable values as missing at random (37) . Immune variables were natural log-transformed before analyses. For tables and figures, immune data have been back-transformed to original values and, in the case of person-centered immune data, expressed as a difference from the mean.",

More importantly for the hypotheses of this study, these data provide the first evidence that emotional acceptance attenuates these associations; at time points when a given woman increases her acceptance of emotion as compared to her usual functioning, the association between inflammatory biomarkers and sickness behaviors is no longer present. Consistent with our hypothesis, variation in EA moderated the linkage of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 with sickness symptoms at certain times. In other words, when emotional acceptance dropped below average for a given woman, higher levels of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 at that time point were associated with more self-reported sickness symptoms. In contrast, when emotional acceptance increased above average, there was no association between IL-8 or TNF-\u03b1 and sickness symptoms. This variability in the coupling of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 and sickness symptoms suggests a novel mechanism through which a feedback loop of stressinducing sickness behaviors and inflammation might be interrupted.",

However, these results occurred in the context of a different pattern of associations at the average levels of IL-8. Average sickness symptoms were high in subjects whose EA was persistently low, regardless of their average levels of IL-8. These results are consistent with the well-documented association of low EA and negative mood (22) , which is known to perpetuate sickness symptoms (41) . Low average EA perpetuated sickness symptoms after accounting for the linked covariation of IL-8 and symptoms, but this linkage of low average EA with higher average symptoms seems to have remained suppressed by the stronger influence of average TNF-\u03b1 on average symptom levels. These results should be interpreted with caution, however, because mean levels of EA were not associated with sickness symptoms overall and the association of sickness symptoms with the mean level of TNF-\u03b1 was not moderated by EA. Additional research is needed to compare and contrast the influences of emotion regulation and proinflammatory cytokines, and their interaction, on sickness symptoms.",

For TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8, these results and the parallel increases of their average levels with average sickness symptoms are consistent with previous reports (42 , 43) . Additionally, breast cancer tumor cells produce IL-8 (2). IL-8 is an activator and chemoattractant for neutrophils and activated neutrophils release a cascade of inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a chain of tumor secretion of IL-8 to increased inflammation. The lack of increase in average IL-6 for breast cancer patients is not consistent with the majority of studies, although other null results have been reported (44) . The 94% increased likelihood of missing data for subjects with high levels of IL-6 at their sampled time points may have contributed to this outcome.",

The ability to regulate emotions effectively may contribute to fewer disruptions in goal-directed behavior, including health-promoting behaviors (46 , 47) . (However, emotion regulation strategies that are typically considered as effective, such as emotional acceptance, may not be as adaptive in circumstances in which they prevent resources from being used that could help to manage a controllable illness.) Additionally, failure to appropriately regulate strong or persistent negative emotions may hinder cognitive-emotional functioning and contribute to depressive symptoms (48 ) ( 49) , which are known to be associated with greater sickness symptoms. Furthermore, ineffective emotion regulation may also directly disrupt biological functioning, including contributing to decreased parasympathetic nervous system activity, along with heighted activity in the sympathetic nervous system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and immune system (50 -53) . The findings from the present study help to clarify the role of emotional acceptance, and emotion regulation more broadly, in potentially mitigating the vicious inflammationsickness cycle that breast cancer patients may experience.",

However, inflammation and sickness symptoms may also be antecedents of emotional acceptance and other forms of emotion regulation, thus creating a circular, bi-directional process. Although the present study focused on one part of the cycle in which emotional acceptance is effective in a shorter time frame at downregulating the effects of inflammation on sickness symptoms, we found some support for the circularity of these associations. 2 Interventions such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) (54) and Barlow's Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (55) have been demonstrated to increase emotional acceptance in conjunction with decreasing experiential avoidance (56 , 57) . A recent meta-analysis of ACT found it to be effective for reduction of somatic complaints in an analysis of 15 studies with 683 participants (Hedges' g = 0.58, SE =0.13, 95% CI: 0.33-0.84, p < 0.001) (58) . Experimental medicine interventions to test therapies to increase acceptance of emotion are important future steps for testing the mechanisms by which emotion regulation may be effective in uncoupling the linkage of inflammation and sickness behavior.",

Although enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most widely used and best validated method for measuring cytokines, it is limited due to only being able to measure a single protein at a time (59) . An important part of the process in the current study was to determine which cytokines were detectable and told a coherent story. For example, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-1\u03b2 were not used in analyses due to a low percentage of detectable values. In a recent study that used the multiplex immunoassay of cytokines in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, Cheung and colleagues (60) found a substantial portion of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 concentrations were also below the detection limit. Additionally, a previous study using the same multiplex method found a similar proportion of non-detectable IL-1\u03b2 values (35) . Apart from IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-1\u03b2, we found that almost all of the other cytokines assayed in the multiplex (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1) played a coherent role in the story, as hypothesized -either as a main effect (at the mean or person-centered level), or as an interaction effect with emotional acceptance in predicting sickness symptoms. Interestingly, the only cytokine not associated with variables of interest was IL-10, which is predominantly considered an antiinflammatory cytokine and is reported to exert tumor inhibiting action on breast cancer (61) . An important direction for future research will be to take a systems perspective and unpack the associations among multiple cytokines, assessed using multiplex immunoassays, to better understand whether certain cytokines are unique contributors to sickness symptoms in different contexts, or whether other emotion regulatory strategies moderate different cytokines.",
