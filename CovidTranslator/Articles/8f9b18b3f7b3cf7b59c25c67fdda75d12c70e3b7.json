[4] [5] [6] [7] We also found fewer B-cell memory and CD4 T-cell memory responses after AOM infections in children who were sOP. [8] [9] [10] [11] The innate immune system plays a fundamental role in the prevention of AOM. Our group studied the innate immune responses in the blood and nasopharynx at the onset of AOM in children who were sOP compared with children who were not otitis prone (NOP). 9,12-14 Differential expression of innate immunity genes and the mechanisms that regulate innate immunity in chronic rhinosinusitis have also been described previously. 15, 16 Here, to our knowledge, for the first time, we assessed differences in innate immunity in the middle ear of children who were sOP and children who were NOP. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array was used to study the expression of different genes that mainly involve human antibacterial defense. The array included genes involved in bacterial-activated pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signal transduction, encoding downstream effectors important for inflammation and apoptosis, and encoding immune cell-expressed antimicrobial peptides. Such gene expression profiles provide insights into the molecular and cellular changes that occur during AOM and may provide avenues to novel therapeutic treatments or novel biomarkers for disease diagnosis.",

The details of the study design were previously described. 17 The study was approved by the Rochester General Hospital institutional review board. Children received all doses of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine according to the U.S. schedule with either pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 7 or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13, depending on the date of enrollment. A diagnosis of AOM was performed by validated otoscopists (J.C., M.P.) and was based on signs of inflammation (bulging) of the tympanic membrane and presence of middle ear fluid (MEF) documented by tympanocentesis. Written informed consent was obtained from parents of the children at study entry. Tympanocentesis was performed for all AOM episodes. Children who were sOP were defined as those who experienced three or more episodes of AOM within 6 months or four or more episodes within a year. Each MEF was cultured for otopathogens by using standard culture techniques. MEF sampling procedures, microbiology, and organism identification have been previously described.

We used a real-time PCR array that focused on inflammatory cytokines whose role in AOM has been studied extensively 21,25-27 but not previously in an sOP population. We found differential expression in the two populations of children for important genes that relate to host defense. IL-8 showed higher expression in children who were sOP. A previous study showed that overstimulation and dysfunction of recruited neutrophils within the lung result in release of a number of proinflammatory molecules and proteases, which results in damage of lung tissue. 28 This is likely the case in children who were sOP and who experience AOM as well.",

            "text": "IL-8 levels are increased by oxidant stress, which thereby causes recruitment of inflammatory cells and induces a further increase in oxidant stress mediators, which makes it a key cytokine involved in localized inflammation. 29 Observing higher levels of IL-8 messenger RNA as well as higher levels of IL-8 protein in children who were sOP indicated that these children with excessive neutrophil recruitment and localized middle ear mucosa damage due to greater inflammation than occurs in children who were NOP. Elevated IL-8 gene expression was similar whether S. pneumoniae or nontypeable H. influenzae caused AOM. In a previous study, we found lower expression levels of IL-8 in the nasopharynx in children who were sOP. 12 We speculated that the difference is attributable to the time of measurement. The measurement of expression of IL-8 in the nasopharynx was after 5-7 days of upper respiratory infection (URI), whereas measurement of IL-8 in MEF was on day 1 of clinical illness. The role and requirement for IL-8 in chemotaxis for neutrophil recruitment during recurrent infections have been described in other studies that involved other disease conditions. 30, 31 We found fourfold higher levels of SLPI gene expression in children who were sOP. SLPI is generally expressed at mucosal surfaces and plays a role in the defense against the destruction of epithelial tissues by neutrophil elastase. 32 Its higher expression is consistent with the need to control neutrophil elastase damage as well as to indicate that this antineutrophil elastase defense mechanism is not impaired in children who were sOP. In addition, SLPI exerts an impact on mucin gene expression, which is known to be an important regulator in otitis media. 33 Previous studies on lung pathology showed that increased levels of SLPI in nasal secretions and bronchoalveolar fluids may indicate inflammatory lung conditions. 32, 34 Almost always AOM is universally preceded by viral upper respiratory infections (URI). 35, 36 Immune responses to control viral URI are critical to prevent the progression to AOM. We observed a significantly lower expression of IRF7 in children who were sOP. We also observed lower IFN-\u2423 expression in children who were sOP. Lower IRF7 signaling is consistent with our observations that children who were sOP were more prone to viral URIs and consequent bacterial AOM. Howie et al. 37 compared the association of viral URIs and IFN production and found the presence of IFN in most MEF specimens from which virus was absent and bacteria were isolated. Pitkaranta et al. 38, 39 indicated that leukocyte cultures of children with recurrent respiratory tract infections and otitis media with effusion produce less IFN than those of healthy children. Similarly, lower levels of ZBP1, MAPK8, and TICAM2 in MEF samples of children with sOP was consistent with the observed downregulation of the entire IRF7dependent signaling pathway. TICAM2 was shown to be required for IRF7 activation. 40 We found a 2.5-fold lower production of CCL5 (RANTES) expression in children who were sOP. CCL5 is a chemoattractant for T cells, eosinophils, and basophils. We did not detect differences in protein levels of CCL5 in sOP compared with children who were NOP. This may be due to issues of assay sensitivity or sample size and will require further study. Because we previously showed differences in the transcriptome from peripheral blood mononuclear cells when young children experience AOM caused by S. pneumoniae versus nontypeable H. influenzae. 41, 42 , we sought to determine if differences in the innate immune response gene expression occurred in MEF of children who were sOP versus children who were NOP. We found that most of the genes showed a similar pattern, consistent with our previous study 21 However, a few genes showed pathogen-specific differences, including CARD downregulation in children who were sOP caused by S. pneumoniae.",

We sought to mitigate this by normalizing the data with total protein concentrations in MEF. To minimize variability attributable to other aspects of using human samples, we selected samples from children of similar age, race, and URI time points during an AOM event, and restricted to two major otopathogens, nontypeable H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. Our results could be attributed to concurrent viral URI, bacterial colonization, or a combination of the two as well as AOM when the samples were collected. Previous studies that used a conventional culture method showed that 15% of the cases of AOM have bacteria and virus together in MEF and that 5% of MEFs contain viruses alone 36, 43 ; by using molecular diagnostics assays, bacteria and virus together have been detected in up to 66% of AOM cases, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] therefore, the gene expression difference shown in this study could be attributed to viral co-infection in some of the children. Because IL-8 and IRF7 gene pathways are also affected by viral infection, 48, 49 it is not possible to determine if the noted gene expression differences are an epiphenomenon secondary to viral infection or represent a primary host immune response defect.",
