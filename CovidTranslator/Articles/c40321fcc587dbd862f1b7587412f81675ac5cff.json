As a result of successful vaccination programs and campaigns, many vaccine-preventable diseases are now uncommon in the United States. Vaccines for prevention of infectious diseases are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the legal framework for regulation is derived from Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act and from certain sections of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). 1, 2 The FD&C Act defines drugs, in part, by their intended use as \"articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.\" 2 Thus, vaccines are a unique class of pharmaceutical products that meet the statutory definition of both a drug and biological product. Prophylactic vaccines differ from many other drugs and biologicals primarily in how they are administered to a large population, in particular, young healthy people to prevent rather than treat disease, their mechanism of action, and their risk/benefit profile. Although subject to the same regulations as other biological products, vaccines are inherently more difficult to develop, characterize, and manufacture than most pharmaceutical products. Current U.S. licensed vaccines are listed in Tables 79.1 and 79.2.",

Over time, legislative authorities have evolved to strengthen and modernize the regulation of vaccines and other biologics. Prior to 1902, manufacturing and product standards for biologics were not federally mandated. However, in 1902, the U.S. Congress passed an act to regulate the sale of viruses, serums, toxins, and analogous products (later referred to as the Biologics Control Act) following the deaths of 20 children who received contaminated products. 3 This Act authorized the Hygienic Laboratory of the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service to issue regulations that governed all aspects of commercial production of vaccines, serums, toxin, and antitoxins and similar products with the objective of ensuring their safety and purity. The regulations under this legislation contained the primary concepts for regulation of biologicals, such as labeling, mandatory facility inspections, and batch-certification guidelines. In 1930, the Hygienic Laboratory was reorganized, expanded, and renamed the National Institutes of Health (NIH).",

As with the 1902 Act, the 1944 PHS Act focused primarily on extensive control over manufacturing methods to ensure safety and purity. Unique to the 1944 PHS Act was Congress' explicit addition of the requirement that biologics manufacturers demonstrate potency as a measure of clinical usefulness. The PHS Act created the Laboratory of Biologics Control to facilitate testing and licensure of biologicals products and manufacturing establishments. After 1944, the authority of the Laboratory of Biologics Control was derived from Section 351 of the PHS Act and from certain sections of the 1938 FD&C Act. In 1948, the Laboratory of Biologics Control joined the 79 NIH Division of Infectious Diseases and Division of Tropical Diseases to form the National Microbiological Institute (later renamed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases).

The FDA also relies on the expertise of formal advisory committees, which include experts in the fields of vaccinology, microbiology, infectious diseases, immunology, biostatistics, epidemiology, and clinical trial design. In addition, CBER works closely with its counterparts in other U.S. government agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), such as the National Vaccine Program Office, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the NIH, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. The CDC is responsible, among its other duties, for epidemiologic surveillance of disease and for support of immunization programs. Its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations for vaccine use. The Director of the National Vaccine Program Office coordinates vaccine efforts throughout the PHS and other governmental agencies. The NIH is responsible for conducting and providing funds for a wide variety of biomedical research. The Health Resources and Services Administration is responsible for managing the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Other important collaborators inside the U.S. government involved in vaccine activities include the U.S. Department of Defense, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Additionally, CBER works closely with its multilateral partners, notably the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization (WHO), to provide assistance in regulatory capacity building. CBER has been very active in supporting the WHO's Developing Countries' Vaccine Regulators Network and the WHO's African Regional Office-led African Vaccine Regulatory Forum. As a WHO Collaborating Center, CBER contributes to a range of activities, including establishment of physical and written standards, implementation of WHO international standards, strengthening global regulatory systems, and serving as the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) of reference for WHO's vaccine prequalification program.

The clinical development of a new drug in the United States usually begins with a sponsor approaching the FDA for permission to conduct a clinical study with an investigational product through submission of an IND application form. These requirements can be found in the IND regulations. 20 Sponsors are encouraged to request a pre-IND meeting with FDA to discuss preclinical studies, clinical study design, and data requirements that require resolution prior to the initiation of clinical trials. In the application, the sponsor (a) describes the composition, source, and method of manufacture of the product and the methods used in testing its safety, purity, and potency; (b) provides a summary of all laboratory and preclinical animal testing; and (c) provides a description of the proposed clinical study and the names and qualifications of each clinical investigator. The FDA has a maximum of 30 days to review the original IND application and determine whether study participants will be exposed to any unacceptable risks. As part of the IND process, each clinical investigator files information describing the investigator's qualifications for performing clinical trials, details of the proposed study, and assurance that a number of conditions specified by the regulations will be met. A signed informed consent must be obtained from each study participant. Approval for the study must be obtained in advance from a local institutional review board. The regulations also cover the evaluation of the preclinical laboratory animal studies undertaken to support the use of the product in humans.",

CBER uses a team-based approach with substantive involvement of discipline team leaders and management. The Managed Review Process begins when a sponsor requests a pre-investigational new drug (IND) meeting that may result in the submission of an IND and, eventually, a BLA. The review process in CBER begins with an initial review of a submission for scientific content and compliance with the regulations. Members of a multidisciplinary review team are selected based on their expertise with the type of product and its method of manufacture. It is the responsibility of CBER's review component to evaluate submissions and recommend appropriate regulatory action to facilitate the approval of safe and effective biological products. The review includes an evaluation of chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; the manufacturing facility and equipment; preclinical and clinical data on the safety, efficacy, pharmacology, and toxicology; the suitability of clinical trial design; and analysis of clinical data derived from such trials. In addition, reviewers monitor for conformance with FDA regulations in all phases of biological product development, including postmarketing. CBER scientists also perform research in the areas of statistical and epidemiologic analysis, clinical trial design, and chemistry, manufacturing and control specific to product issues, and contribute to policy development. Surveillance activities are performed to ensure that the safety of biological products is not compromised. These activities ensure the rapid availability and approval of safe and effective biological products.",

Effectiveness of PCV13 was inferred from measuring anti-polysaccharide binding and functional opsonophagocytic antibodies because clinical end point disease efficacy studies were no longer feasible owing to the further decline of invasive pneumococcal disease as a result of introduction of PCV7 in the United States. In some situations, human challenge studies have been conducted during early clinical development or in lieu of clinical trials in an endemic area. These studies served to demonstrate \"proof of concept\" of the vaccine early in clinical development (e.g., Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite challenge of malaria-na\u00efve U.S. volunteers previously administered a candidate malaria vaccine). Human challenge studies may also be considered to demonstrate the efficacy of the vaccine. For example, the Agency convened the Vaccines and Related Biologics Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) to consider whether data from human challenge studies in U.S. subjects could be sufficient to demonstrate efficacy of a cholera vaccine in travelers to endemic areas who are at high risk for contracting the disease. In 1998, the VRBPAC agreed that human challenge studies could suffice to demonstrate efficacy of a cholera vaccine provided that studies were adequate and well-controlled and conducted under the provisions of good clinical practices. 21 In 2016, the FDA approved Vaxchora, a live, attenuated vaccine for the prevention of cholera in adults traveling to cholera-affected areas.

Vaccine efficacy should be demonstrated, ideally in randomized, double-blind, well-controlled trials. The end points are product specific, and may be clinical disease end points or immune response end points if efficacy against clinical disease had been previously established and there are immune correlates or surrogates of that protection. In recent years, efficacy trials for various vaccines have involved a broad range in the number of study participants, from thousands to tens of thousands. This broad range is related to a number of interconnected variables such as study design and the incidence of the disease to be prevented. For example, clinical disease end point studies that are designed to demonstrate that a new vaccine is noninferior to an already existing product of the same type generally require larger numbers than one in which a new vaccine can be compared with a control that has no activity against the clinical disease. The incidence of the disease to be prevented in the study population is also important. As an example, a trial to show that pneumococcal submission, including methods for presenting the data; (c) information on the status of needed or ongoing studies; and (d) any other information for discussion at the meeting. The primary purpose of this exchange is to uncover any major unresolved problems; identify those studies that the sponsor is relying on as adequate and well-controlled to establish the product's effectiveness; identify the status of ongoing studies; acquaint FDA reviewers with the general information to be submitted in the BLA (including technical information); review methods used in the statistical analysis of the data; and discuss the best approach for the presentation and formatting of data in the application. At the time that an applicant submits a BLA to the Director of CBER's Office of Vaccines Research and Review precise production methods and procedures should be defined, and the manufacturing process should be standardized. Critical information to be contained in the BLA include data derived from nonclinical laboratory and clinical studies that demonstrate that the manufactured product meets prescribed requirements for safety, purity, and potency. The BLA should contain information that supports compliance with standards addressing requirements for (a) organization and personnel; (b) buildings and facilities; (c) equipment; (d) control of components, containers, and closures; (e) production and process controls; (f) packaging and labeling controls; (g) holding and distribution; (h) laboratory controls; and (i) records to be maintained.

This process occurs for each BLA or supplement to a BLA in which significant changes are proposed. During the review, there are discussions and exchanges of correspondence between the sponsor and the CBER review committee concerning issues that may arise. During the FDA review of the BLA an announced prior approval inspection (PAI) of the manufacturing facility is performed. This inspection is designed as an in-depth review of the facilities, records, total production process, methods, equipment, quality control procedures, and personnel. With the implementation of the BLA process, changes have occurred in the scope of issues reviewed during the PAI. Instead of the manufacturer submitting detailed records with the BLA regarding studies on cleaning validation, monitoring data for licensed vaccines. The initial responsibility for determining vaccine safety starts with clinical investigators and vaccine manufacturers. The FDA is responsible for assuring that clinical trials are done under good clinical practices, a requirement essential for the evaluation of safety data intended to support a license application. In general, when evaluating safety, one must compare the risk of the vaccine-preventable disease with the risk of the adverse event(s) potentially associated with the vaccine, and these may change over time. As an example, the reported association between Rotashield (rotavirus vaccine, live, oral, tetravalent, manufactured by Wyeth) and intussusception resulted in the additional requirement for the evaluation of the safety of RotaTeq (live, oral pentavalent human-bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine, manufactured by Merck) with respect to intussusception. This clinical trial enrolled more than 70,000 infants divided equally between RotaTeq and placebo. The primary safety hypothesis was that the oral RotaTeq would not increase the risk of intussusception relative to placebo within 42 days of any dose. The intended target population should be taken into consideration in assessing the adequacy of the safety database. For routinely administered childhood vaccines in the United States, the target population would be the birth cohort in the United States (approximately 4 million/year). This is generally a healthy population, and a government body (e.g., state or local governments) may mandate vaccination. Common reactions can be studied adequately in hundreds of individuals, but many thousands will be required to define low-incidence adverse reactions.",

Prior to the submission of a BLA, a pre-BLA meeting with the FDA is strongly encouraged to discuss the sponsor's product development plan. For the FDA to provide sponsors with advice regarding the adequacy of information to support a BLA, the following information in advance of the pre-BLA meeting should be submitted, depending on the type of meeting: (a) an executive summary of the clinical studies to be submitted in the application; (b) a proposed format for organizing the strate safety and efficacy in humans are required at the time of use. Under new Section 505(o) of the FD&C Act, the FDA is authorized to also require postmarketing studies or clinical trials at the time of approval or after approval if the FDA becomes aware of new safety information. Section 505(o)(3) (B) states that postmarketing studies and clinical trials may be required to (a) assess a known serious risk related to the use of the drug involved, (b) assess signals of serious risk related to the use of the drug, and (c) identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk and when the adverse event reporting system is not adequate. The FDA has defined a clinical trial as any prospective investigation in which the sponsor or investigator determines the method of assigning treatment or other intervention to one or more human subjects. A study is all other investigations, such as investigations using humans, that are not clinical trials as defined above (e.g., observational epidemiologic studies), animal studies, and laboratory experiments. The FDA has issued guidance for industry to describe the type of studies and clinical trials that are required (Post Marketing Requirement [PMR]) under the FDAAA 2007, and those that will remain agreed-upon postmarketing commitments. A PMR describes all required postmarketing studies or clinical trials including those required under Accelerated Approval, PREA, the Animal Rule, and FDAAA. Examples of required studies are pharmacoepidemiologic studies designed to assess a serious risk, trials with a primary safety end point, preclinical studies investigating specific end organ toxicities, as well as pharmacokinetic studies in the indicated population at potential risk for high drug exposure that could result in toxicity. Studies that generally would not be considered required postmarketing studies or clinical trials are agreed-upon studies (postmarketing commitments) and include biologic quality studies (such as manufacturing, stability, and immunogenicity studies that do not have a primary safety end point), trials in which the primary end point is related to further defining efficacy, and pharmacoepidemiologic studies designed to examine the natural history of disease or background rates for adverse events. Since passage of FDAAA 2007, several new vaccines have been approved with either PMRs or postmarketing commitments. The FDA has the authority to monitor the progress of postmarketing studies or trials by requiring the applicant to submit an annual status report. Applicants are required to provide a timetable for study completion, a periodic status report on the status of the study including whether enrollment has begun, the number of participants enrolled, the expected completion date, and whether any difficulties in completing the study have been encountered.",

The applicant is required to submit an account of these changes to the appropriate license applications. Modifications to the manufacturing process may occur post licensure, such as scale-up or change in equipment to optimize the production process. Furthermore, clinical studies with the product also may be performed after licensure as the manufacturer seeks additional indications for product use (e.g., new target populations that would benefit from vaccination). For most new approvals, manufacturers may be asked to commit to completing specific postmarketing or so-called Phase IV studies, for example, to provide additional assessments of less-common or rare adverse events or further assess the duration of vaccine-induced immunity. These studies may also be designed to collect additional safety data in large numbers of vaccine recipients, as well as focus on issues that were identified during the prelicensure testing. Submission of status reports for certain postmarketing studies are required by regulation. In particular, this requirement for status reports pertains to postmarketing studies for clinical safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics, and nonclinical toxicology to which an applicant committed in writing prior to licensure. 22 Prior to FDAAA 2007, the FDA required postmarketing studies in the following situations (a) accelerated approvals for products approved under 505(b) of the FD&C Act or Section 351 of the PHS Act, respectively, which require postmarketing studies to demonstrate clinical benefit, (b) deferred pediatric studies, where studies are required under PREA, and (c) Animal Efficacy Rule approvals, where studies to demon-lesser importance for which the manufacturer must provide notification 30 days before distribution of product made using the change; and (c) changes for which the manufacturer need only notify the agency by submission of an annual report. The guidance document, \"Changes to an Approved Application: Biological Products\" (1997) , provides examples of changes that fall into these categories. 26 Following approval, there is continued surveillance of the product and of the manufacturer's production activities. For most licensed vaccines, samples are submitted along with protocols for each lot prepared by the firm that provide the details of production and a summary of test results. Although not required by law or regulation, CBER often performs selected laboratory tests. The type and extent of confirmatory testing performed by CBER depend on several factors, such as the newness of the product or the difficulties that may have arisen with manufacture or use of the product. Release or rejection is based on a review of all test results, including those done by the manufacturer and those performed by CBER. Alternatives to official lot release are allowable under the provisions outlined for extensively characterized products having a track record of continued safety, purity, and potency. 27 A manufacturer must be able to produce a vaccine that repeatedly meets the standards for potency, purity, and stability of bulk and final container material while using a consistent process. Important factors to be considered are the nature of the product with respect to correlation between the measure of potency and biological activity and effectiveness.

Manufacturers who fail to meet product standards or who are not in compliance with CGMPs may have their licenses suspended or revoked, depending on the nature of the potential health hazards created. The major issues observed during inspections can be categorized in three major areas: (1) process-related issues, (2) quality unit-related issues, and (3) facility-and production environment-related issues. Some examples of process validation issues include lack of documentation of time limits for major steps in the production process, lack of validation of rework or reprocessing steps in the manufacturing process, and lack of data to support in-process specifications. Quality unit-related issues include the appropriate reporting of out-of-specification results and process deviations (including adequate investigations into causes), appropriate documentation of product release, and adequate training of personnel. Facility and production monitoring concerns include controlling production environments by appropriately monitoring heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system performance and microbial quality (e.g., pressure differentials, appropriate sampling sites, and frequency of sampling). Other concerns pertaining to the facility include adequate cleaning, sanitization, storage, and changeover procedures for multiproduct areas and equipment. If the inspection team finds CGMP deficiencies in an already licensed facility, the team may remain in the facility until they have achieved an audit that provides confidence in the ability of the firm to reproducibly manufacture a safe and potent product.",

Testing procedures are developed with the goals of controlling and minimizing the potential for productrelated adverse events by taking into consideration the experience gained from the same or related products. As an example, for inactivated vaccines, a clear understanding of the kinetics of inactivation is critical. For live vaccines, attenuation must be stable both to avoid reversion to virulence and to avoid the vaccine becoming over attenuated and, as a consequence, less potent. For example, during the first decade of its widespread use, Yellow Fever 17D vaccine virus was serially propagated in eggs, as required to meet demand. However, it soon became obvious that the level of attenuation of the vaccine from one passage to the next could vary considerably. Some lots were excessively neurovirulent, especially in infants and young children, whereas successive lots might by chance be overattenuated and, consequently, not immunogenic. The WHO formulated a solution to this problem, which was to adopt a \"seed-lot system\" wherein the vaccine is prepared from a master seed virus at a specified passage number in eggs. Working seed virus is prepared by one passage of the master seed and is, in turn, used to generate all production lots. All 17D vaccines and all other live virus vaccines now adhere to a seed-lot system for manufacture.",

Labeling provisions contained in 21 CFR \u00a7 \u00a7201.57 and 201.56 require that prescribing information must summarize the essential information on the safe and effective use of the product; that information contained in the labeling must be accurate and not false and misleading; and that there must be no implied claims or suggestions for use if evidence of safety or effectiveness is lacking. 32 Whenever possible, data contained in labeling should be derived from human experience. In the United States, the FDA regulates the format and content of labels for product containers, cartons, and the package insert that accompanies the product. In January 2006, the FDA issued a final drug labeling rule, commonly referred to as the Physicians' Labeling Rule, amending the content and format of prescribing information for human drug and biologic products. The new format is intended to provide healthcare professionals with clear and concise prescribing information by reorganizing critical information into a streamlined format. Moreover, these revisions make it simpler for healthcare professionals to access, read, and use prescribing information, and enhance the safe and effective use of prescription drug products. New sections were added to the label, such as the Highlights section, which contains key benefit and risk information, and a table of contents for the full prescribing information. On December 3, 2014, the FDA issued the Pregnancy Lactation and Labeling Rule, which revises the content and format of the pregnancy subsection of labeling for prescription drugs and biologics (Sections 8.1 to 8.3 of the prescribing information). Previous regulations required that each product be classified under one of five pregnancy categories (A, B, C, D, or X) based on the risk of reproductive and developmental adverse effects or, for certain categories, such risk weighed against potential benefit. The most significant change proposed by the rule is the replacing of these letter risk categories with a narrative summary of the risks and benefits of using a drug during pregnancy, based on the available human and/or animal data and a discussion of the data. Additionally, the rule requires that prescription drug labeling include relevant clinical information to help healthcare providers make prescribing decisions and counsel women about the use of drugs during pregnancy and/or lactation.",

Although chick embryo fibroblasts are still used for the production of viral vaccines, these cell substrates must be well-characterized and tested to assure absence of potentially infectious agents. Issues related to cell substrates have been discussed in a variety of forums. [29] [30] [31] Furthermore, if a vaccine is manufactured in a cell substrate that is derived from a tumor, or that has developed a tumorigenic phenotype through an unknown mechanism, it was considered to carry a higher theoretical risk of containing oncogenic substances such as oncogenic viruses and cellular DNA, derived from that cell substrate. This was the main reason tumorigenic cells or cells derived from human tumors had been considered unsuitable as cell substrates. However, at a 2012 meeting of the VRBPAC, experts recognized that cell lines derived from human tumor are an important tool for manufacturing of vaccines and could provide a wider repertoire of cell substrates for vaccine production. 30 They indicated that risk-mitigation strategies are the same for vaccines generated using human tumor-derived cell lines as for other cell substrates. A thorough characterization of the cell substrate with respect to adventitious viruses, which includes oncogenic viruses, should be done using new virus-detection technologies such as massively parallel sequencing, virus microarrays and broad-range polymerase chain reaction to complement existing assays. The manufacturing process should lower the amount and reduce the size of the DNA. Residual DNA for continuous nontumorigenic cells, such as low-passage Vero cells, should be limited to less than 10 ng/dose for parenteral inoculation and to less than 100 \u00b5g/dose for oral vaccines. Cells with tumorigenic phenotypes or other characteristics that give rise to special concerns may require more stringent limitation of residual DNA quantities and size to assure product safety.",

Development and availability of such vaccines, particularly for use in the developing countries most affected by these diseases, will benefit U.S. and global health. In 2011, the FDA published a revised guidance document to assist sponsors in developing vaccines targeted against infectious diseases or conditions endemic in areas outside the United States. The FDAAA of 2007 revised the FD&C Act by adding Section 524, recognizing the importance of having products to treat and prevent tropical diseases that disproportionately affect poor and marginalized populations and for which there is no significant market in developed nations. Under Section 524, the Agency can grant priority review of applications under Section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act or Section 351 of the PHS Act for the treatment and prevention of specified tropical diseases, including tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, and \"any other infectious disease for which there is no significant market in developed nations and that disproportionately affects poor and marginalized populations, designated by regulation by the Secretary.\" Consequently, this guidance provides general recommendations for regulatory pathways to use in the development of vaccines to protect against global infectious diseases for U.S. licensure and clarifies applicable regulations: (a) the FDA can license vaccines to protect against infectious diseases or conditions that are not endemic or have not been reported to occur in the United States; (b) the regulatory pathways to U.S. licensure for the development of vaccines to protect against infectious diseases that are not endemic or have not been reported to occur in the United States are the same as for vaccines to protect against diseases that are endemic in the United States; (c) a sponsor may submit data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States to support product licensure, (d) noting that the accelerated approval regulations may be used in appropriate cases; and (e) that when pivotal studies are conducted outside the United States, in some instances, it may not be necessary to conduct studies in the United States. This guidance also responded to the congressional mandate in Section 740 of the fiscal year 2010 Appropriation Act (Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010, Public Law 111-80) by requiring the FDA to make recommendations on appropriate preclinical, trial design, and regulatory paradigms to prevent, diagnose, and treat rare diseases and neglected diseases.",

New smallpox vaccines are being developed under IND applications, with the goal to seek licensure, and new vaccinia immunoglobulin reactions such as pain, swelling, injection site necrosis, and granulomas. Systemic reactions may include nausea, fever, arthritis, as well as potential immunotoxic reactions. Unexpected, rare events may also occur. For example, during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009-10, an increased risk of narcolepsy, a chronic neurological disorder caused by the brain's inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally, was observed in several European countries following vaccination with an AS03 adjuvanted, monovalent 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine, Pandemrix. [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] The finding of narcolepsy in several European countries following vaccination with Pandemrix caused the European Medicines Agency to recommend restricting use of Pandemrix. 44 Pandemrix was not licensed for use in the United States and no adjuvanted influenza vaccines were used in the United States during the influenza pandemic. The CDC published a study on a possible association between U.S.-licensed unadjuvanted 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines, 2010-11 seasonal influenza vaccines, and narcolepsy. 45 The analysis included more than 650,000 people who received the pandemic influenza vaccine in 2009 and more than 870,000 people who received the seasonal influenza vaccine in 2010-11. The study found that neither vaccine was associated with an increased risk for narcolepsy. Additional studies including those conducted by the vaccine manufacturer will help discern whether this finding is attributable to the adjuvant, the H1N1 vaccine antigen, or both.",

To enable an initiation of these pivotal studies in an expedited manner, the FDA engaged in joint reviews with vaccine manufacturers, the WHO, regulatory agencies in Europe and Canada, and West African regulators to discuss study designs, ethical considerations, and required product information to reach international regulatory convergence, thus facilitating trial initiation. It is not always possible to test whether a vaccine or treatment will work against a new or emerging infectious disease, or against a biothreat, because the threat may be rare or even nonexistent at the time the vaccine or therapy needs to be developed. Moreover, many vaccines against EIDs and biothreats pose difficult challenges with regard to obtaining clinical efficacy data. For many of these infectious agents or toxins, human efficacy trials are not feasible because natural exposure no longer occurs (e.g., smallpox), occurs at a very low incidence, or occurs in an unpredictable manner. The animal rule described earlier (see \"Accelerating Availability of Vaccines and Pathways to Licensure\") is one regulatory mechanism that allows the FDA to address the challenges of obtaining clinical efficacy data for these products if the results of adequate and well-controlled animal studies establish that the product is reasonably likely to provide clinical benefits to humans.",

Vaccines against EIDs are more likely to use novel technologies, and the science behind these technologies may be more complex; for example, use of novel cell substrates, the need to develop alternative potency assays, and the need to identify surrogate markers in humans or animals that predict vaccine effectiveness. To respond to this challenge, the FDA collaborates with interagency groups within the Department of Health and Human Services, such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the CDC, and the NIH, as well as the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to prepare for responding to an emergency. A committed, continuous investment in regulatory science is essential to producing medical countermeasures against public health threats. As noted in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Review, 46 \"Enhancement and ultimate application of updated regulatory science and scientific review capacity will help strengthen the MCM [medical countermeasure] regulatory process and thus streamline the MCM development process.",

This included creating vaccine strains needed for vaccine manufacturing within weeks of the very first 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza cases appearing, developing reagents and tests through international collaborations to measure the vaccine's potency, consulting the FDA's expert vaccine advisory committee to review the Agency's approach to approval of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine s as well as extensive in process quality control and product testing. Licensure of vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus occurred in September 2009 based on the FDA's determination that standards to ensure the safety and potency of these vaccines had been met. In parallel to these efforts, NIH and vaccine manufacturers initiated clinical trials to determine the optimal vaccine dosage and number of doses needed to induce a protective immune response against pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus.",

To address this need, the FDA engaged with federal partners, sponsors of medical products, and international organizations to facilitate development of vaccines. To advance promising vaccine candidates to Phase I clinical trials to obtain preliminary human safety data, the FDA worked closely with manufacturers, clinical trial sponsors, and international regulators to rapidly assess product characterization data and protocols for these first human clinical trials and granted permission for the initiation of these Phase I studies in an expedited manner. Guidance provided by the FDA assured that these studies were References for this chapter are available at ExpertConsult.com.",

The statutes of the PHS Act are implemented through regulations codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The CFR is published annually and contains all changes in regulations that have occurred during the previous year that were published in the Federal Register. Regulations are adopted in conformity with the Administrative Procedure Act. 11 Thus, before a regulation can be established, repealed, or revised, it must be proposed and published in the Federal Register with an invitation to all interested individuals or parties to comment within a prescribed time, commonly a period of 1 to several months. Once comments are received, they are evaluated and considered by the FDA before publication of the final regulation in the Federal Register.Title 21 of the CFR, parts 600 through 680, contains regulations specifically applicable to vaccines and other biologicals. In addition, because vaccines meet the legal definition of a drug under the FD&C Act, manufacturers must comply with regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) (parts 210 and 211).Table 79.4 summarizes the regulations applicable to vaccines and other biological products.",
