            "text": "Edward J. Dubovi, PhD Canine influenza as a recognized clinical entity in dogs has a relatively brief history. There were a few early reports on the presence of antibodies to human influenza virus in dogs and the ability to induce an antibody response in dogs when challenged with the human influenza virus. 1, 2 However, no clinical disease was linked to any natural or experimental exposures. This scenario changed mainly as a result of 2 events. The emergence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 in Southeast Asia in 1996-1997 focused public health efforts on the potential of a new pandemic of human influenza. Funding became available for enhanced surveillance programs and validation of molecular testing that could detect virtually any strain of influenza virus regardless of the hemagglutinin (HA) subtype. Although the focus in the animal world was mainly on migrating wild birds as vehicles for the spread of the virus to distant regions, any animal with respiratory signs became a target for testing. The relative ease of testing with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology has expanded surveillance at all levels.",

            "text": "The second event that defined the beginning of canine influenza was the isolation of an influenza virus from racing greyhounds that experienced moderate to severe respiratory infections in early 2004. 3 This report focused the canine world on the possibility that the influenza virus was a contributor to the acute respiratory disease complex in canines. Subsequent data showed that this virus had a unique genetic signature that defined a new entity known as canine influenza virus (CIV). 3, 4 With the introduction of the term CIV, there is a need to define the nomenclature that is used in this review. Canine influenza is used to note the disease in dogs induced by any influenza virus infection. CIV is reserved for those viruses that have a defined genetic signature that sets them apart from their progenitor virus. All influenza viruses originated in avian species, but with time some have become established in an alternative host. Most pertinent for this discussion is the entity H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV). Although this virus is most certainly of avian origin, association with the equine host has brought about sequence changes that clearly define a virus that is separate from the H3N8 virus circulating in birds at present. The first influenza virus isolated from clinically ill dogs was an H3N8 of equine origin. However, the virus does have a genetic signature related to the HA protein that distinguishes it from the equine progenitor. 3, 4 CIV is defined as unique not only by genetic changes but also by the biologic difference of not being able to establish a productive infection in experimentally challenged horses (Landolt GA, Colorado Springs, CO, personal communication, May 2010.) CIV in this article is used exclusively for the genetically distinct H3N8 virus isolated in canines in the United States. As more genetic information becomes available on viruses isolated from canines, this nomenclature may need to be changed to account for the multiple H and N (ie, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase) subtypes linked to canine influenza.",

Attempts to identify the cause of these outbreaks failed to consistently identify an agent that could be linked to the acute respiratory disease cases. With the identification of influenza virus associated with one outbreak, serologic testing on other animals linked to the racing industry quickly determined that the exposure to what became known as the CIV was widespread. Additional isolates from greyhounds were identified in Texas in July 2004 3 and Iowa in April 2005. 9 Although the finding of CIV in racing greyhounds was a significant event, an important question was whether this virus would find its way into the companion animal population. In 2005, both virus isolations and serologic data confirmed that CIV had moved into companion animals in Florida and the New York City area. 4, 5 This discovery was followed in early 2006 with the identification of the virus in the Denver, Colorado area. Transmission of CIV from dog to dog was clearly involved in these cases, indicating a new cross-species jump of influenza virus.",

Even with the earliest CIV isolates, there were amino acid changes in the HA protein that distinguished CIV from the EIVs circulating in the United States. Questions concerning the origin of this virus and its genetic drift became active areas of interest. To date, all CIV isolates examined belong to a single lineage, that is, the data point to a single introduction of a unique variant of EIV (Donis RO, Atlanta, GA, personal communication, June 2010.) 3, 4 These analyses include CIV isolates from Florida, New York, Colorado, and all areas into which CIV was carried from these 3 enzootic areas. As with all influenza viruses, genetic drift is occurring as the virus continues to circulate in dogs. There is some suggestion that should the virus continue to circulate, unique clades may develop that are linked to the geographic centers of infection, not unlike what has happened with EIV.",

Best estimates are that this event may have occurred in 1999-2000. No CIV isolates exist before 2003, and serologic data may not be of help because of the ability of EIV to infect dogs. The key biologic difference between EIV and CIV is the ability of CIV to be transmitted from dog to dog. Experimental infections have clearly shown transmissibility of CIV. 10 Some confusion was caused by reports of the presence of antibodies to CIV in dogs in the United Kingdom. 11 It soon became evident that EIV could infect dogs, but the virus was not transmitted beyond the initial focus of infection. This discovery was confirmed during the large epizootic outbreak of EIV in Australia in 2007, where EIV was transmitted to dogs from horses on the affected farms. The infections were detected by RT-PCR and serology, but no evidence of transmission to contact dogs was found. 12 Experimentally, EIV was transmitted from infected horses to in-contact dogs. 13 Because EIV and CIV are antigenically very similar, standard serologic tests cannot distinguish between infections caused by EIV or CIV. Accordingly, serologic data indicating low levels of CIV infection should not be given credibility in the absence of isolation of an influenza virus with the genetic signature of CIV.",

Transmission of the virus among dogs readily occurs in group-housing situations such as animal shelters and boarding kennels, but the areas of the country where the virus is now enzootic are limited. The reasons for this defined geographic limitation are unknown. Outbreaks of CIV have occurred outside the enzootic areas of Florida, New York/Philadelphia, and Denver, but the virus has so far failed to become established in new areas (Dubovi, unpublished observations) . CIV was isolated in San Diego (2006), Los Angeles (2007), Pittsburgh (2007) , and Northern Virginia (2009), and dogs that tested positive in RT-PCR tests for CIV were detected in the Chicago area (2008), but none of these population centers have maintained the virus. CIV travels with dogs, and sporadic outbreaks have occurred in kennels that received rescue dogs taken from an enzootic area. Quarantine of the affected kennels stopped the spread of the virus. As with other mammalian-influenza virus interactions, there is no evidence for a true carrier state, so the maintenance of the virus depends on acute infections of susceptible populations. Although the virus is transmissible among dogs, it is not highly contagious perhaps because of the low amount of virus produced by the infected dogs (Dubovi, unpublished observation, 2007 ). 14",

Nasal swabs from the affected dogs were inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs, and influenza virus was isolated from the cases. 19 Sequence analysis of the virus revealed it to be an avian-origin H3N2 virus. Comparisons with data in GenBank for all 8 gene segments revealed 95.5% to 98.9% homology to avian influenza viruses in East Asia. No contemporary avian isolates circulating in South Korea at the time of the canine infections were available for direct comparison with the canine isolates. It is not clear at present whether the virus involved in these cases was simply an avian virus with enhanced capability to infect dogs or a virus with a unique genetic signature enabling transmission in dogs, as with CIV. Virus isolated from the affected dogs was used to experimentally inoculate 10-week-old puppies, and the exposed animals showed typical signs of an acute respiratory infection within 2 days after infection. 20 Virus was recovered from nasal swabs, and sequence analysis showed that the recovered virus was identical to that used to initial the infection. The amount of virus shed in the experimentally infected animals significantly exceeded that found for the H3N8 CIV, suggesting that the H3N2 subtype is capable of more extensive replication in dogs. Although a dog-to-dog transmission study was also reported, the results were ambiguous because of the possibility that the in-contact dogs became infected by the original inoculum.",

A report from China indicated that 2 of 52 sick dogs were positive for an H1N1 virus that was 99% homologous to the 2009 presumably human H1N1 virus. 23 A dog in New York State with a 2-to 3-day history of a respiratory infection tested positive for H1N1. 24 The dog's owner reported that he had also been tested positive for H1N1 earlier in the week.

A clinician would find it hard, if not impossible, to distinguish the disease caused by an influenza virus infection from that caused by the other 6 viruses associated with ARDD. For CIV cases in the United States there is almost always a link to animal shelters, boarding kennels, or day care centers for dogs. The distinguishing feature, however, is the degree of morbidity within the facility. For most cases of ARDD, few dogs show signs because prior exposure and vaccination reduce the attack rate. For CIV, virtually all dogs are susceptible regardless of age, and attack rates of 60% to 80% are not unusual in group settings. The situation in South Korea with the H3N2 strain appears to be similar in that there was a high attack rate in dog farms and kennels, but low seroprevalence in companion animals. 21, 22 Casual contact between dogs does not seem to be a highrisk factor, and this may relate to the relatively low amount of virus produced in dogs with CIV.",

The detectable signs are somewhat related to the time from infection to the date of the examination. Common signs in most dogs are lethargy, anorexia, nasal discharge, sneezing, depression, ocular discharge, and cough, with coughing lasting up to 3 weeks postinfection. This range of clinical signs has been reproduced experimentally with both H3N8 CIV and the avian H3N2 virus. 14,20 Initially a nasal discharge may be clear, but it can quickly become mucopurulent. Many dogs show only a lowgrade fever that may persist for 1 to 4 days. In uncomplicated cases a persistent, dry, and nonproductive cough develops, which may last for several weeks. Many dogs are diagnosed as having pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, or abnormal lung sounds. In natural settings, serious lung involvement is usually caused by the secondary bacteria, or mycoplasma infections that are enhanced with compromised lung defenses. In group settings, multiple viral pathogens may be circulating, which further complicates the identity of a causative agent (Dubovi, unpublished observation, 2009 ). 26 The mortality rate directly as a result of influenza virus infections is difficult to determine, given the negative effect of other respiratory agents.",

All challenge data for the avian-origin H3N2 have been done with the same virus, so no viral comparisons are available. 20, 27 As one could expect with a respiratory pathogen, the early lesions in the upper respiratory tract are consistent with tracheitis and bronchitis with some extension to the bronchioles. There are areas of epithelial cell necrosis, loss of cuboidal glandular cells, and infiltration of the propriasubmucosa by mixtures of inflammatory cells. As a result, the normal defense of the respiratory tract provided by the ciliated epithelial cells is severely compromised. The effect of the virus infection on the lower respiratory tract can be highly variable, and the lesions noted are more severe in the later stages of the infection. On day 3 postinfection, there were numerous petechial hemorrhages in most lobes of the lung. 14 At later times in the infection, consolidated areas of the lung could be seen, which coincided with an increase in clinical signs. Histopathological lesions consisted of peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells (tracheobronchitis and bronchiolitis), diffuse thickening of alveolar septa by infiltrates of inflammatory cells, and infiltration of the alveoli by neutrophils and macrophages (alveolitis). 14, 27, 28 The reported lesions were in animals that tested negative for other pathogens, which indicates that influenza virus alone is able to cause significant pathologic changes.",

The reasons for this are timing and the low level of virus produced by the infected dogs. At best, the tests are 50% sensitive and should be used only in multiple-dog outbreaks where the timing factor is discounted by sampling of multiple dogs at various stages of infection. Its use in this context is simply to define the presence of virus in a group-housing situation, and in that context, the tests can have significant value.",

The most sensitive test historically was the HI test, but to use this test to screen for any exposure, one had to use 16 different viruses to cover all influenza virus H subtypes. For HI testing one has to be aware of nonspecific reactions in the testing that can lead to false positives. An agar-gel immunodiffusion test using the nucleoprotein (NP) as an antigen successfully detects any influenza virus infection in poultry, but it lacks sensitivity in mammalian systems. ELISA tests using the same NP antigen are now in use at present for avian samples and were used for dogs in Korea.",

The test has high sensitivity because it can detect antibody responses in dogs in as early as 7 days postinfection. 14 In the absence of other H subtypes of influenza virus in circulation, it is the test of choice. In clinical cases where the dog has shown clinical signs for more than 5 days, agent detection tests are rarely successful, so serology should be used to define an influenza virus infection. Acute and convalescent sampling can be done, but with the low prevalence of infection in the United States, a single sample collected more than 7 days after onset of signs is highly useful in defining exposure.",

Treatment of the individual animal from a single-pet household is largely the same regardless of the agent involved; treatment involves coverage with a broad-spectrum antibiotic to prevent or treat a bacterial or mycoplasma-enhanced pneumonia. For the individual dog, the cost to determine the causative agent may be difficult to justify to the owner if the treatment is unaffected by the outcome. For kennel situations, it is important to know the precipitating agent because this may dictate the manner in which the animals are managed and whether movement restrictions are in order.",

As expected, the vaccines did not prevent infection, a finding that is consistent with virtually all killed influenza-virus products in any species. There are no data on the duration of immunity, but yearly vaccinations are recommended. In those settings where there is a defined risk for influenza virus infections, these vaccines would be appropriate to be recommended with the same justification as traditional kennel cough vaccines.",
