Information diffusion has been a concerning public issue, especially in marketing and rumors of emergencies. In social networks, users are no longer simple receivers; therefore, the behavior of individuals plays an extremely important role in their social network evolution and propagation process. Individuals exchange information with their neighbors which construct their social relations. The social network topologies of users formed gradually when all users of the network by topological relation covered together, eventually forming a huge and complex relationship between social networks. Social influence refers to the behavioral change that one individual causes in another, deliberately or inadvertently. As a result, the changed individual observes with the relationship to influencer . The strength of social influence depends on the relationships among individuals, network distances, timing, characteristics of networks and individuals, etc. Due to the emergence and rapid development of social networking websites, information tends to spread faster than before. Information diffusion offers a perfect framework for persistent neural networks. However, the nodes of information diffusion have changed with the emergence of technology.",

It may remain occasionally outside these bounds. Several networks have been stated to be the scale = free. However, a statistical study has disproved those claims. We discuss the model in the scale-free network. Bonnekoh (2003) studied the Sznajd model in a scale-free network with growth characteristics. A scale-free network is constructed in the same way as Barabasi and Albert's network creation method, which is adding only one individual at a time, and it is related to the individual degree in the original network. Barabasi and Albert believe that many network models do not consider two important characteristics: Growth and Preferential Attachment. Because of the lack of consideration of these two characteristics, it creates a Scale Free Network, which is also called BA Network (Haoguang et al., 2008) . For a network that satisfies the scale-free characteristics. Scale Free Network Model was introduced in (Haoguang et al., 2008) . This model presents the basic characteristics of a scale-free network and investigates from the perspective of statistical mechanics. This method summarized the design deficiencies of the above model. It also proposed an improved design based on the B-A model (edge-edge-reconnection theory), which can well explain the prevalence nature of the disease with scientific and practical significance. E-mail Virus diffusion Model was introduced in (Jun et al., 2009) which is based on the scale-free network. By mathematical calculations, the density of infected users is obtained, which was affected by many parameters. It shows that the volume of infected users becomes stable before the anti-virus technique activated. Moreover, it was observed that the diffusion rate and average degree of network played an important role. Network Topology of Command and Control (C2) Organization was presented in (Xiuli et al., 2010) . This research organizes the C2 construct based on the concept of complex network theory and network center warfare thinking. It also provides a theoretical basis for further complex network theory through simulation analysis. It finds out that the C2 organization construct has specific characteristics of a complex network. Simulation of Virus Propagation was discussed in (Tao et al., 2007) . This simulation showed that the scale-free network plays an important role in controlling the diffusion of computer virus. The research constructs a B-A Scale Free Network Model (Barabsi -Alert Scale Free Network Model), and simulate on the diffusion of computer virus and its influence. SA-mixed network models were introduced in (Jing and Bing, 2016) . This model designs and constructs several scale-free networks to verify scale-freeness and compares the speed of development of the original and new networks by using the iterative method. A SA mixed network model was constructed based on the Sierpiandki network with the two Apollonian networks to verify the power distribution of the new network with power-law between two and three. It shows that scale-free properties are closed to mixed networks between scale-free networks. The significance of nodes was discussed in . A node in a complex network simulates the relationship between the largest connected component and the proportion of removed nodes to calculate the significance and reliability of the complex network. The results were conducted based on the degree of centrality, semi-local centrality, centrality and PageRank algorithm in random networks, small-world networks, and a scale-free network.",

The SIR model may be used to distinguish the types of infected users, with the assumption that none of them can be used simultaneously. The growth and decline of SNSs by using the SIR model were considered in (Tanaka et al., 2015) . Like the infectious disease spreads by people, and the infected people recover naturally, people who use SNSs are similar to infectious because they are driven by communicating with people. Thus, the SIR model can show the growth and decrease of SNS information. An information propagation model considering incomplete reading behavior in microblog was discussed in (Su et al., 2015) . Although many researchers use epidemic models like the SIR model to study information diffusion, such studies do not take the incomplete user's behavior. Thus, the model does not fit reality very well. This model also shows that the reading rate plays the most influential role in the information propagation performance in SNS. The interaction evolution model of mass incidents with delay in a social network was introduced in (Huo and Ma, 2017) . There are many studies that think the SIR model can be used to analyze the information diffusion model. However, this study believes it usually ignores considering time delay in the model. A discovery of pushing nodes in social networks based on the SIR model was presented in (Li and Zhang, 2016) . As for the SIR model, the probability of diffusion node plays an important role in information diffusion on SNS. When the probability is large enough, information can be easily spread throughout all social networks. In this discovery, it is concluded that when the probability is bigger than 0.7, the push of diffusion information is most effective. Therefore, it is vital to evaluate the different probability of social networks.",

The proposed approach has greatly been used in the evolutionary biology. In (Jackson and Yariv, 2007) , games are analyzed using the social networks in which the agent decides whether to participate or not in the actions (e.g. withdrawing the money from bank, taking active part in politics, adopting new technology). Different behaviors are analyzed and chosen the best response with respect to behavior of the last period. This approach involves the suggestions and applications to nancial, marketing, contagions, epidemiology and technology adoption. The characteristics of game theory model are shown in Table 7 .",

These researchers combined LDA modeling with this metric, which was named a self-adaptively LDA modeling method. The results showed that this model could reach the appropriate number of social topics without losing performance for data. Social Network Services such as Facebook and Twitter are popular these days. Such SNSMs are usually provided as a centralized model or a peer-to-peer model depending on the main objectives of the SNSMs. The authors in (Kosfeld, 2005) introduced a unified model that incorporates both the centralized and peer-to-peer models. In this model, there can be multiple servers owned by independent service providers and the servers communicate with each other to provide the SNS to the users. Due to the spread of unreliable online information on social network services (SNS), the users are faced with a difficult problem for determining if the information is trustworthy or not. The authors in (Thomas, 2007) proposed a model to evaluate the trustworthiness of information that is directly produced and distributed over the online network. It has trust metrics, called TII (Trust Index for Information on SNS), which is a criterion for measuring the trust degree of information on SNS. By this method, these researchers could estimate the social trust degree based on the variation of TII. The characteristic of a social networking service model is shown in Table 8 .",

However, these applications only deal with the strategic and rational behavior of each node rather than malicious behavior detection. In a mobile selforganizing network, nodes are essentially mobile. Thus, the collaboration between the mobile nodes in a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is more important. Thus, it is the biggest challenge facing all kinds of security attacks due to vulnerability. As a result, the network cannot operate safely while retaining its resources and implement security routing between nodes. To handle the security challenge, the Dynamic Bayesian Signaling Game (DBSG) is introduced to analyze the policy configuration of rule nodes and malicious nodes (Peddi et al., 2016) . The DBSG revealed the best behavior of individual strategies of each node. The conventional nodes should cooperate and update their earnings during routing, while malicious nodes take complex risks by assessing the risk. Shafigh et al. (2016) introduced a new user with certain types of wireless network terminals. The terminal are connected to the Internet at any time of the temporary access-point. The dynamic network architecture (DNA) model can be used to enhance the connectivity and capacity of ultra-dense wireless access networks without network infrastructure reconfiguration requirements.",

Opinion evolution and diffusion have been greatly facilitated by the rapid development of modern information technologies. Most influential users hold significant influence over a variety of topics. People's attitudes towards some products change from time to time. Information plays a vital role in how fashion spreads. Analyzing information diffusion models can help companies and advertisers designing more effective or popular products. For instance, the findings of some current studies (Thomas, 2007) suggest that SNS advertisers should make both the content of the banner ad and its outlook attractive, entertaining, absorbing and versatile. Companies can benefit from information diffusion on the target audience. Digital word-of-mouth marketing through the Internet can spread more widely and much faster at a significantly lower cost as compared to most if not all traditional methods (Nidhi Lal and Kumar, 2017) . Therefore, it is critical to further investigate the information diffusion models to make the right judgment before the advertising.",

The researchers propose Information-centric networkingbased framework over WBAN as the primary enabler for E-health applications. If users of wireless body area network (WBAN) use IP networks, they face many issues such as packet loss, security, etc (Sachdeva et al., xxxx) . The information-centric network (ICN) is proposed to solve such problems by exploitation of many advantages like efficient resource management, scalability, reduction of traffic, and security. ICN router has the caching capability to cache the contents. The researchers present the design and implementation of an Android-based application named ComFree for group-based coordination for information exchange in ad-hoc networks. The motive is to help users to exchange context-based information anytime anywhere without Internet connectivity using infrastructure-less Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANets) (Henze et al., 2014) . The application can be installed on mobile devices and a network can be set up on the fly like in a meeting or a conference.",

Another group of researchers uses questionnaires and other approaches to acquire data from the Internet in order to prove the correctness and rationality of their models. Therefore, how to combine reality and models to create a new one is a difficult task to achieve. To achieve such a complex task, we believe that further studies should focus more on the combinations of theoretical and practical aspects.",

Although there are reliable Internet databases with much information, obtaining real data is still a big challenge. It costs a large amount of money and takes a relatively long time to access the desired date. Due to the user's data privacy, many social websites set strict regulations that limit the free access to users' real data. Therefore, the solution to this problem needs collaboration between the academia and the related companies, which do not violate the privacy of users while at the same time support the research community with the required resources. There should also be a deployed multilevel agent-based model for calls to support several types of agents (Visheratin et al., 2016) .",

We also presented all research findings in the tabular form -providing a comprehensive analysis of different characteristics of each presented model. The results presented in this research demonstrate that social network models have improved over the years and become more realistic on applications. Moreover, we discussed the limitations of the existing models and identified the direction of future research.
