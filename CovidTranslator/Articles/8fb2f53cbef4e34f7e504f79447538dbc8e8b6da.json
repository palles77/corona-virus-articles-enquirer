            "text": "ORFan genes can constitute a large fraction of a bacterial genome, but due to their lack of homologs, their functions have remained largely unexplored. To determine if particular features of ORFan-encoded proteins promote their presence in a genome, we analyzed properties of ORFans that originated over a broad evolutionary timescale. We also compared ORFan genes to another class of acquired genes (HOPs), which have homologs in other bacteria. A total of 54 ORFan and HOP genes selected from different phylogenetic depths in the Escherichia coli lineage were cloned, expressed, purified and subjected to CD spectroscopy. A majority of genes could be expressed, but only 18 yielded sufficient soluble protein for spectral analysis. Of these, half were significantly \u03b1-helical, three were predominantly \u03b2-sheet, and six were of intermediate or indeterminate structure. Although a higher proportion of HOPs yielded soluble proteins with resolvable secondary structures, ORFans resembled HOPs with regard to most of the other features tested. Overall, we found that those ORFan and HOP genes that have persisted in the E. coli lineage were more likely to encode soluble and folded proteins, more likely to display environmental modulation of their gene expression, and by extrapolation, are more likely to be functional.",

Due to the very large number of sequenced genomes that are currently available, it is often possible to apply phylogenetic or similarity-based approaches to pinpoint the source and origins of acquired DNA [3, 4] . Whereas many foreign genes have counterparts in other organisms, bacterial genomes frequently contain lineage-, species-, strain-, or genome-specific genes, termed ORFans, that have no recognizable homologs in the current sequence databases [5, 6] . For example, the presence of over 500 strain-specific ORFan genes accounts for most of the difference in genome size between E. coli CFT073 and E. coli K12 [7, 8] . ORFan genes have been detected in virtually all sequenced organisms, and they can constitute up to 14% of the annotated genes in a bacterial genome [9] .",

One such hypothesis is the recurrent insertion of palindromic elements or domains into existing open reading frames resulting in genes that, due to complex sequence rearrangements, are beyond the detection limits of existing computational approaches [13, 14] . But, based on the sequence characteristics, it was proposed that ORFans represent genes principally of viral origin [6] , and a more recent study found that a small fraction of ORFans have viral gene homologs [8] . Moreover, the presence of mycobacterial ORFans in several mycobacteriophages further suggests that phage serve as vehicles for the origin, transfer and integration of these genes into bacterial genomes [15] .",

Many ORFan genes from E. coli and other species have been shown to be transcribed [16, 17, 18] . Recent studies on mimivirus proteomes revealed that more than 10% of the ORFan-encoded proteins display antigenic properties suggesting that many encode functional proteins [19] . The occurrence of putative transmembrane domains and repetitive sequences in several viral orphan proteins also indicates a possible role in metabolic exchange and nucleic acid interactions during host infections [20] . Moreover, orphan proteins contain large numbers of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine) resulting, in part, from the A+T-rich base composition in their coding sequences [21] . Interestingly, aromatic amino acids have been hypothesized to play some role in generating new protein functions as well as to stabilize protein structures by creating long hydrophobic aromatic side chains [22, 23, 24, 25] . But, because bacterial ORFans rarely exhibit significant sequence similarity to known proteins, and genome-wide mutagenesis studies have typically failed to assign phenotypes to the vast majority of ORFan genes [26] , their functions have remained elusive.",

For each gene in the E. coli MG1655 genome, those authors distinguished clade-specific (i) ORFans, which are genes assigned parsimoniously to a particular ancestral lineage and having no homologs outside of the descendents of this lineage, and (ii) HOPs (Heterogeneous Occurrence in Prokaryotes), which are genes that were assigned parsimoniously to a particular ancestral lineage and having homolog(s) in a bacterial genome outside of the descendents of this lineage (suggesting an origin by horizontal transfer). Because ORFans and HOPs can originate at any time over the evolutionary history of a lineage, their relative ages can be inferred from their phylogenetic distributions. For the present study, the target genes were selected from clades of different phylogenetic depths -clade n 0 , restricted to the E. coli MG1655 genome; n 1 , ancestral to all E. coli strains; n 2 , ancestral to E. coli and Salmonella enterica; n 3 , ancestral to all enteric bacteria -each representing a different origination time and duration within the gammaproteobacterial lineage leading to E. coli. (See Daubin and Ochman [6] for additional details). We selected genes ranging from approximately 400-800 bp in length and encoding protein products of 15-30 KDa, under the assumption that shorter genes, although conducive to CD spectral analysis, were more likely to represent annotation artifacts. Additionally, the context of genes was taken into consideration: we selected target genes that had different strand orientations and/or combinations of ORFans, HOPs or ancestral genes as neighbors.",

Cultures were induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1mM and grown at either 30\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 3 hours to allow expression of the target gene. After the induction period, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the resulting pellet was suspended in Buffer A (100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 [pH 8.0], 10 mM Tris, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride) and lysed by mechanical inversion for 1 hour. The lysate was then adjusted to 10 mM imidazole and centrifuged at 12000g for 15 minutes. Clear guanidine lysates were passed through Ni 2+ -NTA columns (Qiagen), which were washed twice with Buffer A supplemented with 10mM imidazole to prevent the non-specific binding of proteins. Target proteins were eluted with 0.6 ml of Buffer F (200 mM acetic acid, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride). The purified proteins were refolded by dialysis into 100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 buffer (pH 7.0) supplemented with 3mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol to reduce the formation of disulphide bonds. Dialyzed proteins were centrifuged at 12000g for 15 minutes to separate soluble protein from precipitates. A minimum of 600 \u03bcl of supernatant fraction containing soluble refolded protein were recovered after renaturation by dialysis for each sample. The amount of soluble refolded protein in the supernatant fractions ranged from 0.03 mg/ml (yabP) to 1.43 mg/ml (paaD). When necessary, proteins were concentrated using centrifugal filters with a cutoff value of 5 kDa (Millipore). Relative amounts of precipitated and soluble protein were assessed by running volume-equalized pellet and supernatant samples on 12% SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Blue. The concentration of soluble protein was measured on a CARY 50 spectrophotometer. Molar extinction coefficients (\u03b5 280 ) were calculated based on the number of tryptophan residues (5559 cm \u22121 per residue) plus the number of tyrosine residues (1197 cm \u22121 per residue).

Although there are large numbers of genes that cannot be cloned or expressed at high copy-numbers because they are deleterious to their E. coli host [36, 37, 38] , all of the ORFan genes we tested were already constituents of the E. coli MG1655 genome, and the expression of each native locus has been observed under some growth condition. Using quantitative PCR, we verified that several of the ORFan genes generated high levels of mRNA when grown at different conditions. That said, in surveying the conditions that might regulate the expression of ORFan genes, a survey of available microarray data shows that five of the 14 ORFan genes that did not yield proteins never showed differential expression under any condition tested [39, 40] . In contrast, those ORFan genes for which we were able to isolate proteins had a higher probability of being differentially expressed, indicating that they are likely produced (and useful) during some stage of the E. coli life cycle. It should be noted that over half of the ORFan genes examined were induced during adaptation to glucose-limiting conditions [41, 42] . Thus, we were more likely to recover proteins from ORFan genes whose regulation had previously been shown to be modulated by some environmental variable.",

We examined the nearest neighbors of each of the cloned ORFan genes with the thought that ORFans that reside next to and transcribed in the same strand orientation as an ancestral gene would be more likely to produce stable proteins because they do not require their own promoter to drive transcription. Neither the ancestry of adjacent genes nor the orientation of an ORFan gene relative to its neighbors provided clues about our ability to isolate protein from a particular gene. Those ORFans situated immediately downstream of ancestral genes were as likely as not to produce proteins in our system; and although most ORFan genes were aligned in the same orientation as their upstream genes, in three of the eight cases where they were in opposite direction, we were able to recover proteins for structural analysis ( Table 1 ).",

Thus, the expression of ORFan genes, as a group, may differ substantially from the rest of the genome, and the difference in expressability may be attributable to the fact that (i) the genes in our study were chosen without regard to their status as membrane proteins, (ii) the unusual base compositions of ORFans genes might result in an increased high metabolic cost to the host, and (iii) some ORFan proteins could not be extracted by traditional lysis procedures (6M guanidine).",

Because larger proteins are more difficult to refold, the overall lower rate of refolding success of ORFan and HOP proteins (58% in the present study vs. 55-88% observed by Maxwell et al.

It must also be noted, however, that expressed proteins which fail to refold in a soluble form from denaturant solutions may also be perfectly functional in vivo. First, some proteins that are insoluble in physiological buffers may be associated with cell membranes and in the two cases for which functions have been assigned to ORFan genes producing insoluble proteins, one (yafO) encodes a toxin, and the other (ompX) encodes an outer member protein implicated in adhesion and virulence [45, 46, 47] . Second, some proteins may be soluble in their native form, but undergo nonnative aggregation and precipitation in competition with correct refolding during dialysis from guanidine. Failure of soluble proteins to refold correctly in vitro may be due to the absence of protein folding modulators, such as chaperones and proteases, that may be necessary to ensure proper folding, stabilization and solubilization in vivo [48, 49, 50, 51] . In short, refoldability is one observation in favor of a protein being functional, but it is by no means a necessary precondition.",

A previous study focusing on insoluble hypothetical proteins from Thermotoga maritima and Saccharomyces cerevisiae reported that approximately 50% of the proteins with well-resolved CD spectra corresponded to an \u03b1-helical structure, whereas only 9-25% corresponded to \u03b2-sheet configurations [44] . A broad survey of the SP175 CD spectra reference database (http://pcddb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk) showed that proteins with \u03b2-sheet structures are twice as common as \u03b1-helical proteins [55] . However, Wolf et al. [56] and Hegyi et al. [57] note that \u03b2-sheet proteins are most commonly involved in regulation and signal transduction, and are generally more highly abundant in eukaryotes than in bacteria. Thus, the dearth of predominantly \u03b2-sheet protein structures in our study could be attributable to the size class of proteins that we investigated, the emphasis of the present study on prokaryotic proteins, and even an increased probability for \u03b1-helical proteins to refold from guanidine [58] . It should also be noted that some of the proteins classed as \u03b1helical in our study may also contain substantial \u03b2-sheet structure that is masked by the helical signal, which tends to dominate the spectrum. For example, protein YbiA (categorized as significantly \u03b1-helical in our study) for which the NMR structure has been solved (PDB code: 2B3W), has some \u03b2-sheet though it is mainly dominated by \u03b1-helix structure. Furthermore, our CD spectral observation on protein AllA (predominantly \u03b2sheet) correlated with crystallographic studies which revealed the protein to be of \u03b2-sheet structure [59] .",

As a class, HOPs encode longer proteins (Daubin and Ochman [6] ), but in the present study, we selected HOPs that averaged approximately the same length as ORFans.",

In addition, recovery of soluble and partially soluble HOP proteins for structural studies was much higher (73% vs. 44%). But for most of the other features that we tested, HOPs resembled ORFans. Like ORFans, gene context and orientation had no apparent affect on the expression of cloned HOPs. Furthermore, of the HOP proteins for which the CD spectra were obtained, the majority were from older clades (n 2 and n 3 ). Finally, structural analysis revealed that approximately half of the HOP proteins that yielded CD spectra had significant amounts of \u03b1-helical structure, which agrees with that observed for ORFan proteins and for proteins of this size class in general [44] .",

Of the total of 54 genes cloned, nearly 60% could be expressed and 18 produced refoldable, soluble proteins that yielded CD spectra resembling structures of folded proteins. Our data support the notion that many ORFans are indeed real genes and encode folded and probably functional proteins, despite their lack of clear conserved homologs. A recent study focusing on the poorly conserved paralogs in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 found that nearly 80% of the genes tested were transcriptionally active, indicating that these genes might encode true proteins [18] . Interestingly, it seems that many ORFans, even those that have persisted for long evolutionary time spans, are likely to encode proteins that have truly novel folded structures with unique functions or to correspond to rapidly evolving known protein folds of similar functions [5, 62] . Large scale initiatives aimed at revealing the structure and function of proteins present in Mycoplasma have not only assigned structure-based functions for the majority of the hypothetical proteins but also revealed that nearly 50% of the ORFans tested had unique folds [63] .",

And one such protein, nsp1, which is presumed to be involved in mRNA degradation, was shown to have an irregular \u03b2-barrel fold that was previously unknown among proteins involved in this biological function [65] . Thus, it could be that ORFans also have a role in basic cellular processes but perform these functions by unique mechanisms. Although it is not possible to define and characterize new structures based solely on CD spectral analysis, future studies focusing on NMR and X-ray crystallography of ORFan proteins, in association with these resolved spectra, can potentially yield distinctive novel folds.",
