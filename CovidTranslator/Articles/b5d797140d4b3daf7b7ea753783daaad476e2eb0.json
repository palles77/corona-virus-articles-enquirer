The BCF-Kita genome is a unique complex recombinant A-F-G-H-K-U strain. These data support previous observations of the complexity of strains originating from the DRC.

Brun-Vezinet (H\u00f4 pital Bichat-Claude Bernard, France) to the NED (NIH-European Network for Virology Assurance-DoD, U.S. Military HIV Program) panel, were characterized further. This panel was developed in 1996 to serve as a reference panel of well-characterized but minimally passaged HIV-1 strains, with diverse geographic origins 1 and sequence diversity. The isolates were obtained, for the most part, prior to widespread use of antiretroviral therapy and should therefore be considered to be sensitive to antiretroviral therapies. The BCF-Kita isolate was from an asymptomatic individual living in France who was originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and was believed to be infected in the DRC before arrival in France. BCF-Dioum was isolated in France during a primary infection from a person whose HIV-positive partner was from the DRC, and believed to be infected in the DRC before arrival in France. The isolates were identified as belonging to subtypes G (BCF-Dioum) and H (BCF-Kita) by heteroduplex analysis (HMA) of an envelope (env) gene fragment, prior to donation to the panel. Our previous sequence analysis of the protease and partial reverse tran-scriptase (RT) genes (1190 bases) showed that these strains contain areas suggesting F=G and A=G recombination, respectively. 2 Further sequencing and evaluation of the near full-length genomes now show that these strains are complex intersubtype recombinants.",

A consensus sequence for each strain was generated using Autoassembler v. 2.0.1 (AB), which assembled and aligned the chromatographs for all the forward and reverse sequence data contiguously. Parameters in the assemblage program were set at 50 bases for the minimum overlap size with a 70% similarity for the smaller sequenced regions for each piece to be added into the consensus. The editing strategy of the aligned, overlapping sequences required that each called base show the same unambiguous or mixed peak composition in both the forward and reverse direction for inclusion into the overall consensus sequence. Since the sequences were generated by population sequencing, no attempt to resolve mixed bases was made if both bases were represented as comigrating peaks in both directions. Each new major region that was sequenced had to include an unambiguous overlap into an existing region of the current consensus sequence. The final consensus sequences for BCF-Dioum and BCF-Kita were then aligned with the Sequence Locator Tool in the Los Alamos HIV database (http:==hiv.lanl.gov) to map the genome regions and corresponding proteins against the reference strain HXB2. To generate phylogenetic trees, the consensus genome sequence of either BCF-Dioum or BCF-Kita was added to alignments composed of randomly chosen HIV-1 nonrecombinant reference sequences from the Los Alamos HIV database, including group O sequences. For the BCF-Dioum tree, sequences for seven CRF06_cpx strains were added; for the BCF-Kita tree, two G-K-U recombinant strains 5 were added. The alignments made within the module were downloaded in FASTA format, checked for quality of alignment, and gapstripped for analysis. These alignments were also examined in SimPlot version 3.5.1. 6, 7 The similarity (SimPlot) and bootscanning (Bootscan) plots were made using the F84 model with a window size of 400 bases.",

It covers up to the first 198 amino acids of gp41. Analysis with the NCBI genotyping tool showed no clear association with any single identified subtype or circulating recombinant form (data not shown). Phylogenetic analysis of the entire sequence shows the BCF-Kita did not map with any specific subtype. However, the strain did appear on the same node as two G-K-U recombinant strains, SE 8646 and SE9019, 5 both isolated in 1995 (Fig. 1B) . These genomes also represent complex, but as yet unclassified recombinants originating from Uganda and the DRC, respectively. They also show sizable regions that suggest some relationship with subtypes A1 and H. 5 A more detailed phylogenetic evaluation of the subtype composition of the BCF-Kita genome was made by splitting the genome alignment into smaller segments of variable size between visible breakpoints, as described above. The portions of the trees containing BCF-Kita made from these alignments are shown in Fig. 2A . Cumulatively, these data indicate that the strain is distinctly a group M intersubtype recombinant and is composed of regions with some similarity to subtypes A-F-G-H-K and some regions which are not significantly related to any one defined subtype and are classified here as U (Untypeable). The two U regions, between bases 4253-4502 in integrase and 7204-7406 near the 3 0 end of gp120, may be a mix of two or more subtypes that are not clearly distinguishable or derived from an individual subtype that has not yet been described. The map of BCF-Kita generated from these trees using the recombinant HIV-1 drawing tool (http:==hiv.lanl.gov) is shown in Fig. 2B . The major portion of the env gene is mostly like subtype H, which would support the original observation placing this strain into this group by HMA analysis. Breakpoints in major gene regions appear in the p24 gene, protease, RT, which has two clear crossover points, RNase H, integrase, vpr, and gp120. The pol gene contained breakpoints similar, but not identical to, patterns mapped for several other designated CRF_cpx strains originating from Central and West Africa and Cypress and Greece (http:==hiv.lanl.gov).

Duchet et al. 16 reported gag (accession number Y13196) and env (accession number Y13197) sequences for this isolate, showing gag to have an A=G subtype composition and env to be subtype H, making the strain an A=G=H recombinant. The gag and env sequences show 97% and 94% DNA sequence identity, respectively, to corresponding areas of the BCF-Kita genome. It is also of interest that BCF-Kita branches on the same node as the untyped G-K-U isolates SE8646 and SE9010 (Fig. 1B) , displaying, in alignment, overall homologies of 91% and 90%, respectively.

The strains were contributed to the panel as representatives of subtype G and H, respectively, which was appropriate based on the assay used to determine their subtype. Because the strains were passaged in culture, it is highly likely that any diversity that might have been noted in the original plasma was reduced or lost. This is demonstrated by the low level of ambiguity that appeared during sequencing. Their genomic profiles provide an example that considerations about the entire genome should to be made when using these strains or when collecting strains for other subtype ''reference'' panels for activities such as assay validation or devel- opment. This is reinforced by the observation that the areas in which breakpoints were noted for these strains, such as p24, RT, and integrase, are targets for diagnostic use and=or therapy. It may be that different levels of characterization of sets of new isolates would need to be performed based on anticipated use of the samples. Studies, assays, and reagents made using BCF-Dioum and BCF-Kita should take into account the complexity noted in their genomes.",

The subtypes were identified through heteroduplex mapping and sequencing of the env and gag portions of the genome. Although subtype A was predominant, all other subtypes except subtype B were prevalent in the region, including several complex recombinants. Notably, 29% of the samples showed discordance between env and gag analysis, reinforcing the high probable incidence of recombinants in the circulating populations in the DRC. Yang et al.15 examined 24 samples collected in 1985 and 83 samples obtained between 1999 and 2000 evaluating the p24 region of gag and the C2V3 and gp41 regions of env. Their analysis also indicated extensive subtype mixing occurring during both time periods.

The alignments corresponding to regions between the crossover points were evaluated further in PHYLIP modules DNADIST and NEIGHBOR. The trees were produced using Treeview. Boot strap values were determined using PHYLIP modules in the following order: SEQBOOT, DNADIST, NEIGHBOR, and CONSENSE. The portions of the total alignment with tree branches containing BCF-Kita are shown. The subtype of the reference strains in the alignments are represented by the first letter of the name of the strain. The regions represented in each alignment portion are designated by HXB2 base pair (bp) numbering at the bottom of each small panel. The position of BCF-Kita in each panel is marked with an arrow. The subtype of group M that best matches the region containing BCF-Kita is shown to the right of each panel. Subtype U designates an untyped region.
