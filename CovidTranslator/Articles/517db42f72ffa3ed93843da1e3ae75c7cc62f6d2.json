This plan must be supported by a transparent central system for tracking and monitoring the results of these resource fl ows. Additionally, all governments must agree to regular, independent, external assessment of their core capacities. \u2022 Recommendation 2: WHO should promote early reporting of outbreaks by commending countries that rapidly and publicly share information, while publishing lists of countries that delay reporting. Funders should create economic incentives for early reporting by committing to disburse emergency funds rapidly to assist countries when outbreaks strike and compensating for economic losses that might result. Additionally, WHO must confront governments that implement trade and travel restrictions without scientifi c justifi cation, while developing industry-wide cooperation frameworks to ensure private fi rms such as airlines and shipping companies continue to provide crucial services during emergencies.",

We need it now.N aimah Jackson, Team Leader, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res Ebola Treatment Center, Monrovia. Address to the UN Security Council, Sept 18, 2014 1 The west African Ebola epidemic that began in 2013 was a human tragedy that exposed a global community altogether unprepared to help some of the world's poorest countries control a lethal outbreak of infectious disease. The outbreak engendered acts of outstanding courage and solidarity, but also immense human suff ering, fear, and chaos, largely unchecked by high-level political leadership or reliable and rapid institutional responses. The outbreak continues as of November, 2015. It has infected more than 28 000 people and claimed more than 11 000 lives, 2 brought national health systems to a halt, rolled back hard-won social and economic gains in a region recovering from civil wars, sparked worldwide panic, and cost several billion dollars in short-term control eff orts and economic losses. 3, 4 Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone were most badly aff ected. The Ebola outbreak is a stark reminder of the fragility of health security in an interdependent world, and of the importance of building a more robust global system to protect all people from such risks. 5 A more humane, competent, and timely response to future outbreaks needs greater willingness to assist aff ected populations, and systematic investments to enable the global community to perform four key functions: 1. Strengthen core capacities within and between countries to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks when and where they occur. 2. Mobilise faster and more eff ective external assistance when countries are unable to prevent an outbreak from turning into a crisis. 3. Rapidly produce and widely share relevant know ledge, from community mobilisation strategies to protective measures for health workers, and from epidemiological information to rapid diagnostic tests. 4. Provide stewardship over the whole system, entailing strong leadership, coordination, priority-setting, and robust accountability from all involved. 6 The Ebola outbreak emphasised failures in performing all four of these functions. Clarity about roles, responsibilities, and rules-and accountability for adherence to them-is essential in a complex system that must involve local, national, regional, and international actors spanning the public, private, and non-profi t sectors. Yet, this clarity and accountability was fundamentally absent. Without addressing these governance issues, we will remain wholly unprepared for the next epidemic, which might very well be more devastating, virulent, and transmissible than Ebola or previous disease outbreaks. [7] [8] [9] The Independent Panel on the Global Response to Ebola is a joint initiative of the Harvard Global Health Institute and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine to review the global community's response to the Ebola outbreak. The 19 members come from academia, think tanks and civil society around the world, with expertise in Ebola, disease outbreaks, public and global health, international law, development and humanitarian assistance, and national and global governance. The Panel took a global, system-wide view with a special focus on rules, roles, and responsibilities to identify changes necessary to prevent and prepare for future outbreaks.",

This phase underscored the problem of inadequate investments in health infrastructure, despite national governments' formal commitments to do so under the International Health Regulations (2005), 11 and awareness among donors that many lower income countries would need substantial external support.

That month, both Guinea and Liberia confi rmed Ebola outbreaks to WHO. By March 24, Ebola was confi rmed in Conakry, home to more than one in seven Guineans. Two months later Ebola had spread to three capital cities with international airports. Without any approved drugs, vaccines or rapid diagnostic tests, health workers struggled to diagnose patients and provide eff ective care. Without suffi cient protective gear, and initially without widespread understanding of the virus, hundreds of health workers themselves became ill and died. Despite M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res' warnings about the unprecedented scope of the outbreak, 12 national authorities in Guinea downplayed it for fear of creating panic and disrupting economic activity. 12, 13 Internal documents 14 suggest similar concerns might have infl uenced WHO, which publicly characterised the outbreak in March as \"relatively small still\". 15 WHO's Global Alert and Response Network sent an expert team to support national eff orts, as did others such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, those teams withdrew from Guinea and Liberia in May when reported cases decreased, even as viral transmission continued. 16 In late May, Sierra Leone became the third country to declare an Ebola outbreak to WHO. For the fi rst time in the known history of Ebola, the virus had spawned sustained outbreaks in three countries. This should have raised substantial alarm, as coordination was weak between the national governments of Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, the borders extremely porous, and human movement and trade highly fl uid. In late June, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res labelled the situation as \"out of control\" and publicly called for more international attention and resources. 17 This second phase witnessed three interrelated failures. First, in a failure of political leadership, some national authorities did not call for greater international assistance despite the humanitarian crisis, and in some cases downplayed the outbreak. Second, WHO's in-country technical capacity was weak, shown by its decision to withdraw its international team too soon and its poor responses in Guinea and Sierra Leone to requests for technical guidance from ministries of health and health-care providers. 18, 19 Third, WHO did not mobilise global assistance in countering the epidemic despite ample evidence the outbreak had overwhelmed national and non-governmental capacities-failures in both technical judgment and political leadership.",

            "text": "The third phase began in July as cases, global attention, panic, and responses all grew. Funding increased, with the World Bank committing US$200 million in the fi rst major external fi nancing response. 20 Media attention and public interest substantially increased after the evacuation of two infected US aid workers from Liberia. 21 Fear and hysteria in response to Ebola infections in the USA later led to quarantines of returning aid workers and other measures counterproductive for controlling the epidemic. 22 Dozens of countries, private companies, and universities began implementing travel restrictions, and many airlines ceased fl ying into the region. 23 On Aug 7, WHO convened the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, and the next day the Director-General offi cially designated the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (\"an extraordinary event which is determined...to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.\" 11 ) Detected cases grew expon entially. Ebola treatment centres in all three countries were stretched beyond capacity and forced to turn away patients at their gates. 12 A growing lack of trust between population groups and government authorities hindered community mobilisation and public education. 24 In the ensuing weeks, the global community mobilised, with new commitments of fi nancing, health personnel, and logistical support from the African Union, China, Cuba, the European Union, the UK, the USA, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the UN agencies. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 2177 declaring the outbreak a threat to international peace and security, the only time it has done so regarding an outbreak and only the second resolution ever (after HIV/AIDS in 2000) to focus on a disease. 25 The UN Secretary General created a new entity to coordinate the international response, the UN Mission for Emergency Ebola Response. 26 Additionally, trials for two candidate vaccines were launched in Europe and the USA, and WHO convened an expert group to develop guidance for the ethics of using experimental therapies. 27 Despite increased mobilisation of political attention and resources, this third phase witnessed several failures. First, public and private restrictions on trade and travel further harmed an already suff ering region and hindered control eff orts. 16, 28 Second, the operational response commenced slowly, taking months for funding, personnel, and other resources to reach the region. [28] [29] [30] Third, the creation of the UN Mission for Emergency Ebola Response bypassed the pre-existing UN body for emergency coordination, the Offi ce for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aff airs, further blurring the lines of responsibility for international coordination. Fourth, fi eld staff often reinvented strategies for community mobilisation and contact tracing because relevant lessons from previous Ebola outbreaks in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo were not eff ectively transferred. 31 Fifth, international staff with Ebola sometimes received experimental therapies (albeit, the effi cacy and risks of which were unknown) and were evacuated while national staff largely were not, a demoralising and often deadly distinction for many health workers. 32, 33 Sixth, there was poor understanding of how to take into account community beliefs, practices, and solutions, properly address rumours, and involve local leaders-with sometimes fatal consequences for health workers and communities. 34 A fourth phase began towards the end of 2014 as the epidemic turned a corner. The total number of cases began to decline in the hardest hit countries as community leaders and organisations joined control eff orts, even before large-scale global assistance arrived. Ebola had been imported into Nigeria, Mali, and Senegal in the second half of 2014. Nevertheless, rapid information sharing, and mobilisation of health workers for contact tracing and patient care had limited the outbreak in Senegal to one confi rmed infection. 35 In Nigeria, the Nigerian Center for Disease Control, previous experience with polio eradication eff orts and a lead poisoning emergency were all cited as important factors in successful control of the outbreak in Africa's most populous country. 36 By the end of January, 2015, more than $5 billion had been committed for the Ebola response (although the proportion of these funds actually spent on Ebola and in the aff ected countries remains unclear). 37 Research and development eff orts were quickly operationalised despite uncertainty on processes for regulatory approval, with at least three vaccine candidates, three blood products, and fi ve drug candidates in clinical trials, with WHO playing a coordinating role. 38 During this phase, the binding constraints were no longer political attention, funding, or human resources, but operational coordination, accountability for eff ective use of funds, and maintaining momentum to prevent new infections.",

Further analysis is needed to estimate the required level of additional funding. Strategic investments for International Health Regulation core capacities can and should also strengthen broader health systems. 7,60 For example, health information systems can support surveillance and monitoring of outbreaks and routine health services; training and payment of community health workers and civil society service providers can help achieve universal health coverage, while providing an essential trained workforce during emergencies. Additionally, regional and subregional actors should develop capacities to supplement gaps at the national level. For example, in Africa, national governments, the African Development Bank, and other donors should invest in the infrastructural backbone for a network of laboratories, information systems, and training of African national emergency responders based in centres of excellence. The Pan American Health Organization has shown the feasibility of a regional network of centres for disease control, and building such a network could be a central task of the proposed African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

WHO publicly challenged China's Government to be more transparent about SARS, showing the organisation's potential political power. WHO should also publicly disclose lists of countries that implement trade and travel restrictions when WHO Temporary Recommendations advise against them and countries that do not provide a science or public health rationale for such measures (as required by the International Health Regulations). Doing so will require a delicate balancing act between WHO's role as trusted interlocutor with governments on sensitive outbreak-related information, and its role as guardian of the International Health Regulations.

A systematic way of posing and answering operational research questions, such as the relative merits of using intravenous fl uids for patient care, would also have strengthened the response. Furthermore, WHO provided valuable technical leadership about the ethics of using unproven therapies, but little guidance on how strictly limited quantities of drugs should be rationed. West African health workers and patients were largely denied access to the stocks sometimes available to international staff . 79 In several instances, WHO proved its capacity to lead, convene, coordinate, and establish norms among a broad range of public and private actors on research and development and data sharing. Additionally to its guidance about experimental therapies, WHO convened research and development actors in mid-2014 and late-2014, and again at a global Ebola research and development summit in May, 2015. In July, 2015, WHO also issued guidance about accelerating regulatory approval of technologies in emergencies. WHO also convened a meeting in September, 2015, to build norms for open data sharing as part of an eff ort to develop a \"blueprint\" to guide the collective research and development eff orts of industry and governments for emergencies. These successful eff orts should be institutionalised to better govern knowledge production and sharing in future outbreaks.",

Responding eff ectively to outbreaks demands much stronger operational capacity within WHO and within the broader aid system if outbreaks escalate into humanitarian emergencies, a politically protected process for WHO's emergency declarations, and strong mechanisms for the accountability of all involved actors, from national governments to non-governmental organisations and from UN agencies to the private sector. Mobilisation of the knowledge needed to combat outbreaks will require an international framework of rules to enable, govern, and ensure access to the benefi ts of research, and fi nancing to develop technology when commercial incentives are inappropriate. Finally, eff ective governance of this complex global system demands high-level political leadership and a WHO that is more focused and appropriately fi nanced and whose credibility is restored through the implementation of good governance reforms and assertive leadership.",

            "text": "The human catastrophe of the Ebola epidemic that began in 2013 shocked the world's conscience and created an unprecedented crisis. It exposed deep inadequacies in the national and international institutions responsible for protecting the public from the far-reaching human, social, economic and political consequences of disease outbreaks. The reputation and credibility of WHO has suff ered a particularly fi erce blow. Ebola brought to the forefront a central question: is major reform of international institutions feasible to restore confi dence and prevent future catastrophes? Or should leaders conclude the system is beyond repair and take ad hoc measures when the next major outbreak strikes? Research: producing and sharing data, knowledge, and technology 6. Develop a framework of rules to enable, govern, and ensure access to the benefi ts of research 7. Establish a global facility to fi nance, accelerate, and prioritise research and development Governing the global system 8. Sustain high-level political attention through a Global Health Committee of the Security Council 9. A new deal for a more focused, appropriately fi nanced WHO 10. Good governance of WHO through decisive, time bound reform and assertive leadership International Health Regulation Emergency Committee. The Standing Emergency Committee will meet and receive information from the Emergency Centre regularly, with the mandate to declare a public health emergency of international concern by a majority vote of its members. The Director-General would chair this committee. A permanent Inspector General's offi ce is proposed, along with other good governance reforms (not depicted in the fi gure) such as a freedom of information policy. After diffi cult and lengthy deliberation, our Panel concluded major reforms are warranted and feasible. The Panel refi ned its recommendations into a roadmap of ten interrelated reforms that in combination can strengthen the global system for outbreak prevention and response.",
