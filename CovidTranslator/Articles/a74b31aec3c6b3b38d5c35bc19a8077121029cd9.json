H5N1 was first isolated from a patient in Hong Kong in 1997 [1] . Since then, H5N1 has circulated in birds and spread to large parts of the world, with sporadic human infections. By March 11, 2009 , 411 cases of human infection with H5N1 have been reported, 256 of which were fatal, with a cumulative case fatality rate of 62% (http://www.who. int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_ 2009_03_11/en/index.html). Since there are no effective drugs or vaccines for this infection, health professionals from the WHO and the CDC believe the question is not if we are going to have another avian influenza pandemic, but when it will occur [2, 3] .",

While some viruses do not need endocytosis for entry, most are likely to use one or more of the various pathways of endocytosis. It has now been proven that the endocytic pathways that viruses can em-ploy include: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae/lipid rafts-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and a non-clathrin-, non-caveolae-dependent endocytosis, which is not well defined [4, 5] . Among these pathways, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the most commonly observed uptake pathway for viruses. After binding to its receptors, the virus is sequestered into clathrincoated pits, internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis in clathrin-coated vesicles and delivered to endosomes, where the virus will penetrate in the acidic milieu [6, 7] .",

The mechanism of influenza vi-rus entry has been widely studied; however, all the studies have been carried out with virus strain H1N1, and most of the studies have used the canine kidney cell line MDCK. It has been reported that the influenza virus can enter cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis [8, 9] , caveolae-mediated endocytosis [9, 10] , or non-clathrin-, non-caveolae-dependent endocytosis [11] , depending on the different cell lines or virus strains used. However, since the risk of an H5N1 pandemic is increasing due to the widespread occurrence of birds infected with H5N1 and the lack of effective drugs or vaccines, it is imperative to understand the mechanism of the disease caused by H5N1 in humans. In this study, we used the H5N1 strain and a cell line from human lung tissue, the main target of H5N1 infection, and found that the H5N1 virus can enter a human lung carcinoma cell line via clathrindependent endocytosis.",

Therefore, the endocytic pathway is usually thought to be pH-sensitive while the direct membrane fusion pathway is usually pH-independent. To determine whether the H5N1induced cell death is related to endocytosis, we pretreated A549 cells with lysosomotropic agents, which elevated the pH of acidic organelles, thus blocking endocytosis.

CPZ can cause clathrin to assemble on endosomal membranes and prevent the assembly of coated pits at the cell surface, thus inhibiting clathrinmediated endocytosis [17] . We found that pretreatment of A549 cells with CPZ could rescue H5N1-induced cell death ( Figure 3A) , which suggests that clathrin may be involved in this process.",

To further confirm the role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we next used a more specific siRNA approach. As mentioned above, clathrin functions as a triskelion, a three-legged structure, that is assembled by three heavy chains each with an associated light chain [18] . Knockdown of the heavy chain with siRNA has been proven to be an effective and specific method to assay the role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis [12, 19, 20] . We used two siRNAs against CHC to determine the role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Western blots showed that both siRNAs can efficiently knockdown the CHC protein ( Figure 3C and D) . Addi-tionally, both siRNA treatments significantly enhanced cell viability after treatment with inactivated H5N1 ( Figure 3B ). All of these results suggest that H5N1 can enter A549 cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis.",

Figure 4A shows that, compared with mock-treated A549 cells in which the CTB was internalized within cells, all the drug-treated cells showed inhibited CTB uptake in which the CTBs were clustered on the cell surface, indicating that these drugs work very well on A549 cells.
