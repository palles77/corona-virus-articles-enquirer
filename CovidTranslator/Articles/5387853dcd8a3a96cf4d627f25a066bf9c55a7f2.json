IL-27 functions through IL-27R and has been shown to have potent anti-tumor activity via activation of a variety of cellular components, including anti-tumor CD8 + T-cell responses. However, the exact mechanisms of how IL-27 enhances anti-tumor CD8 + T-cell responses remain unclear. Here we show that IL-27 significantly enhances the survival of activated tumor antigen specific CD8 + T cells in vitro and in vivo, and programs tumor antigen-specific CD8 + T cells into memory precursor (MPC)-like effector cells, characterized by upregulation of Bcl-6, SOCS3, Sca-1, and IL-10. While STAT3 activation and the CTL survival-enhancing effects can be independent of CTL IL-10 production, we show here that IL-27-induced CTL IL-10 production contributes to MPC phenotype induction, CTL memory, and tumor rejection. Thus, IL-27 enhances anti-tumor CTL responses via programming tumor antigen-specific CD8 + T cells into a unique memory precursor-type of effector cells characterized by a greater survival advantage. Our results have important implications for designing immunotherapy against human cancer.",

The enhancing roles of endogenous IL-27 in the generation of anti-tumor CTL responses were also demonstrated using IL-27R\u03b1-deficient mice [11] [12] . Although these studies provide a strong case for the role of IL-27 in inducing anti-tumor CTL responses, it remains unclear how IL-27 enhances anti-tumor CTL responses.

The role of IL-10 in tumor immunity is often controversial with increasing evidence supporting a positive role in the induction of anti-tumor CTL response. For instance, in IL-10-deficient mice, anti-tumor CTL responses were weakened [17] and increased numbers of FoxP3 + Treg cells were found [18] ; whereas in IL-10 transgenic mice, anti-tumor CTL responses were primed and shown to be responsible for tumor rejection [17, 19] . Since IL-27 directly stimulates CD8 + T-cell differentiation and promotes CTL IL-10 production, we hypothesize that these functions of IL-27 are involved in IL-27-mediated anti-tumor CTL response and tumor rejection. In the present study, we sought to test this hypothesis by using our wellestablished animal models. We have found that IL-27 significantly enhances the survival of activated tumor antigen specific CD8 + T cells in vitro and in vivo and induces a unique memory precursor (MPC) phenotype in tumor antigen-specific CD8 + T cells, characterized by up-regulation of Bcl-6, SOCS3, Sca-1, and IL-10. While STAT3 activation and the CTL survival-enhancing effects can be independent of CTL IL-10 production, we show here that IL-27-mediated CTL IL-10 production contributes to MPC phenotype induction, CTL memory, and tumor rejection.",

Cell numbers were counted every 24 hours for a period of 5 days. As shown in Fig.1A , P1CTL cells stimulated with IL-27 yielded significantly higher numbers of viable cells compared to cells stimulated with P1A peptide alone. To determine if IL-27 affects the survival of activated P1CTL cells, the cultured P1CTL cells were stained for Annexin V and 7-AAD to quantify cell apoptosis over time. The addition of IL-27 resulted in substantially reduced cell apoptosis of activated P1CTL cells (Fig.1B) .

Tumor infiltrating P1CTL cells from J558-IL-27 tumors also underwent less apoptosis compared with cells from J558-ctrl tumors (Fig.1E ).

As shown in Fig.3A and quantified in Fig.3B , starting on day 3, high numbers of IL-10 + IFN-\u03b3and IL-10 + IFN-\u03b3 + cells were detected in IL-27-stimulated WT P1CTL cells (Fig.3A , first row), while IL-10 + cells were undetectable in WT P1CTL cells in the absence of IL-27 (Fig.3A , second row), or in activated IL-10 -/-P1CTLs in the presence or absence of IL-27 (Fig.3A , third and fourth rows). Consistent with this observation, IL-10 mRNA expression was elevated more than 15 times in IL-27-stimulated WT P1CTLs relative to other cultures (Fig.3C ). Increased concentration of IL-10 protein in the culture supernatant from IL-27-stimulated WT P1CTLs was also detected (Fig.3D ). IL-27 stimulation resulted in slightly reduced numbers of IFN\u03b3 + cells (Fig.3A, Fig.3B ), reduced IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression (Fig.3C) , and reduced amounts of IFN-\u03b3 secretion into the culture supernatants ( Fig.3D ) in both WT and IL-10 -/-P1CTLs. Since IL-27 equally inhibited IFN-\u03b3 production in WT and IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells, it is likely that the down-regulation of IFN-\u03b3 by IL-27 is IL-10 independent. However, IL-27differentiated P1CTL and IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells showed similar cytotoxicity to P1A antigen positive P815 cells (Fig.3E ).",

Spleen and lymph node cells from IL-10 -/-P1CTL mice were stimulated with P1A peptide in the presence or absence of IL-27, and the numbers of viable cells were counted once a day for a period of 5 days. As shown in Fig.4A , IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells cultured with IL-27 resulted in significantly higher numbers of viable cells compared with cells stimulated with P1A peptide alone. To determine if IL-27 affects the survival of activated IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells, cultured IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells were stained for Annexin V and 7-AAD to quantify cell death over time. The addition of IL-27 resulted in significantly reduced cell death of activated IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells (Fig.4B ). Similar results were obtained when purified CD8 + T cells from IL-10 -/-P1CTL mice were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and IL-27 (not shown). These results suggest that IL-27 provides a survival advantage to activated IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells. To test if IL-27 stimulates IL-10 -/-P1CTL cell expansion in vivo, we injected IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells into Rag-2 -/mice bearing established tumors of similar size. Four days later, more IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells were detected in the tumors and spleens from mice bearing J558-IL-27 tumors (Fig.4C) . Thus, IL-27 induced IL-10 production does not affect IL-27 induced CTL survival in vitro and in vivo.",

As shown in Fig.6A , IL-27 significantly up-regulated the expression of SOCS3, Bcl-6, Sca-1, and Bcl-2 genes in both WT P1CTL and IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells. However, more significant induction of these genes was observed in WT P1CTL cells, expressions of Bcl-xl and T-bet genes were up-regulated by IL-27 to a lesser extent in both WT P1CTL and IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells, Blimp-1 and Perforin genes were up-regulated slightly by IL-27 in WT but not IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells. In contrast, expressions of Eomes and granzyme B genes were down-regulated in both WT P1CTL and IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells. IL-27 has been shown to activate STAT3 [3, 16] , and STAT3 activation is known to induce expression of SOCS3 [25] and the Bcl family of proteins [25] [26] [27] . Western blot (Fig.  6B ) and flow cytometry (Fig.6C ) analyses verified that IL-27 activated STAT3 and upregulated Bcl2, Bcl-6, SOCS3, Sca-1, and perforin while reduced the expression of Eomes and granzyme B in activated WT P1CTL cells; in IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells, IL-27 upregulated p-Stat3, Bcl-6, Sca-1 and down-regulated Eomes. However, IL-27 did not alter the expression of Bcl-2, SOCS3, Bcl-xl, granzyme B and Perforin at the protein level in IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells. IL-27 stimulation also reduced the expression of cleaved caspase 3, a key executer of apoptosis [28] , in activated WT and IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells (Fig.6B) . Thus, IL-27 induces a memory precursor cell (MPC) phenotype [25] in tumor antigen specific CD8 + T cells characterized by strong expression of Bcl-6, SOCS3 and Sca-1. However, in the absence of IL-10, the induction of MPC phenotype and survival molecules by IL-27 is diminished.",

To test if IL-27activated P1CTL cells give rise to memory T cells, we developed an adoptive transfer animal model. Ten million P1A35-43 peptide and IL-27 activated P1CTL or IL-10 -/-P1CTL (H-2 d ) cells were adoptively transferred into each NK-depleted Rag1 -/-ebi3 -/-C57BL6 mouse (H-2 b ) [31] . Due to MHC mismatch, only memory T cells can survive in the mice. In this model, IL-27 is absent, thus the adoptively transferred T cells are not exposed to endogenous IL-27, and the memory T-cell pool reflects the original qualities of MPCs. As demonstrated in Fig.7A , similar numbers of CD8 + V\u03b18.3 + cells were detected in the blood of the two groups of recipient mice by day 1 after T-cell transfer; by day 7 after T cell transfer, mice receiving 1 \u00d7 10 7 activated P1CTL cells experienced a significant expansion and had significantly higher numbers of CD8 + V\u03b18.3 + T cells than mice receiving 1 \u00d7 10 7 IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells. By day 32 after T-cell transfer, a reduced, but distinctive, population of CD8 + V\u03b18.3 + T cells could still be detected in both groups. However, mice receiving P1CTL cells had significantly higher numbers of CD8 + V\u03b18.3 + T cells than mice receiving IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells (Fig.7A ). Upon challenge with J558 tumor cells, P1CTL recipient mice showed significantly diminished tumor growth compared to IL-10 -/-P1CTL recipient mice (Fig.7B ). The tumors from IL-10 -/-P1CTL recipients also had much less infiltration of CD8 + V\u03b18.3 + T cells compared to tumors from WT P1CTL recipients (Fig.7C) . Thus, mice receiving IL-27 activated P1CTL cells had a stronger memory T-cell response compared with mice receiving IL-27 activated IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells.",

We have made the following three major observations that could explain why IL-27 enhances anti-tumor CTL responses and tumor rejection. First, IL-27-stimulated CTLs have survival advantage. Second, IL-27 induces IL-10 production by tumor antigen specific CTL cells, which contributes to CTL-mediated tumor rejection. Third, IL-27 induces a unique MPC/effector cell phenotype in activated CD8 + T cells, characterized by up-regulation of SOCS3, Bcl-6, Sca-1, and IL-10, and gives rise to memory T cells.

The pro-survival effect was observed in both IL-27-stimulated WT and IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells, suggesting that the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-27 is independent of IL-27-induced IL-10 production. IL-27 and IL-10 both activate Stat3 [3, 16, 25] , and activation of Stat3 is known to up-regulate Bcl family of molecules [25] [26] [27] . Indeed, in this study we found that IL-27-stimulated CTLs down-regulated production of cleaved caspase-3 and up-regulated a number of bcl family genes, including bcl-2, bcl-6 and bcl-xl. Thus, the IL-27-mediated pro-survival effect is associated with activation of Stat3-Bcl antiapoptosis pathways. Although IL-27 promotes survival of IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells, western blot analysis revealed a notable reduction of IL-27-induced Bcl2 protein compared with IL-27stimulated WT P1CTL cells. This result suggests that IL-10-deficiency may affect CTL survival in more physiological conditions where high levels of IL-27 are not available. This point is supported by our finding that the long term survival of IL-27-stimulated IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells was impaired in vivo (Fig.7) . The strong anti-apoptosis effect of IL-27 could explain why, in tumor models, more CTLs accumulate in the IL-27-positive tumor microenvironment.",

            "text": "In this study, we also demonstrate that IL-27-induced IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells contributes to their anti-tumor efficacy. This conclusion is supported by three lines of evidence. First, adoptive transfer of IL-27-stimulated P1CTL cells, which produce high amounts of IL-10, had better therapeutic efficacy than IL-27-stimulated IL-10-deficient P1CTL. Second, adoptive transfer of P1CTL or IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells into Rag2 -/or Rag2 -/-IL-10 -/mice with established J558-IL-27 tumors shows that P1CTL cells can reject tumors better than IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells. Third, J558-IL-27 tumor cells, which failed to grow into tumors in BALB/c mice due to a potent anti-tumor CTL response, could grow into tumors in IL-10 -/-BALB/c mice. IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells are usually considered as suppressor cells that down-regulate T-cell responses [33] . However, recent studies showed that IL-10 producing CTLs were more highly activated and cytolytic than IL-10-deficient CTLs [17, 34] . In this study, we found that IL-27-stimulated IL-10-deficient CTLs expressed similar levels of IFN-\u03b3, granzyme B and perforin, and exhibited similar levels of cytotoxicity to target cells compared to their WT counterparts. However, IL-10-deficiency significantly reduced the expression of IL-27-induced survival molecules, such as SOCS3, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6 in CTLs. Thus, IL-27 induced CTL IL-10 production increases their survival potential, which can lead to stronger CTL responses. Our finding that IL-27 induced CTL IL-10 production contributes to their efficacy in tumor rejection suggests that IL-10 producing CTLs are better effectors rather than suppressor cells.",

IL-27 significantly up-regulates STAT3 responsive molecules SOCS3, Bcl-6, Sca-1, and IL-10 in P1CTL. SOCS3 and Bcl-6 have recently been shown to be critical in establishing CD8 + T cell memory [25] . Sca-1 is a cell membrane molecule usually expressed on self-renewing stem cells and is a marker of central memory CD8 + T cells [35] [36] . IL-10 has also been shown to play a vital role in CD8 + T-cell memory [37] , presumably via induction of SOCS3 [25] . In this study we find that in the absence of IL-10, the capacity for IL-27 induction of MPC phenotype in CD8 + T cells is greatly diminished, which is mainly reflected by reduced expression of SOCS3, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6. Adoptive transfer experiments suggest that IL-10-deficient CD8 + T cells do not give rise to good memory response compared to IL-27-stimulated WT P1CTL cells. Thus, IL-27 induced CTL IL-10 production contributes to MPC induction and CTL memory.",

However, we also found that IL-27 up-regulated the expression of T-bet, Blimp-1, and Perforin, down-regulated the expression of Eomes, IFN-\u03b3, and slightly down-regulated granzyme B. Up-regulation of T-bet and downregulation of Eomes have been demonstrated in IL-12-stimulated CD8 + T cells previously [38] , and are associated with CD8 + T-cell differentiation into effector but not memory T cells [25, 38] . The controversy of up-regulation of T-bet with down-regulation of IFN-\u03b3 in P1CTL can be explained by IL-27 induction of Bcl-6, which has been shown to inhibit Tbet-induced IFN-\u03b3 production [39] . Collectively, these results suggest that IL-27 programs tumor antigen specific CD8 + T cells into MPC-like effector cells. This phenotype can potentially increase CTL \"stemness\", without affecting their effector functions such as cytotoxicity. Interestingly, recent studies in humans [40] and mice [41] demonstrate that other effector T cells, such as Th17 cells, also have stem cell characteristics with prolonged survival, suggesting that effector cell \"stemness\" may be a universal mechanism for maintaining long term survival of effector T cells.",

While STAT3 activation and the CTL survival-enhancing effects can be independent of CTL IL-10 production, we show that IL-27-mediated CTL IL-10 production contributes to MPC phenotype induction, CTL memory and tumor rejection. These findings have important implications for the design of human cancer immunotherapy. For instance, since IL-27 enhances CTL memory response, it could be used as an adjuvant to boost anti-cancer vaccine efficacy as demonstrated in the case of IL-12 and IL-27 combined gene therapy [10] . In addition, IL-27 could also be used for optimal ex vivo expansion of tumor infiltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes for CTL adoptive transfer therapy of human cancer.",

Live cells in cultures were counted under a microscope by Trypan blue exclusion every 24 hours for a period of 5 days. Data are shown as mean + SD of 3 samples in each group and are representative of five experiments performed with similar results. (B) As described in (A), cultured P1CTL cells were stained for Annexin V and 7-AAD on day 3-5 and analyzed by flow cytometry. Annexin V + 7-AAD + P1CTL cells were plotted using day 4 data. Data are shown as mean + SD of 4 samples in each group (right). (C) 5 \u00d7 10 6 J558-IL-27 or J558-Ctrl cells were injected into each Rag-2 -/-BALB/c mouse s.c. The tumor growth was observed over time. Data are shown as mean + SD of 5 mice in each group and are representative of three experiments performed with similar results. (D) 5 \u00d7 10 6 J558-IL-27 or J558-Ctrl cells were injected into each Rag-2 -/-BALB/c mouse s.c. When tumors grew to 5 mm in diameter, 10 \u00d7 10 6 splenocytes from P1CTL mice were injected into each mouse i.v.
