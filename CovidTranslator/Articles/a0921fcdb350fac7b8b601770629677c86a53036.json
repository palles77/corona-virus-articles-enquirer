However, since the discovery in 1969 by Mebus (Mebus et aL, 1969 ) that a virus was present in feces of calves suffering from diarrhea, it has been proved that rotaviruses can infect and cause diarrhea in calves. This discovery also prompted the search for a similar or related virus as a cause of diarrhea in other animals as well as in humans. As a result of these investigations, rotavirus has been found to be a major cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in most mammals and in fowl (Flewett and Woode, 1978; McNulty, 1978; Woode, 1982) , and it is now accepted that up to 60% of nonbacterial gastroenteritis cases may be caused by rotavirus, the remaining cases being caused by a variety of viral agents which may include Coronavirus, calicivirus, parvovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, mini-reovirus, or rotalike viruses (Table I) . However, the exact role and prevalence of some of these etiological agents in causing diarrhea have not been firmly established in all mammals.",

            "text": "The viruses which cause gastroenteric infections can generally be divided into two groups. In the first group, replication is restricted to the gastrointestinal tract and induce disease as a result of their direct effects only on the cells of the intestine. In this case most of these agents generally enter the host directly, via the oral cavity, into the gastrointestinal tract. The second group in viruses can enter the host via the oral cavity and replicate in the gastrointestinal tract, but do not remain localized. These viruses may spread to other target organs such as lymphoid tissue (Kahn, 1978) or even the central nervous system (Brown, 1973; Nathanson and Martin, 1979) . At least 11 different viruses can cause some degree of intestinal damage and diarrhea under appropriate conditions (Table I) . In most cases all these agents produce the most severe clinical signs during the first few weeks of life (Colloquium on selected diarrheal diseases of the young, 1978; Little and Shadduck, 1982; Woode and Bridger, 1975) . However, there are reports of virus shedding associated with diarrhea in older animals as well (Jones et al, 1979; McNulty et al, 1978; Von Bonsdorff et al, 1976) . In most cases the infection of older animals results in a subclinical infection, and it has been suggested that these animals can serve as carriers of the virus and be a source of infection for younger susceptible animals. The reasons for increased severity of diarrhea in younger animals and higher mortality is that the viruses generally causes greater villous atrophy in these younger animals.",

However, it was not recognized as an important pathogen in domestic animals until Mebus et al (1969) identified it as a cause of neonatal diarrhea in calves. Since then it has been demonstrated to play a major role in nonbacterial gastroenteritis in most mammalian species. In most outbreaks the disease occurs suddenly and spreads rapidly to other susceptible individuals. The reasons for this rapid spread is that the concentration of virus in feces can reach 10 11 particles per gram of feces, which is equivalent to 10 7 infectious doses of virus (Flewett and Woode, 1978; Woode et al, 1976a,b) . Experimental inoculation of bacteria-free filtrates containing rotavirus causes diarrhea in 12-24 hr in susceptible young animals. Associated with diarrhea is also anorexia and vomiting. The reasons for such rapid clinical signs is that, in the absence of passive antibody or local acquired immunity, the virus infects the enterocytes of the villi, rapidly killing them. The replication cycle of rotavirus is approximately 12 hr (Carpio et al, 1981) .",

Viral infection occurs in the enterocytes of the upper half of the villi of the small intestine, resulting in rapid cell death and sloughing of the cells as they die. With death, the villi become shortened and lose their adsorptive capacity (Woode and Crouch, 1978) . Furthermore, the cells at the tips of the villi are responsible for production of lactase, which aids in digestion of lactose. Thus the combination of reduced adsorptive capacity and reduced enzyme activity accounts for the diarrhea. Since the crypt cells are not damaged, regeneration of the enterocytes and recovery of the villi is generally rapid after the infection is overcome. Those animals that recover from the disease return to normal body weight within 10-28 days after infection.",

Transmissible gastroenteritis of swine was one of the first coronaviruses identified as a cause of diarrhea in animals (Doyle and Hutchings, 1946) . In young pigs, less than 2 weeks of age, diarrhea, rapid weight loss, and dehydration is dramatic and often results in death (Smith, 1956) . As animals get older the degree of villus shortening, virus shedding, and death is not as high, but morbidity remains high. As animals reach 6 months of age approximately 10,000 times as much virus is required to infect animals as it does to infect a 2-day-old piglet. Virus replication occurs in the epithelial cells covering primarily the villi of the jejunum and ileum, with subsequent death, denudation, and shortening of the villi. The new cells that migrate from the crypts to replace the denuded cells are not infected by the virus. The reason for this resistance is not fully known, but it can be that these immature undifferentiated cells are not able to replicate the virus (Moon et aL, 1976; Thake et aL, 1973) .",

Bovine Coronavirus, like rotavirus diarrhea, occurs in 15-24 hr after infection. Early in infection the villous epithelial cells appear morphologically normal but contain large amounts of antigen. Since diarrhea occurs before denudation and loss of enterocytes, it is postulated that the initial diarrhea occurs as a result of infection of the cell and redirection of cellular functions from adsorption to virus replication. If adsorption does not occur, there is accumulation of digestive fluids. As the infection proceeds cells are lost from the villi and are replaced by immature squamous to cuboidal epithelial cells which lack the enzymes required for digestion of milk and also have reduced adsorptive capacity, as is the case in all other virus infection of the gastrointestinal tract.",

However, there are still 20-30% of diarrhea cases for which no etiological agent has been observed. As the search continues for etiological agents, it will not be surprising if other viruses are discovered. One such new agent the \"Bredavirus\" has been identified. In the case of Bredavirus infection, the lesions may at first appear similar to those of Coronavirus infections with respect to location. However, on closer examination it becomes obvious that the disease is different, since the lesions and virusinfected cells are visible in the lower 50% of the villi and in the crypts of the small intestine.

Furthermore, it is not always possible to reproduce the disease in conventional animals. No good explanation exists as to why this occurs, but it is possible that too few cells are infected to disrupt absorption. This may be due to the presence of avir-ulent strains or of strains that are extremely localized (Woode, 1982 ). Another explanation could be related to immunity. If low levels of active or passive immunity are present, this would keep the virus infection rate low so as to allow only few viruses to initiate new infections, as is often the case with many persistent local infections. However, during stress the immune system may be reduced and virus shedding and diarrhea may occur. When the immune system returns to normal, diarrhea stops but virus may continue to be shed. This type of carrier state would ensure the continued presence of the virus in the environment and be present to reinfect susceptible neonatal animals. Such carrier states have been demonstrated to occur both in vivo (Benfield et aL, 1982; Leece and King, 1980) and in vitro (Misra and Babiuk, 1980) .",

With this large amount of virus present it is very easy to observe virus in feces by electron microscopy techniques. However, direct observation is less efficient than if combined with serological tests, as is the case with immune electron microscopy (IEM), where the virus is aggregated by specific sera and can be visualized much more easily. The availability of specific antisera and monoclonal antibodies to numerous viruses makes this a very attractive means of diagnosis. Although many enteric viruses do not grow in culture, some may infect cells without causing a cytopathic effect or producing infectious virus. In these cases the viruses may be identified by culturing in vitro and testing for the presence of viral antigens within virus-infected cells.",

            "text": "curs. In rota-and coronaviruses, which infect the cells at the tips of the villi, as infection progresses the adsorptive cells are replaced with immature squamous to cuboidal epithelial cells. Until these cells mature their adsorptive capacity and enzymatic activity is greatly reduced. Since these immature cells also appear to be relatively resistant to virus infection, the disease is often self-limiting if dehydration is not so significant as to cause death (Woode, 1982; Garwes, 1982; Moon et aL, 1976) . Since the crypt cells are not damaged, the rate of recovery is generally rapid. In contrast, in the case of viruses that infect the crypt cells and also lead to shortening of villi, there are a limited number of new cells available to migrate up the villi, and recovery tends to take longer. It should be stressed that although the degree of villous damage may be influenced by the virulence of the virus and the immunological status of the animal, the rate of regeneration of enterocytes and of enterocyte maturation may also vary with the age, the species, and the site of virus infection. Since glucose and sodium adsorption are highest in the proximal and middle part of the jejunum (Bachmann and Hess, 1982; Shephard et aL, 1979) , damage here would cause most severe diarrhea. In viral infections, the mechanism of fluid loss is considered to be different from that in bacterial infections; however, the net losses may be the same. In viral infections fluid loss is predominantly from the extracellular fluid due to impaired adsorption, and osmotic loss is due primarily to the presence of undigested lactose in the lumen rather than active secretion (Graham et aL, 1982; Lewis and Philips, 1972; Lewis, 1973, Tennant et aL, 1978) . However, replacement of mature adsorptive cells with immature cells, which retain some of their secretory functions, also increases the rate of secretion (Butler et aL, 1974; Kerzner et aL, 1977; Pansaert et aL, 1970) . As the virus kills the adsorptive cells there is also a loss of enzymes responsible for digestion of disaccharides. Furthermore, loss of differentiated villi cells diminishes glucose, sodium carrier, and Na + , K + -ATPase activities which aid in loss of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonates, and water. The loss of bicarbonate leads to the development of acidosis. However, acidosis also develops as a result of increased microbial activity in response to fermentation of undigested milk (Lewis and Philips, 1978) , as well as the increased lactic acid production and decreased utili-zation in dehydrated animals (Lewis et al., 1975; Tennant et al., 1972) . Acidosis can create aK + -H + ion exchange across the cellular membrane and inhibit cellular functions required for maintaining normal potassium concentration with a net loss of potassium from cells. The next step that occurs is hypoglycemia due to decreased intestinal adsorption, minimal glycogen reserves in young animals, inhibited glyconogenesis, and increased glycolysis (Lewis and Phillips, 1978) . This series of complex pathophysiological changes if not promptly corrected results in death of the animal.",

            "text": "Severity of diarrhea is related not only to the virulence and age of the animal, but also to the presence of multiple infections. It has been shown in a number of studies that only a minority of cases of diarrhea in animals are caused by a single virus pathogen (House, 1978) . Furthermore, it has been suggested that even if a single pathogen is involved in an infection there may be heterogeneity within the pathogen (Sabara et al., 1982; Spencer et al., 1983) . Therefore, if two viruses can coinfect an animal and have different sites of replication, their combined effect may be much more severe than if they infected the animal individually. This may help explain why it is difficult to reproduce enteric infections in conventional calves with single plaque-purified virus isolates. Another important factor is the presence of viral-bacterial synergistic interactions. There is accumulating evidence that many bacterial infections can be more severe if combined with a virus infection (Gouet et al., 1978; Leece et al., 1982; Runnels et al., 1980) . Thus E. coli generally produces scours only during the first few days of life. However, if an animal is infected with a virus, E. coli can colonize and produce a more severe disease at a later age. This combination of E. coli with rota-or coronaviruses ensures that the severity of the disease is increased (Fig. 2) . The exact mechanisms by which this occurs is unknown; however, it is possible that viruses may alter fluid transport by virtue of infecting some cells. This alteration allows the buildup of toxin by bacteria that are normally nonpathogenic. Thus the combination of toxin buildup and decreased mobility of the intestine results in diarrhea. In addition, re- duced adsorption of nutrients occurs as a result of virus infection. This provides a more suitable nutritional environment for bacteria to grow, adhere, and secrete more toxin.",

Thus even if the adult animals are immune and if they transfer antibody to the young, the antibody must be present continuously in the lumen of the intestine to prevent infection, since serum antibodies are not protective (Snodgrass and Wells, 1976; Woode and Bridger, 1975) . Since many mammalian species do not continue to secrete high levels of antibody in their milk after parturition, the antibody in the intestinal lumen drops rapidly and the animal becomes fully susceptible even if it has acquired high levels of serum antibody. Thus in cattle, antibody levels in colostrum are generally high to most enteric viruses since the infection rate in adults is high. The young calf suckling a cow with high levels of antibody is protected only during the period when there are high levels of antibody in milk (Fig. 3) . However, within 5-7 days after parturition antibody levels drop below the threshold required to neutralize virus in the lumen. This is the reason why most enteric virus infections causing neonatal diarrhea in mammals do so after 1 week of age.",

Thus the supposed early nonspecific protection, possibly by interferon, and the later specific immunological protection do not occur unless the animals are immunized prior to ingestion of colostrum. This is often not possible, and therefore this vaccine has not proved to be as successful as hoped.

Since it is assumed that infections occur either as a result of virus shedding from small numbers of adults or from virus in the environment, animals should not be crowded into contaminated areas. Movement of young into clean environments, away from other animals, will greatly reduce the rate of infection and economic loss.",

Based on these findings it has been estimated that losses in the United States average $100 million annually (House, 1978) . No reports are available for losses occurring in developing countries, but it is believed that similar losses would occur worldwide on an animal-to-animal basis.",

Most virus infections are initiated in the proximal part of the small intestine and progress sometimes to the colon. Infections result in loss of adsorptive cells, villous atrophy, fluid loss, and ion imbalance. These pathophysiological events lead to anorexia, dehydration, and death. Since young animals do not have large reserves of fluids and glycogen, mortality can reach 50-80% in severe outbreaks. However, removal of milk and administration of oral electrolytes can significantly reduce losses.",

Oral immunization with live attenuated vaccines is difficult due to the high levels of maternal antibody in the milk during the first few days of life. To overcome this problem the trend is to immunize the dam so as to increase the level of antibody in milk above the threshold level required to prevent infection with field strains of virus. As more serotypes and agents involved in gastroenteritis are identified, it is becoming obvious that vaccines will have to combine various pathogens and serotypes for achievement of adequate protection. Although at least some of these vaccines may be produced by conventional methods, recombinant DNA technology may aid in providing sufficient quantities of antigens to vaccinate against viruses which do not replicate well in culture.",
