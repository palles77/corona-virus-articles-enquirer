            "text": "Disasters often set the stage for scientific inquiry that could help mitigate potential shortand long-term health effects among responders, as well as improve capabilities for responding to future events. However, the disaster environment presents many challenges for the conduct of research, including the immediate emphasis on critical response activities, limited access to incident leadership, inability to engage response personnel in scientific research activities not immediately pertinent to the event response, marshalling of necessary resources in an expeditious manner, and timely situational awareness of important occupational safety and health events during the response or recovery operation. The disaster environment is typically dynamic and often hazardous, chaotic, and highly charged with conflicting scientific opinions, political pressures, and disparities in knowledge or the capability to safely perform the required work. 1 Emergency response workers and others involved in response, remediation, and recovery efforts (referred to herein as \"responders\") are often engaged in non-routine activities in uncharacterized, potentially hazardous environments and may encounter novel or unique exposures or experience unexpected health effects. As such, there is frequently a pressing public health need to conduct research to answer critical questions regarding the health impact of these exposures and/or determine the factors that are responsible for any adverse health effects experienced in both the short-and long-term. Issues related to conducting research during and following disasters have gained increasing attention following the World Trade Center disaster in 2001 and, more recently, the Deepwater Horizon disaster. 2, 3 For example, the National Biodefense Safety Board, an advisory committee to the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), recently engaged on the topic of inclusion of scientific investigations as a component of disaster planning. 4 A responder research study, however, can be costly and difficult to design; therefore, one must carefully consider whether a proposed or requested study will be able to produce useful, reliable results and is a prudent public health investment.",

Public health activities to prevent or control disease or injury and improve health, or to improve a public health program, are not generally considered research, as the purpose of research is to generate or contribute to generalizable knowledge through a systematic and scientifically defensible process. 5",

            "text": "Baseline Activities include health monitoring, health surveillance, documentation of exposures early in and throughout disaster events, and roster/registry activities. Health monitoring refers to ongoing and systematic clinical evaluation of individual responders' health status, while health surveillance is the term used for an ongoing and systematic population-based data collection approach. Baseline activities may include routine exposure assessment, which refers to systematic industrial hygiene or environmental measurements to evaluate workers' exposures to chemical, biological, or physical hazards. Baseline activities also include compiling a \"roster,\" which is a list with contact information for all responders scheduled to perform a duty. Alternatively, a \"registry\" may be implemented to collect, store, and manage information about affected populations at risk of exposure or who have developed a specific disease. The absence of rosters or registries, or sufficient, wellorganized exposure data, makes subsequent responder health research studies difficult to conduct, and quite probably less accurate because identifying the universe of response and remediation workers and reconstructing potential exposures after a response has concluded can be very difficult if not impossible. While not usually considered research, per se, baseline activities nonetheless provide critical information that is fundamental to supporting any future investigation or study and should be standard practice in any emergency that entails workers entering uncharacterized or uncontrolled environments, regardless of whether a decision to conduct a responder health research study has been made. Additionally, baseline activities often inform the need for responder research, assist in hypothesis generation, and/or help determine the feasibility of the proposed research.",

            "text": "Public Health Investigations are designed to provide actionable information that will have a direct impact on the health and safety of current responders. Public health investigations involve medical/epidemiologic investigations, industrial hygiene assessments, and/or biological monitoring to assess individual exposure levels and health effects. The focus and timing of these investigations are often to resolve questions arising during the course of the response to help mitigate exposure or disease and identify early indications of significant adverse health effects among responders. Because of the time elements inherent in these studies, they primarily address acute effects, conditions, or concerns and are not designed to detect delayed or chronic effects. Typically, these investigations are not considered research because they are not designed to produce generalizable knowledge, although information derived from the investigations can sometimes inform future responses. As with baseline studies, public health investigations may serve to generate or explore hypotheses and stimulate research ideas. Examples of public health investigations include cross-sectional surveys (\"snapshot\" surveys of workers that collect information about health issues, risk factors, and exposures at the same point in time), cluster investigations (evaluations of reported conditions and illness above the expected level), exposure assessment investigations, case series (tracking individuals by examining similar exposures and health outcomes), and site-specific investigations, such as NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluations. 6 Pilot Studies are typically small-scale studies designed to collect information on the feasibility and value of conducting a more comprehensive responder health research study. A pilot investigation also may test, inform or improve the design of an eventual larger research project. Such studies can provide valuable insights; for example, should any research component be identified as missing in the pilot study, it can be added to the larger research study to improve the chances of a clear outcome. Additionally, if insufficient rationale is present to justify a larger research study, pilot research studies can sometimes provide this justification. Pilot studies can be particularly useful in identifying design issues (e.g., a planned procedure or assessment is impractical in the field) before more comprehensive research is conducted. Furthermore, pilot studies may also be considered when data are needed expeditiously because it may not be available later once a larger research study is designed and approved.",

In response to this need, the Director of NIOSH convened a work group consisting of senior NIOSH scientists experienced with disaster response and representing the disciplines of epidemiology, occupational medicine and psychiatry, and industrial hygiene, and that included former directors of the NIOSH emergency preparedness and response program, medical staff involved in the World Trade Center Health Program, and epidemiologists involved in industry-wide studies.

Search terms including \"emergency responder, disaster worker, emergency worker, first responder\" and \"long-term study, post-disaster study, surveillance, health monitoring\" yielded numerous studies that investigated the health status of emergency response workers in various response scenarios; however, none of these studies addressed the thought processes or criteria involved in the decision to conduct such a study, and no general treatments of this issue were identified. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), however, has developed guidance for determining if an environmental assessment should be conducted in a nonemergency situation. 7 The National Biodefense Science Board recently released a report discussing the need for disaster research and the significant barriers to conducting disaster research, but this report does not specifically address the decision process on whether to proceed with research. 4 trends in emergency response research methodologies. While considering various criteria potentially necessary for determining the need for a study, it became clear that developing a focused hypothesis (or hypotheses) based on varying pre-existing information would be a critical component of an effective decision-making process. The work group then discussed factors that should be evaluated to assess whether a study was warranted, including issues such as feasibility and research significance. Using these considerations, the group conducted a table top exercise (described later in the paper) to test the validity of this decision-making process.",

For example, when broad concerns are voiced about potential health effects in a disaster, a research organization may translate the problem into one that can be investigated with available resources. While the translation often narrows and simplifies the focus to something manageable and potentially resolvable, researchers need to be vigilant to ensure that the hypothesis is constructed so that it remains capable of evaluating the original health concerns. If the research is capable of only addressing a narrow aspect of the original health concern, or if it can only address a tangential issue, then serious consideration is necessary as to whether it is prudent to proceed with the research. Alternatively, a research organization may attempt to initiate research around an overly expansive or complex hypothesis in an attempt to satisfy the original broad health concerns.

The Work Group focused specifically on the release of radioactive contamination from the severely damaged Fukushima Daiichi facility into the surrounding environment and the ensuing potential for radiation exposures to workers during efforts to contain the damage. Health Physicist subject matter experts participated in the exercise to assist with defining the research needs associated with worker exposure to ionizing radiation. The exercise revealed that the above set of factors/questions served as a useful tool in determining priority research questions resulting from the incident, helping to elucidate various information, exposure, and resource needs, as well as public health significance. For example, it was determined that this event would provide a unique opportunity to address a number of questions of significant public health importance, including the adequacy of current exposure standards, issues regarding chronic exposure, impact of work involving long-term decontamination, utility of chromosome and biomarker data for evaluating effects on different exposure cohorts, and psychological effects on responders.
