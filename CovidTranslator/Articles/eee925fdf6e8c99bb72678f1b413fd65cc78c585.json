Methods Using hybridoma technology, we generated a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against recombinant human RANK receptor and characterized by SDS PAGE, ELISA, Western Blot and immunocytochemistry, then synthesized osteoclast-targeting bioconjugates of salmon calcitonin (sCT) using this antibody by generating thiol groups on mAb using 2-Iminothiolane and subsequently reacting them with sCT-PEG-MAL synthesised from sCT and NHS-PEG-MAL. To test the efficacy of the conjugate in vitro, osteoclasts were generated from precursor RAW 264.7 cells by dosing with the cytokines macrophagecolony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and RANK Ligand (RANKL) and TRAP activity assay, Resorption Pit Assay, TRAP staining were performed. Cytotoxicity of the mAb-sCT conjugate was also evaluated in RAW 264.7 cells; sCT bioactivity and CTR binding potential were evaluated by in vitro intracellular cAMP stimulation assay in human T47D breast cancer cells.",

Immunocytochemistry confirmed the osteoclast targeting potential of the antibody. Successful conjugation of the antibody with sCT was confirmed by SDS PAGE and ELISA. Multinucleated osteoclast formation was confirmed by staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Conjugate functionality was confirmed by TRAP activity and Resorption Pit assay, showing the inhibitory effect on osteoclast differentiation. cAMP assay confirmed the retention of calcitonin bioactivity after conjugation. Conclusions Our strategy offers the potential for a \"universal\" osteoclast-targeting platform-one that targets the RANK receptor on osteoclast cells by simply altering the conjugated cargo in order to affect the specific regulation of osteoclast cells.",

The increase in bone resorption is due both to increased osteoclastogenesis and to decreased osteoclast apoptosis (2, 3) . Osteoclasts may also play a role in the etiology of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), the most common form of arthritis. At an early stage of disease pathogenesis, there is a phase of increased bone resorption and turnover in periarticular subchondral bone volume and an increased number of osteoclasts, prior to later stage sclerosis and eburnation (4) . Similarly, increased osteoclast functional activity is directly responsible for the generalized bone loss that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis (5) . Thus, we hypothesized that an antiresorptive strategy that selectively targets osteoclasts and/or carries an active drug to osteoclast cells directly would be highly desirable as a therapeutic to treat bone disease involving upregulated osteoclast activity.",

            "text": "To determine the in vitro efficacy of the anti-RANK mAb-sCT conjugate on osteoclast activity, we quantified osteoclast activity using a spectrophotometric total culture TRAP activity assay and a mineral resorption assay. TRAP has been shown to be a specific and sensitive indicator of bone resorption (36) and contributes to the intracellular processing of primary bone matrix degradation products prior to its final release through the basolateral membrane of resorbing osteoclast cells (37, 38) . Osteoclasts, as the bone-resorbing cells of the body, further show the ability to dissolve the mineralized inorganic phase of bone matrix known as hydroxyapatite (39) . We found that the use of our conjugate in culture significantly reduced TRAP enzyme activity as compared to sCT alone, and use of the mAb alone also showed inhibition of TRAP enzyme activity. Although the cause for this effect shown by our anti-RANK antibody alone has not been tested, we speculate that in binding the RANK receptor, the antibody may be functioning as a receptor antagonist. That competitive binding would interfere with the interaction of RANKL with RANK, an essential step of osteoclast differentiation. Nonetheless, further antiresorptive and/or anabolic effector functions could be attributed with the development of a targeted delivery strategy to osteoclast cell receptors. We further evaluated if the mAb-sCT conjugate had an effect on the ability of osteoclasts to resorb bone. We cultured osteoclast-like cells on calcium phosphate-coated culture plates in the presence of conjugate, antibody or sCT. We found that both the conjugate and the mAb alone were capable of significantly reducing the resorption of mineral layer as compared to the sCT alone. Then, we performed cyclic AMP assay to confirm that bioactivity of conjugated calcitonin. Human breast carcinoma T47D cells known to express the calcitonin receptor were used for this purpose. Binding of sCT with its receptor activates adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme responsible for the generation of cAMP. Our in vitro cAMP assay results confirmed that the modification of sCT by conjugation did not interfere with its ability to bind the calcitonin receptor and trigger its biological activity. We measured the conjugate to have increased activity over calcitonin alone, and the exact reason for that effect is still not clear. It is likely our conjugation strategy allowed one mole of antibody to become conjugated with greater than one mole of calcitonin. It has been reported that when IgG is treated with a 10 molar excess of Traut's reagent, 3-7 thiol groups are generated, which may result in the attachment of 3-7 PEGylated calcitonin molecules per molecule of IgG.",

However, neither the \"scavenging\" nor \"antagonist\" motives of those antiresorptive strategies focus on the targeted delivery of a given drug cargo (such as our anti-RANK mAb-conjugate design) which would function as a universal osteoclast targeting platform.",

            "text": "One potential limitation of our osteoclast targeting platform remains that RANKL-RANK signaling is not entirely restricted to osteoclasts and their precursors, but is known to be involved in the regulation of other cell types. Studies have that RANKL-RANK signaling controls the development of lactating mammary glands in pregnancy, with the highest levels being at day 15.5 in mice (40, 41) . Several studies that looked at transgenic Rankl-/-and Rank-/-mice found that there was a complete absence of lymph nodes (42) . This led to further studies involving patients with an osteoclast-poor form of the autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), where they found the cause of the disease to be various mutations in RANKL (43) . The same research then found that these patients showed no palpable signs of lymph nodes, further strengthening the theory that RANKL-RANK signaling is involved in lymph node formation in humans. RANK is further known to be expressed by monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells, specialized immune cells programmed to capture and process antigens in the body and present them to na\u00efve T-cells (44) . However, the targeting of drug \"cargo\" to the RANK receptors of those cells may not necessarily result in drug action with those cells if the cargo is carefully chosen not to affect those cell types. For example, it is highly unlikely for any cell (other than the mature osteoclast) to express both the RANK receptor and calcitonin receptor at the same time. Thus, the Boolean \"and/or\" logic can be applied to the selection of the differential cargo targeting to cellular phenotypes expressing the RANK receptor at any given time. The extent of this limitation remains to be fully determined, however, should not necessarily preclude the further exploration of RANK receptor targeting strategies, which may in turn provide a more comprehensive understanding of RANK signaling and crosstalk with other signaling pathways.",
