We aim to recruit at least 2500 participants \u22651 year old presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), with symptom duration \u226472 hours in primary care over three consecutive periods of confirmed high influenza incidence. Participant outcomes will be followed-up to 28 days by diary and telephone. The primary objective is to determine whether adding antiviral treatment to best usual primary care is effective in reducing time to return to usual daily activity with fever, head-and muscle-ache reduced to minor severity or less. Secondary objectives include determining cost-effectiveness, benefits in subgroups of participants according to age (<12, 12-64, >64 years), severity of symptoms (low, medium, high), comorbidity (yes/no), and duration of symptoms (\u226448hours/>48-72 hours), decrease in",

Oseltamivir might also modify the immune response to influenza infection by reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines which might, in turn, modulate symptoms of influenza 11 . Industry-sponsored trials (or studies), efficacy studies and clinical study reports of NIs, most often oseltamivir, have been the subject of many systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including individual patient meta-analyses [12] [13] [14] .

However, there has never been a large-scale, international, publically funded, pragmatic RCT of its cost-effectiveness in primary care, and so the evidence base either to support or not support the routine use of this agent in primary care is inadequate and raises the question: does the effect found in previous efficacy studies translate into a meaningful benefit in every day primary care? Specifically, what are the overall costs and benefits of this possible shortened symptom duration from the perspective of the individual sufferer, the health services, and for society? Do patients considered to be at higher risk for complications of influenza (for example due to age, duration and severity of Answering these questions will reduce important clinical uncertainty for primary care clinicians about whether to prescribe antiviral agents for ILI, and whether or not to prioritise antiviral treatment for subgroups of primary care patients.",

This is done by incorporating a Bayesian modelling approach, combined with response adaptive randomization based on pre-specified In ALIC 4 E, participants will be initially randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the two arms, with stratification by subgroup and random blocks. Each arm will maintain at least a 10% probability of randomisation within each subgroup throughout the course of the trial. Arm superiority will be assessed by subgroup and may be declared superior in some subgroups, but not within others. If, at an interim analysis, an arm meets the superiority criterion for one of the treatments, randomization probabilities may be modified for those subgroups such that a minimum of 10% of participants are allocated to the inferior arm, with the remaining allocation to the superior arm (a maximum of 90%, if two arms). In this event, stratification and blocking will no longer occur within these subgroups. This will ensure the majority of participants receive the best-known therapy, yet the trial design will still allow the assessment of seasonal variation and population changes in the study population over time.

Furthermore, the aim is to include a wide age-range of participants, as well as those with co-morbidities. Additionally, in the event of an influenza The adaptive design offers several advantages over a traditional study design. Recruitment into a particular arm can be stopped once a pre-determined level of certainty about the effectiveness or non-effectiveness of treatment in that arm has reached a pre-defined estimated precision. Adaptive randomisation will increase the chances of participants being allocated to arms where their information will be most useful and to the intervention that is most effective for them. This can lead to better patient care and better patient outcomes as the trial progresses. Secondly, the platform design allows new intervention arms to be added to the trial, benefiting from comparisons with existing treatment arms in a head to head way.",

Additionally, the design provides the ability to prospectively identify particular subgroups of interest that may receive benefit from antiviral agents, as opposed to estimating a single overall effect. This is done by incorporating a Bayesian modelling approach, combined with response adaptive randomization based on pre-specified 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 In ALIC 4 E, participants will be initially randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the two arms, with stratification by subgroup and random blocks. Each arm will maintain at least a 10% probability of randomisation within each subgroup throughout the course of the trial. Arm superiority will be assessed by subgroup and may be declared superior in some subgroups, but not within others. If, at an interim analysis, an arm meets the superiority criterion for one of the treatments, randomization probabilities may be modified for those subgroups such that a minimum of 10% of participants are allocated to the inferior arm, with the remaining allocation to the superior arm (a maximum of 90%, if two arms). In this event, stratification and blocking will no longer occur within these subgroups. This will ensure the majority of participants receive the best-known therapy, yet the trial design will still allow the assessment of seasonal variation and population changes in the study population over time.

Annual influenza epidemics account for considerable morbidity and mortality[1][2][3][4] and influenza outbreaks have the potential to become pandemics 2 . Effective control and management of seasonal and pandemic influenza is a high priority for national governments. Routine use of antiviral agents is rare in European primary care5  . General practitioners (GPs) in Europe generally advise patients who consult with influenza-like illness (ILI) to take paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), either as required or at regular intervals. They may also provide advice about other over-the-counter (OTC) medicines and self-management of ILI symptoms, e.g. maintaining fluids, bed rest and taking time off work or school. This broad approach is currently considered best usual care for the empirical management of ILI in Europe 6-8 .Currently, the most suitable antiviral agent available for pragmatic evaluation in ALIC 4 E is oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae), a neuraminidase inhibitor (NI). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved oseltamivir in 1999. Oseltamivir was classified by the WHO as an essential medicine until 2017 9,10 , and many countries have stockpiles of the drug to ensure it is readily available to treat seasonal and pandemic influenza 5 . Oseltamivir could therefore be used for the management of ILI on assumption that many cases of ILI may be caused by influenza, the probability of this being higher during confirmed periods of heightened influenza based on national reports of ILI consultations and laboratory confirmed influenza cases.Oseltamivir phosphate is an oral pro-drug which undergoes hydrolysis by hepatic esterase to form active oseltamivir carboxylate. Oseltamivir carboxylate acts by selective inhibition of influenza A and B viral neuraminidase. This enzyme normally promotes release of the virus from infected cells by cleaving terminal sialic acid residues on the surface of host cells and influenza virus envelopes, and facilitates viral movement within the respiratory tract. By blocking the activity of the enzyme, oseltamivir prevents new viral particles from being released11,12  . Oseltamivir might also modify the immune response to influenza infection by reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines which might, in turn, modulate symptoms of influenza13  .",

In two recent meta-analyses that differed in their methods and the primary outcome measures used, but that included almost the same set of trials, Jefferson et al. found that oseltamivir improved the mean time to first alleviation of symptoms over the placebo by 16.8 hours13  and Dobson et al. found oseltamivir improved the median time to alleviation of all symptoms over the placebo by 17.8 hours 15 . The reviewers also found that oseltamivir reduced the risk of self-reported, non-verified pneumonia but not for clinically diagnosed pneumonia 13,15 . Dobson et al. furthermore indicated that treatment with oseltamivir might reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract infection complications and hospitalization in patients testing positive for influenza15  . However, increased nausea and vomiting were found to be associated with oseltamivir use13,15  . Even with a possible reduction in symptom duration (compared to a placebo) the value of oseltamivir treatment of previously healthy individuals with non-severe seasonal influenza is questionable.Conversely, circumstances of some individuals, for example those urgently needing to return to work and parents and other carers, may mean that a reduction in function-limiting symptoms of a day may be considered very worthwhile. The UK Academy of Medical Sciences recently reviewed current evidence, and they advised that additional pragmatic trials in primary care and cost-effectiveness analyses that take virulence and severity of the circulating strain into account are required to further inform such judgements 17 .Since 1999, oseltamivir has generated sales in excess of $18bn (\u00a311bn; \u20ac13bn). The UnitedStates stockpiled 65 million treatments at a cost of $1.3bn. The United Kingdom spent \u00a3424m on a stockpile of 40 million doses. By 2009, 96 countries possessed enough oseltamivir for 350 million people18  . In 2017 the WHO downgraded oseltamivir in the list of essential medicines from a \"core\" drug to one that is \"complimentary\"-a category of drugs considered less cost-effective 9,10 . However, there has never been a large-scale, international, publicly funded, pragmatic RCT of its cost-effectiveness in primary care, and so the evidence base either to support or not support the routine use of this agent in primary care is inadequate and raises the question: does the effect found in previous efficacy studies translate into a meaningful benefit in every day primary care? Specifically, what are the overall costs and benefits of this possible shortened symptom duration from the perspective of the individual sufferer, the health services, and for society? Do patients considered to be at higher risk for complications of influenza (for example due to age, duration and severity of or relevant co-morbidity) benefit more from antiviral treatment in primary care?",

Emergency randomisation procedures will be available should this web-based facility be temporarily unavailable. Randomisation will initially be a 1:1 ratio between the two arms, with stratification by subgroup according to ECDC definitions of those at higher risk of complications from influenza, namely their age (<12, 12-64, >64 years), severity of symptoms (low, medium, high), any relevant comorbidity i (yes/no), and duration of symptoms since onset (\u226448hours/>48-72hours). The proportions randomised to study arms may be altered during the course of the trial following a pre-specified Bayesian, response adaptive approach26  .ALIC 4 E is an open trial. The participant, the recruiting clinician and the study personnel will be aware of the participant's allocation. An open pragmatic trial was chosen because this design is better for determining effects in routine care when patients are much less tightly supervised. Estimates of effect from placebo-controlled efficacy trials may not translate into similar effect sizes when interventions are taken up into routine clinical care. Knowledge of what medication one is taking influences help-seeking behaviour, and decisions to re-consult may substantially affect cost-effectiveness.
