Following the earlier proposition of Bylund (1988 Bylund ( , 1992 for the nomenclature of aE-adrenoceptors, these rat receptor were classified as being a2A, a2B and a2c-adrenoceptors. The aEA-adrenoceptors were found in the kidney, spinal cord and cerebral cortex, the a2B-adrenoceptors in the kidney and neonatal lung and the a2c-adrenoceptors in the spinal cord and cerebral cortex. However, we also found strong evidence that the rat a2a-adrenoceptors were heterogenous and that they could seemingly be subdivided into two forms which we termed a2B~ and a2B2 Xia et al. 1993 ). Among several subtype-selective compounds, guanoxabenz was shown to be the best drug to differentiate between the aEm-and aEBE-adrenoceptors.",

Moreover, when the recently cloned rat a2A-adrenoceptor gene R G 2 0 (Lanier et al. 1991 ) was used to express a2-adrenoceptors in COS-7 cells, the receptors obtained showed the properties of the a2A2-form of the a2Aadrenoceptor.

The resulting curves ( Table 1 , which shows the pKi-values obtained for the drugs as well as the Hill coefficients (~H) of the competition curves. All drugs, except guanoxabenz, yielded competition curves which were steep and monophasic and which showed Hill coefficients close to unity. The computer modelling for all these 39 compounds showed that the data fitted a one-site model best. Fitting the data to a two-site model resulted in only marginal and statistically insignificant (P>0.05) reductions in the sums of squares when compared with the sums of squares for a one-site model. Notably, strong agonists such as (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline also gave steep curves which were resolved only into one-site fits. This indicates that the assays, which included EDTA, Gpp(NH)p and Na +, had completely eliminated the agonist high affinity az-adrenoceptor form. The pKi-values obtained for the a2h-adrenoceptor selective drugs oxymetazoline, BRL 44408 and guanfacine, the a2B-adrenoceptor selective drugs prazosin and ARC 239, as well as the azcadrenoceptor selective compounds MK912, WB4101 and rauwolscine (see Uhl6n and Wikberg 1991 c; Uhl6n et al. 1992) were fully compatable with the notion that the sites labelled by [3H]-RX 821002 in the rat spleen were aZAadrenoceptors. However, the competition curves for guanoxabenz were strongly biphasic ( Fig. 2A ) and computer modelled best into two-site fits, the analysis showing that two site fits resulted in drastic and highly significant (P<0.0001) reductions in the sums of squares as compared to the values obtained for one site fits for all tests, whereas three sites fits did not improve the regressions. The analysis thus indicated that guanoxabenz was bound to a high affinity site (Kd = 35.5 nmol/1) and also to a low affinity site (Kd = 8910 nmol/l), a difference in affinities amounting to about 250-fold. The analysis further showed that the proportion of high affinity sites for guanoxabenz was 57.2070 +2.4070 and that of the low affinity sites was 42.8070+2.4070 (n =26). The reason that guanoxabenz was tested 26 times was that a competition curve for guanoxabenz was included daily in all assays when the other 39 compounds were tested. This was done in order to ascertain that the two forms of a2Aadrenoceptors were not missing from some of the batches of membranes used and that day to day variations did not result in an inability to observe putative differences in af-",

As summarized in Table 1 , a number of structural analogs of guanoxabenz were included among the 40 compounds tested on the spleen.

            "text": "Our previous study showed that ARC 239 had a high affinity for the kidney a2B 1-and a2R2-adrenoceptors but a low affinity for the azA-adrenoceptor. Theoretical calculations, using the Kd-Values for [3H]-RX 821002 and ARC 239 given in our previous paper (Uhl6n and Wikberg 1991 a) indicated that if 1 gmol/1 of ARC 239 was included in the assay, the binding of 2 nmol/1 [3H]-RX821002 to the a2B 1-and a2B2-receptors would be blocked by 99O7o and 95O70, respectively, whereas only 8\u00b07o of the binding to the a2A-receptors would be blocked. To evaluate this approach, we obtained competition curves for prazosin, guanoxabenz and oxymetazoline, which are subtype-selective drugs for the three kidney a2-adrenoceptors (Uhl6n and Wikberg 1991a), using 2nmol/1 [3H]-RX 821002 as well as 1 gmol/1 ARC 239 in the assays. In addition, a full competition curve for ARC 239 was obtained using the same conditions (Fig. 2 B) . When the data were analyzed by computer modelling, it was found that the drugs tested gave significant two site fits (P<0.001). These results indicated that, despite the masking effect of 1 ~mol/1 ARC239, some of the a2B2-adrenoceptors interfered in the assay. The interference from these receptors can be clearly seen as the minor tail on the competition curves of oxymetazoline and guanoxabenz as well as the minor distortion of the low concentration range of the prazosin and ARC 239 competition curve in Fig. 2B . The calculations showed that the sites labelled by [3H]-RX 821002 corresponded to -91% of a2A-sites and -9% of a2B2-sites , which was in full accord with the theoretical calculations. When the pKi-values of drugs were calculated using this form of the assay, the data were, therefore, computer modelled into two site fits to ensure that the azn2-adrenoceptor did not interfere in the determination of the drug PKi-values for the kidney azA-adrenoceptor (see legend to Table 2 for details of these calculations). Using this approach, we determined the binding constants for some compounds in addition to prazosin, guanoxabenz, oxymetazoline and ARC 239. The data from all these calculations are given in Table 2 along with the drug pKi-values determined for the rat kidney a2A-adrenoceptor in our previous study using the more elaborate 6-curve assay (Uhl6n and Wikberg 1991a) . The PKi-values for guanoxabenz, oxymetazoline, prazosin and ARC 239 obtained using the new approach are practically the same as the pKi-values obtained in our previous study, indicating the validity of the new method. As can be seen from Table 2 , the drug pKi-values obtained for the kidney a2A-adrenoceptors are virtually the same as those obtained with the rat spleen indicating that the receptors in both tissues belong to the a2A-adrenoceptor category. However, in contrast with the results obtained with the spleen, the analysis of the data for guanoxabenz binding to kidney membranes indicated that guanoxabenz bound to a single aZAadrenoceptor site; the pKi-value being practically the same as that obtained for the high affinity site in the spleen (Table 1 , 2; c.f. Fig. 2A, B) . The other N-hydroxyguanidine analogs bound with practically the same affinities to the kidney and spleen azA-adrenoceptors, which further demonstrates that guanoxabenz is unique, among the substances tested, in its ability to differentiate two forms of the azA-adrenoceptor in the rat. Table 2 . As can be seen from the table, all drugs except guanoxabenz gave pKi-values which are similar to those obtained with the spleen and with the kidney supporting the notion that all the receptors studied were of the azA-type. However, the affinity of guanoxabenz for the spinal cord azA-adrenoceptors was 100-fold lower than that obtained for the receptors in the kidney. Moreover, the affinity in the cord was also about 100-fold lower than the affinity obtained for the high affinity azA-adrenoceptor site in the spleen. On the other hand, the PKi-value for guanoxabenz interacting with the spinal cord aza-adrenoceptor was close to that obtained for the low affinity site in the spleen. These differences in drug affinities are shown in Fig. 2 . Competition curves for oxymetazoline, guanoxabenz, prazosin and ARC 239 obtained with the spinal cord are shown in Fig. 2C . Competition curves for the same compounds obtained with kidney are shown in Fig. 2B . It can be seen that, with the spinal cord, the competition curve for guanoxabenz is located far to the right of the other curves, indicating that guanoxabenz has the lowest affinity of the four drugs tested for the spinal cord a2Aadrenoceptor. With the kidney, however, the competition curve for guanoxabenz is located far to the left of the prazosin and ARC 239 competition curves and is aligned just to the right of the oxymetazoline curve, which indicates that guanoxabenz is almost as potent as oxymetazoline in binding to the kidney azA-adrenoceptors. As can also be seen from Fig. 2A , the low affinity component of the guanoxabenz curve for the spleen in located to the right of the ARC 239 curve. A similar result for the guanoxabenz curve was obtained with the spinal cord (Fig. 2C) . The high affinity component of the guanoxabenz curve for the spleen, on the other hand, is located just to the right of the oxymetazoline curve. This location of the guanoxabenz curve is the same as is found with the kidney (c. f., Fig. 2A and B) .",

            "text": "In the present study we have shown that the rat kidney a2A-adrenoceptors show grossly different binding prop-erties for guanoxabenz when compared with the a2Aadrenoceptors in the spinal cord and cerebral cortex. Thus, guanoxabenz has a Kd-value of --40 nmol/1 for the kidney a2A-adrenoceptor whereas it has Kd-values of about 4,000 nmol/1 for the spinal cord and cerebral cortex a2A-adrenoceptors, respectively. Moreover, the data of the present study show that guanoxabenz apparently binds with two affinities to a2A-adrenoceptors in the rat spleen. The K d of guanoxabenz for the high affinity form of the spleen a2A-adrenoceptor was 35 nmol/1 whereas the K d for the low affinity form was 8,900 nmol/1. These values amount to an approximately 100-to 250-fold difference in apparent affinity for the two forms of the a2A-adrenoceptor. Thus, it appears that one of the two forms of the spleen a2A-adrenoceptor shows a high affinity for guanoxabenz similar to that shown by the a2A-adrenoceptor in the kidney whereas the other shows a low affinity for guanoxabenz similar to that shown by the a2A-adrenoceptors in the spinal cord and cerebral cortex. In the present study we have also shown that the rat a2A-adrenoceptor clone RG20, when expressed in COS-7 cells, produces an a2A-adrenoceptor whose guanoxabenz affinity corresponds exactly to that found for the form of the a2A-adrenoceptor showing the lower affinity for guanoxabenz in the different tissues investigated. The affinities for a number of other drugs are completely consistent with the view that all of the a2-adrenoceptors studied were of the a2A-type. Thus, the affinities for a2A-adrenoceptor selective drugs such as guanfacine, BRL44408 and oxymetazoline, for a2Badrenoceptor selective drugs such as ARC239 and prazosin as well as for a2c-adrenoceptor-selective drugs such as MK 912, WB 4101 and rauwolscine corresponded exactly to those for a2A-adrenoceptors (see Uhl6n and Wikberg 1991 a, c; Uhl6n et al. 1992) . By contrast, these affinities are distinctly different from the affinities that we have previously determined for a2B-and a2cadrenoceptors (Uhl6n and Wikberg 1991 a, c; Uhl~n et al. 1992; Xia et al. 1993) . Therefore, all the az-adrenoceptors investigated in the present study are clearly of the a2A-adrenoceptor type. However, the data of our present study indicate that these a2A-adrenoceptors exist in two forms with highly differing apparent affinities for guanoxabenz. We suggest that these forms of a2Aadrenoceptors should be operationally termed a2A 1 and a2A2, the a2A~ form showing high affinity, and the a2A2 form showing low affinity, for guanoxabenz. This nomenclature is in line with our previous nomenclature for two apparent forms of a2B-adrenoceptors in the rat which were termed a2B1 and a2B2 . Guanoxabenz, which is an N-hydroxyguanidine, seems to have quite remarkable properties that enable it to differentiate between the a2A1-and a2A2-forms of the a2A-adrenoceptors (present study) as well as between the a2B 1-and a2B2-forms of the a2B-adrenoceptors Xia et al. 1993 ). In the present study we evaluated several other N-hydroxyguanidines which are structural analogs to guanoxabenz. Interestingly none of these were capable of delineating the rat q2A1-and aZA2-adrenoceptor subtypes. These results indicate that the structural requirements for selectivity at a2A 1-and a2A2-adrenoceptors are strict and not solely dependent on the hydroxyguanidinium side chain present in guanoxabenz. In this context, we would like to mention that we have recently found that LTI1, which is also an Nhydroxyguanidine, was useful in discriminating between a2B 1-and azB2-adrenoceptors in the rat kidney (Xia et al. 1993 ). In the present study, however, LT 11 failed to distinguish a2A I-from a2A2-adrenoceptors (Table 1 and 2).",

            "text": "The molecular basis for the apparent heterogeneity among rat a2A-adrenoceptors is at present not clear. The most straightforward explanation is that azA-adrenoce ptors exist as two distinct species that are possibly coded for by different genes. This interpretation is supported by 'the observation that RG20 encodes a receptor which shows properties similar to those of the a2A2-adrenoceptor of rat tissues. However, other possibilities should also be considered. The a2A-adrenoceptors could, for example, be post-translationally modified so that some of them lost or aquired the ability to bind guanoxabenz with high affinity. Such a modification could involve a specific amino acid which interacts with guanoxabenz in the ligand binding pocket of the a2A-adrenoceptor. A prerequisite for this hypothesis is that the general structure of the receptor is not changed by this modification because none of the other 39 drugs tested were capable of the a2A1/a2Az-delineation. It should be pointed out that these possibilities are highly hypothetical and would have to be supported by the finding of conditions which give the expressed RG20 an affinity for guanoxabenz which corresponds exactly to that for the a2Al-adrenoceptor. On the other hand, the molecular cloning of a distinct and novel rat a2-adrenoceptor gene which, when expressed, yields a receptor with the a2Al-adrenoceptor properties is required to prove the hypothesis that a2A 1and a2A2-adrenoceptors are coded for by two different genes. Besides the RG20 gene in the rat, a number of other a2-adrenoceptor genes have been cloned. Of these the RGI0/pA2d genes (Lanier et al. 1991; Voigt et al. 1991) clearly code for an a2c-type of adrenoceptor (Uhl6n et al. 1992) . The RNG gene appears to code for an a2Btype of adrenoceptor (Zeng et al. 1990 ). Thus none of these rat genes are candidates for a putative a2Al-adrenoceptor gene. Chalberg and coworkers (1990) have cloned a gene, cA2-47, which is almost identical with RG20 albeit with minor sequence differences. The meaning of these minor differences are at present not clear but should prompt further investigations. At present only limited data are available regarding the pharmacological properties of the cA2-47 encoded receptor.",

            "text": "The consistency of the method used in the present study to determine drug affinities for the kidney a2A ~-adrenoceptors is indicated by the similar pKi-values obtained in our previous study where another approach was used (Uhl6n and Wikberg 1991 a). The drug pKi-values for a2-adrenoceptor subtypes determined in the present study do not represent agonist binding to high affinity forms of a2-adrenoceptors. We have previously shown that, with the spinal cord, the use of NaC1, Gpp(NH)p and EDTA totally eliminates the agonist high affinity binding sites of a2-adrenoceptors (Uhl6n and Wikberg 1991 b) . Moreover, the data for a number of other tissues indicate that these conditions will eliminate the high affinity agonist site of az-adrenoceptors (Michel et al. 1980; Snavely and Insel 1982) . Since the effects of Gpp(NH)p and EDTA are mediated via G-proteins and the effect of Na + is mediated by interaction with a specific aspartate residue (Horstman et al. 1991 ) which appears to be conserved among all G-protein coupled receptors, including all the a2-adrenoceptors cloned to date, it is conceivable that the inclusion of NaC1, Gpp(NH)p and EDTA will eliminate the agonist high affinity conformation for both U2A 1-and azAz-adrenoceptors. Since the results of the present study clearly indicate that the competition curves for strong agonists such as (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline are fitted best into models that assume one site for the azA-adrenoceptor, it is clear that our assay conditions essentially eliminate the agonist high affinity state of the a2-adrenoceptors. Thus, the major difference in apparent affinities of guanoxabenz for aZA 1-and aZAz-adrenoceptors is not due to the formation of agonist high affinity states. All the binding sites studied here clearly represent a2-adrenoceptors because they show the expected stereoselective binding properties for (+)-and (-)-adrenaline and the affinities expected of classical a~-and az-adrenoceptor blockers such as yohimbine, rauwolscine, corynanthine and prazosin. Since dopamine showed much lower affinities than either (-)-adrenaline or (-)-noradrenaline, the sites cannot be classified as being dopamine receptors. The sites labelled do not represent imidazoline-binding sites (\"I-receptors\") since these invariably show low nonstereoselective affinities for catecholamines as well as a negligible affinity for RX821002 itself (Wikberg 1989; Wikberg and Uhl6n 1990; Wikberg et al. 1991; Langin et al. 1990) . In this context, it should be mentioned that the RG20-adrenoceptor was originally classified as an \"a2Dadrenoceptor\" (Lanier et al. 1991 ) because its pharmacology was similar to that of the rat submaxillary gland a2-adrenoceptor (Michel et al. 1989) , the latter being placed in a category termed \"a2D\" by Bylund et al. (1991) . However, we believe there are reasons to abandon the nomenclature a2D. Our data show clearly that the RG20 encodes a receptor with pharmacology closely similar to that of the other adrenoceptors studied in the rat which we have classified as being a2A-adrenoceptors. The original reason to choose the nomenclature a2A for these receptors was that among the first rat a2-adrenoceptors that we classified according to subtype was the cerebral cortex az-adrenoceptor which, in accordance with the original subtype classification of rat cerebral cortex a2-adrenoceptors by Bylund (1985) , was classified as the a2A-type (Uhl6n and Wikberg 1991 b) . Since all the other receptors investigated in the present study showed pharmacological properties virtually identical with those of the cerebral cortex a2A-adrenoceptor, it seemed quite logical to classify them all as being of the a2a-type. A comparison of the data of our present study (Table 1) with the data reported for the submaxillary gland \"azi)adrenoceptors\" (Michel et al. 1989; Bylund et al. 1991) reveals that the receptors show virtually identical phar-287 macological properties. The main reason that the rat submaxillary gland a2-adrenoceptor was placed in a category of its own seems to be that it shows a fairly low affinity for rauwolscine, yohimbine or WB4101 when compared with aa-adrenoceptors of human origin that had earlier been classified as being of the a2A-adrenoceptor type (see Bylund et al. 1991; Michel et al. 1989 ). However, in view of the fact that the RG20 gene is closely similar to the human a2-C10 gene, which encodes an az-adrenoceptor with the human azA-adrenoceptor profile (Kobilka et al. 1987; Harrison et al. 1991 a,b) , it seems quite reasonable that RG20 and a2-C10 are species variants of the same a2-adrenoceptor gene. We therefore presently prefer to view our azA-adrenoceptors as being variants in the rat corresponding to the human a2Aadrenoceptor. Recent data of Link et al. (1992) provide strong evidence that a single amino acid change from (Cys 201 in the human to Ser 2\u00b0t in rodent azA-adrenoceptots), is responsible for the low affinity of yohimbine for the rat azA-adrenoceptor. The present discussion prompts the need for an improved, general method for the classification of receptor subtypes; the best approach for the future will probably be based on the structure of the receptors.",

The only drug which hitherto shows major selectivity for these two receptor forms is guanoxabenz. The present data, when combined with previous studies from our laboratory (Uhl6n and Wikberg 1991a; Uhl6n et al. 1992; Xia et al. 1993) , show that at least five forms of az-adrenoceptors are present in the rat: azAl, a2A2, a2B 1 and a2B 2 and a2c.",
