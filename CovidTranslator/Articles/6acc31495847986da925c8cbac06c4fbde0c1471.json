Therapeutic vaccines are often immune-modulating, agent-specific pharmaceuticals given after exposure, which protect the recipient from contracting the disease or diminish the severity of the disease. For example, researchers at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID, Fort Detrick, MD, USA) have developed two experimental therapeutic vaccines, which when given after exposure were capable of preventing Ebola and Marburg symptoms and lethality in guinea pigs and rhesus monkeys respectively 6, 7 . Juvaris BioTherapeutics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) is also developing or codeveloping several therapeutic vaccines against potential bioterrorism agents, such as anthrax, smallpox and the plague.",

Many companies, institutions and government agencies are working to reverse this situation. Even so, the rapidly changing landscape of public health priorities in infectious disease and necessary product attributes, such as high-volume administration, make biodefense a challenging area for development. The primary market drivers for development of vaccines and therapeutic agents against diseases on the CDC list of bioterror agents are the continued threat posed by domestic and international terrorists and the availability of government funding. Some bioterrorism agents are an ongoing threat in the developing world and are also threats to travelers. In this category are diseases, such as yellow fever, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid fever. Several vaccines in development, targeted to travelers, have been designed to protect against a combination of food or waterborne agents.",

These diseases are often diseases endemic to developing countries and are not generally recognized in developed countries. Also, many produce generalized 'flu-like' symptoms at the outset and may not be recognized as bioterrorism related until a large number of infected individuals are identified and tracked. The availability of broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals that could be administered before identification of the etiological agent would be beneficial to the general medical community. Many of the broad-spectrum antibiotics already approved and marketed have never been tested against the diseases on the CDC list of potential bioterror agents and efficacy is not assured. The incentives for the large pharmaceutical companies to test their products against the bioterror diseases are minimal, involving large, protracted clinical trials in remote locations for diseases without large patient populations. The larger pharmaceutical companies may be leery of liability issues and the negative impact of failed products on the company's stock or venture capital investments.",

BARDA may address some of these concerns, but it is too early to determine whether it will be effective.",
