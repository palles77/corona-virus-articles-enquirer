            "text": "Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates [1] constitute a group of compounds with a wide range of biological activities including antiviral, cytostatic, antiparasitic and immunomodulatory effects. The compounds with guanine or hypoxanthine as a nucleobase bearing (S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] [(S)-HPMP], or 2-(2-phosphonoethoxy)ethyl (PEE) chain have been reported as potential antimalarial agents [2] capable to inhibit the 6oxopurine phosphoribosyltransferase [3] of the Plasmodium parasite. In order to increase membrane permeability of above mentioned phosphonates, we have masked the ionic character of the drugs using the Hostetler's prodrug strategy [4] and hexadecyloxypropyl esters of 9-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]guanine [(S)-HPMPG], 9-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]hypoxanthine [(S)-HPMPHx], 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]guanine (PEEG) and 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]hypoxanthine (PEEHx) have been prepared. Their activities against Plasmodium are the subject of another study [5] . Herein we focus on their antiviral activities against various virus strains. Among the parent drugs, (S)-HPMPG has been reported [6] as an active compound against herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and type 2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and vaccinia virus (EC 50 in the mM range). The octadecyloxyethyl ester of (S)-HPMPG, a close analog of prodrug 16 in this study, has been reported [7] to display enhanced antiviral activity compared to the parent drug. Attachment of a highly lipophilic hexadecyloxypropyl moiety increases the cellular permeability as well as antiviral activities of the prodrug, probably due to the greater availability for cellular phosphorylation [4] . Thus strong antiviral activities of hexadecyloxypropyl esters of (S)-HPMPG against DNA virus strains can be expected. Also drugs previously found to be weakly active (PEEG) may show more pronounced activity after their conversion to hexadecyloxypropyl esters. Additionally, the structureeactivity relationship among various prodrug types (diester, monoester, cyclic monoester) is reported below.",

            "text": "For alkylation of the phosphonate function with the hexadecyloxypropyl moiety, we considered two approaches using PEEG as a model compound. The first is a broadly used methodology [8] involving in situ preparation of a bis chloridate followed by subsequent reaction with hexadecyloxypropyl alcohol in the presence of a base. The latter approach [9] involves neutralization of the phosphonate function with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide followed by nucleophilic reaction of the resulting phosphonate salt with hexadecyloxypropyl bromide. However, both methodologies afforded low yields of PEEG esters (<10%) due to the low conversion and the simultaneous alkylation of nucleobase. In order to circumvent these problems,we alkylated the acyclic phosphonate synthon which was subsequently coupled with an appropriate nucleobase. For the preparation of PEEG and PEEHx prodrugs, bis isopropyl phosphonoethoxyethylchloride [10] 1 was transformed to the free phosphonic acid and subsequently to bis chloridate which was treated with hexadecyloxypropyl alcohol in the presence of pyridine and triethylamine. Bis hexadecyloxypropyl ester 2 was isolated in high yield. The nucleophilic substitution reaction of alkylated phosphonate synthon with 6-chloropurine or 2-amino-6chloropurine in the presence of Cs 2 CO 3 as a base followed by acid catalyzed cleavage of the 6-chloro substituent afforded bis hexadecyloxypropyl esters of PEEG or PEEHx. Appropriate monoesters 5 and 6 were prepared by dissolving diesters 3 and 4 in DMF and heating in the presence of a nucleophilic agent (LiN 3 ) causing removal of one alkyl ester group [11] (Scheme 1).",

The alkylated phosphonate synthon was coupled with pre-prepared 9-(2-hydroxy-3-trityloxypropyl)-6-O-benzylpurine 11 or 9-(2hydroxy-3-trityloxypropyl)-2-amino-6-O-benzylpurine 12 in the presence of a base (NaH). Pre-preparation involved nucleophilic opening of the oxirane ring of (S)-(\u00c0)-glycidol trityl ether with 6-Obenzylpurine 9 or 2-amino-6-O-benzylpurine 10. The acid labile protective groups (OBn, OTr) of the resulting adducts were cleaved by the action of HCl. The diesters 13 and 14 were hydrolyzed in a solution of NaOH giving monoesters 15 and 16. Above mentioned method [11] using milder conditions resulted in incomplete conversion in this case. Intramolecular esterification of 15 and 16 mediated by PyBOP [13] afforded cyclic hexadecyloxypropyl esters 17 and 18 as a mixture of diastereomers (1:1 ratio according to the NMR spectra) (Scheme 2).",

Although the diester prodrug of PEEG (compound 4) lacked also activity against these DNA viruses, the monoester derivative (compound 6) was able to potently inhibit the replication of VZV, HSV and HCMV at EC 50 values in the range of, respectively, 0.14e0.30 mM, 1.4e2.8 mM, and 0.06e0.13 mM. Since compound 6 inhibited cell growth at a CC 50 (50% cytostatic concentration) value of 26 mM, selectivity indices (ratio CC 50 to EC 50 ) ranged from 9 to 433 depending on the nature of the virus.

However, the monoester and cyclic monoester derivatives of (S)-HPMPG proved more active and selective than the diester derivative. This observation supports previous assumption [4] that the phosphonate double-ester prodrugs penetrate the cell membrane less rapidly than their monoester counterpairs, even in case an ionized phosphonate group is present in the monoester prodrug. Thus, compound 16 (monoester) and compound 18 (cyclic monoester) inhibited VZV replication with EC 50 values in the range of 0.001e0.0025 mM for VZV, 0.007e0.09 mM for HSV, and 0.002e0.007 mM for HCMV. While the monoester derivative of (S)-HPMPG was inactive against feline herpesvirus, the cyclic monoester derivative was able to inhibit viral replication with an EC 50 of 0.43 mM. However, compound 16 proved more active than compound 18 against VACV (EC 50 \u00bc 0.011 mM for compound 16 compared to 0.13 mM for compound 18). As the monoester derivative of (S)-HPMPG (compound 16) proved significantly more cystostatic than the cyclic monoester (compound 18) with a CC 50 of 0.72 mM and 19 mM, respectively, SIs were 2-to 66-fold lower for compound 16 compared to compound 18. Thus, the cyclic monoester of (S) HPMPG showed the high selectivity among all the prodrug tested with SIs in the range of 2700e19,000 for VZV, 211e559 for HSV, 3800e9500 for HCMV, and 146 for VACV.",

Even compounds, such as 6 and 16, that are charged in physiological conditions are able to penetrate the cell membrane since they presented significant antiviral activity.

Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU). After a 1e2 h adsorption period, residual virus was removed, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virusinfected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM cells (w3 \u00c2 105 cells/cm 3 ) were infected with 100 CCID 50 of HIV-1(IIIB) or HIV-2(ROD)/ml and seeded in 200-mL wells of a 96-well microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds. After 4 days of incubation at 37 C, HIV-induced CEM giant cell formation was examined microscopically.",

            "text": "Cytotoxicity measurements were based on the inhibition of cell growth. HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 \u00c2 10 3 cells/well into 96well microtiter plates and allowed to adhere and proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After 3 days of further incubation at 37 C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC 50 , or the compound concentration required reducing cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls. CC 50 values were estimated from graphic plots of the number of cells (percentage of control) as a function of the concentration of the test compounds. Alternatively, cytotoxicity of the test compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology. Selectivity indexes were calculated as the ratio CC 50 to EC 50 .",
