The amount of medical waste generated in primary health care centers was much higher than that in secondary hospitals, which may be attributed to general waste being mixed with medical waste. This study found that the level of the HCF, responsibility for medical waste management in departments and wards, educational background and training experience can be factors that determine medical staff members' knowledge of health care waste management policy. Regular training programs and sufficient provision of protective measures are urgently needed to improve occupational safety for cleaning personnel. Financing and administrative monitoring by local authorities is needed to improve handling practices and the implementation of off-site centralized disposal in primary health care centers.",

According to a survey of the World Health Organization (WHO) on health care waste management in 22 developing countries, the proportion of health care facilities (HCF) with inappropriate waste disposal methods was between 18% and 64% (WHO, 2005) . To improve health care waste management, several previous studies in developing countries indicated the importance of a national regulatory framework (Askarian et al., 2004; Massrouje, 2001; Phengxay et al., 2005; Shinee et al., 2008) , a sound internal management system and training program for related personnel (Abdulla et al., 2008; Da Silva et al., 2005; Mohee, 2005 Danchaivijitr et al., 2005 , estimation of health care waste generated (Bdour et al., 2007; Tsakona et al., 2007) and appropriate techniques for disposal (Diaz et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2004; Rogers and Brent, 2006) .

According to interviews, the implementation of the management system was accompanied by increasing financial investment in internal storage locations, equipment, occupational education, and final disposal that were beyond the affordability of most primary health care centers. With health system reform based on a market economy, governmental subsidies to HCF have decreased, causing severely limited financial resources in primary health care centers (Liu et al., 1995) . This may explain the poor performance of primary health care centers and suggests that local authorities should financially subsidise primary health care centers.",

Operations did not comply with standards related to environmental protection. Health care waste was often observed to be inappropriately discarded or mixed with domestic waste, creating a high potential risk to public health and the environment. Results confirmed the advantage of off-site disposal in terms of administrative monitoring and supervision: tertiary and secondary hospitals implementing off-site centralized disposal had completed consignment notes with which the local environment agency was able to monitor the management system and handling processes; conversely, primary health care centers disposed of health care waste on-site and had no records.

The amount of such waste was much higher in primary health care centers (1.17 kg/bed/ day) than in secondary hospitals, which coincides with a previous study in Laos PDR (Phengxay et al., 2005) . The current study found that this larger amount can be attributed to domestic waste being mixed with health care waste in the separation and collection process.

Financing and administrative monitoring by local authorities is urgently needed to improve handling practices and implement off-site centralized disposal. In terms of occupational education and safety, HCF should provide sufficient training programs and protective measures to all relevant personnel, including non-staff members such as cleaning personnel. Training programs in primary health care centers should be varied to meet the needs of personnel and to improve their understanding of the management system.",
