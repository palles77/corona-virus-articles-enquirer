We find that interventions aimed at halting transmission in children may have minimal effects on preventing cases depending on the relative transmissibility of subclinical infections. Our estimated age-specific clinical fraction has implications for the expected global burden of clinical cases because of demographic differences across settings. In younger populations, the expected clinical attack rate would be lower, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will affect disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with older populations may see disproportionally more clinical cases, particularly in the later stages of the pandemic.",

We used setting-specific demographics, measured contact matrices where possible, and synthetic contact matrices otherwise 27 . The age-dependent clinical proportion was markedly lower in younger age groups in all regions (Fig 2b) , with 20% of infections in children under 10 resulting in clinical cases, rising to over 70% in adults over 70 in the consensus age distribution estimated across all regions. To determine whether this distribution was capable of reproducing epidemic dynamics, we fitted our dynamic model to the incidence of clinical cases in Beijing, Shanghai, South Korea and Italy ( Fig 2c ) . The consensus age-specific clinical fraction was largely capable of reproducing the age distribution of cases, although there are some outliers, for example the 20-30 age group in South Korea. This could be the result of clustered transmission within a church group in this country 4 . The predicted age distribution of cases for Italy is also less skewed towards older adults than reported cases show, suggesting potential differences in age-specific testing in Italy 28 .

These differences have a large effect on how effective school closures may be in limiting transmission, delaying the peak of expected cases, and decreasing the total and peak number of cases.

Our results show that these demographic differences, coupled with a lower symptomatic fraction in younger ages, can result in proportionally fewer clinical cases than would be expected in higher-income countries with flatter demographic pyramids. This should not be interpreted as few cases in LMIC, because the projected epidemics are still very large, resulting in high numbers infected. Moreover, the particular relationship found with age here is drawn from high income countries, primarily in East Asia, and may reflect not only age, but also the increasing frequency of comorbidities with age. This relationship, therefore, may differ in LMIC for two key reasons: first, the distribution of non-communicable comorbid conditions-which are already known to increase the risk of severe disease from COVID-19 21 may be differently distributed by age, often occurring in younger age groups 34 , along with other possible risk factors such as undernutrition 36 ; and second, communicable comorbidities such as HIV 33 , TB coinfection (which has been suggested to increase risk 37 ), and others 38 may alter the distribution of severe outcomes by age. Observed severity and burden in LMIC may also be higher due to a lack of health system capacity for intensive treatment of severe cases.",

The true explanation for the age distribution could be a combination of age-specific susceptibility and clinical fraction, although some recent studies indicate children are infected at similar 24 , or slightly lower rates 39 than adults, and children are not commonly spared from other coronavirus infections 40, 41 . It is not possible to simultaneously estimate both effects from available data, so we were unable to validate a mixture model. While information drawn from the early stages of the epidemic are subject to uncertainty, age-specific information is drawn from several regions and countries, and clinical studies support the hypothesis presented here. We assumed that clinical cases are reported at a fixed fraction throughout the time period, although there may have been changes in reporting. We assumed that subclinical infections were less infectious than clinical infections but were not able to estimate how infectious subclinical infections were, instead testing the sensitivity of our findings to this parameter. We have used mixing matrices from the same country, but not the same location as the fitted data. We used contact matrices that combined physical and conversational contacts. We therefore implicitly assume that they are a good reflection of contact relevant for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. If fomite, or faecal-oral routes of transmission are important in transmission, these contact matrices may not be representative of transmission risk.",

We aggregated the last three categories into non-school contacts and estimated how components of the contact matrix changed early in the epidemic in response to major changes. Schools closed on January 12th for the Lunar New Year holiday, so we decreased school contacts, but the holiday period may have changed non-school contacts, so we estimate this effect by January 23rd 2020 giving restrictions on travel and movement imposed by authorities, and we inferred the change in contact patterns during this period,",
