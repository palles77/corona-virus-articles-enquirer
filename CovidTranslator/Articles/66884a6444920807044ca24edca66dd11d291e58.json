            "text": "Several mathematical models of smallpox (variola virus) outbreaks have been proposed. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] All have appropriate information to offer public health response planners, although their conclusions vary due to differing assumptions and statistical methods. The models attempt to minimize outbreak morbidity and mortality through various vaccination policies and procedures. Smallpox vaccination complication rates with the currently available live vaccinia virus are of significant concern to individuals and public health response planners. More recent information on vaccination complication rates, especially for healthcare workers (HCWs), is now available from the experience of vaccinia virus vaccination in the USA over the last five years. Combining the more recent knowledge on vaccination complications and potential immunologic mechanisms with Summary As healthcare institutions are a focus of smallpox transmission early in an epidemic, several mathematical models support pre-event smallpox vaccination of healthcare workers (HCWs). The deciding factor for HCW voluntary vaccination is the risk of disease exposure versus the risk of vaccine adverse events. In a United States military population, with careful screening to exclude atopic dermatitis/eczema and immunosuppression, over 1 million vaccinia (smallpox) vaccinations were delivered with one fatality attributed to vaccination. Among 37 901 United States civilian volunteer HCWs vaccinated, 100 serious adverse events were reported including 10 ischemic cardiac episodes and six myocardial infarctions -two were fatal. This older population had a higher rate of adverse events due to age-related coronary artery disease. T-cell mediated inflammatory processes induced by live vaccinia vaccination may have a role in the observed acute coronary artery events. With exclusion of individuals at risk for coronary artery disease, atopic dermatitis/eczema, and immunosuppression, HCWs can be smallpox vaccinated with minimal risk. A carefully screened multidisciplinary cadre (physician, nurse, infection control practitioner, technician), pre-event vaccinated for smallpox, will supply the necessary leadership to alleviate fear and uncertainty while limiting spread and initial mortality of smallpox. # 2007 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

No model can be truly predictive, no one control measure identified as best, but evidence exists for the prevaccination of HCWs prior to the first recognized case.",

In their computer simulation, the hospital had 686 workers (a relatively small facility compared to many tertiary care institutions) and 133 of these made close contact with smallpox cases prior to the initiation of isolation measures. Of 828 cases, 50% originated in the hospital and 13% of the contacts were untraceable. Preemptive smallpox (vaccinia virus) vaccination of 10% of the hospital workers, in addition to surveillance and containment, had a small effect on the average number of cases; however, preemptive vaccination of 50% of the hospital workers had a relatively large effect on case reduction. The larger number of preemptive vaccinations required less contact tracing and 'ring' containment vaccinations. A delay of one day in fully implementing surveillance and containment resulted in a large epidemic.",

Due to an effective education and deferral program for those with a history of atopic dermatitis/eczema or immunosuppression, there were no cases of eczema vaccinatum or progressive vaccinia. A detailed description of the first 450 293 vaccinations (70.5% primary and 29.5% revaccinations) in the initial five months of the program which commenced on December 13, 2002, has been published. 16 The National Smallpox Preparedness Program sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) primarily ran January through October 2003 and was targeted to civilian HCWs and public health response teams. During this time period, 37 901 civilian volunteers received vaccinia Dryvax TM vaccination and 100 suffered serious adverse events. 17 In this significantly different population from military members, 64% of the vaccinees were women. More than 75% of the vaccinees were between 40 and 64 years of age and had previously received vaccinia vaccination. The serious events included 21 cases of myopericarditis and 10 cardiac ischemic events. The 10 ischemic events included four cases of increased angina and six myocardial infarctions with two fatalities among women, ages 55 and 57 years old, one and four days after vaccination, respectively. The interval between vaccination and cardiac symptoms was seven to 14 days with a median of eight days in the majority of cases. Two cases of insidious onset dilated cardiomyopathy occurred two to three months after vaccination. Statistically speaking, the rate of ischemic cardiac events in civilian vaccinees did not appear to exceed the rate in a comparable unvaccinated population. The older revaccinees had a higher risk of adverse events due to age-related underlying chronic disease, especially coronary artery disease. Among the nearly 38 000 live virus vaccine recipients, there was no transmission of vaccinia to others; specifically, no nosocomial transmissions occurred.",

A vaccinia virus-induced inflammatory response may have a role in acute coronary events following smallpox vaccination. Supporting evidence for generalized inflammation post vaccination includes vigorous cytotoxic T-cell and interferongamma (IFN-g) responses after the appearance of inoculated vaccinia skin vesicles. 20 In 107 na\u00efve volunteers receiving the Aventis-Pasteur vaccinia formulation, levels of INF-g, interleukin (IL)-10 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) were significantly elevated with dramatic increases in INF-g at one week in nearly 50% of cases. 21 A vulnerable atheromatous plaque contains T-lymphocytes, macrophage foam cells, and 'activated' intimal smooth muscle cells. In patients with fatal myocardial infarction, the acute plaque rupture site is marked by a coordinated 'cross talk' inflammatory response of these cells. Tlymphocytes activate the macrophages, and T-cell activation is likely an important mechanism in the pathophysiology of the acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Unstable plaques show a tenfold increase in T-cell content by PCR indicating specific antigen driven recruitment of T-cells in unstable lesions. Marked INF-g upregulation can be observed in unstable plaques and the consequent Th1 response (INF-g, TNF) may have a critical role in the outcome of the lesions. 22 Fracture of the atheromatous plaque's fibrous cap is best understood as a mechanism for an acute coronary event. Inflammation causes various forms of plaque disruption including endothelial cell death due to cytolytic attack by activated killer T-cells. Most of the tensile strength of the fibrous cap is conferred by interstitial collagen molecules. Collagen production by smooth muscle cells can be inhibited by proinflammatory cytokines such as INF-g. 23 The above immunological data support a possible mechanistic link between smallpox vaccination and acute myocardial infarction in high-risk ACS individuals several days after smallpox vaccination; further study in this area is warranted. Smallpox vaccination deferral in individuals with multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is certainly a prudent policy. Older essential HCW personnel with cardiac risk factors desiring smallpox vaccination may consider a cardiac exercise stress test to detect high-grade atherosclerotic coronary plaques.",

The possible increased incidence of vaccinia pericarditis with an atopic history noted by the Finns in the 1970s may hold a clue to the pathogenesis. 14 The immunology of vaccinia virus in the dermis offers insight into the adverse reactions in individuals with atopic dermatitis and the complication of eczema vaccinatum. The live virus inoculation method by scarification (multiple superficial punctures to the skin with a bifurcated needle) induces a diffuse dermal immunologic response. Langerhans cells, at the base of the epidermis, are implicated as antigen processing sites, and replication of the vaccinia virus in the lower epidermis is important to developing effective immunity. The skin of atopic individuals involves multiple abnormal immunologic responses including increased expression of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4. 24 Atopic individuals also have keratinocytes producing abnormal chemokines favoring Th2 lymphocyte production of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13. Higher levels of IL-4 inhibit production of INF-g; lower levels of INFg contribute to the overgrowth of the vaccinia virus.",
