De Clercq in 1986 of broadspectrum antiviral activity of (S)-HPMPA [9-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine] and PMEA [9-[2-(phosphonome thoxy)ethyl]adenine] led to a new family of nucleotides designated as acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANP) [1e4],. ANPs are nucleotide analogs that are characterized by the presence of a phosphonate group linked to a pyrimidine or purine base through an aliphatic linker. Three of these are approved drugs for the treatment of severe/fatal infectious diseases and represent three different types of ANPs: (i) HPMP derivatives such as (S)-1-[3hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]cytosine (HPMPC, cidofovir (Vistide \u00d2 )] which is approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients [5] ; (ii) PME derivatives such as PMEA [adefovir (in its oral prodrug form, adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera \u00d2 )] for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infections [6] , and (iii) PMP derivatives such as PMPA [tenofovir (in its oral prodrug form, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread \u00d2 )] is used for the treatment of HIV infections (AIDS) and hepatitis B virus [7] . From these data, it appears that small chemical alterations in the acyclic side-chain lead to marked differences in antiviral activity and the spectrum of activity of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates against various classes of viral agents [1] .",

In our search for antiviral compounds, we synthesized a new class of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates based on a 4-phosphono-but-2-en-1-yl base motif in which the oxygen heteroatom has been replaced with a double bond having trans stereochemistry [8] . We have shown that this modification allows mimicry of the three-dimensional geometry provided by the backbone of PMEA, PMPA, and CDV while maintaining an electronic contribution similar to that brought by the oxygen atom [8] . Several new derivatives are efficiently activated by human thymidylate kinase (hTMPK), and the best substrates were converted to bis-(pivaloyloxymethyl)ester phosphonate prodrugs and found to be active against several herpes viruses in cell culture.",

The removal of the Boc group requires oftentimes harsh conditions (e.g. trifluoroacetic acid, trimethylsilyl iodide, hydrochloric acid in ethyl acetate, potassium carbonate, etc.) that are not compatible with the POM moiety.

[17, 18] have demonstrated good activity in various RNA viral infections. In a first attempt, we struggled to introduce the pyrazine moiety through direct N-alkylation of 10 with the corresponding (E)-4-phosphonobut-2 0 -en-1 0 -yl bromide (9) , in the presence of K 2 CO 3 in anhydrous DMF, (Pathway A). Unfortunately only the bis(POM)-but-1,3-dienyl phosphonate 9 0 resulting from undesired bromine elimination was obtained, (Scheme 3). Thus, we decided to reach the pyrazine phosphonate analogs 13, 14 following the same strategy developed for the cytosine derivatives, (Pathway B). Starting from the 3hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide 10, the N 1 -Crotyl-3-oxo-pyrazine-N 3 -bis-Boc-carboxamide 11 was obtained in 49% yield, via the two step crotylation/N-Boc-protection. Next, N 1 -crotyl-3-oxo-pyrazine-N 3 -bis-(Boc)-carboxamide 11 in CH 2 Cl 2 was treated in the presence of bis(POM)-allylphosphonate 1 and (NHC)Ru]CHR Nolan's catalyst 3 to give the desired product 12 in 22% yield. To obtain the carboxamide 14, we first applied our previous described methods, using ceric ammonium nitrate and CH 3 CNeMeOH (1:1) . Surprisingly, the methylester 13 was isolated as the major compound in 47% yield. Thinking that the presence of the undesired product 13 was due to the use of methanol as co-solvent, the preparation of the desired amide 14, was achieved in CH 3 CN using ceric ammonium nitrate in 25% yield.",

The olefin cross metathesis of bis(POM)allylphosphonate with (E)-1,4-dibromobut-2-ene catalyzed by catalyst 3 afforded (E)-4-bromo-bis(POM)-allylphosphonate (9) in 88% yield.
