Before the worldwide availability of vaccines, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and Haemophilus influenzae type b were identified as the main bacterial causes of pneumonia [1, 2] . Now, viruses are more commonly detected in patients with acute respiratory infections including pneumonia [1, 3, 4] . [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . While the use of sensitive PCR methods has significantly expanded the ability of laboratories to detect and identify pathogens, the clinical association between pathogen detection and disease remains difficult to interpret when considering viral shedding, replication and persistence of nucleic acids present during the pre-or post-syndromic phase of infection in the absence of comparison groups [3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 14] . Without comparing to control groups, the clinical relevance of identifying some respiratory pathogens by PCR testing remains difficult to determine [3, 4, 11, 12, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

Most of the viral pathogens evaluated in this study were found to be associated with mild or severe disease irrespective of HIV status. Nonetheless, the magnitude of this association varied between pathogens. Our study suggest that influenza, RSV and hMPV infections are highly associated with severe respiratory illness in South Africa relative to controls, especially in children <5 years of age, which mirror the findings of Self et al. [12] . While rhinovirus and adenovirus had the lowest estimated AF the estimated detection rate attributable to illness remained high indicating that, while these viruses could act both as pathogen and bystander, they could also be responsible for a substantial proportion of severe disease. RSV, rhinovirus, adenovirus, hMPV and influenza were the most common pathogens causing disease among SARI cases, especially in children <5 years of age.",

RSV has been well documented as the leading cause of viral pneumonia in children <5 years of age [1, 22] , but is also increasingly recognized as a cause of severe disease in adults [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Several studies have shown that RSV infection is an important cause of illness in the elderly (\u226565 years) and high-risk adults, with a disease burden similar to that of non-pandemic seasonal influenza [26,28]. Although we found that RSV was associated with disease among both children and adults, modeling studies conducted in South Africa have not found excess mortality or hospitalizations associated with RSV among adults [29, 30] . This apparent contradiction may relate to the fact that the burden of RSV among older adults in South Africa may be too low to be detected in modeling studies.",

Several studies have reported the high positivity rate of rhinovirus in asymptomatic individuals and none so far have been able to give a clear indication of rhinovirus' role in severe respiratory infection, although several have suggested that rhinovirus can act as both a bystander and a pathogen [12, [31] [32] [33] [34] .

First, several viruses were detected at low prevalence in the control group which would account not only for the high adjusted relative risk ratios but also for the wide confidence intervals. Second, comparing detection rate of pathogens among symptomatic patients with controls does not prove or disprove disease association in individual patients. Other approaches such as viral load and host interactions are needed to determine what role some of these viruses play in severe respiratory disease, while taking into account factors such as replication or persistence of nucleic acids present during the pre-or post syndromic phase of infection. Third, we did not adjust for the potential role of bacterial infections as this information was not available. The role of bacterial super-infection on severe illness following a viral infection cannot be excluded. Last, whereas on multivariable analysis we adjusted for the HIV serostatus of the individuals enrolled in this study, we were not powered to provide estimates of the AF stratified by HIV due to the low detection rate of certain pathogens within each stratum.",
