            "text": "A 33-year-old man was working in Liberia as a health-care worker since October 2013. He took his daily prophylaxis against malaria infection. By April 2014, he and his team had established an Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia, Liberia. In July 2014, he woke up feeling feverish and tired. He measured his temperature and found that he was slightly febrile with a temperature of 37.8 \u00b0C when measured through a thermometer placed in the mouth (the normal temperature is 37.4 \u00b0C). He informed his colleagues of his illness and stayed at his local residence in Liberia. Two rapid malaria tests were negative for identification of malaria infection. With the passage of time, his fever got worse, heightening to a body temperature of 38.6 \u00b0C. He also felt nauseated.",

            "text": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Lassa fever, yellow fever, and Ebola virus disease were all negative at the time. As his fever continued, he was treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. On day 4 of his illness, tests were repeated for malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever, and Ebola virus. This time, the test demonstrated that he had Ebola virus disease. It is not uncommon for initial tests to be negative in very early Ebola virus infection because the amount of virus is too small to be detected in the blood. 1 On day 6, he developed a petechial (spotty bluish) rash on his arms and chest. These rashes usually represent bleeding from small blood vessels under the skin. His fever spiked to an all-time high of 40 \u00b0C. He had severe abdominal pains and diarrhea. He had an episode of bloody stool and was subsequently transfused with a single unit of blood. Later on, his rash has turned into a maculopapular rash (a mix of flat and raised red bumps like lesions). 1 On day 7, he was vomiting blood for which he was given another blood transfusion. He also received a unit of convalescent whole blood from an Ebola virus disease survivor. Despite the convalescent whole blood transfusion, his condition continued to worsen. For his fever and muscle pains, he received a gram of generic Tylenol every 6 h. He was given Tang and Gatorade to hydrate himself by mouth because of concerns regarding dehydration in the face of continuing vomiting and diarrhea. He appeared malnourished partly due to the severe anorexia. 1 On day 9, a dose of intravenous Zmapp was administered, an experimental antibody-based treatment described in more detail in other chapters. Within 8 h of administration of Zmapp, he reported improvement in his energy level to the point that he was able to walk. The extent of his rash had decreased significantly as well. The professionals caring for him reported improvements in his fever and level of alertness. 1 On day 10, he was transferred to Emory University's Communicable Diseases Unit in Atlanta, Georgia, for treatment. On day 11, he had slight fever with a temperature of 38.8 \u00b0C, heart beating fast with 120 beats per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 91%. Oxygen saturation is measured through a monitor taped to one of the fingers and measured the approximate concentration of oxygen in blood by measuring the wavelengths of light passed through arterial blood. The normal value is 95-99%. He was started on 2 L of supplemental oxygen administered via inhalation and resulted in improvement in saturation to 93%. Normally, a resonating sound is heard when lungs are percussed, but there was a dull sound coming from his lungs on percussion, indicating that the low oxygen reading could be a result of inadequate oxygenation of blood because the lungs were not working well. He was severely dehydrated, and low blood pressure and rapid heart rate were recorded every time he stood up. His physical examination showed no obvious bleeding but the persistence of the same petechial rashes. He described pain after a manual pressing of the abdomen during examination, specifically in the right upper quadrant. His liver was not enlarged. 1 He had some abnormalities detected on laboratory analysis. His internationalized normal ratio (a test of coagulation parameters) was 1-3, which is elevated and means that blood coagulation was delayed. He was found to have low potassium in serum, commonly seen with diarrhea, which was normalized with oral supplementation. Intravenous and oral fluids were continuously administered to treat dehydration. He received oral protein drinks and a multivitamin pill to improve his nutritional status. 1 On days 12 and 15 of his illness, he received additional doses of Zmapp without any side effects. On day 15, his fever disappeared. Between days 14 and 17, the watery diarrhea was resolving, and volume and frequency of his bowel movements were normalizing. On day 17, the diarrhea had completely resolved and he no longer required intravenous fluids. 1 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were performed on his blood and it came back consistently negative. After negative PCR tests, it was decided on day 29 to remove him from isolation unit. He was discharged home the following day. 1 The case presented above displayed certain characteristics that are seen in patients suffering from Ebola virus disease. A typical case will occur in a patient with no significant past medical history. The patients may report having been in contact with a stranger suffering from Ebola virus disease or a sick loved one. Since exposure, the patient will usually begin displaying symptoms within 8-12 days, although there is a possibility that the virus infection may not show symptoms for up to 21 days. The disease begins abruptly, patients feeling vague symptoms, a general sense of being unwell, and warm or under-the-weather. Patient can transmit disease to the people around them when these features are present. 1 Within a short period of time, typically 1-4 days after initial symptoms, the patient will begin to complain of high fever, chills and shakes, profound weakness, and muscle pain. Some may describe these new occurrences as intense shaking. Weakness is sometimes so severe that the patient cannot even walk to the restroom. The muscle pain can be so severe that the patient does not want to move. Early signs of infection can be evident in the blood as the white blood cell count becomes elevated. White blood cells are elevated because, after being exposed to the infectious agent, the body signals a boost to the defense system. The white count rise is a marker of bodily response to combat the virus. 1 Immediately after these symptoms and around 4-8 days after the symptoms initially start, patients can develop diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, red eyes, bleeding, and, rarely, a rash. Patients can lose 20 L of body fluid a day from the severity of the diarrhea and vomiting, causing severe dehydration. The nausea is so bad that the patient can barely take fluids or food by mouth, making replacement of lost fluids and dehydration a challenge. The laboratory measurement of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine provides an estimate of the severity of the dehydration. These substances can be thought of as normal wastes that the body makes. These wastes are delivered to the kidney by the fluid portion of blood. After these wastes reach the kidneys, the kidneys dump these out of the body into the urine.",

Normal electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and chloride tend to be decreased in patients with Ebola virus disease due to enormous loss of fluid when the patients are constantly vomiting and having diarrhea. Potassium is mostly lost with diarrhea, and chloride is mostly lost with vomiting. 1 About one in five patients may progress to experience massive bleeding between 6 and 16 days, which can manifest as blood in vomit or blood in diarrhea, making dehydration even more severe. The main blood cell responsible for blood clotting, platelets, start decreasing in the body due to Ebola virus disease. Platelets normally serve to initiate a temporary plug at a site of bleeding. Without platelets, there is a higher chance of bleeding, which explains the bleeding symptoms in Ebola virus disease patients.",

Signs of liver failure may be evident in blood tests with accumulation of normally produced liver enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which are normally made inside liver cells. When liver cells are diseased, the cells die and dump AST and ALT into the blood, increasing the concentration of these enzymes. The elevation in Ebola virus disease patients may be either due to the direct attack of virus of these cells or severe dehydration that does not allow for enough blood to be delivered to the liver cells, causing them to die.",

Although the invaders were not going to receive any reinforcements, they were multiplying in numbers within the comfort of the confiscated resources at a rate that was unprecedented and out of this world. As the invaders rapidly traveled through the country under the guise of their victims, the defending armies were unable to mount a targeted offense to contain and destroy the invaders. The communications between defending units remained sporadic and ineffective. When the defending armies responded with massive artillery barrage, but without clear targets, the damage inflicted upon their own comrades exceeded the damage suffered by the invaders. The towns were left vulnerable and were quickly overrun by the ever-increasing numbers of invaders; these turned into ghost towns devoid of life and hope.

These cells become the vehicle of viral transport into various organs but, unfortunately, are not immune to the destructive effect of the virus. Ebola virus replicates rapidly within these cells, leading to their deaths with subsequent releases of large numbers of new viral particles into the extracellular fluid upon cell destruction. 3,4 Regional lymph nodes, which usually function to trap any infectious agent, capture the virus but things get worse when virus continues to replicate in lymph nodes, eventually leading to the destruction of this important defense line.",

Necrotic cells also signal the release of such chemicals. This response kills more of the body's cells than the virus, resulting in extensive tissue damage and inducing a systemic inflammatory syndrome. 3, 4 High concentrations of such compounds in the blood lead to dilation of blood vessels, pooling of blood into various blood vessels, and exudation of fluid into the tissue, causing life-threatening loss of blood pressure and subsequent multiorgan failure as adequate perfusion to such organs is not possible. The condition is also referred to as septic shock to denote the etiological basis of a profound drop in blood pressure. Vomiting is another bodily defense mechanism and leads to loss of body fluids. Due to vomiting, patients are unable to take oral fluids and the psychological stress causes loss of appetite. In addition to the above-mentioned inflammatory substances, these are some other important factors that can contribute to the critical decrease in blood pressure.",

Ebola virus infection macrophages also produce some chemicals medically known as cytokines. Cytokines also induce production of tissue factors. Cytokines and tissue factors cause inappropriate and false activation of platelets and other proteins that are involved in blood clotting. This false activation leads to blood clotting that ultimately consumes a lot of platelets and other proteins. Due to depletion of platelets and proteins involved in normal clotting process, the body becomes prone to excessive bleeding and hemorrhages.

In the later stages of the infection, excessive bleeding may be evident as ecchymosis/bruising, petechial, oozing from venipuncture sites, and mucosal hemorrhages from nose and gastrointestinal systems. Frank hemorrhages such as bleeding from the nose, rectum, and vagina are seen most commonly in the terminal phase of illness. In the current outbreak, not less than 20% of patients have suffered bleeding, with gastrointestinal tract bleeding being the most common. 2, 14 Myalgia, arthralgia, and fatigue-All viral diseases produce myalgia and fatigue of varying severity. The severe myalgia and fatigue may be secondary to dehydration and uremia seen in acute kidney failure. Poor nutritional status is another contributor to such manifestations. Antigen-antibody complexes are formed during the recovery phase, which may lead to acute arthralgia and other symptoms similar to those seen in autoimmune arthritis. 3 Psychological symptoms-Ebola virus disease, like any other untreatable condition, has devastating psychological stress on patients. With its high mortality rate and no proven treatment, patients are more likely to suffer from depressive symptoms. Lack of family support due to the risk of exposure increases the load of mental health problems. Major depression, social withdrawal, loss of appetite, suicidal ideations, and attempts to commit suicide have been reported in patients suffering from Ebola virus disease. 15 Miscellaneous findings-Ebola virus disease can present with findings such as difficulty in breathing, pain in the chest, headache, hiccups, confusion, seizures, and swelling in the brain. Redness of eyes and redness of the soft palate are common findings. 13 Several of these manifestations are a result of multiorgan failure rather than the direct effect of virus dissemination into muscles or the central nervous system. Spontaneous miscarriages may occur in pregnant women.",

It cannot be readjusted after entering the patient care area because any further manipulation with the protective equipment can result in breach of barriers against virus. A trained observer should monitor this activity to ensure proper compliance. After handling the body fluids of the infected person, the gloved hands should be disinfected using an alcohol-based hand rub. During patient care activities, if the health-care worker experiences a partial or total breach of their personal protective equipment (through glove separation from sleeves leaving exposed skin, a tear in an outer glove, or a needle stick), then the health-care worker should be moved instantly to the designated area to evaluate the degree of exposure. If indicated during evaluation, the facility's exposure plan should be implemented emergently. In comparison to putting on protective gear, the removal of used personal protective equipment is a high-risk process that requires an organized approach, a trained observer, and a selected area for removal to warrant protection.

During the disposal process of used personal protective equipment, human error or omission can be expected. To prevent such occurrences, every step is read aloud to the health-care worker from the procedure worksheet, and each completed step is visually established and documented by a trained observer. The exclusive responsibility of a trained observer during entire put-on and takeoff process is to ensure the safety of the health-care worker and to make sure the facility is not compromised.
