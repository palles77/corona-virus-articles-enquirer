The typical presentation of pertussis is quite distinct from that of bronchiolitis (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . However, for both pertussis and bronchiolitis most of the severe illness occurs in young infants, both can present as apnea, and pertussis can manifest atypically in partially or fully vaccinated children. Also, the epidemiology of pertussis and bronchiolitis is distinct with pertussis causing cyclical epidemics every 2 to 5 years with increasing incidence in recent years and bronchiolitis epidemics occur annually during the fall and winter months. Complicating these distinctions is viral co-infection with RSV or other respiratory viruses frequently detected in infants with B. pertussis infection (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . We recently conducted a prospective, multicenter study of 2207 children hospitalized for bronchiolitis during three consecutive winter seasons (2007 to 2010) in the United States (US) (14) . An objective of the study was to identify the putative respiratory pathogens in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. In this report we describe the prevalence of B. pertussis infection in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis from November through March and describe their clinical presentation and hospital course.",

There is a strong interest in defining the role of B. pertussis in children with bronchiolitis in the current era because in both diseases the incidence is highest in infants, they cause life-threatening illness, symptoms can be atypical in young infants and have overlapping features in older infants, there are conflicting data on the prevalence of B. pertussis in bronchiolitis, and molecular diagnostics have improved the detection of B. pertussis. In the current study, we used modern molecular diagnostic methods to demonstrate that B. pertussis is an uncommon pathogen in bronchiolitis. The study population consisted of 2207 U.S. children hospitalized with bronchiolitis during three sequential respiratory seasons from 2007/2008 to 2009/2010.

Approximately 80% of bronchiolitis-associated hospitalization occurs in children less than 12 months with an annual hospitalization rate in 2009 of approximately 25 per 1000 person year or an average of 105,000 hospitalizations (27) .

In more recent years there has been a trend for decrease in bronchiolitis hospitalization but with an increase in children with co-morbid medical conditions (27) . Children younger than 6 months are particularly vulnerable to severe bronchiolitis, with approximately 57% of all bronchiolitis-associated hospitalization occurring in this group or an annual average of 84,900 hospitalizations. Extrapolating from our study of 4 cases of B. pertussis in 1405 bronchiolitis-associated hospitalization among infants less than 6 months, we would predict approximately 240 cases of B. pertussis occur each respiratory season among U.S. infants less than 6 months who are hospitalized for bronchiolitis.

The CDC developed a clinical case definition to increase the likelihood of detecting pertussis, in particular, in situations when testing is not performed or laboratory tests are negative (16, 17) . In endemic or sporadic cases, like those observed in our study, the clinical case definition of pertussis is met when a child has a history of a coughing illness at least 2 weeks in duration with paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory whoop or post-tussive emesis without other apparent cause. In our study, 52 children met the CDC clinical case definition of pertussis but only two had laboratory confirmation. Two other children in our study who did not meet the CDC clinical case definition of pertussis had laboratory confirmation. This is consistent with the observation that young infants with B. pertussis can present with atypical symptoms including apnea, cyanosis and wheezing (9, 12, 16) . Of note, three of the 4 children with laboratory confirmed pertussis had a viral co-infection.

            "text": "Laboratory confirmation of pertussis can be difficult depending on when persons are tested in the course of their disease and the type of laboratory method used. Leukocytosis early in the illness is characteristic of pertussis but occurs in the minority and is not specific for pertussis (9, 11, 30) . The four infants with pertussis in our study presented with leukocytosis, with the WBC in all four being greater than 19,000 per microliter. PCR is considered the preferred test for confirmation of pertussis because of its increased sensitivity compared with other tests (11, 16) . Not all PCR tests are created equally and some assays can give false positive results because of the region the primers target. For this study we used real time PCR with primers that target the insertion sequence IS481. B. pertussis and B. holmesii are the main species that contain IS481 with nearly 10 times as many copies found in the genome of B. pertussis compared with B. holmesii (19) . A low percentage of B. bronchiseptica strains are also known to contain the IS481 gene. B. holmesii has been recovered in children with pertussis like syndrome (31) . A large cohort study in Europe was conducted to determine if B. holmesii confounds PCR assays that target IS481 and IS1001 (32) . Among 11,319 persons with pertussis like syndrome who were evaluated, 1581 (14%) persons were confirmed to have pertussis based on positive PCR tests. None of these persons were positive for B. holmesii using a species-specific real time PCR test that was based on the recA gene. All together the data suggest that B. holmesii is infrequently detected in persons confirmed to have pertussis based on PCR test that targets IS481.",

The sites involved are representative of academic hospitals and not community hospitals, and we oversampled for children admitted to the intensive care unit. Both of these factors might affect the prevalence of B. pertussis in children with bronchiolitis-associated hospitalization. Another possible limitation is that B. pertussis was confirmed with a single real time PCR test. A second PCR test is often used to exclude other Bordetella species. It is possible that one or more of these cases might have been due to B. holmesii. Lastly our study was restricted to the months of November through March of each study year. Although most cases of bronchiolitis occur from November through March, the prevalence of pertussis was not determined in those cases that occurred outside the study period.",

The clinical findings of pertussis in partially vaccinated infants can be atypical, may not meet the CDC definition of probable infection, and co-infection with a respiratory virus can add an additional challenge in making a diagnosis of pertussis. In children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, B. pertussis should be considered in young infants who are slow to improve with conservative management and have an elevated WBC. Making an accurate diagnosis in young infants is important because they are vulnerable to the most severe consequences of pertussis and account for the majority of pertussis deaths. ",

Similarly Walsh et al. detected three cases (0.6%) in 488 samples collected primarily from infants evaluated in the emergency department during the 2005-06 RSV season in Los Angeles (2). Dual infection with RSV was identified in 2 of the 3 children with pertussis. In a study conducted in Switzerland from November 2008 through October 2009, Heininger and Burckhardt identified 21 (1.9%) cases of pertussis from 1059 nasopharyngeal samples collected from children age 0 to 17 years evaluated for a coughing illness (3). Other investigators have identified B. pertussis as a common pathogen in children with bronchiolitis or RSV (4-7). Two studies conducted in Finland in infants less than 6 months of age hospitalized for a respiratory tract infection in 2005-06 (4) or bronchiolitis in 2001-02 (5) identified B. pertussis in 9 (10%) of 88 and 12 (8.5%) of 142 infants, respectively. Co-infection with RSV occurred in 15 of these 21 infants with pertussis. Miron and colleagues reported on the etiology of bronchiolitis in 490 hospitalized children less than 2 years of age during the 2005-06 winter in northern Israel (6). B. pertussis was detected in 29 (6.2%) hospitalized children with 3 of the pertussis cases as the sole pathogen. Cosse-Lambe and colleagues reported B. pertussis in 19 (16%) of 120 infants less than 4 months of age hospitalized for bronchiolitis during the 2005-06 winter in Paris(7).The variation in prevalence of B. pertussis in children presenting with bronchiolitis among the cited studies might be a reflection of the country's incidence of pertussis and the vaccination rate against pertussis.",

It jumped in 2010 to 27,550 cases and remained elevated in 2011 at 18,719. In 2006, ACIP recommended routine use of Tdap among adolescents 11 to 18 years of age. At least 34 states reported increased pertussis activity in 2010 despite the increase in pertussis vaccine coverage among adolescences",
