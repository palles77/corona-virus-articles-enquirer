My information technology adviser told me to put it through my dishwasher at home and allow it to dry out before reconnection. I did as suggested, and dried the keyboard out on top of the boiler. Afterwards, the keyboard worked perfectly. Furthermore, as the water had been close to 70 C for several minutes, most, if not all, of the vegetative bacteria on the keys would have been killed.",

This finding may be of some importance because it would enable a 'safe zone' (or, perhaps more correctly, a safer zone) to be created close to the patient. The creation of such a zone would be a significant advance because it would enable nurses and doctors to attend to the patient's needs in relative safety, provided that they stayed within this area. Perhaps the area of the safe zone could be marked out on the floor?",

These larger droplets, which may contain infectious virus, tend to fall to the ground within 1e2 m of the patient, whereas the smaller droplets evaporate rapidly to form nuclei that can remain airborne for many hours. 2 It is unclear from Kao and Yang's work whether or not the movement of these larger droplets was simulated. Being relatively heavy, the effect of room air currents on these larger droplets is much less than that on droplet nuclei, and they tend to be removed from the air by gravitational deposition. They are nonetheless of considerable importance as a number of infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, are known to be transmitted by the droplet route. In order to protect HCWs in regions close to the patient, it is necessary to ensure that they are not exposed to these larger respiratory droplets. We would therefore encourage Kao and Yang to consider this issue in their future work.",

In our investigation, only coughs producing larger droplets (z30 mm) were considered for the requirements of isolation rooms used for non-airborne diseases, e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome. However, the results provided reasonable physical evidence that the appropriate airflow patterns with suitable operating parameters, e.g. 12 air changes/h, which dominates the average velocity inside the isolation rooms, can create a relative safe zone for staff. The value of 12 air changes per hour is determined by engineering experiments and specified in our national specifications (CDC of Taiwan) for the installation of hospital ventilation systems. In addition, our proposed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique is a simple and readily available method for analysing the air within isolation rooms that are subject to coughs producing larger droplets.",

            "text": "Furthermore, in our opinion, CFD still has some difficulty in simulating realistic cases of airborne diseases, such as a cough that produces smaller droplets. Realistic simulations would require complex conditions and physical models, and would be restricted by limitations of numerical models for various situations inside the isolation rooms, e.g. the effect of evaporation for droplets, a long-time computational model for tracing each nucleus (micro-particles), and the problems of mathematical instability for the CFD techniques. The physical mechanism for droplet nuclei drying out during the transition of virus dispersal by airflow patterns inside the isolation rooms is not clear. For coughs producing smaller droplet nuclei, we suggest that alternative approaches are more suitable, i.e. tracer containment testing. 2, 3 As suggested by Profs Beggs and Kerr, in order to mark out the relative safe zone inside an isolation Letters to the Editor",
