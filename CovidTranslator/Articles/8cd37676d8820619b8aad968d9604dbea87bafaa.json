With respect to the etiology and pathogenesis of epulides, they are often related to chronic mechanical irritation or to chronic gingival inflammation with development of excessive amounts of granulation tissue and sometimes fibrous neoplasms. Spontaneous epulides are very rare in laboratory rodents, but they may be induced by prolonged administration of calcium channel blockers. The development of tracheal cartilage degeneration and inflammation of the sero-mucinous glands of the oropharynx may be a factor causing early mortalities in long term studies with Fischer-344 (F-344) rats. The presence of these lesions was investigated in groups of male and female F-344 rats killed at 6, 19 and 32 weeks of age. Half of the rats killed at 19 and 32 weeks of age were sham treated with water (pH 10) by daily oral gavage for a duration of 13 or 26 weeks prior to autopsy in order to detect any influence on the laryngo-tracheal cavity due to dosing technique. A clear age-associated increase in severity and incidence of chondroid degeneration of the tracheal and laryngeal cartilage was revealed, with an onset as early as 6 weeks of age. After 19 weeks, a high frequency of oropharyngeal granuloma formation was found. No relationship of the lesions to the gavage technique was apparent. The F-344 rat strain may possess a predisposition for inflammatory and degenerative changes in the oropharyngeal and laryngo-tracheal cavity, changes which can lead to increased and unexpected mortality rates in nonclinical safety studies (1).",

Most of these tumours contained large central masses of keratin and were classified microscopically as cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. Two of the neoplasms showed only limited features of malignancy. Their histological structure was characterized by a large mass of lamellated keratin which contained a small amount of cellular debris and was surrounded by a thin rim of stratified squamous epithelium. They were sharply demarcated from the surrounding pulmonary parenchyma and had some projections into the central keratin mass of epithelial cells. In significant portions of the wall, the cells had variations in size, shape, orientation, nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and increased mitotic figures which were restricted to the basal layers. In the tumours with more pronounced malignant features, the central keratin was enveloped by epithelial cells that frequently revealed papillary or solid projections into the keratin. The tumours were not well demarcated. Focally, stratification of the epithelium was lost and the cells were irregularly arranged. Pleomorphism of the cells was marked and mitotic figures were frequent. A high incidence of granulomatous pneumonia was observed in 5 of 6 sources of rats. Only the BN-rats from Harlan, UK showed no granulomatous pneumonia. Great interindividual differences in the severity of pneumonia were noted in rats of the other breeders. A close relationship between granulomatous pneumonia and influx of eosinophilic granulocytes as a possible predisposition for an allergic response was evident in all animals effected. The great variability of the severity grade of pneumonia in all analysed rat sources, with the exception of rats from Harlan UK, questions the reproducibility of experiments of different laboratories with this animal model.

Ultrastructurally the most prominent feature was basement membrane thickening of choroidal and intraretinal vessels, the retinal pigment epithelium and the inner limiting membrane. We also found evidence of degeneration of pericytes and medial smooth muscle cells and few occluded intraretinal capillaries. The neuronal compartment was mostly degenerated; surrounding glial Muller cells and astrocytes were hypertrophic and showed a dramatic increase of cytoplasmic intermediate filaments. The peripheral nerves showed evidence of diabetic autonomic polyneuropathy as described in animals and humans. Retinal vessels of human and animal eyes are characterized by non-fenestrated continuous endothelial cells with tight intercellular junctions, which form the blood-retinal barrier (BRB). Breakdown of the BRB is one of the hallmarks of diabetic retinopathy, and is responsible for macular oedema, the most common cause of visual morbidity in human diabetic patients. This breakdown of the BRB may be also in this case the cause for retinal lesions. After a single high oral dose of a new drug rats died at day 1 until 6. They showed a distended abdomen as a leading symptom. Gross pathology: The jejunum and the ileum were extremely dilated, reddened and filled with a large amount of viscous mucus. The proximal part of the small intestine and the colon appeared normal. The mesenterium was edematous. Histology: The inflammatory reaction (macrophages/granular leukocytes) was mainly observed in the mesenterium and its insertion at the intestine, spreading to the serosa, the muscular layers and the submucosa. The vessels were dilated. The mucosa seemed to be involved secondarily. The villi were shortened and deformed with dilated capillaries and lymphatics. The number of goblet cells were markedly increased, obviously producing masses of mucus. In the forestomach and the glandular stomach some ulcers were found. In the corresponding 4 week toxicity study in general the same changes to a lesser degree were observed. Some animals showed goblet cell hyperplasia, others, lacking the goblet cell hyperplasia, revealed more Paneth cells. Conclusion: In a rat single dose toxicity study and a subacute study, respectively, the distal part of the small intestine was found to be a target organ with peritonitis, congestion, hypersecretion of mucus and decreased tonus of the intestinal wall but continued peristalsis. In a commercial rabbitry with more than 10 000 crossbred (meat hybrid) animals, an increased mortality rate of about 20 % was observed in rabbits short after weaning and moving into the fattening house. Most of the dissected animals had shown a brief period of diarrhea before death, while the remaining died without previous clinical symptoms. Tetracyclin therapy was unsuccessful.",

The naturally occurring nitrile l-cyano-2-hydroxy-3butene (CHB) represents a breakdown product ofthe glucosinolate progoitrine that is found in many cruciferous plants. As a derivative of hydrocyanic acid CHB is toxic to several animal species. In a risk assessment study about plant nitriles CHB was administered to several inbred and one outbred rat strain in order to evaluate the acute toxicity. Oral doses of 50-100 mg/kg can lead to death cases within 24 hours. Necropsy reveals an acute pancreatitis with colliquative necrosis of the exocrine parenchyma. The necrosis is combined with a significant decrease of the glutathione metabolism of the pancreas. Inbred rat strains like BDElHan, DAlHan or LEWlHan react more sensitive than the outbred Wistar strain.",

The application of 1cyano-2-hydroxy-3-butene possibly forced the formation of autoantibodies against the exocrine pancreas, which is described in diabetic BB-rats, resulting in an autoimmune reaction with destruction of the cells. Using light microscopy, we observed lipomatous lesions in the liver of three out of 4300 CBA/J mice in a transgenerational carcinogenesis study. Only female mice without treatment were affected. The mice were killed at 84/85 or 103 weeks of age in a moribund condition by CO 2 , Macroscopically pale white foci were described in the liver of one animal while in two of the cases a 5 mm pale white nodule was seen. These two nodules showed a distinct compression of the normal liver tissue microscopically. The proliferated cells were smaller than hepatocytes with dark oval nuclei. Some of these cells were spindle-shaped and had pale eosinophilic cytoplasm. The majority of the tumour cells contained vacuoles of different size. Signs of malignancy could not be observed. DIXON et al. (1994) have published similar findings in the liver of B6C3Fl mice. They discovered this lipomatous lesion in thirteen out of 90.000 mice re-evaluated from the database and although the authors could not determine its exact cellular origin, an \"Ito cell proliferation\" was discussed. The animal investigated was a 6-months-old female guinea pig which had died without clinical symptoms.",

            "text": "The microsomal enzyme aromatase is localized in the follicular granulosa cells and catalyzes the conversion of androstenedione (4-androstene-3, 17 -dione) into estrone. In the present study an inhibitor of this enzyme was administered to female mature NMRI mice for 13 weeks by gavage.At necropsy no compound-related macroscopic findings or changes in the weights of ovaries and uterus were noted. However, histological examinations of ovaries revealed a marked loss of corpora lutea and a reduction in the number of follicles. Some remaining follicles showed cyst formation of their cavum. Furthermore, a pronounced atrophy combined with a marked cytoplasmic foamy vacuolation (\"luteinization\") of the ovarian interstitial glands was observed. Atrophy of the ovaries was in contrast to findings in uterus, cervix and vagina. In the uterus the luminal and glandular epithelium showed hypertrophy and hyperplasia, partially with cystic dilatation of glands. Endometrial stroma had predominantly spindle-shaped cells with focal areas of fibrosis. The cervix and vagina had hyperplastic squamous epithelium with inclusions of cornified epithelial cells. In some areas an incomplete cornification of the superficial layers was detected. Focal infiltration of neutrophils was chiefly located in the superficial epithelial layers.The morphological changes in the uterus, cervix and vagina indicated an estrogenic effect on these organs. The pathogenesis of the compound-induced changes is not completely elucidated. The aromatase inhibitor led to a decreased synthesis of endogenous oestrogens leading to a lowered hormone level and inducing the bilateral ovarian atrophy. The pronounced vacuolation of inter-stitial ovarian cells may be ascribed to the accumulation of oestrogen precursor steroids. However, marked estrogenic effects were observed in the remaining female genital tract. Since the aromatase inhibitor has no estrogenic activity it could not contribute to this effect. Presumably the observed cystic follicles in the ovary were secreting low amounts of estrogens continuously which, in conjunction with the lack of progesterone (no corpora lutea), resulted in an estrenism-like condition. The slide came from an individual animal which died in week 89 in a carcinogenicity study. This animal had a large red brown nodule in one liver lobe. The abdominal cavity of this animal contained fresh blood. Microscopic examination revealed that this nodule was compatible to a lesion previously described as Kupffer cell sarcoma.The tumor consisted of large pleomorphic cells with abundant cytoplasm growing along the liver plates and forming cystic blood filled spaces. Multinucleated cells, pleomorphic nuclei, and occasional erythrophagocytosis was noted. In some classifications this tumor is considered to be a SUbtype of hemangiosarcoma. The ultrastructure and immunocytochemistry of these cells will be presented.",
