Moreover, the Customs Code contains provisions that govern customs officers in their fight against drug crimes and the proceeds of such crimes (2) . Although each country has its own laws and regulations, which its Customs Service authorities enforce, in most countries, Customs Service is attained through government agreements and international laws. Customs officers are considered as 'high-demand' and 'high-responsibility' governmental officials, which constitute members of multidisciplinary teams at the local, as well as international level and collaborate with different authorities, including medical officers (3, 4) . Their careers are characterized with professionalism and involve multiple tasks, including securing the borders and preventing drug smuggling, while enforcing immigration laws, protecting agriculture, and ensuring trade compliance, and preventing illegal entry of individuals and prohibited goods. Customs officers are also involved in detecting and preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the country, as well as in preventing the illegal trafficking of individuals, narcotics and contraband. Customs officers can work at airports, at docks, or any major land port of entry.",

Despite the limited effectiveness of these screening measures, they were resource-intensive and innovative at that time, following modern international travel.

These measures included the containment triage of febrile patients at front-line healthcare settings, the admission and isolation of confirmed cases, mandatory quarantine orders for close contacts, temperature screening at border entry points and mitigation strategies (14) . Moreover, recommended health policies from many countries included customs officers to the 'high-priority' professional groups for pandemic A/H1N1 influenza vaccination. The decision analytical computational simulation of economic modelling, developed by the University of Crete School of Medicine in collaboration with the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB), demonstrated that when implementing a pandemic A/H1N1 influenza vaccination program among customs officers in Greece with a participation rate of only 30%, influenza vaccination was not cost-saving in any of the studied influenza scenarios (15) . When the participation rate reached 100%, the program was cost-saving, when the influenza attack rate was 30% and the symptomatic rate 65%. However, in that study, the estimated mean net cost-benefit value in 2009/2010 period was -7.3 euros/customs officer.",

In March 1994, health authorities in Antwerp, Belgium, were informed that a member of a team of 15 customs officers had been admitted to hospital with Chlamydia psittaci-induced pneumonia. His symptoms began at 10 days following his exposure to parakeets that had been imported illegally by an Indian sailor. He was 54 years of age and his diagnosis was based on the presence of antibodies against Chlamydia psittaci in his blood analyses. A necropsy of one of these parakeets revealed pericardial lesions typical of Chlamydia psittaci infection. Further investigation revealed that among the team of customs officers, who had possibly been exposed to the birds, another 6 customs officers, who had been in contact with the birds while they were held in the customs office, developed atypical pneumonia; in two of these cases, psittacosis was confirmed serologically. The risk of contracting psittacosis was 2.8-fold higher in officers exposed for >2 h to parakeets than for those briefly exposed. This outbreak emphasized the need for the preventive measures in Customs Service for the customs officers handling suspicious import or export goods. These measures included relevant procedures for handling, transporting and captivity of confiscated birds, supply of protective clothing for customs officers at risk of potentially infectious contact, their health education and their strengthened medical surveillance in collaboration with occupational health services.",

For environmental exposure, hearing loss can be caused by long-term, continuous exposure to noise; however, it can also result from single or repeated sudden noise exposure, which is generally referred to as acoustic trauma. Exposure to excessive noise is the most common preventable cause of hearing loss. Exposure to sudden impulse noise is more detrimental than exposure to steady state noise. Customs officers, particularly the group of radar operators, gunsmiths and shooting instructors, have been proposed to be vulnerable to noise-induced hearing loss (31) .

            "text": "Customs officers and diesel engine emission. In 2003, a five-year survey of Swiss customs officers by Gl\u00fcck et al (32) , evaluated the adverse effects of the chronic exposure of customs officers to diesel engine emission (DEE). Their study recruited 194 non-smoking customs officers, from where brush nasal cytology probes were taken twice a year over a period of 5 years. Among these officers, 136 were solely occupied with the clearing of diesel trucks, where measured DEE concentrations varied between 31 and 60 \u00b5g/m 3 and benzo[a]pyrene concentrations were between 10 and 15 ng/m 3 . In contrast to those working only in the office, customs officers exposed to DEE were diagnosed with chemical-induced chronic inflammation of their nasal mucosa, characterized by clear goblet cell hyperplasia with increased metaplastic and dysplastic epithelia and an increase in leukocytes. Additionally, the findings of metaplastic and dysplastic nasal epithelia in the exposed officers may indicate a genotoxic effect of chronic DEE exposure in humans. in two customs officers employed in two depositories of confiscated cigarettes, of which one exhibited signs of dampness. These symptoms included dyspnea, cough, fever, tiredness and malaise. Microbiological sampling of the air and the cigarettes stored in a damp depository revealed the presence of potentially pathogenic fungi and bacteria and the biochemical markers of bacterial lipopolysaccharide and fungal biomass. The Penicillium species (P. simplicissimum, P. inflatum, P. commune) dominated in the damp depository, while in the other one Aspergillus fumigatus was prevalent. The patients under study did not exhibit a specific sensitization to microbial allergens in the precipitin test, the test for inhibition of leukocyte migration and the bronchial provocation challenge, apart from a weak reaction to fungal allergens in the test for inhibition of leukocyte migration. Moreover, one patient responded with subjective symptoms following exposure to the inhalation of increased doses of the P. simplicissimum antigen. Both cases were diagnosed as a specific form of organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS). It was hypothesized that the symptoms were evoked most probably by the non-specific action of low molecular fungal metabolites, such as mycotoxins or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with the possible contribution of bacterial endotoxin. However, as there is no a direct evidence to support this presumption and the effects of nicotine and other tobacco constituents cannot be excluded, further studies are required in order to elucidate the etiopathogenesis of the disorders associated with the exposure to stored tobacco.",

In their study, the majority of the customs officers were best described by the non-compensatory heuristic, whereas the majority of the novices were best described by a compensatory strategy. Experts often rely on one-reason decision making and that expert-novice differences in strategy selection may reflect a response to the internal representation of the environment. The study by Prunier et al (37) performed in Paris, France, compared the effects of different shift schedules used by French Customs Units. Notably, the officers working 4x6-h shifts reported a high proportion of sleep difficulties and digestive disturbances; their situation was very similar to that of officers working 3x8-h shifts and contrasted markedly with that of officers working 2x12-h shifts and day workers. This was attributed to the irregularity of eating habits imposed by four different shifts, the greater number of working days in the week, and the frequent assignment of two shifts on the same day were concluded as critical etiological factors.",

In 2003, during the SARS pandemic outbreak, customs officers contributed to the institution of border control measures, inhibiting or attenuating its international spread. Similarly, in 2009, customs officers played a significant role in the international public health control measures implemented to limit the spread of pandemic. The environmental risk for customs officers includes noise-induced hearing loss, exposure to diesel engine emission and stored tobacco and occupational stress due to their increased time-schedule and decision-making duties. Without any doubt, further assessment of the health status of customs officers is required in order to evaluate and decrease their environmental and occupational risk.",
