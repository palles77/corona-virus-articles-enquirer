Despite the global and local efforts, the virus 41 escaped the healthcare measures and rapidly spread in China and later globally, officially 42 causing a pandemic and global crisis in March 2020. At present, different scenarios are being 43 written to contain the virus, but the development of novel anticoronavirals for all highly 44 pathogenic coronaviruses remains the major challenge. Here, we describe the antiviral activity 45 of previously developed by us HTCC compound (N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium 46 chitosan chloride), which may be used as potential inhibitor of currently circulating highly 47 pathogenic coronaviruses -SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. : bioRxiv preprint 65 pneumocytes in human airways, hijacking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to 66 enter the cell, similarly as SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63. 67 MERS-CoV is related to SARS-CoV-2, but together with some bat viruses forms 68 a separate Merbecovirus subgenus. Bats are believed to serve as an original reservoir also in 69 this case 10 , but camels were identified as the intermediate host 11 . The virus never fully crossed 70 the species border, as the human-to-human transmission is limited, and almost all the cases are 71 associated with animal-to-human transmission. The entry receptor for MERS-CoV is the 72 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) 12,13 . In humans, MERS-CoV causes a respiratory illness with 73 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The mortality rate varies between locations, but at present, is 64 estimated to reach 3-4% globally. The virus infects primarily ciliated cells and type II severity varying from asymptomatic to potentially fatal acute respiratory distress [14] [15] [16] . To date, 74 MERS-CoV infection was confirmed in 27 countries, with over 2,000 cases and a mortality rate 75 of ~35%. 76 Currently, there are no vaccines or drugs with proven efficacy to treat coronavirus 77 infection, and treatment is limited to supportive care. However, a range of therapeutics have Consequently, broad-spectrum antivirals are essential in long-term perspective. we dissected the mechanism of the HTCC antiviral activity.

The inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 119 cells was even more pronounced, and all HTCC variants inhibited virus replication by ~10,000 120 times at non-toxic concentration (Figure 1B, C) .

We hypothesize that the selectivity of the inhibitors yields from the fitting 185 charge distributions on the polymer and on the S proteins on the viral surface. While the 186 interaction of a single charged moiety is relatively weak, the concatemeric nature of the virus 187 and the polymer stabilizes the binding. Such structure-based interaction may be an interesting 188 entry point for further fine-tuning of the polymeric inhibitors of viral replication. 189 To ensure that the observed effect was a result of coronavirus entry inhibition by HTCC, 190 two experiments were performed. First, HAE cultures were inoculated with MERS-CoV in the 191 presence of HTCC-63 (200 \u03bcg/ml) or control PBS and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Next, cells 192 were fixed, immunostained for MERS-CoV N protein and actin. Virus entry was analyzed with 193 confocal microscopy. To visualize the effect, the signal attributed to intracellular MERS-Coronavirus internalization into susceptible cells is hampered by HTCC. (A) Pre-cooled HAE cultures 199 were incubated with ice-cold MERS-CoV suspension in the presence or absence of HTCC-63 (200 \u03bcg/ml) for 2 h 200 at 37\u00b0C. Next, cells were fixed in PFA and immunostained for MERS-CoV N protein and actin. Virus entry was 201 analyzed with confocal microscopy.

Here, we employed a surrogate system based on lentiviral vectors 211 pseudotyped with full-length Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. A549 cells overexpressing the 212 ACE2 protein were incubated with pseudovirions harboring SARS-CoV-2 Spike or control 213 VSV-G protein in the presence of HTCC-77 (100 \u03bcg/ml) or control PBS for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. After 214 72 h p.i. cells were lysed, and pseudovirus entry was quantified by measurement of the reporter 215 GFP protein.

While the interaction of the monomer is relatively weak, and no inhibition 245 is observable for monomers, the sum of interactions stabilizes the binding and specific 246 inhibition is observed. Considering that the extended chain length for the HTCC used is 247 ~700 nm this scenario seems realistic 27 . If that would be true, HTCC would constitute a first 248 structure-specific inhibitor of viral replication. The major disadvantage of the HTCC is that, at 249 present, it is not registered for use in humans. However, previous experience with HTCC in 250 different laboratories shows that it may be delivered topically to the lungs, it is not associated 251 with toxicity, and it does not worsen the lung function 25 .
