In addition, we describe recent findings on the regulation of immunity, pulmonary inflammation and injury during virus infection.

These populations include two main resident mature (MHC class II hi CD11c hi ) respiratory DC subsets, which are characterized as CD103 + and CD11b hi CD103 \u2212 respiratory DCs and are crucial for the induction of adaptive immune responses, at least in mice [14] [15] [16] [17] . CD103 + respiratory DCs localize at the mucosal surface, adjacent to the respiratory epithelium, and surround adjoining vasculature. By contrast, the more abundant CD11b hi respiratory DC subset is found within the lung interstitium. CD103 + respiratory DCs express the mannose-binding Ctype lectin langerin (also known as CLEC4K) 16, 18 and require expression of specific transcriptional factors (such as BATF3) for their normal development in the lung and at other mucosal surfaces [19] [20] [21] .

These receptors are crucial for transendothelial migration of activated respiratory DCs and their egress to the draining lymph nodes 14, 15, 30, 31 . Unlike CD103 + and CD11b hi respiratory DCs, other potential APCs -such as alveolar macrophages, pDCs and monocyte-derived DCs -use as yet unidentified pathways that are independent of CCR7 to enter the draining lymph nodes. Activated respiratory DCs also upregulate their expression of co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules (such as CD40, CD80, CD86 and ICAM1) and of antigen-presenting molecules, and this renders the migrating respiratory DCs competent to serve as potent APCs for the activation of naive virus-specific T cells in the draining lymph nodes.",

It is noteworthy that a burst of T cell-derived IL-10 production was shown to occur at the time of the initial influx of effector T cells into the lungs. This burst coincides with the peak of production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IFN\u03b3 by the CD8 + effector T cells and with the onset of virus clearance 65 . IL-10-producing effector CD8 + T cells have been shown to simultaneously produce the proinflammatory cytokine IFN\u03b3, and the production of both of these cytokines by CD8 + T cells decreases with virus clearance 65 . It remains to be determined whether this transition from an effector T cell capable of producing pro-inflammatory cytokines in the draining lymph nodes to an effector T cell that can produce both pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines after entering the virus-infected lungs represents a change in the activation state or in the differentiation state of the activated T cell. However, an examination of IL-10 production by CD8 + effector T cells in vivo in infected lungs 66 revealed that the production of this regulatory cytokine required exposure of the T cells in the infected lungs to IL-2 derived from antiviral CD4 + effector T cells and IL-27 produced by inflammatory mononuclear cells and neutrophils. These and other observations 67 favour the view that the exposure of CD8 + effector T cells to pro-inflammatory (IL-27) and survival (IL-2) stimuli in the infected lungs enhances T cell activation, thereby facilitating Il10 gene expression.",

According to this analysis, CD8 + T cell cytotoxic activity had the least stringent requirement for co-stimulatory and cytokine signals, followed by T cell proliferation, with proinflammatory cytokine production requiring the strongest costimulatory signals. Very recently, evidence has emerged from an in vivo analysis of T cell responses to respiratory virus infection to support this concept 49 . In this study, effector CD8 + T cell activation by influenza virus-derived antigens that were presented by infected CD45 \u2212 respiratory epithelial cells resulted in T cell-mediated killing of the infected epithelial cells without the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By contrast, effector CD8 + T cell activation by viral antigens that were presented by interstitial CD45 + inflammatory cells (primarily LY6C hi CD11c + inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes) induced cell-mediated cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the effector CD8 + T cells. The mechanism (or mechanisms) that account for this difference in the T cell response to APC or target cell recognition remains to be fully elucidated.",

Indeed, blockade of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in vitro or in vivo suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by effector CD8 + T cells without affecting their cytotoxic activity in vitro or virus clearance in vivo 49 . Thus, the engagement of co-stimulatory receptors on effector CD8 + T cells by APCs would provide the additional signal strength necessary for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the T cells. Several reports have evaluated the contribution of specific co-stimulatory receptor-ligand interactions in regulating the host adaptive immune response and the outcome of respiratory virus infection [70] [71] [72] [73] . However, in most instances no specific distinction was made between the contribution of these co-stimulatory receptor-ligand interactions during the induction phase of the response in the draining lymph nodes and during the effector phase in the infected lungs.",

Following respiratory virus infection, T Reg cells in the lungs have been shown to express 'effector' T Reg cell markers. For instance, the expression of the T H 1 cell-associated transcription factor T-bet is upregulated in lung T Reg cells during influenza virus infection 65 and is associated with enhanced T Reg cell-mediated suppression of excessive T H 1-type inflammatory responses 79 . Similarly, BLIMP1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1; also known as PRDM1), which is required for the terminal differentiation of effector T cells, is necessary for the enhanced production of IL-10 by T Reg cells during influenza virus infection 65, 67 . The depletion of T Reg cells leads to excessive pulmonary inflammation and injury during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection [80] [81] [82] . Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of T Reg cells into recombination-activating gene (RAG)-deficient mice (which lack B and T cells) controls the otherwise lethal inflammation mediated by innate immune cells during influenza virus infection 83 . These data suggest that T Reg cells may be crucial for controlling acute host inflammation and for restoring lung homeostasis following respiratory virus infection, although the mechanisms underlying these functions are poorly understood.",

Alveolar macrophages from lungs infected with type A influenza virus show increased expression of the CD200 receptor (CD200R), ligation of which suppresses alveolar macrophage activation in response to secondary bacterial challenge 100 . Furthermore, alveolar macrophages from virus-infected lungs exhibit decreased expression of the scavenger receptor MARCO (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure) and a diminished ability to ingest bacteria 99 . They also produce only low levels of the cytokines and chemokines required for orchestrating the responses of other cell types against bacterial infection, such as neutrophil recruitment and activation 98 . The diminished chemokine production by alveolar macrophages from virus-infected lungs is associated with decreased translocation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) to the nucleus of alveolar macrophages as a result of as yet unidentified mechanisms 98 . The desensitization of alveolar macrophages can last for several months after influenza virus infection. Therefore, given the important role of alveolar macrophages in the initial control of bacterial infection, these data suggest that individuals who have recovered from severe influenza virus infection may have compromised immunity to subsequent bacterial infections for extended time periods.",
