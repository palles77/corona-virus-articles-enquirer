The questionnaire focused on perceived threat, vulnerability, severity, response efficacy, and self-efficacy related to SARS and eight other diseases. Results Perceived threat of SARS in case of an outbreak in the country was higher than that of other diseases. Perceived vulnerability of SARS was at an intermediate level and perceived severity was high compared to other diseases. Perceived threat for SARS varied between countries in Europe and Asia with a higher perceived severity of SARS in Europe and a higher perceived vulnerability in Asia. Response efficacy and self-efficacy for SARS were higher in Asia compared to Europe. In multiple linear regression analyses, country was strongly associated with perceived threat. Conclusions The relatively high perceived threat for SARS indicates that it is seen as a public health risk and offers a basis for communication in case of an outbreak. The strong association between perceived threat and country and different regional patterns require further research.",

The behavior of the general population or specific risk groups can play an important role in both the spread and control of infectious diseases. The SARS epidemic showed the impact of worldwide travel on the rapid spread of an epidemic, as well as the possible merits of strict hygiene and quarantine measures in halting that epidemic [3] . In case of an infectious disease pandemic, public health authorities will be dependent on the willingness and ability of the general public to adhere to recommendations regarding personal hygiene, vaccination and/or prophylaxis, quarantine, travel restrictions, or closing down of public buildings such as schools [4, 5] . Compliance with recommended precautionary behaviors is not self-evident [6] . Specific attention to factors influencing behavioral change during outbreaks of infectious diseases is, therefore, necessary.",

Perceived vulnerability, combined with perceived severity, can be regarded as perceived threat. People are expected to have the highest perceived threat of SARS if they think that an infection with SARS is likely and will have serious health consequences. However, risk perception is certainly not the only determinant of protective behavior. Protection Motivation Theory suggests that response efficacy (i.e., the extent to which people believe that available protective actions against SARS are effective) and self-efficacy (i.e., the extent to which people believe they have the ability to engage in such protective actions) are two other key predictors of protection motivation [8] .",

Related to emerging infections diseases, first, explorative and descriptive studies are needed to increase our insights in perceived threat, risk perception, and efficacy beliefs. Such studies can inform more focused and theory-driven investigations. During and in the aftermath of SARS, several of such exploration studies have been conducted, but these studies did not include international comparisons across a range of different countries. These studies showed that the risk of SARS was perceived differently across the globe and was not directly linked to the proximity of the outbreak. Risk perception of SARS in some of the Asian countries was relatively low compared to risk perception in the USA [13] [14] [15] but similar to levels reported for The Netherlands [16] . One study focused on differences in psychosocial factors predicting preventive behavior in four affected regions [17] . Ji and colleagues compared optimism related to SARS in China and Canada and concluded that both groups demonstrated unrealistic optimism, while at the same time they were overly pessimistic about their own chances of getting infected [18] . A limited number of studies have looked at risk perception of avian influenza with different results varying from high perceived risks to low risk perception [19] [20] [21] [22] . A Dutch study showed high levels of risk perception of avian influenza in case of an outbreak and indicated that almost 40% of respondents had taken some sort of precautionary measures [23] .",

To make the scores comparable, the severity score was first divided by two. To normalize the skewed distribution of the new variable, a square root transformation was performed that resulted in a measure of perceived threat on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high). A SARS knowledge score (scale 0-2) was calculated based on whether the respondent could name a symptom of SARS and whether the respondent knew SARS was a communicable disease. Differences in background characteristics (gender, age group, area, and level of education) and risk perceptions between the samples in Europe and Asia were explored with chi-square tests or (paired) Student's t tests, of which the p value and the effect size r are reported.

Firstly, the response rate varied substantially between countries from 21.3% to 81.1% with low response rates in the participating Asian Fig. 1 Mean perceived threat of SARS and flu from a new flu virus in case of an outbreak, high blood pressure and diabetes by country. The asterisk indicates that the difference in mean perceived threat between SARS and flu is statistically significant countries in particular. This may have led to nonrepresentative samples, and the differences in response rates may partly explain the reported differences in risk perceptions and other variables. These differences in response rates and the low rates in some of the participating countries limit the generalizability of our data, and the results should, therefore, be interpreted with caution. Secondly, because of the lack of an existing validated questionnaire for perceived threat and risk perception of infectious diseases suitable for telephone administration in large samples, the questionnaire was specifically developed for the project reported in this paper based upon an earlier questionnaire used during the SARS outbreak [16] . Our study design, aiming to include a large number of respondents from a range of different countries and regions, using telephone surveying as the means of data collection, combined with the financial and time pressure restraints, enabled the inclusion of only a limited number of items per construct. This may have reduced the reliability of our measures, especially toward possible underlying cultural differences in constructs. Furthermore, extensive pretesting of the survey questionnaire with cognitive interviewing was restricted to two European countries. We, therefore, do not know whether all concepts used were understood in the same way in all participating countries. On the other hand, we did contextualize our risk perception questions by including a setting (in case of an outbreak), time frame (next 12 months), and focusing on the risk of the individual (instead of population)-all issues known to be important for measuring risk percep- The present study also has its strengths. It is among the first large-scale comparative studies into perceived threat and risk perception of emerging infectious diseases, and in fact, unique in the number of countries represented. Perceived threat for SARS, as well as avian influenza, were among the highest and at the same level as for, for example, a heart attack. This indicates that these potential problems were taken very seriously by the general public.",

For example, in 2003, risk perception of SARS in some of the Asian countries was relatively low compared to risk perception in the USA. Ji et al., in their study on optimism across cultures, have pointed out that unrealistic optimism concerning SARS was higher among Chinese than among Canadians [18] .

Also, efficacy beliefs related to a common cold and flu from a new virus were higher in Asian countries where the latter may be explained by the fact that, despite the first cases of avian influenza among humans in Asia already reported in 2003, this has not resulted in a larger outbreak [22] .",

This result is also in line with a lower risk perception of SARS among Finns compared to Dutch [24, 30] . One of the explanations for this tendency is that the media in Scandinavia appear to report more about risks abroad with less attention to risk inside the country [29] . However, we need to interpret the differences between countries with care because cognitive constructs such as risk perceptions are not necessarily interpreted in the same way in different cultures [31] . Indeed, the data of our study on comparison of risk perceptions for various diseases show that the relative risk perceptions for these diseases, i.e., the order of levels of risk perceptions, are rather consistent across countries. This may indicate that differences between countries in absolute risk perception levels for specific diseases or conditions may reflect cultural differences in the way survey questions are answered rather than real differences in risk perceptions. Voeten et al. [32] , in their study on risk perception and efficacy beliefs among Chinese communities in the UK and The Netherlands, have shown that efficacy beliefs of Chinese living in the UK and The Netherlands were comparable to those of native UK and Dutch respondents. This may indicate that country of residence, perhaps because of country-specific public health systems and media coverage, may be more important than ethnicity or country and culture of origin. Because country appears to be a relevant correlate of SARS-related risk perceptions in the multivariate analyses, further research is needed to explain these country differences.",

Such a situation is characterized by Table 6 Correlates of perceived threat for SARS; regression coefficients (B) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) derived from linear regression analyses less control, which is associated with less optimism [33, 34] . The notion that, for an outbreak, risks were perceived to be more evenly distributed, and thus they seemed to be less prone to an optimistic bias, may offer starting points for public interventions. Such interventions should certainly also focus on increasing self-efficacy, especially in the European countries, because low self-efficacy may lead to lack of protection motivation. Perceived threat of SARS and flu from a new flu virus in case of an outbreak was similar in most countries. However, the level of severity for SARS was higher than for flu from a new virus, while vulnerability for flu from a new virus was higher than for SARS in all countries. One explanation might be that SARS is a more unfamiliar disease for most people compared to flu. It indicates that people do perceive various aspects of risk perceptions differently for different emerging infectious diseases and that risk communication should thus be disease-and perception-specific.",
