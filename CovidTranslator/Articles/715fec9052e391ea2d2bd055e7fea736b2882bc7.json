Previous work from our laboratory has suggested that susceptibility of macrophages may be regulated by various lymphokines. Therefore, cells from cortisone-treated mice were combined in vitro with normally resistant Call macrophages and the susceptibility of these was tested. C3H mice were given 2.5 mg cortisone on day 0, and the spleens were removed 3 d later. 0.5 \u00d7 106 spleen cells were then added to each culture of normal C3H macrophages. Control macrophage cultures received equal numbers of untreated spleen cells from syngeneic mice. Various dilutions of virus [MHV(PRI)] were inoculated into both groups of cultures. All cultures were kept for 6 d at 37\u00b0C. The results are summarized in Table I . Genetically resistant macrophages were destroyed by day 3 at 100-fold greater dilutions when they were cocultivated with spleen cells from cortisone-treated spleen cells but not the normal spleen cells. Spleen cells that had been killed by heating to 56\u00b0C for 30 min or by freezing and thawing did not alter the resistance of Call macrophages.",

When the mice were given only one injection of HC, the macrophages were not susceptible. Viral growth was demonstrated primarily by cell destruction, which occurred as early as 2 d, but giant-cell formation also occurred which eventually ended in loss of contact with the culture tube. Virus yield was determined in critical cases. The 1,000-fold increase in susceptibility of the macrophages was routinely observed if three doses of HC ranging from 50 #g to 5 mg were given to the mice, but when 10 mg was used, the cells were only 10-fold more susceptible. Shif and Bang (3) demonstrated that when high multiplicities of MHV(PRI) were Each group of CsH mice (six per group) received three intraperitoneal doses (1 mg each) of the steroid after thioglycollate stimulation, and PEC were harvested 24 h after the last dose. * All macrophages in the experiment were seeded in 16-mm 24-well tissue culture cluster plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CC.~z and humidified air, given to C3H macrophages, a mutant virus, MHV(C3H), emerged that grew to high titer in both resistant and susceptible macrophages. Following the above findings, macrophage cultures from HC-treated mice receiving 104 LDs0 of MHV(PRI), and which were destroyed by the virus, were assayed for virus yield on CzH and C3Hss macrophages on days 5 and 7 postinfection. Virus harvested from macrophages of HC-treated mice on day 5 postinfection titered 10,000 times higher in CaHss macrophages than in CnH macrophages. By day 7 postinfection, the difference had decreased to 2 logs, presumably because of late growth of the mutant. Because of this, most of the subsequent experiments were limited to observations within 5 d of inoculation. The effect of cortisone is apparently glucoeorticoid-specific. Prednisolone and dexamethasone were administered in the same way as HC: three successive injections, intraperitoneally, in vivo. Two steroids (progesterone and testosterone) were similarly administered. The results showed that the active glucocorticoids increased susceptibility of the C3H macrophages, whereas the other steroids did not (Table III) .",

            "text": "Although it has been known almost from the start of research on cortisone that this powerful anti-inflammatory drug depresses various immunologic mechanisms (1), the way in which it alters susceptibility to specific agents is not clear. The correspondence between in vivo and in vitro susceptibility of macrophages to mouse hepatitis made this model an attractive one to study. Cortisone-induced increase in susceptibility of mice to mouse hepatitis virus has also been observed by a number of other investigators as summarized by Vella and Starr (8) . Administration of cortisone to the genetically resistant CzI-I mice (9) , as well as to outbred mice, rendered them susceptible to viral [MHV(PRI)] infection. The LDs0 of MHV(PRI) virus was 108.5 in PRI mice, 106.5 in cortisone-treated Call mice, and <101'\u00b0 in untreated Call mice (9) . The slight or equivocal change in macrophage resistance, which had been demonstrated in vitro (7, 9) , was in no way comparable to the marked effects on the intact animal. Gallily et al. (9) , using a 1:100 dilution of stock virus (106 LDs0), had found that 85-100% of TAYLOR ET AL. BRIEF DEFINITIVE REPORT cortisone-treated cultures were killed by virus as compared to -20% of cultures given virus alone. Willenborg (7), using a single dose of 2.5 mg cortisone, had found that the LDs0 of MHV(PRI) virus in macrophage cultures from cortisone-treated Call mice was 103.4 , and in cultures from untreated mice, it was 103.2 . In our studies, it was apparently crucial to administer three doses of HC to the mice to achieve sufficient suppression of viral resistance for in vitro expression of the effect. Presumably, a 1,000fold increase of susceptibility of macrophages may explain most, if not all, of the 105.5 difference in titer in normal and cortisone-treated mice.",

That Con A and cortisone act antagonistically in their studies (10) is very relevant to the similar blocking effect of one by the other in our system.
