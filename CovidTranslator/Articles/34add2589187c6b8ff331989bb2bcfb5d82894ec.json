Some members such as bovine coronavirus (BCV), human coronavirus (HCV-OC43), and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) are quite potent hemagglutinating agents. Studies with BCV have shown that the S-protein is the major hemagglutinin of these viruses recognizing N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac,) as a receptor determinant on cells (1). These coronaviruses possess another surface glycoprotein, HE, which is a less efficient hemagglutinin and functions as a receptor-destroying enzyme (I-4). It releases the acetyl group from position C-9 of Neu5,9Ac, similar to the HEF-protein of influenza C virus (3, 5, 6) . Several other coronaviruses, e.g., porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) lack a receptordestroying enzyme and their ability to agglutinate red blood cells is very poor (7-9). The receptor determinant recognized by this group of viruses has not previously been identified.",

However, this effect was observed only when a crude enzyme preparation was used. Therefore, the induction of the hemagglutinating activity of IBV may have been due to a contaminating enzyme rather than to phospholipase C. As we were unable to unmask the hemagglutinating activity of IBV by treatment of virus ' To whom reprint requests should be addressed with commercially available phospholipase C, we analyzed whether neuraminidase was effective in this respect. As shown in Table 1 , while untreated virus was unable to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes, high hemagglutination titers were obtained after treatment of virions with neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae. The same effect was observed after incubation with the purified HN protein from Newcastle disease virus, which also has neuraminidase activity. This enzyme preferentially cleaves sialic acid in an (~2,3 linkage to galactose, but is rather inefficient in releasing sialic acid from an (r2,6 linkage (lo). This result indicated that removal of a2,3-linked sialic acid from the viral surface was required for IBV to agglutinate red blood cells.",

In this case the receptor determinant on the virion surface would compete with the receptor determinant on the cell surface for the receptor-binding site of the virus. As a consequence, the efficiency of the binding to erythrocytes would be reduced and explain the lack of hemagglutinating activity. This model implies that IBV uses a2,3-linked sialic acid as a receptor determinant for attachment to cells. To test this possibility, erythrocytes were treated with neuraminidase and analyzed for agglutination by neuraminidase-treated IBV. As shown in Table 2 and CMP-Neu5Ac. Following attachment of sialic acid to the surface of erythrocytes in an c~2,3 linkage, the ceils were agglutinated by both NDV and IBV (Table 3 ). The former virus is known to recognize cu2,3-linked sialic acid as a receptor determinant for attachment to cells (1 I). Our results indicated that IBV had the same requirements for agglutination of erythrocytes as NDV.",

The first possibility can be excluded because there is no indication by electron microscopic analysis or by gradient centrifugation that coronaviruses without receptor-destroying enzyme have a greater tendency to form aggregates than do coronaviruses with receptor-destroying enzyme. We were also unable to detect any difference in this respect between untreated and neuraminidase-treated IBV (not shown). Future work has to show whether the inhibition is due to the interaction between viral components of the same virus particle or due to the interaction between the viral binding protein and a cellular component containing sialic acid.",

            "text": "Our findings raise the question about the importance of a viral binding activity that is masked by the receptor determinant present on the virion surface. The lack of hemagglutinating activity does not imply that IBV is unable to attach to the receptors on erythrocytes. Conditions for the agglutination of cells by a virus, (i.e., the bridging of many erythrocytes) are more stringent than those for the attachment of a single virion to the surface of a single cell. Thus, despite the lack of hemagglutinating activity, untreated IBV might be able to use the sialic acid-binding activity for attachment to cells and for initiation of an infection. Alternatively, the sialic acid-binding activity may mediate a primary attachment, facilitating the interaction with a second type of receptor which might be necessary for a closer contact between virus and cell and/or for fusion between viral and cellular membranes. The latter possibility is especially intriguing, because it combines two receptor-recognition strategies that have been reported for the MHV-BCV serogroup of coronaviruses. In the case of BCV, 9-0-acetylated sialic acid has been shown to function as a receptor determinant for the initiation of infection (12). For strain A59 of MHV, a murine member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family of glycoproteins has been identified as a receptor (13, 14) . It should be noted that the sialic acid binding activity of IBV has been analyzed so far only with erythrocytes. Future work with cultured cells will be necessary to determine whether sialic acid is involved in the initiation of infection. These studies will be performed with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), another coronavirus lacking a receptor-destroying enzyme. Like IBV, TGEV is a poor hemagglutinin and from our preliminary experiments we expect that both viruses have the same agglutination characteristics. However, TGEV grows more readily in cell culture than IBV and, therefore, is more suitable for analyzing the role of sialic acid in virus infection.",

The former group of viruses are known to utilize 9-0-acetylated sialic acid present on the surface of erythrocytes for the agglutination of cells (3, 6). Our results obtained with IBV demonstrate that a coronavirus, which lacks a receptor-destroying enzyme, can also recognize sialic acid though of a different subtype (Neu5Ac versus Neu5,9Ac,). Now we have the unique situation that viruses of the same family recognize a common sugar as receptor determinant for attachment to cells, but only some members of the family contain a receptor-destroying enzyme. Thus, either some coronaviruses have acquired the corresponding gene or the others have lost it during evolution. It has been speculated that coronaviruses such as BCV have acquired the esterase gene by a nonhomologous recombination between an ancestral coronavirus and influenza C virus (15). Certainly the family Coronaviridae is a promising model for evolutionary studies of the acquisition or loss of a receptor-destroying enzyme by viruses.",
