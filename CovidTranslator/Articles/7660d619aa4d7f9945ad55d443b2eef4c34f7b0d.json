            "text": "Objective: We sought to determine the effect of Ptx3 deletion on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic inflammation in a murine model of asthma. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected from patients with severe asthma and healthy subjects, and the level of PTX3 was determined by using ELISA. Ptx3 1/1 and Ptx3 2/2 mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and the lungs were collected for assessing inflammation. Lung tissue inflammation and mucus production were assessed by means of flow cytometry and hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff staining, respectively. flexiVent was used to determine airway resistance to methacholine in these mice. Results: Here we report that mice with severe asthma and OVA-sensitized/challenged mice had increased PTX3 levels in the lungs compared with healthy control mice. Mice lacking PTX3 have exaggerated neutrophilic/eosinophilic lung inflammation, mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness in an experimental model of OVA-induced asthma. Furthermore, OVA-exposed lung Ptx3 2/2 CD4 T cells exhibit an increased production of IL-17A, an effect that is accompanied by an increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation, reduced IL-2 production, and enhanced activation and survival. Also, we observed an increase in numbers of IL-6-and IL-23-producing dendritic cells in OVA-exposed Ptx3 2/2 mice compared with those in wild-type control mice. Conclusion: Altogether, PTX3 deficiency results in augmented airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus production, and IL-17Adominant pulmonary inflammation, suggesting a regulatory role of PTX3 in the development of allergic inflammation.

            "text": "Asthma is classically defined as a disease orchestrated by the adaptive immune system. However, recent advances suggest considerable crosstalk between the innate and adaptive immune systems in initiation and propagation of allergic immune response. 5 Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors, are key components of the innate immune system that have been found to play an important role in allergic inflammation. PRRs on epithelial cells and dendritic cells (DCs) recognize pathogenassociated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns and act as adjuvants in directing allergen sensitization. [6] [7] [8] Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a prototypic soluble PRR involved in the regulation of inflammation through multiple mechanisms that include interaction with components of complement pathways, Fcg receptors, pathogenic moieties on microbes, and regulation of leukocyte migration. 9 Previously, lack of PTX3 has been reported to exaggerate inflammation in the setting of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, aspergillosis, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice. The protective role of exogenous PTX3 in aspergillosis, pneumonia, and tuberculosis further strengthens the preceding observations (reviewed by Balhara et al 9 ) . Collectively, these studies demonstrate that infection and lung injury increase PTX3 production in the lung. 9 Previously published data by our group 10 showed enhanced PTX3 expression in the lungs of patients with severe allergic asthma compared with that in healthy donors. Structural cells, particularly epithelial and airway smooth muscle cells, were the main producers of PTX3 in vivo and on proinflammatory cytokine stimulation in vitro. However, the role of PTX3 in the development of allergic asthma remains unknown.",

We first determined influx of inflammatory cells in the airway lumen. There was a significant infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airways of Ptx3 1/1 and Ptx3 2/2 mice after OVA challenge; however, Ptx3 2/2 mice exhibited Table IV ). Although both genotypes showed an eosinophil-dominant response on OVA challenge, Ptx3 2/2 mice exhibited greater BALF eosinophil counts (Fig 2, B , and Table  IV ) and lung tissue eosinophilia (Siglec F high /Gr-1 low/2 ; Fig 2, E and F) compared with their Ptx3 1/1 counterparts. Greater neutrophil counts in the airways and lungs (CD11b 1 /Gr-1 1 ) were also detected in Ptx3 2/2 mice compared with their Ptx3 1/ 1 counterparts (Fig 2, B , G, and H, respectively). 12 Enhanced infiltration of inflammatory cells surrounding the airways and blood vessels in Ptx3 2/2 mice compared with Ptx3 1/1 mice was further supported by an examination of H&E-stained lung sections (Fig 2, I) .",

OVA challenge resulted in amplified AHR, as determined by measuring airway resistance to inhaled MCh in Ptx3 2/2 mice (n 5 12; P < .01; Fig 4, A) compared with Ptx3 1/1 mice. We also observed evidence of enhanced goblet cell hyperplasia, as determined by using PAS staining (Fig 4, B and C) , and expression of muc5ac (Fig 4, D) and muc5b (Fig 4, E) in Ptx3 2/2 mice in contrast to Ptx3 1/1 mice. These results collectively indicate that PTX3 deletion aggravates OVA-induced AHR and mucus production. Evaluation of cytokine production in the lungs and MLNs is an essential parameter used to assess allergic inflammation. 15, 16 Therefore we next explored the levels of IL-4, IFN-g, and IL-17A in lung homogenates and MLNs. OVA exposure induced T H 2 response, as determined by IL-4 (Fig 5, A) and IL-5 (see Fig  E1, D, in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) levels in the lungs of both strains of mice compared with their saline-exposed counterparts. Absolute concentrations of IL-4 (Ptx3 2/2 : 25.1 6 2.5 pg/mL vs Ptx3 1/1 : 52.9 6 3.9 pg/mL) and IL-5 (Ptx3 2/2 : 122.8 6 47 pg/mL vs Ptx3 1/1 : 211 6 13.9 pg/mL) were lesser in Ptx3 2/2 mice compared with those in Ptx3 1/1 mice on OVA challenge. However, the magnitude of IL-4 but not IL-5 induction as compared with their respective saline controls (data not shown) was greater in Ptx3 2/2 mice on OVA challenge in comparison with that seen in their Ptx3 1/1 littermates (see Fig E1, A, which shows a fold change in the concentration of IL-4 on OVA exposure in Ptx3 1/1 and Ptx3 2/2 mice).",

A key conclusion that has emerged from these findings is that PTX3 provides protection against specific infections, including SARS, P aeruginosa, CMV, pneumonia, and aspergillosis. 9 The role of PTX3 has not been previously studied in the mucosal adaptive immune response, particularly in asthmatic patients. In this report we revealed an association between PTX3 and allergic inflammation, as observed in asthmatic patients. Consistent with our BALF data from patients with severe allergic asthma, the lungs of allergen-exposed mice displayed a highly significant increase in the level of PTX3 compared with those of salinetreated control mice. These findings are in agreement with our previously reported data in bronchial biopsy specimens obtained from patients with severe asthma. 10 For the first time, we demonstrate that features of allergic asthma, such as AHR, airway remodeling, and inflammation, were heightened in the absence of PTX3 in a murine model of OVA-induced experimental asthma. Moreover, absence of PTX3 promotes a T H 17-dominant CD4 T-cell response in the lungs combined with enhanced survival of CD4 T cells, suggesting a critical function of PTX3 in preferential maintenance of the specific CD4 T-cell population, at least in OVA-induced inflammation. Enhanced production of IL-6 and IL-23 by DCs from mice deficient in PTX3, a T H 17-inducing proinflammatory cytokine, provides a mechanistic explanation accounting for an IL-17A-dominant allergic inflammation in these mice. Collectively, our data suggest a hitherto unrecognized function of PTX3 in regulation of events involved in the pathogenesis of asthma-associated allergic inflammation.",

It is likely that a unique phenotype of CD4 T cells from Ptx3 2/2 mice, as observed in inflammation, can result from alteration of other cell types. DCs constitute major antigen (allergen)-presenting cells to T cells in allergic inflammation. Besides presenting allergen epitopes and providing costimulatory signals, they regulate the phenotype and functions of CD4 T cells through cytokine production. DCs produce IL-6 and IL-23, through which these cells dictate differentiation of naive CD4 T cells to T H 17 CD4 T cells through activation of STAT3-dependent pathway. 25, 58 Increased numbers of IL-6-and IL-23-producing DCs in the lungs of Ptx3 2/2 mice on OVA exposure explain the enhanced differentiation of T H 17 cells in OVA-exposed Ptx3 2/2 mice compared with that seen in wild-type control mice. Altogether, our data suggest contribution of DCs from Ptx3 2/2 mice through increased IL-6 production, resulting in IL-17A-prominent inflammation. However, we do not deny role of other IL-6-and IL-23-producing structural and inflammatory cells, including epithelial cells and macrophages, respectively. Whether they also regulate IL-17A-dominant inflammation in Ptx3 2/2 mice will be interesting to study in succeeding studies.",

Whether the h2/h2 SNP has an effect on allergen-induced inflammation is worth questioning.",

Without dismissing the role of PTX3 in regulating innate inflammatory mechanisms, our study proposes that the absence of PTX3 results in dysregulated programming of CD4 T cells, leading to an exaggerated allergen-induced inflammation. The IL-17A-dominant immune response has previously been associated with steroid-resistant severe asthma in human subjects. 60 Therefore our study might provide some novel insight into understanding the mechanisms involved in regulation of the IL-17A-dominant immune response in patients with severe asthma. Based on our current data, it is difficult to infer whether PTX3 treatment would provide protection against unwarranted allergen-induced activation of immune system. However, our data clearly show that deletion of PTX3 plays a critical role in regulating functional capacity of immune system, thereby affecting immunologic metrics in response to an allergen in a murine model of experimental asthma.",

Mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally (pentobarbital, 0.1 mL per 10 g of body weight). After establishing anesthesia, midcervical tracheotomy was performed by inserting a polyethylene catheter (1 .1 3 25 mm) , which was kept in place by ligating with surgical silk thread. The catheter was connected to the small-animal ventilator, and positive end-expiratory pressure was maintained at 3 cm H 2 O. Mice were subjected to serial aerosol MCh challenge (30 mL, 3-50 mg $ mL 21 MCh in saline), and baseline mechanics were determined by using saline-only challenge. Before each challenge with saline or MCh, lung loading history was normalized by means of inflation to total lung capacity. Respiratory mechanics were assessed by using a preset flexiVent Prime-8 low-frequency forced oscillation protocol to derive respiratory mechanical input impedance. Airway resistance was derived by fitting respiratory mechanical input impedance to the constant-phase model.",

Lung homogenates from Ptx3 2/2 mice, on the other hand, showed a significant increase in concentrations of both cytokines on OVA exposure compared with those seen in their saline-exposed counterparts (IFN-g OVA: 377.0 6 38.6 pg/mL vs saline: not detected; IL-17A OVA: 176.8 6 1.8 pg/mL vs saline: 35.6 6 1.6 pg/mL; Fig 5, B and C, and see Fig E1, B and C).Concomitantly, an increase in IL-12 and IL-6 induction was also observed in Ptx3 2/2 mice on OVA exposure (seeFig E1,E and F, respectively).Recall response in MLNs also demonstrated induction of IL-4, IFN-g, and IL-17A responses in both strains. However, Ptx3 2/2 mice exhibited an IL-17A-prevalent response compared with their Ptx3 1/1 littermates (Ptx3 2/2 : 2367 6 184.2 pg/mL vs Ptx3 1/1 : 966.7 6 68.9 pg/mL;Fig 5, F).

IL-4(Fig 5, D)production was lower in Ptx3 2/2 mice compared with their Ptx3 1/1 littermates (Ptx3 2/2 : 50 6 11.5 pg/mL vs Ptx3 1/1 : 78621.3 pg/mL).",
