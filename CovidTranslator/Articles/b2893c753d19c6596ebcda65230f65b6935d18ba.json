Data sources include search engine and social media queries (9, 10) , crowd-sourced event-based information queries (11) , machine learning (12) , natural language processing, and geolocalization (13) . In 2014, DDD identified the resurgence of poliomyelitis and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa before the World Health Organization (WHO) officially reported them (14) , 2 events WHO later declared as Public Health Events of International Concern. As DDD data quality and accuracy improve, DDD will likely assume a more prominent role, particularly in settings where the infrastructure to support public health surveillance systems is lacking (10) . However, DDD needs more systematic integration into the formal, governmentowned surveillance landscape as well as ties to response mechanisms to maximize its potential (10, 15) . The systematic use of nongovernment, informal surveillance systems is beginning to gain traction with surveillance systems such as WHO's new Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources, an event-based system receiving alerts from a range of informal sources, planned for launch in the near future (16) . DDD data raise new ethical and legal challenges that need to be addressed as they become integrated into conventional surveillance systems (17) . These data also create competition for resources or the generation of data that are not consistent with data from conventional surveillance systems; these factors can give rise to trust and acceptability issues. Nevertheless, evidence for the added value of these data is building, and they are increasingly being incorporated into conventional surveillance systems.",

This sharing can also reduce the potential or actual impact of a global health crisis. For example, the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, a laboratory network that shares information to detect the emergence of novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential (21) , helped prevent SARS from becoming endemic after the 2003 outbreak (22) . This network also improved the timeliness of the response to the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic (21) . Besides being useful for outbreak management, sharing of routine public health surveillance data enables national and international collaboration, capacity strengthening, insight into public health system performance, and ultimately better control of infectious diseases (18).",

China's delay in sharing information about the 2003 SARS outbreak contributed to the disease's spread and the delayed global response (24) as well as economic and reputation damage to China (25) . With Middle East respiratory syndrome, the incomplete assessment of the disease origin and source has largely been attributed to a reluctance to share public health surveillance data in a timely fashion (26) . Sharing of data helps achieve appropriate public health action while limiting risks to travel and trade. IHR 2005 is designed to ensure maximum public health benefit while keeping restrictions to a minimum (5) . Nevertheless, public health surveillance data are not always freely shared because of perceived or real technical, political, economic, motivational, ethical, and legal barriers (27) .

These organizations provide standards and advice on data sharing to facilitate the process by individual countries and conduct their own surveillance activities (28) ; examples include the WHO's global measles surveillance system (4) and the European Union's surveillance system (TESSy), which has standardized surveillance across the European Union (29) . Such supranational systems come with their own challenges, such as the additional burden placed on individual countries to report data already analyzed nationally and the difficulties associated with comparing different types of data resulting from surveillance systems with different national legal bases.

Two principal dimensions to trust are brought to bear when public health surveillance data are 1326 Emerging Infectious Diseases \u2022 www.cdc.gov/eid \u2022 Vol. 24, No. 7, July 2018 shared. First, organizations sharing public health surveillance data should do so in a transparent manner and should be able to demonstrate to communities from which the data originate how their data are collected, analyzed, used, and protected. Second, trust-building measures between organizations or individuals sharing data, whether at the personal or organizational level, help create an environment where public health surveillance data can be shared. Transparency with regard to what data are shared with whom, and for what purpose, is a prerequisite. Trust includes ensuring that the shared data are used responsibly and not made available to other parties or publicly without consulting the data providers. When the purpose of sharing data is clear and explicit, and those persons involved in sharing know each other, understand each other's expectations, and carry out commitments as agreed, a trust relationship can emerge. Established trust increases the likelihood of collaboration and shared benefits and promotes core surveillance capacity through the creation of surveillance networks (19) . Building trust for routine data sharing can provide strong foundations for emergency surveillance and response. Building trust can be hard, but losing trust is all too easy. In practice, trust often translates into developing appropriate professional relationships with counterparts in other countries or regions (35) . Trust-building measures sometimes take the form of face-to-face meetings, regional workshops, desktop exercises, or joint outbreak investigations (19) . For data recipients, providers must be trustworthy in providing high-quality data. Therefore, improving data quality through capacity-building (for example, by sharing technical expertise) is in their interest.",
