Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN1, encoded by CD209), an attachment receptor of dengue virus, is essential for productive infection of dendritic cells 1, 2 . Here, we report strong association between a promoter variant of CD209, DCSIGN1-336, and risk of dengue fever compared with dengue hemorrhagic fever or population controls. The G allele of the variant DCSIGN1-336 was associated with strong protection against dengue fever in three independent cohorts from Thailand, with a carrier frequency of 4.7% in individuals with dengue fever compared with 22.4% in individuals with dengue hemorrhagic fever (odds ratio for risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever versus dengue fever: 5.84, P 5 1.4 3 10 27 ) and 19 .5% in controls (odds ratio for protection: 4.90, P 5 2 3 10 26 ). This variant affects an Sp1-like binding site and transcriptional activity in vitro. These results indicate that CD209 has a crucial role in dengue pathogenesis, which discriminates between severe dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. This may have consequences for therapeutic and preventive strategies.",

The study was restricted to hospitalized schoolage children. For dengue fever, we restricted our study to the most symptomatic individuals with dengue fever (classical incapacitating dengue fever) 3 , excluding those whose only clinical manifestation was fever.

Therefore, it is unlikely that this effect is related to variants in these two flanking genes. Overall, these results support the idea that DCSIGN1-336 is responsible for the observed association with severity of dengue disease. DCSIGN1-336 is located in the promoter region of CD209, 212 bp 5\u00a2 of the major transcription start site 7 . This site affects multiple predicted transcription factor binding sites for Sp1/GATA1/CACCCand CAC-binding transcription factors, of the type GGGTGGG, with allele G (underlined) associated with the presence of binding sites, and allele A with its absence. This sequence was conserved in the homologous gene CD209L, with a G at the corresponding position 7 . We carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) by incubating HeLa nuclear extracts with two alternative 22-nucleotide probes differing at the DCSIGN1-336 position (Fig. 2a,b) . The G variant showed increased Sp1 binding capacity compared with the A variant, which was effectively competed by the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide. This suggests that the DCSIGN1-336 variant affects the binding of Sp1 and possibly other transcription factors that modulate transcriptional activity, supporting the idea that is has a functional role in the transcriptional regulation of CD209.

These findings bring new insight to the classical view of a continuum of disease severity between dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever 12 . The expected decrease in expression of CD209 carrying the G allele at DCSIGN1-336 may result in a lower susceptibility of dendritic cells to dengue virus in the early stages of infection 1,2 , which would protect against dengue fever, whereas other pathophysiological processes would be prevalent in dengue hemorrhagic fever. It is notable that major disturbances of immune responses are observed in dengue hemorrhagic fever compared with dengue fever 13 .",

First, there may be differential interaction between dengue virus and CD209, depending on the genetic variability of the dengue virus strain, which affects both the level of infectivity of CD209-expressing dendritic cells 2 and the viral virulence 14 . Second, in dengue hemorrhagic fever, there may be an alternative pathway to the CD209-mediated dengue virus entry to dendritic cells. The high viral load observed in dengue hemorrhagic fever may be caused by the antibody-enhanced dengue virus infection of monocytes through Fcg receptors in individuals with pre-existing dengue virus antibodies (antibody-dependant enhancement). Previous studies have reported some association of polymorphisms in HLA class I, TNFa and Fcg receptor IIA genes with dengue hemorrhagic fever [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Notably, some HLA alleles were specifically associated with the risk of dengue fever rather than dengue hemorrhagic fever 18 . Overall, the risk of infection and disease severity probably results from complex interactions between CD209 variability and other host and viral factors, whose elucidation requires further detailed investigations.",

In addition to its role in infection by arboviruses such as dengue virus 21, 22 , CD209 is an attachment factor for many other pathogens: viruses with glycosylated envelope proteins, including human immunodeficiency virus-1, hepatitis C virus, cytomegalovirus, Ebola virus and SARS-coV; bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis; and parasites such as Leishmania and Schistosoma mansoni [22] [23] [24] [25] .

Diagnosis was established by expert clinicians in each center, following World Health Organization criteria as follows. Individuals suspected to have dengue viral infection on the basis of clinical features including high fever, severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthalgia, nausea and vomiting, and rash were admitted to the hospitals for clinical observation and treatment. The diagnosis of dengue virus infection was later confirmed by a comparable dengue-specific IgG and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer on a late acute or convalescent sera 27 . Differential diagnosis of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever was established on the basis of the absence (dengue fever) or presence (dengue hemorrhagic fever) of evidence for increased vascular permeability manifested by hemoconcentration or pleural effusion. Specifically, the diagnosis of dengue hemorrhagic fever was made on the basis of the four following characteristics: (i) high continuous fever lasting 2-7 d, (ii) hemorrhagic tendency such as a positive tourniquet test, petechii, purpura or hematemesis, (iii) thrombocytopenia (platelet count Z100,000 ml \u00c01 and (iv) evidence of plasma leakage due to increased vascular permeability manifested by hemoconcentration (an increased in hematocrit of 20% or more) or pleural effusion. The severity of dengue hemorrhagic fever was categorized in four grades according to World Health Organization criteria 3 . Grades III and IV were dengue hemorrhagic fever with narrowing pulse pressure with a characteristically elevated diastolic pressure to profound shock. In the three cohorts, clinical and biological data were recorded during their hospitalization and stored into a database.",

At Ramathibodi Hospital, affected individuals were requested to come back to the hospital 2-3 weeks after discharge, and a follow-up hematocrit and platelet measure was done, allowing for better evaluation of increase in hematocrit during previous admission. At Khon-Kaen Hospital, clinical and biological recording was more systematic and was computerized from the start of the study, and this detailed information was used to complement the dengue status established by clinicians. In cohort KK, hematocrit measurements were done at least four times a day, and up to every hour during the critical period of defeverescence.

Similarly, we identified polymorphisms in CLEC4M and CLEC4G in 48 individuals with dengue and 32 controls using primers shown in Supplementary Table 5 online.

We also carried out a direct investigation of a repeated region in exon 4 (ref. 29) in 96 cases and 96 controls, which extended the identification of DCSIGN1.ex4RPT and DCSIGN1.ex4SF polymorphisms. Only three rare variants (o2%) affected the coding regions of the protein: two amino acid substitutions and one variation in the number of repeats of a 23-amino-acid unit located in the predicted extracellular domain 29 (Supplementary Table 2 online). The other polymorphisms were located in introns (8), in the promoter or 5\u00a2 region of the gene (6), in the 3\u00a2 untranslated region (21) or 3\u00a2 to the gene (2) . Sixteen of these polymorphisms were located in repeat sequences. Twentyseven of these polymorphisms had a rare allele frequency 40.02. We genotyped DCSIGN1-336, DCSIGN1-139, DCSIGN1.in2+11, DCSIGN1.ex4SF and DCSIGN1.2281 using PCR-RFLP assays and DCSIGN1.ex4RPT by PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis (Supplementary Table 6 Table  7 online) using ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System, with recommended protocols.

We tested deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in individuals with dengue disease and in controls, in each cohort and overall, and found that it was not statistically significant for any SNP.

Competition with unlabeled Sp1 consensus probe showed a threefold decrease in binding to the -336G probe, but no significant decrease in binding to the -336A probe.
