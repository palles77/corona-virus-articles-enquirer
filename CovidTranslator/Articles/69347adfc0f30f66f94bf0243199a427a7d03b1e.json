            "text": "How do stressful events and negative emotions influence the immune system, and how big are the effects? This broad question has been intensely interesting to psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) researchers over the last three decades, and the consequent discoveries have substantially changed the face of health psychology. We have learned that distress can slow wound healing, diminish the strength of immune responses to vaccines, enhance susceptibility to infectious agents, and reactivate latent viruses (Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005) . Moreover, stress and depression can also substantially augment the production of proinflammatory cytokines that are associated with a spectrum of age-related diseases (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2003) . Indeed, it is precisely because PNI researchers' efforts have been so fruitful that we can now glimpse just how exciting and far reaching the answers can be. In this article, I briefly describe several promising lines of work that underscore the reasons why this question is still so important and pivotal to understanding and other advances. I also suggest that new multidisciplinary permutations will provide fresh vistas in the field. Finally, I argue that we need to train our students more broadly to assure that they-and our discipline-will be not only competitive, but essential players in the advancement of biomedical science.",

Moreover, the mean annual changes in IL-6 among former caregivers did not differ from that of current caregivers, even several years after the death of the impaired spouse, suggesting that chronic stress might prematurely age the immune response. Recent data suggest that stress and depression can influence cytokine secretion by tumor cells that influence the tumor microenvironment via neuroendocrine pathways (Antoni et al., 2006) . These stress-related changes in inflammation provide evidence of one mechanism through which stressors may accelerate risk of a host of age-related diseases.",

However, viewed from another perspective, the evidence that vulnerabilities are not merely additive provides a window for considering new multidisciplinary prospects. For example, consider the possible intersections of stress/depression, diet, and immune function. Arachidonic-acid-derived (omega-6 or n-6) eicosanoids (primarily from refined vegetable oils such as corn, sunflower, and safflower) increase the production of proinflammatory cytokines (van West & Maes, 2003) . In contrast, the omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish, fish oil, walnuts, wheat germ, and some dietary supplements such as flax seed products can curb the production of arachidonic-acid-derived eicosanoids (Pischon et al., 2003) . Thus, higher n-6:n-3 ratios promote proinflammatory cytokine production (Pischon et al., 2003) . It is important to note that individuals with high n-6:n-3 ratios may also produce greater increases in proinflammatory cytokine production during stressful times (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2007; Maes, Christophe, Bosmans, Lin, & Neels, 2000) . Furthermore, higher levels of syndromal depression and depressive symptoms are associated with higher n-6:n-3 ratios, and n-3 supplementation may have positive effects on mood and inflammation (Hibbeln, Nieminen, Blasbalg, Riggs, & Lands, 2006; Maes et al., 2000) . Clearly, these key dietary pathways have implications for both psychological and immunological responses, as well as their interaction.",
