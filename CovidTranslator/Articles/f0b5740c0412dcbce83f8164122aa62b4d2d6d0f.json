Keywords Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a newly identified infectious disease[l-5 1 . The global outbreak of SARS has been threatening the health of people worldwide and has killed 353 people and infected more than 5462 in 27 countries, as reported by WHO on April 29, 2003 (http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/en).Although it has been recognized that a variant of virus from the family of coronavirus might be the candidate pathogen of SARS[I-5 1 , its identity as the unique pathogen still remains controversial (http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/ 24/science/24INFN.html; http://www.sciencenews.org/ 20030329/fob7.asp).",

The genome landscape of the virus that we sequenced (Isolate BJO 1) has the representative characteristics of a linear and positive single-stranded RNA molecule, flanked by a 5' -methylated cap and a 3 '-poly(At tail. It has a GC content of 40.8% (A : U : C : G = 28.5 : 30.7 : 20.0 : 20.8) with a relatively even distribution over the entire genome (Fig. 1) . However, two obvious GC-rich regions were observed at the nucleotide position 200-500 and 28200-28767 near the two termini, corresponding to the ORFs for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (orf la) and the N (nucleocapsid) protein partially overlapped with PUP5. Several repetitive sequences, which could be related to the secondary structure of a single-stranded RNA molecule, were observed. The 5' terminal sequence was predicted to have a typical secondary structure formed by a long repeat, i.e. the region (nt position 155-211) is highly homologous to the complementary sequence of a 60 nt one at the nucleotide position 861-920 ( Fig. 2) . At least 4 reversed repeates, with a minimal number of 7 nt in a subunit, were identified (Fig. 3) .

Eleven ORFs (6 CDSs and 5 PUPs) were predicted with a total length of 28550 bp, accounted for approximately 96% of the whole genome (Table 1 and Fig. 4 ). In addition to orf lab, overlapped ORFs were found between PUPI and PUP2, as well as between PUP2 and the E protein. The PUP5 (nt position 28111-28407) is embeded in the CDS for the N protein (nt position 28101-29369). Aside from 5' (245 nt) and 3' (355 nt) UTRs, there are only 6 intergenic regions with a total length of 560 nt, with 5 very small ones (6-50 nt) and one large one (478 nt, between PUP4 and the N protein). The available data are insufficient to confirm the reliability and possible function of PUPs identified by computation means. The observed order of CDSs is exactly the same as in other known HE(-) coronaviruses. Codon usage statistics showed that Leu (leusine) had the highest frequency ( Table 2) . The CDS for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (orf lab) is accounted for approximately 2/3 of the genome (nt position 246 -21466). It is composed of 2 ORFs (orf la and orf Ib, nt position 246 -13379 and 13379-21466), overlapped by a single nucleotide at the nucleotide position 13379.

In addition to the 5 I stable region of the RNA polymerase, no significant homology in the CDS or PUPs was detected between the SARS-associated virus and all the other genomes sequenced so far. 3 Discussion ( i ) Classification of the SARS-associated virus. A number of hypotheses were postulated regarding to the pathogen(s) of SARS before the SARS-associated coronavirus was recognized. Neither clinical symptoms of 946 phlegm nor increasing leukocytes, nor a curative effect of empirical anti-microbial treatment for SARS, have been the chief forms of evidence cited for excluding bacteria, as well as chlamydia and mycoplasma, as candidate pathogens [3] . The rapid spreading of the disease through respiratory tracts might suggest its possible viral etiology. An RNA virus was considered a likely candidate on the basis of the wide spectrum of atypical symptoms. The atypical clinical features might be related to the replication errors in the RNA viruses, which are significantly higher than that in DNA viruses. Based on this hypothesis, we focused on RNA viruses while still paying attention to other possible pathogen(s).",

More molecular epidemiological data, based on sequences of multiple isolates identified from different regions together with detailed clinical data, are essential to elucidating the route of global spreading and mutation during transmission. gil30027617 / us Urbani (Table 3) , the substitution rate is actually the lowest among the CDSs for the viral proteins with respect to its large size. A major contribution by studying the RNA polymerase is to understand the molecular mechanism of its low fidelity similar to other viral RNA polymerases, even though no direct correlation could be predicted to the viral antigenicity that is the most important to host immune response. More importantly, the RNA polymerase is well known to support the viral transcription independent of its host cells [9] . It could become the target of choice for future drug design or screening to inhibit the replication of the SARS-associated virus by exploiting its unique presence in the RNA viruses, coupled with the fact that the inhibition of RNA-dependent RNA replication should not affect any normal functions in human cells. Treatment of AIDS with \"cocktail\" is an illustrative example [IO] .",
