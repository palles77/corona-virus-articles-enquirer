We now show Msi1 expression in a subset of oligodendrocyte progenitor (OP) cells in white matter areas temporally and spatially associated with oligodendrogenesis in the postnatal CNS. Msi1 function was evaluated by infection of OP cells with retroviral transduction of Msi1 or knockdown of endogenous Msi1. Retroviral expression of Msi1 significantly reduced the proportion of mature oligodendrocytes generated from OP cells in vitro and in vivo during myelination. Msi1 transduction also promoted OP survival, particularly under conditions of challenge from oxidative stress, while Msi1 siRNA knockdown resulted in dramatic OP cell death. Furthermore, in experimental demyelination Msi1 expression was increased among cells associated with lesions, including OP cells, indicating a potential role in the generation of remyelinating oligodendrocytes.",

The Elav family, which includes the vertebrate Hu proteins, appears to function in the survival and differentiation of neurons (Akamatsu et al., 1999; Okano and Darnell, 1997) . The quaking family of RNA-binding proteins has primarily been identified in glial progenitors and oligodendrocytes; expression of several alternatively spliced isoforms coincides with the development of oligodendrocytes and the onset of myelination (Ebersole et al., 1996; Hardy, 1998; Lu et al., 2003) . The Musashi (Msi) family is preferentially expressed in CNS stem cells and appears to maintain these cells in an undifferentiated state (Kaneko et al., 2000; Okano et al., 2005; Sakakibara et al., 1996) , although differential expression of Msi1 may regulate cell fate decisions in the postnatal brain. In neonatal mice, multipotent cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and cells of the astrocyte lineage express Msi1, but postmitotic neurons and mature oligodendrocytes do not express Msi1 (Sakakibara et al., 1996; Sakakibara and Okano, 1997) , suggesting that differentiation along neuronal and oligodendrocyte lineages may require Msi1 downregulation.",

Olig2 is present in nuclei at all stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage and in a small subset of progenitor cells in the postnatal SVZ (Ligon et al., 2006; Menn et al., 2006) . Immunostaining for Msi1 and Olig2 showed a high density of Msi1+ cells in SVZ, with a subset of Msi1+ cells also immunoreactive for Olig2 (Fig. 1D ). Similar populations were observed in the subcallosal zone (SCZ), an extensive paraventricular region located between the hippocampus and CC that gives rise to oligodendrocytes postnatally (Seri et al., 2006) (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). The CC also contained Msi1+ Olig2+ cells (Figs. 1D-E). The Msi1+ Olig2+ cells in the CC adjacent to the SVZ or SCZ were often small, round cell bodies with rudimentary processes (Fig. 1D) , similar to the cells within the SVZ. The Msi1+ Olig2+ doublelabeled cells found elsewhere in the CC usually had elongated cell bodies with processes ( Fig.  1E) , although some small, round Msi1+ Olig2+ cells were also detected and usually appeared in pairs suggesting recent cell division (Fig. 1E , inset). In addition to these morphological indications that Msi1+ cells reflected an immature cell stage among the Olig2+ population, the preferential localization of Msi1+ Olig2+ cells near germinal zones supported this interpretation. The density of Msi1+ Olig2+ double-labeled cells was significantly higher in the regions of the CC near the SVZ (lateral CC, under the peaks of the cingulum; 134.30 \u00b1 17.64 cells/mm 2 ) than CC regions away from the SVZ (medial CC; 50.57 \u00b1 15.27 cells/mm 2 , P = 0.023; Fig. 1F ). There were no significant differences between CC regions in the density of single-labeled Msi1-expressing cells (Msi1+ Olig2-cells, 658.60 \u00b1 66.39 cells/mm 2 under peaks of cingulum compared to 543.70 \u00b1 120.10 cells/mm 2 in midline, P = 0.4495) or Olig2expressing cells (Msi1-Olig2+ cells, 1032.00 \u00b1 11.34 cells/mm 2 under peaks of cingulum compared to 956.30 \u00b1 178.90 cells/mm 2 in midline, P = 0.6930).",

A subset of Msi1+ cells in the P7 CC coexpressed PDGF\u03b1R (Fig. 1G ). Similar to the findings with Olig2, the density of Msi1+ PDGF\u03b1R + cells was significantly higher in the lateral CC near the SVZ (80.57 \u00b1 2.40 cells/mm 2 under the peaks of the cingulum) than in the medial CC (31.70 \u00b1 1.96 cells/mm 2 , P < 0.0001; Fig. 1I ).

Among the overall OP population, the Msi1+ PDGF\u03b1R+ cells appear to be a subpopulation preferentially localized in the white matter near the SVZ. The current focus on early transitional cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage may explain our findings relative to a previous study that did not observe colocalization of Msi in PDGF\u03b1R+ OP cells (Sakakibara and Okano, 1997) . The correlation of Msi1 with a very early stage of the lineage is also supported by a lack of Msi1 colocalization in NG2+ OP cells in both the previous study (Sakakibara and Okano, 1997) and current work in P7 mouse CC (Fig. 1H ).",

To test the function of Msi1 in OP cells, we first assessed a role in differentiation within the oligodendrocyte lineage. OP cell cultures were infected with replication-incompetent retrovirus expressing Msi1 followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter (Fig. 4A,B) . Retroviral transduction of the wild-type virus (MsiWT) significantly reduced the proportion of GFP+ cells that differentiated into oligodendrocytes (16.87% \u00b1 0.72%) compared to infection with the control retrovirus, which contained a mutant Msi1 sequence that lacked RNA binding activity (27.42% \u00b1 1.58%; P value <0.0001; Fig. 4C ). The percentage of mature oligodendrocytes seen in OP cultures infected with the control retrovirus was similar to that seen in infection of OP cultures with the empty pMX retroviral vector (Zhou et al., 2006) , demonstrating that infection with the retroviral vector itself or the control retrovirus containing mutated Msi1 does not alter differentiation. These results show that Msi1 transduction inhibits OP differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes in vitro.",

The mice were sacrificed at P28, which is after the period of active myelination. Spinal cord from the first mouse injected with each retrovirus was longitudinally sectioned on a vibratome to ensure successful infection of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and expression of GFP (Figs. 5A,B) . For subsequent mice, alternate longitudinal spinal cord sections were immunostained with either CC1 antibody, to identify mature oligodendrocytes (Fuss et al., 2000) (Figs. 5A\u2032,B\u2032), or NG2 antibody to identify OP cells (Nishiyama et al., 1996) (Figs. 5A\u2033,B\u2033) . Animals injected with MsiWT retrovirus had a significant reduction in the proportion of GFP+ cells that differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes (39.14% \u00b1 3.80%) compared to animals injected with control retrovirus (67.49% \u00b1 1.69%, P = 0.0026; Fig. 5C ). Conversely, mice injected with MsiWT retrovirus had a significantly higher proportion of GFP+ cells that were OP cells, identified as GFP+ NG2+ cells, in the dorsal funiculus (63.75% \u00b1 1.58%) compared to animals injected with the control virus (30.18% \u00b1 1.54%, P < 0.0001; Fig. 5D ). To further analyze the OP population, sections were double immunostained with NG2 and PDGF\u03b1R antibodies. The MsiWT-injected animals had a significantly larger proportion of GFP+ cells that were OP cells with immunoreactivity for both NG2 and PDGF\u03b1R (21.94% \u00b1 3.30%) compared to the control-injected animals (12.06% \u00b11.11%, P = 0.0002; images not shown). Taken together, these results show that MsiWT transduction can function in the context of a myelinating white matter tract to inhibit OP differentiation. In addition, these in vivo results indicate that Msi1 shifts the proportion of OP cells that differentiate into oligodendrocytes but does not induce an alternate OP fate; although NG2 and CC1 cells were calculated from separately immunostained sections, the combined proportions of NG2 and CC1 cells account for ~100% of the GFP+ cells (102.89% \u00b1 5.38% for MsiWT virus and 97.67% \u00b1 3.23% for control virus infections).",

MsiWT transduction significantly reduced the proportion of GFP+; cells that were cleaved caspase-3+ (5.44% \u00b1 0.13%) compared to transduction of the control retrovirus (9.90% \u00b1 1.23%; Pvalue-<0.0001; Fig. 6C ). Cells expressing cleaved caspase-3 often showed initial signs of nuclear condensation with DAPI staining (data not shown). To further challenge the protective effects of Msi1 transduction, OP cultures were transferred to cystine-free medium, which leads to glutathione depletion and induces cell death of immature oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Back et al., 1998) . In cultures maintained in cystine-free medium (Fig. 6C, Cys-) , transduction with MsiWT significantly reduced the proportion of GFP+ cells that were cleaved caspase-3+ (5.81% \u00b1 0.18%) compared to the control retrovirus (17.38% \u00b1 1.65%; P value <0.0001).

Although specific genes regulated by Msi1 are not yet known, the current findings focus the context for Msi1 function in the generation of oligodendrocytes in the postnatal CNS. In the postnatal rodent SVZ, neural stem cells give rise to early stage oligodendrocyte lineage cells that migrate to developing white matter and proliferate to generate a large pool of OP cells. Msi1 expression may act in concert with signals that maintain early oligodendrocyte lineage cells in a relatively undifferentiated state. Msi1 expression may be especially critical during early OP cell migration from the neural stem cell niche prior to interaction with oligodendrocyte survival factors in white matter tracts. Indeed, the current findings directly test a previous correlation of Msi1 expression with cell survival (Kempermann et al., 2006) and extend the potential range of Msi1 from neurogenesis to oligodendrogenesis. Furthermore, the results of the Msi1 in vivo transduction experiments showed that Msi1 expression does not block acquisition of NG2 immunoreactivity but does modulate differentiation of OP cells into mature oligodendrocytes.",

By inhibiting translation of p21 WAF-1 , Msi1 is able to regulate stem cell maintenance (Battelli et al., 2005) . Msi1 binding to p21 WAF-1 may contribute to survival of early oligodendrocyte lineage cells by temporarily inhibiting cell cycle progression. However, later in oligodendrocyte development, Msi1 binding to p21 WAF-1 is unlikely to be the mechanism by which Msi1 inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation since Msi1 overexpression would be expected to enhance proliferation and promote OP differentiation if Msi1 exerted its effect by binding to p21 WAF-1 .",

            "text": "Cells that express Msi1 persist into adulthood and may contribute to repair of damaged CNS tissues (Okano et al., 2005) . After a demyelinating episode in the CNS, OP cells proliferate to repopulate the lesioned area and then differentiate to form myelinating oligodendrocytes (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 2005) . OP cells that proliferate in response to demyelination can be identified by expression of PDGF\u03b1R (Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) . This study shows coexpression of Msi1 with both Olig2 and PDGF\u03b1R after MHV-induced demyelination in the spinal cord (see Fig. 8 ). Importantly, the density of Msi1+ Olig2+ cells was significantly higher at the time point when lesions are being repopulated by proliferating OP cells (Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) . Furthermore, recent work in our lab showed Msi1+ cells associated with lesions that were double immunolabeled for myelin transcription factor 1 (Myt1) (Vana et al., 2007) . Myt1 is expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells in normal and demyelinated mouse spinal cord tissues, but is not expressed in astrocytes. These findings demonstrate that a population of Msi1+ cells is distinct from reactive astrocytes and is identified with markers (i.e., PDGF\u03b1R, Olig2, or Myt1) indicative of early oligodendrocyte lineage cells responding to demyelination. Therefore, Msi1 may have a role in the generation of remyelinating oligodendrocytes in the adult CNS which may contribute to recovery from diseases with a demyelinating component, such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury.",

Embryonic development in Msi1 \u2212/\u2212 mice provided initial clues that Msi1 may function to regulate oligodendrocyte development. The absence of Msi1 had no effect on neurosphere number or self-renewal activity yet fewer clones contained oligodendrocytes. This result suggests that Msi1 expression influences the generation and/or survival of oligodendrocytes in the embryonic CNS. This effect of Msi1 did not require cooperative interaction with Musashi2 (Msi2) nor did Msi2 appear to compensate for this Msi1 \u2212/\u2212 reduced neurosphere multipotency (Sakakibara et al., 2002) . Further research is needed to identify targets of Msi1 RNA-binding targets and to understand the mechanisms by which Msi1 affects OP differentiation and survival. Additional study of Msi1 expression in the OP response to demyelinating diseases may elucidate potential targets for therapeutic interventions to promote the generation of remyelinating oligodendrocytes.",

There were significantly more doublelabeled cells in the CC near the SVZ than in the midline region of the CC (P < 0.0001). CC, corpus callosum; LV, lateral ventricle; SVZ, subventricular zone. Scale bars = 250 \u00b5m (A, B), 100 \u00b5m (C, D), 50 \u00b5m (E, G), 25 \u00b5m (H). Values shown are the mean \u00b1 standard error derived from counting at least 3 sections from each of 3 mice. Msi1 expression in cultured oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Immunocytochemistry performed on secondary enriched OP cell cultures prepared from brains of neonatal rat pups. A: Cells fixed 2 h after plating, immunostained for nestin (red), Msi1 (green), and GFAP (blue). Neural stem cells or pre-OP cells (nestin+ Msi1+ GFAP-; overlap of red and green appears yellow) are beginning to extend processes. White arrowheads indicate astrocytes (Msi1+ GFAP+). Inset-Black and white images of boxed area showing nestin (inset 1) and Msi1 (inset 2). B: Bipolar OP in culture maintained in defined medium with PDGF and FGF2 for 3 days, immunostained for A2B5 (red) and Msi1 (green; overlap appears yellow). C: Cells in culture maintained in defined medium without mitogens for 3 days, immunostained for O1 (red), Msi1 (green), and GFAP (blue). Mature oligodendrocytes (O1+; white arrows) have well-developed processes. Green arrow shows Msi1+ O1-GFAP-cell. White arrowheads indicate a group of contaminating astrocytes (Msi1+ GFAP+) in this field which was selected to show relative differences in Msi1 immunoreactivity among these cell types. Scale bars = 50 \u00b5m (A, B), 25 \u00b5m (C). Msi1 transduction inhibits differentiation of cultured OP cells. OP cells were infected with a replication-incompetent retroviral vector containing the Msi1 sequence (MsiWT) followed by an IRES element and GFP as a reporter. The IRES element allows Msi1 and GFP to be transcribed as a single transcript that is then translated as two separate proteins. The control retrovirus contained a mutant Msi1 sequence that lacked RNA binding capacity. Cultures were analyzed for differentiation, based on O1 immunolabeling (A-C), or proliferation, estimated from BrdU incorporation (D). A: Bipolar OP infected with MsiWT virus (GFP+, green) and noninfected mature oligodendrocyte (O1+, red). B: MsiWT infection of three OP cells (GFP +) and one mature oligodendrocyte (O1+ GFP+). C: Quantification of the percentage of O1+ oligodendrocytes among GFP+ cells in cultures infected with MsiWT (black bar) or control (white bar) retrovirus. Infection with MsiWT significantly reduced the proportion of cells that differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes compared to infection with the control virus (P value <0.0001; values shown are the mean \u00b1 standard error derived from 3 independent experiments with at least 300 cells counted for each retrovirus during each experiment). D: Cells infected with the control retrovirus, showing multiple GFP+ (green) OP cells that are actively proliferating (BrdU+, red). Scale bars = 100 \u00b5m. Msi1 transduction promotes OP survival in vitro. OP cells were infected with MsiWT or control retrovirus (see Fig. 4 ) and grown in defined medium with or without cystine for the final 18 h. Cystine-free medium induces OP cell death detected by cleaved caspase-3 immunolabeling (red in A, B). A: Examples of OP cells grown in cystine-free medium following infection with MsiWT retrovirus (GFP+ green cells, white arrowheads) with evolving apoptosis detected by immunoreactivity for activated caspase-3 among noninfected cells (A, red arrowheads). B: Examples of OP cells grown in cystine-free medium followed by infection with control retrovirus (GFP+ green cells) and showing immunoreactivity for activated caspase-3 (arrows; overlap of green and red appears yellow). White arrowhead indicates an example of an infected OP cell that is not immunolabeled for caspase-3. C: Quantification of the percentage of activated caspase-3+ cells among GFP+ cells in cultures infected with MsiWT (black bar) or control (white bar) retrovirus, maintained in cystine-containing (Cys+) or cystine-free (Cys-) medium. Infection with MsiWT significantly reduced the proportion of cells that were immunolabeled for cleaved caspase-3 compared to infection with the control virus in both conditions (*P value <0.0001; values shown are the mean \u00b1 standard error derived from three independent experiments with at least 300 cells counted for each retrovirus during each experiment). Scale bars = 25 \u00b5m. Msi1 expression is critical for OP survival in vitro. To knockdown Msi1, OP cell cultures were infected with a replication-incompetent retroviral vector containing a siRNA fragment targeting Msi1 and the ZsGreen reporter. A scrambled nucleotide sequence in the same siRNA cassette was used to generate control retrovirus. A-C: Cultured OP cells infected with control siRNA, fixed and immunostained for cleaved caspase-3 (panel B) and DAPI (panel C) 48 h after infection. The two infected OP cells (ZsGreen+; panel A) are not immunolabeled with caspase-3. D-F: Cultured OP cell infected with Msi1 siRNA (ZsGreen+, panel D), fixed and immunostained for caspase-3 (panel E) and DAPI (panel F) 48 h after infection. In addition to cleaved caspase-3 immunoreactivity (E), this cell has a swollen soma (D) and condensed chromatin (F) indicative of ongoing cell death. G: Quantification of cleaved caspase-3 detection among retrovirally labeled ZsGreen cells in OP cultures. Cells were infected with Msi1 siRNA (gray bars) or scrambled control siRNA sequence (white bars) and maintained in the presence (hatched bars) or absence (solid bars) of PDGF and FGF2. In OP cultures infected with Msi1 siRNA, a significantly larger percentage of infected cells (ZsGreen+) exhibited caspase-3 immunoreactivity at 24 and 48 h after infection compared to cultures infected with the control siRNA retrovirus. Seventy-two hours postinfection, few ZsGreen+ cells remained in the cultures infected with Msi1 siRNA. All GFP+ cells per well were counted and values shown are the mean \u00b1 standard error of the proportion as derived from at least 3 wells/ experiment and with 3 experiments assessed for each retrovirus.

The MsiWT and control retroviruses (seeFig. 4) were injected into the dorsal funiculus of P7 mice at the L5 spinal cord level to assess the effect of Msi1 transduction on OP differentiation in the environment of a myelinating fiber tract. A, B: Vibratome sections (100 \u00b5m thick) illustrating infection of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and expression of GFP with control (A, A\u2032, A\u2033) and MsiWT (B, B\u2032, B\u2033) retroviruses. The dashed white lines outline the margins of the dorsal funiculus. Adjacent cryostat sections (15 \u00b5m thick) were immunostained with either CC1 to identify mature oligodendrocytes (red,A\u2032,  B\u2033)  or NG2 to identify OP cells (red, A\u2033, B\u2033) among retrovirally labeled cells expressing GFP (green; note that overlap of green and red appears yellow).
