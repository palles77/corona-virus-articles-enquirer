            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has plagued the domestic swine industry in Korea causing significant economic impacts on pig production nationwide. In the present study, we determined the complete nucleotide sequences of the spike (S) glycoprotein genes of seven Korean PEDV isolates. The entire S genes of all isolates were found to be nine nucleotides longer in length than other PEDV reference strains. This size difference was due to the combined presence of notable 15 bp insertion and 6 bp deletion within the N-terminal region of the S1 domain of the Korean isolates. In addition, the largest number of amino acid variations was accumulated in the S1 N-terminal region, leading to the presence of hypervariability in the isolates. Sequence comparisons at the peptide level of the S proteins revealed that all seven Korean isolates shared diverse similarities ranging from a 93.6% to 99.6% identity with each other but exhibited a 92.2% to 93.7% identity with other reference strains. Collectively, the sequence analysis data indicate the diversity of the PEDV isolates currently prevalent in Korea that represents a heterogeneous group. Phylogenetic analyses showed two separate clusters, in which all Korean field isolates were grouped together in the second cluster (group 2). The results indicate that prevailing isolates in Korea are phylogenetically more closely related to each other rather than other reference strains. Interestingly, the tree topology based on the nucleotide sequences representing the S1 domain or the S1 N-terminal region most nearly resembled the full S gene-based phylogenetic tree. Therefore, our data implicates a potential usefulness of the partial S protein gene including the N-terminal region in unveiling genetic relatedness of PEDV isolates.",

The disease was first recognized in England in 1971 (Oldham, 1972) , and since then, outbreaks have been reported in Europe and Asia (Chen et al., 2008; Pensaert et al., 1981; Puranaveja et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 1983) . The causative agent of this disease, the PED virus (PEDV), was first described in 1978 (Pensaert and Debouck, 1978) . Thereafter, a suitable cell culture system for PEDV propagation was developed and successfully used for virus isolation (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . In Korea, PEDV was first recognized in 1992 (Kweon et al., 1993) ; however, a retrospective study indicated that the virus had already existed as early as 1987 (Park and Lee, 1997) . Since the emergence, a periodic vaccination strategy has been applied nationwide to control the disease on pig farms but PEDV outbreaks have continuously occurred causing tremendous economical losses to the Korean swine industry.",

            "text": "PEDV, a member of the family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped virus possessing a single-stranded positive-sense approximately 28 kb RNA genome with a 5 cap and a 3 polyadenylated tail (Pensaert and Debouck, 1978; Pensaert and Yeo, 2006) . The PEDV genome is composed of the 5 untranslated region (UTR), at least 7 open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2-6), and the 3 UTR (Kocherhans et al., 2001) . The two large ORF1a and 1b cover the 5 two-third of the genome and encode the non-structural replicase genes. The remaining ORFs in the 3 terminal region code for four major structural proteins, the 150-220 kDa glycosylated spike (S) protein, 20-30 kDa membrane (M) protein, 7 kDa envelop (E) protein, and 58 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein (Duarte and Laude, 1994; Pensaert and Yeo, 2006) . The S protein of PEDV is a type I membrane glycoprotein composed of 1383 amino acids (aa), which contains a signal peptide (1-24 aa), a large extracellular region, a single transmembrane domain (1334-1356 aa), and a short cytoplasmic tail. In addition, the S protein can be divided into S1 (1-735 aa) and S2 (736-1383 aa) domains based on its homology with S proteins of other coronaviruses (Jackwood et al., 2001; Sturman and Holmes, 1984) . As with other coronavirus S proteins, the PEDV S glycoprotein is known to play pivotal roles in interacting with the cellular receptor to mediate viral entry and inducing neutralizing antibodies in the natural host (Bosch et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2002; Godet et al., 1994) . Thus, the S glycoprotein would be a primary target for the development of effective vaccines against PEDV. It is also the major envelope glycoprotein found in the virion, which serves as an important viral component in the study to understand genetic relationships among PEDV isolates and the epidemiological status of PEDV in the field (Park et al., 2007b; Puranaveja et al., 2009; Spaan et al., 1988) . In the present study, therefore, we sought to determine the full-length sequences of the S glycoproteins of PEDV field isolates in order to investigate genetic relatedness and to understand the diversity and prevalence of PEDV isolates in Korea.",

The individual cDNA amplicons were gel-purified, cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced in both directions using two commercial vector-specific T7 and SP6 primers and the S gene-specific primers. General procedures for DNA manipulation and cloning were performed according to standard procedures (Sambrook and Russell, 2001) . The complete S glycoprotein gene sequences of the Korean PEDV isolates were deposited to the GenBank database under their accession numbers (Table 2) .",

The sequence data found that the S genes of seven Korean PEDV isolates (KNU-0801, KNU-0802, and KNU-0901-KNU-0905) consisted of 4161 nucleotides (nt) in length, which encoded 1386 amino acid residues. The complete nucleotide sequences of the Korean PEDV isolates were further compared to those of reference PEDV strains described in Table 2 . The fulllength S genes of the Korean PEDV isolates were determined to be 9 nt (3 amino acids) longer in size than that of other PEDV strains. This consequence was due to the presence of the number of inserted or deleted nucleotides that was accumulated in the N-terminus of the S1 domain ( Fig. 1) . Remarkably, the first notable insertion existed at amino acid positions 56-59 of the S protein for all seven Korean PEDV isolates followed by the presence of one additional inserted aspartic acid residue at position 140. Interestingly, the unique deletion was also located between amino acids 156 and 157 of the PEDV S protein, which is commonly present in reference PEDV strains. The S proteins of seven Korean PEDV isolates contained 25-27 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (identified by the sequence NXS/T, where X is any amino acid except proline). Deletion or modification of Nglycosylation sites was found predominantly in the N-terminus of the S1 domain. Furthermore, the largest number of amino acid differences was also clustered in the N-terminal region of the S1 domain. In addition, the genetic distances between the query strain CV777 and the Korean field isolates were plotted against the nucleotide position. Likewise, the N-terminal region of the S1 domain (1-800 bp) showed the lowest similarity with the PEDV reference strain (Fig. 2) . Taken together, our data indicate that the S1 domain including the peptide signal sequences of the Korean field isolates contain regions that exhibited sequence hypervariablity.",

Unlike the result obtained above, the full S gene-based phylogenetic tree revealed that all PEDV strains and field isolates used in the present study were defined into two separate clusters (Fig. 3B ). The first cluster (group 1; G1) included the PEDV reference strains, Korean vaccine strains (SM98P and DR13) and all Chinese strains. In contrast, the second cluster (group 2; G2) contained all Korean field isolates, including previously identified Korean field isolates Spk1 and Chinju99 that were reported formerly to belong to G2 and G3 in the S1 C-terminal based phylogenetic tree, respectively (Park et al., 2007b) . These data indicated that the Korean field isolates were more closely related to each other rather than other reference strains. More importantly, the phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotides representing either the S1 domain or the S1 N-terminal part were most closely similar to the tree based on the full-length S gene in that they also exhibit two distinct phylogenetic groups ( Fig. 3C and D, compared to Fig. 3B ). This result suggests that only the N-terminal region of the S1 domain would be sufficient for revealing genetic relatedness among the different PEDV isolates. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses on the basis of the amino acid sequences further showed the 3 .

Putative similar regions of spike proteins of other distantly related coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and human coronavirus HCoV-229E, were also included in this study.

In addition, the S protein gene is considered the most useful in revealing the genetic diversity of coronavirus isolates (Kim et al., 2003; Paton and Lowings, 1997; Puranaveja et al., 2009; S\u00e1nchez et al., 1992) . Indeed, sequence analysis based on the S protein genes of PEDV isolates has been recently reported to show the diversity of Korean PEDV isolates (Park et al., 2007b) . However, this previous study assessed only partial S protein genes including the epitope region (Chang et al., 2002) , thereby implying that the data might not represent the results expected from the full S gene-based analysis. A more precise study with the full S genes will be needed to better understand the genetic relationships among prevailing PEDVs in Korea. In the current study, therefore, the complete nucleotide and deduced peptide sequences of the S protein genes of seven Korean PEDV isolates were determined and compared with those of published PEDV reference strains. As consistent with the previous study, we demonstrated that Korean PEDV isolates undergo the genetic diversity in their S glycoprotein genes, and notably distinct results were obtained in our study.",

These nucleotide variations were found to exist within the N-terminus of the S1 domain that was excluded in the previous study. The similarity plot showed that most of the diversity between the G1 and G2 clusters is located within the 5 most 800 nt of the S gene. Although further studies would be needed to investigate this phenomenon, it might be explained by a possible recombination event with an unknown PEDV strain or other porcine coronaviruses in the field. In addition, the S1 N-terminus showed the high occurrence of amino acid mutations that led to the creation or elimination of potential N-glycosylation sites. Thus, this N-terminal part of the S1 domain contains several potential hypervariable regions which will be useful in differentiating specific PEDV isolates and in studying genetic relatedness among field isolates.",

More interestingly, sequence homology analysis of the S proteins suggests that Korean isolates are genetically diverse among themselves, showing various identities with each other. These results further indicate heterogeneity among prevailing PEDV isolates in Korea. Although the mechanism for the origin of the diversity is unclear, one possibility is that the virus might have evolved independently since PEDV introduction into Korea in the early 1990s.",

            "text": "The data obtained from the present phylogenetic analyses were strikingly different from those of the previous study. Park et al. (2007b) previously revealed that PEDV isolates are divided into three separate groups based on the partial S gene including the C-terminal region of S1 domain. In that study, most Korean isolates were found to belong to the group 1 and to be highly homologous to reference strains that includes CV777, Br1/87, Korean vaccine strains, and the Chinese strain JS-2004-2. It was further reported that the Korean isolates were distantly related to other previously identified Korean field isolates Spk1 and Chinju99. These results were reproducible in the current analysis of the same region with Korean isolates, reference strains, and Thailand isolates. However, the full S gene-based phylogenetic analysis in the present study resulted in two distinct clusters. PEDV reference strains including Korean vaccine strains and Chinese isolates were determined to belong to the group 1, whereas all Korean field isolates including Spk1 and Chinju99 were clustered together within the group 2. These data demonstrate that prevalent PEDV isolates in Korea are more closely related to each other and to other previously identified Korean isolates Spk 1 and Chinju99 rather than reference strains (CV777 and Br1/87), Korean vaccine strains (DR13 and SM98P), and all Chinese strains (DX, JS-2004-2, LJB/03, and LZC). The reason for the contradictory result is likely due to the difference of the target region analyzed between the previous and present studies, which led to the contrary interpretation of the sequence phylogeny. Nevertheless, our study indicates that the genetic analysis based on the C-terminal part of the S1 domain, including the epitope region, does not represent the entire S gene-based analysis, thereby displaying inconsistent results in the present study. It is further noteworthy that the phylogenetic tree topologies based on the S1 domain and the S1 N-terminus correspond well to the full S gene-based tree. This indicates that the N-terminal region of the S1 domain will be required for analyzing the relationships and diversity of PEDV isolates in future studies.",

The results presented here indicate that PEDV isolates prevalent in Korea represent a heterogeneous group but all isolates are phylogenetically more closely related to each other. Our data further suggest that the N-terminal region of the S1 domain may be an ideal marker for monitoring the genetic variation and for developing differential diagnostic assays. The current study should lead to a better understanding of the genetic diversity among PEDV isolates and contribute to the development of more effective vaccines.",
