It expresses various proteins that effectively circumvent IFN production at different levels via distinct mechanisms. Through the construction of recombinant IBV expressing proteins 8a, 8b and 8ab encoded by SARS-CoV ORF8, we demonstrate that expression of 8b and 8ab enables the corresponding recombinant viruses to partially overcome the inhibitory actions of IFN activation to achieve higher replication efficiencies in cells. We also found that proteins 8b and 8ab could physically interact with IRF3. Overexpression of 8b and 8ab resulted in the reduction of poly (I:C)-induced IRF3 dimerization and inhibition of the IFN-\u03b2 signaling pathway. This counteracting effect was partially mediated by protein 8b/8ab-induced degradation of IRF3 in a ubiquitinproteasome-dependent manner. Taken together, we propose that SARS-CoV may exploit the unique functions of proteins 8b and 8ab as novel mechanisms to overcome the effect of IFN response during virus infection.",

            "text": "When challenged by a viral infection, the host mounts an immediate innate immune response, leading to the production of type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) and the expression of hundreds of downstream IFNstimulated genes (ISGs) (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006; Suhara et al., 2002) . Central to the induction of type I IFN is interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (Hiscott, 2007; Taniguchi et al., 2001) . The initial step of the signaling cascade leading to IRF3 activation is recognition of specific viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in two major pathways. These include cell surface toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, which sense viral components (Kumagai et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2009a Kumar et al., , 2009b , and cytosolic RNA helicases such as retinoic acidinducible gene I (RIG-I) and/or melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), which detect viral RNA (Loo et al., 2008; Onomoto et al., 2007) . Upon binding to their ligands, PRRs recruit adaptor proteins to set off a series of signaling cascades to phosphorylate and dimerize IRF3 (Fitzgerald et al., 2003) . The activated IRF3 homodimer then translocates to the nucleus, switching on IFN synthesis (Lin et al., 1998; Suhara et al., 2002; Thanos and Maniatis, 1995) . Many viruses have also evolved strategies to counteract the IFN action, including mechanisms that allow virus to evade recognition by the immune surveillance system, so as to inhibit IFN induction by hijacking molecules involved in IFN activation pathways or by inhibiting downstream signal transduction (Goodbourn et al., 2000; Versteeg et al., 2007; Weber et al., 2003) .",

Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is an inefficient inducer of IFN-\u03b2 response in cell culture system (Spiegel et al., 2005) and is sensitive to the antiviral state induced by IFNs (Spiegel et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2004) .

For instance, SARS-CoV Papain-like protease (PLpro) attenuates IFN synthesis by abrogating IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation by physically interacting with IRF3 . IFN induction mediated by a constitutively active IRF3 is also inhibited by the de-ubiquitination activity of SARS-CoV PLpro (Matthews et al., 2014) . On the other hand, Nsp1 of PEDV does not interfere IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, but interrupts the enhanceosome assembly of IRF3 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) by promoting proteasomal degradation of CBP (Zhang et al., 2016) . Targeting further upstream, SARS-CoV M protein prevents IRF3 phosphorylation by inhibiting the assembly of TBK1/IKK complex (Siu et al., 2009) , whereas MERS-CoV M protein interacts with TRAF3 and disrupts TRAF3-TBK1 association, leading to reduced IRF3 phosphorylation (Lui et al., 2016) . Likewise, the accessory protein ORF4b of MERS-CoV has been shown to specifically bind to TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, thereby inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN-\u03b2 production .",

            "text": "Although both 8b and 8ab are encoded by SARS-CoV ORF8, they are expressed under distinct conditions. 8ab is expressed as a single protein encoded by the single continuous ORF (ORF8ab) found in SARS-CoV isolated from animals and early stage human isolates. In contrast, as a consequence of a 29-nt deletion that results in two separate overlapping ORFs (ORF8a \u2044 ORF8b), most human isolates obtained at the middle to later phase of the epidemic encode instead 8a and 8b as two distinct proteins (Guan et al., 2003; Oostra et al., 2007) . ORF8 is presumably acquired from SARS-related coronavirus from greater horseshoe bats through recombination (Lau et al., 2015) , and the 29-nt deletion may be an evolutionary adaptation for enhancing viral pathogenesis in the human host. Proteins 8a, 8b and 8ab may possess different biochemical properties and possibly cellular functions (Law et al., 2006; Le et al., 2007) . Protein 8ab was shown to be a glycosylated ER resident protein which can activate ATF6 to modulate the unfolded protein response (Sung et al., 2009) . Protein 8a was found to enhance viral replication and induce cell death (C.Y. , while 8b induces DNA synthesis and down-regulates SARS-CoV E protein via a proteasomeindependent pathway (Keng et al., 2006) . SARS-CoV 8b and 8ab were also shown to bind to both mono-and poly-ubiquitin when expressed in cell culture (Keng et al., 2006) . Whether these ubiquitin-binding properties allow them to interact with host cell proteins remains unknown. Interestingly, when an in vivo attenuated recombinant SARS-CoV lacking the full-length E gene is passaged in mice, the ORF8 sequence mutates to encode a PDZ-binding motif in protein 8a, and the virus regained virulence (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2015) .",

To assess the role of SARS-CoV 8b and 8ab in modulating viral replication, the growth properties and kinetics of the recombinant viruses were characterized and compared to wild type IBV (wtIBV). A new recombinant IBV expressing the 8a and 8b in separate ORFs (rIBV8a/b) was also constructed as a control. Vero cells, known to lack the expression of type I IFNs, were infected with wild type and recombinant IBV at an MOI of~0.5 and harvested at every 4 h over a time course of 20 h for plaque assay to determine virus titers. Consistent with our previous report on the impediment of virus replication by 8b expression, recombinant viruses expressing 8b, 8ab and 8a/b replicated at a slightly slower rate, compared to wild type virus during the first 12 h of infection ( Fig. 1a & b) . At 16 h post-infection, however, the three recombinant IBVs were able to attain titers comparable to that of wild type virus (Fig. 1b) . Expression of protein 8b or 8ab could not be detected in cells infected with rIBV8a/b using Western blot analysis (data not shown), further supporting our previous observation that 8b is not expressed from this construct (Le et al., 2007) . Taken together, these results demonstrate that the inclusion of 8b and 8ab does not render detectable enhancement effects on the replication and growth of IBV in culture cells. The slightly slower growth rates observed for the recombinant viruses at early time points of the infection cycle may be due to the introduction of extra sequences into the IBV genome. This is consistent with our previous observations that such genetic manipulations may alter the replication of IBV in cells (Le et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2009) . As expression of proteins 8a, 8b and 8ab did not render growth advantages to IBV in normal cultured cells, these proteins may not have direct functions in viral replication, especially in a heterogeneous genome context.",

The identity of this band is not certain, but it may represent a modified form of IRF3. IRF3 is well documented to be heavily targeted for post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and neddylation (Bibeau-Poirier et al., 2006; Hiscott, 2007; Kubota et al., 2008; Ran et al., 2011) . Since proteins 8b and 8ab exhibited comparable efficiency in terms of pulling down IRF3, just the 8b region was then used for subsequent pull-down experiments to pinpoint the domains in IRF3 essential for the interaction. Four deletion constructs of IRF3 either with or without a Myc-tag at the N-termini were constructed (Fig. 3a) and co-expressed with the Flag-tagged 8b. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the N-terminal region covering the first 133 residues of IRF3 (Myc-IRF3(1-133)) failed to interact with protein 8b (Fig. 3e) , suggesting that the N terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) is dispensable for the interaction. Immunoprecipitation with fragments covering residues 134-240 and 134-427, respectively, resulted in effective pulldown of 8b (Fig. 3e) , suggesting that the 134-240 region is likely to be important for the interaction. This region spans across several functional domains, including the nuclear export signal (NES), proline-rich region (Pro), and the first 47 residues of the IRF association domain (IAD). Interestingly, immunoprecipitation experiments repeated with just the N terminal fragment comprising of only the first 193 residues, thus excluding the 47 residues of IAD, abolished the binding (Fig. 3d) , indicating that just the NES and Pro regions alone were insufficient for the binding. Consistently, the full-length IRF3 with the N-terminal Myctag and the N-terminal region covering the first 375 residues could be efficiently pulled down by protein 8b (Fig. 3d) .",

At 16 h post poly (I:C) treatment, lysates were assayed for luciferase activity. Relative to cells transfected with control plasmid, poly (I:C)-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation in cells expressing 8b and 8ab were reduced to 59% and 57% respectively (Fig. 4b) . This data mirrored the results obtained from the analysis of endogenous IFN-\u03b2 transcript levels examined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR where relative levels of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in poly (I:C)-treated cells expressing 8b and 8ab were reduced to approximately 18-20% (Fig. 4c ) of control.

Interestingly, analysis of the same lysates by denaturing SDS-PAGE revealed that hyper-phosphorylated IRF3 was invariantly detected in the poly (I:C) treated cells regardless of whether they are mock infected, infected with wild type virus or the recombinant IBVs (Fig. 5a) . These observations were in agreement with the data we described in Fig. 4a . However, we did observe that the overall level of IRF3 expression was significantly reduced in cells infected with rIBV8b, both in the presence and absence of poly (I:C) treatment (Fig. 5a) . A more moderate reduction of IRF3 was also detected in cells infected with rIBV8ab (Fig. 5a) . When the mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b2 from these samples were analyzed, negligible IFN-\u03b2 induction was observed in virus-infected cells in the absence of poly (I:C) stimulation (data not shown). Among the samples treated with poly (I:C), IFN-\u03b2 induction in cells infected with rIBV8b and rIBV8ab infection was suppressed (25% and 75% relative to control wtIBV, respectively) (Fig. 5b) . Taken together, these data suggest that the observed enhanced replication of rIBV8b and rIBV8ab in the presence of poly (I:C) may be due to the diminished IFN activation owing to the down-regulation of IRF3 levels coupled to reduced IRF3 dimer formation and IFN-\u03b2 induction. 6 . Degradation of IRF3 by 8b in a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent manner. a. Degradation of IRF3 by 8b but not by a lysine-knockout mutant 8b. A lysine knockout mutant of rIBV, rIBV8bm, was created by substituting the three lysine residues (K4, K26 and K81) with arginine. Cells were then infected up to 32 h with rIBV-8b and rIBV8bm, respectively, before analyzing for IRF3 expression. The same membrane was also probed with anti-IBV N, SARS-CoV protein 8b and actin antibodies. The relative amount of IRF3 was calculated as the band intensity of the protein divided by the band intensity of actin. b. Ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IRF3. Cells transfected with either Myc-tagged ubiquitin alone or co-transfected with Flag-tagged 8b, in the presence or absence of MG132, were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Myc. Immunoprecipitates were then probed for pull-down of endogenous IRF3 with specific antibodies. The relative amount of IRF3 was calculated as the band intensity of the protein divided by the band intensity of actin.",

Mutation of these lysine residues enhanced the stability of the 8b protein. As shown in Fig. 6a , while the mutant 8bm protein was readily detected in rIBV8bminfected cells at 20 and 32 h post-infection, protein 8b was not detected under the same conditions (Fig. 6a) . This is consistent with previous reports of the instability of 8b protein and that protein 8b could only be detected in rIBV8b-infected cells in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (Le et al., 2007) . IRF3 was down-regulated in cells infected with rIBV8b at both 20 and 32 h post-infection (Fig. 6a) .

However, some viruses exploit this mode of regulation by expressing viral proteins that promote untimely proteasomal degradation of IRF3 (Z. Saira et al., 2009; Sen et al., 2009) . To affirm the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the down-regulation of IRF3 observed with 8b, IRF3 stability was studied in cells overexpressing protein 8b in the presence of ubiquitin. Over-expression of 8b together with ubiquitin resulted in a reduction of detectable levels of IRF3 compared to cells expressing ubiquitin alone (Fig. 6b) . This degradation was partially suppressed in the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 6b) . In a previous study, we found that proteasome-mediated rapid degradation of protein 8b could be much more efficiently inhibited by NLVS than did lactacystin (Le et al., 2007) . As the supply of NLVS was discontinued, we chose to use MG132, a product shown similarly mild inhibitory effect as lactacystin in the suppression of proteasome-mediated degradation of protein 8b, in this study.",

A construct expressing the phosphomimetic form of IRF3 (IRF3-5D) was constructed, which contains amino acid substitutions at positions 396, 398, 402, 404, and 405 by the phosphomimetic aspartic acid. IRF3-5D undergoes spontaneous dimerization leading to IFN-\u03b2 induction (Grandvaux et al., 2002; Lin et al., 1999) . Over-expression of proteins 8b and 8ab was able to reduce the IRF3-5D-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity to approximately 58% and 49% to that of control, respectively (Fig. 7a ). This suggests that 8b can act on IRF3 at step(s) that is downstream of its activation. When protein 8b is co-expressed with IRF3-5D, 8b reduces the expression of IRF3-5D in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7b) . For reasons yet to be known, we observed that the expression of a monomeric form of IRF3-5D seemed to be more affected by the presence of 8b than its homodimeric counterpart. Similar to results presented earlier with endogenous IRF3, IRF3-5D levels was partially rescued with the addition of MG132, indicating the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Fig. 7c) .",

ORF8 failed to show up in the screen for interferon antagonist in a previous study , likely due to the incomplete inhibition of IFN activation exhibited by ORF8. Other reasons could include the low expression of 8b in their system owing to the inherent instability of the protein (Le et al., 2007) , and/or that the antagonistic activity of 8b is not apparent in their NDV model because the IFN antagonistic activity of this protein may be specific to coronavirus infection due to the requirement of other viral proteins.

The other significant finding from this study is that 8b and 8ab directly physically interact with IRF3 and that 8b-IRF3 interaction involves part of the IAD domain that is responsible for the formation of IRF3 homodimers. Over-expression of 8b and 8ab appears to have a more profound effect on IRF3 dimerization than on its phosphorylation status. Although it is still unclear whether this is a consequence of assay insensitivity or that the inhibitory actions of 8b and 8ab bypass the step of phosphorylation and targets specifically on the event of IRF3 dimerization, we are inclined to believe that it is the latter owing to the ability of 8b to suppress IFN-\u03b2 induced by constitutively active phosphomimetic IRF3-5D. While disruption to the dimerization event as a result of direct steric interference brought about by 8b interaction at the IAD domain is an attractive model, the exact mechanisms can only be ascertained through more in-depth studies such as structural analysis.",

            "text": "We previously reported that the 8b region of SARS-CoV proteins 8b and 8ab consists of domains that allow for ubiquitin binding, ubiquitination and glycosylation (Le et al., 2007) . Based on these finding, we proposed that the 8b region may mediate the binding of 8b and 8ab to ubiquitinated cellular proteins, such as p53 and I\u03baB\u03b1 (Le et al., 2007) . Here we showed that IRF3, another protein regulated by ubiquitination (Siu et al., 2009; Spiegel et al., 2004) , interacts with proteins 8b and 8ab, suggesting that the ubiquitin-binding properties of 8b region could allow them to interact with multiple cellular proteins. It would be interesting to find out what other cellular targets bind to 8b and 8ab and whether they have a regulatory role during SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, expression of 8b and 8ab appears to regulate the stability and function of IRF3 by promoting degradation of IRF3 in a ubiquitin/ proteasome-dependent manner. Several viral proteins have been reported to cause proteasomal degradation of IRF3 (Z. Saira et al., 2009; Sen et al., 2009 ). IRF3 degradation is typically triggered post-infection, when viral infection-induced IRF3 activation leads to the ubiquitination of the protein targeting it for proteasomal degradation Liu et al., 2005) . This serves to regulate type I IFN production as excessive IFN is detrimental to the cells. In this study, we observed IRF3 degradation even in the absence of strong IRF3 activation in cells infected with rIBV8b and rIBV8ab, suggesting that the 8b-and 8ab-mediated IRF3 degradation is not the result of a typical negative feedback mechanism to bring the IFN level back to the physiological level at the end of viral infection as observed with other virus infection, but may be an active step undertaken by the virus to limit IRF3 activation during its course of replication.",

This is especially true since SARS-CoV has a strong inhibitory effect on IFN induction plausibly owing to the expression of multiple viral proteins that antagonize the pathway in myriad ways during the earlier stages of infection. A possible explanation may come from a study carried out by Spiegel and coworkers who reported that while nuclear translocation of IRF3 remains unabated by SARS-CoV infection during the early stages of infection at 8 h post-infection, IRF3 activation is specifically blocked during later stages of SARS-CoV infection at 16 h post-infection (Spiegel et al., 2005) . This coincides with the late expression of 8b during SARS-CoV infection (Keng et al., 2006) .",

Theoretically, only protein 8ab is produced in cells infected with this virus, whereas both proteins 8a and 8b are produced in the wild type control.

Since IFN antagonist function is also possessed by other SARS-CoV proteins (such as nsp1, PLpro, M and N), it is possible that loss of functional 8b in rSARS-CoV-\u0394[6-9b] is compensated, and thus the recombinant virus is not attenuated in vivo.
