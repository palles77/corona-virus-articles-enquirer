Thus, in the absence of the immune system, the MHV strains assayed exhibit differences in viral tropism, cytopathic changes, and viral assembly in CNS cells, and these differences (Knobler et al., 1981b) or a demyelinating disease, depending upon the age of the animal at the time of inoculation and the virus passage level (Haspel et al., 19'78; Herndon et al., 1975; Lampert et al., 1973; Stohlman and Weiner, 1981; Weiner, 1973) . In contrast, a chemically induced temperature-sensitive mutant of wt-JHM, ts8-JHM, rarely induces fatal encephalomyelitis in the same mouse strains but regularly leads to demyelination (Haspel et al., 1978) . In viva electron microscopic and immunocytochemical studies have shown that neurons do not appear to support replication of ts&JHM, while oligodendrocytes do (Knobler et al., 1981a) . Finally, a hepatotropic MHV strain, A59 (Sturman and Takemoto, 1972) , can also produce chronic CNS disease in CBH mice (K. V. Holmes and P. 0. Leinikki, unpublished observations.) A59 is presently the best characterized coronavirus strain: it has three virion-associated polypeptides which have been isolated and purified Holmes et al., 1981 Sturman and Holmes, 1977; Sturman et al., 1980) . The membrane glycoprotein El appears to be involved in virus assembly, while the peplomeric glycoprotein Ez is required for infectivity and virus-induced cell fusion. Monospecific antibodies have been raised against these proteins as well as to detergent-disrupted virions (Sturman et al., 1980) .",

Cultures of dissociated CNS cells were obtained from spinal cord dissected from 12-to 13-day-old C57B1/6 mouse embryos as described before (Faulkner et al., 1979; Hooghe-Peters et al., 1979) . C57B1/6 mice are permissive for the JHM strains. Cells were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips or 35-mm petri dishes coated with collagen and supplemented with medium as described (Faulkner et al., 1979; Hooghe-Peters et al., 1979) . Fibroblast growth was inhibited by a 2-day antimitotic treatment with a mixture of FudR and uridine after 1 week in vitro. Cultures were used after 2 to 3 weeks of in vitro maturation when neurons and astrocytes had acquired their mature stage (Figs. la and b). Three cell types were identified in these cultures. The neurons represent 5 to 10% of the cells; they are either isolated or in clusters and show a characteristic morphology with long processes as seen by phase microscopy ( Fig. la) (Faulkner et al., 1979; Hooghe-Peters et al., 1979) . The nonneuronal (NN) cells are comprised of at least two cell types as judged on the basis of positive or negative immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a specific protein of astrocytes (Bignami et al., 1980) . GFAP+ cells represent 50 to 70% of the NN cells; these astrocytes have a pleiomorphic shape, contain radiating fibrils, and form groups under the neurons. GFAP-cells probably represent primary fibroblastic cells of CNS origin (meningeal or perivascular).",

            "text": "Four different rabbit antisera were used. Rabbit antiserum against GFAP was kindly provided by Dr. Rebecca Pruss; the rabbit had been injected with a suspension of human spinal cord. When reacted with cord proteins separated by agar gel electrophoresis, immune reactivity of this serum was found to be restricted to GFAP. Preparation and characterization of monospecific polyclonal rabbit antisera to the isolated El and Ez glycoproteins of A59 virion envelope has been previously described (Sturman et al., 1980) . Rabbit antisera directed against gradient-puri-fied NP40-disrupted A59 virions were also prepared. This hyperimmune serum immunoprecipitated the three major structural polypeptides of both A59 and JHM from radiolabeled infected cells. For fluorescent antibody (FA) staining, dissociated CNS cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in a mixture of 5% acetic acid and 95% ethyl alcohol at -20\" (for GFAP staining) or in acetone (for El or Ez staining) before being incubated for 1 hr in various dilutions of antisera. In some instances, living cells were incubated with antiviral sera at 4' or room temperature in order to detect only antigens on the cell surface. The second reagent used to detect bound antibodies was either protein Afluorescein (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N. J.) or goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to fluorescein. This conjugate was absorbed with liver powder or 17CL 1 cells. For immunoperoxidase labeling, staining was performed as described before (Knobler et al., 1981a) . Briefly, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde with 0.3 to 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 20 min, frozen and thawed in a sucrose-glycerol mixture in order to render the cell membrane permeable to antibody molecules. The cells were then allowed to react with antibody to the virion or to glycoprotein El or Ez. Protein A-peroxidase was used as a second layer and cells were further incubated in the peroxide-diaminobenzidine substrate. Immediate observations by light microscopy were done on a Zeiss photomicroscope III using a water immersion phase contrast (40X) objective for immunoperoxidase or an oil immersion (40x) objective for fluorescence.",

After washing with serum containing medium, the coverslips were incubated successively in: (1) rabbit antiserum to GFAP, (Faulkner et al., 1979) , glass coverslips covered with cells were used for scanning electron microscopy @EM), whereas 35mm petri dishes were used for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. Cells were usually fixed with Karnovsky fixative consisting of a mixture of 1.25% glutaraldehyde and 1% formaldehyde in 0.06 M cacodylate buffer at pH 7.2. For SEM studies, cells were then postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 2 hr, and dehydrated in methanol, critical point dried in COz in a Balzer apparatus, coated under high vacuum with gold-palladium alloy, and observed in an ETEC Autoscan at 20 kV and a tilt angle of 45'. For TEM studies, monolayers in petri dishes that had been labeled by the immunoperoxidase method (as described above) or fixed in situ with the Karnovsky fixative, were postfixed with osmium tetroxyde 1% in cacodylate buffer for 30 min, stained with uranyl acetate at pH 5, progressively dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in Epon 812. The technique for circling and drilling out immunolabeled cells or syncytia from the embedded monolayer has been published in detail (Knobler et al., 1981a) . Sections were cut with a diamond knife and examined in Philips 201 or Philips 400-T electron microscopes. Thin sections were usually counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead salts, and examined at 80 kV. proteins between 16 and 18 hr. Titers of JHM was examined successively in inreleased virus were always lower than ti-fected neurons and NN cells. Infected neuters of CNS cells infected with A59 strain rons showed diffuse immunofluorescent (Table 1) PI, the organization of the cytoplasm of infected neurons was not altered since they had an extensive rough ER system and a normal distribution of other organelles. Budding and free virions with electron-lucent centers were detected in cisternae of smooth membranes closely associated with the Golgi apparatus (Figs.  2a, b) . Virus was also found occasionally in small vacuoles within dendrites (Fig.  2~ ) as seen in infected mouse spinal cord in tivo (Knobler et al., 1981a) . At 48 hr PI, the cytoplasm of infected neurons showed disorganization of RER membranes and vacuolization.",

Mild fusion of NN cells was observed and infection lasted for 5 to 10 days. Infected GFAP+ cells progressively retracted their fibrillar processes. A59-infected cultures produced 10 times more infectious virus than those infected with wt-JHM (Table 1 ) even though wt-JHM replicated in both neurons and NN cells. Infected astrocytes were wrapped around healthy, apparently uninfected neurons as seen by EM (Fig. 7) . These astrocytes were very rich in intermediate filaments and contained numerous viral particles in their ER system (Fig. 7) . The inset of Fig. 7 shows a virion in a vacuole close to the cell surface. The glycoprotein Ez was detected as early as 8 hr PI and localized throughout the cytoplasm of infected NN cells, while El, first detected at 16 hr, remained predominately perinuclear (Figs. 8a and b) . Such differential localization of these proteins has been observed in infected 17CL 1 fibroblasts (E. W. Doller et al., submitted for publication). Interestingly, virus maturation in perinuclear cisternae was frequently noted by EM (Fig. 8~) the lumen of the RER (Fig. 8d) . These tubular structures had a higher density than cellular microtubules. A59-infected NN cells also showed some membrane whorls but these were smaller than those observed in ts&JHM infection of NN cells (Fig. 7) . DISCUSSION The present study describes how three different MHV strains interact in vitro with cultured neurons and NN cells, including astrocytes, isolated from mouse spinal cords. Previous studies have demonstrated that persistent infection with the JHM strain could be obtained in cloned cell lines of glial and neuronal origin (Lucas et al., 1977 (Lucas et al., ,1978 Stohlman and Weiner, 1978) . Here, we have used primary cultures of differentiated nerve cells, an in vitro system that seems closer to the in viva situation. Our observations are summarized in Table 2 .",

Wt-JHM never produces fusion of neurons as do other viruses , but rather induces neuronal rounding and lysis with little virus release. Simultaneously, extensive fusion and virus production occur in the nearby NN cells. Thus wt-JHM has very different effects in these two CNS cell types. In addition, the peplomeric glycoprotein Ez was not detected in infected neurons but was observed in NN cells. Thus, JHM virions produced in neurons may either lack Ez or have an altered E2 no longer reacting with antisera used. Virions lacking peplomers and E2 are formed in A59-infected 17CL 1 cells treated with tunicamycin (Holmes et al., 1981 . Thus it is possible for buds lacking Ez to form but such buds are known to be noninfectious (Holmes et al., 1981 . The possible differences in E2 glycoprotein synthesis between neurons and NN cells infected with wt-JHM should be further studied provided that purified neuron cultures could be obtained (Knobler et al., 1982) .",

TEM analysis of these stages reveals that a close interaction between a folded nucleocapsid strand and a virus-modified ER membrane is occurring during the budding process, as is the case for other enveloped RNA viruses. There is a close association of the virus maturation sites with the Golgi system. Virus contained in vacuoles is \"secreted\" since these vacuoles eventually fuse with the plasma membrane . This release process is also observed with other enveloped viruses undergoing intracellular maturation such as herpes simplex (Rodriguez and Dubois-Dalcq, 1978) . A59 infected CNS cultures produce more virus than wt-JHM infected ones, even though A59 infects only NN cells in a slow, progressive way. In addition, differential but not in wt-JHM-infected NN cells. In A59 infections, the membrane glycoprotein El appears to remain in the Golgi area while the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 migrates rapidly to the plasma membrane ( Figs. 8a and b) . In contrast, the E2 synthesized in NN cells by the JHM strains did not disperse rapidly but remained near the cell center (Fig. 3, inset) . Possibly the signals for migration of the E2 glycoprotein are different for the JHM and A59 strains of MHV. These differences may account, at least in part, for the different yields of virus from cells infected with wt-JHM or A59.",
