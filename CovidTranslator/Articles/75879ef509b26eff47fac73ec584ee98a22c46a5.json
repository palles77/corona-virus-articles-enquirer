For example, during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, attack rates were more than 50% in healthcare workers. 1 Healthcare workers who see pilgrims during Hajj (the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Makkah) may be at higher risk of acquiring respiratory and other infections. 2, 3 Because of these risks, special immunization requirements have been proposed to protect healthcare workers, 4 although healthcare workers have not been included in previous studies of respiratory diseases during Hajj. 2, 5 Hajj is the largest annual mass gathering in the world; it brings more than two million people from different countries together in a small, confined area. The extreme overcrowding of pilgrims during Hajj reaches about 7 persons per meter; combined with fatigue and extremely hot weather during much of the year, this crowding may increase the risk of transmitting air-and droplet-borne infectious diseases, particularly respiratory viruses. 3,5e7 An estimated one in three pilgrims experience respiratory symptoms. 6 Several transmissible bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens have been reported among pilgrims, notably meningococci of all serotypes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, atypical organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza A and B viruses, rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses. 5,6,8e10 In April of 2009, a novel influenza A strain (H1N1 2009 strain) in Mexico spread globally. 11, 12 The toll was particularly heavy in Saudi Arabia, which ranked fourth of 22 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region in deaths and probable H1N1 cases. 13 The 2009 Hajj took place in November, six months later, and presented a public health challenge for infection control authorities in Saudi Arabia. 14 Several practices to minimize disease transmission among pilgrims and healthcare workers were instituted even before the beginning of Hajj season, since pre-Hajj data showed low acceptance rates of H1N1 vaccine among healthcare workers. 15, 16 This study evaluated the prevalence of viral respiratory pathogens among healthcare workers during the 2009 Hajj which coincided with the influenza A H1N1 2009 pandemic.",

The main source or vehicle of H1N1 transmission as recognized by them were contact with people infected with H1N1 (86%), contaminated fomites (72%) and air (65%). Appreciable level of knowledge about measures to avoid H1N1 infection were noted as described by maintenance of hand hygiene (91%), wearing a mask (76%), cough/sneeze etiquette (76%), staying away from sick people (65%), using hand sanitizer (63%), avoiding crowds/public gatherings (62%) and taking H1N1 vaccine (58%).",

Rhinoviruses were more prevalent after the Hajj (11.7%) than before (7.5%). None of the healthcare workers tested positive for any influenza virus, including the H1N1 2009 pandemic strain. This is explained by the fact that among more than two million pilgrims in 2009, the Ministry of Health reported only 100 cases of H1N1 and 5 deaths. 17 The high case-fatality ratio may be because pilgrims were committed to completing Hajj and delayed seeking medical care until their condition had worsened. 17, 18 Since the overall number of cases among pilgrims was low, therefore, the chances of transmitting it to healthcare workers were very small.",

These findings agree with our finding of rhinovirus as the predominantly isolated virus (12.6%), followed by coronavirus 229E (0.6%), in a group of subjectively healthy healthcare workers. Arruda et al. isolated a high percentage of viruses because the subjects were symptomatic, while in our study rhinovirus was detected in 21% of participants with respiratory symptoms and in 30% who got sick during Hajj. Rhinoviruses spread efficiently in families, in school groups, among university students, and on military bases. 26, 27 Linde et al. 28 found an increase in the proportion and number of rhinovirus diagnoses that roughly parallels a decrease in influenza diagnoses, after the summer holidays and start of schools. They hypothesize that a rhinovirus epidemic could interfere with the spread of pandemic influenza in a warm and humid climate, which decreases the spread of influenza by aerosol. A similar phenomenon may be responsible for the frequent isolation of rhinoviruses in the present study. Rhinoviruses may protect the host from being infected by other viruses such as influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, coronaviruses, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and RSV. 29 Rhinovirus shedding is commonly limited to 10e14 days in immunocompetent subjects. 24 However viral RNA may be present from days before symptoms occur to five or more weeks after they go away. 30, 31 The influenza A H1N1 vaccination rate in healthcare workers has been reported to be lower than the seasonal influenza vaccination rate 16, 32, 33 and was 22% versus 51% in the current study. These results are also comparable to the data obtained from the United States for the same period: where vaccination coverage for H1N1 in healthcare workers was 37% and for seasonal influenza it was 62%. 32, 33 In conclusion, we found that rhinoviruses were the most frequently isolated viruses in a group of subjectively healthy middle-aged healthcare workers who treated Hajj pilgrims during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic. Respiratory symptoms were present in 21% of the healthcare workers in which the virus was detected. None of the participants had influenza A H1N1 2009, despite that only 22% of them were vaccinated against H1N1 vaccine, possibly because it was also infrequently found among pilgrims.
