            "text": "EditordSince December 2019, cases of pneumonia caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread rapidly around the globe, including Asia, North America, Europe, and Africa. 1 The 2019 novel coronavirus is likely similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. They belong to the Betacoronavirus genus and can cause severe respiratory disease, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary oedema, and respiratory failure. 2 Tracheal intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation is the mainstay therapy to correct hypoxaemia. Preoxygenation with the standard bag-valve mask oxygenation followed by rapid-sequence intubation has been proposed in non-severely hypoxaemic critically ill patients requiring tracheal intubation to reduce the risk of aspiration and desaturation. However, a previous study reported that 23% of patients had SpO 2 <90% during intubation. 3 Thus far, more than 80000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 has been described, including in many healthcare workers. 4, 5 Rapid-sequence fibreoptic bronchoscopic tracheal intubation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may reduce the risk of viral spread. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) during fibreoptic bronchoscopic intubation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia compared with standard mask oxygenation (SMO). This study was approved by the ethics committee of the General Hospital of Central Theatre Command and registered at http://www.chictr.org/cn/ (registration number: ChiCTR2000029658). Inclusion criteria were adults (aged >18 yr), with clinically-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and hypoxaemia (defined as the ratio of arterial oxygen tension [PaO 2 ] to inspiratory oxygen fraction [FIO 2 ] <300 mm Hg), and requiring intubation in the ICU. Patients were randomly allocated to the HFNO group or the SMO group.",

During attempts at tracheal intubation, HFNO was maintained for the HFNO group, whereas no oxygen was administered for the SMO group. After removal of the bronchoscope, successful intubation was confirmed by capnography. If SpO 2 <90% occurred during intubation, bronchoscopy was terminated and face-mask ventilation was initiated to correct desaturation. The primary endpoint was the total time of intubation, defined as the sum of the time spent from the beginning of bronchoscopy until proper tracheal tube placement was confirmed. The secondary endpoints included the lowest SpO 2 during intubation, incidence of mask ventilation for SpO 2 <90%, PaO 2 /FIO 2 before intubation, incidence of SpO 2 <80% during intubation, incidence of minimum SpO 2 >95% during intubation, and 7 day mortality.",

Direct laryngoscopy, inadequate sedation, coughing during laryngoscopy, and manual ventilation are consistently associated with increased risk of transmission as a result of the generation of natural aerosols. 8 Therefore, tracheal intubation and mask ventilation are considered high-risk procedures as they intensify viral spread. 9,10 To reduce tracheal-intubationinduced coughing and subsequent spread of virus, we recommended intubation after rapid-sequence intubation of general anaesthesia using visual fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Although we have no evidence that fibreoptic tracheal intubation can prevent airborne viral transmission from patient to healthcare provider, it may increase the distance between the anaesthesiologist and the patient's airway. The six anaesthesiologists in the current study are currently not infected. According to the results of a recent study, HFNO use in patients with bacterial pneumonia was not associated with an increase in air or surface contamination. 11 In contrast, mask ventilation before tracheal intubation can generate more aerosols.",
