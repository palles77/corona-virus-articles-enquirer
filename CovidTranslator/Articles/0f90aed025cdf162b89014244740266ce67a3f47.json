[7] [8] [9] However, data on the extent to which several Asia countries have recently fared with regard to improvement in stroke outcomes are relatively sparse. One study suggested the incidence of stroke decreased from 1961 to 2000 in Japan 7 and an overview study revealed that recurrent stroke decreased in each decade from 1960 to 2010. 10 Certainly more nationwide data on the evolving nature and trajectory of stroke in Asia are needed for research and planning purposes. The objective of this study was to explore risk factors, medication use, incidence, and one-year recurrence of stroke using the entire population in Taiwan by National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).",

A prior study validating the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke in National Health Insurance claims data using the Taiwan Stroke Registry as a reference revealed a positive predictive value of 88.4% and sensitivity of 97.3%. 11 Another cross-sectional study showed that among confirmed cases of acute ischemic stroke in a hospital medical record, 94.5% were assigned 'ischemic stroke' as the principal diagnosis in the NHIRD. 12 We only enrolled patients receiving brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during hospitalization with the assumption that all patients with symptoms of acute stroke should receive brain imaging. This approach was intended to exclude stroke patients who were hospitalized for rehabilitation during chronic stage. Although brain imaging, especially CT, may not be able to reveal the cerebral infarction in patients with symptoms or signs of acute stroke, it can easily exclude intracranial hemorrhage.

We found both incidence and recurrence of stroke dropped in May and June in 2003, which was during the fierce SARS epidemic in Taiwan. During that period of time, patients and medical doctors were less inclined to facilitate hospitalization unless the patient's condition was highly severe.

Among hospital admissions with stroke as the primary diagnostic code during 2001 to 2009, hospitalizations for ischemic stroke increased substantially in Korea. 16 This apparent rise in annual ischemic stroke incidence in Korea was likely due to an increase in the country's elderly population. 16 However, the median age of the current study in Taiwan did not change during the study period. Moreover, a comparison of survey data obtained in 2002 vs. 1993-1996 showed a significant improvement in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control in Taiwan, which may have contributed to its declining incidence of ischemic stroke. 17 Ischemic stroke incidence in the population aged 35-74 years was 226 per 100,000 person-years (including first-ever and recurrent ischemic stroke) in Korea 146 per 100,000 persons in our population aged 18 years or older (first-ever ischemic stroke only); while the annual rate of recurrent ischemic stroke was about 5.0% in Japan during 2007 to 2009 vs. a 7.7% annual recurrent stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) rate noted in Taiwan. 18 In the Fukuoka ischemic stroke registry, mean age was 70 years, 76% had hypertension, 27% diabetes mellitus, 46% hyperlipidemia, and 26% atrial fibrillation. 19 Our study had similar frequencies of stroke risk factors except only 10% patients had atrial fibrillation in this study. Since diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in hospitalized ischemic stroke patients typically relies on a single baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram or history of atrial fibrillation, it is conceivable that the frequency of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in admitted ischemic stroke patients in Taiwan might be underestimated. Among ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation in this study, 34% vs. 10% in a Chinese ischemic stroke registry, 20 received oral anticoagulants during hospitalization. The underuse of oral anticoagulant therapy in eligible Asian stroke patients during hospitalization may in part be due to concerns about hemorrhagic transformation. Also, 31% patients received statin therapy in this study at discharge vs. 35% in Fukuoka stroke registry, which is highly comparable. 21 As compared to a prior study based on the control arms of clinical trials for secondary stroke prevention, the current study had higher recurrent rate of stroke (8% vs. 5% 10 ). The difference may exist in the prior study excluded patients with atrial fibrillation or severe carotid stenosis 10 while this study included all first-ever ischemic stroke patients. Also, people participating in clinical trials may receive more rigorous risk factors control, which turns out to have lower recurrent stroke. Furthermore, the current study enrolled patients in the acute stage when the risk of recurrent stroke is high, whereas secondary stroke prevention trials, in general, enrolled patients after the acute stage. We found the one-year recurrent stroke was declining from 2000 to 2011, which may be explained by increasing use of statin (8.8% to 30.8%), antiplatelet agents (76.1% to 86.6%), and oral anticoagulant agents in atrial fibrillation (30.0% to 34.5%) during hospitalization among this period of time.",

However, it would seem that the magnitude of reduction for incident stroke seen in Western nations of approximately 20% was much greater than the more modest 9% decrease noted in Taiwan. We observed a rise in the use of statins, antiplatelet agents, and oral anticoagulant agents for atrial fibrillation in Taiwan during this period of time, which probably contributed to the declining rate of stroke, but there appears to more room for improvement in risk factor control if Taiwan hopes to gain at least the same level of decrease in incident stroke observed in Western countries.",

Stroke patients received antiplatelet were 76.1% in 2000-2003, 85.3% in 2004-2007 and 86.6% in 2008-2011, respectively. There was 30.0% in 2000-2003, 28.9% in 2004-2007, and 34.5% in 2008-2011, respectively, of ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation received oral anticoagulant agents during the hospitalization. The incidence rate of ischemic stroke for people aged 18 years or older decreased gradually from 2000 (142.3 per 100,000 persons) to 2011 (129.5 per 100,000 persons) except there was an obvious drop in 2003 then increased in 2004 (Figure 1). One-year stroke recurrent rate decreased gradually which was 9.61% in 2000 and decreased to 7.27% in 2011 except there was an obvious drop in 2003 then increased in 2004 (Figure 2). Compare to women, men had a higher incident rate and recurrent rate of stroke. We suspected the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 14 March 2003 through 5 July 2003 in Taiwan, may cause decreasing rate of ischemic stroke hospitalization. To explore the possible explanation for the drop of stroke incidence in 2003, we compared the stroke incidence in March through July from 2002 to 2004 and found that stroke incidence was substantially decreased in May and June, 2003, as compared to May and June in 2002 and 2004(Table 2).",
