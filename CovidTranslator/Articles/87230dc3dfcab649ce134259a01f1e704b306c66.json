For instance, the point prevalence of depressive symptoms (33%) or of generalized anxiety disorder (40%) is strongly increased in survivors two years after ARDS (5) . An increased risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is present in 29% of ARDS patients (6) . Further, a prospective cohort study showed that five years after the disease, the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of survivors of ARDS was reduced by about one standard deviation as compared to a matched control population (7) . Finally, a systematic review from 2006 (8) found that HRQoL of survivors of ARDS was significantly reduced in nearly all domain-specific pooled scores of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) (9) as compared to population norms.",

Only low scores in LIS proved to be a significant determinant for reduced HRQoL measured using a dimension of the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) modified for lung function (12, 20) . A few studies examined the etiology of ARDS in more depth (14, 18, 19, 21) . In the SF-36 domains, sepsis-induced ARDS, as compared to trauma-induced ARDS, was associated with small to moderate negative effects in the SF-36 domains as compared to traumainduced ARDS (21) .

Raker, PhD \u2022 Return to work (RtW) has been an endpoint in only a few studies. \u2022 Significant associations with HRQoL were shown in various studies only for determinants that had a narrow content and temporal relation to the scales of the HRQoL instruments. This applies in particular to some values of the pulmonary function testing (spirometry) and to the presence of psychiatric symptoms. \u2022 Future research should focus on methodologically adequate investigation of determinants that enable the identification of risk groups or concrete preventive measures in terms of intervention options during the acute treatment phase.
