            "text": "Background Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among young children in developing countries. Information on the incidence of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) infections in developing countries, especially among rural children, is very limited. Objectives This study was conducted to identify whether these viruses were associated with ARTI among children B5 years of age in rural and peri-urban populations in South India. Methods The study was cross-sectional with prospective sample collection. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from children B5 years of age presenting with ARTI. None of the children in this study were known to have any immunosuppressive conditions. The two viruses, hMPV and HBoV, were identified using semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and one-step PCR assays, respectively. The lower limits of detection of hMPV and HBoV were 6.69 9 10 5 plasmid copies and 5.77 9 10 3 plasmid copies, respectively, per 5 lL PCR reaction input. Results The frequency of hMPV infection in children was higher than that of HBoV infection. The different frequencies of hMPV in patients in various age groups with upper and lower respiratory tract infections were compared, and the variance was found to be insignificant. In the 38 children who were hMPV positive, the majority (73.7 %) were from rural communities. The overall hMPVpositive rate was higher in the rural population than in the peri-urban population, but the difference was statistically insignificant. The youngest age at which hMPV-positive status was recorded was 5 months. Conclusion This study demonstrated that hMPV was associated with a significant number (i.e.[10 %) of ARTIs in children in South India, whereas a relatively smaller number of HBoV infections was observed.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a leading cause of illness, especially in pediatric patients. The common respiratory viruses include rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, and coronaviruses [1] [2] [3] . However, one third of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and half of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are left undiagnosed. Since the initial discovery of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in the Netherlands in 2001, and human bocavirus (HBoV) in Sweden in 2005, these viruses have become recognized as important pathogens responsible for ARTIs in children [4] . These viruses are also important causes of ARTI in the elderly and in immunocompromised patients. hMPV belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family and has a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome, which includes eight genes coding for nine different proteins [5] . HBoV belongs to the Parvoviridae family and has single-stranded DNA [6] . hMPV and HBoV are now considered important viral pathogens that cause undiagnosed LRTI and URTI in children less than 5 years of age when not tested for [6, 7] . hMPV and HBoV cannot be cultivated reliably in many commonly used cell lines; however, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection in clinical specimens has been successful. Little is known about the prevalence of hMPV and HBoV among young children from rural communities in South India.",

The plasmids were used for examining the lower limit of detection and as positive controls in every PCR run. The probability of detecting hMPV and HBoV plasmids in a suspension of a known concentration in the presence of defined DNA copy numbers was determined essentially as described previously [10] . The lower limit of detection for PCR was determined using plasmid dilutions and appropriate negative controls (nuclease-free water). A negative control was included after each triplicate of every dilution tested. Amplification shown in the highest dilution (the lowest concentration) in at least two replicates of the triplicates tested at each dilution was taken as the lower limit of detection as plasmid copies/lL. The approximate number of plasmid copies/lL of DNA suspension was thus established. The lower limits of detection of the seminested PCR assay for hMPV and the one-step PCR assay for HBoV were 6.69 9 10 5 plasmid copies and 5.77 9 10 3 plasmid copies, respectively, per 5 lL PCR reaction input.

When a subset of 50 samples (sample nos. 250-300) were tested for hBOV, using the nested PCR format, one sample was additionally shown to be positive for HBoV.

In our study, collection of nasopharyngeal samples was difficult in terms of both non-compliance by parents and non-cooperation by children. Thus, instead of simply collecting throat swabs, we collected oropharyngeal swabs. In our opinion, these swabs should be of adequate sensitivity for virus detection. This approach has been found to be satisfactory for detection of respiratory viruses [21, 22] . Kim et al. [23] recently assessed the relative performance of nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab specimens from pediatric and adult patients. The two methods did not differ significantly for detection of human metapneumovirus and other viruses such as influenza A (H3N2) virus, parainfluenza virus 1, or respiratory syncytial virus. In a study using nested PCR for both hMPV and HBoV, Guido et al.

In our study, the detection limit of the semi-nested PCR targeting the N gene was 6.69 9 10 5 plasmid copies per reaction. Ali et al.
