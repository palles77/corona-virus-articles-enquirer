However, to the best of our knowledge, only four ECoV strains have been isolated in the United States and Japan, and the complete genome sequence of this pathogen is only available for one American strain (NC99) [5] . To improve the molecular diagnosis of ECoV and to better understand its epidemiology, more genomic sequence data are required. Therefore, in this study, we determined the complete genome sequences of the remaining three ECoV strains isolated in Japan and compared them with that of NC99.",

These ECoVs were isolated from adult horses showing symptoms of diarrhea at Obihiro Racecourse, Hokkaido, Japan. Tokachi09, Obihiro12-1 and Obihiro12-2 were passaged 4 to 5 times in HRT-18G cells [2, 3] . Viral RNA was extracted using a MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). RT-PCR was performed with six primer sets designed based on the complete genome sequence of NC99 (GenBank accession number: NC_010327) (Supplementary Table 1 Chip were performed automatically using Ion Chef, and sequencing was conducted in the Ion PGM system according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a result, we obtained more than 140 million nucleotides (nt) for each ECoV, and the average depth was 14859.2 times. The raw signal data were analyzed using Torrent Suite version 4.4.1, and NC99 was used as a reference sequence. The reads with more than 100 bases that could be mapped to the reference sequence were used. Torrent Variant Caller version 4.2 was used to call the mutated sites, and the most frequently observed alleles were selected in each of the called positions. Bases within the reference sequence were substituted with the observed alleles if frequencies exceeded 50 %. The 5'-and 3'-end sequences were determined by Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) using a GeneRacer Kit with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a 3'-Full RACE Core Set (Takara), respectively. The primers used for 5'/3' RACE are shown in Supplementary Table 1. PCR was conducted using HotStarTaq Plus DNA Polymerase (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The amplified products were cloned using a TOPO TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the plasmids were sequenced commercially (Fasmac, Atsugi, Japan) using an M13 universal primer. At least three clones were sequenced per amplified product. Sequences were analyzed and assembled using the Vector NTI Advance 11 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleic acid sequences was conducted using MEGA 5.2 software [6] . Phylogenetic trees based on complete genome sequences were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. Statistical analysis of the trees was conducted using the bootstrap test (1,000 replicates).",
