S2 consisted of 3798 nucleotides with a long ORF encoding a 1116 amino acid long protein (123 kDa). BLAST and phylogenetic analysis showed 29% sequence identity and close relatedness of AmCPV S2 with RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of other insect cypoviruses, suggesting a common origin of all insect cypoviruses. The ORF of S2 was expressed as 123 kDa soluble His-tagged fusion protein in insect cells via baculovirus recombinants which exhibited RdRp activity in an in vitro RNA polymerase assay without any intrinsic terminal transferase activity. Maximum activity was observed at 37\u00b0C at pH 6.0 in the presence of 3 mM MgCl 2. Site directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of the conserved GDD motif. This is the first report of functional characterization of a cypoviral RdRp which may lead to the development of anti-viral agents.",

            "text": "Antheraea mylitta cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (AmCPV) is one of the most widespread pathogens of Indian non-mulberry silkworm, A. mylitta. Almost 20% crop is damaged annually due to this virus attack (Jolly et al., 1974) . A large number of CPV-infected A. myllita larvae develop chronic diarrhea that eventually leads to a condition known as \"Grasserie\" and the death of the larvae (Jolly et al., 1974) . CPV belongs to the genus Cypovirus and family Reoviridae (Mertens et al., 2005; Payne and Mertens, 1983) . CPV infects the midgut of the wide range of insects belonging to the order Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera (Bellonick and Mori, 1998) . Viral infection is often characterized by the production of large number of occlusion body called polyhedra in the cytoplasm of infected cells. CPV genome is composed of 10 double stranded RNA segments (S1-S10) (Payne and Mertens, 1983) , although a small 11 segment (S11) has been reported in some cases such as Trichoplusia ni cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (TnCPV-15) (Rao et al., 2000) and Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (BmCPV) (Arella et al., 1988) . Each dsRNA segment is composed of a plus strand mRNA and its complementary minus strand in an end to end base pair configuration except for a protruding 5\u2032 cap on the plus strand. Among the viruses of the family Reoviridae, complete nucleotide sequences of double stranded RNA genome have been reported for the members of the genera Orthoreovirus, Rotavirus, Orbivirus, Phytoreovirus, Coltivirus, Oryzavirus, Seadornavirus, cypovirus and putative members of Fijivirus (Attoui et al., 2005a,b; Cowled et al., 2009; Duncan, 1999; Estes and Cohen, 1989; Graham et al., 2008; Hagiwara et al., 2001 Hagiwara et al., , 2002 Mertens et al., 2005; Nakashima et al., 1996; Rao et al., 2000; Suzuki, 1995) .",

Sequencing of AmCPV S2 showed that it consisted of 3798 nucleotides with a single long ORF of 3351 nucleotides, which could encode a protein of 1116 amino acids. The ORF in the cDNA started with an ATG codon at nucleotide 30 and terminates in a TGA codon at nucleotide 3380. Twenty-nine nucleotides upstream of the start codon and four hundred and eighteen nucleotides downstream of stop codon were present as untranslated sequences. The molecular mass of the encoded protein was deduced as \u223c123 kDa. BLAST analysis showed that nucleotide sequence of AmCPV S2 was 29% identical with RdRp of CoCPV, LdCPV and BmCPV encoded by their genome segment 2 and allows to conclude that AmCPV S2 could also encode viral RdRp. This is supported by the MotifScan result which showed the presence of characteristic signature motifs for the RdRp of members of the Reoviridae: the conserved GDD motif at positions 681-683 and GKQXGXXXD motif at positions 526-534 (Li et al., 2007) . In addition, comparison of the sequences of AmCPV S2 encoded RdRp with those of poliovirus, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), reovirus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) showed the presence of catalytic motif A (with conserved aspartates separated by four residues), motif B (with conserved \"XSG\" sequence), motif C (with conserved 'XDD\" sequence), motif D (with conserved hydrophilic E and K residue) in the palm sub domain, as well as motif F (with submotifs, F1, F2 and F3 containing conserved positively charged, basic residues K or R) in the finger sub domain (Fig. 1) . It also contained motif E (with hydrophobic residues) positioned between the palm and thumb subdomains and motif G (with conserved \"SXG\" sequences) to form loop and alpha-helix structure (Candress et al., 1990; Poch et al., 1989; Xu et al., 2003; O'Reilly and Kao, 1998) .",

Analysis of sonicated bacterial pellet (in PBS) and supernatant by SDS-PAGE showed expression of AmCPV S2 encoded protein in E. coli as insoluble form (data not shown) and may be due to improper folding of expressed protein in bacteria. Bacteria were then lysed in buffer containing 8 M urea to solubilize expressed insoluble protein, and purified through Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Analysis of this protein by SDS-8% PAGE (Fig. 3A) showed a 123 kDa protein band. Polyclonal antibody was raised in a rabbit against this purified protein, affinity purified and the final concentration was determined as 1.5 mg/ml. The titer of purified antibody was determined by ELISA as 10,000 using 2.5 \u00b5g of antigen, and used for immunoblot analysis. Since E. coli produced this protein as insoluble inclusion bodies, wild type recombinant and mutant AmCPV S2 encoded proteins were expressed in soluble form as His-tagged fusion protein in Sf 9 cells via baculovirus expression system and purified through Ni-NTA chromatography. The production of wild type recombinant and mutant (GDD-GAD and GDD-GAA) proteins as 123 kDa band was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using raised polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3B ). This indicates that due to proper folding of expressed protein inside the insect cells, soluble protein have been produced and to our knowledge this is the first report of the production of any cypoviral RdRp in soluble form.",

We chose these minigenome's templates based on the assumption that the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs would contain the cis acting signals necessary for the initiation of minus strand RNA synthesis. As shown in Fig. 6B , 32 P labeled RNA products with a size similar to that of RNA substrate were obtained in reactions containing 3\u2032 positive and 3\u2032 negative strand RNA transcripts as template (lanes 1 and 3) but not in the reaction containing 5\u2032 positive strand RNA fragment as template when no primer was used (lane 2). These results indicate that AmCPV RdRp can synthesize RNA de novo utilizing AmCPV S2 subgenomic RNA as template like those of other RNA viruses (Casey et al., 1986; Zhong et al., 1998) and without the help of any other viral proteins as observed in BTV VP1 protein (Boyce et al., 2004) . The preference of 3' positive and 3' negative strand may depend on the specific recognition of RdRp of the special structure of RNA substrate for the initiation of RNA synthesis in a primer dependent manner. The importance of the 3' untranslated region of RNA in the initiation of replication process has been demonstrated in several viruses including bamboo mosaic virus (Li et al., 1998) , turnip crinkle virus (Rajendran et al., 2002) , picorna virus (Kok and McMinn, 2009 ) and rotavirus (Chen et al., 2001) .",

No products were observed in the absence of enzyme (lane 5) or RNA template (lane 4) or when double stranded RNA (AmCPV S11) was used as template (lane 7).

Genomic RNA was isolated from the purified Polyhedra following a standard guanidium isothiocyanate method (Ausubel et al., 1995) .

To understand the divalent cation requirement of the enzyme, the reaction was also carried out at different concentrations of Mg ++ and Mn ++ . Similarly, in order to determine optimum salt concentration, assay was performed with different concentration of KCl and NaCl. RdRp assay was also performed with in vitro transcribed AmCPV S2 subgenomic RNA (single stranded) (1 \u00b5g) or AmCPV S11 dsRNA (1 \u00b5g) as templates without any primer in presence of 0.4 \u00b5M AmCPV RdRp in the same manner as described above for Poly (A) template/ Oligo U (18) primer in presence of 1 mM each of NTPs (Ambion) and 4 \u00b5Ci of [\u03b1 32 P] UTP. To determine the primer-dependent initiation of RNA synthesis, the in vitro transcribed subgenomic 5' positive strand of S2 RNA was used as template in RdRp reaction with primer which can bind specifically to that strand. Reaction products were then separated in formaldehyde agarose gel and exposed to X ray film. The intensity of band (density) was determined by scanning the autoradiogram in KODAK 1D image analysis software (Kodak, EDAS 290).",
