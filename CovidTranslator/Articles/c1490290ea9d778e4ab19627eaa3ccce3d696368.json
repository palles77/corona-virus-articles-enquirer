            "text": "Neisseria meningitidis is a cause of meningitis epidemics worldwide and of rapidly progressing fatal septic shock. A crucial step in the pathogenesis of invasive meningococcal infections is the adhesion of bloodborne meningococci to both peripheral and brain endothelia, leading to major vascular dysfunction. Initial adhesion of pathogenic strains to endothelial cells relies on meningococcal type IV pili, but the endothelial receptor for bacterial adhesion remains unknown. Here, we report that the immunoglobulin superfamily member CD147 (also called extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) or Basigin) is a critical host receptor for the meningococcal pilus components PilE and PilV. Interfering with this interaction potently inhibited the primary attachment of meningococci to human endothelial cells in vitro and prevented colonization of vessels in human brain tissue explants ex vivo and in humanized mice in vivo. These findings establish the molecular events by which meningococci target human endothelia, and they open new perspectives for treatment and prevention of meningococcus-induced vascular dysfunctions. npg",

Pathology is initiated when meningococci gain access to the bloodstream, multiply in the blood and disseminate into various tissues, causing meningitis or purpura fulminans, the most severe form of meningococcal invasive disease. Despite antimicrobial therapy, systemic meningococcal infections remain a major cause of mortality and severe neurological sequelae [2] [3] [4] . The endothelium lining blood and lymphatic vessels is a key barrier separating circulating body fluids from host tissues and is a major target for several pathogenic bacteria 5 . A crucial step in the pathophysiology of invasive bloodborne meningococci is their adhesion to and proliferation in both peripheral and brain blood microvessels, a process referred to as vascular colonization 6 . This intimate interaction of meningococci with endothelial cells leads to deregulated inflammatory and coagulation processes, endothelial dysfunction and, ultimately, the breach of endothelial barriers and bacterial dissemination into perivascular tissues 4 . Deciphering the mechanisms that govern this initial pathophysiological step of invasive meningococcal diseases represents an essential development toward the design of new therapeutic approaches to control bacterial infection and subsequent vascular and tissue damage. The capacity of pathogenic capsulated meningococci to interact tightly with human endothelial cells relies on the expression of type IV pili 3, 5 . However, the host cell adhesion receptor that mediates the bacterial attachment to human vessels has remained unknown.",

They mediate adhesion to endothelial cells and signaling events that eventually lead to bacterial translocation through endothelia [7] [8] [9] [10] . These structures are heteromultimeric assemblies of pilin subunits that form helical fibers 11 . The major pilin subunit, PilE, constitutes the essential fiber scaffold and is subject to antigenic variation. Other less abundant ('minor') pilins, such as PilV, PilX and ComP, structurally resemble PilE and participate in various pilus-related functions such as adhesion, bacterial aggregation and DNA uptake, respectively [12] [13] [14] . Both PilE and PilV have been shown to be involved in adhesion to host cells 9, [15] [16] [17] [18] . Furthermore, these two pilins were recently reported to activate the G protein-coupled \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptor (\u03b2 2 -AR), which promotes the endothelial signaling events that are subsequent to bacterial adhesion 9, 19 . However, \u03b2 2 -AR-depleted endothelial cells, although unable to promote signaling events, still support pilus-mediated bacterial adhesion, thus indicating that the primary meningococcal attachment requires another, yet unidentified, host receptor for type IV pili.",

Treatment of BB19 cells with phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent transcriptional regulator, induced enhanced adhesion of the meningococcus strain Nm2C4.3 (Supplementary Fig. 1a) . Treatment with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D blocked the TPA effect, suggesting the regulated expression of a putative receptor by TPA at the transcriptional level (Supplementary Fig. 1a) . As expected for type IV pilusmediated adhesion, a nonpiliated meningococcal PilE-null mutant (\u2206pilE) failed to adhere to TPA-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 1b) . In order to identify upregulated genes in permissive cells, we used a differential, quantitative, large-scale analysis of gene expression (Online Methods) that showed 211 genes upregulated by TPA among 10,478 analyzed genes. Six of them encoded membrane-associated proteins (Supplementary Table 1 ). Among those, four proteins had either limited tissue distribution (sialic acid-binding Ig-type lectin 4 (siglec 4), siglec 11 and delta-and Notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor were located mainly in the brain) or limited surface exposure (phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein). Therefore, we instead focused on the type 1 plasma membrane protein CD147, a member of the Ig superfamily 20 and a well-established marker of brain capillaries 21, 22 , and CD59, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein known to inhibit membrane attack complex formation in the complement cascade and to induce signaling events 23 . We confirmed that TPA treatment of BB19 cells upregulated expression of CD147 and CD59 ( Supplementary  Fig. 1c) . CD147 expression was enriched at sites of meningococcal adhesion, whereas CD59 was not (Supplementary Fig. 1d) .",

We therefore performed adhesion experiments using meningococcal strains belonging to different capsular serogroups (Z5463, serogroup A; MC58, serogroup B; FAM20, serogroup C; and ROU, serogroup W135) (Fig. 2e) , as well as derivatives of Nm2C4.3 (serogroup C) displaying different variants of the major pilin subunit PilE, designated PilE SA and PilE SB (Fig. 2f) . Reduction of CD147 expression affected the adhesion of these different strains and variants similarly, demonstrating that the capacity of CD147 to support type IV pilus-dependent adhesion was independent of capsular antigen and of antigenic variation of PilE. Competition experiments with CD147-Fc, a soluble recombinant chimeric molecule containing the extracellular domain of CD147 fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1, showed that CD147-Fc caused a 50% reduction in bacterial adhesion to HBMEC cells, whereas soluble ICAM-1-Fc had no effect (Fig. 2g) . To confirm that the extracellular portion of CD147 is a binding site for meningococci, we assayed two antibodies specific for CD147, MEM-M6/1 and MEM-M6/6, which respectively bind to the extracellular N-terminal and the C-terminal Ig domains of CD147, as interaction inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. 5a ). Both antibodies labeled noninfected hCMEC/D3 cells similarly (Supplementary Fig. 5b) , but only MEM-M6/1 efficiently labeled CD147 molecules recruited to bacterial adhesion sites, suggesting that the MEM-M6/6 antibody and meningococci compete for the same binding site in the C-terminal Ig domain of CD147 ( Supplementary  Fig. 5c) . Accordingly, preincubation of hCMEC/D3 cells or HBMECs with the MEM-M6/6 antibody before infection inhibited the initial attachment of Nm2C4.3 under shear stress by 55% and 75%, respectively, whereas the MEM-M6/1 antibody reduced the initial attachment by only 25% and 20% (Fig. 2h) . Overall, our data indicate that CD147 is a critical receptor for the primary attachment of piliated meningococci to both peripheral and brain human endothelial cells.",

First, purified PilE SB or PilV recombinant pilins immobilized on inactivated staphylococci could selectively pull down soluble CD147-Fc (Fig. 3c) . Second, in a protein-protein interaction assay based on oxygen singlet transfer (AlphaScreen), we detected a dose-dependent association with CD147-Fc for both PilE SB and PilV, but not for the other minor pilins (Fig. 3d,e) . This interaction was independent of antigenic variation in the PilE subunit (Supplementary Fig. 6a) and was specific to CD147 (Supplementary Fig. 6b ). As observed above for meningococcal adhesion to human endothelial cells, these interactions were inhibited by the MEM-M6/6 antibody but not by the control anti-ICAM-1 antibody (11C81) (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 6c) . npg Third, using surface plasmon resonance, we found a specific interaction of PilE SB -or PilV-coated staphylococci with immobilized CD147 (Supplementary Fig. 7) , but we observed no interaction when we used monomeric pilins (data not shown). These results indicate that, despite relatively low affinities of PilE SB and PilV monomers for CD147, their clustering on staphylococci can provide sufficient avidity to CD147, which is consistent with the multimeric organization of pilins within pilus fibers. We then quantified the interaction of PilE variants or PilV with CD147 by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3g) . We observed a load-dependent correlation for the interaction forces of PilE variants or PilV with CD147, further confirming the specificity of this interaction (data not shown). Measured interaction forces with CD147 (62 \u00b1 15 pN, 58 \u00b1 16 pN and 49 \u00b1 12 pN, for PilE SA , PilE SB and PilV, respectively) were only about twofold lower than that between CD147 and its established ligand cyclophilin 31 (128 \u00b1 35 pN) . These data, consistent with a previously described role for PilE and PilV in Neisseria species pilus-mediated adhesion to host cells 9,15-18 , confirm the direct participation of PilE and PilV in the selective interaction of meningococci with CD147.",

Although limited to dermal vessels, this model constitutes a unique tool to study meningococcal interaction with human endothelial cells under realistic conditions in a live host. As previously shown 32 , 18 h after bacterial challenge, the Nm2C4.3 wild-type strain massively colonized the human dermal vasculature in a type IV pilus-dependent manner, as we observed no colonization with the nonpiliated \u2206pilE derivative (Fig. 4b,c) . Consistent with our in vitro observation, the meningococcal \u2206pilV derivative did not associate with vessels in the grafted human skin (Fig. 4b,c) , whereas both \u2206pilE and \u2206pilV complemented strains colonized human vessels with an efficiency correlating to the expression level of the complemented proteins (Supplementary Fig. 8d-f) .

Meningococci incubated with tissue sections established specific tight association with brain vessels, predominantly in Virchow-Robin spaces and in cortical regions ( Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 9) , reminiscent of neuropathological findings in patients with meningococcal meningitis 28, 34 . Adhesion relied on the expression of both PilE and PilV, as \u2206pilE or \u2206pilV mutants adhered poorly (Fig. 5b-d and Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Upon infection, wild-type meningococci developed microcolonies immediately adjacent to CD147-positive endothelial cells (Fig. 6a) . We also found meningococci in the vicinity of CD147-positive leptomeningeal cells and of cortical brain vessels ( Supplementary  Fig. 10a,b) , but they were not associated with glial or neuronal cells that do not express CD147 (Supplementary Fig. 10c) , indicating a close correlation between meningococcal adhesion to fresh human brain tissue and CD147 expression. Consistent with in vitro cellular models, pretreatment of brain sections with the MEM-M6/6 antibody substantially reduced adhesion of meningococci to human brain vessels, whereas the MEM-M6/1 antibody or the control 11C81 anti-ICAM-1 antibody had no effect (Fig. 6b,c) .

            "text": "This study demonstrates that the specific interaction between the meningococcal ligands PilE and PilV and the cellular host receptor CD147 is essential for meningococcal adhesion to human endothelial cells and colonization of human blood vessels, a prerequisite to the major vascular alterations that are the hallmark of invasive meningococcal infections. These results, which help unravel the molecular basis of a key pathophysiological step of meningococcal diseases, are consistent with previous reports suggesting that, in addition to its structural role in the pilus scaffold, the PilE subunit plays a direct role in bacterial adhesion to host cells 15 . PilV has also previously been shown to be required for the adhesion of the closely related Neisseria gonorrhoeae 18 . Interaction with CD147 occurs independently of antigenic variation in the PilE subunit and of possible post-translational modifications. PilE and PilV have relatively low affinities for CD147, whereas multimeric pilins efficiently bind to CD147, indicating a system where avidity is crucial, consistent with the natural organization of pilins in multimeric complexes within pilus fibers. Because endothelial cells, and more particularly brain microvessels, express high levels of CD147, it is likely that CD147 expression level may also contribute to avidity, compensating for the weak affinity of the CD147-meningococcal pilins interaction. How these two pilus components act in concert to create the adhesive phenotype remains to be solved. Identification of the precise PilE and PilV epitopes required for interaction with CD147 will allow the development of targeted antibodies that could prevent type IV pilus-CD147 interaction, opening the path to new vaccine strategies against meningococcal infection.",

            "text": "CD147 is expressed on different cell types, such as erythrocytes and epithelial cells. Pilus-dependent interactions between meningococci and erythrocytes, causing hemagglutination, have been documented in vitro 35, 36 , and meningococci have been described crossing polarized epithelia, indicating that meningococcus might interact with CD147 in a variety of cell types. Notably, several viruses, including HIV-1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 37 and measles virus 38 , as well as the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes 39 , also target CD147 to adhere to and/or invade epithelial cells, indicating that CD147 constitutes an evolutionarily conserved efficient target for pathogens to infect tissues and spread within organisms. CD147 is also known as EMMPRIN, a master regulator of the production of matrix metalloproteinase 40 . It is therefore likely that, in addition to its role in pathogen adhesion and invasion processes, CD147 also contributes to the disruption of the epithelial and endothelial barrier integrity by promoting local production of matrix metalloproteinases.",

Notably, a similar functional association of these two receptors has been reported in the context of erythrocyte infection by the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the agent of malaria, although the mechanism of this association is still unknown 41, 42 . The implication of these two receptors in different tissues and in the context of different infectious diseases might reflect a preexisting functional connection between CD147 and \u03b2 2 -AR that is hijacked by different pathogens to disseminate and induce multiple organ failure. npg Taken together, our data highlight a key role for CD147 in the cascade of pathophysiological events following meningococcal entry into the bloodstream. Agents or vaccines preventing type IV pilus interaction with CD147 might therefore be highly effective for treatment or prevention of meningococcal infection and associated vascular dysfunction.",

Nm2C4.3 (formerly clone 12) is a piliated capsulated Opa -Opcvariant of the serogroup C meningococcal clinical isolate 8013 (ref. 43) cultured as described previously 44 . Nm2C4.3 expressing pilin variants PilE SA , PilE SB or GFP were previously described 28, 43 . The pilV mutant was engineered by introduction of an aph3\u2032 resistance cassette into the pilV gene. To complement the pilV mutant, the pilV allele was amplified using primers PilV forward 5\u2032-CCT TAATTAAGGAGTAATTTTATGATGAGTAATAAAATGGAACA-3\u2032 and PilV reverse 5\u2032-CCTTAATTAACTATTTTTTACGATTAGAGAAAGC-3\u2032, containing overhangs with restriction sites for PacI. This PCR fragment was restricted with PacI and cloned into PacI-restricted pGCC4 vector as described before 12 . This placed pilV under the transcriptional control of an IPTG inducible promoter within a DNA fragment corresponding to an intragenic region of the meningococcal chromosome. This pilV construct was then introduced into the chromosome of the \u2206pilV mutant by homologous recombination. A similar scheme was used for the construction of a complemented PilE isogenic meningococcus strain. The orf of the pilE gene was inserted, in E. coli, at the PacI restriction site of the PGCC4 plasmid. The primers used to amplify PilE were PilE forward 5\u2032-CTTAATTAAGGAGTAATTTATGAACACCCTTCAAAAAGGTTTTAC-3\u2032 and PilE reverse 5\u2032-CTTAATTAATTAGCTGGCAGATGAATCATCGCG-3\u2032. The inducible pilE construct was inserted ectopically into the chromosome of the Nm2C4.3 strain through transformation, using erythromycin for selection. The wild-type pilE locus was subsequently inactivated through transformation of chromosomal DNA of a previously described aphA3-insertionally inactivated endogenous \u2206pilE derivative and selected with kanamycin 17 . Virtually no PilE could be detected in the absence of induction in the resulting \u2206pilE/pilE strain, whereas induction yielded up to approximately 5% of the wild-type expression level of PilE, as PilE is one of the most strongly constitutively expressed meningococcal proteins. Phenotypically, despite the low level of PilE complementation induced upon IPTG treatment, the functionality of type IV pili expressed upon PilE complementation was ascertained through restoration of competence (competence frequency <1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 per \u00b5g DNA for \u2206pilE, \u2206pilE/ pilE and wild-type strains, respectively Cell lines. hCMEC/D3 is a fully differentiated human brain endothelial cell line derived from brain capillaries, produced in the laboratory and which recapitulates the major phenotypic features of the blood-brain barrier 24 .

The AlphaScreen technology was used to assess the interaction between MBP-pilin recombinant fusion proteins and CD147-Fc-His or ALCAM-1-Fc-His as a control. The binding reaction was performed using white 384-well Optiplates (PerkinElmer, Whalham, MA, USA) in 20 \u00b5l (total reaction volume). The AlphaScreen reagents (anti-MBP-coated Acceptor beads and Nickel chelate-coated Donor beads) were obtained from PerkinElmer. CD147-Fc-His (or ALCAM-1-Fc-His) and MBP-pilins were prepared in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mM NaCl. Donor beads (20 \u00b5g/ml) were incubated with CD147-His (0, 100 or 500 nM) for 45 min at room temperature. In parallel, acceptor beads (20 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) were incubated with MBP-pilins (0, 50 or 500 nM) for 1 h at room temperature in the AlphaScreen reaction buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.4 at 20 \u00b0C, 20 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20). Next, 10 \u00b5l of each of the interacting partners were added to the plate, allowed to incubate for either 2 h or overnight in the dark and at room temperature. In antibody competition assays, 5 \u00b5l of MEM-M-6/6 or 11C81 antibodies (at variable concentrations) were added to CD147-Fc-His-Donor beads for 30 min at room temperature before incubation with the MBP-pilin-Acceptor beads. Light signal was detected with the EnVision multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer).Surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were carried out on a Biacore 3000 SPR biosensor (Biacore InternationalAB). CD147-Fc or control ICAM-1-Fc chimera (10 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) were immobilized onto CM5 chip surfaces at 10 \u00b5l min \u22121 using a standard amine coupling protocol with EDC (1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide)/NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) following the manufacturer's instructions. The density was controlled at an increased response level of 4,600 and 7,200 response units (RU) for ICAM-1-Fc and CD147-Fc, respectively. Soluble monomeric pilins diluted at various concentrations (0.15 to 10 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 4 mM EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) P20 surfactant or 70 \u00b5l of a suspension of pilin-coated staphylococci in PBS pH 7.4 were used as analytes. Analytes were applied at a flow rate of 10 \u00b5l min \u22121 for 5 min followed by a dissociation time of 6 min. Regeneration of the sensorchip surface was performed with 2.5 M NaCl in PBS at 100 \u00b5l min \u22121 for 5 min followed by two washes at 100 \u00b5l min \u22121 with PBS. Output sensorgrams were analyzed using BIAcore BIAnalysis software.Atomic force microscopy. Force spectroscopy was performed between pilins and a CD147-functionalized surface. CD147-Fc-His or control ALCAM-1-Fc-His chimera were deposited on a glass surface using a nitrilotriacetic acid that ensured covalent and oriented binding with the protein 54 . MBP-pilins and control proteins (MBP, cyclophilin) were coated on AFM tips using established protocol known to keep protein functionality intact as previously published 55, 56 . All the experiments were performed at room temperature on a commercial AFM (MultiMode8, Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) driven under Nanoscope 8.15. MBP-pilins were used at 100 \u00b5g ml \u22121 . Bruker DNP cantilevers with a nominal spring constant of 0.06 N/m and a nominal tip radius of 20 nm were used. True cantilever spring constant was determined using Bruker's thermal tune calibration tool. Experiments were done in force-volume mode operating in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.0). Pulling speed was set to 10 \u00b5m s \u22121 on 4 \u00b5m 2 areas, 300 nm z ramp, with a relative trigger of 150 pN on the cantilever deflection and a contact time of 200 ms. 6,144 force curves per condition were recorded, using at least 6 different tips. Most nonspecific tip-surface adhesion events were automatically discarded from analysis. Force-distance curves were analyzed as previously described 55 , and binding-unbinding events on the retraction curve were detected according to their shape and size characteristics by a fuzzy logic algorithm fully described in (ref. 57) . Briefly, we considered unbinding events based on the vertical segment size, the V-shape and the angle with the baseline. Statistical analysis was performed using R2.15 where provided data are the peak position mean values \u00b1 s.d.Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. hCMEC/D3, BB19 or HBMEC cells were grown to confluence on Permanox coverslips (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or on Transwell filters (Costar). After the indicated treatments and/or infection, cells were fixed and labeled as previously described 44, 52 . Anti-ezrin antibody (1/1,000), anti-CD44 (1/25) anti-CD147 (MEM-M6/1, 1/100), anti-CD59 (1/100) and rabbit polyclonal serum anti-Nm2C4.3 strain (1/3,000) were used as primary antibodies, and DAPI (0.5 mg ml \u22121 ) was added to Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1/300). Image acquisition and analysis were performed with a DMI6000 microscope (Leica, 63\u00d7). Series of optical sections were obtained with a confocal spinning disk microscope (Leica, 63\u00d7). Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions were obtained using Imaris software and quantification histograms with ImageJ software (NIH). Quantitative analysis of protein recruitment under bacterial colonies was determined as the proportion of colonies positive for the protein of interest indicated. At least 50 colonies were observed per coverslip. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times in duplicate or triplicate.Infection of severe combined immunodeficiency mice grafted with human skin. Six-week-old CB17/Icr-Prkdc scid /IcrIcoCrl SCID female mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Saint Germain sur l' Arbresle, France). Human skin tissues were obtained from adult patients undergoing plastic surgery in the Service de Chirurchie Plastique et Reconstructive of the Groupe Hospitalier Saint-Joseph (Paris, France). In accordance with the French legislation, patients were informed and did not refuse to participate in the study. Experimental procedures were performed as previously described 32 , in accordance with the guidelines of the Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale. The use of human tissue and the experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes (consent form CEEA34.O.J.L.039.12). Briefly, mice were prepared for transplantation by shaving the hair of the back and abdominal areas after they received an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine 100 mg kg \u22121 and xylazine 10 mg kg \u22121 . A skin flap was created, and a full-thickness human skin graft was placed onto the wound bed. The transplants were held in place with 6-0 nonabsorbable monofilament suture materials, and the flap was then sutured above the transplant. Grafted mice were used for meningococcal infection experiments 1 month after human skin transplantation. Meningococcus strains were grown overnight at 37 \u00b0C on GCB agar plates prepared without iron and supplemented with 15 \u00b5M deferoxamine (Desferal, Novartis) with appropriate antibiotic. Bacterial colonies were harvested and cultured in RPMI with 1% bovine serum albumin medium and 0.06 \u00b5M deferoxamine with gentle agitation to reach the exponential phase of growth. Bacteria were then resuspended in physiological saline containing 20 mg ml \u22121 of human holotransferrin to promote bacterial growth in vivo (2914HT, R&D systems). Mice were infected intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml of this bacterial suspension to minimize the inoculum required to obtain a reproducible high bacteremia in grafted mice. To assess bacteremia in infected animals, 10 \u00b5l of blood was sampled using a heparinized hematocrit glass tube 1 h after injection by puncture in the lateral tail vein, or 18 h after injection by intracardiac puncture on animal killed by intraperitoneal injection of a lethal dose of ketamine and xylazine. Bacterial counts were performed by plating serial dilutions of blood on GCB agar plates. Results were expressed in colony-forming units (CFU) per ml of blood. Biopsy of human skin grafts were carefully collected using a dermatological punch biopsy system and fixed overnight at 4 \u00b0C in paraformaldehyde 1%, lysin 75 mM and sodium periodate 100 mM in phosphate buffer. After they were washed in phosphate buffer, the specimens were dehydrated in successive sucrose gradient solutions (10%, 20%, 30% prepared in phosphate buffer 0.1 M) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C each, embedded in OCT and then frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. 7-\u00b5m thick sections of the dermis were immobilized on Superfrost plus microscope slides and analyzed via immunofluorescence. Sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies for 2 h in PBS/BSA 0.1%: monoclonal anti-human collagen IV (1/100) and a rabbit polyclonal serum against the Nm2C4.3 strain (1:3,000). DAPI (0.5 mg ml \u22121 ) was added to Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1/300) for 1 h. After additional washing, coverslips were mounted in glycergel (Dako). 3 sections per graft were analyzed using epifluorescence (Zeiss Axiovert, 20\u00d7). Quantification analysis of the images (n > 10 per graft) was performed using ImageJ software (NIH). Results are presented as a vascular colonization index corresponding to the area occupied by the fluorescently labeled bacteria in relation to the human vessel area delineated by the anticollagen IV staining \u00d7100, from 6 independent grafts per condition. npg Infection of human brain tissues. Fresh human brain sections were obtained from frontal lobe specimens of macroscopically and histologically normal brain (confirmed by a neuropathologist) of individuals referred to the Department of Forensic Medicine for unexplained out-of-hospital sudden death (consent forms ML1094, PFS 10-008, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00320099 approved by The Institutional Review Board of the Poincar\u00e9 Hospital, Versailles-Saint Quentin University and the Agence de la Biom\u00e9decine). After freezing of the brain tissue with isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen, the 7-\u00b5m-thick sections containing leptomeninges, cortical ribbon and the underlying white matter were immobilized on Superfrost plus microscope slides and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Defrosted sections were rehydrated in PBS for 5 min and incubated for 1 h with medium containing 0.1% BSA before infection with suspensions of bacteria (2 \u00d7 10 7 in 150 \u00b5l of medium containing 0.1% BSA) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Sections were then gently washed horizontally 5 times and fixed in PAF 4% for 10 min at room temperature. When indicated, sections were treated for 1 h with 10 \u00b5g ml \u22121 of antibodies targeting CD147 or ICAM-1 and then washed 3 times before infection by bacteria. Adherent meningococci were detected by chromogenic immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis. To perform chromogenic immunohistochemistry, after tissue rehydration, sections were incubated overnight with the indicated primary antibodies (monoclonal anti-human CD147 (MEM-M6/1, 1/100) and a rabbit polyclonal serum anti-Nm2C4.3 strain (1/3,000)) and revealed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody and an alkaline phosphatase donkey anti-rabbit (1/500). DAB (brown color) and NBT/BCIP (blue color) were used as chromogens. For immunofluorescence analysis, brain sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies for 2 h in PBS/BSA 0.1%: monoclonal anti-human CD147 (MEM-M6/1, 1/100), anti-GFAP (1/100), anti-human vimentin (1/100) and a rabbit polyclonal serum anti-Nm2C4.3 strain (1/3,000). Alexa Fluor-conjugated phalloidin (1/300) and DAPI (0.5 mg ml \u22121 ) were added to Alexa Fluorconjugated secondary antibodies (1/300) for 1 h. After additional washing, coverslips were mounted in glycergel (Dako). Entire samples were scanned using Nanozoomer 2.0 (Hamamatsu) and were further analyzed using optical microscopy, epifluorescence (Zeiss Axiovert, 40\u00d7) and confocal (spinning disk Leica, 63\u00d7) microscopy. Quantification analysis of the fluorescently labeled bacteria that adhered on a 1 mm 2 surface area was performed using ImageJ software. Results are presented as a mean of fluorescence per 100 \u00b5m 2 , from two independent experiments. 3D reconstructions were performed on deconvoluted confocal stacks using Imaris software.Statistical analyses. All values are expressed as the mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Statistical differences were determined to be significant at P < 0.05. The specific tests used are described in the figure legends. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. The experiments were not randomized.",
