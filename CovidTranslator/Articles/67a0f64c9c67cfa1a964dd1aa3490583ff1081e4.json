            "text": "Calf diarrhoea causes substantial economic losses in cattle herds worldwide. Neonatal calves are particularly sensitive to infections with enteropathogens. The present study focused on prevention against the main infectious causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea i.e. Escherichia coli, rota-and coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium parvum. Dairy herds (n = 24) with a high percentage of neonatal calves scouring (>10%) were included and calves were sampled for the presence of these four enteropathogens. To decrease diarrhoea problems among neonatal calves, a standard protocol was tested on 13 herds (treatment group) where both C. parvum and either E. coli or rota-or coronavirus were identified as being involved, the other 11 herds served as control group. The protocol consisted of 2 points of action: preventive vaccination of dams against E. coli, rota-and coronavirus, and preventive administration of halofuginone lactate to newborn calves. The average percentage of calves suffering from neonatal diarrhoea (39.7% versus 14.3%, P < 0.01) and the average percentage of faecal samples positive for C. parvum (34% versus 11%, P < 0.05) differed significantly between control herds and treatment herds after implementation of the protocol. No significant differences between control and treatment group were observed in the percentage of calves excreting E. coli, rotavirus and coronavirus, both before and at the end of the trial. Furthermore, risk factors potentially associated with the development of neonatal calf scours were determined. Non-significant results were obtained for the effect of the protocol on duration of diarrhoea and the effect of the colostral IgG quantity on the risk of diarrhoea. Passive immunity transfer status of the calves, measured both before the onset and at the end of the study, were non-significant between groups.",

This ELISA kit detects Cryptosporidium spp., but as data worldwide show that C. parvum is the most common species found in calves of this age (Geurden et al., 2007; Langkjaer et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2007) , we presumed the species to be C. parvum. Also, on each of these herds, both before and at the end of the study, blood samples of 5 randomly selected calves between 2 and 5 days old were collected for the determination of the serum IgG concentration using a commercial radial immunodiffusion kit (Bovine IgG Test Kit, Triple J Farms, Bellingham, USA).

To evaluate the variance occurring at the herd level, null models were fit with herd as random effect for all dependent variables. (1) Risk factor analysis. To identify herd level risk factors associated with the likelihood of diarrhoea within the first 14 days after birth, a logistic regression model was fit (Table 2) . Initially, univariable associations were tested between the binary dependent variable 'occurrence of diarrhoea' at the calf level (0 = no; 1 = yes) and all categorical independent variables at the herd level presented in Table 1 . Statistical significance in this step was assessed at P < 0.20. Secondly, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated among the significant independent variables to check for multicollinearity. If two independent variables had a correlation coefficient \u22650.6, only one was selected for further analysis. Contact between weaned and non-weaned calves and cleaning and disinfecting of the calf box after each calf were correlated, as were milk type and temperature control of milk given. Cleaning and disinfecting of the calf box after each calf and type of milk were selected because these are the biologically most relevant factors. In the third step, a multivariable model was fit using a stepwise backward procedure. A variable was considered to act as a confounder if its removal made the regression coefficients of the remaining variables undergo a relative change >25% or in case the regression coefficient ranged between \u22120.4 and 0.4, if an absolute change >0.1 was observed (Noordhuizen et al., 2001) . Statistical significance in this step was assessed at P < 0.05. (2) Protocol efficacy. First, to determine the association between the treatment groups (control or treatment) and the likelihood of diarrhoea within the first 14 days after birth at the calf level and mortality within the first 14 days after birth while having diarrhoea at the calf level, respectively, logistic mixed regression models with herd as random effect were fit ( Table 2 ). The association between groups (control or treated) and the duration of diarrhoea at the calf level was determined using survival analysis. Calves that died while having diarrhoea were censored. A survival model was fit with herd as shared frailty effect to correct for clustering of calves within herds, and group as categorical fixed effect (Table 2) .",

The higher colostral quality on the treated herds might reflect the success of the vaccination protocol. However, despite the use of a specific vaccine against E. coli, rota-and coronavirus, no significant differences existed between groups in the occurrence of E. coli and rotavirus. As the tetrakit used to determine pathogen excretion is not a quantitative but rather a qualitative to semi-quantitative test, the exact level of pathogen excretion per calf could not be assessed. Hence, we may state that fewer calves excreted enteropathogens following the implementation of the 2 step protocol, but not whether individual excretion was lowered. If so, this potentially also may contribute to fewer calves scouring. Also, calves born from vaccinated dams are significantly less likely to shed C. parvum (Trotz-Williams et al., 2007) .",

McGuirk and Collins (2004) set the alarm level for FPT 10 to be a herd problem at 20%, whilst Chigerwe et al. (2009) consider an FPT prevalence <10% as a rational and achievable goal. Despite the adequate passive immunity in this study, several calves developed diarrhoea which may suggest that the cut off value of 10 g IgG/L is too low, and should be revised (G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al., 2004; Chigerwe et al., 2008; Windeyer et al., 2014) .
