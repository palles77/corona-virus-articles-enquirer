Currently, the United States implements telemedicine services, such as remote consultation and individual psychotherapy, with Medicare and Medicaid, and insurance benefits are provided for the elderly aged 65 years and over. Telemedicine thus carries the same responsibilities as face-to-face medical care.",

Furthermore, the number of nurses was 5.6, which is significantly lower than the OECD average of 9.1 [8] . In addition, due to the geographical concentration of medical facilities, primary medical facilities focusing on accessibility are also concentrated in areas with high population density. Therefore, several areas, such as mountainous areas and islands, continue to lack sufficient medical facilities. This proves the need for telemedicine systems focusing on public healthcare. The current pilot project is limited to health consultations. Therefore, the expansion of service content that meets the needs of the domestic situation is necessary.",

Furthermore, current projects organized by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which account for a large proportion of the budget, such as antismoking campaigns, nutrition education, and education on adult disease prevention [10] , are areas that have the highest influence on the prevalence of illnesses and on public health; therefore, preferential applications of telemedicine should be considered.",

To solve such problems, many domestic and American studies and organizations have proposed the 'shared care model' in which cancer specialists and primary care doctors take care of cancer patients together by sharing information about the patient [12] . However, communication between cancer specialists of tertiary care medical facilities and doctors at the primary and secondary hospitals is not easy to establish due to geographical and institutional problems.
