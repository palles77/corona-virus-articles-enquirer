            "text": "ADVANCES: During the past 50 years, the study of infectious disease dynamics has matured into a rich interdisciplinary field at the intersection of mathematics, epidemiology, ecology, evolutionary biology, immunology, sociology, and public health. The practical challenges range from establishing appropriate data collection to managing increasingly large volumes of information. The theoretical challenges require fundamental study of many-layered, non-linear systems in which infections evolve and spread and where key events can be governed by unpredictable pathogen biology or human behavior. In this Review, we start with an examination of real-time outbreak response using the West African Ebola epidemic as an example. Here, the challenges range from underreporting of cases and deaths, and missing information on the impact of control measures to understanding human responses. The possibility of future zoonoses tests our ability to detect anomalous outbreaks and to estimate human-to-human transmissibility against a backdrop of ongoing zoonotic spillover while also assessing the risk of more dangerous strains evolving. Increased understanding of the dynamics of infections in food webs and ecosystems where host and nonhost species interact is key. Simultaneous multispecies infections are increasingly recognized as a notable public health burden, yet our understanding of how different species of pathogens interact within hosts is rudimentary. Pathogen genomics has become an essential tool for drawing inferences about evolution and transmission and, here but also in general, heterogeneity is the major challenge. Methods that depart from simplistic assumptions about random mixing are yielding new insights into the dynamics of transmission and control. There is rapid growth in estimation of model parameters from mismatched or incomplete data, and in contrasting model output with realworld observations. New data streams on social connectivity and behavior are being used, and combining data collected from very different sources and scales presents important challenges.",

In recent decades, however, it has become clear that the threat from serious infectious diseases will persist, and human mortality attributed to infection is projected to remain at current levels of 13 to 15 million deaths annually until at least 2030 (2) . Successes in eradicating smallpox and rinderpest have been isolated events in a landscape of endemic and epidemic infections (3) . Newly emerging infectious agents represent a continuing challenge-for example, HIV in the 20th century; more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses; West Nile Virus; Nipah virus; drugresistant pathogens; novel influenza A strains; and a major Ebola virus outbreak in 2014-2015.",

This effect is seen in the age-related nature of infection and mortality in HIV changing the age distribution of the population, and in previous exposure to strains of influenza altering the distribution of influenza susceptibility. Such feedback mechanisms contribute to the nonlinearity of infection processes. Nonlinearity also leads to counterintuitive phenomena (Fig. 2) and prevents simple extrapolation of experience from one situation to another, such as when deciding whether to implement a vaccination policy in different countries (Fig. 1) .

In the initial phase of this outbreak, real-time estimates of the reproduction number or simple exponential extrapolation (14) allowed short-term predictions of epidemic growth that were used, for example, to plan for necessary bed capacity. Quantitative phylogenetic tools applied to samples from initial victims provided important estimates of the origin of the outbreak (15) . Early mechanistic models that explicitly took into account the roles played by different transmission routes or settings were informed by analysis of earlier outbreaks (16, 17) . When the failure to contain the epidemic with methods successful in previous outbreaks led to a scale-up of capacity driven by international aid, such models were used to assess the impact of, for example, reducing transmission at funerals (17) and whether the construction of novel types of treatment centers could end up doing more harm than good. Ensuring that the most effective combinations of interventions were implemented required close and fast interaction between modelers and policymakers (18) . Looking forward, models are now used to help clinical trial design and inform a debate on the optimal deployment of initially scarce Ebola vaccines, once such vaccines become available.",

The imperative to produce reliable and meaningful analysis for those treating infected people has to be balanced against the pressures and delays of scientific publication. In an ongoing outbreak, data can be patchy and reporting delayed, and different data sources are not always synthesized. When the Ebola outbreak expanded explosively in the summer of 2014, data were often lacking on the effect on transmission dynamics of the various control measures that operated simultaneously in the hectic circumstances of the most severely hit areas. In any emerging epidemic, underreporting is a critical challenge for ongoing assessment of this epidemic and has had enormous impact on predictions of outbreak size, but also of outbreak impact-for example, in terms of the case-fatality ratio (the proportion of cases that lead to death). Early in any outbreak, this estimate of severity can suffer from imprecise information on both the numerator (if not all deaths due to the infection are identified as such; for example, because health services are overwhelmed caring for the sick) and the denominator (if cases are not reported or, conversely, noncases get reported as cases if they are not laboratory-confirmed). This caused problems early in the H1N1 influenza outbreak first reported in in Mexico in 2009, as well as in the current Ebola outbreak. Although level of underreporting can be estimated from retrospective serological studies, it is usually not identifiable in real-time data.",

This leads to estimates of important epidemiological information such as length of latency, incubation and infectious periods and their statistical distributions, inferred transmission chains and trees early in outbreaks, the risks related to various transmission routes, or estimates of rates of evolution. Mathematical models in the strict sense refer to mathematical descriptions of processes thought to be associated with the dynamics of infection-for example, in a population or within an individual. Such models take many forms, depending on the level of biological knowledge of processes involved and data available, and depending on the purpose. Several classes of model are used, spanning the spectrum of information available. At one end of the range are detailed individual-based simulation models, where large numbers of distinct individual entities (with their own characteristic traits such as age, spatial location, sex, immune status, risk profile, or behavior pattern) are described in interaction with each other, possibly in a contact network, and with the infectious agent. At the other end are compartmental models where no individuals are recognized, but only states for individuals (for example: susceptible, infectious, immune) aggregated into compartments where everyone has the same average characteristics and where interaction is typically uniform (everybody interacts with everybody else). Such models do not describe the disease history of single individuals, but rather the time evolution of aggregated variables, such as the number of individuals that are currently susceptible.",

For example, a combined epidemic and economic model was fitted to fine-grained data from many sources to describe the dynamics of influenza in the United Kingdom, and the influence of previous vaccination programs (70) . With confidence in the model's predictions based on its ability to capture past patterns, it was used to look at alternative vaccination strategies and led to a new national policy to vaccinate school-age children (91) . Targeting those individuals most likely to spread the virus, rather than only those most likely to suffer the largest morbidity, is a marked departure from established practice in the UK and is currently under consideration elsewhere (92) .",

Models have shown that transmission of HIV depends on the epidemic phase and the sexual behavior of the population, and a large proportion of transmissions may occur late in infection (96) . Model-based inference in the Netherlands also suggested that the effective reproduction number (Box 4) had fallen below 1 due to a combination of low-risk behavior and a very effective diagnosis and treatment program (97) . The debate was transformed in the mid-2000s, when eradication of HIV through a \"test and treat\" strategy was hypothesized (98, 99) . Subsequent trial results showing that antiretroviral treatment (ART) of HIV-positive individuals could practically eliminate transmission within sexual partnerships when the index case is treated (100) have further supported the role of treatment as prevention. Although these findings have not dispelled concerns about transmission early in infection (93) , or about extra-couple transmission (101) , it is suggested that high population coverage of ART may have reduced the incidence of HIV infection in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (102) .",

The properties of stochasticity and nonlinearity strongly influence the accuracy of absolute predictions over long time horizons. Even if the mechanisms involved are broadly understood and relevant data are available, predicting the exact future course of an outbreak is impossible owing to changes in conditions in response to the outbreak itself, and because of the many chance effects in play. These stochastic effects dominate developments in situations with relatively few infected individuals that occur at emergence, approaching the threshold for sustained hosthost spread, or approaching elimination and eradication. This makes it virtually impossible to predict which infectious disease agent is going to emerge and evolve next and where, or to predict when and where the next or last case in an outbreak will occur. There is, typically in complex systems, a fundamental horizon beyond which accurate prediction is impossible. The field has yet to explore where that horizon is and whether computational tools and additional data (and if so which data) can stretch predictions to this limit. In contrast, \"what-if\" scenarios for public health intervention can provide qualitative (and increasingly semiquantitative) insight into their population consequences.",

Other techniques, such as so-called particle filters, approximate Bayesian computation, emulation, and their combinations with MCMC [e.g., (66) ], are rapidly developing and allow stochastic models that explicitly account for incomplete observations to be matched to time series of cases, giving insights into scenarios as diverse as cholera in Bangladesh (67) and influenza (68, 69) .

As models become open access, so should much of the data collected by governments, international agencies, and epidemiology research groups. Two outbreaks never occur in exactly matching circumstances, even for the same infectious agent, so there is potential to study many outbreaks in parallel to gain insight into the determinants of outbreak pattern and severity. Looking forward, there is a major opportunity to design experiments, clinical trials [for example for vaccines (80) ], and surveillance protocols to test model predictions or assumptions, and to help reduce or better target the enormous costs involved. By integrating modeling approaches throughout the full life cycle of infectious disease policies, including economic considerations (58, 70, 81) , health outcomes can be improved and scientific understanding can be advanced.",

Regardless, models are essential when diverse sources of data (including GRADE-scale evidence) need to be combined and weighed to assess quality of evidence and recommendations made in health care scenarios. In many cases, the definitive trial cannot be performed, and in such circumstances models can offer insight and extract maximum value from data that are available. In recent years, uniformity of practice and quality control for models has received more attention, resulting in initial attempts to characterize good modeling practice for infectious diseases (82, 83) .",
