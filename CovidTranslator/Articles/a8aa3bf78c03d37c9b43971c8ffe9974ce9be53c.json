Development of a Western blot assay for detection of antibodies against coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 11 (2) 417-422.]. One representative IgG1 monoclonal antibody (MAb), S-A5D5, was selected and characterized. S-A5D5 reacted specifically react with both recombinant and native nucleocapsid protein of SARS CoV. The reactivity of S-A5D5 with purified N195 protein and utilization of the MAb as a detector antibody to develop an antigen capture ELISA was assessed. As little as 37.5 pg of purified N protein and 50 TCID 50 of SARS CoV could be detected by the antigen capture ELISA. Specific binding of the MAb S-A5D5 to both purified N195 and SARS CoV nucleocapsid antigen was effectively inhibited by human SARS positive serum and guinea pig anti-N195 serum. The N protein in N195-spike recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells could also be identified. N protein was detected in 18 IFA IgM-positive serum samples collected from SARS confirmed patients, but not in nine samples collected from SARS recovery patient. No false positive results were given when 60 samples from healthy individuals were tested, and no cross-reaction occurred when infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), chicken coronavirus, was tested. This monoclonal antibody-based antigen capture ELISA is thus a powerful tool for early diagnosis of SARS CoV infection.",

The disease was widely prevalent in more than 30 countries with 8460 reported cases and causing 804 deaths in 2002 (WHO, 2003 . Thus, the development of diagnostic tests for specific and early detection of SARS CoV will contribute to the risk management of the disease. At present, SARS CoV infection is confirmed by the detection of viral RNA via PCR or RT-PCR (Drosten et al., 2004; Poon et al., 2004) , however, this is a technically demanding technique and this is susceptible to cross contamination. The determination of infectious virus in samples can be carried out by inoculating cell cultures, such as Vero cells, with a patient specimen, though this is relatively time consuming. Most serological assays developed so far are based on the detection of specific circulating antibodies He et al., 2004) . These assays are highly sensitive and specific for detecting antibodies against SARS CoV. However, a lack of detectable antibodies in SARS CoV infected patients at early stage or throughout the whole disease course has been reported. These cases oc-0166-0934/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, more effort should be directed towards developing a simple and inexpensive assay for the detection of SARS CoV proteins. Such tests could be used for early detection and follow-up of patients during treatment and thus reducing the workload of laboratory personnel.",

This might be due to the higher expression of nucleocapsid as compared with other viral proteins after SARS CoV infection (Rota et al., 2003) . These data indicated that nucleocapsid could play a crucial role in antibody response during infection. In our previous work, a major immunodomain of recombinant SARS CoV nucleocapsid (N195) was identified and used to develop a Western blot for the detection of antibodies against SARS CoV infection, the sensitivity and specificity were 98.5 and 100%, respectively . From these results, we hypothesize that monoclonal antibodies against N195 would specifically recognize SARS CoV in immunoassays.",

            "text": "SARS CoV is an etiological agent causing severe acute respiratory syndrome, a newly emergent disease. There is a global need to develop a sensitive and specific immunoassay to detect SARS CoV. In our previous work, a major immunodomain of N protein (N195) was identified and N195-based Western blot assay was developed to detect antibodies against SARS CoV. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a MAb against this N195 protein will improve the test specificity. This paper describes the production of monoclonal antibody against N195 protein as well as the development of an antigen capture ELISA, offering a safe, cost-effective tool for detection of SARS coronavirus.",

Moreover, the MAb at 1:160 dilution was detectable by Sf-9 cell-based IFA whereas MAb at 1:10 dilution could be detected by SARS CoV infected Vero cells-based IFA. This is partially explained by the fact that the nucleocapsid gene, fused with truncated spike gene, was placed under the transcriptional control of the strong polyhedrin promoter of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) in the recombinant baculovirus, leading to an abundance of N195 in infected Sf-9 cells. The recognition of the authentic nucleocapsid antigen indicated that the MAb produced in this work can be used to develop immunoassays, for instance, IFA, for direct detection of SARS CoV from nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from the patients that are diagnosed as probable or suspected cases under clinical criteria.",

The detection limit of the test is 37.5 pg of standard protein and 50 TCID 50 of SARS CoV. This sensitivity is consistent with the previous descriptions of sensitivity in other antigen capture ELISAs. In an attempt to further improve the sensitivity of the assay, MAb against the immunogenic Sc fragment of spike protein was produced in this experiment and used as a detector antibody to detect spike protein in infected Sf-9 cell lysates and inactivated SARS CoV. However, this method did not improve sensitivity.",

Due to a lack of coronavirus infected human samples, IBV was used to assess the specificity of the MAb for other coronaviruses. In this experiment, IBV could not be recognized by the MAb, indicating the MAb's specificity. These observations suggest that the MAb-based assay is specific for detection of SARS CoV infection. Moreover, the N protein was consistently detected in our limited IgM-positive samples but not in eight IgG-positive sera from convalescent patients, indicating the potential of early detection of SARS CoV infection although it needs clinical trials, consistent with new finding (Di et al., 2005) . Theoretically, antigen should be released from infected cells or viruses and appear in the host blood system followed by the presence of relative specific antibody. Additionally, due to the abundant expression of N protein compared to other proteins during viral replication in infected tissues, the host immune system is exposed to a larger load of N antigen. Therefore, this antigen capture ELISA, based on MAb to N protein, might provide a more sensitive method for early detection of SARS CoV infection.",
