One approach to examining the mechanism responsible for the observed functional T cell suppression is to determine whether virus replication is required for its induction. To this end, mice were inoculated oronasally with MHV-JHM that was inactivated with short-wave ultraviolet light, betapropiolactone or psoralen. Mice were also inoculated with live MHV-JHM after recovery from homotypic or heterotypic MHV infection. Spleen cells from BALB mice inoculated oronasally with inactivated MHV-JHM yielded extremely variable in vitro proliferative responses after concanavalin A stimulation. MHV-susceptible mice exposed oronasaUy or intraperitoneally to virus inactivated by any of the minimum effective treatments failed to seroconvert. Immunization with psoralen-treated virus intraperitoneally in Freund's complete adjuvant or oronasally failed to protect from live virus challenge, but survivors had elevated virus-specific serum IgG antibody titers compared to mock-immunized controls at two weeks post-challenge. Spleen cells from mice that were challenged after recovery from homotypic live virus infection did not exhibit the profound in vitro T cell suppression normally observed during the acute stage of primary infection. In contrast, MHV-JHM challenge of mice vaccinated with heterotypic live MHV-S resulted in significantly depressed in vitro T celt function. The combined data suggest that either virus replication or exposure to more concentrated antigen may be required for induction of the dramatic T cell dysfunction that occurs as a consequence of MHV-JHM infection as well as for a detectable MHV-specific humoral response.",

An important issue pertaining to the mechanism responsible for this immunosuppression is whether virus replication is required for its induction. Studies with other viruses have yielded varying results. Measles virus-associated inhibition of mitogendriven proliferation and immunoglobulin production is eliminated when UVor heat-inactivated virus is used [24, 26] . The immunosuppressive variant of the parvovirus, minute virus of mice, did not inhibit the appearance of cytotoxic T cells in mixed lymphocyte cultures if used in the form of UV-inactivated virus or purified viral capsids [15] . Live Newcastle disease virus, which does not achieve a full replication cycle in murine cells, induced suppressed concanavalin A (Con A)-driven and allogeneic responses in mice, whereas UV-inactivated virus did not [11] . In contrast, inhibition of the poxvirus DNA polymerase with phosphonoacetic acid did not affect the ability of malignant rabbit fibroma virus to suppress lymphocyte proliferation or initiation of antibody production [37] . Proliferation of bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by either Con A or interleukin (IL) 2 was inhibited by bovine herpesvirus 1, although less than 0.1% of the cells were productively infected [8] . In a model system using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and vesicular stomatitis virus, Sendal virus, Friend leukemia virus, herpes virus types 1 and 2, or a battery of avian retroviruses known to be incapable of entering and infecting human lymphocytes, both live and UV-inactivated viruses abrogated proliferative responses both to mitogens (Con A and phytohemagglutinin) and allogeneic cells [27, 39, 40] . Thus, the ability of replication-defective virus to alter immune function is unpredictable.",

In addition, livers from BALB mice inoculated oronasally with either UV-inactivated or BPL-treated MHV and used for functional T cell assays were processed for histology. They were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5~tm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The concentration of infectious virus in the liver is very high during the acute phase of active infection [1, 32] , and there is a 100% correlation between liver histopathology and virus recovery from this major target organ (Smith and Barthold, unpubl, obs.). Inactivation of psoralen-treated MHV-JHM was further confirmed by the inability of primers specific for a segment of the M gene to amplify in polymerase chain reaction [19] .",

Cells from four of four mice given BPLinactivated virus and tested seven days later were hyper-responsive. Responses of cells from mice given UV-treated MHV-JHM were quite variable in three separate experiments, despite the fact that confirmation of virus inactivation was obtained for each inoculated mouse. Spleen cells from mice given psoralen-treated virus yielded Con A-induced proliferative responses that were essentially identical to those of cells from naive control mice. Mouse-to-mouse variation was minimal among animals that received psoralen-treated MHV-JHM. Of the inactivation methods used, psoralen treatment is the least harsh and therefore least likely to cause conformational changes in structural proteins [ 17] . The lack of a detectable virus-specific humoral response even after two exposures to psoralen-treated virus, including one parenteral injection in Freund's complete adjuvant, renders interpretation and conclusions difficult. It could be argued, however, that the immune systems of mice twice immunized with psoralen-inactivated virus were stimulated, since these mice had consistently, albeit marginally in the case of oronasal inoculation, elevated antibody titers compared to mock-vaccinated mice after live virus challenge.",

It may also be argued that oronasal exposure to killed virus may be less likely to stimulate an immune response than parenteral inoculation, with or without adjuvant. However, our research program has historically been devoted to studies of MHV as a natural pathogen of laboratory mice. We have, therefore, always used natural routes of exposure. The studies in which immunosuppression by live MHV-JHM were documented [13, 14, 33, 36] were performed with mice infected orally, intranasally or by the combined routes. It therefore seemed reasonable, if not essential, to expose mice to killed virus by the same natural routes in attempts to determine whether such virus could induce immune dysfunction.",

            "text": "The accumulated data from studies using three inactivation methods also provide support for the notion that virus replication or exposure to more antigen is required for induction of a detectable antibody response to and protection from challenge with MHV-JHM. This contrasts with reports for other viruses. For instance, arthropod-borne viruses and ecologically related viruses that cause high mortality among peripherally inoculated mice are frequently BPL-inactivated in order to prepare immune sera [7] . Reports on the immunogenicity of psoralen-treated virus are rare; however, psoralen-inactivated crude Pichinde virus, without adjuvant, induced seroconversion among intramuscularly injected guinea pigs within two weeks [17] . Guinea pigs given two doses of virus that was 25-fold more dilute, again without adjuvant, also seroconverted [17] . In addition to the methods reported here, we also evaluated the ability of formalininactivated MHV-JHM to induce an antibody response, using a modification of a recently published technique [18] . In that study, inoculation of mice with Responses to mouse hepatitis virus immunization 49 lactic dehydrogenase elevating virus treated with 0.06% formalin at 37 \u00b0C for as long as 5 h yielded hybridomas that produced virus neutralizing antibody [18] . Treatment of MHV-JHM with 0.05% formalin at 37 \u00b0C for 25 rain (minimum effective treatment time) resulted in complete loss of infectivity. However, Sencar mice inoculated oronasally or intraperitoneally with that material had not seroconverted when tested 21 days later. Formalin seemed a reasonable treatment choice, since higher concentrations do not destroy MHV antigens [6, 35] . The possibility that an antibody response could be stimulated by parenteral inoculation of mice with inactivated MHV-JHM in a potent adjuvant, perhaps with several boosters, cannot be excluded. However, as stated above, the major goal of the reported studies was to characterize T cell function of mice given killed virus by a natural route.",

            "text": "In view of the high prevalence of MHV infection and the rapidity with which the virus is transmitted throughout a colony, control by means of elimination of the agent, as has been the case with ectromelia (mousepox) virus [30] , seems an unlikely possibility. One strategy is development of a vaccine that might provide protection without the functional immune deficits documented after live virus administration. Since protection from challenge was not afforded by psoralen-inactivated virus, immune function of mice challenged after live virus vaccination was evaluated. The design of the live virus vaccination-challenge experiments reported here was identical to that described in an earlier report [2] , in which complete resistance to homotypic challenge was demonstrated. In the earlier study, BALB mice that were challenged 30 days after an immunizing infection with MHV-JHM had histologically normal livers and noses four days after challenge, and virus was not detected in livers at that interval. This was strong evidence that homotypic live virus vaccination protected against infection upon challenge. In contrast, mice immunized with biologically similar, but antigenically distinct, MHV-S were fully susceptible to MHV-JHM challenge, based on the same criteria [2] . In the present study, spleen cells from mice challenged with MHV-JHM after recovery from homotypic infection yielded Con A-induced proliferative responses that were suppressed, but not to the extent observed for cells from mice undergoing primary infection (Mock/ JHM in Table 3 ). Function of cells from mice immunized with live MHV-S and challenged with MHV-JHM was suppressed in a manner similar to that of cells from mice sustaining primary infection. These data affirm by different methodology the earlier report of highly strain-specific challenge immunity to murine coronaviruses [2] , with both studies strongly suggesting that a polyvalent vaccine would be required to protect mice against infection with the many MHV strains that circulate in animal colonies. The current experiments suggest a caveat, however; even a polyvalent vaccine might not eliminate the deleterious effects of MHV on in vitro assays of immune function, since function of cells from mice challenged with homotypic virus was depressed, albeit not to the extent seen after mock vaccination and challenge. Therefore, efficacy testing of any candidate vaccine should include studies to determine whether vaccination (Table 3) was unexpected, since the M H V -J H M EIA has been used to detect MHV-S antibody in sera from mice injected intraperitoneally with infected mouse brain homogenate [35] . The sera from MHV-Simmunized mice did contain M H V antibody based on the IFA test with bivalent antigen. The EIA uses as antigen infected cell monolayers in which about 75% of the cells are fused [35] . Syncytium formation by M H V relies on the presence of the surface E2 or S glycoprotein which is also the protein against which neutralizing and protective antibodies are directed. Mature virus particles released into the culture medium may also be precipitated when formalin is added to inactivate the virus prior to assay. Thus, this modified enzyme immunoassay may, under certain conditions, be more likely to detect strain-specific antibody than assays that use immobilized soluble antigen. Whether route of inoculation plays a role is currently unknown. However, high MHV-JHM-specific antibody titers were positively correlated in this study with relative, but not complete, protection from MHV-JHM-induced immune dysfunction.",
