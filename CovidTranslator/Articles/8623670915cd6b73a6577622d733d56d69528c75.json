Keynesianism A system of social entitlements that included unemployment insurance, health care, mother's allowance, and welfare, originating with John Maynard Keynes and instituted after the Great Depression of the 1930s in many industrialized nations. Neoliberalism A strategy of governance that attempts as much as possible to reduce a state's responsibility for social entitlements and to download responsibilities for care onto cities, communities, families, and individuals. Post-Fordism A globalized system of production and consumption characterized by the increasing use of robotics in production systems, externalizing uncertainties of the market to small-time suppliers who produce on demand (just in time), and the marketing of specialized goods to globalized \"niches\" of consumers. Post-Structuralism A movement in French continental philosophy centered on the destabilization of claims to truth and variously connected to the antihumanist rejection of a unified rational subject; a rejection of binary oppositions; and a view which sees knowledge as fluid, unstable, and discursively produced rather than ideological.",

The topic appears so vast that when properly charteddlike Borges' famous map drawn at a 1:1 scaledso much ground is covered as to become practically and analytically useless. Moreover, the relationship would seem a truism: societies create spaces that best express their needs; spaces in turn constrain or enable societal developments. But how we conceive of this relationship subtends any attempt to understand, critique, or transform, the social world. Our understanding of society-space, as a totality, determines the vantage point from which we understand the social world. It locates these delimited processes, both literally and figuratively, in relation to a social whole.",

Early social theoristsdthe sociologist, Georg Simmel, and geographer, Freidrich Ratzel, for example, posited an iterative relation between society and space. Inspired by the rapidity of urban industrialization in the late 1800s, they counterposed rural existence to the distinctive qualities of urban life. Urban life, they theorized, became blended and compressed, a locus where anonymity encouraged nonconformity in thought.

Beginning with the Second International and writings of Gy\u00f6rgy Luka'cs (considered the founder of Western Marxism), attention to space was considered a fetish and diversion from class struggle.

Space was not merely a productive component of contemporary capitalism; capitalism was now produced, itself, by space. Working along multiple trajectories Lefebvre charted the geohistory of spaces. This he traced from the world of early human history organized primarily through natural spaces (in which natural features were discovered and exploited), to contemporary abstract spaces, wherein distinctions between places in the globe were erased and nature was subordinated to a grid of functions. In this vision, (inspired by Lefebvre's own lifetime experience of the French state's relentless modernization of its countryside), modernity and modernization were not emancipatory conditions, but rather an expression of a commodification tending toward barbarism. Modernization was a means by which capitalism ensured, by stealth, its survival. Social space raised questions about the centrality of class as the sine qua non of social transformation. The city was elevated from its status as a micro expression of larger socioeconomic processes to a central point of intervention.

The challenge initially was to document the difference that gender made. Feminists charted the gendered characteristics of capitalist spacedfrom suburb to gentrified central city, the former badly serving women who had joined a secondary labor force by the mid-1970s, and the latter reducing distance between home and work. The doubled roles of women as homemakers and as part of a paid labor force introduced its own spatial dynamics into the development of capitalism. For example, industry's flight to the suburbs in the 1970s was as much to exploit a female labor force tied close to home as it was to flee organized unions in urban areas. The difficulties in advancing a feminist perspective in the early years should be underscored. Feminist geographies were sometimes castigated by established academics in the field, as being \"not the stuff of geography\", but rather more like urban sociology.",

Exemplary in this regard is Gillian Rose's Feminism and Geography, and her concept of paradoxical space. Other geographers have extended her perspective to investigate phenomenon of passing. Griselda Pollock, a scholar of the arts, has undertaken a similar reassessment of spaces of modernity through analysis of impressionist paintings.

While the margin marks a site of exclusion, it is thus understood as a potential site of recuperation and resistance.

The idea that these spaces operate in the here and now has been forcefully demonstrated in McKittrick's mobilization of paradoxical space in Demonic Grounds. Here she explores the range of micro-geographies that depict American slavery as intimately bound up in the constitution of modernity. For example, the auction block displayed a perverse rationality as a site of measurement of human worth. However, she also argues these spaces can afford possibilities for resistance.

In working through the four broad approaches outlined about, geographers have been adept at demonstrating the salience of space to social theory and restored its dynamism in the society-space couplet. In each of these approaches, geographers have offered analytical insights and new conceptual orientations toward space as a site of both research and praxis. At times they have built on or sharpened spatial concepts elaborated by theorists working outside the discipline and at times created their own, particularly where the salience of space had been ignored.",

The most pressing concern in contemporary human geography is how one might think of the interface between these competing visions of the subject and its attendant spatialities. It would be difficult to suggest that one of these approaches is more relevant than the others. In a world where the gap between rich and poor is, if anything, accelerating with attendant decline of cities and regions; where new and troubling forms of surveillance (with the introduction of biotechnologies) are coming into being; where new hybridized subjects are surfacing; and where desire is being mobilized to sustain affective regimes and intensified exploitative production, each of these approaches offers insights into contemporary societal transformations and social inequities.",

A new strategy at the interface is required, in order to be able to imagine different possibilities for life and work in a more equitable world.",
