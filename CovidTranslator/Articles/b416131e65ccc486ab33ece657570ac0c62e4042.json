Indeed, multiple inter-connect factors contribute to the dynamic and fastevolving ecosystem, which includes humans and their viruses. Anthropologic factors, such as the introduction of effective vaccines against viruses responsible for poliomyelitis, measles, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, varicella-zoster, influenza A and B, as well as the adoption of vaccination programs during the second half of the 20th century has almost abolished the morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases in pediatric patients in Western Countries. However, the end of the last century was also characterized by the sudden and irreversible opening of European Countries to global exchanges of goods and international travel, with the possibility of re-emergence in Europe of \"old\" viral diseases as imported cases from countries without effective vaccination programs.",

Moreover, global warming has critically modified in just a few decades the environmental conditions favouring the spread, in our geographic region, of vectors carrying arthropod-borne viruses such as chickungunya virus, West Nile virus and Phleboviruses. The progressive reduction of cultivated areas, and their consequent reforestation, has allowed the increase in wild animal populations and the spread of diseases such as rabies, tick-borne encephalitis and hantavirus renal syndrome in Northern Europe. Although, the latter zoonotic viruses will unlikely have a great impact on the pediatric population (newborns in particular), outbreaks of mosquito-transmitted viruses can affect patients of all ages. Finally, recent technical advancements have allowed the identification of previously unrecognized autochthonous viral species responsible for respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurologic diseases in pediatric patients, including newborns.",

There is a general perception that the 2009-2010 influenza A pandemic was clinically milder than previous pandemics. How-ever, the death rate during the last pandemic has recently been recalculated estimating that the 2009 global pandemic respiratory mortality was about 10-fold higher than the World Health Organization's laboratory-confirmed mortality count [1] . Although the pandemic mortality estimate was similar in magnitude to that of seasonal influenza, a marked shift toward mortality among persons <65 years of age occurred, so that many more life-years were lost [1] . Simonsen et al., could not be more precise about the fatality rate stratified by more defined age groups, but a survey by the Centers for Diseases Control, Atlanta, USA, spanning a 10-year period reported that pediatric mortality in the USA following the emergence of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strain was substantially higher than that in previous and following years (http://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/PedFluDeath.html).",

The identification of hMPV was made possible with the RAP-PCR (RNA arbitrarily primed PCR) technique for the identification of unknown viruses in cell culture [2] . Clinical symptoms associated with hMPV infection are similar to those caused by human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, and range from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia [2] . In addition, it was shown that by the age of five years, virtually all children are seropositive for hMPV [2] . Thus, besides RSV, a previously unrecognized paramyxovirus can support respiratory tract infections in small children. This finding has immediate diagnostic and treatment correlates, since an effective human monoclonal antibody (Palivizumab) is currently licensed for prevention and treatment of RSV infections only [3] . More recently, cross-neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies have been developed for treatment strategies with broader specificity [4] .",

Usually, HPeV infections are asymptomatic, while less frequently they have been reported to be associated with mild respiratory and gastrointestinal syndromes in children [8] .

In infants, phlebovirus infection may also present as a usually self-solving meningitis. Diagnosis can be difficult due to the low awareness of this infection during the summer season in the Mediterranean region, the availability of few serologic and molecular diagnostic assays and the short duration of viremia.",

Confirmation was later made with the isolation of wild poliovirus type 1 in at least ten cases (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_10_29/en/). According to the European Center for Diseases Control (ECDC) Syria has not experienced indigenous cases of polio since 1995, while the last laboratory-confirmed imported case was reported in 1999. Immunization against polio has been mandatory in Syria since 1964 and the reported coverage with three doses of oral polio vaccine was above 95% in children under one year of age between 2002 and 2010. Since 2010, the health situation in Syria has progressively deteriorated due to the ongoing conflict and the decline in vaccination coverage for all vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/ RRA%20poliomyelitis%20Syria%2021%2010%202013.pdf).",

The incidence of measles in Europe has decreased significantly since 1998, while the trend inverted in 2010 with a significant increase in the number of cases. The total number of reported measles cases in Europe was 30,265 in 2010, 30,567 in 2011 and 8,230 in 2012 bringing the incidence of this disease to 16.2 cases per million in the last year of surveillance (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/measles/ epidemiological_data/Pages/Number-of-measles-cases-2011.aspx). The increase in 2010 was primarily due to a large outbreak in Bulgaria with more than 24,000 reported cases and 24 deaths affecting mainly infants, children and young adults [24] . Re-emergence of measles in Europe is due to multiple social, psychological and behavioural factors, including a lower perception of the risks associated with the disease, the growing (unmotivated) fear of vaccination-associated adverse events, ethnic and religious traditions, which have led to the accumulation over time of a susceptible population.",
