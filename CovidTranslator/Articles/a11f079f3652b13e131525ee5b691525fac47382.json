As an infection is spreading through a population, it is more convenient to work with an effective reproduction number , which is defined as the number of secondary infections that arise from a typical primary case [5] . The magnitude of is a useful indicator for evaluating the risk of an infectious disease and the validity of controlling the epidemic.

To estimate the reproduction number , the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease, ( ), is required to be available [5, [9] [10] [11] [12] ; however, this distribution is often unknown. In the existing literature, many scholars used exponential distribution [5] , normal distribution [5] , Weibull distribution [9, 10] , and Gamma distribution [3, 12] to approximate ( ). Theoretically, to use these distributions to approximate ( ), one needs to know enough information about symptom onsets of all cases, namely, large sample cases for . Regarding the incomplete information, one also applied the Monte-Carlo method [4] and Bayesian statistical inference [11] to estimating ( ). However, thus far, there is scant literature to discuss the potential application of the maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) [13] [14] [15] in estimating the reproduction number. Our letter fills this gap. In the statistical inference, MaxEnt is a powerful tool of predicting probability distributions. The main idea of MaxEnt is to estimate a target probability distribution by finding the probability distribution of maximum entropy, subject to a set of constraints that represent our incomplete information for the target distribution [13] .",

According to the report of China CDC [2] , January 8, 2020 was considered as the last day of a contagion period in Wuhan, China; therefore, we mark January 9, 2020 as the first day of the next contagion period. Based on this setting, the first period we report is from January 9, 2020 to January 22, 2020. In fact, this setting agrees with the date of locking down the Wuhan city, January 23, 2020. Here, we have collected the national-level data of the accumulative infected, recovered, and death cases of China's epidemic from January 10, 2020 to March 4, 2020, see Figure 2 . By using the data in Figure 2 , it is easy to calculate the number of real-time infected cases, ( ), in China for each day. This result has been shown in Figure 3 .

This implies that the epidemic has been effectively controlled. It should be pointed out that the last day of the third period (February 19) is just the turning point of the epidemic, refer to Figure 3 ; therefore, the real data supports our calculations for the reproduction number. As the epidemic come to the fourth period (from February 20, 2020 to March 4, 2020), the reproduction number is eventually reduced to 0.6028, a level below 1.

In the existing literature, many scholars used exponential distribution, normal distribution, Weibull distribution, and Gamma distribution to approximate the generation interval distribution. To do so, one needs to collect enough information about symptom onsets of all cases, which requires examining a large number of cases. By contrast, the maximum entropy method has more advantage of predicting probability distributions given the incomplete information. In this letter, we argue that, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, one can determine its probability distribution function by using maximum entropy method.
