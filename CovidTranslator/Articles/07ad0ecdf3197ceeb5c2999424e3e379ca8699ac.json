Therefore, it cannot be assumed that biosecurity measures and levels of implementation on veal farms are comparable to conventional dairy and beef farms. The veal-rearing system is highly similar throughout the majority of the main veal-producing countries, often with veal companies working across borders (Sans and Fontguyon, 2009 ).

White veal calves are slaughtered at a maximum age of 8 months. Most veal calf farms in Belgium are part of a veal company (Pardon et al., 2014) . Veal companies organize the veal farming process from the top down, with their own sorting centers, feed factories, and slaughterhouses.

In the list, both calf diseases and diseases of high importance in cattle, or with zoonotic potential, were included. Diseases not occurring in, or not at risk of emergence in Belgium (never reported in Europe), were removed from the initial list. Second, three different data sources were accessed to select the most important diseases from this list: 1) a combination of recently described prioritization methods applied to the literature search, including all notifiable diseases (ANSES, 2010; Havelaar et al., 2010; Humblet et al., 2012; McIntyre et al., 2014; Ciliberti et al., 2015) ; 2) data on disease occurrences in the last three years, provided by regional animal health centers; and 3) an online survey among bovine veterinary practitioners (Renault et al., 2018a) .",

For this reason, a search of the PubMed database was performed with this combination of terms: \"name of disease and/or pathogen,\" or \"cattle,\" \"risk factors\" or \"epidemiology\" or \"prevalence\" or \"biosecurity measures\" or \"control measures.\" The list of risk factors and biosecurity measures for each disease was integrated into an exhaustive list with all known (published) risk factors and biosecurity measures relevant for veal calves. If possible, a corresponding biosecurity measure was identified for each risk factor. Risk factors that cannot be controlled, or for which no biosecurity measure is available (e.g., birth weight, weather), as well as risk factors related to parturition or shortly thereafter (e.g., hygiene at parturition and provision of colostrum) were discarded. Though this last category is considered important, these risk factors are outside the control of the veal farmer because the animals arrive at two weeks of age. The total list of biosecurity measures is provided in Annex 1. This table also provides the number of risk factors each measure addresses, and the number of diseases for which it was cited in the literature. In Table 2 , an overview of the 12 most important biosecurity measures, and their relation to the 34 most important calf diseases is provided.",

A draft questionnaire was tested on two veal farms.

Of the 8 farmers not willing to participate, 1 was no longer active, 3 cited a lack of time, 3 wished to receive no visitors to keep a closed farm, and 1 farmer did not give a reason. The study farms were visited between November 2016 and February 2017, and face-to-face interviews were conducted by the first author in Dutch, the native tongue of both farmers and interviewer.

The results were analyzed using basic descriptive analysis. The frequency of each answer and, when possible, the mean, median, standard deviation (SD), quartiles, minimum, and maximum were calculated. A biosecurity scoring system was created with binary variables, where 1 indicated the presence of a biosecurity measure and 0 indicated the absence. These scores were added up to generate a score on a scale of 0 to 10 for each biosecurity category, with a total of seven categories describing measures concerning animal movements, visitors, contact with other animals, disease management, compartmentation, cleaning and disinfection, and calf management. Next, a categorical principal components analysis (CATPCA; SPSS 25.0) and clustering analysis, as previously described by Van Steenwinkel et al. (2011) and Sarrazin et al. (2014) , were performed to combine the information originating from multiple variables. Based on this information, the researchers assessed whether the veal companies influenced biosecurity levels. To this end, the categories were given an ordinal measurement scale in the CATPCA analysis. The veal companies were included as a supplementary nominal measurement to explore their relationship with the biosecurity levels. For the analysis, 3 major and a group of minor veal companies, as described in Pardon et al. (2014) , were randomly assigned a number from 1 to 4. The object scores, following the CATPCA analysis, were included in a k-means cluster analysis (KMCA; SPSS 25.0) to compare the clusters to the veal companies. \"2\" means the measure was mentioned as such in literature for the disease, \"1\" means the relevance of the measure could be deduced from context, while \"0\" means that the risk factor was not found in literature for that disease.",

In veal farms, only two types of visitors visit the farm frequently: the veterinarian and the representative of the veal company. Conventional farms often have more types of visitors, such as salesmen, feed suppliers, hoof trimmers and drivers of milk trucks (Renault et al., 2018a) . Nevertheless, the frequency with which some visitors enter influences the risk for introduction of disease. Although only a limited number of visitors enter the farm, the precautionary measures they take upon entrance are insufficient (Table 4 ). As these professional visitors are, by definition, high-risk visitors since they have frequent contact with animals from different farms, the risk of spreading infection through this route remains high. The implementation of a minimum of preventive measures, such as wearing herd-specific clothing and footwear, by professional visitors is a relatively easy and cheap measure that can be implemented on short notice.",

Besides the advantages of keeping young, susceptible calves separated from the older cohorts (Sarrazin et al., 2014) , each compartment can be cleaned, disinfected, and thoroughly dried during the sanitary vacancy. A clean and disinfected environment is recommended in the literature for multiple diseases, such as Cryptosporidium parvum, Salmonella spp., and BVD (Daugschies and Najdrowski, 2005; Fossler et al., 2005; Villarroel et al., 2007) . Next to the frequency of cleaning and disinfection, a welldesigned and adhered-to protocol, including the seven steps described in Van Immerseel et al. (2018) , is equally important. These seven steps consist of removal of all organic material, soaking all surfaces, high pressure cleaning, drying, disinfection, drying and testing the efficiency of the procedure. If the stables are not cleaned and disinfected properly, pathogens can survive even after a sufficiently long sanitary vacancy. Research suggests that the length of the sanitary vacancy, which in this study was, on average, ten days, is not as important as a proper cleaning and disinfection procedure (Luyckx et al., 2016) . The farmers indicated that they thoroughly cleaned and disinfected their stables more often during recent years due to the distribution of cleaning and disinfection products by the veal company. This example illustrates that the veal company could play a crucial role in the motivation toward the implementation of biosecurity measures. It also illustrates that the farmers are not the sole decision makers and can be influenced regarding their biosecurity policies. Possibly, this understanding explains why several farmers answered that they were not obliged by government or veal company to apply certain measures, but were waiting for guidelines to follow.",

Several biosecurity measures of high importance, such as \"all-in, all-out\" and compartmentation, are implemented relatively well whereas other measures, such as cleaning and disinfection, isolation of sick animals, and measures for visitors can easily be improved. The improvement of some measures regarding the introduction of animals from a huge number of different origins with variable infectious and immunity status will require more fundamental changes in the organization of the industry. In the implementation of these improvements, the collaboration between farmers, veal companies, and veterinarians will be crucial.",
