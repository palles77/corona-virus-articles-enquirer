Here we report that transfection of Sf9 cells with a single recombinant baculovirus encoding M and S proteins resulted in the assembly of IBV VLPs; this is the first report that S protein plus M protein alone were able to be assembled into VLPs for coronaviruses. We further showed that the generated IBV VLPs could induce humoral immune responses in a level comparable to that of inactivated IBV vaccine, and more importantly the IBV VLPs could elicit significantly higher cellular immune responses than the inactivated IBV vaccine. In summary, the assembly of IBV VLPs with M and S proteins provided a simple strategy for generating VLPs for coronaviruses, and the generated IBV VLPs laid a feasible foundation for the development of an effective vaccine against infection of IBV in the future.",

IBV M protein is found in the cis-Golgi network and cis-Golgi complex when expressed alone [5] , and cannot be released into the supernatant unless IBV E is present [6] . In contrast, studies of other coronaviruses suggested that the M protein was observed in the Golgi area and plasma membranes of a variety of cells when expressed alone [7] , and can form sedimentable particles and release from infected cells [8] .",

Liu et al. found that influenza M1 protein and SARS S protein could assemble chimeric SARS-CoV VLPs in Sf9 cell [25] . For mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59), Vennema et al. showed that transfection of OST7-1 cells with vaccinia virus encoding M and E proteins resulted in the VLP formation [26] . These reports strongly suggested that M and E were the minimal molecules required for the coronavirus-like particles regardless of virus types and cell lines used in the studies. In contrast, our results showed for the first time that IBV M and S proteins were efficient assembled into VLPs in Sf9 cells with a single recombinant baculovirus encoding M and S proteins. This might not be a complete surprise. As for IBV, Corse and Machamer reported that while the presence of E protein could enhance the release of M proteins in the sedimentable particles from the culture supernatants, M protein alone was capable of being released in the sedimentable particles from the culture supernatants in OST7-1cells with a vaccinia-T7 polymerase expression system [18, particularly Fig. 6 ]. In addition, the native envelope trimeric S glycoprotein is not necessary for particle formation but is incorporated into VLPs when present [22] ; and incorporation of spikes into coronavirus particles is mediated by the S protein's carboxy-terminal domain and effected by interactions between the S protein and the M protein [16] . The showing of IBV VLPs formed by M and S proteins demonstrated a simple strategy for production of coronavirus-like particles for coronaviruses.",

In line with previous literatures, our results showed that IBV VLPs induced humoral antibody responses (i.e., serum IBV-specific IgG antibodies and IBV-specific neutralization antibodies) in a level comparable to that of the inactivated IBV vaccines in mice and chickens, and both IBV VLPs and inactivated IBV vaccine induced significantly higher humoral antibody responses (P < 0.01). For the cellular immune responses, the IFN-r and IL-4 were detected using the ELIspot assay. The results revealed that IBV VLPs elicited high levels of IFN-r and IL-4, but the inactivated H120 vaccine only induced IL-4 at a significantly lower level (P < 0.01). The results demonstrated that IBV VLPs could elicit both Th1-and Th2-type cellular immune responses, but inactivated H120 only stimulated Th2-type cellular immune response. Previous studies showed that VLPs could elicit more effective antibody responses than proteins in their nonnative forms [27, 28] . The reason for the results that the inactivated H120 vaccine used in this study had slightly lower neutralizing antibody titers and a significantly lower level of cellular immune responses than VLPs might be that a portion of S molecules lost their native forms during inactivation with formalin. Our results demonstrated that the IBV VLPs mimic the conformation and organization of authentic native viruses, and their immunogenicities were reserved.",
