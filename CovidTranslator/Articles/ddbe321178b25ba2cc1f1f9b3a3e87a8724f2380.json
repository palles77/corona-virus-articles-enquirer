            "text": "Feline morbillivirus (FeMV) is an emerging morbillivirus first described in cats less than a decade ago. FeMV has been associated with chronic kidney disease of cats characterized by tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), although this aspect is still controversial and not demonstrated with certainty. To investigate FeMV prevalence and genomic characteristics, an epidemiological survey was conducted in a total number of 127 household cats originating from two Italian regions, Abruzzi and Emilia-Romagna. A total number of 69 cats originating from three feline colonies were also enrolled for the study. Correlation with TIN was investigated by employing a total number of 35 carcasses. Prevalence of FeMV RNA was higher in urine samples collected from cats of colonies (P = 31.8%, CI 95% 22.1-43.6) compared to household cats (P = 8.66%, CI 95% 4.9-14.9) and in young and middle-aged cats while prevalence of FeMV Abs was higher in old cats. Sequences obtained straight from infected biological samples, either partial or complete, cluster into two clades within FeMV genotype 1, distantly related to FeMV genotype 2. Immunohistochemistry analysis of kidney sections of FeMV RNA positive cats revealed immunoreactivity within epithelial cells of renal tubuli and inflammatory cells. However, statistically significant association between FeMV and renal damages, including TIN, was not demonstrated (p= 0.0695, Fisher exact test). By virus histochemistry performed with FeMV-negative feline tissues and a FeMV isolate, tropism for different cellular types such as inflammatory cells residing in blood vessels of kidney and brain, airway epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and to a lesser extent, the central nervous system, was demonstrated. Additional studies are warranted in order to establish viral tropism and immune response during the early phases of infection and to disentangle the role of FeMV in co-infection processes.",

This genus includes several enveloped, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses infecting humans (measles virus), terrestrial and aquatic animals (e. g. canine distemper virus, CDV) with severe and fatal systemic diseases (de Vries et al., 2015) . Morbilliviruses have a linear single stranded negative RNA genome of nearly 16 kb encoding six structural proteins. One of these is the haemagglutinin protein (H) coded by the H gene. H protein is a major determinant for virus-host interaction and viral entry via attachment to signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) (Tatsuo et al., 2001) . The H protein binds the receptor resulting in cellular attachment and activation of the F protein by tissue-specific proteases leading to cellular infection.",

In most cats, CKD is also a progressive disease and can be accompanied by a wide range of clinical and pathological changes, but the underlying aetiology of CKD is often undiagnosed. CKD could result, indeed, from a variety of potential factors that may include toxic insults, hypoxia, chronic glomerulonephritis, chronic pyelonephritis, upper urinary tract obstructions, viral infections, that lead to a final common pathway of irreversible, progressive kidney damage (Elliott and Barber, 1998) . Idiopathic CKD such as pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis and TIN due to unknown causes has been reported extensively (Elliott and Barber, 1998; Mayer-Roenne et al., 2007; Chakrabarti et al., 2013) .",

The new viral species so far denominated feline morbillivirus (FeMV) was first identified in Hong Kong in 2009 (Woo et al., 2012) and associated with tubulo-interstitial nephritis (TIN). Following the first report in Hong Kong, FeMV was identified and isolated in cell culture in Japan (Furuya et al., 2014; Sagaguchi et al., 2014; Park et al., 2016; Sutummaporn et al., 2019) . Since then, several surveys have been conducted worldwide in order to unravel the epidemiology of this virus and the association with TIN. The virus was described in Germany, USA, South America, Turkey, UK and Malaysia (Sieg et al., 2015; Sharp et al., 2016; Darold et al., 2017; Yilmaz et al., 2017; McCallum et al., 2018; Mohd et al., 2019) . In Italy, FeMV was described for the first time by our group in 2015 in the municipality of Teramo, Abruzzi region, Central Italy. A 15-years old domestic stray cat diagnosed with severe nephropathy was hospitalized and found positive for FeMV RNA in the urine (Lorusso et al., 2015) . FeMV RNA was evidenced by quantitative real time PCR from the first day of observation up to cat's death which occurred 110 days later (De Luca et al., 2018) . FeMV was also recently identified in Northern Italy (Stranieri et al., 2019) . So far, a clear association between virus and TIN has been not yet demonstrated (Furuya et al., 2014; Sakaguchi et al., 2014; Park et al., 2016; Darold et al., 2017; Yilmaz et al., 2017; Stranieri et al., 2019) .",

Cats included in the study were divided into two groups: group A and group B. Specifically, group A was composed by 143 and 53 individuals admitted to the VUHs of Teramo and Bologna, respectively; group B was composed by 35 carcasses admitted at IZSAM for necropsy. In detail, urine (n = 196), whole blood (n = 196) and serum samples (n = 196) were collected from 196 live cats of group A; from carcasses of group B tissue samples (n = 385) including brain, cerebellum, heart, lung, intestine, stomach, liver, kidney, urinary bladder, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were collected during necropsy. Cats of group A were further classified in random household cats, originating from the two Italian regions under investigation and admitted with different clinical histories at the VUHs (subgroup RC, n = 127), and cats from three independent colonies (subgroup C, n = 69, which includes C1, n = 52; C2, n = 14 and C3, n = 3). Colonies C1, C2 and C3 were in Tortoreto, Martinsicuro and Mosciano Sant'Angelo, respectively, in the province of Teramo, Abruzzi region ( Fig. 1) . As far as we know, cats from colonies were not vaccinated against the major feline infectious diseases. Urine samples from all cats were collected by cystocentesis. Cats from colonies were hospitalized in groups of 5 at the VUH of Teramo. Cats of group A that tested positive for FeMV underwent haemato-biochemical analysis, urinalysis, urinary protein/creatinine ratio and symmetrical dimethylarginine (data not included). Carcasses of group B were also classified in random carcasses of household cats (originating from different areas of Abruzzi region, subgroup RCC, n = 28), and in carcasses from colonies (n = 7). This latter subgroup, CC, was formed by 5/7 carcasses from C1 and 2/7 from C2, and named CC1 and CC2, respectively. Groups classification has been listed, for clarity, in Table1.",

The prevalence of FeMV RNA positive urine samples was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in cats from colonies, compared to household cats. Reasonably, this difference is likely due to the higher probability of successful transmission occurring in cats of colonies. In this regard, young and middle aged cats of colonies are also the ones which mainly compose pattern 1 and 2, RNA+/Ab + and RNA+/Ab-, respectively, when virological and serological results were combined and analyzed together.

First, in silico analysis showed that forward primer and probe sequences of qPCR FeMV have one and two mismatches, respectively, with FeMV GT2, therefore we cannot exclude that qPCR FeMV negative samples were instead positive for FeMV GT2. This highly speculative scenario may have been responsible for the underestimation of FeMV prevalence in cats. All samples were indeed tested by this molecular assay developed prior to the discovery of FeMV GT2. Second, we did not perform NGS with nucleic acids purified from all qPCR FeMV negative samples, thus divergent viruses, including feline paramyxovirus (FPaV, Sieg et al., 2015) or potentially novel FeMV genotypes may have been missed. see  table  S2 ).

De Luca, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 240 (2020) 108484 Third, a complete virological follow up of cats from colonies was not performed for several reasons, including adoptions, spontaneous leaving and deaths by accidents with cars. A follow up was possible only from the 5 cats of colonies which succumbed 8-10 months later after the evidence of FeMV RNA intra vitam. Urine samples were still positive for FeMV RNA, confirming the long lasting shedding of FeMV (Sharp et al., 2016; De Luca et al., 2018) . Isolation of FeMV in cell cultures has been confirmed, in this study, to be, in general, difficult and time consuming (Sagaguchi et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2012) . Although in a recent study we described the isolation of two FeMV strains (Donato et al., 2019) showing clear viral syncytia at the first cell passage, CPE characteristic of all morbilliviruses, in this occasion it was possible to observe CPE (cell rounding, detachment and lysis) in FEA cells only from 1/33 FeMV RNA positive urine sample after two blind passages of ten days each. Syncytia were visible only at the 4 th passage but then CPE was not observed in the following passages. This apparent inefficiency in virus isolation may depend either from the biological characteristics of the virus possibly combined with the absence of a proper viable cell line, or from the timing of sample collection or from inappropriate sample storage. In general, in Morbillivirus diagnostics, viral isolation is still considered the \"gold standard\", even though efficient in vitro isolation and propagation of live virus is difficult to achieve. Hence, the chance that FeMV was an uncultivable virus, characteristics of many other viruses affecting domestic carnivores (Lorusso et al., 2008; Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2008; Decaro et al., 2014; Zaccaria et al., 2016) , was unlikely, even more in light of the successful isolation of FeMV performed by our study group and other worldwide. In this regard, isolation and propagation in cells of a FeMV close relative, CDV have been for decades difficult to be achieved (Appel et al., 1992; Metzler et al., 1984; Seki et al., 2003; Shin et al., 1997) . However less than twenty years ago, a Vero cell line stably expressing the canine signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM; CD150) was established and since then the efficiency of isolation and propagation of wild type CDVs strains greatly improved (Seki et al., 2003) . However, we were not able to observe CPE or to rescue live FeMV from Vero cells expressing canine SLAM (data not shown), unlikely other morbilliviruses such as dolphin morbillivirus which was successfully isolated on these cells (Peletto et al., 2018) . Thus, it would be beneficial to establish a homologous cell system stably expressing the feline SLAM and attempt isolation and propagation of FeMV RNA positive biological samples, including tissues (eg kidneys). Timing of sample collection may be also responsible for failure of virus isolation taking into account for the apparent chronic nature of FeMV infection evidenced by the long-lasting RNA shedding (De Luca et al., 2018; Sharp et al., 2016) and importantly by the low viral titres which are constantly detected by the used molecular assay. Low viral titres may account, per se, for failure of virus isolation. As evidenced for other viruses such as canine parvovirus type 2, virus isolation may give positive results only for few days post infection despite the high DNA viral titres present in the feaces of infected dogs likely due to antibodies in the intestinal lumen (and so the faeces) which may bind virions and prevent viral attachment to cell receptors (Desario et al., 2005; Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2017) . All blood samples tested negative for FeMV RNA including those of the 12 cats of pattern 2 (RNA+/Ab-) supposedly to be individuals in the early phase of infection as suggested by the absence of FeMV antibodies yet with very low viral titres in the urine. One could reasonably argue that successful isolation was achieved, by our group, at the first cell passage from two fresh urine samples which also showed low RNA titres (Donato et al., 2019) . Truth to be told, we do not have any explanations for this phenomenon. It is known that cell-to-cell spread of morbilliviruses in tissue culture was related to the capability of the virus to induce membrane fusion. H protein determines the extent and efficiency of cell-cell fusion, resulting in decisive influence on the CPE. We can only hypothesize the existence of FeMV strains with different in vitro properties and that each FeMV strain has different efficacy in fusion to host cells presenting a possible rationale why marked CPE is induced by some FeMV strains but not others as already speculated for different strains of CDV (von Messling et al., 2001; Lan et al., 2005) . In this regard, the two FeMV strains which were isolated (genotype 1, clade 1a; Donato et al., 2019) are almost identical within each other and more distantly related to FeMV Sheryl/2018 Italy (87% of nt identity). Proper sample storage may also play a role for successful isolation, with particular emphasis for morbilliviruses. As for this, we attempted isolation from fresh urine samples diluted 1:8 in MEM or after refrigeration at 4\u00b0C for a few days. This temperature was demonstrated to keep FeMV stable for at least twelve days (Koide et al., 2015) . Although performed with a limited number of carcasses, no statistically significant correlation was found between FeMV infection and renal lesions, including TIN. TIN was evidenced also in FeMV-negative cats. This finding, in line with recent reports from other study groups (Furuya et al., 2014; Sakaguchi et al., 2014; Park et al., 2016; Darold et al., 2017; Yilmaz et al., 2017; Stranieri et al., 2019; Mohd et al., 2019) , apparently seems to undervalue the importance of FeMV in feline medicine. FeMV RNA was also revealed in the urinary bladder of FeMV-positive carcasses as also evidenced by IHC in Fig. 6d . This suggests that FeMV may have also tropism for receptors (e.g. nectin4) present in transitional epithelium of the bladder, scenario already described for CDV (Pratakpiriya et al., 2017) . FeMV RNA could not be detected in the blood samples collected in this study, indicating that the viraemia might not be persistently observed in the infected cats or the viraemia duration was short. However, as suggested by the VHC, FeMV exhibits tropism for inflammatory cells residing in blood vessels of kidney and brain, airway epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and, with a lesser extent, the central nervous system. In this regard, FeMV-GT2 was also demonstrated to replicate in primary feline epithelial cells from different organs and was also able to infect primary feline T and B cells, monocytes and brain tissues (Sieg et al., 2019) . This aspect combined with the evidence of one cat showing low FeMV RNA titres in Fig. 7 . Attachment (brown color) of FeMV for feline tissues. Virus particles were evidenced on the surface of epithelial cells of bronchioles (black arrows, a) and adhered on the alveolar macrophages (b). Extensive attachment was observed in inflammatory cells residing within kidney tubuli and glomeruli (c, d respectively). A weak and scattered FeMV attachment was detected in granule cells (e) and in inflammatory cells in the lumen of blood vessels (f) in feline brain tissues. Virus histochemistry (VHC). Mayer's haematoxylin counterstain, final magnification X400. the brain tissue, may suggest a role of FeMV in pathological processes in other organs or districts during the acute phase of infection or in individuals with compromised immune system triggered by other pathogens whose presence was evidenced in carcasses analyzed of this study. Considering that only few organs collected from carcasses tested positive for FeMV RNA, generally kidneys, a likely evidence of chronic infection, in vivo experimental infection of the natural host or of a susceptible animal model is warranted in order to examine the pathogenesis of FeMV, viral tropism and immune response during the early stages of infection. The analysis of pathogenesis and viral kinetics may be also beneficial for the development of a targeted sampling in field conditions. Moreover, in order to disentangle the role of FeMV in coinfection processes, we strongly believe that FeMV specific molecular tests are needed to be included in the diagnostic workflow of cats in clinical practice.",
