            "text": "There is great demand for cheap disposable gowns in the cost-conscious healthcare sector. Over the last few years various strategies for developing singleuse fabrics have evolved, using spunbonded-meltblown-spunbonded (SMS), spunlace hydroentangled, triplex or bicomponent fi brous webs, with or without chemical fi nishes to resist liquid penetration. Disposable SMS fabric can be formed by sandwiching an inner thermoplastic meltblown microfi brous web between two outer nonwoven webs of substantially continuous thermoplastic spunbonded fi lament, where the spunbond layer provides strength and dimensional stability while the meltblown layer provides the barrier property. The microfi brous nonwoven meltblown layers provide a barrier impervious to pathogens in the composite nonwoven fabric. However, various surgical procedures entail an extent of splashing, liquid strike-through, aerosol generation, or applied pressure, and can be of long duration. Care should therefore be taken in selecting single-or multiple-use gowns during specifi c procedures. Leonas and Jinkins (1997) compared eight commercially available surgical gowns, among which fi ve were disposable nonwovens and three were reusable woven fabrics. Four of the fi ve nonwoven fabrics investigated were made from polypropylene-based SMS nonwoven fabrics and hydroentangled wood pulp and polyester of spun-lace fabrics. SMS nonwovens showed better effi ciency in preventing the transmission of S. aureus and E. coli in a saline solution, as compared to woven fabrics. Lankester et al. (2002) studied the extent of bacterial penetration through disposable gowns made of spun-bonded polyester and wood pulp, as compared to reusable woven polyester gowns; the results clearly showed a comparatively inferior barrier property for reusable woven polyester fabrics. Taken together, as a very generalized conclusion (McCullough and Schoenberger 1991), polypropylene-based gowns (for example, 97-100% polypropylene, SMS laminates) provided the greatest protection against blood strike-through and microbial penetration. Gowns composed of a single layer of nonwoven fabric provided the next highest level of effectiveness. Reusable gowns composed of 100% woven cotton provided a minimal level of protection.",

Pathogenic bacteria present on the scalp and skin are reported to have caused epidemics (Dineen and Drusin 1973) ; it is therefore highly important that effi cient coverings are available during surgery. All over the world, major care is being taken to reduce patient-to-patient transmission of resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus . Nonwoven products remain the most common choice for protection, sometimes with an additional active coating. Surgical facemasks are usually composed of three layers of an SMS nonwoven fabric, where the meltblown material acts as a fi lter. The design of most surgical masks includes three pleats/folds to allow the user to expand the mask to cover the area under the nose and under the chin. This design may be suffi cient to protect the wearer in dusty environments, but these products are not particularly effective in offering protection from airborne pandemic diseases or in environments full of aerosols.",

            "text": "Mammalian embryos and some amphibians can spontaneously regenerate their tissues after severe injury. Adult mammals typically recover from such injuries by a 'repair' process, eventually developing scars. At the price of wound closure, severe wound contraction and scar tissue formation often cause serious clinical complications and life-long disfi gurement for the survivor. During healing of skin wounds, a group of contractile cells (myofi broblasts) migrate in the wound bed. These cells express cytoplasmic bundles of microfi laments (stress fi bres), using which they apply contractile forces to shrink the injured site. Eventually the wound site is fi lled by an irregular dense collagen fi brous matrix (Tomasek et al. 2002) . When a nonwoven matrix is implanted within the wound bed, those contractile cells migrate randomly, following the randomly oriented fi brous architecture of the nonwoven matrix. This can result in disorientation of major axes of contractile cells and the disruption of organized cell contraction at the edges of the wound. Thus, randomization of individual force vectors of contractile cells will reduce rapid contraction of wound edges ( Fig. 9 .1 ). A signifi cant reduction in the number of contractile cells has also been reported when the wound is treated with a nonwoven scaffold during dermis regeneration (Murphy et al. 1990 ). Despite detailed understanding of wound healing mechanisms, scarless healing in adult humans still remains a utopian concept, but extensive research is ongoing to develop bioresponsive fi brous material, such as collagenglycosaminoglycan bicomponent fi brous web, which will be able to inhibit scar formation and cause controlled contraction (Yannas 2013) . Many basic composite nonwoven dressings are commercially available and are regularly used. These are relatively inexpensive, readily available, and versatile enough to treat several types of wounds. The simplest form is as a single nonwoven layer with a transparent waterproof backing (generally polyurethane fi lm), which forms an attachment to the skin to keep the dressing in place while the nonwoven absorbent layer contains medication to promote healing.",

For the purpose of bone regeneration, attempts have been made to develop fi bre-reinforced polymer foam. The reinforcing effect of fi bres within a matrix becomes effective when fi bres are uniformly distributed throughout the matrix, the degree of fi bre-polymer contact is maximized and fi bre-fi bre contact is kept at a minimum. Generally, this type of scaffold is made using a solvent-casting technique. Mandal et al. (2012) attempted to develop a silk-fi bre-reinforced scaffold to simulate the compressive modulus of bone. Interfacial bonding between the silk fi bre and the silk matrix resulted in an compressive modulus of 10 MPa in hydrated conditions.

Bioartifi cial liver support systems based on hollow fi bre technology have undergone clinical trials and have been demonstrated to be promising (Watanabe et al. 1997 ). In this system, hepatocytes are placed inside a chambered cartridge. When patients' blood is passed through, cells process toxins from the blood and synthesize proteins and metabolites. This plasma is then returned to the patient's body. In such systems, oxygenated plasma fl ows through the fi bre capillary, but hepatocytes are attached in extracapillary spaces. As a result, the oxygen supply to the hepatocytes is inadequate because the oxygenbinding ability of plasma is less than one-tenth of that of whole blood. This limited oxygen supply leads to insuffi cient function of hepatocytes. Li et al. (2006) used a roller pump in which polysulfone hollow fi bres were spirally wound with polytetrafl uoroethylene nonwoven fabric. Nonwoven fabric allowed attachment and aggregation of hepatocytes, and semipermeable membranes of hollow fi bres served as gas exchangers and immuno-protective barriers. Whole blood passed through the intra-luminal space of the hollow fi bres and was exposed to the hepatocytes for effective oxygen supply, CO 2 removal and exchange of metabolic waste and nutrients. Hence, the diffusion distance was reduced and mass exchange took place akin to that in the sinusoids of the liver parenchyma.",

Nonwoven meshes should be easy to use in both laparoscopic and open hernia repair. Fibrous capsule formation, cellular attachment and mesh contraction result in the recurrence of hernias in most patients. Woven polypropylene meshes frequently form adhesion and fi stula when transplanted intra-peritoneally. Polypropylene nonwoven fabric has been demonstrated to overcome such complications due to its microporous structure giving a high capacity for tissue in-growth and integration (Langenbach et al. 2003) . Raptis et al. (2011) implanted woven as well as nonwoven polypropylene fabrics into 12 pigs to compare ease of incorporation and removal by histology and adhesion formation 90 days after implantation. Intraperitoneally, woven polypropylene fabric became fully peritonealized, but generated thick and abundant adhesions. Interestingly, polypropylene nonwoven fabric became fully peritonealized and generated only very thin adhesions, and to a strikingly lesser extent. Woven meshes formed comparatively dense adhesions that could only be detached with greater diffi culty than with nonwoven meshes (Raptis et al. 2011) . Weyhe et al. (2006) and Dubova et al. (2007) investigated the infl ammatory response in rats during abdominal wall reconstruction using polypropylene fabrics, at different time points after surgery. One group of rats received heavy woven polypropylene meshes with macro-dimensional pores, and the other group of rats received light nonwoven fabrics with micro-dimensional pores. A more severe infl ammatory reaction was noticed in the group which received nonwoven fabrics. Interestingly, however, Dubova et al. (2007) noticed less intense fi brosis in the nonwoven fabric, with uniform tissue growth after 28 days, while Weyhe et al. (2006) reported a decline in the concentration of infl ammatory cells over time in both groups. Fibrous tissue formation took place in both types of hernia mesh after 45 days, with no statistical difference between the groups.",
