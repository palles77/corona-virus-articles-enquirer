These guidelines, which outline specific strategies for prevention and control of influenza in acute care facilities, supplement CDC's 2008 infection control recommendations (4). Despite these strategic references, at least 48 cases of influenza A (H1N1) strain have been reported among health care personnel since the initial outbreak, indicating that compliance with the CDC's recommendations may be lower than desired (5) . Although there is limited and controversial evidence regarding the effectiveness of either surgical or N95 masks in reducing transmission of the influenza virus, studies of occupational exposures during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak suggest that the wearing of either surgical or N95 masks might be protective in the health care setting (6 -10) . A recent study on the use of surgical masks compared to N95 masks by nurses in Canada demonstrated similar rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection (11) . Influenza infection control is particularly important in the emergency department (ED) because both index cases and more severe cases are expected to present to the ED, and the phenomenon of ED crowding continues to increase at an alarming rate across the United States (12) .",

No other infection control interventions geared toward influenza were implemented in the ED during the study period, beyond routine processes. A potential confounder to our study is the impact of public health recommendations after the novel H1N1 outbreak in April 2009. To minimize this effect, for the 2008 -2009 influenza season we did not include cases that presented after the onset of media coverage of the novel influenza H1N1 virus. This was done to avoid confounding the data due to an increased public and staff awareness of influenza. Thus, we only included patients through April 24, 2009, which was before release of recommendations to ED staff obtained from the CDC and Department of Health.

Mortality for hospitalacquired influenza in most acute care facilities is 16%, and as high as 33-60% in transplant intensive care units (15) . As the incubation period for influenza can be as short as 2 days, realistically, there is no meaningful time to introduce effective control measures once the infection has been transmitted (16) .

Educational interventions for the prevention of nosocomial infections, including hand washing before patient contact and wearing a mask around patients, have shown good results, with nurses and patient care technicians having the greatest improvement in compliance (22) (23) (24) . Other studies have shown that compliance with isolation procedures after standardized lectures and videos alone was poor, but improved after the institution of smaller, more intensive in-service sessions tailored to individual departments and provided during multiple shifts (25) .

Additional challenges to compliance include the presence of trainees rotating through the department, and an increased reliance on traveling nursing staff who may not be familiar with local policy or may be overwhelmed with other tasks. In the event of a severe pandemic during which 30% of the health care workforce is expected to become ill, compliance with transmission-based precautions will become increasingly dif- ficult due to shortages in health care providers, nursing staff, and environmental services staff to provide cleaning and disinfection. Limiting factors to compliance also include logistical problems such as the number of private rooms available in the ED, the available supplies of personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, and the volume of patients in the ED. For example, one challenge during the SARS epidemic was fulfilling increased demand for personal protective equipment and biohazard bags (36) . Policies to enforce strict isolation are costly and time intensive and these policies may prevent health care workers from entering those patient rooms with the same frequency due to the burden of mask and gown use, with a potential impact on patient care and satisfaction (37) . Clearly, there is a need for solutions to the many challenges faced in properly employing CDC droplet precautions in the ED, including effective educational strategies.",

One recommendation is to empower and encourage these non-physician health providers, using triage protocols, to deploy droplet precautions, such as providing patients who have recognized symptoms of respiratory infections with a surgical mask and assigning them a private room. Other recommendations during busy influenza weeks include cohorting patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) in a holding area when private rooms are not available, and visible signage at patient check-in requesting patients' voluntary use of surgical masks (provided for those patients with symptoms of ILI [e.g., cough, fever, myalgia]). Ideally, these measures would be supplemented with educational campaigns for staff, patients, and visitors, focusing on appropriate infection control procedures, especially hand washing and proper use of masks. Many permutations of strategies such as these are still being used in regions that were affected by SARS (28) . Active monitoring of compliance by supervisors may also improve adherence to infection control precautions.",

Further research should be undertaken to determine the factors that increase transmission of influenza in the ED setting as well as obstacles to providing appropriate isolation of patients with ILI to promote guidelines for the most efficient and cost-effective means to decrease transmission in the ED setting. Because overcrowding increases patient proximity and may prevent early identification and isolation of patients with ILI, future studies should focus on the effect of ED boarding on droplet-and airborne-based transmission in the ED.",

A total of 711 influenza swabs were ordered in the ED for the 2007-2008 season and 931 swabs were ordered during the 2008 -2009 season. During the 2007-2008 influenza season, the ED had 129 swab-confirmed cases of influenza in the study period and droplet precautions were used in 38 (29%) cases. Within the subgroup of patients who were moved to the hallway or Radiology, defined precautions were used in 7 (7%) cases. During the following 2008 -2009 influenza season, through April 24, 2009, the ED had 112 swab-confirmed cases of influenza, and infection control precautions were used in 50 (45%) cases. For the subgroup of patients who were moved to the hallway or Radiology, infection control precautions were used in 20 (24%) cases. Overall compliance with transmission precautions increased between the two seasons, from 29% to 45%, with a p-value of 0.015. Compliance with precautions for patients moved to the hallway or radiology increased from 7% to 24%, with a p-value of 0.001.
