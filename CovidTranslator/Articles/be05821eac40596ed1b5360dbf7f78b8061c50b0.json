We expressed both full-length HeV N, (HeV N FL ), and a C-terminal truncated form, (HeV N CORE ), using a bacterial heterologous expression system. Both HeV N constructs were engineered with an N-terminal His x6 tag, and purified using a combination of immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Purified recombinant HeV N proteins self-assembled into soluble higher order oligomers as determined by SEC and negative-stain transmission electron microscopy. Both HeV N proteins were highly immuno-reactive with sera from animals and humans infected with either HeV or the closely related Nipah virus (NiV), but displayed no immuno-reactivity towards sera from animals infected with a non-pathogenic paramyxovirus (CedPV), or animals receiving Equivac \u00d2 (HeV G glycoprotein subunit vaccine), using a Luminex-based multiplexed microsphere assay.",

EID events are dominated by zoonoses (>60%), characterized by ''species-jumping pathogens'', the majority of which originate in wildlife and are able to replicate in humans [1] . The most pathogenic of the zoonotic diseases are those caused by RNA viruses, which have an unmatched ability to replicate in the new host species' cytoplasm [2, 3] . Bats have been identified or implicated as the natural host reservoir for an increasing number of new and often deadly zoonotic viruses [4, 5] .

Since then there has been more than 48 sporadic Hendra virus outbreaks in Australia, killing four of the seven humans known to be infected with the virus and many horses [9] . In 1998, a deadly outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs and abattoir workers in Malaysia was caused by the very closely related henipavirus species, Nipah virus (NiV) [4, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Outbreaks of NiV continue to occur throughout South-East Asia, India and Bangladesh. Both HeV and NiV are highly pathogenic in a wide variety of mammals, with mortality rates approaching 60%.

Our colleagues have recently identified the existence of a closely related, but non-pathogenic henipavirus; Cedar virus (CedPV), which is also transmitted by pteropid bat species [14] . Laboratory studies utilizing guinea pigs have demonstrated that CedPV can replicate in these animals, develop neutralizing antibodies, but remain clinically well [14] . The absence of therapeutic treatments for HeV and NiV, together with the susceptibility of humans to both viruses and their high virulence, has led to the classification of HeV and NiV as Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) pathogens [8, 9, 15] . A vaccine for HeV (Equivac \u00d2 ) has recently been developed for use in horses that is effective at protecting them from HeV infection, breaking the only known transmission mechanism from bats to humans [9, [16] [17] [18] .",

            "text": "HeV and NiV are members of the genus Henipavirus, and belong to the RNA virus family Paramyxoviridae, order Mononegavirales (non-segmented negative sense single-stranded RNA viruses (nsNSRV)). The close relatedness of both HeV and NiV is further demonstrated by the observation that antibodies produced against one virus can neutralize the other in serum neutralization assays, albeit with reduced efficiency [16] . The genomic RNA from HeV and NiV along with other nsNSRV (e.g. Measles virus) encodes the six major viral structural proteins; nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), attachment glycoprotein (G), and the large protein (L) (RNA polymerase) [8, 11, 19, 20] , the most abundant protein being the N protein [21] [22] [23] . The size of both the HeV genome (18.234 kilobases) and NiV genome (18.246 kilobases) are considerably larger than other paramyxoviruses (average size 15.6 kilobases), and fit the ''rule of six'', which stipulates that the paramyxovirus RNA polymerase will only replicate efficiently if the viral genome is a multiple of six nucleotides (6n + 0 nucleotides) [20, 24, 25] . Interestingly, the length of these genomes is somewhat closer to the length of the genomes of family Filoviridae viruses (18.9-19.1 kilobases), which includes Ebola and Marburg viruses [26, 27] . The N protein of NSRV forms a complex with viral RNA (N-RNA), which then associates with P and L to form a stable ribo-nucleocapsid protein complex (RNP) required for the transcription and replication of viral RNA [28, 29] .",

Control microspheres for HeV, NiV and CedPV soluble-glycoproteins (sG) were coupled by the same method and the assay carried out as described [32] . Briefly, the assay was performed in 96-well micro-titre plates where 1000 coupled microspheres were added to each test well. The beads were blocked with 2% skim milk and mixed with the test sera diluted 1:100 in phosphate-buffed saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich). The bound antibodies were then detected using biotinylated Protein A (Pierce) and biotinylated Protein G (Pierce) and streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Qiagen). The beads were interrogated by the lasers in a BioPlex \u00d2 200 suspension array system (BioRad) and the results recorded as the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of 100 beads.",

The C-terminally truncated HeV N CORE construct was expressed at levels at least 30% lower than HeV N FL . We have attempted to improve the expression levels and the solubility level of the HeV N CORE construct by changing the expression media to TB and reducing the expression temperature to 18\u00b0C. The expression level and solubility of a truncated version of the HeV N protein; HeV N CORE in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has also been reported to be lower than the full-length construct [34] .

Similar observations have previously been made for NiV N expressed in E. coli and negative stain EM analysis indicated the presence of nucleocapsid-like herringbone particles of different lengths, morphologically resembling the structure of RNPs isolated from virus particles [23, 37] . EM analysis of HeV and NiV N expressed in S. cerevisiae also demonstrated that these proteins are able to form nucleocapsid-like herringbone structures and rings [34] . Detailed biophysical characterization studies have been undertaken on the N protein of another paramyxovirus, Measles virus (MeV) [38] [39] [40] . Full-length MeV N protein (MeV N FL ) was expressed and purified from E. coli, C-terminally truncated MeV N (MeV N CORE ) was prepared by limited proteolysis [38] . Negative-stain EM studies on these proteins revealed that MeV N CORE polymerizes into very long and extremely rigid helices [29, 38] , similar to the structures we observed for our HeV N CORE . Interestingly, their studies demonstrated that MeV N FL protein assembled into short and much less rigid helices or mostly only ring structures as we also observed with the HeV N FL images. They postulated that the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail was responsible for the restricted of polymerization N monomers in full length N proteins [38] .",

This suggests that the oligomerization of the paramyxovirus N protein is maintained by intra-or intermolecular, non-covalent bonds or by the viral or host expression system nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) or both [23, 41, 42] . Amino acid alignments identified four highly conserved hydrophobic regions in Paramyxoviridae N proteins [43] . The construction of a series of amino acid deletion mutants has enabled the identification of four small continuous stretches of amino acids responsible for the self-assembly of the N protein [37] . The removal of any of these domains prevented oligomerization of N monomers; however, the replacement of these deleted regions with the same conserved amino acid region from Newcastle Disease Virus N protein restored oligomerization [37] . These studies further demonstrated that the deletion of more than 129 amino acids from the C-terminus of the NiV N protein inhibited the formation of herringbone-like capsid molecules (NiV N and NiV N ), whereas the deletion of less than 128 amino acids did not prevent oligomerization or capsid formation (NiV N ) [37] . Contrary to those observations, our results indicated that HeV N CORE(1-402) is able to still able to form oligomers even with the deletion 130 amino acids, indicating the construct contains all the necessary amino acid residues for self-assembly. Detailed biophysical validation techniques such as analytical ultracentrifugation and multi-angle light scattering are needed to confirm whether HeV N FL and HeV N CORE exist as a stable multimer in solution.",

Further studies on MeV N protein have indicated that the hypervariable C-terminal tail appears to be at the surface of the N assembly with a structure that is not well-visualized by electron microscopy [38, 39] . This observation is also a potential indicator that the accessibility of the C-terminal tail region increases the susceptibility of the domain to proteolysis and likelihood of intracellular proteolysis when over-expressed in E. coli or other heterologous expression systems. These observations have been made for preparations of HeV N FL protein and NiV N FL expressed in E. coli and S. cerevisiae [34, 35, 44, 45] . Utilizing bioinformatics proteolysis prediction tools, it has been demonstrated that the proteolytic degradation of E. coli expressed NiV N could be reduced by the choice and concentration of specific serine protease inhibitors [35] .

The current assays utilize the vaccine antigen (HeV sG) and as such are unable to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). The gold standard diagnostic assay is the virus neutralization test which is also ineffective in determining if an animal has been infected or vaccinated. The Luminex assay results from this study indicate that either format of recombinant HeV N expressed and purified could be used equally well to detect antibodies in HeV-infected animals, as well as those infected with the closely related NiV, but are able to differentiate from other known henipaviruses (Cedar Virus (CedPV)), providing an important component of a DIVA assay. The low-level immunoreactivity seen with the HeV N CORE to normal horse, vaccinated horse, normal human and normal pig and to the vaccinated horse sera for the HeV N FL is most likely due to cross-reactivity to related paramyxoviruses, since the N protein of paramyxoviruses is highly conserved. There has only been limited optimization of the antigen coupling process in this assay and further adjustment may also increase the differentiation of positive and negative HeV sera lowering the threshold for negative sera. These proteins would need to be tested against large numbers of normal sera and against control sera for other paramyxoviruses to determine the levels of cross reactivity prior to their validation in DIVA assays. Despite this low-level reactivity, the promising results from the Luminex assay indicate that both forms of recombinant HeV N would be valuable antigens to differentiate animals which had been naturally infected with HeV from those vaccinated with the HeV soluble Glycoprotein (sG) vaccine. Additionally, they will also be valuable reagents for serological surveillance of henipaviruses in wildlife and domestic livestock when used along with the sG in multiplex assays. When used in combination they will provide an opportunity for the identification of antibodies to related viruses that would otherwise be missed by the specificity of the sG proteins.",

Furthermore, monitoring the SEC profile at A 260 demonstrated that the higher order oligomers of both the HeV N FL and HeV N CORE retained the ability to bind E. coli nucleic acids in vitro, immunoblots with the anti-His x6 antibody confirmed that the proteins in these peaks were HeV N. TEM analysis revealed both forms of HeV N assembled into helical ring-like structures that very closely resembled paramyxovirus-like particles Using a Luminex bead-based immunoassay, we were able to demonstrate both recombinant HeV N FL and HeV N CORE were highly immuno-reactive towards sera from animals and humans infected with either HeV or its' very close relative, NiV, but not with sera from animals infected with a non-pathogenic Henipavirus, CedPV. Furthermore, by incorporating this antigen into the current assays we are now able to distinguish between animals infected with HeV (or NiV) and those vaccinated against this virus. The ability to identify infected from vaccinated animals will be a very useful tool for undertaking epidemiological studies and understanding infection and transmission dynamics of HeV between its' natural host reservoir pteropid bats and spillover targets domestic livestock and humans. The availability of correctly folded recombinant HeV N proteins, will also allow us to enhance the rapid, specific, and ultra-sensitive detection systems that do not require the use of live virus for detecting specific HeV antibodies in virus neutralization assays.

Immunoreactivity of recombinant henipavirus nucleocapsid protein and soluble glycoprotein towards different anti-sera from infected and non-infected organisms in a Luminex bead-based assay. Detection of antibodies to recombinant henipavirus N and sG proteins in sera from animals and humans infected naturally (NI) or laboratory infected (LI) with, either HeV, NiV or CedPV, and horses receiving Equivac \u00d2 HeV vaccine (Vac). Non-infected humans and animals were designated normal. HeV N FL and HeV N CORE together HeV, NiV and CedPV sG were coupled to individual sets of Luminex beads. Binding of specific antibodies were detected using biotinylated Protein A and biotinylated Protein G and streptavidin-phycoerythrin. The results were recorded as the Mean Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) of 100 beads.",
