In part, the predominant research focus on immune-mediated neurotoxicity is a consequence of the following common (but incorrect) presumptions: n The nervous system played little to no role in regulating immune responses and was thus passive and always on the receiving end of neuroimmune interactions. n Immune functions were primarily aimed toward pathogen defense and were thus always cytotoxic. n Neuronal function was incompatible with exposure to activated immune cells and their pro-inflammatory products.",

Specifically, we will detail multiple mechanisms by which the nervous system regulates and directs immune function toward what is needed and tolerated by the nervous system. Identification of multiple regulatory points also suggests multiple sites that can be disrupted by pathogens, toxins or genetic abnormalities to trigger, facilitate and/ or exacerbate the onset and progression of classic neurodegenerative disorders. Surprisingly, targeted disruptions in T-cell and macrophage functions have revealed previously unknown essential roles of the immune system in maintaining cognitive function even in the absence of overt infection and injury (Schwartz & Kipnis, 2011; Dilger & Johnson, 2008; Derecki et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2010) . For example, CD4\ue031T-cell deficiency in murine models leads to decreased performance in tests of murine learning and memory (Derecki et al., 2010) . In addition, targeted disruption of Hoxb8 in macrophage lineages is sufficient to trigger onset of obsessive-compulsive-like behaviors in otherwise healthy mice free of pathogenic infection or injury (Chen et al., 2010) . Supplementation of Hoxb8-deficient mice with wild-type bone marrow was sufficient to restore normal behavior (Chen et al., 2010) .",

T-cell-dependent control of the human pathogen Toxoplasma gondi (T. gondii) illustrates that the sustained chronic influx of activated, IFN\u03b3-producing lymphocytes into the CNS can be well tolerated without causing overt neurodegeneration (Ferguson, 2009; Wilson et al., 2010) . T. gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan able to infect all mammals. Humans generally become infected due to ingestion of undercooked infected meat or exposure to T. gondii sporozoites in soil. Once an individual is infected by T. gondii, the parasite invades all tissues in the body. An individual's immune system is able to rapidly clear the fast-replicating tachyzoites from most tissues, but cannot clear all forms of the parasite from the body. Instead, T. gondii evades elimination by the immune system from sites of tissue infection by entering the latent bradyzoite tissue cyst stage of its life cycle. Lifelong influx of interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3)-producing T-cells into tissues is required to prevent emergence of the cytotoxic tachyzoites from latent tissue cysts.",

In adult humans with competent immune systems, infection by this common pathogen is usually benign. By contrast, in humans with severe immunodeficiency (such as that caused by HIV or chemotherapy), the failure of sufficient numbers of IFN\u03b3-producing T-cells to infiltrate the CNS is accompanied by emergence of cytotoxic tachyzoites from tissue cysts and widespread necrotizing damage to the CNS. Left untreated, this condition can be fatal (Ferguson, 2009; Wilson et al., 2010) . Despite the presence of IFN\u03b3-producing T-cells and activated macrophages in their brains, immune-competent individuals infected with T. gondii do not display overt clinical or histologic signs of neuropathology such as those associated with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease despite chronic CNS inflammation (Carson et al., 2006; Dilger & Johnson, 2008; Ferguson, 2009; Wilson et al., 2010) . It is possible that subtle changes in brain function result from this type of chronic inflammation. However, the behavior of the population as a whole in regions with high prevalence of T. gondii infections clearly indicates that high levels of cognitive and motor brain function can be maintained in the presence of at least one common form of lifelong brain inflammation.",

However, this does not minimize the potential neurologic damage and clinical dysfunction caused by aberrant or dysregulated neuroimmune interactions. In particular, CNS function is dependent on large populations of post-mitotic neurons and experiencedriven formation of synaptic pathways. Therefore, it is vulnerable to functional disruption caused by pathogen-mediated damage in the absence of sufficient immune responses, as well as by immune-mediated damage in the presence of overly robust immune responses. However, as in the case of suspected immune-mediated triggers of autism, it is not always clear if the neuronal dysfunction is caused by too few, too many or just the wrong types of neuroimmune interactions (Dilger & Johnson, 2008; Brynskikh et al., 2008) .",

The primary consequence of somatic recombination is that all TCRs or BCRs expressed by an individual T-or B-cell will have the identical antigenic binding pocket.

Experience shapes the antigenic repertoire recognized by the adaptive immune system to fit the pathogens most likely to be encountered in the host's environment. Only the few lymphocytes that express receptors able to recognize an infecting pathogen will proliferate and become activated. The immune system also \"adapts\" to any mutations that the pathogen may introduce to evade the host's immune system. As new antigenic targets are revealed by a pathogen, they trigger expansion and activation of additional lymphocyte populations. Because lymphocytes are long-lived, each pathogen encounter causes long-term increases in the frequency of memory lymphocytes able to attack the pathogen if re-encountered. Upon antigen re-encounter, memory lymphocytes have a lower activation threshold and a faster rate of activation.

When cells are infected by an intracellular pathogen, the cell's protein synthetic machinery produces both self-and pathogen peptides. As a result, self-antigens and pathogen antigens will be loaded into the pocket of the MHC class I molecule as it travels to the plasma membrane. Once activated by antigen presentation, the functional response of CD8 T-cells is to kill the infected and/or severely damaged MHC class I-expressing cell (Lo et al., 1999; Carson et al., 2006; Siffrin et al., 2007) . Consequently, activated CD8\ue031T-cells are also referred to as cytolytic lymphocytes (CTLs). Nearly all cells including CNS neurons can be induced to produce MHC class I. However, it should be noted that neurons are not as readily induced to express MHC class I as other cells in the CNS, such as oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. It is speculated that the much higher resistance of neurons to expression of MHC class I is an adaptive measure to prevent CD8\ue031 T-cell triggered lysis of infected but still functional CNS neurons (Carson et al., 2006; Dilger & Johnson, 2008; Siffrin et al., 2007) .",

Several other CNS cells have been reported to express some forms of MHC. For example, CNS neurons express non-classical MHC molecules that are demonstrated to play roles in the maturation of the visual system. However, these non-classical MHC molecules are not recognized to have antigen presentation functions. Astrocytes in glial cultures do express functional MHC class II. Because astrocytic expression of MHC class II within the intact CNS is not detected in healthy or disease conditions, this in vitro expression appears to be an aberrant consequence of culture.

Based on their production of factors that determine and support specific activation states in innate immune cells and B-cells, antigen-activated T-cells CD4\ue031T-cells are referred to as T helper (Th) cells. CD4\ue031T-cells phenotypes range from pro-inflammatory (Th1, Th17), humoral (Th2, Th9, ThFH), and anti-inflammatory (Th3, T regulatory [Treg]) to even anergized (permanently inactivated) phenotypes ( Figure 33 -1). IFN\u03b3-producing Th1 CD4\ue031T-cells promote myeloid cells to develop classical activation state (also termed M1) characterized by enhanced microbicidal and tumoricidal abilities, high expression levels of INOS, CD40, MHC class I, MHC class II and robust secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, IL-23 and TNF-\u03b1) (Colton & Wilcock, 2010; Gordon & Martinez, 2010; Graeber & Streit, 2010; Yang et al., 2010) . Conversely, Il-4-and IL-13-producing Th2 CD4\ue031T-cells are not only essential for B-cell activation, Th2 cells also promote alternative activation states (also termed M2a and 2b) in myeloid cells. Alternative activation states are characterized by expression of macrophage mannose receptor (also referred to as CD206), YM1, stabilin-1 and arginase I. Alternatively activated cells are functionally associated with enhanced phagocytosis, tissue repair and parasite elimination. Finally, Il-10-, TGF\u03b2-producing Th3 cells and Treg cells promote regulatory activation states (also termed M2c) in myeloid cells. These states are characterized by production of molecules associated with tissue repair and immunosuppression (Colton & Wilcock, 2010; Gordon & Martinez, 2010; Graeber & Streit, 2010; Yang et al., 2010) .",

Thus, classically activated macrophages and dendritic cells preferentially promote Th1 and Th17 differentiation of CD4\ue031T-cells, while alternatively activated myeloid cells preferentially promote differentiation of T-cells with humoral and anti-inflammatory phenotypes. To summarize, the interactive cross-regulation between the innate and adaptive immune systems can appear circular, resulting in either beneficial or detrimental outcomes for the host. This cross-regulatory aspect of innate and adaptive immunity can lead to increased refinement of the immune response such that the pathogens (and thus all antigenic and alarm stimuli) are eliminated and immune resolution and tissue repair programs are effectively launched. Alternatively, chronic inflammation results if the pathogen or pathogen associated antigenic stimuli (such as unclearable pathogenic toxins or cross-reactive self-antigens) cannot be eliminated. Chronic inflammation can be highly detrimental to tissue function due to immune-mediated cytotoxicity and dysregulated fibrotic repair.",

In the uninfected healthy individual, these immature dendritic cells and tissue macrophages routinely contribute to tissue homeostasis by the phagocytosis of cell debris. In doing so, these tissue APCs capture self-antigens and load them into their MHC class II molecules. Once activated by phagocytosis, these antigenpresenting cells migrate to the lymph nodes draining each tissue. In the lymph node, these short-lived APCs move among the large number of T-cells within the lymph node, testing if any have TCRs able to recognize their captured self-antigen. Soluble tissue antigens also reach lymph nodes by passive drainage along the lymphatic system associated with most tissues. MHC-expressing dendritic cells take up these antigens and present them to T-cells within the lymph node. If these antigen-presenting cells do not encounter other activating stimuli such as PAMPs or pro-inflammatory cytokines, they will express MHC but no other co-stimulatory factors. Consequently, they will only provide what is referred to as \"signal 1\" to a T-cell, with the result that the T-cell is permanently inactivated. To restate, mature na\u00efve T-cells activated by their TCR and no other co-stimulatory signals will become permanently inactivated (referred to as anergized). This ongoing process of presenting self-antigens in the absence of alarm signals, resulting in the inactivation of autoreactive T-cells, is termed peripheral tolerance.",

Norepinephrine (NE) is the primary neurotransmitter released from sympathetic neurons. Most lymphocytes express a wide variety of neurotransmitter receptors. However, the level of expression differs as a function of activation state and cell type. For example, the \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (receptor for NE) is expressed at much higher levels in Th1 than in Th2 CD4\ue031T-cells. Thus, \u03b22 adrenergic agonists preferentially induce cAMP elevations in Th1 CD4\ue031T-cells over Th2 CD4\ue031T-cells and play a larger role in regulating Th1 function. The extent to which the nervous system can direct and shape adaptive immune responses is illustrated by studies quantifying the effects of denervating the lymphoid organs by mechanical or chemical methods. For example, in animal models with normal innervation, Th1 CD4\ue031T-cells promote B-cell production of IgG1 antibody isotypes, while Th2 CD4\ue031Tcells promote B-cell production of IgG2a antibody isotypes. Denervation of the spleen leads to increased ratios of IgG2a to IgG1, indicative of an increase in Th2 CD4\ue031T-cell responses and consistent with the in vitro observations of NE-mediated regulation of Th1 function. In vitro studies have also shown that direct stimulation of the \u03b22 adrenergic receptor on B-cells increases the propensity to produce immunoglobulin (Ig) E, which is associated with allergic (type 1 hypersensitivity) and anti-parasitic immune responses (Nance et al., 2007; Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2010) . Consistent with these observations, in animal models contusion models of spinal cord injury (SCI) have illustrated that altering neuronal activity to lymphoid organs alters V.

High-level SCI (at thoracic level 3) caused sustained increases in splenic NE along with impaired antibody synthesis and elevated splenocyte apoptosis that could be reversed by using \u03b22 adrenergic receptor blockers (Lucin et al., 2007) . Furthermore, impaired antibody production could be mimicked with low level SCI (thoracic level 9) with a beta2AR agonist. The effects of denervation are not limited to B-cells. In vitro and in vivo data reveal that NE inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory molecules such as TNF by lymphoid macrophages and dendritic cells. Innervation even affects the generation of mature lymphocytes. Seizure-associated changes in the sympathetic innervation of the thymus decrease the proliferative capacity of the lymphocytes being produced as well as changing the ratios of CD4\ue031to CD8\ue031T-cells that successfully mature (Nance et al., 2007; Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2010; Held et al., 2010; Lucin et al., 2007; Carson & Lo, 2007) .

Dendritic cells are considered to be the professional APCs of the immune system and critical for the initial activation and polarization of T-cell responses (see above). As a function of maturation, dendritic cells progress from being highly phagocytic cells with lower expression of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules to being relatively nonphagocytic cells with very high expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules (Lo et al., 1999) . It is highly notable that coincident with their maturation into potent APCs, dendritic cells transition from expressing primarily serotonin 5-HT1B-, 5-HT1E-and 5-HT2Breceptors in their immature state to expressing primarily 5-HT4-and 5-HT7-receptors in their mature state (Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2010; Carson & Lo, 2007) . Pharmacological studies demonstrate that the expressed receptors are functional and that they regulate stage-specific functions in dendritic cells. For example, 5-HT4-and 5-HT7-specific ligands suppress dendritic cell secretion of IL-12 and TNF-cytokines that play critical roles in promoting differentiation of Th1 CD4\ue031T-cells.",

The neuropeptides in the kinin family, specifically bradykinin and substance P, have potent pro-inflammatory effects on multiple immune cells (Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2010; Carson & Lo, 2007) . For example, treating myeloid cells with substance P triggers robust expression of TNF and granulocyte-recruiting chemokines as well as amplifying general responses to PAMPs. In vivo, these neuropeptides promote vasodilation and plasma extravasation leading to tissue edema. However, as illustrated by the maturation stage-specific effects of 5-HT on dendritic cell function, the ultimate outcomes of neuropeptide treatment will likely rely on the combinations of receptors expressed by APCs, responding T-cells and innate immune cells. Thus the same neuropeptide may trigger very different final immune outcomes depending on the time and sites of exposure. For example, VIP inhibits macrophages and dendritic cell production of proinflammatory molecules such as prostaglandins (Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2010; Carson & Lo, 2007) . However, VIP-deficient mice are resistant to EAE, while treating rats with VIP decreased the severity of experimental collagen induced arthritis (Abad et al., 2010; Deng et al., 2010) . The beneficial effects of VIP in the arthritis model were associated with an increased ratio of Treg to Th17 CD4\ue031T-cells.",

In brief, foreign grafts placed within the parenchyma of the CNS evaded T-cell rejection and survived for more prolonged periods than similar grafts placed under the skin. The absence of any detectable T-cell rejection of foreign grafts placed in the CNS was ascribed to at least three factors: n the absence of a population of CNS-resident immature dendritic cells able to capture antigens, migrate to draining lymph nodes and present antigen to T-cells n the absence of a CNS lymphatic system to facilitate drainage of soluble antigens and trafficking of immune cells from the CNS to lymph nodes n",

Thus, pathogen, mechanical or toxin-induced injuries to the BBB would be predicted to reveal previously hidden CNS antigens to autoreactive T-cells and to trigger CNS autoimmune disease. Second, neither the innate nor the adaptive immune systems could effectively detect infection or damage occurring within the CNS. The implications of considering the CNS as an immune-isolated organ appeared incompatible with the need to maintain a functional CNS as a condition of mammalian survival. The example of successful lifelong T-cell control of T. gondii infections of the CNS (see above) illustrates the fallacy of CNS immune isolation following infection; how can this be reconciled with the observed failure to reject foreign grafts within the CNS?

The capillary network is so dense that it is estimated that all neurons and glia are within 20 microns of a capillary. Unlike other organs, the CNS is protected and sheltered from routine exposure of blood-derived products by the BBB and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. In most other tissues, fenestrated or sinusoidal porous capillaries allow variable levels of small molecules to passively move from the blood into the tissue. In addition, some molecules are actively transported into tissues by intracellular transcytosis mechanisms. By contrast, the BBB of the CNS is an organized neurovascular unit composed of astrocytes, pericytes and specialized endothelial cells lacking fenestrated structures. Tight junctions between endothelial cells of the BBB prevent paracellular transport into the CNS of blood-derived molecules. Instead, blood-derived factors must be actively transported across the endothelial barrier by transcellular mechanisms. The abluminal (CNS parenchyma) side of these endothelial cells is surrounded by basement membranes and further encased by astrocytic endfeet. Pericytes are located in the perivascular space between the endothelial cells and astrocytic end-feet. The immune function of pericytes is the subject of substantial debate. However, recent data indicate they contribute to the neurogenic potential of the neurovascular unit. It is important to note that several brain regions, referred to as the circumventricular organs (CVOs), do not have complete BBBs. Therefore CVOs provide ports of entry for passive transfer of large molecules or specific cell types into the CNS (see also in Ch. 3).",

Activated immune cells also express a variety of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that facilitate migration across the BBB. Most na\u00efve T-cells also do not express sufficiently high levels of adhesion molecules to bind the luminal (blood side) face of CNS endothelial cells and extravasate into the CNS. Consequently, entry into the CNS is largely restricted to antigen-or chemokine-activated lymphocytes with high expression of adhesion molecules such as VLA-4 and LFA-1 that bind the VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expressed by activated endothelial cells. The dependence on these molecules is demonstrated by the effectiveness of an anti-VLA-4 therapeutic antibody (natalizumab) in the treatment of the CNS autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis (Clifford et al., 2010) . Individuals treated with natalizumab had large reductions in the numbers of T-cells trafficking into their CNS, large reductions in T-cell myelin damage and large reductions in clinical neurologic signs of CNS damage. However, the reduced T-cell trafficking came with a severe side effect associated with reduced tissue surveillance. By blocking the adhesion molecule required for efficient extravasation and subsequent infiltration into tissues, natalizumab increased the risk of JC virus, a normally benign virus, developing into a lethal brain pathogen (Clifford et al., 2010) .",

Genetic deletion of either CCL2 or CCR2, the receptor for CCL2, dramatically reduces the numbers of macrophages infiltrating the CNS in response to systemic immune activation or the presence of infection or other pro-inflammatory stimuli in the CNS. Different routes of entry into the CNS by different leukocyte populations may be regulated by different chemokines. Recently, the secretion of the chemokine CCL20 by the choroid plexus epithelium was demonstrated to be required for the entry of CCR6-expressing CD4\ue031Th17 cell and the subsequent initiation of CNS autoimmunity (Kim et al., 2010; Reboldi et al., 2009) . However a single chemokine may also serve to co-localize two interacting immune cell populations. CXCR3 is the receptor for C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10). Several studies suggest that the secretion of CXCL10 by astrocytes at the blood-brain barrier acts to limit pathology during autoimmune inflammation by recruiting and retaining CXCR3\ue031T-cells to the perivascular space.",

Following T. gondii infection, T-cells expressing CCR7 (the receptor for CCL21) migrate into the CNS along infection-induced reticular networks of CCL21.

However, CNS expressed CCL21 was by itself insufficient to support CD4\ue031T-cell extravasation into either the perivascular or parenchymal spaces in the CNS of uninfected mice. Furthermore, CCL21 expression leads to the spontaneous organization of inflammatory infiltrates into lymphoid-like structures in non-immune-privileged organs in response to infection or autoimmune triggers. Even in the presence of robust pro-inflammatory stimuli, CCL21 does not promote organization of infiltrating lymphocytes into lymphoid-like structures.

Microglia comprise between 10-20% of the total number of cells in the CNS. Morphologically, microglia display a stellate morphology in the healthy noninflamed adult CNS, but can develop an ameboid morphology in response to pathogenic stimuli. In CNS tissue sections, it is impossible to conclusively identify a cell as a CNS-resident microglia versus an acutely infiltrating blood-derived macrophage because microglia express the same macrophage cell-type-specific markers as other macrophages (constitutive markers such as Iba1, CD11b, and F4/80 and inducible markers such as MHC and co-stimulatory molecules). Therefore, it is not uncommon for many studies to refer to all macrophage-like cells detected in the CNS as microglia. However, gene profiling and functional assays both indicate that CNS-resident microglia are phenotypically distinct from macrophages and dendritic cells that acutely infiltrate the CNS (Schmid et al., 2009 ).",

First, rodents and humans can be treated with whole-body irradiation that is just sufficient to destroy the bone marrow and its contained stem cells that routinely replace short-lived hematopoietic cells within tissues and in circulation. Unless irradiated mammals receive donor bone marrow, they will die, because they will no longer be able to generate red or white blood cells. With one prominent exception, the tissue macrophages and all hematopoetic cells found in the irradiated hosts are replaced by cells derived from donor stem cells within a few months. The only tissue macrophages that remain host derived are the parenchymal microglia that are not destroyed within the CNS. It is important to note that the perivascular myeloid cells are donor derived (Hickey & Freeman, 1988) . Irradiation alters the vasculature and can facilitate inappropriate influx of myeloid cells into the CNS. However, these histologic observations have been confirmed using two additional methodologies: parabiotic linkage of the vasculature of two congenic strains of mice as well as a complex series of transgenic lineage studies. This latter study also demonstrated that microglia found in the adult CNS derive from primitive myeloid progenitors that arise before embryonic day 8 and are not bone marrow derived progenitors.",

Most tissue macrophages are short lived and continually replaced by bone marrow-derived stem cells. By contrast, microglia are long-lived and largely self-renewing. Lineage studies further indicate that microglia arise from a primitive yolk sac hematopoietic myeloid precursor and co-differentiate as the neuroectoderm forms the CNS. Although CNS-resident microglia cannot be reliably distinguished from infiltrating macrophages by histologic methods, microglia can be identified using flow cytometric analysis of brain cell suspensions. While all other nucleated hematopoietic populations express uniformly high levels of CD45 in the mature individual, CNS-resident microglia are unique in their uniform log order lower level of CD45 expression. Recently, gene profiling studies have demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells TREM-2 is preferentially expressed on CD45low microglia, while the pro-inflammatory TREM-1 is preferentially expressed on acutely infiltrating CD45hi macrophages (Schmid et al., 2009 ).",

Grafting dye-labeled microglia and macrophages into the parenchyma of the murine CNS clearly revealed that transferred CNS-resident microglia can migrate great distances within the CNS. However, microglia could not be detected to migrate to the draining cervical lymph nodes. Indeed, up to two weeks post-transfer, nearly all of the transferred CD45low microglia are retained in the healthy murine CNS. By contrast, CD45high macrophages transferred into healthy murine CNS can be detected within the draining cervical lymph nodes within 24 hours of transfer, with few retained in the CNS. Consistent with these studies, 2-photon microscopy studies of microglia motility in response to CNS injury demonstrated rapid motility of microglial process, but did not report rapid migration of microglial cell bodies away from the injured area. These data indicate that microglia do not present tissue antigens to lymph node at the same rate (if at all) as other tissue macrophages or immature dendritic cells.",

Consistent with their failure to emigrate from the CNS to lymph nodes, these types of studies have confirmed that CNS microglia are relatively ineffective at initiating antigen-driven CD4\ue031T-cell responses (Carson et al., 2006; Schwartz & Kipnis, 2011; Dilger & Johnson, 2008; Byram et al., 2004) . Instead, this function is provided primarily by infiltrating dendritic cells and to a lesser extent by perivascular macrophages. By themselves, these data do not indicate that microglial antigen presentation is irrelevant. Additional studies suggest that antigen presentation may have purposes complementary to professional APCs (Carson et al., 2006; Schwartz & Kipnis, 2011; Byram et al., 2004) . For example, CD4\ue031T-cells can develop neuroprotective functions able to slow the rate of axotomy-induced cell death of facial motoneurons located in the brain stem (Byram et al., 2004) . Using irradiation chimeric models and adoptive transfer of axotomy-activated CD4\ue031T-cells, microglia were again demonstrated to be unable to initiate axotomy-induced CD4\ue031T-cell responses. However, MHC class II-expressing microglia were demonstrated to be absolutely essential to evoke or sustain the neuroprotective functions of CD4\ue031T-cells initially activated by the peripheral immune system. In addition, several studies have reported that depending on the T-cell activation state, microglial-T-cell interactions can promote microglia to acquire either growth factor-producing, neurogenic, neuro-repairing phenotypes or cytotoxic, neurodestructive phenotypes.",

Experimental expression of Tmem176b inhibits acquisition of classical APC functions as well as increasing the rate of apoptosis of activated microglia and macrophages. These and similar data demonstrate the robust and active regulatory role of the CNS microenvironment and raise an unresolved and highly debated issue in neuroimmunology.

Here we present three rare complications of measles infection to demonstrate the consequences of too much, too little or just the wrong type of neuroimmune responses.",

            "text": "1. An immune response sufficiently effective to clear a pathogen can also cause lethal brain damage after the pathogen has been effectively cleared. For example, acute post-infectious measles encephalomyelitis (APME) is characterized by abrupt onset of fever, seizures and multifocal neurological signs one to two weeks after appearance of the measles rash and is fatal in 10-20% of patients. Despite the absence of detectable measles virus in the CNS of these patients, clinical features of APME correlate with robust influx of blood-derived macrophages and lymphocytes into the CNS. The sum of the published data suggest that during immune-mediated clearance of measles from the body, pathogen-provided alarm signals (PAMPs) led to the inappropriate activation of T-cells able to recognize self-antigens in 0.1% of patients infected with measles. 2. Ineffective immune responses are ineffective in removing PAMP signals and thus promote chronic neurotoxic inflammation. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare complication of measles infection and is associated with continual low-grade inflammation of the CNS. Clinical symptoms emerge 5-10 years after systemic clearance of the measles virus and include mental deterioration, appearance of myoclonus, optic atrophy and akinetic mutism. Based on experimental models, SSPE is presumed to result from CNS infection by partially defective measles virus particles incapable of budding from the surface of infected cells. The budding-defective viral clones are able to persist and spread throughout the CNS because of ineffective antigen presentation and detection of viral particles. Clinical pathology is likely the combined result of persistent production of TNF and IL-1\u03b2, accumulation of intrathecal oligoclonal IgG, as well as the persistence of measles virus within cells of the CNS. 3. Too little immunity can result in normally benign viruses, bacteria and parasites lethally disrupting brain function. In this situation, brain damage and/or death can be due to competition for metabolic components, to disruption of CNS intracellular signaling by pathogen products or to direct pathogen killing of CNS cells. Measles-infected children with viral or drug-induced immunodeficiencies cannot always control the viral infection, resulting in a general progressive neurological deterioration that includes seizures. Neuronal damage, astrogliosis and inclusion bodies in both neurons and glia are observed in brain pathology samples from infected individuals. The only effective treatment in this situation is to attempt to halt viral replication with antiviral drug therapies.",

However, recent studies suggest that sickness behavior may facilitate the onset or relapse of clinical depression. It is speculated that susceptibility may result from hyperproduction of TNF, IL1 or IL6, hypoproduction of IL-10, or less-efficient serotonergic function as occurs with homozygosity for the short allele of the 5-HT transporter gene.",

Therefore, age, environmental factors and neuronal activity may alter neuroimmune interactions with detrimental consequences for neuronal function. Thus, it is tempting to suggest that inhibiting neuroimmune responses is the correct therapeutic choice for neurodegenerative disease. However, the better choice might be to manipulate neuroimmune interactions to redirect immune-cell functions. For example, autoreactive T-cells can provide neuroprotection both directly and indirectly by stimulating CNS production of growth and survival factors (Schwartz & Kipnis, 2011; Dilger & Johnson, 2008) . Similarly, increasing influx of macrophages into the CNS and decreasing neuronal inhibition of microglial phagocytic activity are both effective measures to decrease amyloid burden in murine models of Alzheimer's disease.",
