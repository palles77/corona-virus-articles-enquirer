Countries hit by the Corona virus may also consider adopting a wider public e-mental health approach, which would focus additionally on prevention and on reaching people at risk for mental health disorders. In this respect, not only guided but also fully self-guided interventions, such as self-Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 help apps or online therapeutic modules, could also be applied in settings and countries with scarce mental health resources (Christiani & Setiawan, 2018) .

Agility, flexibility, and resilience are essential skills for 21-st-century institutions, particularly when unforeseen disruptive viruses and devastating events driven by climate change are likely to be increasingly common (Blumenstyk, 2020).
