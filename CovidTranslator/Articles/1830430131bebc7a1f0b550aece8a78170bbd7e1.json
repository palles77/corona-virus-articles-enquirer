Health is a major sector of any economy and often employs more people in the industrialized countries than any other industry. Health has complex networks of services and provider agencies, including funding through public or private insurance or through national health service systems. Whether insurance is provided by the state or through private and public sources combined, skilled management is required at the macro-or national and the micro-or local level, including the many institutions that make up the system. Management training of public health professionals and clinical services personnel is a requisite and not a luxury.",

Modern and successful public health also must address social, economic, and community determinants of health and the promotion of public policies and individual behaviors for health and well-being. The social capital and norms that promote cooperation among people are the basis of a \"civil society\" (i.e., the totality of voluntary, civic, and social organizations and institutions of a functioning society alongside the structures of governmental and commercial institutions). Health systems are ideally knowledge-and evidence-based in using technologies available in medicine and the environment to promote the health and well-being of a population, including security against the effects of threatened terrorism, growing social isolation, and inequities in health. Management in health can learn much from concepts of business management that have evolved to address the economic and human resource aspects of a health system at the macrolevel or an individual unit of service at the microlevel.",

As a governmental priority, health may be influenced by political ideology, sometimes reflecting societal attitudes of the party in power and sometimes apparently at odds with its general social policy. Following Bismarck's introduction in Germany in 1881 of national health insurance for workers and their families, funded by both workers and their employers, most countries in the industrialized world introduced variants of this national health plan. Usually, this has been at the initiative of socialist or liberal political leadership, but conservative political parties have preserved national health programs once implemented. Despite the new conservatism since the 1990s with its pre-eminent ideology of market forces, the growing roles for national, state, and local authorities in health have led to a predominantly government role in financing and overall responsibility for health care, even where there is no universal national health system, as in the USA. The UK's National Health Service (NHS), initiated by a Labour government in 1948, has survived through many changes of government, including the conservative Margaret Thatcher period in which many national industries and services were privatized.",

This realization has led to the implementation of universal access systems in most of the industrialized countries. Once initiated, national health systems require high levels of resources, because the health system is labor intensive with relatively high salaries for health care professionals. In these countries, health expenditures consume between 7 and nearly 18 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Some industrialized countries, notably those in the former Soviet bloc, lacking mechanisms for advocacy, including consumer and professional opinion, tended to view health with a political objective of social benefits, and also as a \"non-productive\" consumer of resources rather than a producer of new wealth. As a result, budget allocations and total expenditures for health as a percentage of GDP were well below those of other industrialized countries (Figure 12 .1). Salaries for health personnel in the Semashko system were low compared to industrial workers in the \"productive\" sectors. Furthermore, industrial policy did not promote modern health-related industries, compared to the military or heavy industrial sectors.",

The difference is that inappropriate policy can affect the lives and well-being of very large numbers of people, as opposed to an individual being harmed by the mistake of one doctor. There may be no \"correct\" answer, and there are numerous controversies along the path. Health policy remains more an \"art\" than the more quantitative and seemingly precise field of health economics. Societal, economic, and cultural factors as well as personal habits have long been accepted as having an important impact on vulnerability to coronary heart disease. But other factors such as the degree of control over one's life, as suggested in studies of British civil servants, religiosity, and the effects of migration on families left behind are part of the social gradients and inequalities seen in many disease entities, with consequent excess morbidity and mortality in some contexts, such as in Russia and Ukraine.",

Examination of the costs and benefits of alternative forms of health care helps in making decisions as to the structure and the content of health care services, both internal structures (within one organization) and external linkages (intersectoral cooperation with other organizations). The methods chosen to attain the goals become the applied health policy. The World Health Organization's (WHO's) 1977 Health for All strategy was directed at the political level and intended to increase governmental awareness of health as a key component of overall development. To some degree it succeeded despite its expansive aspirations, and even after nearly 40 years, its objectives remain worthwhile even in well-developed health systems. Within health, primary care was stressed as the most effective investment to improve the health status of the population. In 1993, the World Bank's World Development Report adopted the Health for All strategy and promoted the view that health is an important investment sector for general economic and social development.

The PPACA comes into effect on 1 January 2014 and will guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions, and ensure that premiums cannot vary based on gender or medical history. It will subsidize the cost of coverage, and new state-based health insurance exchanges will help consumers to find suitable policies. It will introduce many preventive care measures into public and private insurance plans, and will promote efficiencies in the health systems including reduction in fraudulent claims and wasteful funding systems.

The social structure of an organization includes values, norms, and roles governing the behavior of its participants.

An organizational structure needs to be tailored to the size and complexity of the entity and the goals it wishes to achieve. The structure of an organization is the way in which it divides its labor into distinct tasks and coordinates them. The major organizational models, which are not mutually exclusive and may indeed be complementary, are the pyramidal (bureaucratic) and network structures. The bureaucratic model is based on a hierarchical chain of command with clearly defined roles.

Taylor's industrial engineering studies of scientific management were based on the concept that the best way to improve worker productivity was by designing improved techniques or methods used by workers.

Mayo began with industrial engineering studies of the effect of increased lighting on production at an assembly line. This was followed by other improvements in working conditions, including reduced length of the working day, longer rest periods, better illumination, color schemes, background music, and other factors in the physical environment. These studies showed that production increased with each of these changes and improvements. However, the researchers discovered, to their surprise, that production continued to increase when the improvements were withdrawn. Furthermore, in a control group where conditions remained the same, productivity also grew during the study period.

Formal and informal social organizations among management and employees were recognized as key elements in productivity, now called industrial humanism. Research methods adapted from the behavioral sciences contributed to scientific studies in industrial management. Traditional theories of the bureaucratic model of organization and management were modified by the behavioral sciences. This led to the emergence of the systems approach, or scientific analysis to analyze complex structures or organizations, taking into account the mutually interdependent elements of activities, interactions, and interpersonal relationships between management and workers. Some revisits to the Hawthorne studies suggest that the data do not support the conclusions, and offer a different interpretation. One is that informal groups such as workers on a production line themselves set standards for work which assert an informal social control outside the authority system of the organization. The informal cohesive group can thus control the norms of the amount of work acceptable to the group, i.e., not \"too much\" and not \"too little\".

They describe two contrasting models of workforce motivation. Theory X assumes that management produces immature responses on the part of the worker: passivity, dependence, erratically shallow interests, shortterm perspective, subordination, and lack of self-awareness. In contrast, at the other end of the immaturity-maturity spectrum was the mature worker, with an active approach, an independent mind capable of a broad range of responses, deeper and stronger interests, a long-term perspective, and a high level of awareness and self-control. This model has been tested in a variety of industrial settings, showing that giving workers the opportunity to grow and mature on the job helps them to satisfy more than basic survival needs and allows them to use more of their potential in accomplishing organizational goals. This model became widely influential in human resource management theory of organizational behavior, organizational communication, and organizational development, and in the practical management of business and service enterprises.",

Following the war, Deming was invited to teach in Japan and moved from the university to the level of industrial management. Japanese industrialists adopted his principles of management and introduced quality management into all industries, with astonishingly successful results within a decade. The concept, later called total quality management (TQM), has since been adopted widely in production and service industries. In the Deming approach to company management, quality is the top priority and is the key responsibility of management, not of the workers. If management sets the tone and involves the workers, quality goes up, costs come down, and both customer satisfaction and loyalty increase. Having their ideas listened to, and avoiding a punitive inspection approach, enhances the pride of the workers. It is the responsibility of leadership to remove fear and build mutual participation and common interest. Training is one of the most important investments of the organization. The differences between traditional management and the TQM approach are shown in Boxes 12.1 and 12.2.

A health system is responsible for ensuring that a woman of reproductive age takes folic acid tablets orally before becoming pregnant, has had access to family planning services so that the pregnancy is a desired one, ensures that the space between pregnancies is adequate for her health and that of her baby, and receives adequate prenatal care. An obstetrics department should be involved in assuring or providing the prenatal care, especially for high-risk cases, and delivery should be in hygienic and professionally supervised settings.",

The governing agency, which may be a local non-profit board or a national health system, has overall legal responsibility for the operation and financial status of the hospital, as well as raising capital for improvements. The medical staff may be in private practice and work in the hospital with their own patients by application for this right as \"attending physician\", according to their professional qualifications, or the medical staff may be employed by the hospital in a similar way to the rest of the staff. Salaried medical staff may include physicians in administration, pathology, anesthesia, and radiology, so that even in a private practice market system many medical staff members are hospital employees. Increasingly, hospitals are employing \"hospitalists\", who are full-or part-time physicians whose work is in the health facility, to provide continuity of inpatient and emergency department services, augmenting the services of senior or attending staff or private practice physicians. This shift is in part related to the increasing numbers of female physicians who run their homes and families as well as practice medicine and who find this mode of work more attractive than full-time private practice. This model is the common arrangement in North American hospitals. The governing board of a \"voluntary\", nongovernmental, not-for-profit organization with municipal and community representatives may be appointed by a sponsoring religious, municipal, or fraternal organization.",

Managers use the processes, techniques and tools of a specific area. Human skill involves the ability to interact effectively with people. Managers interact and cooperate with employees. Conceptual skill involves the formulation of ideas. Managers understand abstract relationships, develop ideas, and solve problems creatively\".

If a district or a hospital is paid by the number of beds, or by days of care in the hospital, there is no incentive to introduce alternative services such as same-day or outpatient surgery and home care.",

More than half of commercial HMOs are using pay-for-performance. Recent legislation requires the Medicare and Medicaid programs to adopt this approach for beneficiaries and providers. As commercial programs have evolved during the past 5 years, the categories of providers (clinicians, hospitals, and other health care facilities), number of measures, and dollar amounts at risk have increased. This method of payment is likely to be promoted in the Affordable Care Act implementation to improve quality and control cost increases in US health care (see Chapters 10, 11, and 13). Payfor-performance has also been adopted in other countries trying to improve quality of care, such as Macedonia (Lazarevik and Kasapinov, 2012) .",

It includes the traditional public health programs, but equally must concern itself with managing and planning comprehensive service systems and measuring their function. The selection of targets and priorities is often determined by the feasible rather than the ideal. The health manager, either at the macrolevel of health or managing a local clinic, needs to be able to conceptualize the possibilities of improving the health of individuals and the population in his or her service responsibility with current and appropriate methods. Good management means designing objectives based on a balance between the feasible and the desirable. Public health has benefited greatly from its work with the social sciences and assistance from management and systems sciences to adapt and absorb the new challenges and technologies in applied public health. The New Public Health is not only a concept; it is a management approach to improve the health of individuals and the population.",

Massachusetts and Connecticut alone of all the states continued to ban birth control. But with the advent of the birth control pill in the 1960s, the issue was reopened. Richard Cardinal Cushing, head of the Archdiocese of Boston, no longer opposed a change in the state law, although still opposed the practice of birth control. Some Catholic doctors, including Dr John Rock, the gynecologist who conducted the key clinical studies of the birth control pill, favored a change in the law. An article published by a young Catholic doctor, later specializing in public health, in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine in 1964, called for changing the Massachusetts birth control law. This drew the ire of some of the hierarchy of the Church.",

They transcend the boundaries of specific disciplines and are independent of program and topic. They are the building blocks for effective public health practice, and the use of an overall public health approach.Generic core competencies provide a baseline for what is required to fulfill public health system core functions. These include population health assessment, surveillance, disease and injury prevention, health promotion, and health protection.The core competencies are needed to effectively choose options, and to plan, implement, and evaluate policies and/ or programs in public health, including the management of incidents such as outbreaks and emergencies.A public health practitioner is able to: l describe selected policy and program options to address a specific public health issue l describe the implications of each option, especially as they apply to the determinants of health and recommend or decide on a course of action l develop a plan to implement a course of action taking into account relevant evidence, legislation, emergency planning procedures, regulations, and policies l implement a policy or program and/or take appropriate action to address a specific public health issue l demonstrate the ability to implement effective practice guidelines l evaluate an action, a policy, or a program l demonstrate an ability to set and follow priorities, to maximize outcomes based on available resources l demonstrate the ability to fulfill functional roles in response to a public health emergency. of the individual, the population, and the economy. Because health care employs large numbers of skilled professionals and many unskilled people, it is often vital to the economic survival of small communities, as well as for a sense of community well-being.Management includes planning, leading, controlling, organizing, motivating, and decision-making. It is the application of resources and personnel towards achieving targets. Therefore, it involves the study of the use of resources, and the motivation and function of the people involved, including the producer or provider of service, and the customer, client, or patient. This cannot take place in a vacuum, but is based on the continuous monitoring of information and its communication to all parties involved. These functions are applicable at all levels of",
