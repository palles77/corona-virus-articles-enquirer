A review of the blood smear showed the presence of atypical lymphocytes (0.13 \u00c2 10 9 /L, normal range 0), and there was no platelet clumping (Fig. 1a) . The liver parenchymal enzymes were deranged with elevation of alanine aminotransferase (56 U/L, normal range 6e53 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (46 U/L, normal range 13e33 U/L), but the gammaglutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and the renal function tests were within normal limits. In view of the abnormal blood picture, flow cytometry studies were performed the next day, which demonstrated a reversed CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.3 suggestive of a reactive change due to viral infection. Extensive microbiological investigations for MLI were performed on the same day. Serum for heterophil antibodies by Monospot test was negative. EpsteineBarr virus (EBV) serology showed a past infection with positive EBNA and VCA IgG. The cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG was positive but the IgM was negative. The CMV pp65 antigenemia was negative.
