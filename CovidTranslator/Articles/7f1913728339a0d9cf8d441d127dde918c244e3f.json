            "text": "Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) has recently emerged as an important modulator of cell homeostasis. Elevated plasma NGAL levels, possibly because of activation of blood leukocytes, are associated with atherosclerosis. However, little is known about induction of NGAL expression in blood vessels. Using a rat carotid artery injury model, we found that NGAL was highly induced in the intima after angioplasty but was attenuated by adenovirus-mediated expression of a dominant-negative mutant of inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-B kinase \u2424 (dnIKK\u2424). Expression of NGAL mRNA and protein was also up-regulated in an NF-B-dependent manner in rat and human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in response to interleukin-1\u2424 stimulation. Rat SMC-produced NGAL was present as mono-and homomeric forms in the cytosol and in a complex containing matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) after secretion. In agreement with levels of NGAL, proteolytic activity of MMP-9 was markedly high in the intima of injured vessels and in the culture supernatant of activated intimal SMCs but was reduced in the vessels transduced with dnIKK\u2424. The present study reveals a previously unrecognized vascular response to angioplastic injury, characterized by NF-B-dependent expression of NGAL in vascular SMCs. Furthermore, SMC-produced NGAL interacts with MMP-9, a mechanism by which NGAL may modulate MMP-9 proteolytic activity in the vascular repair process.",

NGAL is a 25-kd glycoprotein that was initially identified as 24p3 in SV-40-infected primary mouse kidney cells. 1 Subsequently, the human homologous protein was found in specific granules of neutrophils, 2,3 involved in the allosteric activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and protection of the latter from degradation. 4, 5 Previous studies indicated that NGAL was able to bind small lipophilic substances including bacterial-derived formylpeptides, lipopolysaccharides, 6, 7 and catecholate-type ferric siderophores. 8 Therefore it may function as an effecter molecule of the innate immune system. Recent studies suggest that NGAL also plays an important role in cell homeostasis. 9, 10 The relevance of NGAL to cardiovascular diseases is primarily unknown. Recently, elevated plasma NGAL levels, possibly because of activation of blood leukocytes, were associated with atherosclerosis and implicated as a predictor for cardiovascular mortality after cerebrovascular ischemia. [11] [12] [13] We have recently reported the presence of NGAL in atherosclerotic plaques, 14 raising the possibility that expression of NGAL can be induced in vascular cells during atherogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms for the induction of NGAL in vascular cells remain unknown.",

In addition to NGAL, a marked upregulation of MMP-9 was observed in the vessels shortly after injury ( Figure 1A) . To explore the regulatory mechanism for the injury-induced vascular expression of NGAL, NF-B signaling was blocked in the injured vessel by transduction with dnIKK\u2424. This resulted in virtually complete suppression of NGAL and MMP-9 expression at day 14 ( Figure 1A) , implying a pivotal role for NF-B signaling in their transcriptional regulation. However, the induction of MMP-9 was not abolished by dnIKK\u2424 at day 3, in agreement with our previous finding that NF-B activity was not inhibited by dnIKK\u2424 at this time point. 27 Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that NGAL protein predominantly located in the intima area of injured vessels at day 14 ( Figure 1B , bottom left) but was markedly reduced in the vessel transfected with dnIKK\u2424 ( Figure 1B , bottom right).",

In vivo, NGAL was highly expressed and confined to the intima of arteries at day 14 but not yet detected in the media early after injury (day 3). Therefore, a mechanistic explanation for the absence of NGAL in the media at the early phase after vascular injury remains to be elucidated. .

Activation of NF-B is a pivotal mechanism underlying the induction of genes implicated in vascular inflammation, cell proliferation, and death. 18 Our recent study demonstrated that in contrast to the resolved NF-B activation in the media, the intima exhibited a persistent NF-B activation coupled with high levels of IKK activity at the late stage of vascular injury. 27 NGAL expression in the injured vessel seems consistent with the spatial pattern of NF-B activation. Moreover, analysis of the NGAL gene promoter identified NF-B binding sites potentially critical for the transcriptional regulation of NGAL expression. 20 The present study in human SMCs also demonstrates that IL-1\u2424 triggers NF-B binding activity to DNA in the NGAL promoter region. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the expression of NGAL might be modulated by NF-B signaling in SMCs subjected to injury. By transfecting the injured vessels with dnIKK\u2424, which has been shown to effectively block injury-induced NF-\u232a signal in the intima, 27 both NGAL transcripts and protein were significantly suppressed. Our data thus advanced the previous understanding of regulation of NGAL expression in vitro, implicating a critical role for IKK\u2424-mediated NF-B signaling in NGAL expression within the injured artery. The direct function of NF-B signaling in mediating NGAL expression by SMCs was further ascertained by infecting the medial and intimal SMCs with dnIKK\u2424, indicating that up-regulation of NGAL in SMCs is dependent on NF-B activation.",

Although our in vivo data show MMP-9 was rapidly induced in the media after vessel injury and remained highly expressed in the developing intima after 2 weeks, induction of this gene was not inhibited by dnIKK\u2424 at day 3. A possible explanation for this is that NF-B has not been suppressed by dnIKK\u2424 or the induction of MMP-9 is independent on NF-B activation at the early stage of vascular injury. 33, 34 Nevertheless, NGAL seems to be induced later and predominantly expressed by intimal SMCs, suggesting that MMP-9 and NGAL are co-expressed during intimal formation. The co-expression of NGAL and MMP-9 by intimal SMCs implies a functional interaction between the two gene products. However, intimal SMCs produce much less MMP-9 both at the transcriptional and protein level compared with medial SMCs. Nevertheless, this may not correspond to its proteolytic activity, as discussed later.",

            "text": "Intriguingly, Western blot analysis performed under nonreducing conditions suggests that cytosolic NGAL exists as a monomer, homodimer, homotrimer in rat SMCs. IP analysis further showed that NGAL could be detected as two bands correspondent as \u03f320and 25-kd molecules, dependent on whether it is glycosylated. 3, 35 Most importantly, IP analysis for cell supernatants and lysates demonstrates that NGAL and MMP-9 could form a complex only after they are secreted from the cells, and the amount of complexes is enhanced on IL-1\u2424 stimulation. This finding implies a functional interaction between NGAL and MMP-9 produced by vascular SMCs. Indeed, gelatinase zymography of cell supernatants demonstrates that there is a considerable increase in MMP-9 activity accompanied with NGAL/MMP-9 complex. A previous study 5 suggested that neutrophil-derived MMP-9 activity could be protected in the presence of NGAL, although precise molecular basis of the interaction remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the functional relevance of NGAL and MMP-9 in proteolytic activity was further examined in vivo by in situ zymography. Our data indicate a tight relationship between the proteolytic activity and expression of NGAL, as demonstrated by the substantially enhanced proteolytic activity in the intima. On the other hand, inhibition of NF-B results in dampened MMP activity in the injured vessels. These data support a plausible but yet-to-be-proven hypothesis that NGAL may contribute to be a novel mechanism in regulating the vascular repair-remodeling process by enhancing MMP-9 activity. However, the regulatory process of MMP-9 activity is rather complex, and several other molecules such as TIMPs could be involved. 36 Nevertheless, direct evidence for modulation Figure 6 .

            "text": "Expression of NGAL and MMP-9 in the injured vessels. A: Transcripts of NGAL and MMP-9 were determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR at the indicated times in the injured carotid arteries transduced with recombinant adenoviral vector expressing \u2424-galactosidase (\u2424-gal) or dominant-negative IKK\u2424 (dnIKK\u2424). Levels of transcripts are expressed in relative units normalized to hypoxanthine guanidine ribonucleosyltransferase (HPRT) mRNA. Data are presented as mean \u03ee SEM from six to eight rats for each time point. *P \u03fd 0.05, versus \u2424-gal group at day 14; # P \u03fd 0.05, \u2424-gal group at day 14 versus the uninjured group; & P \u03fd 0.05, \u2424-gal group at day 3 versus the uninjured group. B: Immunostaining for NGAL in the carotid arteries transduced with \u2424-gal or dnIKK\u2424 at day 3 and day 14 after injury and in an uninjured vessel. Control for the NGAL immunostaining was conducted by applying excess blocking peptide in a \u2424-gal-transduced vessel at day 14 (top right). The arrows indicate internal elastic lamina, and the arrowheads indicate cells showing representative positive signals for NGAL (brown color). All of the sections are counterstained with hematoxylin.

            "text": "Effect of dnIKK\u2424 on NF-B activation and the expression of TNF-\u2423, NGAL, and MMP-9 in the medial and intimal SMCs. A: NF-B activation was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay in both medial and intimal SMCs. Cells are stimulated with IL-1\u2424 for 30 minutes with or without preinfection with \u2424-gal or dnIKK\u2424 for 1 hour (h). The specificity of binding was verified by using excess amounts of unlabeled NF-B or AP-1 probes. The arrow indicates NF-B-specific DNA-protein complex. B: Cells are stimulated with IL-1\u2424 for 6 hours with or without preinfection with \u2424-gal or dnIKK\u2424. Transcripts of TNF-\u2423, NGAL, and MMP-9 in SMCs were determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and normalized to hypoxanthine guanidine ribonucleosyltransferase (HPRT) mRNA. Data are presented as mean \u03ee SEM from three independent experiments. *P \u03fd 0.05, versus \u2424-gal group treated with IL-1\u2424; & P \u03fd 0.05 versus the untouched intimal SMCs; # P \u03fd 0.05, versus the untouched medial SMCs.",
