Avian flu is 1 of more than 25 influenza A viruses that reside primarily in birds but also infect humans and other mammals. Avian flu is responsible for the current outbreak in Asia; H5N1 has now displayed probable human-to-human transmission; it could be a harbinger of a global epidemic. Anesthesiologists are exposed to a risk for infection when they are involved in airway instrumentation of infected patients. Given the evidence of emerging resistance to common antiviral agents used to treat H5N1 influenza virus and limited supply of H5N1 vaccine, prevention is our best protection. The following article will detail the virology and preventive public health practices for H5N1. This knowledge can also be used to define and prevent other yet unidentified infectious threats. D",

Although human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus remains sporadic [7, 8] , the virus has the potential to transform itself into subtypes for which little immunity exists. Genetic reassortment can also occur when one individual is simultaneously infected with both the rare H5N1 virus and with another, more common human subtype. The result is a subtype that lacks innate immunity but possesses a high degree of transmissibility to humans. Although H5N1 has shown no human reassortment to date, the potential for pandemic spread exists if more effective, sustained human transmission occurs. Similar scenarios were seen in the other influenza pandemics: Asian flu (H2N2) in 1957 and Hong Kong flu (H3N2) in 1968, whose combined death toll was greater than 100 000 deaths in the United States alone [9].",

Currently, avian flu is treated with varying efficacy, using between 1 and 4 different antiviral drugs: amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir, and zanamivir. However, H5N1 has now shown resistance to both amantadine and rimantadine, rendering treatment less predictably effective [10] . Although production of an effective vaccine for avian flu is now in progress, worldwide distribution would require costly global efforts and would likely be too late to prevent significant disease if a pandemic were to occur [7] . In addition, pandemics, which typically last much longer than other public health threats, can reappear in bwavesQ as the agent is spread to new locations or with induction of a newly resistant strain. Severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian flu are models for primary prevention methods. Indeed, traditional public health measures of surveillance and quarantine contributed greatly to halting the SARS epidemic [11] .",

The overuse of antibiotics could also have prompted virulent coevolution of viruses. bNature is opportunistic, so whenever a new niche is created, emergent and old disease will inevitably seek to exploit the new opportunities. The fact that pathogens are able to maximize their potential very quickly following the opening of a new niche clearly serves as a warning of the power of humans as a selective force shaping disease diversityQ [17] .",

Clearly, the public health measures are the first-line defenses for containing these new viruses. bOnly careful and rapid application of knowledge and reason through a variety of public health measures has been effective in minimizing the spread and severity of the epidemic.
