In this study, we report the results of a survey of codon usage bias of FMD virus (FMDV) representing all seven serotypes (A, O, C, Asia 1, SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3). Correspondence analysis, a commonly used multivariate statistical approach, was carried out to analyze synonymous codon usage bias. The analysis showed that the overall extent of codon usage bias in FMDV is low. Furthermore, the good correlation between the frequency of G + C at the synonymous third position of sense codons (GC 3S ) content at silent sites of each sequence and codon usage bias suggested that mutation pressure rather than natural (translational) selection is the most important determinant of the codon bias observed. In addition, other factors, such as the lengths of open reading frame (ORF) and the hydrophobicity of genes also influence the codon usage variation among the genomes of FMDV in a minor way. The result of phylogenetic analyses based on the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values indicated a few obvious phylogenetic incongruities, which suggest that more FMDV genome diversity may exist in nature than is currently indicated. Our work might give some clues to the features of FMDV genome and some evolutionary information of this virus.",

Due to different genomes having their own characteristic patterns of synonymous codon usage [1] , it has not been easy to provide a satisfactory explanation for the particular pattern found in a given genome. Compositional constraints and translational selection are thought to be the main factors accounting for codon usage variation among genes in different organisms such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Dictyostelium discoideum [2] , Drosophila melanogaster [3] and Caenorhabditis elegans [4] . However, in some prokaryotes with extremely high A + T or G + C contents [2] and human [5] , mutation bias is the major factor accounting for the variation in codon usage. In contrast, it was reported that translational selection at silent sites played the most important role in shaping codon usage in Zea mays [6] and Arabidopsis thaliana [7] . Recently, codon usage was suggested to be related to gene function [8] and protein secondary structure [9] .",

For example, HIV has a marked codon usage bias, due to its strong preference for the A nucleotide [10] . Rubella virus has a genomic G + C content of 0.70 [16] . Codon usage in Epstein-Barr virus (a DNA virus) may have an influence on regulation of latent versus productive infection [17] . In contrast, in nucleopolyhedroviruses codon usage appears to be simply a consequence of uneven base composition [11] . These published studies are mostly restricted to particular groups of viruses and have usually addressed phylogenetic questions [11, [18] [19] [20] . Moreover, mutational pressure rather than translational selection is the most important determinant of the codon bias in some RNA viruses [11, 13, 14, 21, 22] . However, a recent study showed that the G + C compositional constraint is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in iridovirus genomes [23] . Clearly, studies of the synonymous codon usage in viruses can reveal information about the molecular evolution of individual genes and such information would be relevant in understanding the regulation of viral gene expression and also to vaccine design where the efficient expression of viral proteins may be required to generate immunity [24] .",

            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of cattle and other cloven-hoofed animals. Apart from the influence on animal health and welfare, the economic impact of an outbreak of FMD can be of great importance for a country's export trade. The 2001 European outbreak of FMD which mainly affected the UK is estimated to have cost of 6000 million Euros [25] . Effective vaccines and stringent control measures have enabled FMD eradication in most developed countries, which maintain unvaccinated, seronegative herds in compliance with strict international trade policies. However, Outbreaks with devastating economic consequences still occur in many developing regions of Asia, Africa and South America, posing a serious problem for commercial trade with FMD-free countries. FMD is caused by FMD virus (FMDV), a small, non-enveloped virus that contains a single stranded positive-sense RNA genome of about 8500 nucleotides from the Aphthovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. The capsid is made of four proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4) and there are seven serotypes (A, O, C, Asia I, SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3) that can be further divided into many genotypes according to nucleotide difference in the capsid proteins [26] . Although genome sequences of FMDV have been published and some studies have been performed on them in recent years [27] [28] [29] [30] , little codon usage analysis is available. Such information might give some clues to the features of virus biology and some evolutionary information of this virus, and also it is of interest to understand the factors that shape codon usage in this species. In the present study, the codon usage bias was analyzed in these seven serotypes of FMDV genomes. The key evolutionary determinants of codon usage bias in these viruses were also investigated.",

FMDV genomes SN 14, 23 were from pigs and FMDV genomes SN 15,16 and 17 have been reported to pig-adapted isolates carrying a deletion in 3A (codons93-102). Alterations or deletion in this region are associated with the reduced ability of the virus to cause FMD in cattle. A program based on Perl has been developed to extract the annotated ORF sequences from each genome.",

The reported value of ENC is always between 20 (when only one codon is used for each amino acid) and 61 (when all codons are used equally) [32] . GC 3S , the frequency of the nucleotide G + C at the synonymous third codon position (excluding Met, Trp and the termination codons), was also used to calculate the extent of base composition bias. Similarly, GC 1S and GC 2S are the frequencies of the nucleotide G + C at the synonymous first and second position, respectively. In oder to examine the relationship between codon usage variation and compositional constraints, the GC 1S , GC 2S and GC 3S of each selected ORF have been calculated.",

The patterns of codon usage in different strains also appear to be closely related to the GC content on the third codon position. Linear regression analysis has been implemented to each virus genome to find some correlation between synonymous codon usage and nucleotide compositions of the ORFs. We also found that axis 1 coordinates are correlated with GC 3S and GC (r = 0.843, P \\ 0.01; r = 0.813, P \\ 0.01), while there are significant correlations between axis 2 value and GC 3S (r = 0.355, P \\ 0.05).

Therefore, we performed a linear regression analysis on axis 1, axis 2 and axis 3 between the hydrophobicity of each protein and ORF length. It was found that axis 2 coordinates are also significantly correlated with the hydrophobicity of each protein (r = 0.659, P \\ 0.01), while axis 1 and axis 3 coordinates are also significantly correlated with the ORF length (r = -0.564, P \\ 0.01; r = 0.610, P \\ 0.01) respectively, indicating that the hydrophobicity of each protein and ORF length are also critical in affecting these viruses' codon usage, although they were less important than that of the mutational bias.",

Up to now, it is unclear how FMDV serotypes might affect codon choice in FMD viruses and we used RSCU [42] , ENC [32] , COA [43, 44] and GC 3S , to measure the synonymous codon usage bias in order to minimize the effects of serotypes on codon bias, which have been successfully used to analyze the variation of codon usage among different viruses species [11, 13, 14, 22, 45, 46] . The analysis revealed that codon usage bias is low in most cases. [14, 22, 47] . In the case of human RNA viruses, the average ENC value also probably lies close to 45 since the distribution of values for [13] individual virus ranges uniformly from just under 38.5 to 58.3 [13] . One possible explanation about why FMDV had had a lower codon usage bias than other RNA viruses [13, 14, 22, 47] is that a low bias is advantageous to viruses that need to replicate efficiently in vertebrate cells, with potentially distinct codon preferences. A general mutational bias, which affects the whole genome would, certainly account for the majority of the codon usage variation. The genome base compositions affected the codon usage in Entamoeba histolytica genome [48] . Although the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome [49] had high GC contents, there was a little evidence that the genome composition shaped the codon usages in this genome. C. elegans showed a weak, but statistically significantly negative correlation between 'G + C' content and gene expression levels [50] . In human RNA viruses, H5N1 virus and SARS Coronavirus, mutation pressure rather than natural (translational) selection is the most important determinant of the codon bias. In this study, the general association between codon usage bias and base composition suggests that mutational pressure, rather than natural (translational) selection is supported by the highly significant correlation between GC 12 and GC 3S (r = 0.432, P \\ 0.05), and the result of ENC-plot (Fig. 2) . The fact that GC content varies in a similar way at all codon positions is usually assumed to be the result of mutational bias. A general mutational bias, which affects the whole genome would certainly account for the majority of the codon usage variation. A similar pattern of codon usage has been reported amongst some RNA viruses [13] . Since mutation rates in RNA viruses are much higher than those in DNA viruses [40] , it is understandable that mutation pressure is the determinant source of codon usage bias in the 40 FMDV strains included in this study. Therefore, mutational bias is the major factor responsible for the variation of synonymous codon usage among ORFs in these virus genomes.",

Those indicated that different genomes had different ORF lengths which accommodated their particular genome's best requirements, and there were not universal rules about ORF length and codon usage in all genomes. In this study, the ORF length had played a critical role in affecting FMDV codon usage. The mechanisms that lead this is not clear, which is needed a more comprehensive analysis.",

For instance, Five O strains (HKN/2002, Tau-Yuan TW97 (Taiwan, 1997), Chu-Pei (Taiwan) (pig strain), Yunlin/Taiwan/97, and lz were clustered into Lineage III; One C strain (Argentina/85) was clustered into sublineageI5 and one Asia 1 strain (YNBS/China/58) was clustered into sublineageI6. Although they all belong to EURO-SA topotype [55] , five C in sublineage I1 are subserotype C1 and one C in sublineage I5 is sub-serotype C3. The three A strains in Sublineage I2 was EURO-SA topotype and A strains sublineageI8 is Asia topotype, O stains in sublineageI3 is EURO-SA topotype, while 14 O strains in sublineage I6 belong to ME-SA topotype, PanAsia stains, were clustered into. O strains in Lineage III are Cathay topotype. All five SAT strains were clustered into Lineage II. Taken together, just as stated by other researchers [30, [56] [57] [58] , these results suggest that FMDV sequences may undergo intertypic recombination, which conceivably undergo complex recombination events and the result of phylogenetic analyses based on the RSCU values fail to display serotype-specific phylogenetic relationships. These observations raise interesting questions about FMDV genome evolution in nature and the relative contribution of recombination to the generation of FMDV genetic and population diversity.",

Our analysis revealed that although there are a few, variations in codon usage bias among different FMD viruses, codon usage bias in FMDV is low. Due to lack of data and politic factors, in this article, it is impossible to obtain information on the virus isolation background, vaccination etc, but clearly, a more comprehensive analysis is needed to reveal more information about codon usage bias variation within and among FMD viruses and what other factors are responsible, including the influence of factors, such as cell tropism, principal host species, method of transmission, and viral genetic structure. Such information would then allow us to more precisely judge the relative importance of mutation pressure versus natural selection in determining base composition and codon usage in these pathogens.",
