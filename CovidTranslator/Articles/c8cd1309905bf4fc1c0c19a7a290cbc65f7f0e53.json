Immunopathol., Lack of genetic variability and apparent susceptibility of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) to coronavirus infection has lead to speculation that this species may have immune system deficits. To establish a foundation for evaluation of the immune function, cheetah peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were stimulated by a panel of six mitogens, and responses compared with those of domestic cat PBM. Individual responses in both species were variable, but evenly distributed throughout the range of stimulation for each mitogen. Proliferation by PBM from domestic cats occurred within the same range as that of ~he cheetahs. However, a significantly lower response to peanut agglutinin (PNA) was observed with domestic cat PBM.",

Values for B cells (31.2% slg + ) and Tc (28.7% FT2+ ) were slightly higher in domestic cats as compared with cheetah PBM (13.3% slg+; 19.0% FT2 + ). Even though no species-specific deficits were detected, a significant negative correlation between PHA-stimulated proliferation and percent FT2 + (Tc) cheetah cells was observed. This indicates that proliferation can be used indirectly to assess relative numbers of functional T helper cells in cheetahs. Our studies suggest that these aspects of the cheetah's immune system are comparable with the domestic cat, and establish a basis for in vitro assays evaluating antigen-specific responses.

            "text": "Viral diseases are a significant problem in both domestic cat and captive exotic cat populations. Clinical feline leukemia virus (FeLV) (Briggs and Ott, 1986) , feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV) (Pfeifer et al., 1983) , and feline herpesvirus (FHV-1 ) (Scherba et al., 1988 ) infections have been reported in cheetahs. During 1982 During -1983 , an epizootic of FIPV infection in a colony ofcaptive-raised cheetahs resulted in over 90% morbidity and 19 deaths (54% mortality) (O'Brien et al., 1985; Evermann et al., 1986 Evermann et al., , 1988 . While coronavirus infection is common in domestic cats, mortality caused by feline ir~fectious peritonitis is low. The apparent susceptibility of cheetahs stimulated speculation that this species' immune system was not competent to defend against specific viral infections, and led to investigations which demonstrated extreme monomo~hism at red blood cell and leukocyte isoenzyme loci, as well ~.s major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci (assessed by allogeneic skin graft survival) (O'Brien eta!,, 1983 (O'Brien eta!,, , 1985 . Since self-restricted, virus-specific cell-mediated cytotoxicity plays an important role in the host's immune response to viral infection, it has been suggested that reduced MHC polymorphism may alter the host's ability to respond to infection and could result in a uniform susceptibility among individuals of a species (Toolan, 1978; McGuire et al., 1985; Watkins et al., 1988) . This hypothesis has been suggested as an explanation for the outcome of the FIPV epizootic in cheetahs (O'Brien et al., 1985 ) . However, assays designed to assess the cheetah's general immune function have not been performed. In stimulated proliferation) and phenotype of cheetah PBM to determine whether this species exhibited a unitbrmly poor immune response that may account for its unique susceptibility to certain pathogens. In addition, these studies lay a foundation for further investigations of virus-specific cell-mediated immune responses, and for possible differences between felids.",

Among cheetahs from which serial samples were taken, individuals could be classified as consistently high or low responders. Possible mechanisms accounting for these differences were investigated by examining the response of mitogen-stimulated cells to exogenous IL-2 and phenotypic analysis of the PBM population. The ability of IL-2 supplementation to augment proliferation ofboth high and low responders indicated that cheetah PBM can be stimulated to express IL-2 receptors, and that both groups have IL-2 responsive cells in their repertoire.

Phenotypic comparisons showed slightly higher numbers of SIg + (B) and FT2 + (Tc) cells in domestic cat PBM versus cheetah PBM. However, the increase may be an artefact of greater affinity for the species to which the antibody was developed (domestic cat). Therefore, the similar phenotypic distribution between species is consistent with the observed similarities in proliferative responses. Interestingly, when examining the relationship between prolifera-tion and phenotype in individual cheetahs, a significant correlation was observed. For example, Cheetah 12, a low responder in the mitogen studies, had increased numbers of FT2 + cells. The decrease in proliferation with increased numbers of FT2 + cells could be explained by postulating a concomittant decrease in T helper cells or an increase in T suppressor (Ts) cells, as has been demonstrated in humans (Chudwin et a!.~ 1983) . Since cytotoxic and suppressor T cells share phenotypic markers in other species, this may be an alternative explanation for the lower response. Some cheetahs may have greater numbers of suppressor cells (possibly FT2 + ) that upset the immune system's delicate balance. Further studies which examine T cell subpopulation functions such as suppressor assays are necessary to test this hypothesis.",

Since IL-2 responsiveness has been correlated with the level of in vitro T lymphocyte proliferation (llonen and Salmi, 1982; Miller-Edge and Splitter, 1986), experiments were performed to assess the role of IL-2 in feline mitogenic responses. Preliminary experiments have shown that suboptimal doses of mitogen enhance conditions for detecting responses to exogenous IL-2. Therefore, 0.25% PHA was used in these cultures. Data inFig. 3suggest that cheetah PBM were not capable of responding to IL-2 unless stimulated with mitogen to express IL-",
