            "text": "When ATP standard curves were determined in presence of Triton X-t00 and phosphate~buffered saline (PBS) or MM-medium they were linear in the range of 10 -7 to 10 -1\u00b0 molar ATP. The standard curves showed a slope of 2.39 \u00d7 1012 + 3.74 \u00d7 10 l\u00b0 counts per second (cps), an ordinate interception of 4.12\u00d7103+1.44\u00d7103 cps and a correlation coefficient of 0.999. ATP measurements in mock-infected cells at pH 7.2 or pH 6 showed a constant intraceltular ATP concentration over the time periods investigated (Fig. I) . The cellular ATP level was identical in SFV-infeeted cells at pH 7.2 ( Fig. l) and was estimated to be in the range of 1-3 InN assuming a mean cell diameter of approximately 10 ~m. This value corresponds to normal intracellular ATP concentrations as described for other cell types. When Aedes celts were infected with SFV and the pH was lowered to 6 at 16 hours post infection (p.i.), fusion conditions were established, and the intracellular ATP level started to decrease over 60 minutes reaching 10-15 per cent of the inNal value ( Fig. 1) . Concomitantly, the cells underwent fusion and the syneytium formation was completed after approximately 30 minutes. This deerease of intraeellular ATP was not due to a leakage of the plasma membrane and diffusion of ATP into the extra-cellular space, since no increase in extraeellular ATP could be detected. ATP added to MM-medium or PBS containing 25 mM glucose, also in low concentrations, is stable over one hour. This is in agreement with results of KOB~ET and collaborators which also showed that SFV-induced cell-cell fusion of Aedes albopietus cells does not lead to a leakiness of the plasma membrane (unpublished observations). In contrast, mock-infected cells, when exposed to MM-medium of pH 6 or PBS pH 6 containing 25 mM glucose, showed a constant, cellular ATP level ( Fig. 1) , :identical to that of infected or mock-infected cells at pH 7.2. Thus, it can be concluded that the formation of polykaryocytes correlates with a decrease in intracellular ATP. However, this does not prove that ATP is used for fusion per se. The decrease in ATP could be due to the fact that the experimental conditions produce a large, artificial proton gradient across the plasma membrane so that ATP is used to maintain the intraeellular pH at its physiological value. Therefore, additional experiments were per- formed, where tJhe external pH was restored to its originM value. SFVinfected cells were exposed for 1 minute to pH 6 at 16 hours p.i.; then the pH 6 medium was replaced by growth medium or PBS, containing 25 mM glucose, of pH 7.2. These conditions also lead to polykaryocyte formation in case of infected Aedes cells (10) . After a 1 minute exposure to pH 6, the syncytium formation was again accompanied by a decrease of cellular ATP, similar to the previous experiment, as depicted in Fig. 1 . These results suggest that consumption of ATP during polykaryocyte formation is not due to the implied pH gradient across the plasma membrane. The finding that the ATP level also drops during fusion at pH 7.2, when the stress of an approximately l0 times higher H + concentration is released, is a good indication that tbrmation of giant polynuclear cells is a process requiring ATP. This in turn would explain the finding mentioned above that NaN a inhibited cell-cell fusion. Therefore, we investigated several inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation and used them to correlate the cellular ATP level with the syncytium formation.",

Under these conditions, the infected cells were rapidly and totally depleted of ATP (Fig. 2) and polykaryocyte formation was prevented. These results further support the assumption that syncytium formation induced by low pH in SFV-infected cells requires ATP. Since depletion of cellular ATP by the various drugs mentioned above evidently occurs at a much slower rate at physiological pH, infected cells were not left at pH 6, but only exposed for 1 to 10 minutes to Then this medium was replaced by PBS/glucose, pH 7.2, containing the inhibitor and thereafter cellular ATP was measured. After 30 minutes, the formation of giant polynuelear cells was observed in the experiments with a 1 and 5 minutes exposure to low pH, whereas a I0 minutes exposure to pH 6 in presence of dinitrophenol abolished syncytium formation pH 6 in presence of 10 tXM dinitrophenol to achieve a partial ATP depletion. Cellular ATP concentrations were recorded at regular intervals after restoring the pH to 7.2 and polykaryoeyte formation was examined 30 minutes alger the low pH exposure. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 , this treatment leads to a rapid depletion of the eellular ATP as expected from the previous experiments shown in Fig. 2 . However, replacement of the pH 6 medium after 1 minute with PBS ofpH 7.2, containing 25 mM glucose and the inhibitor, or with MM-medium of pH 7.2 and the inhibitor, resulted in a rapid, partial restoration of the intraeellular ATP concentration before it started to decrease again. In this situation, polykaryoeyte tbrmation took place. When the cells were exposed for 5 minutes to pH 6 in presence of 10 ~M dinitrophenol, the recovery of the cellular ATP occurred to a lesser degree. Nevertheless, syneytium formation was still observed. Finally, a prolonged exposure of 10 minutes or more to the inhibitor and pH 6 led to an almost totM depletion of the cellular ATP level with only ~ slight restoration-less than 10 per cent-and the absence of polykaryocyte formation. Therefore, the results strongly suggest that fusion of SFV-infeeted cells triggered by low pH requires ATP and thus can be blocked by depletion of cellular ATP by inhibitors of the oxidative phosphorylation. If this assumption is correct, the other inhibitors of oxidative phosphorytation should show identical effects on intraccllular ATP concentration and polykaryocyte formation under the conditions mentioned so far. To this end, identical experiments were carried out in presence of 1 mM KCN. As depicted in Fig. 4 , ~ 1 minute exposure to pH 6 in presence of the inhibitor followed by incubation at pH 7.2 resulted in a partial recovery of the cellular ATP level. This restoration was mainly expressed as an arrest of the decrease of cellular ATP over approximately 15 minutes-at 40 to 50 per cent of the initial value-accompanied by the formation of polykaryocytes. Fig. 4 , a short exposure allowed polykaryocyte formation, whereas with a 30 minutes exposure time only partial fusion was observed. The longest exposure time led to a failure of syneytium formation After a 5 minutes exposure, syncytium formation was partially inhibited, whereas after l0 minutes at pit 6 it was totMly blocked. When 1 mM NaN3 was used as an inhibitor the time to deplete the cells was prolonged by a factor of up to 5 in the experiment shown in Fig. 5 . All exposure times allowed a partial restoration of the cellular ATP concentration, but syncytium formation occurred only after the 5 minutes and partially after the 30 minutes exposure, whereas a longer pH 6 treatment in presence of NuNs (60 minutes) prevented polykaryocyte formation.",

The growth medium of SFV-infected ceils was replaced at 16 hours p.i. by PBS pH 7.2 containing 50 mM 2-deoxyglucose, The intracellular ATP concentration was determined at regular intervals. After 90 minutes either the pH was lowered to 6 or the PBS/2deoxyglucose was exchanged for MM medium.

Cellular ATP concentration was measured over 90 minutes. As shown in Fig. 6 , the cellular ATP level decreased to approximately 10 to 20 per cent of the initial value. Lowering the pH to 6 at this time resulted in a greatly delayed and hampered fusion, as judged by light microscopy.

            "text": "Syneytium formation of SFV-infected Aedes albopictus cells at mildly acidic pH can be inhibited by a wide variety of chemicals (11) . Some of these drugs are known to deplete cells of ATP. In this report, we demonstrate that depletion of cellular ATP in SFV-infected cells is accompanied by the failure of these cells to form polykaryoc~C6es under conditions which normally do lead to cell-cell fusion. The experiments using inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation dearly showed that blockage of de novo synthesis of ATP in the respiratory chain also prevents polykaryoeyte formation triggered at low pH. The rapid depletion of eellular ATP of infected cells at pH 6 in presence of the inhibitors can be explained by the assumption that most ATP is used to counterbalance the intraeellular pH to its normal level in presence of a large artificial pH gradient across the membrane (manuscript in preparation). When this pH gradient was abolished after a limited time of exposure to low pH in presence of the inhibitory drugs, the cellular ATP concentration recovered to a significant degree depending on the time of exposure to pH 6. This partial restoration of the intraeellular ATP level in presence of inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation can be explained by the fact that ATP cannot only be generated in the process of oxidative phosphorylation but also from other energy-rich compounds by transphosphorylations. It, is noteworthy that these exposure times leading to different depletion levels varied with all inhibitors from experiment, to experiment and were most probably-dependent on the age of the culture. Furthermore, restoration of the intracetlular ATP level was only transient in all experiments. The observed decrease after paI\u00a2ial recovery of the ATP concentration can be explained by the need for ATP in the process of polykaryocyte formation per se and exhaustion of the energy reserves in the cell as mentioned above.",

As a rule, the process of cell-cell fusion was never totally abolished, even at 10 to 20 per cent of the initial ATP level. This ATP concentration corresponds to the maximal depletion achievable by 2-deoxyglucose. The reason why the polykaryoeyte formation was only greatly hampered and delayed but not completely inhibited can be explained by assuming that the residual amount of ATP synthesized by the oxidative phosphorylation, which itself is not blocked under these conditions, was just, sufficient for cell-cell fusion to occur. The possibility that ATP depletion prevents polykaryoeyte formation by blocking viral protein synthesis can be ruled out. KOm, ET and collaborators (11) showed that addition of eyeloheximide 16 hours after infection does not prevent syncytium formation during the next 8 hours,",

Thus, it could be argued that it is not the fusion event itself-which requires ATP but the reorganization of the cellular membranes and the cytoplasms leading to a syneytium. However, we have shown that potassium cyanide inhibits polykaryon formation at a very early stage, namely at the level of membranemembrane fusion (manuscript submitted). Briefly, SFV-infected cells were microinjected with the highly fluorescent, non permeable dye Lucifer yellow 1 minute after exposure to pit 6. Cell-cell fusion at this time could be observed by the spreading of the dye through microscopic connections into neighbouring cells. Concomitant addition of potassium cyanide with the change of the pH from 7 to 6 abolished this early process. Thus, these observations taken together lead to the conclusion that SFV-induced cell-ceil fusion is a process which requires a specific expenditure of energy. Recent reports concerning other thsion phenomena also showed that these processes were energy dependent. A study by HERTEL and coworkers demonstrated the involvement of cellular ATP in receptor mediated endocytosis (7) . DAVE\u00a5 and collaborators showed that endoeytotic fusion events require ATP (2) . Furthermore, it is well known that fusion of secretory granules in chromaffine cells occurs only in presence of Mg-ATP (9) .",
