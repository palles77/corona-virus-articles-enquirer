            "text": "Background: acute otitis media (aOM) is a frequent complication of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). We hypothesized that the severity of nasopharyngeal cellular injury during URI, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDh) concentrations in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPss), is related to aOM complication. Methods: LDh concentrations were determined in NPs samples (n = 594) that were collected at the initial visit for URI from 183 children who were followed for the development of aOM. a subset of NPs samples (n = 134) was analyzed for interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 concentrations. results: aOM complication was independently predicted by LDh concentrations (median mU/ml with aOM = 2,438 vs. without aOM = 1,573; estimate = 0.276; P = 0.02). LDh effect on aOM development was highest during the first 4 d of URI. LDh concentrations were higher in URIs due to adenoviruses, bocaviruses, and rhinoviruses as compared with virus-negative samples (P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between concentrations of LDh and all cytokines (P < 0.001). conclusion: LDh concentrations in NPs are positively associated with aOM risk, suggesting that the severity of nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury during URI contributes to the development of aOM and that reduction of inflammatory injury may reduce the risk for aOM. a cute otitis media (AOM) mostly occurs during or after viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and is highly prevalent among young children (1, 2) . The pathogenesis of AOM is complex and involves interactions among the host, pathogen, and environmental factors. Usually, there is a preexisting nasopharyngeal colonization with pathogenic bacteria. Viral URI causes inflammation of the nasopharynx and eustachian tubes, which is mediated by substances such as cytokines and inflammatory mediators. The inflammation leads to eustachian tube dysfunction, which, in turn, causes a negative pressure in the middle ear, allowing the pathogens from the nasopharynx to enter the middle ear. This results in fluid or pus accumulation, thereby causing AOM (1, 2) . However, although nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury during symptomatic viral URI occurs in all children, AOM complication occurs only in about one-third of young children. It is likely that more severe nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury leads to a higher risk for AOM; however, this postulate has not been studied in the clinical setting.",

(5) have also shown that LDH concentrations in NPS are higher during viral URI than during bacterial, allergic, or atrophic rhinitis. The nasopharyngeal cellular injury can arise from a multitude of factors during viral URI; these include direct virus-induced cytopathic injury of the infected cells and participation of leukocytes such as neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes in both antibody-dependent and antibody-independent cytotoxicity (10) . A variety of chemokines and cytokines, specifically the acutephase cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and other soluble mediators can act on the local endothelial and epithelial tissues to enhance the migration of the leukocytes toward infected epithelial cells, which, in turn, participate in the cytotoxic injury of infected cells as well as nearby bystander cells.",

However, we also show that the median LDH concentrations associated with AOM are higher and equivalent in all the age groups as compared with the URI episodes without AOM, implying that high LDH concentrations beyond a certain threshold reflect AOM risk regardless of age. Nonetheless, the association between LDH concentrations and AOM in older children is weaker than that in younger children. In the previous study of LDH concentrations in NPSs in children with bronchiolitis complication, no relationship of LDH with age was seen (6). However, a majority of the children in the study were younger than 6 mo, and children without bronchiolitis complication were not studied.",

We have previously reported that adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and coronavirus are associated with a higher occurrence of AOM as compared with other viruses (12) .
