            "text": "The phosphorylation of ribavirin to the 5 0 -monophosphate by human adenosine kinase (hADK) is the ratelimiting step for activation to the physiologically relevant triphosphate. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Several mechanisms for ribavirin's antiviral activity have been identified. It inhibits inosine 5 0 -monophosphate dehydrogenase and decreases intra-cellular guanosine triphosphate (GTP) concentrations. 15 This is the predominant mechanism for the antiviral activity of ribavirin against yellow fever, parainfluenza 3, and respiratory syncytial viruses. [16] [17] [18] Other mechanisms of ribavirin's antiviral activity include: (1) inhibition of influenza virus RNA polymerase in vitro with ribavirin triphosphate (RTP), 19, 20 (2) inhibition of viral genome capping through interference with guanyltransferase or methyltransferase activity in Sindbis virus, [21] [22] [23] and (3) modulation of host immune response in HCV infected patients. 24, 25 Recent interest has been focused on increased mutation rates in the viral genome that affect replication, transcription, and virion viability. This has been shown in the case of Hantaan virus, an Old World hantavirus that can produce a life-threatening hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. 26 There is great interest in the development of synthetic nucleoside analogs with modified hydrogen bonding, p-stacking, hydrophobic and steric features to exploit the decreased fidelity of viral replication and transcription. 27, 28 Considering the importance of hADK for metabolic activation of 1, we were interested in evaluating structural effects within a closely related series of 3-substituted-1-b-D D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazoles as part of our ongoing efforts to develop new antiviral drugs for RNA viruses.",

Aliquots of 50 ll were taken at 0-, 1-, 2-, and 4-h intervals, and reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 ll of 1 M perchloric acid. Samples were neutralized to pH 7, and precipitated salts were removed by centrifugation. Reactants and products were separated by HPLC using Bio Basic anion exchange column (Thermo Electron Corp., Bellefonte, PA) with a 40-min linear salt and pH gradient from 5 mM ammonium phosphate (pH 2.8) to 750 mM ammonium phosphate (pH 6).

These results are consistent with the reported conformational preference of 1 in solution as determined by NMR and circular dichroism. 32, 33 The validity of the calculated glycoside conformation of 2 was confirmed experimentally by observation of strong NOE correlation between H5-H1 0 in the NOESY spectrum.

The ribavirin derivatives 4, 7, and 8 were ineffective substrates for hADK, and these results may correlate with the reported lack of antiviral activity against distinct viruses, although metabolism by other enzymatic pathways is not excluded. 30 The isosteric derivatives 2, 3 and N-methyl homolog 5 were phosphorylated by hADK, and the antiviral activity of these compounds is currently under investigation. Consideration of computational descriptors and structural interactions provides insight substrate binding and activity into and provides direction for additional structural optimization for the development of antiviral nucleoside analogs with improved selectivity and reduced side effects.
