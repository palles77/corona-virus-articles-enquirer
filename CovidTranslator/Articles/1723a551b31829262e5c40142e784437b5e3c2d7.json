Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a duplex real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method for the simultaneous detection of these viruses. Primers and probes that target the conserved spike S2 region of human SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and their related bat CoVs were designed. The results of real-time RT-PCR showed specific reactions for each virus with adequate detection limits of 50-100 copies/mL and 5-100 copies/mL using pUC57-SARS-pS2 (a template for SARS-CoV) and pGEM-MERS-S2 (a template for MERS-CoV), respectively. In addition, this real-time RT-PCR system was able to detect the target viruses SARS-like bat CoV and MERS-CoV in bat fecal samples and sputum of MERS patients, respectively. Therefore, this newly developed real-time RT-PCR method is expected to detect not only SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in humans but also several bat CoVs that are closely related to these viruses in bats.",

As these viruses are also closely related to several bat CoVs (SARS-like bat CoVs and MERS-related bat CoVs), the primers and probes were designed based on the conserved region of the spike S2 domains of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and their related bat CoVs. In a previous study, two regions within the spike protein of SARS-CoV were identified that showed a high degree of sequence conservation with those of other CoVs [13] . By applying our new approach, we expected to detect not only SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in humans but also several bat CoVs that are closely related to these viruses. Indeed, the newly developed real-time RT-PCR method could detect SARS-CoV-and MERS-CoV-specific sequences when the plasmids pUC57-SARS-pS2 and pGEM-MERS-S2 were used as templates. In addition, positive results were obtained when RNA extracted from MERS-CoV (KOR/KNIH/002_05_2015), which was isolated from a patient in Korea in 2015 [14] , was used as a template.",
