A comprehensive, but not all-inclusive, list of potentially TTds can be found in Table 66 .1. While bacteria are transmitted by transfusion, it is usually the products of the bacteria in the donor product (endotoxin) rather than the transfer of infectious bacteria that are the cause of posttransfusion bacteria-related complications. For this reason, bacterial contamination of blood products and methods to limit and detect bacteria in platelet products are discussed in Chapters 59 and 17 of this book, respectively.",

Infection in sickle cell disease and thalassemia patients may result in aplastic crisis. In immunocompromised individuals (especially HIV-positive individuals), parvovirus infection may result in aplastic anemia. Infection during pregnancy may result in severe fetal anemia or malformation in the infants. The seropositivity rate in blood donors is 30-60%. It is transmitted either through release of virus from the upper respiratory tract, or parenterally. Viremia appears within the first week and persists for 1-2 weeks; chronic infection does not occur. rare cases of transfusion transmission through blood products have been reported. parvovirus is not destroyed by solvent-detergent treatment or heat inactivation. Because of seroconversion in recipients of solvent-detergent treated plasma, additional viral inactivation steps as well as NAT testing were implemented for plasma that would be pooled and used to manufacture plasma derivatives. infection: Infection is often asymptomatic, and does not result in chronic infection with viremia persisting less than 28 days. The incubation period is approximately 3-14 days followed by a range of symptoms including mild fever, headache, rash, eye pain, vomiting, lymphocytopenia, muscle weakness, flaccid paralysis, poliomyelitis and peripheral demyelination. Approximately 1 in 150 infections results in severe neurologic disease, especially in those over the age of 50 years. prevention is through avoiding mosquitoes and mosquito bites. ",

It is transmitted to humans through the bite of the reduvid bugs, and the lifecycle is split between the two hosts. Acute infections are asymptomatic or mild. rarely, the site of entry evolves into an erythematous nodule called a chagoma; this may be accompanied by fever and hepatosplenomegaly. Younger children may develop acute myocarditis or meningioencephalitis. Acute infection resolves without treatment, but lifelong low-level parasitemia persists. Of chronically infected individuals, 20-40% develop cardiac or gastrointestinal symptoms years to decades later. Transmission through transfusion is the second major source of human infection, especially in endemic areas. Seven cases of transfusion transmission in the US and Canada have been reported. The FdA licensed a screening test for antibodies to T. cruzi in blood donors in 2006. Testing of about 65% of the US blood supply has demonstrated that 1 : 25,000-35,000 donors are confirmed positive, with the majority of infected donors in Florida and California. toxoplasma gondii (Toxoplasmosis): Infection with T. gondii occurs in up to 95% of adults in some countries. Cats and mice are intermediate hosts. Acute infection in healthy individuals is usually asymptomatic, but infection in immunocompromised individuals can result in severe disease with CNS involvement, myocarditis and pneumonia. Congenital infection can give rise to serious complications, including liver, CNS disease, abortion or stillbirth. Acute infection resolves with antibody formation, but the organism remains latent in leukocytes. Transmission by transfusion has been documented in immunocompromised individuals. prevention of transfusion transmission appears possible by leukoreduction, but this has not been evaluated.",

A ban on ruminant protein in cattle feed has resulted in decreased incidence of BSe. In 1995, BSe was transmitted to humans through the food chain and resulted in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJd) in the UK. vCJd differs from classical CJd by an earlier age of onset, slower disease progression, and higher levels of prp Sc in the brain. The disease presents with behavioral changes and dysasthesia, and progresses to cerebellar ataxia, dementia and death in 7-38 months. The majority of cases of vCJd have appeared in the UK, but there have also been reports in other european countries. At least four cases of transfusion transmission of vCJd have occurred in the UK. It is estimated that transfusion transmission by donors who develop vCJd within several years of donation is about 14% for recipients who survive longer than 5 years posttransfusion. prevention includes deferral for donors who have resided in the UK or europe for over 6 months, and the use of filters to remove prions; these remove approximately half the infectivity.",
