            "text": "Background: We performed an assessment of an independent rapid flu clinic service (RFCS) unit, which was set up outside the emergency department (ED) during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic season. The unit was able to relieve the crowding of regular ambulatory and emergency services. Methods: Between August and December 2009, a total of 6,152 patients with influenza-like illness were enrolled in this observational retrospective study. Patients with positive influenza tests were interviewed to evaluate the efficiency of RFCS. Results: The mean length of stay (LOS) for the RFCS was 50 minutes, which was shorter than the LOS for ambulatory services (1 hour) and regular ED services (3.5 hours). Overall, 88% of patients were satisfied with the RFCS. Of 6,152 patients receiving flu tests, 1,235 (20%) had a positive result. Fever (odds ratio [OR], 4.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.11-5.89), fever combined with cough and sore throat (OR, 2.52; 95% CI: 2.18-2.92), fever combined with sore throat (OR, 2.42; 95% CI: 2.13-2.75), history of contacting confirmed flu patients within 7 days (OR, 2.40; 95% CI: 2.07-2.78), fever combined with cough (OR, 2.19; 95% CI: 1.92-2.47), sore throat (OR, 2.03, 95% CI: 1.79-2.30); and cough (OR, 1.91, 95% CI: 1.69-2.17) were significantly associated with positive influenza tests. Conclusion: Setting up the RFSC was beneficial to health care facilities during a pandemic flu season.",

            "text": "In the spring of 2009, a novel H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus (SOIV) originated from North America and rapidly spread to other countries. On June 11, 2009 , the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the worldwide flu pandemic alert to phase 6, characterized by community level outbreaks in at least 1 other country in a different WHO region. 1 Although the mortality and morbidity of H1N1 SOIV were lower than those of the 1918 pandemic flu, the rapid spread of H1N1 SOIV still raised concerns for preparedness of health care systems. 2 The 2009 H1N1 SOIV epidemic was the first opportunity to examine the preparedness plans of health care systems in the 21st century. 2, 3 After the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, many hospitals set up protocols for contagious airborne diseases of high virulence. 4 Most of these protocols focused on infection control measures for health care systems, but few considered an abruptly increased hospital and emergency department (ED) censuses during a pandemic period. Experiences of the SARS outbreak indicated that treating abrupt increases in contagious ambulatory patients in an independent area could alleviate ED crowding and avoid transmissions of nosocomial infections within the ED and other hospital areas. [4] [5] [6] Therefore, a rapid flu clinic service (RFCS) was set up at our nearby hospital ED for 2009 H1N1 SOIV infections after it spread in the community. The protocols, based on experiences from the 2003 SARS epidemic and recommendations from the Center for Disease Control (CDC; Taiwan) and the Bureau of National Health Insurance (NHI) in Taiwan, included adequate health care workers and facilities, an independent area to treat patients, and relevant educational information for family and patients. 7 The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the protocols for an abruptly increased hospital census on the ED during a pandemic period and analyze the responses from patients who went to our RFCS.",

Taiwanese hospitals and health care workers started a series of infection control measures to prevent hospital-acquired infection. The Taiwanese Department of Health, collaborating with the CDC and the Bureau of NHI, suggested rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) as a preliminary diagnostic measure. Patients with positive RIDTs were eligible for a free 5-day dose of antiviral agent oseltamivir. Hospitals were encouraged to set up flu clinics to reduce social interactions between patients with influenza-like illness and other patients, especially from immunocompromised patients. 7 Our hospital is a tertiary hospital located in southern Taiwan, equipped with 1,000 total beds, 100 of which are intensive care unit (ICU) beds. The annual census of the ED was approximately 750,000. The mean length of stay (LOS) at the ED during 2008 was 5.6 hours. The LOS for patients who left after ED management (ie, those who were not admitted after the ED visit) was 3.4 hours. To shorten the unnecessary LOS for flu patients and to follow the national policy, we established the RFCS to provide influenza tests and counseling for the H1N1 SOIV in August 2009.",

Ambulatory patients could stay in the RFCS and have their history taken and undergo physical examination, sputum induction, and nasopharyngeal or throat swab and receive oseltamivir treatment if indicated. Usually, the RFCS ran 24 hours per day and was staffed with 1 physician and 2 nurses. During day shifts (09:00-18:00), the RFCS was staffed with rotating physicians from all clinical departments. During night shifts, emergency physicians (EP) took over the work. Additional physicians were called to the RFCS from the department of internal medicine when the ED was overcrowded, and EPs could be freed from their clinical duties to manage ED patients.",

The National Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale (NEDOCS) was used to further assess our ED during August to November 2009. The NEDOCS is a tool developed in the United States that uses a linear regression model using 5 variables and 6 items including total patients, total admissions, the longest admissions, hospital beds, ventilators, and last bed time at the hospital to quantify emergency department and hospital crowding. Scores over 100 were regarded as overcrowded. 15 During the study period, our ED frequently reached the highest overcrowding level of dangerous or disaster level (NEDOCS > 180).

[28] [29] [30] Under these circumstances, the number of influenza cases could be underestimated. Furthermore, our telephone interviews only covered positive influenza cases; the lack of interviews for negative influenza cases limited the reliability of our RFCS satisfaction surveys. The lack of patients with neuropsychiatric adverse effects in our study is probably due to the low response rate for questionnaires. During our study period, no obvious neuropsychiatric adverse effects were reported to our hospital's drug adverse effect system nor were they reported from phone interviews (even though nearly 56% of cases enrolled in this study were young patients). Many patients did not answer their phones after ED visits, even though those patients provided telephone numbers to receive notifications of their influenza test results. Those patients who answered our phone survey might only reflect part of the status results from oseltamivir administration. Whether or not oseltamivir only causes neuropsychiatric adverse effects in the Japanese population still needs further studies.",
