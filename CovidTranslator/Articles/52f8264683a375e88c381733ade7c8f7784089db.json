The AES is an artificial enzyme subunit composed of an enzyme-inhibiting aptamer bearing a target-molecule binding site. We connected a probe DNA to a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer at its 5 0 or 3 0 end. The inhibitory activity of the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer bearing the probe DNA decreased compared to that of the original aptamer; however, it recovered upon hybridization with the target DNA. Using this AES, we were able to detect target DNAs by measuring the thrombin activity in a homogeneous solution.",

Designed probe DNAs modified fluorescent dyes have been used mainly in homogeneous DNA sensing: molecular beacons (Tyagi et al. 1996) , double-stranded probes (Li et al. 2002) , excimer fluorescence (Masuko et al. 1998 ), light-up probe (Isacsson et al. 2000) , fluorescent polymers (Ho et al. 2002) , and DNAzymes (Wang et al. 2001; Stojanovic et al. 2001; Xiao et al. 2004; Tian et al. 2006 ). However, the use of enzymes can improve the sensitivity of detection since enzymes can amplify the detection signals through enzymatic reactions. At present, there are DNA sensing systems which use enzymes for homogeneous assays (Saghatelian et al. 2003; Pavlov et al. 2005) ; however, the inhibitors and probe DNAs must be covalently attached to the enzymes.",

Aptamers are nucleic acid ligands which can bind their target molecules with high affinity and specificity (Ellington et al. 1990; Tuerk et al. 1990) . A target-molecule-binding aptamer was inserted into an enzyme-inhibiting aptamer to enable the change of the structure of an enzyme-inhibiting aptamer upon the recognition of the target molecule. Therefore the inhibitory activity of the AES was changed by binding to the target molecule, that is, we can detect the target molecule by measuring the corresponding enzymatic activity in a homogeneous solution.",

Secondary structure predictions carried out using the mfold program (Zuker et al. 2003 ) yielded a number of possible structures for each AES invA, all of which may be present in solution. We classified the secondary AES structure into two states. One is the native thrombin-inhibiting aptamer structure which bears the connected probe DNA at its end; the other is a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer structure disrupted by the hybridization of the connected probe DNA with the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer site. AES invA 5 0 36, 5 0 27, 5 0 18 and 3 0 27 (AES invA 5 0 36 is the thrombininhibiting aptamer which bears the 36-mer probe DNA at the 5 0 end; the other AESs were named in the same way) were predicted to fold into both of these two states. In contrast, AES invA 3 0 36 and 3 0 18 were predicted to fold into only one state, the native thrombin-inhibiting aptamer structure.

In the presence of thrombin only, the clotting time was approximately 10 s ( Fig. 2A, lane 1) ; the addition of the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer led to the extension of the clotting time to approximately 110 s, as it inhibited thrombin activity (lane 2). The clotting times were approximately 75, 68, 86, and 52 s in the presence of AES invA 5 0 36, 5 0 27, 5 0 18 and 3 0 27, respectively (lanes 3, 5, 7 and 11); however, they increased to 129, 124, 119 and 113 s, respectively  (lanes 4, 6, 8 and 12) , upon the addition of the target DNAs. These results indicate that they have a lower thrombin-inhibitory capacity than the original thrombin-inhibiting aptamer; however, their lost inhibitory capacity can be recovered by the addition of their target DNAs. AES invA 5 0 36, 5 0 27, 5 0 18 and 3 0 27 did not lose their inhibitory activity completely. These results show that there was an equilibrium between the native thrombin-inhibiting aptamer structure and some of the disrupted thrombininhibiting aptamer structures, and that the equilibrium shifted to the native thrombin-inhibiting aptamer state upon hybridization with the target DNAs. These experiments were performed using 1 lM aptamer, 1 lM target DNA, 54 nM thrombin and 1 mg/ml fibrinogen at 37\u00b0C. Lane 1, thrombin only; lane 2, thrombin-inhibiting aptamer; lanes 3 and 4, AES which has a 36-mer probe DNA at its 5 0 end; lanes 5 and 6, AES which has a 27-mer probe DNA at its 5 0 end; lanes 7 and 8, AES which has an 18-mer probe DNA at its 5 0 end; lanes 9 and 10, AES which has a 36-mer probe DNA at its 3 0 end; lanes 11 and 12, AES which has a 27-mer probe DNA at its 3 0 end; lanes 13 and 14, AES which has an 18-mer probe DNA at its 3 0 end.

The clotting times are given as averages of three experiments, and error bars are provided Biotechnol Lett (2008) 30:243-252 247 AES invA 3 0 36 and 3 0 18 were not expected to lose their thrombin-inhibitory capacity, since they were predicted to only form the native thrombin-inhibiting aptamer structure. However, their thrombin-inhibitory activities were lower than that of the original thrombininhibiting aptamer, and their lost inhibitory activities recovered upon the addition of their target DNAs ( Fig. 2A, lanes 9, 10, 13 and 14) . The inhibitory activities of AES invA 3 0 36 and 3 0 18 in the absence of their target DNAs were higher than that of AES invA 3 0 27. These results indicate that AES invA 3 0 36 and 3 0 18 fold into both native and disrupted thrombininhibiting aptamer structures but have a higher level of native structure than AES invA 3 0 27. This implies that this DNA sensing system can be effectively applied to target DNAs whose probe DNAs do not hybridize with the part of the AES containing the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer site. Therefore, we expect that this DNA sensing system can be applied to many DNA sequences.",

Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) methylates the N7 of guanine; however, an oligonucleotide folded into a G-quartet structure is protected from N7 methylation, since the N7 of one guanine forms a hydrogen bond with the N2 of another guanine to form a G-quartet structure. The DMS footprinting assay was performed on FITC-labeled AES invA 3 0 27, FITClabeled AES invA 3 0 27 hybridized with its target DNA, and FITC-labeled thrombin-inhibiting aptamer in the presence or absence of potassium ions. In the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, the potassium ions are necessary for G-quartet structure folding. Therefore, as shown Fig. 5 , the guanine residues composing the G-quartet structure (G9, G10, G13, G14, G18, G19, G22 and G23) of the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer were exposed to N7 methylation in the absence of potassium ions (lanes 1 and 2). In AES invA 3 0 27, the guanine residues composing the G-quartet structure were exposed to N7 methylation in the presence or absence of potassium ions (lanes 3 and 4). However, these residues were protected from N7 methylation by the hybridization with the target DNA, although protection from N7 methylation was not detected when control DNA was added (lanes 5 and 6). These results also indicate that the folding of AES invA 3 0 27 into a G-quartet structure is induced by the hybridization of the 27-mer invA with AES invA 3 0 27.",

Under these conditions, the clotting time was approximately 36 s in the presence of thrombin only (data not shown). The addition of 30 nM AES invA 3 0 27 led to the extension of the clotting time to approximately 54 s. An increase in the clotting time from 54 s to 84 s was observed with the increase in the concentration of the target DNA to 30 nM, and when target DNA at concentrations higher than 30 nM was added, the clotting time became saturated (Fig. 6) . The thrombin-inhibiting activity was not influenced by the Calibration graph for the 27-mer invA target DNA using the AES invA 3 0 27. These experiments were performed using 30 nM AES 3 0 27 invA, 13.5 nM thrombin and 1 mg/ml fibrinogen. The clotting times are given as averages of three experiments, and error bars are provided addition of the control DNA. This calibration graph indicates that the target DNA of AES invA 3 0 27 was selectively detected by measuring the thrombin enzymatic activity in a homogeneous solution, and that the lower limit of target DNA detection was 10 nM. When we used 1 lM AES invA 3 0 27, the dynamic range extended from 0.1 lM to 1 lM (data not shown). The clotting time was saturated when AES invA 3 0 27 and its target DNA reached the same concentration. This result indicates that AESs bind to their target DNAs at a ratio of one to one, and that the dynamic range can be changed by changing the concentration of the AESs.",

In this study, we used a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer; however, the sensitivity of the sensing system can be improved if a more suitable enzyme-inhibiting aptamer is developed for this sensing system. (2) AES does not require any modification. Although Saghatelian et al. (2003) and Pavlov et al. (2005) developed DNA sensing methods that use enzyme to detect the target DNA, these systems need to connect the probe DNA to the enzyme and the enzyme inhibitor. Enzyme modification usually results in significant loss of activity and requires a cumbersome process of enzyme preparation. In contrast, AES can be constructed very easily since AES is simply an oligonucleotide.",
