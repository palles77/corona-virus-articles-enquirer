These codons are organism specific codons because different organisms have different tRNA gene compositions. For example, 13 amino acid-encoding codons have no cognate tRNA genes in the human genome. Studies have revealed by ribosomal profiling experiments that translation of codons by rare tRNAs and non-cognate isoacceptor tRNAs (by wobble base pairing of codons and tRNAs) reduces translation efficiency 2,3, . 4 Moreover, it has been reported that the efficiency of translating a particular codon is affected by the nature of the immediately adjacent codons. 5, 6 Two consecutive slow codons (slow di-codons) lead to a much slower translation rate.

According to variations of codon compositions, the HKU1 and SARS were divided into 2 subgroups. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomic sequences of the representative coronavirus from each group is shown in Fig. 1A . Analysis results of the genetic codon compositions of 8 coronavirus groups (and subgroups) infect humans are shown in Fig. 1B . Comparison of Fig. 1A and B shows that the analysis based on the phylogenetic tree and viral genetic codon compositions are not completely consistent. For example, although NL63 and HKU1 belong to alpha and beta coronaviruses, respectively, they exhibit similar codon compositions. These results indicate that the analysis of genetic codon composition provides novel information that cannot be revealed in the phylogenetic analysis. It is interesting that the codon compositions of The distribution of overall proportions of human slow codons and slow di-codons in the coding sequences from 590 coronaviruses isolated from human hosts is shown in Fig. 2 . The order of overall proportions of human slow codons and slow di-codons is SARS2 < SARS1 < SARS-CoV-2 < unclassified y MERS < HKU1_2 y 229 E < OC43 < HKU1_1 < NL63. These results indicate that the SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV may have higher protein synthetic rates than other coronavirus groups which infect humans. Herfst et al. 11 propose a set of drivers facilitating human-to-human transmission of airborne pathogens with the aerosols and droplets as mediators in airspace between individuals (Fig. 4) . First, the airborne pathogens are carried with aerosols, droplets, or particulate matter, such as PM2.5, and transported through the air from donor to recipient. Second, airborne pathogens usually exhibit a relatively low 50% infectious dose (ID50) value. A low concentration of pathogens is sufficient for infection in the respiratory tract of the recipients. Third, after infection of susceptible cells, pathogens may amplify at the site of deposition or are disseminated from the primary deposition site to peripheral tissues (secondary site), where additional amplification takes place. Fourth, eventually, the recipient becomes the donor, and pathogens are expelled from the exit site (usually the respiratory tract). High infectious loads of the pathogens re-emerge in the air to complete the transmission cycle. According to the 4 steps, viruses with high protein synthesis rates (as a consequence, replication rates) have great advantages to increase transmissibility.

Composition of human-specific slow codons and slow di-codons 3 Two analysis were conducted to check if the observed phenomena are random events. First, regression of Ct and DiC values were performed. The R 2 values of regression of Ct and DiC values by exponential regression, polynomial regression, and linear regression are 0.986, 0.9844 and 0.9729, respectively. The result of exponential regression is shown inFig. 3A. The non-linear relationship between slow codon and slow di-codon compositions suggests the observed phenomena may be not random events. Second, the overall proportions of amino acids associated with human specific slow codons in viral proteins were computed. As shown inFig. 3B, the order of the proportions of amino acids associated with human specific slow codons in viral proteins were not consistent with the order of overall proportions of human slow codons and slow dicodons in viral CDSs. These results suggest that lower proportions of human slow codons and slow di-codons are not completely due to lower demand of amino acids in viral proteins.DiscussionSARS-CoV was the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. The disease emerged in late 2002 in the Guangdong Province of China. During the epidemic in 2003, 8096 cases with 774 deaths occurred in 27 countries. 9 For 2019-nCoV, over 24,552 confirmed cases and 492 deaths in 28 countries have been reported from mid-Dec. 2019 to February 4 2020. In contrast, the MERS-CoV outbreak, sporadic cases, small clusters, and large outbreaks have been reported in 27 countries, with over 2254 cases of the virus and over 800 deaths. 10 The order of transmission rates (2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV > MERS-CoV > other coronaviruses infect",
