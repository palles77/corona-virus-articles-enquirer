Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily 31 routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and 32 Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease 33 progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast 34 (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 35 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal 36 hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (>77%) and considered 37 effective (>90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers 38 for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New 39 Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and 40 being more anxious (aOR:1.07). 41 42 Discussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert 43 to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the 44 psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the 45 early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of 46 the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the 47 epidemic progresses.",

In parallel, the WHO formally named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as 57 \"COVID-19\", short for Coronavirus Disease 2019. Back in late December 2019, a cluster of 27 58 pneumonia cases associated with SARS-CoV-2 with a common link to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale 59 Market were reported [1] , and the first death case attributable to SARS-CoV-2 occurred on 9 January 60 2020. Soon after the first global incidence was confirmed in Thailand on 12 January 2020, new cases 61 were reported in different countries and were mostly associated with Wuhan travel history or residency.

Whether individuals 86 voluntarily engage in precautionary behaviors depends on their risk perception towards the current 87 health threat. In fact, risk perception is a main theme in common health behavior theories, including 88 Health Belief Model and Protection Motivation Theory. In addition, with advanced information 89 technology in recent years comes the uncertainty of how risk perception is shaped by various 90 information sources. Hong Kong's past experience with outbreaks of novel pathogens (2003 Severe 91 Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and 2009 Pandemic Influenza) also provides a reference point to 92 evaluate the risk perceptions of the current COVID-19 epidemic. 93 94 In light of the importance of host behavior in mitigating transmission and the vision to inform policy 95 formation in a timely manner, this study aims to examine risk perceptions and behavioral responses of 96 the general community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic.

With the high perceived risk and large proportion of individuals adopting 249 preventive measures in the community at the beginning, during which the accumulated number of local 250 cases is 68 (as of 21 February 2020) with a significant initial portion of them being imported cases [18], 251 we have an edge to block local transmission.

For emotional status, the HADS-264 A score in our survey (9.01) suggests that the community was borderline abnormal in terms of anxiety.265 Despite the slight difference in the inclusion of measurement items, the community was seemingly more 266 anxious about the current COVID-19 epidemic (mean STAI score=2.00) than the 2009 pandemic 267 influenza (mean STAI score = 1.8) [22], but was less worried than the SARS outbreak in 2003 (mean 268 STAI score = 2.24) [23]. The significant time trend associated with HADS-A (Figure 2) suggests that 269 the community became more and more anxious as new cases and new incidences came up (Figure 1). 270 271 Third, our results suggest an alternative strategy for better risk communication. The large proportion of 272 respondents were alert to COVID-19 (99.5%) or actively searching for related information (83%) 273 highlighted the role of social media in shaping risk perception and epidemic-related emotion. It is 274 particularly important amid of much disease uncertainty as mass scares can be triggered easily. 275 Considering the high level of trust given by respondents to doctors and the low level of trust to the two 276 most frequently used information sources, social platform and websites, health officials can collaborate 277 frequently with associations of medical doctors, and invite them to help propagating official information278",
