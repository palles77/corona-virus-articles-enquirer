He was seen 3 days prior for a well child check where a complete blood count drawn revealed a white blood cell count of 35 000/\u03bcL. Upon arrival to the ED, the infant was noted to be in mild respiratory distress. He had a rectal temperature of 37.3\u00b0C, a heart rate of 176 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 48 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry was 53% on room air.",

            "text": "Viral bronchiolitis is one of the most common causes of hypoxia and respiratory distress in infants, especially in the fall and winter. Bronchiolitis is a lower airway disease mostly affecting the bronchioles, causing acute inflammation, edema, increased mucus production, and bronchospasm. Viral bronchiolitis typically presents with upper respiratory symptoms followed by lower respiratory infection resulting in wheezing and rales in children younger than two years of age. Common pathogens of viral bronchiolitis include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, adenovirus, and coronavirus. Findings on a chest radiograph are almost always nonspecific but may include hyperinflation, peribronchial thickening, and patchy atelectasis. Bronchiolitis is therefore a clinical diagnosis; quality improvement guidelines typically discourage the routine use of imaging. The causative agent may be confirmed by antigen detection or immunofluorescence of respiratory secretions, and treatment is mainly supportive. 1 Pneumonia is another common cause of hypoxia and respiratory distress in children and can be the result of both bacterial and viral infections. Patients often present with cough and fever, and may also present with tachypnea, hypoxia, or respiratory distress. Physical exam may reveal crackles, decreased breath sounds over areas of consolidation, rhonchi, or wheezing. Though viral pneumonia is more common in infants, bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptoccocus pyogenes may also cause pneumonia in infants, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most common pathogen. Chest radiograph typically reveals a focal area of consolidation. In older school-",

A variety of illnesses including pulmonary infections, inhalation of toxic fumes, rheumatologic diseases, bone marrow or heart and lung transplantation causes inflammation and fibrosis in the bronchioles, which leads to concentric luminal narrowing. Physical examination typically reveals fine crackles on auscultation. Chest radiograph may reveal scattered, bilateral alveolar opacities and ground glass opacification, non-segmental consolidations, or nodules. However, due to nonspecific findings on standard chest imaging, high-resolution computed tomography is usually performed prior to lung biopsy to establish the diagnosis. Treatment is with glucocorticoids. 2 Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is another reason for hypoxia in infants. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least half a million children develop tuberculosis annually worldwide. Risk for tuberculosis increases with being foreign born, close contact with a person with tuberculosis, homelessness, using injection drugs, living in a correctional facility or nursing home, or working in the hospital. Pulmonary tuberculosis presents with chronic cough, fever, and failure to thrive. Diagnosis is made with history of recent close contact, positive tuberculin skin test, and chest radiograph findings, which may demonstrate lymphadenopathy, infiltrate, consolidations, or cavitations. Sputum microscopy is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, but difficult to obtain in children. Treatment for active tuberculosis disease consists of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for a total of 6 to 9 months. 3 Bordetella pertussis, also known as \"whooping cough\", is a contagious respiratory disease that is vaccine preventable. Pertussis typically presents with cold-like symptoms in the catarrhal phase for 1-2 weeks followed by the paroxysmal phase, which is characterized by coughing fits and gasping or whooping that can last from 1 to 10 weeks. Finally, patients enter the convalescent phase that lasts 2-3 weeks. However, infants with pertussis may present atypically. They may present with feeding difficulty, tachypnea, apnea, post-tussive emesis, and cough, which may or may not be followed by the classic \"whoop\". Chest radiographs may show perihilar infiltrates, peribronchial cuffing, or may appear to be normal. Diagnosis is made clinically but may be confirmed with culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Pertussis is treated with azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin.",

CPAM is caused by branching morphogenesis abnormalities in the lung resulting in cystic and adenomatous lesions in the tracheal, bronchial, bronchiolar, or alveolar tissue. If not discovered during prenatal ultrasound, most patients present in the neonatal period with respiratory distress, recurrent pneumonia, and cyanosis. Chest radiograph may appear normal and the diagnosis may be missed. Chest computed tomography may show small and large air or fluid filled cysts. Treatment of symptomatic CPAM is surgical resection. 4 Methemoglobinemia is another cause of cyanosis and can be congenital or acquired. In congenital methemoglobinemia, there is a deficiency in the hemoglobin structure or abnormalities in key enzymes that reduce naturally occurring methemoglobin. Type II congenital methemoglobinemia is a more severe form in which all cells are affected, and patients may present with cyanosis, mental retardation, developmental delay, and failure to thrive. Acquired methemoglobinemia can be due to stress or exogenous causes including environmental and drug exposures. Patients can present with cyanosis, dyspnea, lethargy, or irritability, which can lead to respiratory depression, altered mental status, shock, seizures, and death. Methemoglobinemia is characterized by cyanosis in the setting of normal oxygen saturation and the blood of affected patients has been described as dark red, chocolate, or brown in color.
