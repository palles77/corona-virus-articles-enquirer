Although rotavirus was extensively studied in China, few comprehensive studies of all viral agents related to diarrhea in children have been conducted. Objectives: Our study was performed to investigate the role of enteric viruses in acute diarrhea in our country and to evaluate methods that could be used in routine diagnostics. Study design: One hundred stool samples were collected from children under 5 years of age seeking medical care for acute diarrhea during the winter season 2000/2001 in Beijing Children's Hospital. All specimens were initially screened microscopically for leucocytes/red blood cells. Samples with negative results were analyzed for virus presence using commercial EIAs and/or in-house RT-PCRs. Results: At least one viral agent was found in 67% of the specimens. The frequency of rotavirus, astrovirus, norovirus and enteric adenovirus was 59%, 8%, 6% and 2%, respectively. Dual infections were found in 9.0% (6/67) of the positive samples. The results from rotavirus and astrovirus EIAs were concordant with those of rotavirus and astrovirus RT-PCRs. Conclusions: Enteric viruses play an important role in pediatric diarrhea during the winter season in China. A combination of microscopic examination of stool samples with specific EIA assays to detect virus antigen in stool specimens may be suitable for routine diagnostics.",

            "text": "Several different groups of viruses have been shown to be responsible for the high incidence of acute viral diarrhea among children during their first few years of life. Four major categories of viruses are now recognized as clinically important including rotavirus, astrovirus, adenovirus and calicivirus (Wilhelmi et al., 2003) . Rotavirus is the single most important etiological agent in severe dehydrating diarrhea. Each year, rotavirus causes approximately 111 million episodes of gastroenteritis requiring only home care, 25 million clinic visits, 2 million hospitalizations and 440,000 deaths in children under 5 years of age (Parashar et al., 2003) . Astrovirus has only recently been recognized as a common cause of diarrhea in children. Currently, eight serotypes of astrovirus have been reported. They are responsible for 2.5% to 9% of cases hospitalized with diarrhea (Glass et al., 1996) . A limited number of adenovirus strains have been associated with childhood diarrhea, types 40 and 41. Enteric adenovirus types 40/41 have been identified in up to 7.9% cases of diarrhea in children (Bon et al., 1999; Grimwood et al., 1995; Giordano et al., 2001; Qiao et al., 1999; Simpson et al., 2003) . Human caliciviruses including norovirus and sapovirus are recognized as the main agents responsible for food-borne and nosocomial outbreaks of non-bacterial diarrhea. Recent studies investigating calicivirus in sporadic cases of gastroenteritis in children have concluded that caliciviruses comprise the second cause of viral diarrhea after rotavirus. (Bereciartu et al., 2002; Bon et al., 1999; Kirkwood and Bishop, 2001; Pang et al., 2000; Simpson et al., 2003; Subekti et al., 2002) .",

Our study, performed during a winter season from December 2000 to March 2001 in Beijing, revealed that 67% of the outpatients under 5 years of age with nonleukocyte diarrhea were infected with at least one viral agent and of which 59% were infected with rotavirus. A prospective population-based surveillance in a rural county and a prospective hospital-based surveillance at three sentinel hospitals for rotavirus diarrhea among children under 5 years of age in China showed that rotavirus was identified in 51% of inpatients tested, 29% of outpatients, and 9.5% of children treated by village doctors (Fang et al., 2004) . The high detection rate in our study may have at least two reasons. Firstly, our study was performed during a winter season, which is the peak season of viral diarrhea in temperate regions; secondly, the exclusion of samples with white or red blood cells before analysis for viral causes. Previous reports have found that examination of stool samples for leukocyte and blood is a rapid, reliable, and inexpensive way to differentiate between invasive bacterial and other causes of acute diarrhea (Alvarado, 1983; Siegel et al., 1987) . A simple method as microscopic examination might still potentially be practical and economical in developing countries and regions where both bacterial and non-bacterial agents play important roles in acute diarrhea.",

As previously reported, co-infections with astrovirus and rotavirus did not result in more severe symptoms than that with astrovirus as the only cause of infection (Herrmann et al., 1991) .

The results obtained from EIA matched very well with that from the RT-PCR for both viruses. RT-PCR assays are used more and more frequently in large scale investigations to understand the epidemiological features of viral diarrhea among children. This is done not only because it is at least by some investigators considered to be more sensitive than EM and EIA (Buesa et al., 1996; Mitchell et al., 1995) , but also because it can be used to further genotype and compare the homogeneity of the circulating virus strains in different years and regions. However, our study indicates that EIA, which is easier to perform, faster and cheaper than RT-PCR, may in this setting be sufficiently sensitive and suitable for routine diagnostic work. Also other investigators have shown that although the RT-PCR may be more sensitive than EIA this may not be relevant in routine diagnostics since large amounts of viral particles, adequate for antigen detection by EIA, are shed in feces during a virus-induced diarrhea (Buesa et al., 1996) .",
