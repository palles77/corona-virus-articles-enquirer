            "text": "Background During each winter the hospital quality of care (QoC) in pediatric wards decreases due to a surge in pediatric infectious diseases leading to overcrowded units. Bed occupancy rates often surpass the good hospital bed management threshold of 85%, which can result in poor conditions in the workplace. This study explores how QoCscores could be improved by investing in additional beds and/or better vaccination programs against vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. Methods The Cobb-Douglas model was selected to define the improvement in QoC (%) as a function of two strategies (rotavirus vaccination coverage [%] and addition of extra hospital beds [% of existing beds]), allowing improvementisocurves to be produced. Subsequently, budget minimization was applied to determine the combination of the two strategies needed to reach a given QoC improvement at the lowest cost. Data from Jessa Hospital (Hasselt, Belgium) were chosen as an example. The annual population in the catchment area to be vaccinated was 7000 children; the winter period was 90 days with 34 pediatric beds available. Rotavirus vaccination cost per course was \u20ac118.26 and the daily cost of a pediatric bed was \u20ac436.53. The target QoC increase was fixed at 50%. The model was first built with baseline parameter values. Results The model predicted that a combination of 64% vaccine coverage and 39% extra hospital beds (& 13 extra beds) in winter would improve QoC-scores by 50% for the minimum budget allocation. Conclusion The model allows determination of the most efficient allocation of the healthcare budget between rotavirus vaccination and bed expansion for improving QoCscores during the annual epidemic winter seasons.",

Respiratory diseases and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) peak during winter leading to overcrowded pediatric wards with high bed occupancy rates exceeding 85% on average, which is the threshold for operating efficiently in hospital bedmanagement [1] [2] [3] . The temporary shock in bed-demand reduces the quality of care (QoC) because of high occupancies, discharges, and unplanned returns of patients but also because of stress in healthcare workers expressed through sick leave, extra working hours, and the enrollment of interim workers [4] . Among the covariates underlying the two principal factors (bed-and staff-management) defining the hospital QoC-scores, high bed occupancy is the main driver [4] . In addition, a high concentration of infections in hospital care will result in increased nosocomial infections and in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

Among these covariates, bed occupancy was found to be the main driver of the QoC-score [4] .

Using the aforementioned data and the baseline parameter values, Fig. 2 shows the solution of the budget optimization model described by Eq. 4. To reach a 50% improvement in hospital QoC-score the minimum budget between rotavirus vaccination and rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) treatment covers a combination of 63.51% vaccine coverage (V) and 39.36% extra hospital beds (H) (? 13 extra beds) during the winter peak.

However, the QoC-scores of the pediatric ward in the Belgian study improved by more than 100% after introducing the vaccine [4] . Vaccination alone could therefore easily be sufficient to reach the improvement level proposed in our exercise. Our analysis is thus quite conservative. However, the purpose of the exercise is to demonstrate new ways of presenting the economic value of vaccine prevention as opposed to extra treatment, solving an existing and specific healthcare problem [27] . It gives the decision maker another analysis framework when he/she needs to invest in one or another option for achieving specific healthcare goals. The results of the exercise indicate that increased childhood vaccination could prevent or even reduce pediatric treatment care. This is now reflected in rotavirus vaccination post-implementation data, showing that when current-day pricing and herd effects are accounted for, the vaccination is cost effective and can even be cost saving [28] . The trade-off between vaccination and adding extra beds may in the future become the trade-off between vaccination and bed reduction in order to improve the QoC at a reasonable extra cost if more vaccination options against other infections are available.",

In the analysis presented here, the labour component of the original function has been replaced by prevention. The reason for doing this is twofold. First, the cost of an extra bed includes medical staff costs. Second, as shown in Fig. 5 , there is a significant decrease in AGE-related bed occupancy rates after the introduction of rotavirus vaccination. Combining these factors using a multivariate power function, such as the Cobb-Douglas one, seemed appropriate since vaccination and extra hospital beds interact together and may have a significantly positive, eventually diminishing, marginal impact on hospital QoC-scores.",

Changing V and H by the same positive factor would result in an exactly proportional change in output.

Moreover, starting each year from a no vaccination situation seems reasonable as the rotavirus epidemic takes place every year during each winter period, and the vaccination of each new birth cohort each year must be maintained.

The model could handle multiple variables simultaneously, introducing other relevant factors, including interactions, which could be another possibility for further research development [33] . Other specifications such as generalized additive models (GAMs) or transcendental logarithmic (translog) functions could also be considered to contrast with the function we have here, avoiding making explicit assumptions on factor and scale returns.
