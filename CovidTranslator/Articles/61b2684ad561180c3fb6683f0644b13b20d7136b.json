Although FFPE tissues can be used to detect known viral sequences, the application of FFPE tissues for detection of novel viruses is currently unclear. In the present study it was shown that sequence-independent amplification in combination with next-generation sequencing can be used to detect sequences of known and unknown viruses, although with relatively low sensitivity. These findings indicate that this technique could be useful for detecting novel viral sequences in FFPE tissues collected from humans and animals with disease of unknown origin, when other samples are not available. In addition, application of this method to FFPE tissues allows to correlate with the presence of histopathological changes in the corresponding tissue sections.",

The use of formalin fixation allows preservation of tissues at room temperature while maintaining structures of cells and other components. Formalin fixes mainly by cross-linking of macromolecules, including DNA and RNA (Srinivasan et al., 2002) , which complicates the extraction of intact DNA and RNA from FFPE tissues. However, novel techniques have been developed to extract nucleic acids from FFPE tissues and have allowed to detect known viral sequences in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. An interesting example is the recovery of the 1918 'Spanish' influenza http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.02.002 0166-0934/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. A/H1N1 virus (Tumpey et al., 2005; Taubenberger et al., 1997) . Using RNA extracted from a FFPE lung tissue sample of a victim of the 1918 pandemic, this virus could be characterized and subsequently recovered by reverse genetics (Tumpey et al., 2005; Taubenberger et al., 1997) . In addition to the recovery of the 1918 influenza A virus, sequences of various other known viruses were detected in FFPE tissues using recently developed techniques (Cimino et al., 2014; Baldwin et al., 2014; Duncavage et al., 2011) .",

In tissue of herring gull two, 170 reads were detected that were related most closely to various gene segments of viruses belonging to the genus Rotavirus (subfamily Sedoreovirinae, family Reoviridae) ( Fig. 2A) . Among these 170 reads, there was one contig of 570 nucleotides consisting of in total six reads that was related most closely to segment 6, which encodes the inner capsid protein VP6.

            "text": "In the present study, the use of sequence-independent amplification in combination with next-generation sequencing to detect known and unknown viruses in FFPE tissues was evaluated. Using FFPE tissues from ferrets and herring gulls that were infected with either RNA viruses or DNA viruses, it was demonstrated that sequences of both known RNA and DNA viruses could be detected. In addition, this approach also allowed detection of a novel RNA virus, a rotavirus. These findings highlight the potential value of this technique in the identification of novel viral sequences in humans and animals with disease of presumed viral origin, for which only FFPE samples are available. The advantage of FFPE samples is that they are the most commonly collected and banked samples during pathological examination of people or animals that have died, that once embedding in paraffin takes place, the fixation process is stopped and the tissue remains in a stable state, and that samples may be kept indefinitely at room temperature. Furthermore, because FFPE samples have been produced in order to allow histopathological evaluation of tissues, any newly discovered virus can be directly correlated to the presence and character of histopathological changes in the tissue from which the viral RNA or DNA was obtained.",

            "text": "A drawback of the present approach was that only a limited number of influenza A virus and adenovirus reads were detected, despite the presence of relatively high viral loads as detected by real time (RT-) PCR. These findings suggest that the combination of sequence-independent amplification and next-generation sequencing is rather insensitive compared to real time (RT-) PCR in FFPE tissues, which is in contrast to previous observations indicating a sensitivity approaching the sensitivity of real time (RT-) PCR in unfixed respiratory samples (Prachayangprecha et al., 2014) . This insensitivity in FFPE tissues may be due to the impossibility to increase the relative amount of viral RNA and DNA by depletion of host nucleic acids with endonucleases, which is considered crucial for viral metagenomics studies (Delwart, 2013; Allander et al., 2001; Ng et al., 2009) . The amount of viral reads could potentially be increased by selecting exactly the site of the lesion for RNA and DNA extraction and not the complete tissue section. This approach could be especially useful for well-demarcated, focal lesions, or for tissue changes that are characteristic for the presence of a virus infection, such as viral inclusion bodies. Another approach could be to apply a different sequencing platform (e.g. Illumina) which sequences to a higher depth and could increase the absolute number of viral reads.",

However, only minor differences in sequence length were observed between FFPE tissue and control samples in the present study. In addition, various other currently available deep-sequencing technologies produce only relatively shorter reads and for these applications the presence of a reduced number of large reads does not have any impact. Furthermore, the accuracy of deep sequencing on FFPE tissues was evaluated. After stringent quality trimming, most obtained viral taxonomic units for adeno-and influenza viruses and the partial VP6 gene of gull rotavirus had an error rate of 1% or less compared to the viral sequence in the tissue, which is similar to the error rate of 454 sequencing of nucleic acids extracted from other sample sources (Gilles et al., 2011; Shao et al., 2013) .",
