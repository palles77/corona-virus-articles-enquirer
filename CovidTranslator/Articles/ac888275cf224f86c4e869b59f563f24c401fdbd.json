To investigate the epidemiology and genetic diversity of these coronaviruses, we conducted a longitudinal surveillance in fruit bats in Yunnan province, China during 2009-2016. A total of 59 (10.63%) bat samples were positive for the two betacorona-viruses, 46 (8.29%) for HKU9 and 13 (2.34%) for GCCDC1, or closely related viruses. We identified a novel HKU9 strain, tentatively designated as BatCoV HKU9-2202, by sequencing the full-length genome. The BatCoV HKU9-2202 shared 83% nucleotide identity with other BatCoV HKU9 stains based on whole genome sequences. The most divergent region is in the spike protein, which only shares 68% amino acid identity with BatCoV HKU9. Quantitative PCR revealed that the intestine was the primary infection organ of BatCoV HKU9 and GCCDC1, but some HKU9 was also detected in the heart, kidney, and lung tissues of bats. This study highlights the importance of virus surveillance in natural reservoirs and emphasizes the need for preparedness against the potential spill-over of these viruses to local residents living near bat caves.",

Based on the genetic distance and serological characterization, the family consists of four genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses (https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictvreports/ictv_online_report/introduction/). Coronaviruses are important human pathogens that cause outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (de Groot et al. 2013; Drosten et al. 2003) . Six human coronaviruses have been identified: human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Hu et al. 2015) . HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 are widespread in human populations and known to cause mild respiratory disease, while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV had led to pandemics (Channappanavar and Perlman 2017) . Stronger evidence showed that the direct ancestor of SARS-CoV, and likely MERS-CoV, originated in bats.",

According to dietary differences, bats are distinguished as insectivores and frugivores (Stuckey et al. 2017) . Frugivore bats are ideal bushmeat because of huge body and thick-flesh for local people in some districts in Africa and Southeast Asia (Mickleburgh et al. 2009 ). Meanwhile, frugivore bats in African or Pacific countries harbor diversity of virulent viruses, such as marburgvirus, hendra virus, and nipha virus (Shi 2013) . In China, crossreactive antibody or phylogenetically related viruses to henipaviruses, ebolaviruses and rabies virus have been detected in Chinese fruit bats (He et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2010; Li et al. 2008; Yang et al. 2017; Yuan et al. 2012 ).

HKU9 includes more variants and are genetically diverse, while GCCDC1 is less diverse. The greatest difference between these two viral species is the presence of p10 gene, which is thought to have been obtained from a reovirus, in the GCCDC1 genome (Huang et al. 2016; Lau et al. 2010) . In Yunnan province, there are at least three fruit bat species, Eonycteris spelaea, R. leschenaultia, and an unclassified Rousettus species (He et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2017) .

Highly diverse HKU9related CoVs were found in Rousettus bats, while GCCDC1-related viruses found in E. spelaea showed high similarity. For HKU9-related CoVs, in addition to four (Lau et al. 2010 ), a novel lineage was identified in this study. Previous studies reported that all group 2d coronaviruses within the betacoronavirus were from R. leschenaulti. In this study, we identified all bat species positive for coronavirus by sequencing the Cytb gene and found that HKU9 and GCCDC1 were from two different genera, Rousettus and Eonycteris, respectively. HKU9 consists 5 lineages. Lineage 1 and 2 are from R. leschenaulti and Lineages 3-5 are from an unidentified species Rousetta sp. These results suggest that the coronaviruses may undergo host restriction and have a long evolution history with their hosts. We amplified multiple N genes and obtained the fulllength genomic sequence of a novel HKU9 of linage 5 (BatCoV HKU9-2202). The most notable sequence difference between this novel HKU9 and previously identified BatCoV HKU9s is within the S gene. The S protein of HKU9-2202 shares 61%-68% aa identity to those of previously identified HKU9. The S protein plays a pivotal role in mediating coronavirus entry into host cells. Whether mutations in S are responsible for virulence and tissue tropism of HKU9-2202 requires further analysis.",

These fruit bats feed on fruits and flowers and have frequent contact with peoples and farms, thus increasing the risk of spillover of bat viruses to domestic animals and humans. In our previous study, we also found that these bats harbor novel genetically diverse filoviruses, some of which were found to coinfect with BatCoV HKU9 or GCCDC1 in the same individual (Huang et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2017) . Our results improve the understanding of variable viruses carried by fruit bats in China. Further studies are needed to investigate the virome of these bat populations and understand the spillover potential of these bat viruses to other animals and humans.",
