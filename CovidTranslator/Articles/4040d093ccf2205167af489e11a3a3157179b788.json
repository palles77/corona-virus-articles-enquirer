            "text": "On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated an outbreak of a novel coronavirus not seen before in humans to be a \"public health emergency of international concern\" (PHEIC); this was followed by the declaration of a pandemic on . 1,2 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously referred to as 2019-nCoV, is the virus responsible for causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) . [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The pandemic traces its early beginnings to the report of a cluster of 27 unexplained pneumonia cases in late December 2019 originating from a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. [8] [9] [10] [11] From the outset, the causative agent was thought to be viral, with most patients reporting fever or dyspnea. 9, 11 With unprecedented numbers of individuals under travel restrictions or quarantine, worldwide spread, and no known cure or vaccine yet available, COVID-19 has proven a formidable adversary. 12, [13] [14] [15] J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2020, the greatest number of new cases are now being reported in Italy, Spain, Germany, and the United States (U.S.) (Figures 3 and 4) . [24] [25] [26] Based on what is known about other coronaviruses, experts believe COVID-19 primarily spreads from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 feet) by respiratory droplets. 4, 8, 14, 23, 27 Transmission of the virus through contaminated surfaces or fomites with subsequent contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth may also occur. 14, 23, 27 Patients are felt to be at highest risk of spreading the illness when they are most symptomatic. 23, 27 Limited data support viral shedding in asymptomatic patients while increased levels of viral shedding may be more pronounced in those critically ill. [28] [29] [30] Current epidemiologic patterns of COVID- 19 in China indicate that it is highly contagious with sustained spread; the extent of person-to-person transmission within the U.S. was initially limited and continues to evolve daily. 23 The current R 0 or basic reproduction number is estimated to be greater than 2.2; for every case of identified in the population, more than 2 additional cases are possible in the absence of adequate isolation. 20, [31] [32] [33] In an early epidemiologic analysis of 425 COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, the median patient age was 59 years, and 56% were male. 20 In the largest study to date of COVID-19, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f comprising over 72,000 patient records (up to from China, 86.6% of patients were 30-79 years of age. 34 While 80.9% of these cases were reported to be mild, the overall case fatality rate was 2.3%. 34 Few pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported, with patients aged 0-19 years representing just 2.1% of all cases. 34, 35 Approximately 3.8% of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 occurred in healthcare personnel, and 14.6% of these cases were either severe or critical. 34 To be classified as severe, the following characteristics were required: PaO2/FiO2 <300, oxygen saturation \u226493%, presence of >50% lung infiltrates within 24-48 hours, respirations \u2265 30 breaths/minute, or dyspnea. 34 Critical patients, defined as those with septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction/failure, and/or respiratory failure, accounted for approximately 5% of the study population with a case fatality rate of 49.0%. 34, 24 The highest case fatality rate was observed in those older than 80 years (14.8%). 34 Patients without comorbidities had a case fatality rate of just 0.9%, in contrast to those with comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease (10.5%). 34 Caution should be exercised in interpreting early findings, as underreporting and variable testing practices have been a concern with COVID-19. 36, 37 Case fatality rates in Hubei Province have been reported to be 18% (95% confidence interval [CI] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , while those outside mainland China range from 1.2-5.1%. 38 Mortality rates have been calculated to be as high as 11-15%. 39, 40 When compared to other recent epidemics such as SARS (9.56) or EVD (39.53), the average case fatality rate (4.2%) for COVID-19 is much lower (Table   1) . 41, 42 In comparison, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and 2017 influenza season were responsible for approximately 220 times more cases. 41, 42 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Based on what is known about similar coronaviruses, the longest potential incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be 14 days from initial exposure. 4, 6 The mean incubation period is 5.2 days (95% CI 4.1-7.0) but can range from 2 to 14 days. 4, 20, 43 Coinfections occur in 22-33% of patients and may be higher in critical patients. 44, 45 ",

Completing a thorough yet focused history and physical examination and obtaining collateral history from family members are vital. Aside from pulmonary symptoms, patients with COVID-19 may initially present with more vague complaints including diarrhea, lethargy, myalgias, and nausea. 40, 57 Patients may also experience headache, confusion, vomiting, pleurisy, sore throat, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. 40, 58 A case series of 41 patients (median age 49.0 years) with COVID-19 from Wuhan, China found the most commonly reported symptoms were cough (76%), fever (98%), or dyspnea (55%). 39 In the same case series, patients also reported myalgias/fatigue (44%), productive cough (28%), headache (8%), hemoptysis (5%), and diarrhea (3%). 39 In a nationwide study of COVID-19 cases from across China, the most common presenting symptoms included cough (68%), fever (44%), fatigue (38%), J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f sputum production (34%), and shortness of breath (19%). 59 Fever was not a predominant symptom at the time of initial presentation. In patients with more severe disease, dyspnea may be present in 37% of patients and progress to acute lung injury in 15% of patients. 60 One study of 204 patients with confirmed COVID-19 suggests 48.5% of patients have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. 61 These symptoms may include anorexia (83.8%), diarrhea (29.3%), vomiting (0.8%), and abdominal pain (0.4%). Seven of the 204 patients had only GI symptoms with no respiratory symptoms. 61 Atypical presentations of infection in general may be more likely in the elderly and immunocompromised, who may not mount a febrile response. 62, 63 To increase sensitivity and identify potential COVID-19 patients sooner, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using a temperature cutoff of 100.0 F o . 64 Patients older than 60 years of age and those with comorbidities may also present with more severe disease compared to other populations. 58 Three major trajectories for COVID-19 have been described: mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) necessitating aggressive resuscitative measures. 65 Anywhere from 17-29% of patients may develop ARDS. 39, 40 Other complications of COVID-19 include secondary bacterial infection, acute kidney injury, septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and cardiac injury. 39, 40 Initial Approach to COVID-19 in the Emergency Department (Table 2 ). Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have had a subjective or confirmed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). 66 In concert with clinician judgment regarding patient presentations compatible with COVID-19, CDC guidelines prioritize patients from defined populations for further evaluation and testing as persons under investigation (PUI) ( Table 3 ). These criteria are not exhaustive, and patients with an unestablished etiology or equivocal history of exposure may be considered for further testing on an individual basis. 67 Confirmed local COVID-19 cases in the setting of known community transmission should reduce the threshold for further COVID-19 evaluation in the ED. Collaboration with local and state public health departments is strongly recommended. 62,67 A PUI should be asked to wear a facemask to reduce risk of transmission to others in the immediate vicinity.

Ideally, transport vehicles with isolated compartments or high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration should be used and if coordinated with the receiving healthcare facility, transportation of the patient directly into an isolation room. 68 After the patient has been transported and EMS documentation is being completed, patient compartment doors should be left open to allow proper ventilation. 68 When cleaning the vehicle, disposable gown, gloves, surgical mask, and face shield should be worn. 68 Routine cleaning should be followed by application of a hospital- Personnel cleaning empty PUI rooms should follow droplet, contact, and standard precautions with eye protection as infectious particles may be present. 63 It is unclear how long SARS-CoV-2 remains in the air, but drawing parallels from other airborne disease such as tuberculosis can be helpful, particularly if an aerosol-generating procedure has been performed. 63 Frequently used surfaces should be cleaned at least twice daily with implementation of standard institutional cleaning procedures. 71",

Instead, impermeable shoes that can be appropriately decontaminated should be worn. 30 If available, coveralls with or without a hood may be used, but processes and training in safe doffing should be established beforehand as HCPs may be less experienced in using these PPE ensembles. 30 HCPs may consider double gloving and positioning waste and other transport receptacles close by to limit droplet and/or contact transmission when securing contaminated equipment for disposal or reprocessing. 72 Preoxygenation should be optimized with nonaerosol generating strategies including head of bed elevation, jaw thrust, and use of positive end expiratory pressure valves. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy should be avoided unless absolutely necessary as atomization of anesthetic will cause the virus to become aerosolized. 72 Similarly, to minimize potential aerosolization from manual ventilation, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f preoxygenation for at least 5 minutes with 100% oxygen before performing rapid sequence intubation (RSI) may be used with nasal cannula, though this may increase the risk of contamination. 30, 72 To reduce this risk, a surgical mask can be placed on the patient over the device. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may increase risk of aerosolization and is not recommended for preoxygenation. 30, 72 A high efficiency hydrophobic filter should be used between the facemask and the rest of the respiratory circuit. 72 Video laryngoscopy is preferred to direct laryngoscopy to increase distance between the intubator and the patient. 30 ,70 A closed system should be utilized for suctioning. Once the intubation is complete, the emergency physician should immediately place the laryngoscope in their outer glove along with all other equipment used for intubation in a double zip-locked plastic bag. 72 The presence of a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter should be verified in the expiratory limb of the mechanical ventilator prior to patient use.",

World Health Organization (WHO) Case and Contact Definitions for global surveillance of COVID-19. https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillancefor-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov) Suspected case A. A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset; OR B. A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset; OR C. A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that fully explains the clinical presentation. Probable case A. A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive. OR B. A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason. See laboratory guidance for details: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019/technicalguidance/laboratory-guidance Contact A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case: \uf0b7 Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes; \uf0b7 Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case; \uf0b7 Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal protective equipment; OR \uf0b7 Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments. Note: For confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.",

COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that has affected an unprecedented number of people to date. Patients typically present with a combination of fever or cough and have a history of exposure to either a close contact with COVID-19 or travel to an affected geographic area. While most patients will have mild disease, some may develop severe complications including ARDS and multi-organ failure, with some succumbing to the disease. Special consideration should be given to those at the extremes of age, the immunocompromised, or pregnant women. No curative treatment is currently approved. Emergency physicians should obtain a detailed travel history from all patients and suspect COVID-19 in patients presenting with symptoms of an acute upper respiratory illness and fever. Early recognition and isolation of a patient with COVID-19 in the ED may help decrease exposure to other patients and healthcare personnel. Future research is necessary to expand our collective knowledge of COVID-19 and optimize patient outcomes. 5. References 1. World Health Organization.
