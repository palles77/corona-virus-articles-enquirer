These differences probably stem from sex-related abilities to mount proper or unwanted immune responses against an infectious agent. We report that hantavirus-infected female patients show significantly higher plasma levels of interleukin-9 (IL-9), fibroblast growth factor 2, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and lower levels of IL-8 and gamma interferon-induced protein 10 than male patients. The results demonstrate that a virus infection can induce sex-dependent differences in acute immune responses in humans. This finding may, at least partly, explain the observed sex differences in susceptibility to infectious diseases and in mortality following infection.",

In contrast, autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in females (17) . It is believed that these differences stem from sex-related abilities to mount proper or unwanted immune responses. One important sex difference might be the cytokine response evoked during infection. Elevated levels of certain cytokines have been observed in many infectious diseases and are the cause of the typical flu-like symptoms that often appear during virus infections (3, 4, 9) . Cytokines are mediators of information that play very important roles in shaping and maintaining the immune responses. In particular, the response against virus infections relies on the early production of cytokines that induce an antiviral state and trigger the activation of immune cells. However, reports on possible sex differences in acute cytokine responses during virus infections in humans are lacking.",

We therefore investigated plasma samples from Puumala hantavirus (PUUV)-infected individuals, as this virus causes an acute disease with transient viremia. Samples from the same individuals drawn after recovery were also analyzed to investigate possible normal sex differences in levels of cytokines. Hantaviruses are transmitted from their natural hosts, rodents, to humans via inhalation of virus-contaminated excreta. In humans, the infection causes two severe diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Amer-icas, with mortality rates of up to 40% depending on the specific hantavirus strain (13, 16) . PUUV causes a mild form of HFRS that is characterized by influenzalike symptoms, followed by renal impairment and, in rare cases, hemorrhage and death (14, 16) .",

No sex differences were observed for any of the 27 investigated cytokines (P values ranging from 0.19 to 0.94; Mann-Whitney U test) during the convalescent phase ( Table 2) , showing that the observed differences during the acute phase are not due to general differences in cytokine levels between females and males. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of sex differences in cytokine responses in patients during an acute virus infection. It has previously been shown that the levels of plasma IL-7 are higher in females than males during chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection (11) . In line with our results, Klein and coworkers have shown that there are sex differences in responses to Seoul hantavirus in Norway rats, the natural host for Seoul hantavirus. Interestingly, they observed similar infectivity rates but differences in immune responses in male and female rats (5-8), clearly showing that there are sex differences in the immunological responses to hantaviruses in natural hosts.",

Whether sex hormones are involved in shaping the observed differences in cytokine profiles and whether other mechanisms are involved are interesting questions that remain to be studied. Intriguingly, although as many females as males in the general population have antibodies against PUUV (1), the maleto-female ratio for diagnosed PUUV infections in Europe ranges from 2:1 to 5:1 (12, 16) , suggesting that males are more likely than females to develop clinical HFRS upon PUUV infection. It is believed that only approximately one out of every eight human PUUV infections is diagnosed, implying that most infections are asymptomatic or only cause mild disease (1). The initial cytokine response evoked early upon PUUV infection most probably will have profound effects on the subsequent activation of immune cells and on their antiviral function, thereby playing an important role in possible progression to disease.",
