Despite widespread vaccination, the prevalence of FCV remains high. Furthermore, a high gene mutation rate has led to the emergence of variants, and some infections are lethal. To date, there is no effective antiviral drug available for treating FCV infection. Here, we show that lithium chloride (LiCl) effectively suppresses the replication of FCV strain F9 in Crandell-Reese feline kidney (CRFK) cells. The antiviral activity of LiCl occurred primarily during the early stage of infection and in a dose-dependent manner. LiCl treatment also inhibited the cytopathic effect. LiCl treatment exhibited a strong inhibitory effect against a panel of other two reference strains and two recent FCV isolates from China. These results demonstrate that LiCl might be an effective anti-FCV drug for controlling FCV disease. Further studies are required to explore the antiviral activity of LiCl against FCV replication in vivo.",

The genus Vesivirus includes feline calicivirus, a highly contagious pathogen with a widespread distribution in the feline population. Oral ulcers, upper respiratory symptoms and high fever are the main clinical signs in FCV-infected kittens, followed by subclinical syndrome, including chronic stomatitis, pneumonitis and limping syndrome. Cats with 'virulent systemic FCV disease' variably show pyrexia, cutaneous edema, ulcerative lesions on the head and limbs, and jaundice. The disease is more severe in adult cats, with higher mortality [7, 25] . In addition, persistent infections lead to a high prevalence of FCV, ranging from approximately 10 % in the general cat population to as much as 90 % in some colonies [24, 36] . Therefore, treating and preventing FCV infection is challenging.",

Indeed, evolutionary rates of the variable regions of the capsid protein have been estimated to be up to 1.3 9 10 -2 to 2.6 9 10 -2 substitutions per nucleotide per year [8] . Accordingly, older vaccines cannot provide crossprotection against newer strains [22, 23] . In addition, the genetic and antigenic landscape is highly complex in each geographical location; thus, vaccine application must be based on an assessment of the situation at both the local and national level [9] . FCV vaccines are generally effective at reducing the severity and duration of clinical signs but do not prevent infection or shedding [24] . Given the insufficiency of FCV vaccines, it is necessary to develop a safe and effective antiviral drug as a monotherapy or combination treatment. In addition to its significance for feline health, FCV is frequently used as a model for human noroviruses, an important cause of vomiting and diarrhea in people [32, 33] .",

Mefloquine was employed as monotherapy or combination treatment with rFeIFN-x [20] , but deficiencies in a number of drug metabolism pathways have been recognized in humans [20] . For more than fifty years, lithium chloride (LiCl) has been used as a major treatment for bipolar disorder [18] , and the mechanisms of LiCl have been explored, particularly for treating Alzheimer's disease [10] , diabetes [16] , and serous ovarian cancer [21] , and also as an antimicrobial agent. Studies have demonstrated that LiCl can inhibit the replication of some viruses, such as herpes simplex virus 1 [29] , coronavirus [27] , infectious bronchitis virus [17] , and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) [11] , and it can suppress inflammatory responses [11] , modulate cell apoptosis [27] , and restore host protein synthesis in infected cells [35] . However, it remains unknown whether LiCl can inhibit FCV replication. In this study, the antiviral activity of LiCl on FCV was investigated in vitro, and we found that LiCl inhibited FCV replication in a dose-dependent manner.",

The virus titers in the cell supernatants were analyzed at 12 h postinfection. The results showed that LiCl strongly inhibited the replication of the reference strains FCV F9, Bolin, and 2280 and field isolates WZ-1 and HRB-SS (Fig. 6) . Compared with mock treatment, LiCl pre-treatment led to a nearly tenfold decrease for the infectivity of field isolates WZ-1 and HRB-SS (Fig. 6) . These results demonstrated that LiCl could inhibit the growth of both reference strains and field isolates in vitro.",

The inhibitory effect of LiCl occurred primarily in the early stages and was dose dependent. LiCl treatment also reduced the FCV-induced cytopathic effect.

These results are consistent with the inhibitory effect of LiCl on other viruses such as HSV-1, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, and infectious bronchitis virus and indicate that the antiviral effect of LiCl may be a general feature of this drug on certain viruses, e.g., coronaviruses [12] . Although the frequency of FCV gene mutation is high, all FCV strains belong to the same serotype. In addition, F9 as well as another seven FCV strains show the same sensitivity to the antiviral drug mefloquine [20] . While the antiviral efficiency varied for different FCV strains infection, LiCl could function in the currently circulating viruses in China.",

In addition, when the concentration of LiCl was increased from 10 mM to 100 mM, the viability of CRFK cells decreased by less than 20 % at 24 h post-inoculation. However, the viability decreased to under 50 % at 72 h post-inoculation. F9 and other FCV strains replicate and spread rapidly. FCV-induced CPE on CRFK cells is obvious at 12 h postinfection at an MOI of 0.1, with nearly all cells becoming rounded and sloughing at 24 h postinfection. Thus, it is reasonable to use a high dose of LiCl to evaluate its antiviral effects against FCV replication in vitro, but high concentrations of LiCl in blood can cause side or toxic effects [34] . Symptoms associated with it are generally mild, including tremor, nausea, diarrhea, vertigo, and confusion [14] . However, higher lithium levels in the h.

LiCl regulates multiple biological processes [34] and is considered to be a nonspecific inhibitor of GSK3b. LiCl has been shown to effectively suppress EV-A71 replication, apoptosis, and inflammatory cytokine production (interleukin 6, interleukin-1b) in infected cells [15] . However, LiCl attenuates LPS-, poly(I:C)-and Sendai-virus-induced IFN-b production in a GSK3b-independent manner in macrophages [34] , which appears to be contradictory with regard to the antiviral effects of LiCl. LiCl is widely used as a long-term mood stabilizer in the treatment of psychiatric diseases due to its inhibition of GSK3b, a multifunctional kinase involved in cellular processes, including glycogen metabolism, cell proliferation, neuronal function, oncogenesis, and development [5, 6] , and recent studies have provided evidence for the involvement of GSK3b in innate immune responses [1] . GSK3b is also a crucial regulator of the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokine production in both the peripheral and central nervous system and influences T-cell proliferation, differentiation and survival [1] . LiCl is not only a specific inhibitor of enzymes belonging to the GSK family but also of pyruvate kinase, polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, and inositol monophosphate [6, 13] . The precise mechanism of the antiviral effect of LiCl needs to be investigated further.",
