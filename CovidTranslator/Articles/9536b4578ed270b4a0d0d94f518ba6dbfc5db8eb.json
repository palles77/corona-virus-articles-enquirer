The purpose (at least one major purpose) of the vector (mosquito) population is to keep tracking the mosquito density. However, we found a mosquito index (i.e., the ovitrap index) from observation. Thus we directly use this mosquito index as the replacement of the vector (i.e., mosquito in this work) population.This approach saved us from explicitly modeling the mosquito population. Alternatively, we could have formulate a two-host model with both pig and mosquito. Then we aim to fit simultaneously the observed human cases and the observed mosquito index. That will be a challenging future work.S2.3 R 0 and CCS after New JEV InvasionNew R 0 and CCS before/after the invasion of the new JEV strain It is hard to directly estimate the R 0 with the simplified model (as we avoid model the mosquito and human population explicitly), but we can estimate the percentage change on R 0 before/after new strain invasion. As we wrote in paragraph \"Force of Infection from Vectors to Reservoirs\" (from mosquito to pig) in \"Parameter Estimation\" section, \u03bb vp can be further expressed as 80 \u03bb vp = a\u03b8 vp I v /N p . Then, the model is similar to the ODE system proposed in Gao et al.[1]  by regarding pigs as \"host\" and mosquito as vector.
