Notwithstanding the likelihood that many management practices that are currently used in cattle production (such as vaccination on arrival to feedlots) do not provide the necessary or optimal conditions for the development of protective immune responses,61 a better understanding of the role of the immune response in the pathogenesis and prophylaxis of BRDC will likely aid in better control of the syndrome. Moreover, the increasing concerns over the use of antibiotics in livestock and the perceptions and possible negative implications of animal agriculturerelated antimicrobial resistance for human medicine indicate that manipulation of the bovine immune system may become increasingly important in disease management in the future. Therefore, these concerns dictate that a better understanding of the ruminant immune system in health and disease is likely to become more of a priority and the focus of continuing research. This article concerning the role of the immune system in pathogenic and disease-sparing roles in the BRDC focuses on recent advances in our knowledge since the previous issue of the Veterinary Clinics of North America: Food Animal Practice that dealt with respiratory disease in cattle.",

            "text": "The respiratory tract is a mucosal surface that is different from other body surfaces where infectious agents interact with the host and diseases may occur. Because of the requirement for unimpeded access of air to the alveoli and the resultant close contact between the external and internal environments that is required for gaseous exchange to occur, this mucosal surface has evolved a filtering system that is capable of removing particles as small as 5 J.Lm before they reach the alveoli. The gross structural basis for this filtering system is the confirmation of the turbinates, trachea, and bronchi, and the turbulence created by movement of air within these structures. Microscopic features of this filtering system comprise cilia that move particulate debris toward the external nares. The mucosal lining of the respiratory tract is coated by mucous that contains antimicrobial soluble factors, such as lysozyme and immunoglobulin A, and it performs trapping and antiseptic functions. 60 The role of viral agents in altering or destroying the structural integrity of the filtering system, such as cilia and lining epithelial cells, is well established. 8, 35 The importance of the nonspecific phagocytic and digestive functions of resident and infiltrating bronchoalveolar macrophages (BAM) and neutrophils and the effect of various viruses and bacterial virulence factors on these functions are well recognized. 3s , 48, 60 Recent studies have better addressed how various host and pathogen factors interact at the molecular level to alter the efficacy of the scavenging features of the phagocytes.",

I5 , 16 In contrast, in calves with experimental bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infections in which neutrophil infiltration of the airways and parenchyma is not as prominent as in M. haemolytica-associated pneumonias, IL-8 expression was reduced, Studies in calves with bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency that congenitally lack CD18 expression have demonstrated that this adhesion molecule is essential for the initial passage of neutrophils through the extensive extracellular matrix of the pulmonary airways.! In addition, the expression of the adhesion molecule intracellular adhesion molecule-Ion bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium, arterial and venous endothelium, and on BAM and neutrophils is upregulated in calves experimentally infected with M. haemolytica, compared with saline-inoculated controls. 52 These results are compatible with the hypothesis that this molecule also plays an important role in leukocyte infiltration, and thereby is important in the pathogenesis of inflammation and tissue damage in the lung. Relatedly, recent investigations document that in addition to controlling the growth of M. haemolytica, tilmicosin, a commonly used antibiotic, may reduce pulmonary inflammation by inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) of neutrophils and reducing leukotriene B4 secretionY Apoptotic neutrophils do not lyse and release tissue-damaging proteolytic enzymes, so further amplification of inflammatory injury in M. haemolytica-infected lungs is prevented. These changes occurred without effects on neutrophil infiltration or function.",

Despite some recent results demonstrating the positive effect of orally administered human recombinant interferon alpha on weight gain in feedlot cattle with BROC,2\u00b0 the almost complete failure of the application of recombinant bovine cytokines (such as IL-2) as therapeutic or preventive agents in cattle attests to the difficulty of this reductionist approach. Another related complicating factor in the application of molecularly targeted therapies in cattle is the difficulty in accurately assessing the stage of disease in individual animals. Continuing work aimed at the possibility of more practically measuring acute-phase proteins may provide a better means of identifying candidates for therapy. Acute-phase proteins such as serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, and alpha I-acid glycoprotein are produced in the liver in response to proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-I and tumor necrosis factor-a.. 55 Recently, serum concentrations of serum amyloid A and haptoglobin were used to discriminate between acute and chronic inflammatory conditions in cattle. 33 The practical application of such testing methods almost certainly depends on the development of cow-side tests so that intervention decisions can be made at the time cattle are processed.",

            "text": "It has been proposed recently that specific antibodies to M. haemolytica and immune complexes that result from the interaction between the bacteria and antibodies in the lung may be a component of the pathogenesis of BROC. 44 In a retrospective immunohistologic examination of lung tissue from 44 cases of naturally acquired bovine pneumonic mannheimeosis, immune complexes were observed in alveolar spaces and walls in 88% of the animals. To further study this potential immunopathologic effect prospectively, mice were immunized with purified outer membrane proteins (OMPs) from M. haemolytica and subsequently challenged intratracheally with the live bacteria or OMPs. Immunized mice developed high serum immunoglobulin G responses to the OMPs and necrotizing bronchointerstitial pneumonic lesions. Similar to the findings in the cases of BRDC, immune complexes and complement were identified in alveolar walls in damaged pulmonary tissue. Based on these findings, it was proposed that immune complex disease might be a component of the pathogenesis of BRDC associated with Mannheimia infections. This is logical from an immunologic standpoint, based on the nature of the inflammatory lesions in which complement fixation could mediate neutrophil infiltration and the likely possibility that specific antibodies to M. haemolytica could result from previous natural exposure or vaccination and could be present in many cattle that develop pneumonic mannheimiosis. These results may explain previous observations that the administration of early, crude Mannheimia vaccines was associated with disease enhancement in cattle that subsequently developed Mannheimia-associated BRDC. These findings support the concept that better defined or subunit Mannheimia vaccines that apparently do not contain the offending bacterial components are associated with improved efficacy and fewer adverse reactions. 48 Several species of mycoplasma have been recognized as etiologic agents in calf pneumonia. s , 48 There is increasing evidence that Mycoplasma bovis is an emergent, or at least better recognized, respiratory pathogen in older (feedlot) cattle in North America and elsewhere. 26 ,38 Several factors could contribute to this apparent emergence: better control of other bacterial pathogens through the use of vaccines and antibiotics, or interaction with other pathogens such as bovine viral diarrhea virus,26 both of which could allow M. bovis to better assume a role as an opportunistic pathogen; increased virulence of M. bovis; or as-yetunidentified host or management factors. Studies conducted in the 1980s suggest that the immune response to M. bovis may be contributory to lesion development. 29, 31 Based largely on the prominence of immunoglobulin G1 and, to a lesser extent, immunoglobulin G2-containing cells at the periphery of characteristic, necrotizing M. bovis-associated lesions, it was proposed that a specific immunoglobulin, rather than a cellmediated immune response, is at least partly responsible for the lesions seen in calves infected with M. bovis, although its specific role was not further identified. 29 ,31 In contrast to murine mycoplasmosis caused by M. pulmonis and M. pneumoniae that colonize the epithelium of small airways and cause hyperplasia of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), M. bovis is invasive, and hyperplasia of BALT is not a prominent feature of the pulmonary lesion in cattle. 29 ,31 Consistent with this is the lack of mitogenic activity of at least some strains of M. bovis for cultured bovine lymphocytes, indicating that any lymphoid involvement in the lesions is not caused by a nonspecific mitogenic effect. 29",

Traditionally, identification of protective immune responses has been approached in the context of vaccine trials, in which protection or disease sparing is correlated with various immune responses, usually in the context of experimental infections. Correlation of reduction of naturally acquired disease with immune responses, primarily serologic, is a more epidemiologic, if also less than perfect, approach to this problem. Recent studies have continued to use both approaches to better understand the immune response in BRDC and are reviewed in a pathogen-specific manner.",

To date, there are no published prospective studies that address protective immunologic mechanisms in BCV infections in the respiratory tract. There are no data indicating that any of the commercially available vaccines containing either modified live or inactivated BCV have been applied in the prophylaxis of BRDC. Although discussion of protective immunologic mechanisms would be largely speculative at this point, there is some evidence, similar to the case with BCV-associated enteric disease,35 that maternal antibodies have a disease-sparing effect on BCV-associated respiratory disease in young calves (John A. Ellis, DVM, PhD, unpublished data, 2000). Seroconversion has been associated recently with a reduced risk of BCV shedding in feedlot calves. 39 Given the genetic and antigenic relatedness of the BCV isolates causing enteric and respiratory disease2 7 , 35 and, consistent with the quasispecific nature of BCV, it is likely that neonatal enteric infections with BCV can induce mucosal and systemic antibodies that reduce respiratory disease resulting from subsequent respiratory BCV infectionsy,35",

In the case of primary BRSV infection in susceptible, naive cattle, several lines of evidence indicate the local cell-mediated immunity is the critical protective immunologic mechanism in animals that recover from infection, as has been previously hypothesized. s Demonstration of genetically restricted cell-mediated cytotoxicity by cells in pulmonary lavage fluid 62 and phenotypic analyses using monoclonal antibodies 46 indicates that CD8 + T lymphocytes are the primary cells mediating a disease-sparing response. This response by CD8 + T cells has been shown to occur in the absence of significant local or systemic antibody responses. 62 In the case of cattle that have been primed immunologically to respond to BRSV by vaccination with modified live vaccines and probably by naturally acquired infections or exposure, both antibody and cell-mediated responses were associated with disease sparing. 62 Viral clearance and clinical protection was coincident with the simultaneous appearance of mucosal antibody (immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G), cytotoxic cells in the lung, and primary or anamnestic serum antibody responses to the virus. Interestingly, parenteral vaccination primed for anamnestic mucosal antibody responses. 62 Vaccine-associated secretion of interferon-'Y by peripheral blood leukocytes, assumedly by CD4 + T cells, was a further correlate of protection in vaccinated calves 62 and can be detected in the lung along with other cytokines in naive cattle. 45 The antigen specificity of these antibody responses associated with protection was not determined, but results of other studies 55 continue to support the conceptB that neutralizing antibody responses to epitopes on the fusion (F) protein of the virus are protective and that responses to epitopes on the F protein may differ in vaccinated and infected cattle. It has been shown recently that responses to specific epitopes on the F but not the G protein in infected cattle may be related to bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA) haplotypes,55 which may relate to differences in disease severity among BRSV-infected cattle.",

Studies completed and published in the United Kingdom in the 1980s documented the efficacy of combination vaccines containing M. bovis in reducing respiratory disease that was associated with M. bovis infection alone or together with BRSV.30 Detailed immunologic studies indicated that protection from M. bovis infection is dependent on killing of the pathogen through antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity.28, 29, 31 Purified M. bovis-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and IgG2 promoted killing by macrophages, whereas IgG2 promoted killing by neutrophils. M. bovis-specific IgM was ineffective in promoting cellular cytotoxicity by either phagocyte, and incubation of M. bovis with specific IgG1, IgG2, or IgM alone had no effect on the viability of the organism. In experimentally infected calves, IgA-containing cells, lymphocytes, and plasma cells were present in the submucosa of tissues from the nasal cavity and trachea, and M. bovis-specific IgA was present in tracheobronchial washings and sera. IgA-containing cells, however, were not a prominent infiltrating cell in lesions, and the role of this immunoglobulin isotype in killing of M. bovis was not documented. There have been no recent published studies examining the mechanisms of protection or pathogenesis in M. bovis infection in cattle; however, some recent studies have focused on a better definition of potential molecular vaccine candidates for M. bovis,54 but the antigen specificity of the bovine immune responses to M. bovis and their role in protection and pathogenesis are currently poorly understood.",
