The cats were grouped into seven categories based upon the diagnosis suggested by results of MRI, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and other diagnostic procedures: neoplastic (n \u00bc 25), inflammatory or infectious (n \u00bc 13), traumatic (n \u00bc 8), vascular (n \u00bc 6), degenerative (n \u00bc 5), anomalous (n \u00bc 3) and those with an unremarkable MRI (n \u00bc 32). There were two independent predictors of abnormal MRI findings: severity of clinical signs and presence of spinal pain. Abnormal MRI findings and speed of onset of disease were significantly associated with survival. For the 32 cats with unremarkable MRI findings, only nine died due to spinal disease and, therefore, the median survival time (MST) was not reached (lower 95% confidence interval (CI) \u00bc 970 days). For the 60 cats with abnormal MRI findings, 37 died due to their disease and the MST was 138 days (95% CI: 7e807).",

Several studies and case reports of specific disease processes that affect the spinal cord of cats have been published, including those on spinal lymphoma, 1e3 intervertebral disc disease, 4e8 and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). 9e11 A large retrospective survey of neurological disease in cats using archived central nervous tissue 12 and a retrospective study of the frequency of spinal cord disease identified on post-mortem examination 13 exist, but the authors are not aware of any antemortem studies on the relative frequency of the different aetiologies responsible for feline spinal cord disease. Such a study is important in order that a more accurate frequency of devastating diseases such as spinal cord lymphoma can be ascertained and not misrepresented as the authors currently believe is the case.",

            "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine and spinal cord has contributed substantially to the detection and characterisation of spinal diseases. MRI is the method of choice for imaging the spinal cord in human patients being a non-invasive tool that allows examination of the intervertebral discs, foraminae, nerve roots, extradural space and internal architecture of the cord. 14 To the authors' knowledge, there are no studies on the frequency of abnormal spinal MRI findings in cats. It is the authors' clinical opinion that MRI investigation of cats with clinical signs of spinal disease can frequently be normal, limiting the therapeutic and prognostic information which can be given to the owners. It is important that an attempt to quantify the frequency of 'normal' MRI studies in cats with clinical spinal cord disease be made, so that practitioners and owners alike are aware that it is a contributory diagnostic test rather than an absolute test. Information about the outcome of such cats may be clinically valuable and has not previously been investigated. Additionally, improving the diagnostic yield of MRI may be possible if risk factors for MRI abnormalities can be identified, important when diagnostic decision making is tempered by owner finances.",

Dorsal and sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and T1-weighted post-contrast (gadobenate dimeglumine 0.05 mmol/ kg) sequences were obtained; transverse images were obtained where considered appropriate by the operating radiologist. A board-certified veterinary radiologist reviewed all the images, recording the following MRI characteristics: spinal cord segment(s) affected, lesion characteristics, effects of the lesion on the cord and presence of osteolysis. The lesions identified on MRI were described according to their location relative to the spine and spinal cord parenchyma (paraspinal, extradural, intradural extramedullary or intramedullary) and to its effects on the spinal cord (compression, swelling and MRI signal alteration). According to the MRI findings, the spinal cord was subdivided into five vertebral segments for neurolocalisation: C1eC5, C6eT2, T3eL3, L4eL6 and L7eS3. The MRI findings together with the history, clinical signs, neurological evaluation and results from other diagnostic tests (CSF analysis, radiography, serology, cytology, histopathology, electrodiagnostic studies, surgical findings and post-mortem examination), generated a presumptive diagnosis. In view of these diagnoses, each case was Logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between MRI findings and potential explanatory variables (age, gender, breed, duration of clinical signs, speed of onset of disease, severity of clinical signs, presence of spinal pain on presentation, cranial nerve involvement, CSF analysis, corticosteroid administration prior to referral and whether clinical signs progressed prior to MRI). Variables with P < 0.30 in the univariable analysis were considered for inclusion in multivariable logistic regression. Variables were selected for inclusion in the final model if they significantly improved the fit (likelihood ratio c 2 statistic P < 0.05). Cross-tabulation and a Fisher's exact test were used to examine the association between presence of osteolysis on MRI and the diagnosis of neoplastic disease. Results of logistic regression and cross-tabulation are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). KaplaneMeier survival analysis was performed to estimate median survival time (MST) with 95% CIs. Survival was determined from the date of diagnosis to the censor date of 15 November 2006. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to evaluate the effects of potential explanatory variables on survival. Variables with P < 0.30 in the univariable analysis were considered for inclusion in multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Variables were selected for inclusion in the final model if they significantly improved the fit (likelihood ratio c 2 statistic P < 0.05). Results are presented as hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs. Significance was set at P < 0.05 for all final models. The proportionality assumption was checked for the Cox model and the residuals were examined as an assessment of the fit of the final models to the data.",

This finding is similar to those of the two previous studies that did not involve the use of MRI. 12, 13 There are several pathological processes that may be undetectable on MRI, including inflammatory, vascular or degenerative diseases. This group of cats presents a tremendous diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic challenge. Further information on the cause(s) of spinal disease in this group of cats is evidently required. It is possible that the cats with abnormal CSF analysis, mainly the ones with pleocytosis, had underlying inflammatory diseases that remained undiagnosed. Some of these cats improved with antibiotic therapy, others with corticosteroid therapy, others deteriorated despite different treatment attempts and a last group improved without treatment. This suggests different underlying aetiologies that could not be diagnosed through the routinely available diagnostic procedures. In the cats with normal CSF findings, almost half of these cases (n \u00bc 6) had a history of trauma and most of them recovered without treatment raising the possibility of subtle lesions that could not be visualised on MRI.",

This contrasts with previous studies that found inflammatory disease to be most common. 12, 13 This may be related to geographic differences as both previous studies were performed in the USA, the fact that several of the feline inflammatory diseases can be diagnosed through serum titres and, therefore, these cats do not undergo advanced imaging or that a proportion of the cats with unremarkable MRI and abnormal CSF (n \u00bc 11) had inflammatory diseases that remained unidentified. Lymphoma was the most frequent neoplastic process diagnosed and this agrees with what has been previously reported. 1e3,15 A positive FeLV status has been implicated as the most important factor associated with feline lymphoid tumours. 1, 2 In our study, although all 55 of the cats tested for FeLV were negative, only three of the seven cats diagnosed with lymphoma were tested. Due to this small number, no conclusions can be made about the relationship between FeLV and spinal lymphoma. Nonetheless, it is possible that the widespread use of the FeLV vaccination over the past decade could account for a suspected reduction of FeLV associated lymphoma cases.",

Spinal pain is often caused by extradural compression of the spinal cord (eg, degenerative intervertebral disc disease), vertebral (eg, discospondylitis) or paraspinal lesions (eg, soft tissue abscess). Most of these lesions are easily identifiable on MRI and this may explain why abnormalities were more commonly found in the cats presenting pain.
