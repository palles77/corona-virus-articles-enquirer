In an immunofluorescence assay, these cardenolides were found to diminish the expressions of TGEV nucleocapsid and spike protein, which was used as an indication for viral replication; block TGEV infection induced apoptosis and cytopathic effects; and impart the same trend of inhibitory activity against Na + /K + -ATPase as for anti-TGEV activity. The viral titer inhibition was found to take place in a dose-dependent manner. Knocking down expression of Na + /K + -ATPase, the cellular receptor of cardenolides, in ST cells was found to significantly impair the susceptibility of ST cells to TGEV infectivity. Thus, we have identified Na + /K + -ATPase as an anti-viral drug target and its antagonists, cardenolides, a novel class of anti-TGEV agents.",

These Na + /K + -ATPases are composed of two subunits (\u03b1 and \u03b2) and an auxiliary subunit \u03b3. The \u03b1-subunit binds ATP and both Na + and K + ions as well as allosteric binding for cardenolides. The combination of \u03b1 subunit and \u03b2 subunit have been shown to exhibit different kinetic parameters, including selectivity for cardenolides, and tissue distribution (Baker Bechmann et al., 2016; Habeck et al., 2016; Katz et al., 2015) .",

The ST cells were pretreated with the test compounds for 1 h prior to infection with TGEV at an MOI of 7. After 6 h of TGEV infection, the ST cells were fixed and subjected to IFA with antibodies specific for the S and N proteins of TGEV. Reevesioside A, reevesioside F, and epi-reevesioside F, all possessing structural features similar to those found in the cardenolides, were found to impart potent anti-TGEV activity with IC 50 values of 164 \u00b1 47 nM, 304 \u00b1 44 nM, and 155 \u00b1 39 nM, respectively. Accordingly, more cardenolides were sought so their anti-TGEV activity could be tested. Digoxin, digitoxin, oleandrin, and ouabain amongst others were also found to impart potent anti-TGEV activities with IC 50 values of 615 \u00b1 120, 373 \u00b1 32, 166 \u00b1 8, and 147 \u00b1 28 nM, respectively (Table 1) . Next, we examined the inhibitory activity of these cardenolides against Na + /K + -ATPase and found a correlated trends of inhibition for both TGEV and Na + /K + -ATPase (Table 1 ). The represented structures and dose dependent inhibition curves for IC 50 values from IFA results of these compounds are shown in Fig. 1A , B and C respectively. Moreover, the N protein expression by western analyses in TGEV infected ST cells also exhibited a dose dependent manner of decreases by treatments with oleandrin or reevesioside A (Fig. 1D) . Na + /K + -ATPase \u03b11 protein level was not significantly affected upon TGEV infection in ST cells (Fig. 1E) .

            "text": "Based on above findings, the role of Na + /K + -ATPase in anti-TGEV cardenolides was next examined. We knocked down the Na + /K + -ATPase \u03b11 expression in ST cells by an RNA silencing approach with two distinct ATP1A1-shRNAs (clone ID: TRCN0000332624 and TRCN0000444902) (see Materials and methods) and obtained the stabling expression clones to test for their response to TGEV infection (Fig. 4) . When the Na + /K + -ATPase \u03b11 expression was knocked down to 34 \u00b1 13% and 64 \u00b1 3% respectively, the resultant TGEV infected cells expressed relatively less TGEV N protein, 26 \u00b1 6% and 47 \u00b1 9% Fig. 3 . Effects of cardenolides on reducing TGEV yields. A. Dose dependent effects of reevesioside A and oleandrin on reducing TGEV yields. B. Dose dependent effects of reevesioside A and oleandrin on reducing TGEV N protein expression. ST cells were seeded the day before compound treatment or TGEV infection. The tested compounds were added to the wells 1 h prior to the addition of TGEV (0.01 MOI). The resultant cultures were then incubated for an additional 22 h at 37\u00b0C as indicated. The supernatant of cells in each specific treatment was collected and subjected to viral titers determination via an end-point dilution assay conducted with TGEV infected ST cells, whereas the adherent cells were harvested for western analysis. Results shown were average \u00b1 SD or represented results from three more independent experiments. Fig. 4 . Depletion of Na + /K + -ATPase expression decreased the susceptibility of ST cells to TGEV infectivity. A. Na + /K + -ATPase \u03b11 knock-downed ST cells harboring ATP1A1-shRNA expressed significantly less TGEV N protein when infected by TGEV compared to ST cells harbored control-shRNA. The relative expression levels of Na + /K + -ATPase \u03b11 and TGEV N protein, averages \u00b1 S.D., from three experiments were shown below their respective western blot. B. IFA with antibodies against S and N protein in TGEV (7 MOI) infected ST cells at 6 h.p.i. with control or Na + /K + -ATPase \u03b11 shRNA (ATP1A1-shRNA). C. Quantization of immunofluorescence shown in B. D. Effect of Na + /K + -ATPase activators, aldosterone and Db cAMP, on the Na + /K + -ATPase and TGEV activity in ST cells. Results shown are averages \u00b1 S.D. or represented results from three more independent experiments. The IC 50 values from combined treatments were compared to that of cardenolide treatment alone in TGEV infected ST cells respectively. The Student t-test was used to analyzed the significance with p values for * b0.05 and ** b0.01. (Fig. 4A) . We then measured the relative TGEV N and S expression level by IFA for TGEV infected cells harboring ATP1A1-shRNAs or control-shRNA and used it as an indication of TGEV infectivity (Fig. 4B) . The Na + /K + -ATPase depleted cell clones retained 43 \u00b1 12% and 69 \u00b1 13% of infectivity to TGEV respectively, compared to the control-shRNA cells, which correlated the relative Na + /K + -ATPase expression levels to the corresponding infectivity (Fig. 4C) . Moreover, aldosterone and Db cAMP were reported to increase the Na + /K + -ATPase level and activity (Delamere and King, 1992; Feraille et al., 2003; Gonin et al., 2001; Salyer et al., 2013) therefore we applied them to perform a gain-of-function experiment for Na + /K + -ATPase and TGEV infectivity. We found aldosterone and Db cAMP moderately augmented the Na + / K + -ATPase protein level in ST cells (Fig. 4D-a) and increased the infectivity of TGEV ( Fig. 4D-b) . Furthermore, aldosterone and Db cAMP were able to antagonize anti-TGEV activity of cardenolides (Fig. 4D-c) . Therefore, we concluded that Na + /K + -ATPase contributed to TGEV infectivity in ST cells.",

The murine coronavirus, MHV, is a coronavirus that causes an epidemic murine illness with high mortality, and infects murine cells through the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule-1 (CAE-CAM-1), a cell surface receptor, receptor for attachment and entry (Blau et al., 2001; Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) . TGEV uses and binds membrane aminopeptidase N as its cell receptor for viral entry (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) . The identified anti-TGEV cardenolides did not exert anti-MHV activity in terms of reduction in MHV induced cytopathic effects and viral protein expression (Fig. 5) . Moreover, cardenolides inhibit Na + /K + -ATPase with selectivity over the combination of its \u03b1 (\u03b11-\u03b14) and \u03b2 (\u03b21-\u03b23) isoforms (Baker Bechmann et al., 2016; Habeck et al., 2016; Katz et al., 2015) and cells express different relative levels of \u03b1 subunit which also determines their responsiveness to cardenolides (Yang et al., 2009) . Thus, the combination of Na + /K + -ATPase \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms and the specific cell receptor for each coronavirus are suggested to be important for their selectivity of cardenolides against TGEV over MHV. Moreover, it also merits further exploration of anti-viral activity of cardenolides against other coronaviruses. In addition to above mentioned, whether the Na + /K + -ATPase coupled cellular signaling pathways (Newman et al., 2008) upon the binding to cardenolides contribute to their anti-TGEV activities is also under investigation in our laboratory.",
