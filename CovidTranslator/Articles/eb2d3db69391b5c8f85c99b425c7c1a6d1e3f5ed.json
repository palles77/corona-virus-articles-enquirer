The basic features of immunoglobulins in various species were reviewed in a textbook [2] . Whereas in serology the antibody activity of the immunoglobulins is studied with regards to its specific action with the given antigen, in clinical immunology the ability of the host to produce immunoglobulins (regardless of their antibody specificity) is tested. Immunoglobulins, as any other serum proteins, are known to lead to antibody formation if injected in another species. Consequently, immunoprecipitation is still the most commonly used technique for detection and quantitation of immunoglobulins in the blood serum. The absence of detectable immunoglobulins in colostrum-fed newborn and in adult animals indicates various types of immunodeficiency, usually, but not necessarily, associated with dysfunctions of antibody producing cells of B cell origin. The excess of immunoglobulins indicates either infections or a cancerous disease of immunoglobulin producing cells known as myeloma.",

The optimal procedures for electrophoresis are given by the producers of the equipment used. Commonly sodium-barbital, Tris-barbital, or Tris-tricine buffers, pH 8.6-8.8 are used for serum electrophoresis. We use commercially prepared Tris-barbitalsodium barbital buffer ofpH 8.8 and ionic strength 0.05 with very good results (Fig 2) .

After agitation and 1 hr incubation, the absorbance is read at 660 nm in a spectrophotometer. The absorbance reading is translated to milligrams of gammaglobulins per milliliter, using a standard curve prepared from serum dilutions of known gammaglobulin concentration. The results obtained by this method correspond well with the gammaglobulin concentration in the serum [13] in sera without hemolysis. The effect of hemoglobin coloring in the serum sample on the detected gammaglobulin level can be minimized by using a correction equation [13] :",

            "text": "Rocket immunoelectrophoresis ( Laurell) This relatively new technique was introduced in 1966 by Laurell [22] . It was primarily used to measure strongly negatively charged proteins as is albumin, but may be used for other proteins as well. The method is described in detail in the original Laurell's paper [22] and in a manual [23] . We have used this method for quantitation of immunoglobulins utilizing specific commercially prepared antisera against the given immunoglobulins. In principle, the antigen, e.g. the tested serum (prediluted to 1:10 or 1:20) is placed in constant volumes (5 ~tl) in the wells (2.5 mm diameter) in a layer of agarose containing 1/2 to 1~o concentration of specific antiserum against the given immunoglobulin in question. The plates are then subject to electrophoresis (7-8 V/cm for 3 to 5 hr) during which a precipitating line develops in the region of optimal proportions of the antigen and antibody. After electrophoresis, the plates are washed and stained in a similar way as other immunoelectophoretic slides. After washing out the unprecipitated protein, the precipitates are stained. Figure 6 illustrates \"rockets\" of IgA from dog serum. Because IgG migrates to both poles from the well, the well has to be located close to the center of the agarose plate and the resulting precipitating line has a cigar shape (Fig. 7) . The multiple of the length times average width of the \"rocket\" or \"cigar\" is directly proportional to the concentration of the immunoglobulin in the serum. We have successfully used both the original barbitalsodium barbital-calcium lactate buffer (pH 8.6, ionic strength 0.015 for agarose and 0.025 for vessels) [23] and Tris-tricine-calcium lactate buffer (pH 8.6:0.08 M Tris, 0.024 M Tricine, 0.3 mM calcium lactate, and 0.02\u00b0/0 sodium azide) marketed as QIEP IV buffer (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). A set of controls with known immunoglobulin concentrations is included with each set of samples. The immunoglobulin estimation may be completed in one day. The accuracy is comparable to or better than in radial immunodiffusion.",

Because the IgM class of immunoglobulins has substantially shorter halflife than IgG class (approximately by 2/3), and because it is absorbed in smaller amounts from the colostrum, colostral IgM disappears from the blood circulation sooner. Its subnormal levels are used as an indicator of immunodeficiency in young animals, in which the levels of circulating IgG may be normal due to the persistence of absorbed colostral IgG. Thus, these IgM deficiencies may be detected by the last three mentioned tests; i.e. radial immunodiffusion, rocket or crossed immunoelectrophoresis, but not by zinc sulfate precipitation or glutaraldehyde coagulation.",

Thus, in order to obtain reproducible results, the blood handling and storage and the testing conditions must be scrupulously standardized. A control sample tested earlier must be included with each set of tests. We recommend using 45-60 min room temperature clotting time, ice water bath temperature after that time, and harvesting the serum sample no later than 1.5 to 2 hr after blood collection. If a secondary \"white\" clot appears in the serum after storage, the resulting titer is decreased. Samples of horse and sometimes cattle sera are most commonly forming secondary clots.

It is recommended to use both optimal (giving peak thymidine incorporation) and suboptimal mitogen doses, because in some defects only the response to suboptimal doses is affected [68] . Use of specific bacterial or viral mitogens has relatively small importance in clinical immunology, because in most cases simpler techniques may detect infection with the given bacteria or viruses.

We found the background CPM in clinically healthy dogs varying in considerably smaller range (100-400) than in cattle or horses (200 to over 2000) . A mistake would be made by reporting only stimulation indices (i.e. reciprocal of CPM of stimulated cells divided by CPM of unstimulated cells), as well as by reporting only the CPM of stimulated cells. The stimulation indices may be decreased either by decreasing the stimulated cells' CPM and/or by increasing the background CPM. We have found decreased responsiveness of lyrnphocytes to the phytomitogens in numerous infectious and lymphoreticular diseases caused by either of the following: (1) the presence of serum immunosuppressive factors in the patient serum, (2) the decreased response of lymphocytes per se to the mitogens, or (3) the increased mitogenicity of lymphocytes due to unidentified serum factors in absence of phytomitogens [62] .",

It must be emphasized that the titer is a reciprocal of the dilution of the anti-IgG or C3 antiserum which only reflects the density of autoantibodies on the red blood cells tested. The so-called \"Coombs reagent\", which should contain antibodies to both IgG and C3, is commercially prepared for testing dog red blood cells, but may give negative results in some cases when either anti-IgG or anti-C3 sera alone will give agglutination.
