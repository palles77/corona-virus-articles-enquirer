In most of these published studies, virus detection was ascertained only in symptomatic infants. In others, surveillance for respiratory virus pathogens was initiated only after an outbreak was established. Of note, respiratory viral infections (RVIs) were detected in minimally symptomatic and even asymptomatic infants when widespread screening was instituted during outbreaks [3] . Moreover, premature infants often have atypical symptoms of infection, such as feeding difficulty, periodic breathing or apnea [8] [9] [10] . Reports of NICU outbreaks generally have focused on a single infectious agent, and studies extending to multiple viruses are hampered by the technical limitations associated with routine assays such as antigen detection and virus culture. Recent developments in multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing permit rapid, sensitive testing of multiple viruses from a single specimen, including viruses for which culture is unavailable and/or unreliable or for which rapid antigen assays do not exist. In this study we report on the results of a year-long surveillance study in two NICUs in Syracuse, New York, in which infants' nasopharyngeal specimens were tested in longitudinal fashion from birth to discharge for 17 different viruses.",

            "text": "A prospective, observational study of premature infants in two NICUs in Syracuse, NY, during one calendar year (2009) was performed. Infants were deemed eligible if they were born at less than 33 weeks 0 days gestational age and were available for enrollment within 3 days of arrival in the NICU, which included transfer from another facility or following hospital birth. Neonates with medical and surgical diagnoses were included. Gestational age was determined by menstrual dates and confirmed by ultrasound. Infants were excluded if they had a known or suspected immune deficiency, or were born to an HIV-positive mother. After obtaining informed consent, nasopharyngeal flocked swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Inc., Corona, CA) were collected from each infant by study personnel trained in the proper procedure for obtaining a nasopharyngeal specimen (including intubated infants to ensure sample consistency) within 3 days of birth and on a regular twice weekly (Monday/ Thursday) schedule thereafter until discharge. Sampling was deferred on a particular day if it was deemed to place the infant at risk. Specimens were placed in 1.5 mL universal transport media (Copan) and frozen at \u221270\u00b0 C prior to testing with the xTAG\u00ae Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP, Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada). RVP is a multiplex PCR assay that detects influenza A H1, H3, and nonspecific; influenza B; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B; parainfluenza (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4; coronavirus 229E, NL63, HKU-1 and OC43; rhinovirus/enterovirus; adenovirus; and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Clinical and demographic data were collected from the medical records. At each sampling timepoint, the use of mechanical ventilation and percent of inspired oxygen was recorded, along with the results of any microbiologic testing performed for appropriate clinical purposes. Clinical events (episodes of oxygen desaturation, bradycardia or apnea) were recorded daily according to the existing criteria being used routinely by the nursing staff in both NICUs. To qualify as an event, the aforementioned change had to persist for longer than 20 seconds. Oxygen saturation below 88% and a heart rate below 100 beats per minute were the cutoff points used for desaturation and bradycardia events, respectively. Clinical deteriorations were defined as a sustained (lasting three days) increase in daily oxygen desaturation events from the prior baseline rate, an increase in oxygen requirement (as judged by the current inhaled oxygen concentration required for stable oxygen saturations, excluding transient desaturations associated with feeding), or an increased level of respiratory support (moving from nasal cannula to continuous positive airways pressure, to intubation or mechanical ventilation). A diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was made if an infant required supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks post-conceptional age.",

Throughout the study period, each NICU operated under its usual infection control procedures: all staff employed an extended hand and arm scrub on arrival to the unit, and standard precautions were in place at all times. All direct patient contact by medical staff required gloves. Contact precautions also were in place (gown and glove) for patients known to be colonized or infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA screening by PCR was performed on all patients at the regional center on a weekly basis. All children (age 17 yrs and younger) were excluded from the units and adult visitors were excluded if ill. Parents who had respiratory symptoms were discouraged from visiting but allowed to visit if they wore gowns, gloves, and a surgical mask. In the regional center NICU, twin and triplet births were separated into different nursing areas. No healthcare personnel were aware of the results of the respiratory virus detection tests during the study.",

Time to infection was calculated as the interval between birth date and infection date for the first infection and the interval between previous and current infection dates for repeated infections. The marginal effects of several variables, including NICU units, gender, gestational age and birth weight on time to infection were presented by Kaplan-Meier infection-free probability curves and tested by log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was further fitted to examine the effect of each covariate, adjusting the effect of other covariates. A random-effect term was included to adjust the dependence among the multiple observations from the same infant. The proportional hazards assumption and possible outliers were visually examined through Schoenfeld and Deviance residual plots. A path model, focusing on the direct and indirect effects of infection on the hospital stay, was proposed and confirmed by using SAS9.2 proc CALIS under which the algorithm was optimized via a Quasi-Newton method. Statistical significance was defined at a level of 0.05. ",

Eighteen samples (28% of the positive swabs) included more than one virus and some infants were positive for different viruses at different times. There was evidence of seasonality of infection with particular viruses, with clusters of detection being observed (Figure 1 ). Fourteen patients had sequential positive specimens for the same virus, with specimens positive over a range of 3-13 days, however because we obtained specimens only twice weekly an accurate determination of duration cannot be made.

The detection of viral nucleic acid from the respiratory tract of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infants (none of the infants in the study displayed symptoms typical of RVI or were evaluated for RVI by the NICU clinicians) raises the question of whether these events represent true infection. In the absence of data documenting seroconversion, our observation documenting 14 instances of prolonged serial detection suggest ongoing virus replication rather than transient carriage. Moreover, of the viruses included in the detection panel, only adenovirus is known to persist in the nasopharynx, although respiratory viruses have been detected in asymptomatic older children. Detection of viral nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal secretions in our study correlated significantly and directly with several specific negative outcomes, inferring a possible causal relationship.

Premature neonates with RVIs can display atypical symptoms or can have no overt, recognizable symptoms. However, the detection of RVIs within a NICU can have profound clinical implications. Infants with detectable RVIs, even those without overt symptoms, had greater supplemental oxygen requirements, high likelihood of mechanical ventilation, required longer durations of oxygenation, and were hospitalized longer. Persistent detection of virus was associated with clinical deteriorations. In addition, there was a higher rate of BPD in the virus-infected population, an observation clearly worthy of further study. The expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung have been implicated in the etiology of BPD [12] , in association with chorioamnionitis [13] and prolonged mechanical ventilation [14, 15] . Nosocomial RVIs may exacerbate the inflammation that already occurs secondary to positive pressure ventilation, prematurity and/ or supplemental oxygen therapy and may contribute to the development of chronic lung disease of prematurity. The effect of RVI on length of stay appeared to be mediated through effects on the respiratory system. Path analysis and linear regression analysis of our data showed significant direct and indirect effects of infection on length of stay.",

Sample containers remained sealed from collection until laboratory RNA extraction.

There were no weeks when specimen collection did not occur. A limitation of our study is the difficulty in proving that detection of an RVI is due to ongoing viral replication.

Of the 11 positive bacterial cultures in infants infected with a viral pathogen, some were repeatedly positive for the same organism. In addition, one virus-infected infant had two separate blood cultures growing coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Klebsiella, and another had three separate cultures positive for Klebsiella sp, MRSA and Candida sp. The 6 positive blood cultures from infants who never had a virus detected occurred in 4 infants with 2 sets being repeatly positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis. All clinical deteriorations and clinical events noted in study patients were reviewed, and changes in respiratory support were associated with coincident oxygen desaturation events. Compared with virus-infected infants, uninfected infants displayed few clinical deteriorations beyond the first few days of life; 38 clinical deteriorations occurred in 26 infected infants, versus 8 clinical deteriorations in 24 uninfected infants. During 27 (71%) clinical deteriorations, RVI was detected simultaneously. All 14 episodes of sequential detections of RVIs were associated with clinical deteriorations.
