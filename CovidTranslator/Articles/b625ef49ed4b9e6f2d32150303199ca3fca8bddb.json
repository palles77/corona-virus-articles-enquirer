However, many proteins/peptides have the disadvantage of poor stability, short half-life, and uncertain targeting ability. Chemical modification can be used to overcome these disadvantages; many polyethylene glycol-modified proteins/peptides have been approved by US FDA. The purpose of this study was to obtain a novel anti-angiogenic chondroitin sulfate (CS)-peptide nanoparticle conjugate with efficient anti-neovascularization and tumor targeting ability and an acceptable half-life.",

The anti-angiogenic ability was studied using MTT, migration, tube formation, and chick chorioallantoic membrane assays. The targeting ability of CS-ES2-AF was studied by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and bioimaging. The pharmacokinetics was also studied. Results: The CS-ES2-AF could self-assemble into stable nanoparticles in aqueous solution, which significantly enhances its anti-neovascularization activity, tumor targeting more explicit, and prolongs its half-life. Conclusion: CS is an effective protein/peptide modifier, and CS-ES2-AF displayed good potential in tumor targeting therapy.",

CS-modified cisplatin displayed improved anti-cancer activity and reduced drug toxicity. 3 CS-modified glucocorticoids can prolong the release time of the drug in vivo and enhance the efficacy, without toxicity or side effects. 4 In addition, CS is also a ligand of CD44, which can specifically target the CD44-overexpressed tumor cells. [5] [6] [7] [8] A short peptide, ES2, containing eleven amino acids (IVRRADRAAVP) is the main active fragment of endostatin (ES), which has anti-angiogenic properties. We have studied the bioactivity of ES2 and found that it could effectively inhibit the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. 9 A VEGFR1-selective hexapeptide (GNQWFI, AF) was 15-mL centrifuge tubes were purchased from Corning INC (New York, NY, USA).

            "text": "The inhibitory effect of ES2-AF and CS-ES2-AF on the proliferation of the endothelial cells was measured by MTT assay. 9, 21, 22, 42 As shown in Figure 3A , when the concentrations of ES2-AF were 5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u03bcg/mL, the IRs of EA.hy926 endothelial cells were 8.38%\u00b11.29%, 25 .72%\u00b13.55%, and 33.01%\u00b13.63%, respectively. From these results, it can be seen that the IRs of ES2-AF and CS-ES2-AF on EA.hy926 cells showed concentrationdependent effect ranging from 5 \u03bcg/mL to 200 \u03bcg/mL. The inhibitory rates of ES2-AF and CS-ES2-AF were similar (5 \u03bcg/mL-100 \u03bcg/mL), which indicated that the activity of ES2-AF was similar to CS-ES2-AF at relatively low concentrations. When the concentration increased, the IR of CS-ES2-AF was higher than that of ES2-AF at the same concentration, which indicated that the activity of CS-ES2-AF was significantly better than that of ES2-AF at high concentrations. The activity of polypeptide drugs is often related to their structure. Compared to small molecule drugs, polypeptide drugs often have poor aqueous stability due to their spatial structure. When the anti-angiogenic peptide ES2-AF was modified with CS, the stability of the conjugate in aqueous solution improved. This is due to the fact that the CS group in the aqueous solution forces the water molecules around the ES2-AF polypeptide to enhance the stability of ES2-AF. Therefore, it can be inferred that the higher the concentration of CS, the better the stability of ES2-AF. In addition, the results of the MTT assay are also related to the state of endothelial cells and the degree of differentiation. Therefore, when the MTT assay is used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of drugs on endothelial cell proliferation, cells with similar passage numbers should be selected for experiments. cell migration assay EA.hy926 cells were co-cultured in cell culture medium containing different concentrations of ES2-AF, CS&ES2-AF, and CS-ES2-AF for 48 hours and photographed under a fluorescence microscope to obtain a graph of the cell migration. The initial position of the scratch was marked with a black solid line ( Figure 4A ). As shown in Figure 4D For different samples at the same concentration, the activity of CS-ES2-AF was higher than the activity of ES2-AF, and when the concentrations were 50 \u03bcg/mL and 100 \u03bcg/mL, the effect of CS-ES2-AF on the endothelial cell migration was significantly better than that of ES2-AF. Like the MTT assay results, even when the concentration was relatively low, CS could improve the solubility of ES2-AF. CS could increase the number of water molecules near ES2-AF and increase the stability of ES2-AF. Thus, CS-ES2-AF could inhibit the endothelial cell metastasis more efficiently than ES2-AF. When the concentration was increased to 200 \u03bcg/mL, the inhibitory effect of CS-ES2-AF on the endothelial cells was similar to that of ES2-AF. Thus, CS could promote the adhesion and growth of endothelial cells, and, to a certain extent, counteract the inhibitory effect of ES2-AF.",

The anti-angiogenic ability of the drug is expressed as a percentage of neovascularization. 28, 29 Under the stereoscopic microscope, the CAM vascular network of the control group showed a clear vein-like distribution after the addition of physiological saline and bFGF ( Figure 4C ). The number of small vessels generated around the main vessel increased, the small blood vessels grew exuberantly, and then, produced more branches, thereby increasing the density of the whole blood vessels in the field. Within the same drug group, the density of the blood vessels decreased significantly when the concentration of the drug increased, which showed that the activity of the CAM was positively correlated with the concentration. At the same concentrations, the activity of the CS&ES2-AF mixture group was slightly less than the other two groups. The chemically modified product CS-ES2-AF had the smallest number of small blood vessels around the main blood vessels, and almost no visible small blood vessels existed in the field of view under the stereoscope. To corroborate the above results, the newly generated vessels in each group were statistically analyzed ( Figure 4F ). After drug treatment for 24 hours, the neovascularization rate of the control group was 48.75%\u00b12.27%. When the concentrations of drug were 10 \u03bcg/mL, 25 \u03bcg/mL, and 50 \u03bcg/mL, the neovascularization rates in the CS-ES2-AF group were 34.40%\u00b11.54%, 27.14%\u00b12.08%, and 18.25%\u00b12.62%, respectively. At these same concentrations, the proportions of new vessels in the ES2-AF and CS&ES2-AF groups were 32.29%\u00b12.54%, 28.02%\u00b11.23%, and 26.02%\u00b12.28%; and 38.11%\u00b11.81%, 30.51%\u00b13.13%, and 23.79%\u00b12.29%, respectively. Comparing the groups, it was found that when the concentration was 10 \u03bcg/mL-25 \u03bcg/mL, there was no significant difference in the activity of ES2-AF and the modified product CS-ES2-AF. When the concentration was 10 \u03bcg/mL, the activity of CS-ES2-AF was lower than that of the unmodified polypeptide ES2-AF. This might be due to the water-soluble CS forming a gel-like barrier near ES2-AF at low concentrations, affecting the contact between ES2-AF and the chicken embryos, thereby reducing the effect of ES2-AF, and making the conjugates less active at low concentration. When the concentration was 50 \u03bcg/mL, the CS-ES2-AF activity was higher than the unmodified polypeptide ES2-AF. This might be due to the increase in stability of CS-ES2-AF in vivo, thereby improving the activity.",

The distribution and metabolism of the drug ES2-AF-FITC in nude mice were as follows. At 0.5 hour, ES2-AF-FITC was distributed throughout the whole body of the nude mice. Fluorescence appeared in the tumor; there was no significant difference between the fluorescence intensity in the tumor cells and in the other parts of the mice. The image showed that ES2-AF-FITC had entered the tumor tissue. At 1 hour, the fluorescence intensity within the tumor weakened, indicating that some ES2-AF-FITC had been metabolized. At 2 hours and 4 hours, there was a strong fluorescent signal in the urethral opening of the nude mice, indicating that the ES2-AF-FITC had circulated in the body and entered the bladder from the kidneys, which was excreted in the form of urine. When CS-ES2-AF-FITC was used, a strong fluorescence signal was observed at the tumor site and in the cervical lymph nodes near the tumor at 0.5 hours, indicating that there was a large CS-ES2-AF-FITC distribution. The fluorescence signals in the other parts of the mice were weak, indicating that the distribution of CS-ES2-AF-FITC in the tumor-bearing nude mice was regular. At 1, 2, and 4 hours, the fluorescence signal still appeared in the tumor site, and the fluorescence intensity was stronger than in the other tissues in the body. At the same time, almost no fluorescence appeared at the tumor site of the ES2-AF-FITC group, indicating that the metabolism of CS-ES2-AF-FITC was slower than ES2-AF-FITC. This is because glycosylation induces structural changes in the conjugates and polysaccharide chain increases the steric hindrance of the conjugate. This improves the drug's ability to resist hydrolysis by hydrolase enzymes, making it stable in the blood, thereby demonstrating that a glycosylation modification can prolong the stability of a drug in the body. The fluorescence intensity of the glycosylated compound at the tumor site was stronger than the polypeptide group, demonstrating that CS had a certain ability to target tumor tissue in B16-bearing nude mice, which was consistent with the SPR experimental results.",

When ES2-AF enters the endothelial cells, the ES2 fragment can inhibit the phosphorylation process of the nucleolus, directly affecting the biosynthesis and maturation of ribosomes and indirectly influencing the process of chromatin replication and nucleogenesis. Then, the mitotic process of the endothelial cells is arrested, inhibiting the endothelial cell proliferation. 45 The MTT assay was used to evaluate the inhibitory effects of ES2-AF and its glycosylation modification products on the proliferation of EA.hy926 cells. It was found that the inhibitory activities of both the drugs were dose-dependent. The activity of polypeptide drugs is often related to their structure. Compared with small molecule drugs, polypeptide drugs tend to have poor stability in aqueous solution due to their spatial structure. The peptide ES2-AF was modified with CS, and the stability of the modified product CS-ES2-AF was improved in aqueous solution. The CS can increase the solubility of ES2-AF in aqueous solution as the CS group forces water molecules around the polypeptide ES2-AF to improve the stability of ES2-AF. Moreover, the higher the concentration of ES2-AF, the more the stability of ES2-AF. Previous research also supports this conclusion. 46 In addition, MTT results are also related to cell status and degree of differentiation, so cells with better status should be selected for experiments.",

ES2, as the main active fragment of ES, also has the ability to stably bind to the precursor proteins of matrix metalloproteinase. The results of cell metastasis showed that the activity of CS-ES2-AF in inhibiting cell metastasis was significantly better than unmodified ES2-AF at low concentrations, and there was no significant difference between CS-ES2-AF and ES2-AF at high concentration. In agreement with the results of MTT, the efficiency of CS in improving the solubility of ES2-AF increased at low drug concentration. Therefore, CS-ES2-AF was more efficient in inhibiting endothelial cell metastasis than ES2-AF. When the concentration was increased, the activity of the two drugs was equivalent, which might be due to CS promoting the adhesion and growth of endothelial cells to counteract the inhibition of ES2-AF at a certain degree. 48 Endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation are the vital parts in neovascularization.

At the same time, endothelial cell migration and tube formation is a continuous process. ES can disrupt the integrity of microfilaments, thereby disrupting normal adhesion between these endothelial cells and between the endothelial cells and the matrix. Ultimately, the growth of endothelial cells is limited and the formation of vessels is blocked. 51 The CAM model is a widely used angiogenic model due to its many advantages: cost effectiveness, short experiment period, high reproducibility, and easy handling. In the experiment, normal saline was used as the control group and a small amount of bFGF was added to each group. bFGF is an inducing factor for vascular growth, which makes the results of neovascularization more obvious. The result showed that the activity of CS-ES2-AF in the high-concentration group was better than ES2-AF, which could be because the stability of CS-ES2-AF was better than that of ES2-AF. However, comparing the results of mixture group with that of peptide group at a low concentration condition, it was found that adding CS in mixture had an effect on the activity of peptide and could increase the activity of mixture. It was also found that the activity of conjugated group was slightly lower than that of peptide group at this concentration. This phenomenon may be due to the fact that CS in the conjugate could form a gellike barrier structure near ES2-AF at a lower concentration. Therefore, the conjugate and mixture groups were inferior in activity at low concentrations.",

The water solubility of AF is poor due to its high content of aromatic amino acids. Therefore, AF was modified with ES2 peptide by solid-phase synthesis to improve its water solubility. Then, ES2-AF was modified with CS, a better water-soluble mucopolysaccharide, to further improve the water-solubility of ES2-AF.

The isoelectric point of CD44 was pH 5.15, so the optimum pH value of CD44 protein solution was 3.8 after screening.

            "text": "In the pharmacokinetic study of peptide drugs, several commonly used methods include isotopic tracer method, 61 ELISA, 10 liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), 62, 63 and fluorescence labeling. At present, the US FDA uses the pharmacokinetic data obtained by radioisotope determination of peptide drugs for the effective evaluation of the safety of the drugs. However, polypeptides labeled with radioisotopes, such as 125 I are prone to be labeled off-label during the experiment, as they are unable to accurately reflect the concentration of the polypeptide drugs from the measured radioactivity. This method also has the shortcomings of radioactive contamination, thus limiting its application in clinical pharmacokinetics research. Although ELISA method is simple and convenient to operate, it is necessary to develop related antibody-coated kits. The preparation period of the kit is not long and it is not susceptible to interference by biological endogenous and exogenous substances during the measurement process. The LC/MS has the advantages of good specificity and high sensitivity. However, plasma samples contain a large amount of salts and endogenous proteins, which may interfere with the measurement process. Fluorescence labeling has been used by increasing number of people because of its mild reaction conditions and simple detection method.",

As a common fluorescent marker, FITC, due to its mild labeling reaction conditions, is often used to label polysaccharides and polypeptides to study their pharmacokinetic process in animals. In this study, FITC was used to label ES2-AF. FITC could be linked to several amino acids in the ES2-AF peptide chain. After dialysis, free FITC was removed and ES2-AF-FITC and CS-ES2-AF-FITC samples were prepared.",

The addition of SDS could produce a large amount of premicelles in the sample system due to which the FITC-labeled molecules dispersed and adhered to the micelle system. The collision energy loss between the fluorescent molecules was reduced, the quenching effect of oxygen was reduced, and the absorption interface of fluorescent groups was increased. The fluorescence sensitization by the SDS solution brought order to the fluorophore microenvironment in biological samples. This reduced the competition with other non-radiative deactivators and fluorescence quenching processes in the system, and improved the quantum yield of fluorescence. This was manifested by an increase in the fluorescence intensity of the sample.",

The reason for this phenomenon might be because the fluorescence intensity of FITC represents the concentration of ES2-AF in this study, but the metabolism of FITC and ES2-AF was not completely synchronized in vivo, and ES2-AF-FITC and free FITC might coexist in mouse plasma, which affected the determination of the results.

First, 1 H-NMR spectrum showed that CS successfully bound to ES2-AF and that there were two peptides per one CS chain. Then, the in vitro activities of ES2-AF and CS-ES2-AF were studied. The results showed that CS-ES2-AF had better ability to inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of endothelial cells than ES2-AF. Then, the binding ability of ES2-AF and CS-ES2-AF in vitro and in vivo was studied. ELISA results showed that the glycosylation-modified product CS-ES2-AF inhibited the binding ability of VEGF to its receptor, better than the peptide ES2-AF; SPR results showed that the binding ability of CS-ES2-AF to CD44 receptor was better than that of ES2-AF; in vivo imaging experiments showed that the distribution of CS-ES2-AF in tumor-bearing nude mice was targeted. In addition, bioimaging results showed that CS-ES2-AF had a longer metabolic time compared to ES2-AF in vivo, which may be due to the increased stability of CS-ES2-AF in plasma. That was consistent with the in vivo half-life experiments. The half-life of CS-ES2-AF was approximately threefold longer than that of ES2-AF. These data strongly suggest that CS has the desired effect of extending the half-life of this peptide drug.",
