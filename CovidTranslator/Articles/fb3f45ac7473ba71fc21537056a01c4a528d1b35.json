For this study, we determined the genome sequences of BYD1 and the S1 gene sequences of other five mammalian reovirus isolates (BLD, JP, and BYL were isolated from different SARS patients during the outbreak, 302I and 302II were isolated from fecal specimens of two children of Beijing in 1982) to allow molecular comparison with other previously reported mammalian reoviruses (MRVs). Comparative analyses of the BYD1 genome with those of three prototype mammalian reovirus strains demonstrated that BYD1 is a novel reassortant virus, with its S1 gene segment coming from a previously unidentified serotype 2 isolate and other nine segments coming from ancestors of homologous T1L and T3D segments, which supports the hypothesis that mammalian reovirus gene segments reassort in nature. Further analyses of the S1 segments of the six isolates showed that all the isolates are novel serotype 2 MRVs based on their S1 gene sequences, which are markedly different from those of all previously reported, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share more than 99% identity with each other, proving that they diverged from a common ancestor most recently, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share about 65% identity with those of the two strains isolated in 1982.",

They contain a genome of ten dsRNA segments encoding eight structural proteins and three nonstructural proteins [4] . Three large (L1-L3), three medium (M1-M3), and four small (S1-S4) segments can be distinguished in polyacrylamide gels [5] . MRV isolates (or ''strains'') can be grouped into three serotypes, represented by three commonly studied prototype isolates: type 1 Lang (T1L), type 2 Jones (T2J), and type 3 Dearing (T3D). The genome sequences of three prototype MRV strains have been reported [6] [7] [8] . The lengths of six of the ten genome segments (L1, L3, M2, S2, S3, and S4) are invariant among the three prototype isolates. The lengths of three other segments (L2, M1, and M3) vary by only one to four bases, but the S1 genome segment is unique to each MRV strain and shows the greatest difference [9] . The S1 segment encodes the cell attachment protein r1 which also specifies tissue tropism, serotype, and hemagglutination, and the nonstructural protein r1s, while each of the other nine segments encodes one protein [10, 11] .",

We previously reported isolation and partial characterization of a new MRV strain, designated BYD1, isolated from throat swabs of one patient of Beijing with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hep-2 cell cultures, and SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was also isolated from the same samples in Vero-E6 cell cultures [17] . In our previous study, three other MRV strains, designated BLD, JP, and BYL, were isolated from different SARS patients [18] . All the four MRV strains were purified by plaque assay and were identified as MRV serotype 2 members by virus neutralization.

The genetic diversity within MRVs is independent of viral serotype, and that MRV genes have distinct evolutionary histories has been demonstrated. For this study we examined the positions and types of nucleotide mismatches between BYD1 and the prototype strains to gain a comprehensive view of the evolutionary divergence of the protein-coding sequences. Most mismatches in any of the codon base positions between BYD1 and T2J segments are far greater than those between BYD1 and either T1L or T3D segments. Each of these mismatch percentages was The types of amino acid substitutions within each of the BYD1' proteins were also examined. Pairwise analyses showed that most substitutions in most proteins were conservative ( Table 2) . Nonconservative substitutions were relatively rare in most proteins' pairwise comparisons. For example, comparison of the BYD1 and T1L lNS proteins showed none (0.0%) of the 39 amino acid substitutions were nonconservative, and most BYD1:T1L comparisons gave low nonconservative substitution values ranging from 0.0 to 0.6% of total amino acid residues within the respective proteins. Only rNS and r3 proteins demonstrated higher nonconservative variation, with values greater than 1.4% of total amino acid residues. Most of these higher nonconservative substitution values were observed when BYD1 proteins were compared to T2J proteins.",

The MRV BYD1 strain analyzed here was isolated from the throat swabs of one SARS patient of Beijing. Comparative analyses of the BYD1 genome with those of three prototype strains demonstrated that this newly isolated virus is a novel human MRV isolate and also a reassortant virus, with the S1 segment coming from a previously unidentified serotype 2 isolate and other nine segments coming from ancestors of homologous T1L and T3D segments, which supports the hypothesis that MRV gene segments reassort in nature. Further analyses of the S1 segments of the four new MRV isolates and two earlier isolates confirmed that the four new isolates were new serotype 2 strains and showed greater sequence diversity of both the S1 genes and the deduced r1 proteins. Compared to three prototype strains, the BYD1 strain had highly conserved proteins encoded by non-S1 segments, suggesting that the evolution of MRV non-S1 segments had reached equilibrium. Analyses of the S1 genes of the four newly isolated strains suggested that the N-terminal region of r1 protein was perhaps more prone to variation than the C-terminal region. In these regards, this study enhanced our understanding of MRV evolution. The sequences of the S1 segments of the other three new MRV isolates also proved that the four new isolates diverged from a common ancestor most recently. The BLD strain and JP strain were both isolated from throat swabs of SARS patients. Notably, the BYL strain was isolated from the lung tissue sample of one dead SARS patient. Although MRV infection has been shown quite common in the human population, no MRV isolates from human lung tissues had been reported before. Comparative analyses of the S1 genes of the six human MRV isolates used in this study support previous observations of the MRV protein r1, including remarkable degree of variation in size, gene arrangement, and coding potential of polycistronic S-Class genome segments. The isolations of the four highly homologous MRVs from multiple relevant SARS patients suggest that the novel MRVs may simultaneously spread with SARS-CoV in certain cases and they might have been undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in more cases.",

However, although MRV infections have been shown widely present in humans, these agents are isolated only rarely from clinical samples. In this regard, it is worth noting that the four novel MRV isolates used in this study were successively isolated from clinical samples of unambiguous SARS patients. It should be noted that all the four isolates were found to be mixed with poliovirus type 1 (vaccine strain) in our follow-up studies (data not shown). In a follow-up study, poliovirus type 1 RNAs were detected positive in four of eight fecal specimens from persons who had recovered from SARS for 2 years and two back mutations occurred in their primary attenuating mutation sites at nucleotide position 480 (G ? A) in the 5 0 UTR and nucleotide position 2795 (A ? G) in the VP1 gene, while MRV and SARS-CoV RNAs were detected negative in all the specimens [32] . Although SARS-CoV has been accepted as the primary causative agent of SARS by the scientific community, this pathogen could not be identified from nearly 60% of the patients during the outbreak in Beijing [33] . In a previous review, Fan and Li [34] highlighted the possibility of MRV co-infections in SARS patients. However, at this stage we do not have serological evidence to prove poliovirus type 1 or MRV coinfections in SARS.

According the results the BYD1 is a novel human MRV isolate and also a reassortant virus, all the six strains are novel type 2 MRVs based on their S1 sequences, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates, which only share about 65% identity with those of 302I and 302II, diverged from a common ancestor most recently. Further serological surveillance in SARS patients will allow a better understanding of the epidemiology of the novel MRVs.",
