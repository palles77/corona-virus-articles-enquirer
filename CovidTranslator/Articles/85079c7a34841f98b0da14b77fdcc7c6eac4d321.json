Morbidity may approach 100% and mortality ranges from 1 to 44% (Yvore et al., 1984; Thamsborg et al., 1990) . Besides C. parvum, several agents have been incriminated in neonatal-kid diarrhea including Escherichia cob K99, rotavirus, coronavirus and adenovirus (Gouet, 1984) . Until now, more than 140 drugs have been tested for anticryptosporidial activity in man and animals and only five of them were effective in controlling the infection without causing important side effects: alborixin, azithromycin, halofuginone, maduramycin and paromomycin (Fayer, 1993) . The most promising results were obtained with paromomycin in curing symptoms of cryptosporidiosis in AIDS patients (Fichtenbaum et al., 1993) and in preventing development of C. paruum in experimentally infected mice and calves (Fayer, 1993) .",

The first group consisted of 18 kids; of these, nine had been born on 9 February and had been treated with paromomycin; the other nine, born 2 days later were untreated controls. The second group (II = 12), born the same day 1 week later, was divided into treated (n = 7) and control (n = 5) kids using a random numbers generator. The treatment was conducted by the farmer with paromomycin sulfate (HUMfiEL enfants, Parke-Davis, France) at a total daily dose rate of 100 mg kg-' body weight (SW) for 11 consecutive days beginning at 2 days of age (Fayer and Ellis, 1993) . The powdered drug was dispensed into water and given orally with a syringe in two daily dosages. Feces samples were individually taken with rectal curettes every 3 or 4 days from days 4-5 to days 15-19. Demonstration of oocysts was made by staining fecal smears with Ziehl fuchsin and observing at X 100 magnification under a phase-contrast microscope according to Heine ( 1982) . Oocyst numbers were scored semi-quantitatively on a scale from 0 to 5: 0, no oocyst; 1, less than one oocyst per field; 2, I-10 oocysts; 3, 1 l-20 oocysts; 4, 21-30 oocysts; 5, more than 30 oocysts. The presence or absence of diarrhea was recorded blind by the farmer's wife on a daily basis. Kids were weighed at the age of 2, 6 and 10 days with a stand-on scale ( +50 g). Comparisons of the weights and mean daily weight gains between groups were made by one-tailed Mann-Whitney test at the 0.05 level of confidence on each set of kids.",

The paucity of adverse effects in man (Clezy et al., 1991) and the very high LD,e in mice ( 15 000 mg kg-' orally) may be attributable to the lack of systemic absorption. Our results seemed to indicate, at least in the few treated animals of this study, that paromomycin is well tolerated. In addition, the poor absorption may lead to a very limited distribution of paromomycin residues in kid organs and thus to a very short meat withdrawal time. This aspect is of concern in France where dairy-goat farmers produce commercial kids which are slaughtered at a very early age (28 days). One of the most limiting factor in using paromomycin, besides the work constraint, could be the cost as this drug is not available for veterinary use in France. The administration of human medicine packaged paromomycin to a kid for 11 days is very expensive (35 French Francs) and represents 15-40% of the kid gross margin. However, in the case of replacement female kids, this high cost is of less concern.",
