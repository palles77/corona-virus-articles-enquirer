This work was undertaken to test the hypothesis that low molecular weight SB-AHGs (MWB235 for the free SB) make better antiviral agents than high MW SB-AHGs (MW\\ 300). The plaque reduction assay method demonstrated that three compounds, I, VII and IX, had moderate activity against HSV-1, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values of 38.0, 23.5 and 52.1 mM, respectively. Against Ad 5, compounds I, VIII and XI exhibited moderate activity, with IC 50 values of 52.7, 19.3 and 5.1 mM, respectively. Among the compounds screened, compound I (1-[(3%-hydroxy-6%-methyl-2%-pyridyl)methylene]amino-3-hydroxyguanidine tosylate) was the most promising antiviral candidate, with selectivity indices (SI) of 10.2 (HSV-1) and 7.6 (Ad 5), respectively. Virus yield reduction assays indicated that compound I had less antiviral potency against HSV-1 than against Ad 5. The antiviral effects of compound I at a high input virus multiplicity of infection (MOI \\ 5) indicated that compound I had effective anti-adenoviral activity at 24 h post infection. This work demonstrated that some of SB-AHGs only have moderate antiviral activities against Ad 5 and HSV-1 viruses. In general, low MW SB-AHGs have low cytotoxicities to the host cells.",

Forty-seven different serotypes of Ad have been characterized, one third of which are associated with a variety of human diseases (Horwitz, 1990) . Although effective, oral enteric-coated vaccines can prevent diseases by Ad serotypes 4 and 7, these vaccines are used only in the military and are not licensed for administration to civilians. The common adenovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 5, which infect children, have not been attenuated. In spite of promising results achieved with some nucleoside analogues, such as [(S)-HPMPA], 2%nor-cyclic GMP, cidofovir (see Fig. 2 ) and ganciclovir, against adenoviral infections in in vitro (Gordon et al., 1991) and in vivo animal models , none of these are yet available for clinical use. Interferons may also have a beneficial effect (Mistchenko and Falcoff, 1987) , but their largescale synthesis is prohibitively expensive. Thus, a serious need exists for the development of specific agents to treat adenovirus-induced diseases in humans.",

Compounds with IC 50 s of micromolar range against Ad 5 and Ad 8 have been found (Hui et al., 1994) . Hence, it was postulated that synthesis of new SB-AHGs with proper structural features could yield potent, useful antiviral agents. Two indepen- dent studies published earlier had indicated that heterocyclic systems, particularly the pyridine and isoquinoline derivatives, had superior biological activities to those of other aromatic and heteroaromatic systems (Blanz et al., 1970; Spector et al., 1991) . It was also noted that of the SB-AHGs synthesized using benzaldehyde, salicylaldehyde, picolinaldehyde and isoquinolinaldehyde, single ring aromatic and heterocyclic compounds apparently had better antiviral activities than bulkier SB-AHGs. Thus, to confirm this hypothesis, two new heterocyclic SB-AHGs containing the picolinaldehyde ring system were synthesized, and screened along with nine other heterocyclic SB-AHGs for anti-adenoviral and anti-herpesviral activity.",

Using the growth medium, selected compounds were serially diluted from the stock to obtain concentrations ranging from 0.01 mM to a maximum of 300 mM (in the case of ADL 1), based on results of preliminary cytotoxicity studies.

After 2 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C, when the monolayers were nearly confluent, medium was removed, the monolayers were trypsinized, and the cells counted using a Coulter counter. Data were converted to determine % live cells, and dose response curves were plotted to determine TC 50 using the same program used for determining IC 50 values.

A higher concentration (approximately three times the IC 50 ) of the compound was used because compound I was nontoxic to A549 and Vero cells at concentrations of up to 150 mM and because a higher multiplicity of infection of the viruses was being used in these assays. Approximately 10 6 pfu of each virus was used to infect the cell monolayers instead of the 100 pfu that is typically used in the plaque reduction assay.

The yield of infectious virus was maximally reduced by about 2 logs at 24 h post infection, after which there was an apparent increase in the number of virus particles in the treated cells at almost the same rate as in the control cells. These results resemble an earlier study with Ad 8 and structurally similar compounds (Hui et al., 1994) , and support the observation that SB-AHGs probably inhibit an early stage of virus replication. However, in the HSV-1 virus yield reduction assay (Fig. 4 b) , there was no apparent reduction in yield with compound I 24 h post infection; but there was a modest reduction (sevenfold) at 48 h and a reduction of 25-fold (more than one log unit) at 72 h.

Compounds VII -XI (with MW's of 235-315 for the free Schiff bases) were highly cytotoxic to the host cells, and thus, they may have potential as effective antitumor agents since cytotoxicity against transformed cells is an important feature of antitumor activity.

However, the antiviral activities of substituted SB-AHGs may or may not be due to RR inhibition alone since these compounds are effective against DNA viruses (adenovirus, Hui et al., 1994) , RNA viruses (coronavirus or murine hepatitis virus, MHV, Wang et al., 1990 ) and the RNA tumor viruses (Rous sarcoma virus, RSV, Tai et al., 1984) . An earlier study showed that while the antitumor activities of SB-AHGs correlate significantly with RR inhibition, no such correlation exists between RR inhibition and antiviral activity in a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis of SB-AHGs against the growth of L1210 cells and transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts by RSV in vitro (Lien et al., 1989) . However, inhibition of RR as a mechanism of antiviral activity cannot be ruled out since mechanistic studies of inhibition of virus-induced RR by SB-AHGs have not been conducted. Wang et al. (1990) had proposed that both the antitumor and antiviral activities of SB-AHG are due to their potential for chelating divalent metal ions that are important cofactors for various enzymatic activities. It was also postulated that the probable mechanism of anti-adenoviral activity of SB-AHGs was chelation of the zinc ion (Zn ++ ) serving as part of the Zinc finger motif that is present in one of the two major proteins encoded by the immediate early region (E1A) gene product of the adenovirus (Hui et al., 1994) .
