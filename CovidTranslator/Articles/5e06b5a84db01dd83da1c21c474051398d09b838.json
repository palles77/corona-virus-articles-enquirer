After the invention of modernized vaccinations, the mortality rate due to flu virus has been considerably decreased, but there are chances of recurrent infestation. Vaccination, accompanying the emergence of new antiinfluenza agents, is necessary to fight against seasonal and pervasive influenza strains. Nowadays, most importance is given to the designing of inhibition agents of influenza neuraminidase, which has proved itself as an appropriate medicine for the prophylaxis and influenza infections therapy. Till now only four medicines have been accepted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to cure influenza ailment, of which two of these drugs have grown resistance for influenza A strains and hence are not in the application. Therefore, there are a numerous chances in this area for further development of antiviral therapy. The two recent drug mechanisms for inhibition of the influenza virus are the M2 proton channel, which involves the procedure of liberating virus particles from an infected host cell, and the neuraminidase (NA) enzyme, which works on the basis of viral recognition and entry into a host cell. Currently, neuraminidase inhibitors are the most frequently used FDA-approved treatments for the influenza virus, which is applied effectively as they have not developed any resistance yet within the virus. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are the drugs that function by affecting the activity of neuraminidase (NA) protein of the virus. The neuraminidase enzyme operates on the basis of cleaving the host cell sialic acid residues with viral hemagglutinin, in turn releasing the new viruses to carry forward and infect other healthy cells. The viral neuraminidase catalytic site is highly specific for all influenza A and B viruses. Both the drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir serve as stable transformation state counterparts of the sialosyl cation. It is a very unstable transformation state complex in the enzymatic procedure of viral sialidase. The neuraminidase inhibitor drugs 1 and 2 are similar enough in structure to the sialosyl cation transition state complex. It allows them to attach tightly to the sialic acid active site and obstruct viral budding. However, constant development of drug-resistant influenza strain enhances the need of continuous researches on innovative technologies for the production of new drugs with improved antiviral mechanism, more safety, and enhanced tolerability.",

Amantadine and rimantadine were approved for adult patients, but they were not able to prevent, treat, or reduce the severity of influenza A virus infestation in children and older ones.

First was peramivir, which could be administered as an intravenous injection, and the other was laninamivir octanoate, which was found to be effective if administered in an inhalation. Notably, peramivir has been found to have clinical potency equal to that of oseltamivir for curing the severe seasonal influenza, and the efficacy of laninamivir octanoate has been found for the treatment of seasonal influenza, as well as oseltamivir-resistant virus, in adults.

It was found to be the broadest spectrum antiviral agent ever reported for a synthetic material which did not induce interferon. The chief mechanism of its drug action includes the inhibition of inosine-5-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase, which helps in conversion of IMP to xanthosine monophosphate and thus responsible for the production of GTP. Ribavirin inhibits the IMP dehydrogenase and hence possesses immunosuppressive activity, which leads to the remarkable success of ribavirin, for the therapy of HCV infestation accompanied with peginterferon alfa-2a. The patients of HCV infection undergoing therapy of telaprevir, peginterferon alfa-2a, and ribavirin are found to have an outstanding level of response against the virus. Ribavirin effectively hinders the RNA polymerase of influenza virus in the triphosphate form. Apart from this, ribavirin could also be used in the treatment of \"Lassa fever\" (hemorrhagic fever virus infection), but ribavirin has yet not got the formal license for this medication.

Interleukins are the factors that increase the activation, development, distinction, progression, and guidance of immune cells, which can be able to nullify the virus [13] . Similarly, colony-stimulating factors regulate the proliferation and distinction of progenitor cells in the white blood cells lineage [14] . However, many of the drugs, such as ribavirin, also affect positively the immune responses [15] . Many of natural materials have been researched for their immunomodulatory activities. Carbohydrates, stilbenoids, alkaloids, polyphenols, lectins, and peptides from plant sources are the chief categories of drugs that could be used as immunomodulators.",

The entry of the virus occurs into the cell by interacting either by a single cell surface receptor or by certain coreceptors. After that, the viral envelop gets fused with host cell membrane, and as it intrudes into the cell, the virus is dismantled to release its genome. Many of the approved drugs affect this procedure of viral infection, e.g., tromantadine for the treatment of HSV infections changes the glycoproteins present on the surface of the host cells and stops the adhesion, intrusion, and uncoating of the virus. Studies on different plant-derived materials have shown the similar mechanisms for preventing viral growth, e.g., plant lectins extracted from genera Hippeastrum and Galanthus have shown the inhibition activity against the HIV-specific glycoproteins, thus resulting in inhibiting the entrance of virus into the cell. Other categories of plant materials, which includes, galactose, glucose, and N-acetylgalactosamine, have been found to contain antiviral action against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-coV) and the feline infectious peritonitis virus. These factors also inhibit the viral adhesion to the host cell. Many of natural agents also work against influenza virus receptor attaching and merging protein, i.e., hemagglutinin. In many studies, retardation of virus dismantling and emergence of genetic matter into the cell has been done by the extracts derived from various seaweeds. Heparin sulfate molecules extracted from carrageenans, seaweed, also have shown to employ antiviral activity toward dengue virus by arresting the uncoating of virus in host cells.",

It involves the metabolism of carbohydrates and allows the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and aromatic compounds such as naphthoquinones, ubiquinones, and folates. The shikimate pathway is a part of the metabolism occurred only in plants and microorganisms such as microbial eukaryotes, bacteria, and parasites. The sequence of seven-step shikimate pathway consists of transforming phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate starting with the condensation of them. Their condensation and cyclization lead to the synthesis of chorismic acid. Active forms of these with coenzyme A (CoA) can lead to the formation of phenolic compounds, which in turn by b-oxidation changes to acids of the benzoic acid series (gallic, protocatechuic, etc.). Gallic acid in combination with simple sugars transforms to the tannin compounds such as gallic and ellagic tannins and, after the addition of a molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate and additional intermediate stages, leads to the formation of aromatic amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine amino acids. The pathway includes various enzymes such as 2-keto3-deoxy-Darabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, 3-enoylpyruvylshikimate-5-phosphate synthase, shikimate dehydrogenase, shikimate kinase, 5-dehydroquinate dehydratase, and chorismate synthase. Shikimic acid is the intermediate product of this biological pathway by shikimate dehydrogenase, which facilitates the reversible transformation by reduction of 3-dehydroshikimate into shikimate. The shikimic acid pathway provides a new methodology for developing new herbicides and herbicide-resistant crops. It also provides the opportunity for engineering new antibiotic and antiparasitic drugs by interrupting the action of its enzymes. Hence, various important researches are being carried out to explore this pathway.",

The extract was then treated with water and few drops of formaldehyde solution to obtain an orange clear solution which was passed through an anion exchange column (Amberlite IRA-400, acetate form, dry weight 25 g). Shikimic acid was than eluted with acetic acid and the yellow eluent was collected, which was again heated with methanol, activated carbon and recrystallized with toluene to yield a brilliant white, crystalline substance. The modified Adams's and Payne's methods are being exploited in China for the industrial production of shikimic acid from Illicium genus plants.",

[36] have firstly isolated high purity C14-labeled shikimic acid from Ginkgo biloba L. and conducted experiments for studying the metabolism in plants, especially for studying the shikimate pathway. For this purpose, the plant was kept for metabolism in an atmosphere of radioactive carbon dioxide for several days. Extraction of the plant material was done with ethanol and water, and the impurities of the extract were removed by passing it through a Dowex 50-X4 (H\u00fe form) column. The column of Dowex 1-X8 (acetate form) was used to pass the eluate. The excellent separation of shikimic and quinic acids was achieved by gradual elution with an aqueous acetic acid, and sufficiently pure compounds were found after the final passage through the Dowex 1-X8 column. 2.12 g of shikimic acid and 0.593 g of quinic acid were yielded by 287 g of fresh leaves. G. biloba L. is known to yield shikimic acid no less than 4% based on wet leaves. During chromatographic purification, high loss of shikimic acid occurs and hence the above technique gave an extremely low yield (below 20%). A modified technique was employed by Underhill et al. [37] in which Ginkgo and rose shoots were grown with each other in a radioactive atmosphere, which yielded higher content of shikimic acid (2.5% on a dry basis of Ginkgo leaves) than in case of using Ginkgo only. These techniques are important from the perspective of research but could not be used to the industrial-level production of shikimic acid as they are multistage process and results in high product loss.",

The extracts were then passed through Amberlite IRA-400 (acetate form), and shikimic acid was eluted with 25% acetic acid, concentrated, and then crystallized from the mixed ethyl acetate and methanol. The shikimic acid was obtained of 98% purity and 70% yield depending on the original content of shikimic acid in the Liquidambar fruits leaves, which is approximately 3%e8% on a dry basis, depending on a species.

It was the firstly used orally active neuraminidase inhibitor, which serves as a competitive inhibitor for the action of the viral neuraminidase (NA) enzyme on sialic acid, present on glycoproteins found on the surface of normal host cells. By hindering the activity of the enzyme, oseltamivir stops new viral particles from being formed by infected cells. Oseltamivir is indicated for the treatment and prevention of infections due to influenza A and B viruses. In gastrointestinal tract, there is approximately 80% bioavailability of oseltamivir phosphate, which made it readily absorbed in the cells. Consequently, the oseltamivir is well distributed after ingestion as pill to the nasal mucosa, the tracheal lining, and the tissues of the middle ear. The elimination of oseltamivir carboxylate from the body follows the route for its elimination by glomerular filtration and then renal tubular excretion without undergoing further metabolism process. The estimated average half-life of elimination in adults ranges from 6 to 10 h. Influenza A and B are the two most important viruses responsible for the yearly flu seasons in human beings. They are named on the basis of major types of antigenic proteins present on the viral coating. These antigenic proteins are hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), out of which the NA is a primary target of oseltamivir and zanamivir.",

Influenza has created a global menace for the society as it has yet not developed the appropriate technology to manage the epidemic from resistant strains. Apart from the emergence of drug resistance, development of mutant strains of the virus, introduction of a more virulent strain, expensive available drugs, time lapse in vaccine manufacture, and mass mortality cause difficult problems. In this scenario, counterpart and alternate medicine offers huge possibilities to help patients. Herbs possess a wide array of biological actions and could be efficiently exploited for managing pandemic flu. Nutritional and botanical properties together are responsible for providing potent tools for controlling different types of viral infections. The accessibility of a wide array of herbs and constituents with potentially active phytochemicals, to increase the effect as antiinfluenza agents, could have an important role in the ongoing research toward the novel H1N1 infection. Shikimic acid is also found as potential antiviral source as it could be used as a precursor for industrial production of the antiviral oseltamivir or Tamiflu, a potent viral neuraminidase inhibitor. Rigorous researches for optimization of shikimic acid production and its utilization can bring a revolutionary change in antiviral therapy.",
