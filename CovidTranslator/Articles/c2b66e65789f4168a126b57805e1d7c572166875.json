A new disease with high transmissibility and mortality could emerge from an unnoticed quarter and drastically reduce the human population before sufficient resources and expertise could be marshaled. It is likely that such a new and deadly disease would have its origin in the animal world. In fact, a full 75% of emerging diseases of humans come from animals. As the human population expands, and we hop from continent to continent; as we mix various species together for trade, personal satisfaction, or to advance our technology, we are certain to move more microorganisms into novel niches, with pathogenic results.",

This review seeks to describe some of the emerging diseases of animals and their relations to the corresponding and subsequently emerging diseases in the human population.

A characteristic feature of the disease is hepatic damage, as described in the original report, ''Enzootic hepatitis or Rift Valley fever.'' RVF virus can infect a very wide host range; severe, often fatal disease has been documented in lambs, calves, goat kids, puppies, kittens, mice, and hamsters. Moderate disease has been seen in many other species [2] . The incubation period is 2 to 6 days. The virus replicates primarily in hepatocytes. Clinical signs in ruminants include weakness, anorexia, jaundice, and death. Pregnant animals will abort or give birth to malformed young. The disease is usually more severe in sheep than in cattle. Most infections in humans are asymptomatic. Those who become clinically ill most commonly experience a flu-like illness. Photophobia and symptoms of hepatic impairment may be evident. Approximately 5% of clinically ill people will develop complications, which are often grave. These include encephalitis, retinopathy, hepatorenal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation leading to massive hemorrhage. Disease in humans is almost invariably noted after mass mortality among animal species.",

This lack of ''monogamy'' with respect to vector competence ensures that RVF could easily become established in a number of areas outside its historic range. Transovarial transmission occurs, and the virus can remain in dormant eggs oviposited in dry areas. With rainfall, eggs hatch, and the resulting mosquitoes can transmit the disease. Outbreaks usually occur subsequent to climatic conditions that favor an increase in the vector population. Ruminants are considered to be amplifier hosts and can experience a significant viremia.

Likewise, construction of the Diama Dam on the Senegal River precipitated an outbreak in Mauritania in 1987. Excessive rainfall, largely brought about by the El Nin\u02dco Southern Oscillation Effect, created moist, mosquito-enhancing conditions that contributed to an outbreak in Kenya and Somalia in 1997 to 1998 [3] . In each of these instances, mass mortality in animals preceded human infections. Then, in September of 2000, the Ministries of Health in both Yemen and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia received reports about acute disease in humans that was compatible with RVF. The focus of disease was the northwestern region of Yemen and the southwestern corner of Saudi Arabia.

Seventy-seven of the 683 cases were Yemenis living and working in Saudi Arabia; the case-fatality rate for these patients was 26%.

In these areas, E multilocularis is maintained in a sylvatic cycle that involves foxes and small rodents as the definitive and intermediate hosts, respectively. While other wild canids and domestic dogs and cats can serve as alternate definitive hosts, infected humans are an aberrant or intermediate host [10] . Once ingested by humans, the egg releases an oncosphere that finds its way from the duodenum to visceral tissues, usually the liver, where the metacestode stage develops as multiple infiltrating hydatid cysts of slow but constant growth and expansion [11] . The infection is so aggressive that the lesion was initially thought to be a neoplasm.

What is the total number of potential pathogens currently present in animals? How many are capable of moving from animals to humans, or from one animal species to another? A recent paper by Dr. Sarah Cleaveland et al [18] catalogs and categorizes all known pathogens of humans, domestic livestock, and domestic carnivores based on their ability to move from one species to another. Surprisingly, of the 1415 known pathogens of humans, 61.6% have an animal origin. A total of 616 pathogens were documented for domestic livestock, with 77.3% considered ''multiple species'' (ie, capable of infecting more than one type of animal). For domestic carnivores the total was 374 pathogens, with 90% classified as ''multiple species.'' So it is apparent that there is considerable promiscuity among animal pathogens. As unusual species are grouped together, swapping of flora can easily occur.",

During the late 1950s and 1960s, six outbreaks of monkeypox were reported among captive nonhuman primates in research facilities throughout the United States [19, 20] . In four of these cases, the origin of the incriminated monkeys was not Africa but India and Southeast Asia. However, subsequent serologic surveys in wild populations in South Asia failed to identify this area as a possible niche of the virus. It is probable that these animals were exposed at some point during their transportation or quarantine process.

An outbreak of disease in pigs preceded the human clinical disease. The illness in swine was originally attributed to classical swine fever infection, but it soon became apparent that a novel infectious agent was responsible. Extensive replication in bronchiolar epithelium coupled with an exertional cough ensured that the infected pigs were spewing prolific amounts of virus into the environment. In humans, Nipah virus infection presents clinically as an acute febrile encephalitis. Nipah virus was first isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient from the Sungai Nipah village in Malaysia [36] , 6 months after its emergence in late September 1998. Close similarities of the new virus to another recently discovered paramyxovirus, Hendra virus, prompted virologists to create a new genus, Henipavirus, to include both entities. In Malaysia, the Nipah virus outbreak came to an end after the establishment of strict control measures and the culling of over a million pigs [37] . The outbreak extended to Singapore, where it was halted by ceasing the importation of pigs from Malaysia. At the end of this episode, a total of 283 human cases of viral encephalitis with 109 deaths were reported, for a fatality rate close to 40% [38] .",

Early studies were able to detect antibody titers against Nipah virus in five species of fruit bats [39] , and eventually the virus was isolated from the urine of an Island flying fox and from a partially eaten fruit regurgitated from one of these bats [40] . These findings implicated bats of the Pteropus species as the natural reservoir for Nipah virus. The critical link with the human population was made when the virus moved from fruit bats to swine. The susceptibility of swine and the marked respiratory involvement created an outbreak situation, with resulting spread to humans and a major public health crisis. The proposed chain of events that enabled this interaction began around 1997 when extensive slash-and-burn deforestation produced a haze that extended all over Southeast Asia [41] . This deforestation and haze, aggravated by an El Nin\u02dco Southern Oscillation drought, decreased the already scarce quantities of fruiting forest in the region. Impelled by these anthropogenic factors, Pteropus bats invaded areas of fruit cultivation, like the index farms, that were also used as piggeries.",

This concern is accentuated by its negative economic impact and its official listing as a critical biologic agent for public health preparedness. During the 1998 outbreak, it was demonstrated that in addition to pigs various domestic animals could serve as hosts, namely dogs, cats, and horses [42] . Also, rodents have recently been experimentally and productively infected [43] . This wide availability of potential hosts, along with the globally limited but regionally widely distributed reservoir, represents a potential threat of emergence beyond Southeast Asian boundaries. Approximately 60 species of Pteropus bats have been identified, and all are distributed in a range that extends from the islands of Mauritius, Madagascar, Pemba, and Comoro, along the sub-Himalayan region of Pakistan and India, through Southeast Asia, the Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea, and the southwest Pacific islands as far east as the Cook Islands and Australia. Although the distance these animals will travel, and thus their disease-carrying capacity, is debatable, it is recognized that the overlapping distribution of three species of flying foxes is all that is required to form a continuous link between the east coast of Australia and Pakistan [44] . This important ecological aspect must be taken into consideration during epidemiologic investigations of future emergences outside Malaysia, such as the outbreak recently (February 26, 2004) reported in Bangladesh [45] .",

However, the SARS-CoV had very little in common with any of these well-studied pathogens. There is, however, mounting evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV has a zoonotic origin. A promising lead arose when a SARS-CoV-like virus was isolated from Himalayan palm civets found in the Guangdong live-animal market, and a subsequent serosurvey study demonstrated viral titers among asymptomatic animal traders in Guangdong, suggesting previous infection with a SARS-CoV-like virus [49, 50] .",

As was articulated in a recent National Academies of Science report, myriad factors in our interconnected global village are creating the microbial equivalent of a ''perfect storm'' [53] . However, unlike a major climatic event, where various meteorologic forces converge to produce a tempest, this microbial perfect storm will not subside.
