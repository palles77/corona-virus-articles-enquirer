As to March 17,  2020, a total of 81118 patients in China were diagnosed as confirmed COVID-19, and 68802 patients have been cured and discharged [5] . At the same time, the number of suspected cases has also decreased significantly. It shows China's epidemic prevention policy has achieved initial results. However, the infection has spread over 48 countries worldwide, especially in Iran, Korea and some European countries, even affected the United States. The global risk of this epidemic was escalated to highest level by WHO on February 28. Fast and effective diagnostics methods of this disease is of great importance at present.",

Its limited production and relatively long testing period might not be conducive for screening. Accumulated clinical experience suggests that early chest computed tomography might be helpful in differential diagnosis of suspected cases. Recently, Chung, Fang and Kanne etc. had reported the chest CT imaging features of COVID19 [8] [9] [10] . Fang and Ai further studied the sensitivity of Chest CT compared to RT-PCR with relatively small sample [9, 11] . However, there is no agreed standard for how to confirm a COVID-19 patient with these features. We retrospectively collected chest CT images of suspected pneumonia patients and divided them though RT-PCR test into positive and negative group, then compared the difference of CT features between two groups. Our purpose is to use statistics methods to distinguish the imaging features of COVID-19 with other chest infectious diseases and evaluate diagnostic value of chest CT for suspected patients.",

The average specificity of all combinations is around 90%, and the combination of GGO with crazy-paving pattern and bilateral pulmonary distribution was the highest at 99% when three items combined. Even all reached to 99% for four items. Conclusion comes out that the combinations of GGO with different features in chest CT might significantly increase the specificity in diagnosis of COVID-19. It means in series of crazy-paving pattern, air bronchogram, bilateral lower pulmonary distribution, bilateral lower pulmonary distribution and pleural distribution, as long as they appear simultaneously with GGO on chest CT, COVID-19 should be highly suspected, even if the patient had repeatedly negative RT-PCR outcomes. This might help emergency physicians identify COVID-19 patients faster and more effectively. Based on accumulated experience, we recommend these patients to be quarantined and repeat the RT-PCR tests until the average incubation ends, especially in the areas with severe outbreaks. Worth noting that, COVID-19 is currently in the period of outbreak and as is still the season of all kinds of influenzas. Epidemiological exposure, RT-PCR test and chest CT scan are equally critical to diagnosis. All rights reserved.

First, the method is to compare the difference of CT imaging features between confirmed patients and non-confirmed patients of COVID-19. Some early lesions might not be visible on chest CT since the maximum incubation period is 14 days or even more [6] . So the expression of time may not be precise enough according to the development of this disease. Second, the current gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is merely RT-PCR test [6] . Since the test samples are mostly pharynx swabs rather than bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), it might still present false negative results after repetitions.",
