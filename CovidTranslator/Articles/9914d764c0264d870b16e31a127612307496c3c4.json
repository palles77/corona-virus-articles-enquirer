Despite sustained efforts, the disease is still endemic, with high mortality and morbidity. New antiviral strategies to control PRRSV are needed. Griffithsin, a red algal lectin, has potent antiviral effect on several human enveloped viruses, but this effect has not been demonstrated on PRRSV. Here, we first tested the in vitro antiviral activity of Griffithsin against PRRSV. Griffithsin exerted strong saccharide-dependent antiviral activity against PRRSV, probably through interactions with glycans on the surface of PRRSV that interfered with virus entry. Furthermore we revealed that Griffithsin's action on PRRSV involved blocking viral adsorption, and it had no effect on viral penetration. Besides Our findings also suggested that Griffithsin may interfere with cell-to-cell spread to prevent virus transmission. The remarkable potency profile of Griffithsin supports its potential value as an antiviral agent against PRRSV.",

Moreover, PRRSV infection confers susceptibility to secondary infection by other viruses or bacteria. Vaccination is the most common prophylactic measure used to protect pigs against PRRSV infection. Currently, modified live virus (MLV) PRRSV vaccines are considered most effective although probably because of PRRSV genetic variation, MLV vaccines have failed to confer complete protection against drift variants [3, 4] .

Millet and colleagues performed detailed studies to define the viral life cycle stage at which Griffithsin acted and found that Griffithsin inhibited MERS-CoV by acting on the adsorption stage [9] . By contrast, Griffithsin exhibited its antiviral activity against HSV-2 by preventing cell-to-cell spread, but had little effect on HSV-2 entry into target cells [33] . The reason for this difference may be related to the virus itself and its entry receptors. Further studies are needed to clarify the anti-PRRSV activity of Griffithsin in porcine alveolar macrophages, the main targets of PRRSV infection in vivo.",

Taking our own findings and the results of previous studies together, we inferred that the binding of Griffithsin to PRRSV glycoproteins prevented PRRSV attachment to target cells, possibly due to steric hindrance or loss of PRRSV receptor-binding ability. Previous studies revealed that Griffithsin reduced HIV, HCV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and JEV infectivity through binding to viral glycoproteins, thereby blocking viral entry. It was also confirmed that Griffithsin could bind to glycoprotein of HSV-2 and inhibited viral transmission by blocking cell-to-cell spread. Interestingly, Griffithsin also has antiviral activity against HPV, a non-enveloped virus, by binding to the secondary receptor \u03b16 integrin and decreasing its availability on the cell surface [7] . Due to the uncertain nature of the interactions between Griffithsin, PRRSV and host cells, its mode of action should be clarified in future studies.",
