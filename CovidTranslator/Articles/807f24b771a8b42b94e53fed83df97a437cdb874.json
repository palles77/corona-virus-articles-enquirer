            "text": "We investigated the aberrant expression of plasma proteins in patients with pancreatic cancer. High-abundance plasma proteins (albumin, transferrin, haptoglobin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, IgG and IgA) were depleted by use of an immuno-affinity column, and low-abundance ones were separated into five fractions by anion-exchange chromatography. The fractionated plasma proteins were subjected to 2D-DIGE with highly sensitive fluorescent dyes. The quantitative protein expression profiles obtained by 2D-DIGE were compared between two plasma protein mixtures: one from five non-cancer bearing healthy donors and the other from five patients with pancreatic cancer. Among 1200 protein spots, we found that 33 protein spots were differently expressed between the two mixtures; 27 of these were up-regulated and six were down-regulated in cancer. Mass spectrometry and database searching allowed the identification of the proteins corresponding to the gel spots. Up-regulation of leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein (LRG), which has not previously been implicated in pancreatic cancer, was observed. Western blotting with an anti-LRG antibody validated the up-regulation of LRG in an independent series of plasma samples from healthy controls, patients with chronic pancreatitis, and patients with pancreatic cancer. Our results demonstrate the application of a combination of multi-dimensional liquid chromatography with 2D-DIGE for plasma proteomics and suggest the clinical utility of LRG plasma level measurement.",

Because of a lack of specific symptoms in the early stages, the limitations of diagnostic methods, and the lack of response to all present treatments, the mortality rate of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the highest among all cancer types. Indeed, each year pancreatic adenocarcinoma causes >21,000 deaths in Japan and >31,000 in the United States [1, 2] . As the majority of patients with pancreatic cancer have locally advanced disease or distant metastases at the time of diagnosis, most cases are surgically inoperable. In contrast, the 5-year survival rate of patients who undergo resection reaches 13.0% [3] . Therefore, early diagnosis at a potentially resectable stage will improve patient survival.",

Although extensive efforts have been focused on finding candidates for plasma tumor markers and many candidates have been listed, none of them has yet proven to be clinically useful. The most widely used marker for pancreatic cancer, CA19-9, is often elevated in benign cholangitis and pancreatitis and therefore lacks the specificity needed to detect potentially curable lesions [4] [5] [6] [7] . Therefore, to discover practical plasma tumor markers for pancreatic cancer that lead to better prognosis, novel technologies are required to quantify low-abundance plasma proteins in a large sample set.",

Although far from comprehensive, these approaches have successfully created catalogs of plasma proteins [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] and identified candidate tumor markers for pancreatic cancer [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Nevertheless, validation of these candidate tumor markers is not yet complete and their real potential to benefit patients is still unknown. In addition, because existing proteomics technologies are not fully developed for cancer plasma proteomics in terms of tumor marker discovery, it is likely that more candidate markers are present in plasma. Thus, in addition to validating the present candidate tumor markers, we need to continue improving the existing proteomic methods and applying them to tumor marker development.",

In 2D-DIGE, proteins are labeled with fluorescent dyes prior to 2D-PAGE [22] . By loading an internal common standard sample labeled with a different fluorescent dye, gelto-gel variations are cancelled out and quantitative proteomic profiling can be achieved across multiple samples [23] . However, 2D-DIGE does not reveal most of the plasma proteome because of the particular shortcomings of 2D-PAGE, including the limited amount of protein that can be loaded onto a gel, the small gel area available to separate protein spots, and the low sensitivity of fluorescent dyes. These problems can be addressed by modifying or combining existing proteomic technologies. To this end, we have established a new 2D-DIGE method for plasma proteomics in which high-abundance plasma proteins are depleted on an immuno-affinity column and the low-abundance proteins are fractionated by anion-exchange column prior to 2D-DIGE [24] . In our previous report, we applied this protocol to the successful identification of plasma proteins aberrantly expressed in lung cancer patients [24] . In the present paper, we use this protocol to examine the plasma proteome of pancreatic cancer and identify candidate plasma tumor markers.",

A plasma sample (150 l) was diluted with 600 l of Buffer A (Agilent Technologies) and filtered with a 0.22 m spin filter (Agilent Technologies) by centrifugation at 16,000 \u00d7 g for 1 min. A portion (150 l) of the diluted sample was applied to the immuno-affinity column and eluted with Buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 10 min. The proteins trapped by the immuno-affinity column were eluted with Buffer B (Agilent Technologies) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min for 10 min. This process was repeated 5 times. The column was re-equilibrated for further experiments with Buffer A at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min for 12 min.

A small number of targeted proteins bound to the immuno-affinity column were observed in the fractions from the anion-exchange column (data not shown). We excluded these proteins from differential analysis by 2D-DIGE because we did not identify the mechanisms by which they leaked through the immuno-affinity column. DeCyder software selected 33 protein spots that showed a more than 2-fold difference in intensity between the two mixtures with statistical significance (Student's t-test, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3) . These differences were not observed when we compared 2D profiles of whole plasma ( Fig. 2A) . In the flow-through fraction of the anion-exchange chromatography, the amount of protein was too small to allow statistical analysis of the protein spots. Of the 33 protein spots, the intensity of 27 spots was up-regulated and that of 6 spots was down-regulated in pancreatic cancer, and these spots were subjected to protein identification by mass spectrometry (Table 4 ). Of the 33 protein spots, we identified multiple proteins in eight single spots. In spots 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17, the amino acid coverage was different between the candidate proteins by a factor of approximately 2. However, mass spectrometric study on spot 26 resulted in the identification of three candidates, of which two had an almost equal number of identified peptides, Mascot score and coverage rate; tentatively considering the proteins with the highest peptide number, the highest Mascot score and the highest coverage rate as the most probable candidates for the proteins corresponding to the spots, the number of proteins corresponding to the 33 protein spots increased to 10. Of these 10 proteins, 8 corresponded to 31 spots, probably reflecting posttranslational modifications. Of these 8 proteins, 7 proteins corresponding to 28 spots, showed consistent up-or down-regulation. In contrast, the spots containing complement C4 showed inconsistent regulation; the intensity of two spots was increased while that of one spot was decreased in pancreatic cancer samples. ",

The primary structure of LRG suggests that it may be a membrane-associated or membrane-derived protein [26] . Although LRG is correlated with granulocytic differentiation [27] and is involved in the TGF-beta 1 pathway [28] , the biological functions and the site of origin of LRG are still obscure. Aberrant regulation of LRG has been observed in patients with malignant disease and with virus infection [24, 29] . We have previously reported elevated plasma levels of LRG in lung cancer by using a proteomic protocol similar to that used in the present study [24] . Recently, Yu et al. performed a plasma proteomic study on pancreatic cancer by using a combination of immuno-affinity column and 2D-DIGE [30] . Although they applied less stringent criteria than ours to detect differentially expressed plasma proteins (statistical and fold differences were not considered), up-regulation of LRG in pancreatic cancer was not detected in their study. These observations suggest that anion-exchange chromatography may be critically important to improve the performance of 2D-PAGE. LRG was not identified in several expression studies on cellular proteins in pancreatic cancer that used various modalities, including 2D-PAGE and mass spectrometry [31, 32] . Neither did a comprehensive proteomic study on the proteins secreted from tissue-cultured pancreatic cancer cells that used the stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) method result in the identification of LRG [33] . Thus, plasma LRG may not originate in pancreatic cancer cells. In an early 2D-PAGE study on plasma proteins, plasma LRG was found to be increased during bacterial and viral infections [34] .

Although extensive proteomic studies with parallel use of 2D-DIGE linked to ESI-MS/MS and isotope-coded affinity tag technology (ICAT) coupled with two-dimensional LC-MS/MS listed many proteins associated with infection by SARS-CoV, elevated LRG was not observed in the infected cells [37] . These observations suggest that an increased concentration of plasma LRG may be due to a host response to certain types of malignant disease and virus infection.",

            "text": "We examined the plasma LRG expression levels of cancer patients who were not in the acute inflammatory phase. First, we selected cancer patients with normal C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration ( Table 2 , P6-10) to explore whether the increase in LRG levels paralleled the dynamics of the common acute phase proteins. Second, we tested plasma from cancer patients with a normal level of CA19-9 (Table 2, P6 and P8), a tumor marker commonly used for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, to examine the possibility of plasma LRG levels being using in a way complementary to existing tumor markers. SDS-PAGE/Western blotting using an anti-LRG antibody showed consistent up-regulation of LRG in these patients, who were negative for CRP and/or CA19-9, compared with the noncancer bearing healthy donors (Fig. 4F) . Therefore, increased amounts of LRG may be independent of the regulation of other acute phase proteins and tumor markers. We also examined plasma samples from chronic pancreatitis patients (Table 3 ) and found that they tended to express lower LRG levels compared with the samples from pancreatic cancer patients (Fig. 5) . By correlating the expression levels of LRG with clinical information from a large sample set, we hope to validate the utility of LRG as a biomarker to monitor the status of patients. Some plasma samples from pancreatic cancer patients did not express high LRG levels, leading us to suggest that the examination of plasma LRG levels in combination with the existing biomarkers would increase the specificity and sensitivity of the diagnosis. Kawakami et al. reported increased amounts of plasma LRG in liver cancer patients treated with radiofrequency ablation [38] . Thus, the possible application of plasma LRG to monitor the effect of treatment may also be worth examining in pancreatic cancer.",

First, similar to our previous report [24] , targeted proteins were observed in the fractions from the anion-exchange column. Possible reasons for the leak include the specificity of the antibodies, the capacity of the column and the presence of unknown substances hindering the binding of some population of the targeted proteins. While it was difficult to determine whether this event was due to technical reasons or was a true Fig. 5 . LRG levels of plasma samples from validation set 2 examined by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting with an anti-LRG antibody. N11-N15: samples from non-cancer bearing healthy donors; PT1-PT4: samples from chronic pancreatitis patients; P11-P18: samples from pancreatic cancer patients. Following the ECL reaction, the membrane was stripped and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) (A). The ECL signals for the LRG proteins were normalized to the intensity of the CBB-stained membrane, and the relative LRG signal was calculated (B). N: non-cancer bearing healthy donors, PT: chronic pancreatitis patients, P: pancreatic cancer patients. Gray rhombuses indicate individual data. Black circles and bars indicate data average and standard error for each group, respectively. Comparisons between means were performed using Student's t-test; there were no significant differences. event that had biological meaning, we compared the six targeted proteins between the non-cancer bearing healthy donors and the cancer patients by use of un-fractionated plasma samples with the same 2D-DIGE method, and no significant differences were observed. Second, the immuno-affinity method may be concomitantly removing low-abundance proteins bound to carrier proteins such as albumin and immunoglobulins [39] . We could not analyze these low-abundance proteins in this report, but special attention to these proteins may be required in further plasma proteomic studies.",

These overlapping spots were expressed across fractions because they had different features which were revealed by the anion-exchange column. We considered these overlapping spots to correspond to different isoforms of the same protein, and have therefore counted all protein spots on the 2D-PAGE gels. However, not every differentially expressed protein was considered to be a suitable tumor marker; for example, spots 8 and 11 (transthyretin) were differentially expressed between cancer patients and healthy donors, but they were very minute amounts of the total abundant transthyretin, and it was difficult to extract these portion of the protein. On the contrary, LRG, which was also differentially expressed between cancer patients and healthy donors, was only expressed in one fraction and was therefore selected as a candidate for a tumor marker of pancreatic cancer.",

The use of high-resolution 2D-PAGE with narrow-range IPG gels and large-format second dimension gels could solve this problem to some extent. However, in cases where multiple proteins are listed as candidates as a result of mass spectrometric protein identification, the differential expression of the candidate proteins should be confirmed by 2D-PAGE/Western blotting before initiating experiments relying on the results of the 2D-PAGE study (Figs. 4 and 5) .",
