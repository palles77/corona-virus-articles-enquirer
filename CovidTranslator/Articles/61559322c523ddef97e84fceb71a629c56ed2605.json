Analytical results are obtained using the respective ratios of susceptible, exposed (incubating), and asymptomatic classes to the clinical symptomatic infective class. Conditions are given for bistability of equilibria to occur, where trajectories with distinct initial values could result in either a major outbreak where the disease spreads to the whole population or a lesser outbreak where some members of the population remain uninfected. This dynamic behavior did not arise in a SARS model without asymptomatic infective class studied by Hsu and Hsieh (SIAM J. Appl. Math. 66(2), 2006). Hence, this illustrates that depending on the initial states, control of a disease outbreak with asymptomatic infections may involve more than simply reducing the reproduction number. Moreover, the presence of asymptomatic infections could result in either a positive or negative impact on the outbreak, depending on different sets of conditions on the parameters, as illustrated with numerical simulations. Biological interpretations of the analytical and numerical results are also given.",

Many of the studies have focused on intervention measures with vaccine or antiviral drug prophylaxis to contain a pandemic outbreak (Longini et al., 2004 (Longini et al., , 2005 Ferguson et al., 2005) or on mitigating strategies to alleviate the severity of a global public health catastrophe (Germann et al., 2006; Ferguson et al., 2006) . In some of these studies, namely, Longini et al. (2004 Longini et al. ( , 2005 and Germann et al. (2006) , the proposed models include 2 classes of infective persons, one is the symptomatic infectives with clinical symptoms and the other is the asymptomatic infectives with no or minor (subclinical) symptoms. The impact of asymptomatic cases on the severity of outbreak was explored using simulation studies. Stilianakis et al. (1998) first proposed to include the asymptomatic infectives in a standard SARS model to study treatment and chemoprophylaxis strategies and their effects on the spread of the infection. However, to our best knowledge, the role of asymptomatic infection on the overall transmission dynamics of influenza was never analytically explored.",

            "text": "It is widely believed that asymptomatic cases and asymptomatic infection of influenza, as well as, H5N1 do indeed occur regularly (e.g., Chan, 2002; Graat et al., 2003; Bell et al., 2006) . Several earlier studies have indicated that subclinical infections account for about one-third of infections (Nafta et al., 1970; Oker-Blom et al., 1970; Monto et al., 1979; Pettersson et al., 1980; Quarles et al., 1981) . Nonetheless, skepticism regarding asymptomatic spread of flu remains; some studies have suggested that virus shedding may sometimes occur before clinically significant symptoms or during subclinical symptoms, but virus shedding detected by nasal swabs cannot be equated to transmission of infection (Eccles, 2005) . By its nature, asymptomatic or subclinical flu cases are difficult to diagnose. Hence, it is impossible to precisely define the number of asymptomatic cases, not to mention the demanding task of tracing the number of infections by those asymptomatic cases. Consequently, clinical evidence of asymptomatic infection is extremely scarce and the magnitude of its contribution to spread of flu is hard to ascertain. In Longini et al. (2004) , it was assumed that the probability that a person will be symptomatic given that person has been infected is 0.67, based on population-level influenza cohort studies in the US. Moreover, they assumed that an asymptomatic infection is only 50% as infectious as a symptomatic infection. Intuitively, there might be a substantial (but poorly understood and inadequately quantified) difference in the respective transmission probabilities from asymptomatic person and symptomatic person to susceptible persons. Clearly, an infected person with clinical illness sheds more virus than does one with subclinical symptoms and also has illness manifestations (e.g., coughing) that contribute to the generation of infectious aerosols. On the other hand, infected persons with clinical symptoms may show reduced contacts if they are sufficiently ill to be confined to bed. For a lucid discussion, the readers are referred to Stilianakis et al. (1998) .",

            "text": "The above-mentioned modeling studies with an asymptomatic infective class utilize complicated models and simulation studies to explore the role of asymptomatic infection in intervention strategies. It has been suggested that if a substantial proportion of disease transmission occurs through asymptomatic infection, the population impact of intervention measures such as health screening and case-patient isolation will be severely diminished (Bell et al., 2006) . Moreover, a simulation study shows that, using 2003 Taiwan SARS outbreak as the hypothetical setting, if SARS patients in Taiwan had been infectious during incubation for a mere 2 days before onset of clinical symptoms, the number of cases would increase substantially (G. Webb et al., unpublished work) . A recent study of an epidemic model which considers asymptomatic infection (Arino et al., 2006) suggested that many of the simulation results of the complicated simulation models can also be obtained from simple classical deterministic compartmental models. Therefore, in this work, we will make use of a simple compartmental model to study analytically the role of asymptomatic infection on the transmission dynamics of influenza, by assuming that an asymptomatic infective is only half as infectious as a clinically ill infective. Similar to Stilianakis et al. (1998) , we do not consider infections by flu patients during incubation. Moreover, we purposely do not consider interventions, for this direction of research could be carried out in future studies using more complicated models and computer simulations, if needed.",

Biologically, it demonstrates the possibility that even if the basic reproduction number is lower than 1, the disease could still persist in the community given appropriate parameter values and hypothetical initial population sizes. Moreover, in both cases where bistability occurs, we can conjecture the existence of an interior equilibrium which is a saddle point with a 2-dimensional stable manifold, although we are unable to prove it.

To do so, we note that E 0 is stable if\u03b2 > \u03b4 2 + \u03b3 2 , E 23 is stable if\u03b2 > B = g(\u03b1) and E \u221e is stable if\u03b2 < C = h(\u03b1). Moreover, g(\u03b1) and h(\u03b1) satisfy the following: if 0 < \u03b4 < \u03b3 3 \u03b4 2 +\u03b3 2 , then g (\u03b1) < 0 and h (\u03b1) < 0, and if \u03b4 > \u03b3 3 \u03b4 2 +\u03b3 2 , then g (\u03b1) > 0, and h (\u03b1) > 0. We note that when \u03b1 = 1, g(1) = h(1) = \u03c3 2 + \u03b3 2 , and we have the case of no asymptomatic infection; when \u03b1 = 0, g(0) = h(0) = \u03b3 3 /\u03b4, and we have the extreme case of every infective is asymptomatic with reduced infectivity \u03b4. Moreover, the presence of asymptomatic cases (1 \u2212 \u03b1 differing from 0) represents a decrease in \u03b1 from 1. Subsequently, for Case 1 in Section 4, we have h (\u03b1) < 0, and hence, \u03c3 2 + \u03b3 2 = h(1) < C = h(\u03b1); that is, the stability region of E \u221e becomes larger due to presence of asymptomatic cases (Fig. 2) , and for a given range of values of \u03b2 and depending on the initial states, the presence of asymptomatic cases could keep some individuals uninfected when they would have been infected otherwise. For Case 2 in Section 4, we have g(1) = h(1) = \u03c3 2 + \u03b3 2 < B = g(\u03b1) < C = h(\u03b1). Clearly, both the bistability region and the stability region of E \u221e becomes larger due to presence of asymptomatic cases, or \u03b1 decreasing (see Fig. 4) . Therefore, the impact of asymptomatic infection could again be beneficial, for a range of values of\u03b2. For Case 3, Subcase 1-(i), we have 0 < B = g(\u03b1) < C = h(\u03b1) < g(1) = h(1) = \u03c3 2 + \u03b3 2 . In this case, the asymptomatic population has a negative effect on the stability region of E \u221e , since we have the condition of \u03b4 > \u03b3 3 /(\u03b4 2 + \u03b3 2 ) (see Fig. 5 .1). For Case 3, Subcase 1-(ii), 0 < g(1) = h(1) = \u03c3 2 + \u03b3 2 < C = h(\u03b1) < B = g(\u03b1), and we have the same situation as Case 2 (Fig. 5.2) . Case 3, Subcase 2 (Fig. 6) and Case 4 (Fig. 7) are similar to Case 1.",

Therefore, the condition for positive impact of asymptomatic infections to occur, \u03c3 2 + \u03b3 2 < C, is equivalent to the inequality c\u03b2/C = c\u03b2\u03b1/(\u03c3 2 + \u03b3 2 ) + c\u03b2\u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03b1)/\u03b3 3 < c\u03b2/(\u03c3 2 + \u03b3 2 ). The last term of this inequality is the infection rate per infective times the duration in the infective class, which is roughly the average number of infections by an infective, if there is no asymptomatic infection. The term on the left-hand side of the inequality is the average of the number of infections by an infective when there is asymptomatic infections, i.e., the number of infections by an symptomatic infective (I) times the probability that the person is symptomatic plus the number of infections by an asymptomatic infective (A) times the probability that the person is asymptomatic. It is intuitive that if the presence of asymptomatic infectives leads to a reduction in the average number of infections by an infective individual, then it is beneficial. Conversely, similar observation can be made for the case of negative impact, i.e., C < \u03c3 2 + \u03b3 2 , where the condition implies that the presence of asymptomatic infectives leads to an increase in the average number of infections by an infective individual, and hence, has a negative effect on the outbreak.

In the original (S, E, I, A, H, R)-system, they represent the same equilibrium (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, R \u221e ) (see Theorem 1). Biologically, these distinct equilibria in W 1 W 2 W 3 -space signify the different ratio with which the trajectories could approach (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, R \u221e ) in (S, E, I, A, H, R)space.

Since\u03b2 is the adjusted infection rate due to public response as quantified by a. We can, therefore, conclude that public response only serves to lower the magnitude of infections, as roughly measured by\u03b2, but does not affect the basic dynamics of the system, as opposed to quarantine which could bring about bistability, as demonstrated in Hsu and Hsieh (2006) .",

Another direction for further exposition is adding spatial spread, perhaps in a multipatch framework (Hsieh et al., 2007) . Clearly, adding those factors would make the analysis decidedly more challenging, but is a worthwhile topic for future studies. Another open problem for future work is to explore whether the role of asymptomatic infection also depends on the standard incidence term we have used in this work, which can be accomplished perhaps by using a more general expression for disease incidence (e.g., Hsieh et al., 2007) .",

Comparing the behavior of the solutions of systems (1) and (2), we know that when S \u221e = 0, the behavior of the solutions for the two systems are exactly the same. On the other hand, when S \u221e > 0, they are different but positive for both systems, albeit with different values. It is reasonable since the final size of the solution S(t) depends only on the initial population S 0 , I 0 and A 0 . However, we note that, in all numerical examples given, system (1) is used for the simulations, and hence, all numerical results, including the minimum threshold asymptomatic fractions (1 \u2212 \u03b1) obtained from Figs. 9.2 and 10.2, are that of the original system (1).",
