Methods Nasopharyngeal aspirate and throat swabs were collected and processed for extraction of nucleic acid using automated extraction system and real time RT-PCR was performed using primers and probes specific to HPIV 1-4 and other respiratory viruses on 743 samples. Results Total positivity for Parainfluenza viruses 1-4 was found to be 69/743 (9.28 %), of which 50/533 (9.38 %) were boys and 19/210 (9.05 %) girls. Predominance of HPIV-3 was observed [41/743 (5.52%)] followed by HPIV-1 in 13/743 (1.75%), HPIV-4 in 10/743 (1.34%) and HPIV-2 in 5/743 (0.67%) patients. Maximum positivity was observed in age group 25-36 mo (12.98%) followed by 13-24 mo group (11.96%). HPIVs were found to be circulating round the year and each year. Co-infections with other respiratory viruses were observed in 22/69 (31.88%) of HPIV positive patients. Conclusions All the four types of HPIV were found to be circulating in the index population during all the three years, predominantly during post monsoon and winter seasons. HPIV vaccination should be targeted for all types.",

In the United States approximately five million LRTIs occur each year in children <5 y of age and HPIVs are isolated in up to one-third of these infections. HPIVs are of four types (HPIV 1-4). HPIV1-3 are important cause of respiratory infections in infants and children and are only second to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a cause of hospitalisation for acute respiratory infections among children <5 y of age. While HPIV-4 has been reported in few studies only and the lack of epidemiological data prevents clear understanding of the complete picture. The clinical presentations of HPIV types are also not well known [1] [2] [3] [4] .",

Study from China also reported predominance of HPIV-3 followed by HPIV-1 but lower for HPIV-4 [1] . Predominance of HPIV-3 has also been reported by other studies from India, [18] United States [19] and China [16, 20] . HPIVs were found to be circulating in all the three years of the present study. HPIV 3 was present throughout the year while HPIV 1 and 2 were positive post monsoon and in winters and HPIV 4 only in winters. Whereas a study from Delhi reported HPIVs only in the first year in a study of 2 y [18] and Fry et al. from USA reported biennial activity of HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 [21] . Competitive interaction between HPIV-3 and HPIV-1 has been reported by a study from USA [21] but, same was not observed in index study. Studies based on detection of HPIV-4 are very few; as a result seasonal variation is not well known [1, 21] and only 1.34% positivity was observed in the present study for HPIV-4, with peak activity in winters. Different geographical locations and climatic factors may influence the circulating patterns of different HPIVs. Ambient climatic conditions like temperature and humidity may favour the propagation of particular HPIV type at a particular time which may vary in different places [2] . Malnutrition, overcrowding, vitamin A deficiency and improper breast feeding have also been reported to predispose to HPIV infections [2] . HPIV infections may occur throughout the life since immunity to the virus is incomplete, however low or nil positivity has been reported in 1st mo of life due to maternal antibodies, highest positivity was observed in children of 13-48 mo in the index study as reported earlier too [2] .",

All the four HPIVs positive patients presented with similar spectrum of signs and symptoms making it difficult to correlate the HPIV type with a particular sign and symptom as reported earlier also [1, 20] ; but this could be due to the fact that only hospitalised patients were included in the index study where difference in severity may not be appreciable. However, none of the index HPIV positive patients presented with bronchiolitis which is an important serious manifestation of LRTI [2] ; however, this could be due to the fact that bronchiolitis was observed in very few patients enrolled in the present study. According to Wang et al. [22] and Stankowa et al. [23] , more severe respiratory illnesses were caused by HPIV-3 than by types 1 and 2, whereas, no significant differences in the severity of the illnesses among different HPIV types was reported from Taipei [16] .",
