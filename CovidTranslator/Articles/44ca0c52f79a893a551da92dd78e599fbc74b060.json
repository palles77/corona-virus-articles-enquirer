Mutated DNA was transfected into B lymphoma cells that were then selected by neomycin resistance and for their ability to express I-A k molecules on their plasma membrane. The translational diffusion coefficient (Dtat) of I-A k molecules composed of a wild-type/3 chain paired with an ot chain missing either 6 or 12 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain is on the average threefold higher than the D,,, of wild-type I-A k molecules as measured by fluorescence photobleaching and recovery. The removal of 12 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain of the/3 chain did not change the D~a~ value from that of wild-type I-A k if the truncated/3 chain was paired with a wild-type c~ chain. Removing all amino acids of the cytoplasmic domains of both the ot and/3 chains resulted in a 10-fold increase in the Dtat, the highest value for any of the truncated I-A k molecules tested. These data indicate that the carboxy-terminal six amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of the et chain and the six plasma membrane-proximal amino acids of the/3 chain are important in constraining the translational diffusion of I-A k molecules in the plasma membrane.",

            "text": "T HE cytoplasmic domains of a number of transmembrane membrane proteins are thought to be important in the membrane biology of those proteins (3, 13, (16) (17) (18) 31) . Plasma membrane proteins with truncated cytoplasmic domains may not be correctly sorted or internalized and may lose signaling functions (22) (23) (24) 26) . Surprisingly, the translational diffusion coefficient (D,.t)' of proteins with such truncations is not found to differ from that of full-length molecules. Dj., of the EGF receptor (16) , class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen (10) , or G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (25) is not changed when the cytoplasmic domains of these molecules are truncated by directed mutation of their genes. At the extreme, this involves a reduction from 542 to 9 residues in the EGF receptor (16) . These studies imply that the amino acids removed are not associated with cytoplasmic proteins in ways that constrain their translational diffusion. There is an apparent contradiction between the results on the cell physiology of truncated molecules and the measurements of their translational diffusion. Results of endocytosis experiments indicate that the molecules are coupled to the cell cytoskeleton and that this coupling is lost with truncation since internalization is affected by truncation. On the other hand, the results of translational diffusion experiments suggest that even wild-type, 1. Abbreviations used in this paper: D0~t, translational diffusion coefficient; FPR, fluorescence photobleachin 8 and recovery; MCF, mean channel fluorescence; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PKC, protein kinase C. full-length molecules are not directly linked to the cytoskeleton since truncation of their cytoplasmic domains has no effect on D,.,. This contradiction may arise largely because translational diffusion and endocytosis of truncated molecules have been studied in different cell types. D~ of the truncated class I MHC mutants has been measured in L cells, in which class I molecules are not rapidly internalized. The effect of truncation on endocytosis of the same mutants is readily shown when they are expressed in T lymphoma cells, a cell type in which there is continuous cycling of class I MHC antigens between the surface and cytoplasm (4) . Similarly, D,,, of truncated EGF receptor was measured in COS cells, while effects of truncation on endocytosis of EGF receptor were shown in 3T3 cells (2) . Here we present the first results in which D,a, of truncated transmembrane molecules is measured in cells in which the wild-type molecules are functional. Truncation of the cytoplasmic domain affects D,a, in these cells; in the extreme truncation mutant, the D,,, is an order of magnitude larger than that of the wild-type molecule.",

Ia molecules also function as receptors that influence the differentiative or proliferative events in B lymphocytes (6, 7) . Potentially, Ia molecules are coupled to the molecules of the signal-transducing cascade through the highly conserved amino acids of the transmembrane domain or cytoplasmic domain (12) . Ia molecules and surface Ig (which also provides signals to B cells) are similar in their ability to associate with insoluble cytoskeletal elements after receptor cross-linking and to remain associated with the cytoskeleton during solubilization of the cells (30) .

The recovery curve contains information about the Dlat of the mAbbound molecules and about the fraction, R, of the population of mAb-bound molecules that are free to diffuse, on a time scale of minutes, in the experiment. Dl,t of a given molecule is a function of the radius of the diffusing species. Hence, monovalent labels-i.e., Fab fragments (which do not cross-link bound molecules)-give more reliable estimates of Dlat than do larger and bivalent IgG labels. The mobile fraction, R, is influenced by the intensity and specificity of binding of the Fab, as well as by the biology of the ceils. Calculations and control experiments indicate that the measuring and bleaching beams do not cause detectable cross-linking of, or damage to, the low concentrations of molecules of interest in an FPR experiment (9) .",

The fact that in these molecules PKC signaling is still intact indicates that D~, may increase threefold without the I-A k molecule uncoupling from the signal transduction pathway. There are a number of possible explanations for this observation. One possibility is that the interaction between the Ia molecule and the molecule(s) of the signaling pathway is transient and is mediated almost exclusively by the/3 chain. Thus, the requisite interaction can occur with normal kinetics in spite of the fact that the Ia molecule is diffusing threefold more rapidly. Additionally, truncation of the /3 chain in aCT12//3CTI8 I-A k molecules removes the six plasma membrane-proximal amino acids of the ~ chain that are required for constitutive binding of the proteins of the Ia-mediated signaling cascade. This binding contributes to the wild-type D~a,, and therefore the loss of the binding results in an increase in Dja~ as well as in inability to translocate PKC. In our view, lateral diffusion of I-A k reflects two independent interactions: one in which the a chain interacts with cytoskeletal elements that are not necessary for PKC translocation and one in which the /3 chain interacts with molecules that are required for PKC translocation.",

Freed, unpublished observations) indicate that antigen presentation by I-A k molecules is affected by the length of the et chain cytoplasmic domain. A published report also indicates that antigen presentation is affected by truncation of the ct chain's cytoplasmic domain (13) . While the mechanism underlying these observations is unknown, it is tempting to speculate that there is a causal relationship between the increased D~, for I-A ~ molecules with truncated et chains and their reduced ability to present antigen. Although it is possible that the increased mobility of the I-A k molecules with truncated c~ chains could be directly responsible for this effect, we currently favor the alternate hypothesis that the antigen presentation defect derives from the altered transport, endocytosis, and/or reexpression of I-A k molecules with truncated t~ chains.",

The observed differences between the behavior of truncated class I and class II molecules may be explained by the fact that the class I molecule has a single membrane domain whereas the class II molecule has two. An alternate, and not mutually exclusive, explanation may be that class I molecules may not have a signaling function in the L cells in which they were studied and thus are not associated with cytoskeletal elements (4) . Additional studies will be required to provide a detailed explanation for the observed differences between the D,~, of truncated class I and class II molecules. Ultimately, however, studies of their diffusion should provide fundamental insights into how the physicochemical properties of the class II molecules dictate their function as signal-transducing membrane receptors.",
