To answer this question, this study first developed a hybrid turbulence model which was suitable for predicting the air distribution in an aircraft cabin with gaspers turned on. Next, the investigation validated the model using two sets of experimental data from a cabin mockup and an actual airplane. This study then used the validated model to systematically investigate the impact of gaspers on cabin air quality in a seven-row section of the fully-occupied, economy-class cabin of Boeing 767 and 737 airplanes. The CFD calculations formed a database consisting of 9660 data points that provide information about SARS infection risk. It was found that the distribution of opened gaspers can influence the infection risk for passengers. Even though the gasper supplies clean air, it is possible for it to have a negative impact on the passengers' health. Statistically speaking, the overall effect of turning on the gaspers on the mean infection risk for the general population was neutral.",

With the rapid increase in air travel [5] , improving cabin air quality has become crucial to public health. In commercial airplanes, personalized ventilation is typically provided by a system of gaspers, the small, circular, and adjustable vents above the seats passengers. When passengers turn on the gaspers, the air distribution in the cabin is altered [6, 7] . Consequently, the transport of airborne infectious contaminants is affected [8] . It is important to investigate the impact of gaspers on cabin air quality in commercial airliners in order to evaluate the effectiveness of gasper-induced ventilation in reducing the risk of infection.",

[6] measured the airflow field in a full-scale, half-row, single-aisle aircraft cabin mockup with one gasper turned on, using a particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. The measured data showed that the gasper-induced flow, the main flow in the cabin, and the thermal plume from a passenger interacted with each other and formed a complex flow field. Li et al. [8] measured the distributions of air velocity, temperature, and contaminant concentrations in the economy cabin of a functional MD-82 airplane with gaspers on and off.

[6] evaluated the performance of the renormalization group (RNG) k-\u03b5 model and the shear stress transport (SST) k-u model using their measured data. The SST k-u model was found to be more accurate than the RNG k-\u03b5 model for predicting the air distribution of a gasperinduced jet. Shi et al. [10] calculated the entrainment ratio at different locations along a gasper-induced jet using a CFD model. They found that over 90% of the air in the breathing zone of a passenger was entrained from the surroundings when the gasper was turned on. Note that both of these studies used a detailed geometry with a large grid number to represent the actual gasper in the CFD simulations, which led to an unacceptably high computing cost. To overcome this problem, You et al. [7] developed a simplified gasper model to reduce the grid number for the gaspers without compromising the accuracy of the results.",

To answer this question, this study first developed a hybrid turbulence model which was more suitable than previous models for predicting the air distribution in an aircraft cabin with gaspers turned on. The developed model was then validated using two sets of experimental data measured in a cabin mockup and an actual airplane.

            "text": "To obtain the air distribution in an aircraft cabin with gaspers turned on, it is important to identify an accurate and robust turbulence model. According to a number of comparative studies, the RNG k-\u03b5 model is the most robust Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model for predicting air distribution in the bulk air regions in enclosed environments [11e14] . However, the RNG k-\u03b5 model fails to accurately predict the complex airflow in the near wall regions, because it uses a wall function instead of resolving the near wall airflow. In aircraft cabins, the airflow near a human body, where the gasper-induced jet encounters the thermal plume, could be very important in terms of thermal comfort and contaminant transport [6] . Several comparative studies found that the SST k-u model was superior in predicting airflow in the near wall regions [6, 10] . This is because the SST k-u model uses the standard k-u model in the near wall regions, which resolves the near wall airflow. In the bulk air regions, however, the SST k-u model utilizes the standard k-\u03b5 model, which is less robust than the RNG k-\u03b5 model. Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop a hybrid turbulence model for cabin airflow simulations, one which will not only be robust in the bulk air regions but also accurate in the near wall regions. This hybrid turbulence model will use the standard k-u model in the near wall regions and a transformed RNG k-\u03b5 model in the bulk air regions. A blending function will be employed to gradually switch the two models on and off. This section details the development of the model.",

Note that the measurements were taken in the bulk air regions. In these regions, the hybrid turbulence model is expected to be robust because it utilizes the RNG k-\u03b5 model. This case, with measured data in a real aircraft cabin, shows that the hybrid model can be successfully applied in a realistic and complex scenario. In summary, the first case, with accurate and high-resolution data, confirmed that the hybrid turbulence model was superior to the RNG k-\u03b5 model, especially in the near wall regions. The second case, with measured data in a real airplane, demonstrated that the hybrid model could be successfully applied in realistic and complex cases. Therefore, the developed hybrid turbulence model was used to investigate the impact of gaspers on cabin air quality in commercial airliners, as discussed in the next section.",

(seats a, b, f and g) , individual gaspers is installed in the ceiling above the seats to provide fresh air. For the passengers seated between the aisles (seats c, d, and e), gaspers are installed in the middle of the ceiling. In contrast, the Boeing 737 has a single-aisle cabin with six seats in each row. Two main supply-air diffusers are located in the center of the ceiling and another two side diffusers in the ceiling above the window seats. The exhausts are installed in the side walls near the floor. The gaspers are installed in the ceiling, one above each passenger. The total ventilation rate was set at 33.7 ACH for both airplanes [20] . The airflow rate from each gasper was set at 0.66 L/s [8] . The supply-air temperature was 19.3 C. The temperatures of the walls and the passengers were set at 24.5 and 31 C, respectively. According to symmetry, this study evaluated four source locations, the mouths of passengers seated at d4, e4, f4, and g4, in the Boeing 767. Similarly, three source locations, the mouths of passengers seated at c4, d4, and e4, were considered in the Boeing 737.",

To illustrate the method, this paper uses the Boeing 767 cases as an example. First, this study considered five different gasper on/off ratios, 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. These ratios indicate that, of the total of 49 gaspers, the corresponding number of gaspers that are turned on is 0, 12, 24, 37, or 49, respectively.

Thus, when the calculated NRMSE under a given number of runs was less than 10%, the generated cases were representative of all the gasper on/ off distributions. Using this criterion, the total numbers of cases under different gasper on/off ratios could be determined.

The total number of gasper on/off distribution scenarios is 30 for The validated hybrid turbulence model was then used to calculate the airflow distribution with the gasper on/off distributions determined by the quasi-random sampling method. The contaminant concentration distribution for each case was calculated using the Eulerian method. Finally, the risk of acquiring SARS for each passenger was calculated using the Wells-Riley equation. The quanta of SARS was set at 2670 per hour [22] , and the breathing flow rate of each passenger was set at 0.00053 m 3 /s, according to the ISO standard [23] . The flight durations for the Boeing 767 and Boeing 737 were set at 5 and 2 h, respectively, according to the actual durations of 1000 flights of the major airliners in the U.S. Since there were four contaminant source locations in the Boeing 767 and three locations in the Boeing 737, the total number of CFD cases was 420. Furthermore, there were 49 passengers in the cabin of the Boeing 767 and 42 in the Boeing 737; thus, this study generated a database containing 9660 data points for the risk of acquiring SARS.",

In other words, for a given source location, the database contains many data points for each passenger, corresponding to different gasper on/off distributions. Using the database, this study calculated the mean, maximum, minimum, 75th percentile, and 25th percentile of the infection risks for each passenger with various source locations. Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the data for each passenger when the source was located at seats 4d and 4g, respectively, in the Boeing 767. The points, the upper and lower bounds of the error bars, and the upper and lower bounds of the boxes represent the mean, the maximum and minimum, and the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively, of the infection risks for each passenger. Note that these variations were caused by the different gasper on/off distributions. The results show that the gasper on/off distribution can significantly affect the infection risk for each passenger. For example, when the source was at 4g, the SARS infection risk for the passenger seated at 3c ranged from 0.08 to 0.92 under different distributions. This variation occurred because the gasper-induced flows altered the air distribution in the cabin, which in turn influenced contaminant transport from the source and the receptors. To keep the paper concise, only the results with the source at seats 4d and 4g are shown in the figure. The results with the source at seats 4e and 4f point to the same conclusion. Fig. 8 shows the results for the Boeing 737. This figure is analogous to Fig. 7 , except that the source in the Boeing 737 was at seats 4d and 4f. As in the Boeing 767, the SARS infection risk can be significantly influenced by the gasper on/off distribution. For instance, when the source was at 4d, the infection risk for the passenger seated at 6f ranged from 0.18 to 0.98 under different distributions. Therefore, for both the Boeing 767 and Boeing 737, the impact of gaspers on cabin air quality was significant.",

Statistically speaking, however, it is still unknown whether turning on a passenger's gasper will have a positive or negative impact on his/her infection risk. To answer this question, this study calculated the mean infection risk from the database for each passenger when he/she turned on his/her gasper. The mean infection risk for each passenger when he/she did not turn on the gasper was also calculated. Note that Figs. 9 and 10 included all cases in the database. Fig. 9 compares the mean SARS infection risk for the 49 passengers in the Boeing 767 when they turned their gaspers on and off. The horizontal axis indicates the mean infection risk when the gasper was off, while the vertical axis indicates the risk when the gasper was on. The solid line represents the 1:1 line, while the dashed line is the linear regression. Each point represents a passenger. If a point is located exactly on the 1:1 line, it means that there was no difference in the mean infection risk for that passenger when his/her gasper was turned on and off. If a point is above the 1:1 line, it means that turning on the gasper increased the mean infection risk for this passenger. If a point is below the 1:1 line, the risk was reduced by turning the gasper on. It can be seen in the figures that most of the points are close to the 1:1 line, and the slopes of the linear regressions are close to 1 with high R 2 values. These results indicate that, statistically speaking, the overall effect of turning on a passenger's gasper on the mean infection risk for the passenger was neutral for the general population. Fig. 10 is analogous to Fig. 9 , except that there were 42 passengers in the Boeing 737. Again, most of the points were close to the 1:1 line, and the slopes of the linear regressions were close to 1 with high R 2 values. The results for the Boeing 737 led to the same conclusion as for the 767: statistically speaking, if a passenger turned on his/her gasper, there was an equal chance of either a positive or negative impact on his/her infection risk.",

First, the gasper on/off distribution can significantly influence the infection risk for each passenger.

That is to say, turning on a passenger's gasper could result in either a positive or negative impact on his/her infection risk. The practical implication is that, even though a gasper supplies clean air that is aimed at a passenger, it may actually have a negative effect on the passenger's health. If the specific gasper on/off distribution produces a high contaminant concentration in the region above a passenger's head, turning on the gasper may bring more contaminants into the breathing zone of the passenger as a result of the strong air entrainment [10] . Therefore, when a passenger is deciding whether or not to turn on his/her gasper, the conventional understanding that the clean air supplied from the gasper enhances the air quality is not necessarily correct. If the passenger's health is fragile, he/she should consider not turning on the gasper to avoid the possibility of increased infection risk. ",
