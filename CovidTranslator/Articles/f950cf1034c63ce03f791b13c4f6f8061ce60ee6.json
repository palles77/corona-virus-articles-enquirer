Subsequently, the virus was associated with a dengue-like illness in African children and later with occasional cases of aseptic meningitis in the Middle East. Ironically, the first documented cases of encephalitis due to West Nile virus were in New York City in 1954 after 95 patients with advanced cancer were inoculated with the virus on the premise that the ''harmless'' virus might selectively destroy tumor cells. Nine patients developed encephalitis, and virus was recovered from the cerebrospinal fluid of three patients [8] . Naturally occurring cases of encephalitis began to appear in the Mediterranean basin in the 1990s. A radical change in the epidemiologic pattern was then seen, with large epidemics of encephalitis with high mortality rates. The first epidemics occurred in Bucharest in 1996 and then in Volgograd in 1999. Clearly, a more virulent strain of the virus had evolved in this region [9] .",

Initially the disease was thought to be Japanese encephalitis, an endemic arthropod-borne disease in the region; however, the new disease affected primarily adults, occurred in household clusters, was associated with contacts with pigs that were ill, and affected some persons who had been immunized against Japanese encephalitis virus. Each of these factors suggested an alternative cause. In March of 1999, a paramyxovirus named Nipah virus was recovered and related to the disease [15] . An outbreak in a single abattoir in Singapore gave insight into the epidemiology of the infection, since only workers transporting or slaughtering pigs became infected. No family member or medical caregiver had evidence of infection, indicating a lack of human-to-human spread [16] . The slaughter of tens of thousands of pigs in Malaysia brought an end to the outbreak, but only after over 100 patients had died.",

Multiple studies indicate that leukocytes are chronically infected, together with a persistent viremia. More recently, several studies suggest that HCV-encoded genome (both positive and negative strand RNA) and proteins are detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain, often in the setting of HIV-1 coinfection. Both monocytoid (macrophages and microglia) and astrocytes can express selective viral proteins. The extent to which accompanying cellular (and humoral) immunity contributes to neural tissue injury as a bystander cytotoxic effect, or whether virus-encoded proteins are secreted and subsequently injure proximate cells (as proposed for HIV-1) remains uncertain to date. Nonetheless, quantitative neuropsychologic studies and neuroimaging including MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) disclose abnormalities in HCV-infected patients, which are compounded by HIV-1 coinfection. Although pegylated interferonalpha is an effective therapy for some HCV subtypes, its impact on HCVrelated neurologic disease remains uncertain. As this epidemic grows, the increased risk of neurologic disease requires vigilance and intervention as indicated.",

The measles virus has only one host, humans, but to maintain the virus an interactive population of about 200,000 is required; otherwise, the virus disappears as it does on sparsely populated islands. The virus could not have persisted in early Neolithic or nomadic cultures. Indeed, the typical exanthem of measles was not described by Greek and Roman physicians but was first recorded by Rhazes of Baghdad. He dated its arrival in the Arab world to the sixth century. Contemporary sequence analysis indicates that the measles virus was probably derived from rhinderpest virus of African or Asian cattle, suggesting an early zoonotic spread across species barriers. The appearance of measles in France and Northern Europe has been dated to the eighth century after the Moorish invasion. Apparently, it was confined below the Pyrenees for centuries until an army crossed the mountains, maintaining the virus by soldierto-soldier spread. Today, a similar virus could cross this geographic barrier in hours.",

Indeed, multiple molecular tools have been used over the past decade to characterize West Nile virus, the SARS coronavirus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV-8) [28] . The recent development of this combined diagnostic approach was particularly rewarding because it led to the discovery of a new human arena virus causing fever and encephalitis. Both PCR and oligonucleotide microarray studies were unremarkable, but subsequent high-throughput DNA pyrosequencing of patient-derived cDNA, together with bioinformatics analyses of protein sequences to exclude human sequences, resulted in the identification of a new neurovirulent arena virus. This metagenomic pyrosequencing approach, albeit, cumbersome at a bioinformatics level, is unbiased in terms of identifying novel sequences and will be invaluable for the discovery and detection of new infectious agents of the nervous system [29] .",

Perhaps the greatest promise lies in the use of small molecules to prevent bystander-mediate injury of the brain.
