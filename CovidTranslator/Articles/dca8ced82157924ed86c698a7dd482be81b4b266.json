No specific treatment for this infection is currently available. We previously reported that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic which has routinely been used in the clinic to treat bacterial infection with low toxicity, significantly inhibits the invasion of cells by Ebola virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, via specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L. Here, we tested the efficacy of teicoplanin against 2019-nCoV virus infection and found that teicoplanin potently prevents the entrance of 2019-nCoV-Spike-pseudoviruses into the cytoplasm, with an IC 50 of 1.66 \u03bcM. Although the inhibitory effect upon the replication of wildtype viruses ex vivo and in vivo remains to be determined, our preliminary result indicates that the potential antiviral activity of teicoplanin could be applied for the treatment of 2019-nCoV virus infection.",

In this study, we have compared the cleavage site of cathepsin L in 2019-nCoV with that in SARS-CoV and found it is well conserved.

As a routinely-used clinical antibiotics, teicoplanin is well known for its much low toxic and side effects, long half-life in blood plasma, convenient administration, and high safety when used in combination with other antibiotics. The recommended plasma concentration of teicoplanin for clinical use to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria is 15 mg / L, or 8.78 \u03bcM, and the commonly used dose is 400 mg / day. Here we found the IC 50 inhibition of 2019-nCOV was only 1.66 u\u039c, which is much lower than the routine clinical drug concentration.

Because cathepsin L has been identified as a target of teicoplanin, it is important to identify whether the cleavage site of cathepsin L exists on the 2019-nCOV S protein. After alignment, we found that the cleavage site of cathepsin L is well conserved between the SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV S protein (Figure 1A), suggesting that cathepsin L could participant in the 2019-nCoV entry and fusion 26,31,32 .",

Here, we identified that teicoplanin acted specifically as a 2019-nCoV entry inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B). It demonstrated an IC 50 of 1.66 uM for its inhibitory effect on HIV-luc/2019-nCoV-S pseudoviruses (Figure. 2C). Teicoplanin and dalbavancin repress the entry of 2019-nCoV in different cell types. Considering that ACE2 is a major receptor of 2019-nCoV, we have further analyzed the expression of ACE2 in different cell types from the GEO Profiles database and it was important to examine whether teicoplanin could repress the entry of 2019-nCoV viruses into different types of cells.

Discussion Host cell entry is the first step of viral life cycle and is an ideal drug target for viral infection. In this study, we identified that teicoplanin could inhibit the entry of HIV-1-2019-nCoV-S pseudoviruses with the IC 50 value of 1.66 uM. During the invasion phase, 2019-nCoV first binds to the receptor ACE2 on the surface of host cells. The interaction between RBD domain of S protein and ACE2 triggers conformational changes within S protein, which render the S protein susceptible to activation by host cell protease TMPRSS2 20,30,33 . Subsequently, the 2019-nCoV virus enters the early endosome of the cell through endocytosis or macropinocytosis. During the early endosome maturation process, the acidifies, which has an important impact on the entry of virus into cells. The inhibitory effect of chloroquine on 2019-nCoV support this hypothesis 17,34 . The cysteine proteases cathepsin L in the endosome can further cleave the S protein, and activate the membrane fusion. It has been proposed that sequential cleavages of SARS-CoV S protein by TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L are necessary for fully exposure of fusion peptide at S2 region to the late endosome/lysosome membrane 35 . Our work indicates that both TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L are required for 2019-nCoV entrance, and teicoplanin potently prevents the 2019-nCoV S protein activation by directly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of cathepsin L (Figure 4) 27 .",
