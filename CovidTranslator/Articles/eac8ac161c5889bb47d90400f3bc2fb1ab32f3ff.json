            "text": "Due to worsening of lung disease and lymph node swelling, dynamic computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy were performed on day 38 of illness. The dynamic CT was performed in the arterial phase (20 sec after the injection of contrast medium), in the portal vein phase (60 sec) and in the equilibrium phase (180 sec) using 2 ml/kg nonionic contrast medium (300 mg/ml iohexol, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Tokyo, Japan). CT scan revealed bilateral peribronchial consolidation, swollen jejunum lymph node with uniform distribution of contrast medium, and multiple prominent nodules of the liver (Fig. 3A) . These nodules exhibited lower CT values than that of liver parenchyma in plain image and were not enhanced with dynamic CT (Fig. 3B ). Contrast enhancement of peripheral areas of the liver nodules was observed in the arterial phase; however, it disappeared in the portal vein phase. During bronchoscopy, intratracheal foreign bodies, increased mucus production, and redness of bronchial mucosa were not found. Cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed a small number of neutrophils and macrophages without any bacteria. When FNA cytology of the liver was performed, neutrophils, small lymphocytes, and large macrophages were observed. The specimens of bronchoscopy and liver FNA were submitted to research laboratory (Japan Clinical Laboratories, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) for culture of general bacteria, fungus, and Mycobacterium species. These examinations revealed that general bacteria and fungus were culture-negative, and Mycobacterium species were smear-negative with Ziehl-Neelsen staining but culture-positive in Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube systems (Becton, Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ, U.S.A.). The pathogen was confirmed as M. avium through DNA-DNA hybridization techniques with DDH Mycobacteria \"Kyokuto\" (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) [18] . Antitubercular drug susceptibility testing determined by the proportion test method on egg-based ogawa media (Vite Spectrum SR, Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial Co., Ltd.) revealed that the bacterial isolate was resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, ethambutol, kanamycin, enviomycin, ethionamide, para-aminosalicylic acid, and levofloxacin; however, it was sensitive to cycloserine ( Table 2 ) [26] . In order to identify the subspecies of M. avium isolate recovered from the clinical sample, we determined the nucleotide sequence of hsp65 (GenBank accession number LC497502) and compared single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the M. avium strains, which were categorized into \"codes\" 1 to 9, and 15 to 17 depending on their sequence (Table 3 ) as described previously [27] . The sequence from our sample, however, was not a complete match with any hsp65 sequences from code 1 to 9, and 15 to 17. We then created the phylogenetic tree of hsp65 using the sequences deposited in GenBank belonging to codes 1 to 9, and 15 to 17 [1, 12] (Fig. 4) . Codes 1 to 3, 7 to 9, and 15 to 17 are found in MAH. Code 4 is from M. avium subsp. avium, and codes 5 and 6 are from M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. The hsp65 sequence from our specimen, shown as strain MY332, was closest to that in code 9 and located in the group composed of codes 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, and 17. These results indicated that the isolate from the clinical sample was MAH. Due to the positive culture results for the Mycobacterium species, we started orally combined administration of antibiotics (isoniazid 10 mg/kg every 24 hr, rifampicin 10 mg/kg every 24 hr, and enrofloxacin 5 mg/kg every 24 hr) on day 66 of illness. However, atonic seizures occurred in increasing frequency from day 93 of illness. The chest X-ray and ultrasound imaging revealed the improvement of lung disease and jejunum lymph node swelling, which indicated the therapeutic response of MAH infection. We administered pyridoxal phosphate (1 mg/kg every 24 hr) and clarithromycin (10 mg/kg every 12 hr) instead of isoniazid. Atonic seizures disappeared within a week. On day 107 of illness, lung disease was in remission and the jejunum lymph node had begun to shrink. On day 246 of illness, CT scan revealed that the peribronchial consolidation and the multiple nodules of the liver had disappeared ( Fig. 3C and 3D ). Furthermore, bronchus and liver FNA specimens were culture-negative in Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube systems. We stopped antibiotic administration on day 429 of illness, and there were no clinical signs, evidence of lung disease in chest X-Ray, or obvious lymph node swelling in ultrasound images on day 771 of illness.",

In Great Britain, previous reports have revealed that 1.16% of 11,782 feline tissue samples submitted to diagnostic laboratories were confirmed to have Mycobacterium infections [10] , and 15% of cultured Mycobacterium species were M. avium. In Japan, Mycobacterium infections in domestic cats have been historically uncommon, with only two cases reported: unclassified Mycobacterium species (MFM001 strain) [13] and MAH in the Kanto region [20] . This is the third reported case of Mycobacterium species infection in a domestic cat in Japan. In Japan, pulmonary NTM diseases are commonly diagnosed in human medicine with an incidence rate of 14.7 cases per 100,000 person-years in 2016, which is 2.6 times higher than the incidence rate reported in 2007 [25] . The most common pathogens of pulmonary NTM diseases were M. avium in the northern and eastern parts of Japan and M. intracellulare in the southern and western parts of Japan. Mycobacterium infection should also be considered a potential disease for domestic cats. In a previous study in Australia, it was observed that certain lines of Abyssinian and Somali cats likely suffer from a familial immunodeficiency that predisposes them to infection with slow-growing mycobacteria, including M. avium [2] . Whilst immunological predisposition of those breeds has not been well proven, it will be beneficial to pay attention to the breed of cats with suspected Mycobacterium infections.",

Our case was completely kept indoors; therefore, we suspected inapparent infection in youth or infection from polluted water or food. After ingestion, M. avium is phagocytosed by intestinal macrophages and eventually causes diseases due to stress or acquired or inborn immunosuppression [8] . In human and veterinary medicine, some cases of M. avium infection have been diagnosed with blood culture; therefore, hematogenous dissemination of M. avium has been considered [1, 5, 19] . Previously reported clinical findings of MAH infection in cats are lymphadenopathy, skin abscesses, skin granulomas, meningoencephalitis, and lung nodules [3, 15, 20] . In the present study, diffuse parenchymal lung diseases and granulomatous inflammation of the lymph node and liver were observed. We suspected that our case was infected via ingestion of polluted water or food and MAH disseminated to the jejunum lymph nodes, liver, and lungs. MAH infection should therefore be considered a differential diagnosis for lung diseases or granulomatous inflammation of uncertain cause. A previous study identified the same clinical findings and splenomegaly in cats with M. avium infection, though potential subspecies were not analyzed [2] . In the present study, no spleen abnormalities were found with ultrasound imaging or CT scan.

            "text": "During combined administration of antibiotics, this case presented atonic seizures. As the possible causes of seizures, we considered MAH infiltration into central nervous systems, side effects of isoniazid, or other intracranial diseases. Chest X-ray and ultrasound imaging revealed the improvement of lung disease and jejunum lymph node swelling, which indicated the therapeutic response of MAH infection. Therefore, a side effect of isoniazid, whose recommended dosage range was 10 \u2212 20 mg/kg every 24 hr [8] , was suspected as the cause of seizures. In human medicine, isoniazid administration for patients with concurrent diseases, such as chronic kidney disease and diabetes, sometimes causes atonic seizures, and these side effects can be prevented and treated Fig. 4 . hsp65 gene sequences from 12 nontuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) species retrieved from GenBank belonging to codes 1 to 9, and 15 to 17 (accession numbers DQ284765\u2212DQ284773, EU085419, AB453830, and AB453831, respectively), and from the present clinical isolate (strain MY332) were aligned using Mega7 [17] . Phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method. with pyridoxal phosphate [7] . In the present case, there were no clinical findings to indicate concurrent diseases. However, we should consider the possibility that the multiple nodules in the liver potentially affected the metabolism of isoniazid even though isoniazid was administered at the minimum recommended dosage. Three cats were previously reported with MAH infection. Two were diagnosed at necropsy [3, 20] . One, which presented with chronic vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, anorexia and an abdominal mass, was treated with combined antibiotics, including azithromycin, rifampicin and enrofloxacin [15] . However, after a short period of improvement of clinical symptoms, the cat was euthanized because of severe protein-losing enteropathy. Although treatment and prognosis of M. avium infection in domestic cats in Australia has been reported, Mycobacterium subspecies were not identified in these cases [2] . This is therefore the first case of MAH infection to be confirmed by gene analysis and to show recovery with combination antibiotic treatment. The poor prognosis in previous cases could be attributed to difficulties in the antemortem diagnosis and delayed start time for treatment of MAH infection after clinical symptoms were observed. This case demonstrates that combined antibiotic administration based on reports from human medicine is effective for MAH infection in cats, and early examinations, diagnosis and treatment will lead to a good result. Susceptibility testing revealed that the MAH isolate was resistant to most antitubercular drugs. However, we administered combined antibiotics including isoniazid and rifampicin, which the MAH isolate was resistant to, and clinical symptoms improved. Previous studies revealed that in vitro susceptibility testing for Mycobacterium species was of little or no value for predicting clinical efficacy [4, 11] . The present study indicated that it is difficult to predict therapeutic effects of antitubercular drugs for MAH depending on in vitro susceptibility testing in domestic cats.",

In domestic cats, it was recommended that treatment of feline leprosy syndrome, which was caused by Mycobacterium species, should ideally be continued for a further 3 months after lesions have regressed in order to reduce the risk of recurrence [23] . However, the optimal length of drug therapy for MAH has not yet been established. Here, we administered combination antibiotics for 6 months until NTM culture yielded negative results, and no symptoms or abnormal findings were detected in X-Ray or ultrasound images. Further studies might be needed to identify the optimal treatment duration of MAH infection.",
