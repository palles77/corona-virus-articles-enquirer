Important parameters to consider when sequencing antibody repertoires include the methodology, the B-cell population and clinical characteristics of the individuals analysed, and the bioinformatic analysis. Although focused sequencing of immunoglobulin heavy chains or complement determining regions can be utilized to monitor particular immune responses and B-cell malignancies, high-fidelity analysis of the full-length paired heavy and light chains expressed by individual B cells is critical for characterizing functional antibody repertoires. Bioinformatic identification of clonal antibody families and recombinant expression of representative members produces recombinant antibodies that can be used to identify the antigen targets of functional immune responses and to investigate the mechanisms of their protective or pathogenic functions. Integrated analysis of coexpressed functional genes provides the potential to further pinpoint the most important antibodies and clonal families generated during an immune response. Sequencing antibody repertoires is transforming our understanding of immune responses to autoimmunity, vaccination, infection and cancer. We anticipate that antibody repertoire sequencing will provide next-generation biomarkers, diagnostic tools and therapeutic antibodies for a spectrum of diseases, including rheumatic diseases.",

            "text": "Antibodies are a major component of the adaptive immune system and have critical roles in protective and pathogenic immune responses. In response to microbial infection, vaccination, autoimmune disease or cancer, the immune system generates distinct antibody repertoires. Analysis of these antibody repertoires, particularly those contributing to functional immune responses, can provide important information on protective and pathogenic immunity. In autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune rheumatic diseases, antibody characterization has enabled the identification of autoantigens and has provided insights into the underlying mechanisms of disease; furthermore, detection of autoantibodies has become a cornerstone of modern diagnostics. [1] [2] [3] In infectious diseases, in which antibody responses are usually protective, there is growing interest in isolating antibodies that could be developed as novel therapeutic agents 4, 5 and in using microbial antigens and epitopes targeted by antibody responses to develop vaccines. 4, 6, 7 A challenge in understanding, as well as in diagnostically and therapeutically harnessing, antibody responses is the identification of antibodies that underlie functional immune responses, that is, antibodies that directly contribute to an immune outcome, such as neutralizing a microbial pathogen or mediating autoimmune tissue injury. This Review provides an overview of technologies for large-scale sequencing of antibody repertoires, and discusses how these technologies can be applied to characterize immune responses and identify antibodies of therapeutic, diagnostic or mechanistic relevance to autoimmune diseases, including rheumatic diseases.",

            "text": "Antibodies are comprised of an immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and light chain (IgL), each containing an antigen-binding domain that is generated by the recombination, junctional diversification and somatic hypermutation of variable (V), joining (J) and/or diversity (D) gene segments during B-cell development. 8, 9 The complementaritydetermining regions (CDRs), CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3, as well as the surrounding framework regions, together form the antigen-binding site of the antibody. 10 In the primary B-cell repertoire, substantial diversity in antibody specificity comes from the IgH CDR3 owing to its generation both from combinatorial gene segments and from N-region diversity. 10 In an ongoing immune response to an antigen, B cells that produce antibodies specific for that antigen further diversify by undergoing clonal expansion and by somatic hypermutation of their antibody variable regions. In this process, termed affinity maturation, B cells that express antibodies with an increased affinity for the activating antigen as a result of somatic hypermutation are selected for further expansion (Figure 1 ). [11] [12] [13] These antigenactivated, affinity-matured B cells are then released from germinal centers into the blood as short-lived or long-lived plasmablasts, which migrate to other secondary lymphoid organs and sites of tissue injury, and can differentiate into long-lived memory B cells and plasma cells. 14, 15 Identifying antigens For most diseases, knowledge of the antigens and epitopes targeted by antibody responses is limited. For example, autoimmune diseases affect 3% of the global population, yet in most of these diseases the pathogenic autoantigens have not been identified. 16 In infectious diseases, most of the critical microbial antigens and epitopes targeted by protective antibody responses are also unidentified, 17 with the exception of HIV antigens, influenza and some other microbes. 18 With regards to cancer, T-cell-mediated responses are still considered the primary form of immunity. Although immunotherapies are now revolutionizing cancer therapy, 19, 20 the specific targets of the immune response to these therapies are unclear, as is the contribution of antibody responses to effective anticancer immunity.",

Serum (and plasma) samples contain a pool of all the antibodies produced by an individual, including antibodies that are heterogeneous, bind to many different antigens, and have differing affinities and avidities, thereby increasing background reactivity and diluting potential antibodies of interest. Furthermore, most serum antibodies are produced by plasma cells generated in prior immune responses, and are not produced by the plasmablasts or plasma cells responding to the immunogenic antigen of interest.",

Antigen-agnostic approaches (Box 1) are therefore needed for identifying important functional antibodies and their targets. An ideal solution is to isolate, recombinantly express, and characterize antibodies produced by the specific subset of B cells participating in functional immune responses to vaccination, infection, cancer or other diseases, in humans or other animals.

During an immune response, plasmablasts differentiate from antigen-activated B cells and are released from germinal centers to transiently circulate in the bloodstream before migrating to secondary lymphoid organs or to inflamed tissues, where they can differentiate into longer-lived tissue-resident plasma cells. [30] [31] [32] Plasmablasts in peripheral blood form not only from newly generated naive B cells, but also from reactivated memory B cells. Together with the relative ease of isolating plasmablasts, their origin from either naive or memory B cells make them the ideal B-cell population to analyse when searching for antibodies associated with any given immune response. For example, studies sequencing the antibody response to influenza vaccination have detected a transient increase in peripheral blood plasmablast numbers, >75% of which produced anti-influenza antibodies. 33, 34 Although autoimmune diseases are chronic, evidence exists that underlying autoantibody responses involve continuous activation and reactivation of new B-cell clones, 35 such that peripheral blood plasmablasts could produce new pathogenic antibodies at any stage of the disease. Indeed, in patients with RA, the proportion of plasmablasts in the blood correlates positively with disease activity, 27, 36 and these cells produce anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) 27, 28 that are known to contribute to the pathology of RA. 37, 38 Tissueresident plasma cells might also produce ACPAs and might even be generated in situ in the synovial tissue of patients with RA; however, these tissue-resident cells are not easily accessible. [39] [40] [41] Memory B cells-Memory B cells form during germinal centre reactions and provide an accelerated antibody response upon re-exposure to a target antigen. 42 Whereas >75% of peripheral blood plasmablasts are specific for the antigens targeted by the ongoing immune response, 33, 34, 43 antigen-specific memory B cells are present at much lower frequencies; approximately 1 of 2,500-100,000 memory B cells in blood are specific for the inciting antigen. 42, 44, 45 These memory B cells can be isolated by antigen-sorting (by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting [FACS] , with fluorescently-labelled antigen baits to sort the cells by the specificity of their membrane immunoglobulins) of memory B cells from peripheral blood; however, because of the low frequency of antigen-specific memory B cells, such sorting requires large numbers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The substantial differences in the antigen load, prior exposure history, route of exposure, and associated immunostimulatory molecules in different vaccines, microbial infections, and autoimmune diseases influence the magnitude and properties of antibody responses, and modifications of antibody repertoire sequencing methods might be needed to effectively characterize the antibody responses in these conditions. Tissue-infiltrating B cells-Analysis of tissue-infiltrating B cells could also help to characterize functional antibody responses. Despite being more difficult to access than peripheral blood B cells, characterization of tissue-infiltrating B cells in both autoimmune disease 46, 47 and in cancer 48 has identified disease-associated antibodies. Integrated analysis of the B-cell antibody repertoires in the synovium and blood of patients with RA, and the brain and blood of patients with multiple sclerosis, 46,47 is providing insights into the sites of B-cell activation and affinity maturation in these diseases.",

Although both IgHs and IgLs can be sequenced simultaneously in bulk mRNA, pairing of the IgH and IgL sequences obtained in this way can only be attempted according to similarities in sequence frequency; 73 this pairing is not always accurate. Without the accurate pairing of the cognate IgHs and IgLs, the information generated about an antibody response is incomplete.",

Results from bulk IgH sequencing of unsorted B cells suggest that direct analysis of isolated B-cell subsets might be necessary for obtaining the most informative data regarding diseases of immune function. 76 Additional data are needed to assess whether sequencing of a single chain or a single-chain CDR3 will provide biomarkers with clinical utility. 77 The functional antibody repertoire-Many challenges must be overcome to understand and identify functional antibody repertoires (Table 1 ). In addition to high throughput analysis, a comprehensive survey of the B-cell repertoire requires sequences that enable accurate recreation of endogenous, bioinformatically selected antibodies, so that their antigen specificity, binding and functional properties can be characterized. To accurately recreate recombinant versions of endogenous antibodies, one must sequence and correctly pair the cognate IgHs and IgLs expressed by individual B cells, ensure that the sequencing covers the entire variable regions encoding the CDR1, CDR2, CDR3 and framework regions of both the IgHs and IgLs, and ensure that the sequences are error-free. 10, 61, 78, 79 Highprocess fidelity and quality are major challenges for the robust analysis of antibody repertoires, and are further discussed in this article. Furthermore, to enable bioinformatic identification of important functional antibodies, antibody repertoire sequencing must be applied to the appropriate B-cell subsets derived from individuals with an immunological phenotype of interest (Table 1) .",

Because each B cell has multiple copies of mRNA encoding its IgH and IgL genes, cell barcoding creates consensus IgH and IgL sequences for each cell and thereby enables correction not only of errors inherent to the sequencing platform, but also of those arising from RT-PCR ( Figure  3b ). Furthermore, cell-barcoding enables accurate calculation of B-cell clonal proportions (Figure 3c ), providing error-corrected sequences of the full-length V regions of natively paired IgHs and IgLs and enabling direct gene synthesis of the variable regions of the antibodies for recombinant expression. This approach has been used to understand human plasmablast antibody responses to RA, 27 Staphylococcus aureus infection, 43 and influenza vaccination. 34 Bioinformatic analysis of sequence datasets can lead to the development of phylogenetic trees to guide selection and recombinant expression of plasmablast antibodies, including ACPAs implicated in the pathogenesis of RA, 27 or antibodies that mediate opsonophagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus 43 or that neutralize influenza. 34 With this method, rapid and comprehensive characterization of antibody responses is possible, as is the generation of affinity-matured, monoclonal human antibodies with high efficiency relative to hybridoma and other classical approaches for generating monoclonal antibodies. Wardemann and colleagues developed a 2D barcode primer matrix PCR that utilizes distinct sets of barcoded V-gene forward primers and barcoded constant-region reverse PCR primers for multiplex cell-based barcoding of single-cell-sorted B cells (Figure 2c) . 61, 85 Droplet PCR-Several groups are working to develop droplet-based approaches that utilize beads, linkage-PCR or barcodes to enable the sequencing of IgH and IgL pairs expressed by individual B cells (Figure 2d) . 61, 83 These techniques offer the potential to increase throughput analysis and reduce costs. Furthermore, droplet PCR, also termed digital PCR, isolates and amplifies individual DNA molecules in emulsion droplets and thereby reduces PCR bias. 86",

The sampling depth necessary to characterize a functional antibody response depends on the population of B cells analysed. For example, antigen-specific memory B cells are present in blood at frequencies of 1:2,500-100,000 cells; 42 therefore, a relatively large number of cells must be obtained from the blood (or in some cases by leukapharesis) to isolate memory B cells with a specific antigen specificity, or to identify clonal families of memory B cells. By contrast, plasmablasts produced during an active antibody response have extensive redundancy in clonal families, and a number of groups have calculated that >75% of peripheral blood plasmablasts express antibodies specific to the antigenic target of an ongoing immune response. 33, 34, 43, 87 As a result, when sequencing the plasmablast antibody repertoire of an individual with a functional immune response, analysis of hundreds to thousands of plasmablasts (obtained from a little as 15 mL blood, or just 1-3 mL from infants) is sufficient for robustly identifying and characterizing the clonal families. 27, 34, 43 Bioinformatic methods-A number of bioinformatics methods have been developed for V(D)J gene assignment and antibody repertoire analysis, 88, 89 and clonal families can be defined as B cells that share IgH VJ and IgL VJ usage. In stricter definitions of clonal families, the IgH VJs and IgL VJs must have identical CDR3 lengths or the amino acid sequences must have a certain degree of homology, suggesting that the B cells that express these antibodies arose from the same B cell progenitor. 90 Clonal families can be generated by expansion of a common progenitor B cell, by independent de novo recombination events, or by convergent evolution of B-cell responses, that is, accumulation of mutations in B cells that express IgH V(D)J and IgL VJ of different genomic origins, resulting in convergence of encoded antibody sequences. 91, 92 Regardless of their particular ontology, clonal families are defined by the generation of B cells from a common progenitor selected and expanded by the ongoing immune response. In other words, B cells express high-affinity antibodies that enable them to 'out-compete' other B cells in the germinal centre for antigen and growth factors during affinity maturation. 14,15 Furthermore, cross-patient analysis of antibody repertoires of individuals with a common immune phenotype has proven a powerful method of identifying shared IgH V(D)J and IgL VJ that encode antibodies with functional activity at an increased frequency as compared to identification of clonal families alone. 51, 65, 93 ",

In studying the antibody response to influenza vaccination with a cell-barcoding approach (Figure 2b) , investigators in my laboratory found that large clonal families encode antibodies that bind to influenza hemagglutinin with higher affinities, and in certain cases are more effective at neutralizing influenza virus than antibodies that are not part of large clonal families. 34 PCR bias, in which certain templates amplify more efficiently than other templates, can distort clonal proportions. 96 In addition, activated B cells, such as plasmablasts, express as much as 100-fold more RNA than memory B cells and other resting B cells, 97 which in the absence of cell-based barcoding 27 or amplification within emulsion droplets 98 might suggest artificial differences in clonal proportions.

Most approaches require prior knowledge of the target antigen, which is used for screening vast numbers of hybridomas, B cells or panels of candidate antibodies. 115 Antibody repertoire sequencing, by contrast, does not require such knowledge. When applied to plasmablasts derived from a human or other animal with an immune phenotype of interest, this method enables the bioinformatic identification of clonal families of antibodies within a functional B-cell response without having to express or screen the antibodies. Such clonal antibody families define important antigens, as determined by the immune response. Recombinant antibodies generated from plasmablast clonal families can be used to identify the antigenic specificity of these cells. Such antigen discovery can uncover not only the targets of antibodies but also those of T cells, because B cells and T cells coordinate responses against the same macromolecular antigen complexes. 116 Comprehensive datasets generated by large-scale sequencing of antibody repertoires, in combination with identification of the corresponding antigen targets of important antibodies, is anticipated to enable bioinformatic modelling of antibody-antigen structure-binding relationships that will ultimately lead to antibody variable region sequences being used to predict antibody specificity.",

B cells undergo clonal expansion and affinity maturation after encountering antigen and T-cell help or co-stimulatory signals, a process that generally occurs in germinal centres within secondary lymphoid organs. 12, 13 Affinity maturation involves two processes, somatic hypermutation and clonal selection. Somatic hypermutation is a cytidine-deaminase-mediated process in which antibody CDRs are mutated ~1-2 times per cell division. Clonal selection involves competition of B cells for antigen and growth factors in germinal centres, resulting in B cells that express the highest-affinity antibodies being selected to expand and survive. 12, 13 After multiple rounds of somatic hypermutation and clonal selection, antibody-expressing B cells produce antibodies with increased affinity for their target antigen. 10 B cells that express high-affinity antibodies respond further to growth factors and other signals that induce differentiation into plasmablasts and memory B cells. 11, 14, 15 Plasmablasts transiently circulate in the blood and migrate to secondary lymphoid organs and tissues involved in the disease process, including tissues under autoimmune, infectious or malignant attack. Memory B cells circulate in the blood, and enable rapid recall responses upon re-exposure to their target antigen, whereas plasma cells localize primarily in the bone marrow and lamina propria, where they secrete antibodies. Abbreviation: CDRs, complementarity determining regions; FDC, follicular dendritic cell. Phylogenetic tree of the antibody repertoire. Example of a phylogenetic tree of a human plasmablast response generated using cell barcoding. Phylogenetic trees reveal clonal families and guide the expression and screening of the identified antibodies. Each major branch represents a single IgH V(D)J, outer branching is determined by the IgL VJ sequence, and each terminal leaf represents the error-corrected, full-length, paired IgH and IgL sequences expressed by an individual B cell. Clonal families (colour coded) contain antibodies that share IgH VJ and IgL VJ sequences. Immunodominant (red) and rare (other colours) families are identified. Single nucleotide substitutions can substantially alter antibody binding specificity and affinity 117 , and in order to evaluate the spectrum of antibodies encoded within each clonal family recombinant antibodies representing the range of variants represented within each family should be expressed and characterized.

Cell barcodes enable binning of the IgH and IgL chain reads from each B cell, thereby providing accurate determination of clonal proportions. By contrast, molecular barcodes do not enable RT-PCR error correction, IgH and IgL pairing, analysis of coexpressed genes or accurate determination of clonal proportions.Robinson   Page 22Nat Rev Rheumatol.

Single B cells are sorted, the template switching activity of RT adds a unique cell-specific barcode to all cDNAs generated from an individual B cell. Plate-specific barcodes are then added, resulting in cDNAs that have compound cell barcodes.
