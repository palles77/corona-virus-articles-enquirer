            "text": "To the Editor: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly described parvovirus for which pathogenic potential has not clearly been elucidated (1) . Recent fi ndings suggest that HBoV may establish persistent infection of mucosal lymphocytes or contribute to tonsillar hyperplasia in children (2) . In previous reports, we described prolonged HBoV DNA detection in immunocompromised children (3, 4) . Partial sequencing of the VP1 gene of HBoV from bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid, plasma, and sphenoid sinus samples showed 100% identity, which suggested persistence of the same HBoV strain over a 5-month period (3) . It remains speculative, however, whether paranasal sinus mucosa represents a site of HBoV persistence. To clarify this, we analyzed samples of paranasal mucosal tissue and nasal polyps from patients with chronic sinusitis for respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria.",

Moreover, the fact that no HBoV DNA was detected in nasal swabs or EDTAblood samples indicates no active HBoV infection. In previous studies, HBoV DNA was frequently identifi ed in the adenoids and tonsils of children (2, 5, 10) . However, in contrast with our fi ndings, detection of HBoV was mostly associated with other viruses, suggesting that co-virus-induced cellular damage might contribute to bocavirus reactivation and replication (5) . Our fi ndings indicate that persistence of viral nucleic acid in sinus mucosa might be a special advantage of HBoV, although the relevance of this observation remains unclear. Whether this presence as a single virus means a dead end for HBoV infection, true latency including the potential of reactivation, or a role in the pathogenesis of clinical conditions requiring surgery warrants future studies.",

To provide evidence that the QIAGEN RNeasy kit is also suitable for DNA extraction, we spiked HBoV negative samples with different amounts of HBoV DNA before extraction of nucleic acids was done with either the QIAGEN RNeasy Kit or DNA Blood Kit (QIAGEN). Extracted nucleic acids were then subjected to real-time PCR by using primers specifi c for HBoV. Minimal differences (\u00b11 cycle threshold [C t ] value) in the HBoV PCR were detected; the QIAGEN RNeasy Kit was therefore used throughout the study (data not shown). Nasal swabs and EDTA-blood were purifi ed by using a QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (QIAGEN). Multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses (Fast-track Diagnostics, Junglinster, Luxembourg) was conducted to detect infl uenza A different mucosal samples were tested and gave identical results. No multiple viral infections and no bacteria were detected. Median patient age was 51.2 years (range 14.4-74.2 years) for HBoV-positive and 47.6 years (range 13.3-88.1 years) for HBoV-negative samples. C t analysis in single real-",

            "text": "To the Editor: The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is high (8% of the population) in Pakistan (1). HCV is an RNA virus that has a high mutation rate. This high rate results in extensive genetic heterogeneity, and HCV isolates are found as either quasispecies or genotypes (2) . Humans can be co-infected with >1 genotype (mixed genotype infection) of this virus (3) . The rate of HCV mixed genotype infections is extremely variable for different regions and for the same group of patients tested by using different assays (4). Thus, it is diffi cult to determine the prevalence of mixed genotype infections by currently available assays, including direct DNA sequencing, because they are designed to identify only the HCV genotype dominant in that particular population. Consequently, genotypes present at lower frequencies could be missed or mistyped (5) .To determine the prevalence of HCV mixed genotype infections, we retrospectively analyzed genotyping data for paired serum samples from 22,125 HCV-infected patients during the past 11 years (March 2000-May 2010) for all regions in Pakistan by using molecular-based genotypespecifi c methods (6, 7) . A total of 12,036 (54.4%) were male patients and 10,089 (45.6%) were female patients.",
