State-of-art molecular methods such as randomly primed PCR combined with massive parallel sequencing (MPS) or microarrays may open new perspectives in extraneous agent testing. The robustness and efficacy of this technical approach in vaccine control was clearly demonstrated on a human vaccine example when porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) contamination was revealed in Rotarix, a human rotavirus vaccine.

            "text": "Contrary to all unequivocal advantages of vaccines and vaccination, both the past and the presence offer several examples when a certain vaccine was contaminated [8] . Foamy virus (Spumaretroviridae) was identified as a contaminant of primary monkey kidney cultures used for vaccine production in the early 1950s. The virus causes a foam-like syncytial effect in cell cultures leading to cell lysis and destruction of cell cultures. However, they do not cause any clinical symptoms in vivo. Infected animals induce lifelong persistent infection [11] . In the 1960s it was shown that yellow fever live attenuated vaccines prepared in chicken embryo fibroblasts were infected with avian leukosis virus (ALV) [12] . Nevertheless, no increased risk for cancer was observed in vaccinated individuals, which was expected considering that ALV does not grow efficiently in mammalian cells [13e15] . Calicivirus was found in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [16] . Jorgensen et al. [17] revealed Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine strains in different live poultry vaccines, while in 1990 a live attenuated multi-component canine vaccine was contaminated with a serotype of bluetongue virus causing abortions and death in pregnant bitches [18, 19] . Pestiviruses (BVDV types 1 and 2) are one of the most common EAs in veterinary and human vaccines [20e22, 24, 25] . The potential source of pestivirus in live vaccines prepared for human and veterinary use may be the use of FCS, which is applied for growing the cells during vaccine production [23] . As a further threat besides BVDV type 1 and 2 novel bovine pestiviruses (BVDV 3) were also detected in foetal calf serum used by diagnostic laboratories and bioindustry. These batches usually originated from Brazil, while contaminated bovine serum samples came from Thailand [26e29]. The diagnostic problem posed by novel bovine pestiviruses is primer sets designed to BVDV 1 and 2 usually fail to detect BVDV 3 sequences.",

Information should be collected about the geographic location of the facility, quality of facilities/laboratories, quality and health status of personnel and consolidated data from epidemiological monitoring concerning the status of epizootic/enzootic diseases in the geographic origin of the starting materials. All this can lead to a reduction in the number of EAs, which should be tested within the production process. Furthermore it would be essential to define the steps of the manufacturing process where molecular methods can be applied. The reduction in number of EAs and the increasing use of molecular methods instead of traditional animal testing are in profound concordance with '3R's rule as reduce, refine and replace animal testing in the manufacture and testing of veterinary medicinal products, which also recognised by Ph. Eur (see chapter 1.1) [7] . The Ph.

To minimise such risk and ensure high quality and safe vaccines have a profound importance. State-of-art molecular methods like metagenomics and microarrays can improve the capacity of both manufacturers and competent authorities to reveal contaminations and to identify the well-known and the potentially new EAs. The implementation of these methods into routine tests of vaccines and their acceptance by Ph. Eur. or EMA as official methods need validation. A further requirement of the acceptance is to improve interpretation of results obtained by these tests especially in comparison with those obtained by currently mandated tests. A past example underlines that the improved ability to screen vaccines for contamination has a direct relation to the improvement of vaccine quality and safety. Subsequently SV40 had been revealed in vaccines, manufacturers were requested by control authorities to test for the presence of SV40, which led to the full clearance of SV40 from vaccine batches released after 1961.",
