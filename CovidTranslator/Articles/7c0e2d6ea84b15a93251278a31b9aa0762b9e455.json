The gene for the enzyme was cloned in the absence of purification tags, expressed in Escherichia coli and the enzyme purified. Enzyme activity from the SARS CoV main proteinase dimer could readily be detected at low pM concentrations. The enzyme exhibited a high K m , and is unusually sensitive to ionic strength and reducing agents.",

A coronavirus was identified as the major cause of SARS [1, 2] . The genome of the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV), a positive-stranded RNA virus, has been sequenced [3, 4] . The SARS coronavirus replicase gene contains two overlapping translation products, polyprotein 1a ($450 kDa) and polyprotein 1ab ($750 kDa). The polyproteins are cleaved by viruscoded proteinases, one of which is the 3C-like or SARS CoV main proteinase, a cysteine proteinase with a chymotrypsinlike fold [5] . Prevention of the proteolytic processing of coronavirus replicase polyproteins inhibits the production of infectious virus particles [6] , and for this reason the SARS CoV main proteinase is an attractive target for antiviral agents. However, before potential inhibitors can be screened, a sensitive and quantitative assay for enzyme activity must be developed.",

Upon cleavage by an endoproteinase of one of the two amide bonds adjacent to the Rhodamine moiety, the Rhodamine moiety in the resultant mono-substituted product switches to the quinone state exhibiting a high degree of conjugation; concomitant with this is a massive increase in fluorescence intensity.

The mono-substituted product absorbs around 490 nm, because the Rhodamine-moiety is in the quinone state. Ala-Arg-Leu-Gln-NH-Rhodamine exhibits two, overlapping absorbance peaks with maxima at 469 and 492 nm, whereas Rhodamine 110 has a single absorbance peak at 496 nm. One interpretation for the origin of the split peak in the mono-substituted product is: The bis-substituted substrate is not symmetrical; cleavage of one bond on (Ala-Arg-Leu-Gln-NH) 2 -Rhodamine may give rise to a species that absorbs slightly differently than if cleavage occurred at the other amide bond.",

The absorption spectrum in (A) indicates (Ala-Arg-Leu-Gln-NH) 2 -Rhodamine does not absorb between 460 and 500 nm, therefore the Rhodamine moiety is drawn in the lactone state. Upon hydrolysis by the SARS CoV main proteinase, the product, in (B), absorbs strongly between 460 and 500 nm, therefore the Rhodamine moiety is drawn in the quinone state. aries of the gene were 3241Lys-Gln3240 [19] . The gene was ligated into pET11d plasmid and the resultant plasmid electroporated into TOP10 cells for propagation. Finally, the pET11d-SARS plasmid was transformed into electrocompetent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. For expression, the BL21(DE3) cells were grown overnight in autoinduction medium [20] . A large amount of the enzyme appeared in the supernatant after centrifugation of the cell lysate, Fig. 2 . The soluble proteinase in the supernatant flowed through a strong cation column connected in series to a strong anion column. The last step in the purification procedure was to apply that flow through to a different strong anion column. The weakly bound enzyme eluted at a low salt concentration. The cell extract must be very dilute in order for the enzyme to bind to the POROS 50HQ column. At this stage, the enzyme was estimated to be greater than 98% pure. The enzyme is difficult to purify because it has a pI of 6.2 with a net negative charge density of only 3. Its molecular mass determined by Maldi was 33 759; this indicates that N-terminal methionine was missing.",

They are particularly useful in the neutral to basic pH range where the output from a xenon lamp is relatively high and where interference from most biological compounds is low. They are specific substrates whose specificity is further enhanced upon cleavage of a single amide bond, because the fluorophore undergoes conversion from the lactone to the quinone state. This process is accompanied by an increase in the de- gree of conjugation and hence stability which leads to an enhancement of the reactivity of the susceptible bonds in the substrate. They are selective substrates because their structure mimics the amino acid sequence in the reactive site of a proteinase's natural substrate.",

However, this is probably a reflection of the enzyme and not the substrate. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrates have been used to measure the enzymatic activity of the SARS CoV main proteinase. They have yielded K m values ranging from 404 to 16 lM [23, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . With EDANS-VNSTLQSGLRK-Dabs, the K m is 404 lM and the k cat is 1.08 min \u00c01 [26] , quite similar to the numbers we obtained with the Rhodamine-based substrate. With Abz-TSAVLQSGFRK-DNP, the K m is 253 lM and the k cat is 0.3 min \u00c01 [29] . The FRET substrates not only contain the P1 and P1 0 amino acids, but, they also contain 5 amino acids before and after the cleavage site; thus, those substrates should occupy almost all of the specificity pockets in the enzyme. Although the Rhodaminebased substrates do not contain amino acids on the C-terminal side of the cleavage site and hence do not occupy those specificity pockets, this apparently does not matter in terms of kinetic constants that can be obtained.",

            "text": "The experiments to optimize assay conditions revealed several interesting characteristics of the SARS CoV main proteinase. The data points in the experiment in Fig. 4A where enzyme activity was plotted as a function of pH could best be fit to a model system with two ionizable groups, pK a values of 6.8 and 8.7, and an optimal pH of 8. With the archetype cysteine proteinase papain, k cat /K m values as a function of pH exhibit a bell-shaped curve with a pH optimum of 6-7 and pK a values of 3.3 for Cys25, and 8.3 for His159 [31] . On the other hand, the structure of the rhinovirus 2A proteinase [32] which is structurally similar to the SARS CoV main proteinase [5, 33] also exhibits a bell-shaped k cat /K m versus pH curve but with an optimum pH of 8 and pK a values of 7.34 for Cys106 and 8.54 for His28 [34] . The activity of the SARS CoV main proteinase was unusually insensitive to temperature. The optimal temperature was about 42\u00b0C, but enzyme activity only increased by 37% between 25 and 37\u00b0C. In contrast, the adenovirus proteinase which is also a cysteine proteinase has a temperature optimum of 45\u00b0C, and enzyme activity increases 4-fold between 25 and 37\u00b0C [11] . The SARS CoV main proteinase activity was very sensitive to ionic strength in that 80% of enzyme activity is lost by the presence of 100 mM NaCl. In contrast, the activity of the adenovirus proteinase in the absence of a nucleic acid cofactor is very insensitive to ionic strength. It has been postulated that there may be a salt bridge between Glu166 in the SARS CoV main proteinase and the P3 amino acid in the substrate if it is positively charged [25] . Perhaps this is why enzyme activity is so sensitive to ionic strength.",

The crystal structure of the 3C-like proteinase from transmissible gastroenteritis virus [33] and from human coronavirus [5] is that of a dimer. And evidence has been published that indicates the dimer is the functional form of the enzyme [18, 23, 35] . We have characterized the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the SARS CoV main proteinase by small-angle X-ray scattering, chemical cross linking, and enzyme kinetics and determined that the equilibrium dissociation constant is 6.8 lM (Graziano et al., manuscript in preparation). This number was used to calculate the dimer concentration in Fig. 6 . The substrate concentration in the experiment in Fig. 6 was 20 lM; since the K m was 306 lM, the results of this experiment imply that if one were to assay the SARS CoV main proteinase at a substrate concentration equal to the K m , enzyme activity from as low a concentration as 66 pM SARS CoV main proteinase dimer could be quantitatively observed.",

The data are shown in Fig. 5, a plot of the rate of substrate hydrolysis versus the substrate concentration. The rate of substrate hydrolysis at lower substrate concentrations was proportional to the concentration of substrate. At higher con-centrations of substrate, the rate of hydrolysis approached saturation. The data could be fit to the classic Michaelis-Menten hyperbola, the solid line.
