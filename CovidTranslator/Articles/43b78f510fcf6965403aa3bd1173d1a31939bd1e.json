A recombinant partial nucleocapsid protein of SARSassociated coronavirus was used as a serodiagnostic antigen in the ELISA. A total of 2892 clinical serum samples were tested with the ELISA kit, which positively identified 25 of 35 (71.4%) samples of patients with confirmed SARS infection, 286 of 407 (70%) samples of patients suspected of having SARS, 229 of 302 (75.8%) samples of convalescent SARS patients, and 0 of 544 samples obtained from healthcare workers; only 1 of 1604 clinical samples obtained from patients with other diseases demonstrated a weakly positive result. These results indicate that the double-antigen sandwich ELISA is an effective screening method for the serodiagnosis of SARS-associated coronavirus.",

Previous research showed it has a variety of functions, including participation in the transcription and replication of viral RNA, and interference with cell cycle processes of host cells [4] . Moreover, in many coronaviruses, the nucleocapsid protein has high immunogenic activity and is abundantly overexpressed during infection [5] . All of these factors suggest that the nucleocapsid protein may be a potential source of a diagnostic antigen for detecting SARS infection, and many diagnostic methods have been developed based on the nucleocapsid protein [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In order to develop a recombinant protein for use as the coated antigen and enzyme-conjugated antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV, we used the expression and purification of a partial nucleocapsid protein of SARSassociated coronavirus. The double-antigen sandwich assay we developed was then used to test 2892 clinical serum samples, and the results are presented here.",

            "text": "To prepare HRP-antigen conjugates with high activity for the sandwich ELISA, GST-N and GST-N-4K were coupled with HRP, and a HRP-antigen conjugate with high activity was chosen from them. The activity of the conjugate was determined by the mole ratio of HRP to antigen and the valence of the conjugate. As calculated by OD405/OD280, the mole ratio of GST-N-HRP conjugate was 0.98\u00b10.08, while that of GST-N-4K-HRP conjugate was 1.45\u00b10.16. The p value was calculated as 0.021 using Student's t-test, which showed that the binding capacity of GST-N-4K-HRP conjugate was better. The valence of GST-N-HRP and GST-N-4K-HRP, as determined by checkerboard titration, was 1:500 (about 1 \u00b5g/ml) and 1:1000 (about 0.5 \u00b5g/ml), respectively. Since the results indicated that GST-N-4K-HRP conjugate was better for the sandwich ELISA, this conjugate was used in the ELISA. HRP reacted with primary amine in the antigen, and the number of primary amines can affect the efficiency [13] . In order to increase the binding capacity of antigen to HRP, the antigen GST-N-4K was designed, which has four more lysines in the C-terminal than GST-N. The four extra lysines increased the number of primary amines, and GST-N-4K showed a higher binding capacity than GST-N in the reaction with HRP.",

Each of the 18 positive sera produced an OD between 0.354 and 2.398, all of which were greater than the cutoff point, and all 20 negative sera gave an OD below 0.15 (0.058\u00b10.030).

Analysis of these results obtained with clinical samples reveals good specificity of the ELISA. Although the percentage of samples that tested positive with the ELISA was about 70%, this may be due to the inclusion of some samples from patients who had been misdiagnosed with SARS. During the SARS outbreak, misdiagnosis occurred frequently in efforts to prevent further spread of the disease. Among the specimens from patients suspected of having SARS, some may have been collected from patients who were not actually infected. Unfortunately, it was not possible for us to follow up all of those patients and their samples, which were collected at various times during the outbreak; thus, we are not sure how many patients in this group were eventually excluded. However, the eight cases we knew were excluded and were placed in a separate group, and the ELISA produced negative results for all of these patients.",

While the number of cases is too small for statistical analysis, our results are, to a certain extent, in accordance with the previous report [15] .

In this trial, the percentage of cases detected by real-time PCR was unsatisfactory, even for samples obtained during the early stage of illness. This may be due to inefficient isolation of nucleic acid and nonstandard sampling that possibly resulted in reduced levels of RNA. In our primary trials with protein microarray (data not shown), the nucleocapsid protein, especially the second half, which is located at 213aa-423aa of the C-terminal of this protein, showed strong antigenicity. Our use of this polypeptide as an antigen in the development of our double-antigen sandwich ELISA for detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV in serum was based on this finding. This double-antigen sandwich ELISA, which employs recombinant N protein as the serodiagnostic antigen and uses enzyme-conjugated antigen instead of enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody, provides a safe, specific, and sensitive means of detecting or confirming SARS infection.",
