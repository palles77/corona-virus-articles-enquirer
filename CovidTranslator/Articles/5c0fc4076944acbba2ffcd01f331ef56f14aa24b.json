Bei and his colleagues helped to build the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in the 1950s (FIG.1 (TIMELINE) ), and he later became the first director of the Institute of Biophysics (IBP) in 1958. Landmark achievements of Chinese cell biologists in the 1960s and 1970s include the first demonstration of asexual reproduction in amphibian s by Xi Zhu (Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology (SICB), CAS) 1 , and the establishment of the first human liver cancer cell line by Ruiming Chen at the same institute 2 .",

The political movements also set all scientific research curricula back during this period, until China opened its door to the West in the 1980s. In the next two decades, a large population of Chinese students and scholars went abroad to study modern sciences, including MCB. Although these scholars made great discoveries overseas, the development of MCB research in China remained slow-paced due to the lack of expertise, resources and financial support.",

The CSCB has played an increasingly important part in advancing MCB research in China by organizing biennial national meetings, sponsoring special conferences and workshops on selective topic s and advocating the need for initiating specific research and funding programmes for emerging scientific areas. This Essay highlights the current organization of MCB research programmes in China, funding opportunities and application procedures, career development initiatives for Chinese scientists returning from abroad and for foreign scholars, as well as the opportunities for scientific collaborations.",

The fast-growing economy over the past decade was the powerhouse for the rapid development of innovative MCB research, both basic and translational, in China. Over the past decade, on average there has been a more than 10% annual increase in research funding support from two major Chinese research fundin g agencies, the National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST). As a result, scientists in China have made a number of major contributions to the field of MCB during this time. Examples include the delineation of the molecular mechanisms underlying \u03b2-arrestin signalling [3] [4] [5] , bacteri a-host and virus-host cell inter actions 6-9 , necroptosi s 10,11 , DNA hydroxylation and demethylation 12, 13 , autophagy plasticity and its regulation by protein acetylation [14] [15] [16] , the role of acetylation in cellular metabolism 17, 18 and the induction of pluripotency 19, 20 . The creatio n of androgenetic haploid embryonic stem (AG-haES) cells and their application in the generation of genetically modified mice 21, 22 , as well as the functional delineation of cellular plasticity and homeostasis regulators based on structural insights, has also been achieved by MCB researchers in China [23] [24] [25] .",

Recently, the NIH has jointly awarded grants with the NSFC for collaborative projects related to cancer, allergies, immunology and infectious diseases, using supplemental mechanisms that provide additional funding for joint studie s (see NIH funding opportunities and notices). In addition, grants are available for international collaborations; such applications should be initiated and submitted by Chinese investigators and the proposed project projects should be based on hypothesis-driven research with potential synergism from overseas partners. In general, there are specific milestone requirements for these collaboration grants. The timely and joint publication in high impact journals is essential for renewals. Typically, this is a 5-year grant with an annual budget of 100,000 US dollars to support expenses related to scientific exchange and technology transfer. In addition, bilateral collaboration grants are available that are awarded through a request for applications procedure. For this type of grant, both the Chinese investigator and the foreign collaborator should write and submit their applications to the NSFC and the respective co-sponsoring agency in the country of the collaborator. In general, the NSFC provides funding support to the Chinese applicants and finances travel in both directions between the awardees and their foreign collaborators, while funding from the collaborators' country supports their research and travel expenses for scientific exchanges. The criteria for funding this type of joint venture are based on the merit of the collaboration, which is assessed individually on both sides by the respective funding agencies. Following peer-review, the NSFC and the partner funding agencies will finalize the awardees for bilateral co llaborations. The typical 5-year programme requires annual exchange visits, one scientific workshop or conference per funding cycle to train young scholars and joint peer-reviewed publications on the proposed project. This type of joint grant can be renewed upon its successful completion. Typically, guidelines for the aforementioned grant applications are published on the NSFC website in late December, with a due date for applications in mid-March of the following year.",

In recent years, the initiative of developing China's own brand-name international journals has received increasing support from multiple parties, including governmental agencies, local institutions and the broad community of scientists. As a result, premium international journals are starting to emerge from China, a prominent example of which is Cell Research. This journal has an impact factor that is competitive with key international journals and it is co-sponsored by the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (IBCB), Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences (SIBS), CAS and CSCB.

Administratively, MCB research could be further promoted by implementing new strategies such as merit-based competitiv e grant renewals for the most successful projects. This would avoid a 1-year gap in funding for such researchers and also the time spent on the application process; funding sources such as the 973, 863 and NSFC key projects require a second level of peer-review which consists of giving an oral presentation in front of a scientific panel. If merit-based competitive grant renewals were in place, principle investigators could file competitive renewals 1 year ahead of the completion of the project. In addition, it would be costeffective and productive if a 1-year extension that does not require the award of any new funding could be granted to researchers so that they don't have to rush to spend the remaining funds towards the end of a 5-year grant.",

Twenty institutes that have MCB research as part of their research portfolios are under the wing of the CAS, and a number of key national laboratories are within and across these institutes. The institutes under the CAS are located throughout China, although a higher number of them are in Beijing and Shanghai. Some of the institutes possessing active MCB programmes under the CAS are listed in FIG. 2, and a full list can be found on the CAS website. The second stream of MCB research is governed by the Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE). Most research universities started building their MCB programmes around 5 years ago, and they have attracted a large number of young talents under central government initiatives such as the 'Thousand Talent' and 'Young Thousand Talent' projects. The initial plan under the Young Thousand Talent project aims to recruit thousands of rising scientific 'stars' who are under the age of 35 but have more than 4 consecutive years of work experience abroad. Some of the major universities that conduct MCB research and have the relevant educational curriculum are shown in FIG. 2, and a full list can also be found on the MOE's website. The birth of the National Institute of Biological Sciences (NIBS) in Beijing in April 2003 represents a new model system for conducting world-class MCB research in China. Aimed at understanding the fundamental mechanisms of life and educating new generations of life scientists, the NIBS uses a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Janelia Farm Research Campus format to host young talents that perform E S S AY In focus: molecular and cell biology research in China Xuebiao Yao, Dangsheng Li and Gang Pei",

Nature Reviews | Molecular Cell Biology physics, mathematics and biology. It would be useful to form and/ or create world-class research centres that provide a collaborative, inter disciplinary environment to pursue the most challenging problems in MCB, much like the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Janelia Farm Campus in the United States and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan. Scientific committees consisting of distinguished international scientists could also be deployed to provide scientifi c input and evaluation every 3-5 years. However, very few MCB programmes across the nation have an active international advisory committee. The recently established Protein Science Centres in Shanghai and Beijing represent a great opportunity for achieving a more efficient organization of the country's scientific research programmes, as they are a great resource for supporting the MCB research community in China by providing visiting scholar programmes and core facilities.",
