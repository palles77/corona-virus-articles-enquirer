Moreover, the epidemiological and biological characteristics of these viruses are relatively similar. When SARS broke out in China, researchers found that the virus could survive in feces for over 96 hours [3] . Similarly, studies on SARS-CoV-2 revealed that live viral strains could be isolated from feces, thus indicating the potential infectiousness of this body waste [4] . Further research found that different specimens express different results at different stages of the disease. For example, a report indicated that specimens obtained from the respiratory tract are more likely to yield viral RNA in the early stages of illness than other specimens. However, this likelihood gradually decreased after the first week of onset. The same report further found that stool specimens are 100% positive on the third week after onset and 30% positive 29 days later [5] . Recent data from China revealed that sputum shows the highest positive RT-PCR rates. Viral nucleic acids could be positively detected in 10% of the patients' blood samples at the acute period and in 50% of the patients' feces [4] . These studies infer that live viruses and viral nucleic acids could be detected in stool. Moreover, compared with respiratory specimens, stool specimens may remain positive longer, similar to the findings of the present study.",

We analyzed the possible causes of this finding and recommend that a negative stool sample be included in a patient's discharge criteria. Introduction: In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. The infection spread very quickly throughout China and over 100 countries. To date, over 100,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide and at least 3,000 patients have died.",

More interestingly, besides these patients, a boy showed a positive result in his stool 3 weeks after close contact with his father, a confirmed patient. However, all other samples (i.e., nasal swab, throat swab, and stool) of the boy had been negative for the past 3 weeks. These findings indicate that the stool specimens of children remain positive for a longer time than those of adults. In the present work, we analyzed possible reasons behind time PCR was conducted by using the SARS-CoV-2 (ORF1ab/N) nucleic acid detection kit (Bio-germ, Shanghai, China). The following primers and probe were used: forward primer, were 50 \u00b0C for 15 min and 95 \u00b0C for 3 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 30 s.",

Three children and one adult showed positive results in their stool 4 weeks after onset. Discussion: This study found viral shedding in the feces of eight patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, six of whom were children. Thus, we first sought to determine whether patients shed SARS-CoV-2 in stool. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. To date, six CoVs are known to cause human infection. Of these CoVs, two zoonotic viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were responsible for serious outbreaks in China in 2002-2003 (SARS-CoV) and in the Middle East in 2012 (MERS-CoV). The 2019-nCoV virus is closely related to SARS-CoV",

Because we only presented eight patients with mild to moderate infection, the data obtained may not be generalizable to all cases, especially severe ones.Second, lopinavir/ritonavir was used only in adult patients; as such, its role in children cannot be determined. Third, we cannot estimate the exact time at which the patients were exposed to the virus and when theybegan to shed the virus in their feces. Such data are urgently needed to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus better and implement the necessary control strategies as early as possible. The results of the present study revealed the novel finding that SARS-CoV-2 can be shed in the stool of some convalescent-phase patients. Thus, discharge criteria should be carefully evaluated, especially among children. Discharge of patients still infected with SARS-CoV-2 could increase the risk of infection to the public. Thus, patients should be released only after all their specimens are negative to reduce possible infection. Our results enhance the current knowledge on this emerging infectious disease and offer implications for clinical diagnostics and infection control.",
