In this review, we summarize the repertoire of methods currently being applied and report recent progress in the field of in silico annotation of protein function based on the accumulation of vast amounts of sequence and structure data. In particular, we emphasize the newly developed structure-based methods, which are able to identify locally structural motifs and reveal their relationship with protein functions. These methods include computational tools to identify the structural motifs and reveal the strong relationship between these pre-computed local structures and protein functions. We also discuss remaining problems and possible directions for this exciting and challenging area.",

A fundamental goal of functional genomics research is to understand how proteins carry out functions in a living cell (Eisenberg et al. 2000; Brenner 2001; Goldsmith-Fischman and Honig 2003) . In addition to experimental methods, computational methods have been extensively applied with the aim of developing hypotheses in terms of assigning specific functions to specific proteins and providing valuable biological insights. The basic rationale behind such research is that the gene sequence determines the amino acid sequence, and the amino acid sequence determines the protein structure, which, in turn, determines the protein function (Whisstock and Lesk 2003) . Many proteins, even among those in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), have not yet been annotated, although we have succeeded in deriving their structures Watson et al. 2005) . We review here the in silico annotation methods currently used to determine protein function from protein local structures.",

As such, they are the basic elements of functions. However, the definition of function means different things to different people since it is an evolving concept associated to an abundance of interpretations. In general, these functions can be described at many levels, ranging from the biochemical functions at the molecular level (e.g. catalytic or binding activities) to biological processes at the level of biomolecular cooperation (e.g. signal transduction or cellular physiological process) to the cellular components at the cell level of an organ (e.g. nucleus or rough endoplasmic) (Devos and Valencia 2000; Watson et al. 2005) . Several schemes/tools/ databases have been developed in recent decades for measuring protein functions in a systematic model with the aim of annotating the functions of proteins ; these include EC (Barrett 1997) , MIPS (Ruepp et al. 2004) , GO (The Gene Ontology Consortium 2000; Camon et al. 2004 ) and KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto 2000) , as shown in Table 1 .",

            "text": "\u2022 Using sequence information. The methods in this category often utilize a BLAST, FASTA or PSI-BLAST score to detect the sequence similarity and annotate the functions to a target protein from its homologous protein (Whisstock and Lesk 2003; Watson et al. 2005) . In the safe zone (Rost 1999 ) of sequence similarity, the sequence-based methods can provide putative annotations with high confidence (Wilson et al. 2000) . A number of papers have tested the global performance between the relationship of the sequence similarity and function similarity. Shah and Hunter (1997) tested the sequence similarity among enzymes in many EC classes at various thresholds and concluded that the functional similarity could not be detected perfectly when the sequences are not similar enough. Wilson et al. (2000) and Devos and Valencia (2000) obtained similar results. Joshi and Xu (2007) presented a systematic analysis on the sequencefunction relationships in four model organisms. \u2022 Using structure information. Protein structures are more conserved than protein sequences (Orengo et al. 1999; Hou et al. 2005) . A number of methods have been developed with the aim of assessing protein structure similarity (Kolodny et al. 2005) ; these can be grouped as coordinate-based [such as STRUCTAL (Gerstein and Levitt 1998) , SAMO , TM-align (Zhang and Skolnick 2005) and ProSup (Lackner et al. 2000) ], distance-matrix-based [such as DALI (Holm and Sander 1993) , CE (Shindyalov and Bourne 1998) , FATCAT (Ye and Godzik 2004) , SSAP (Orengo and Taylor 1996) ] and secondary-structure-based [such as VAST (Gibrat et al. 1996) , SSM (Krissinel and Henrick 2004) , LOCK (Singh and Brutlag 1997) and FAST (Zhu and Weng 2005) ]. Classifying the proteins into different classes or families based on global structure similarity will assist researchers in determining the relationships among different proteins and provide a foundation of functional organization (Brenner 2001) . SCOP (Murzin et al. 1995) , CATH (Orengo et al. 1997) and FSSP (Holm and Sander 1996) comprehensively cluster all proteins with known structures. Based on The safe zone means that pairwise sequence identity is higher than 40%, the twilight zone, about 20-30%, the midnight zone below 20% those clusters, the functional relationships among the proteins can be roughly detected. \u2022 Using interactome information. Proteins always interact with other molecules to carry out their functions (Sharan et al. 2007 ). Information on protein-protein interactions or other interaction maps among molecules, such as DNA binding with protein, can be explored to annotate the protein functions from complexes and pathways of the biochemical processes. The network-based methods extend the functional inference from the single molecular level to a systematic level by considering interactions among genetic components and transferring functions among them (Vazquez et al. 2003 ; Barabasi and Oltvai 2004; Zhang et al. 2007 ). Sharan et al. (2007) cataloged the methods to direct methods and module-assisted methods individually. \u2022 Using integrated information. Another sensible strategy is to use many different data sources to increase the chances of obtaining function annotations for any given protein. For example, in Marcotte et al. (1999) , proteins are grouped by experimental data, such as metabolic function, phylogenetic profiles, Rosetta stone results and correlated messenger RNA expression patterns to determine the functional relationships among proteins of the yeast. In fact, many methods are in this framework (Sanishvili et al. 2003; George et al. 2005; Pal and Eisenberg 2005; Zhao et al. 2008a, b) , especially when data integration becomes the focus of the systems biology study.",

            "text": "In this review we highlight the relationships between protein local structures and protein functions since it is commonly believed that local regions on the structures are responsible for the performance of the particular functional tasks (Russell 1998; Ferre et al. 2005) . Well-known examples include the Ser-His-Asp triad in enzymes and other known special structural frameworks that carry out certain functions of catalysis (Torrance et al. 2005) . It is now widely recognized that some fold similarities suggest an 'analogous' rather than a 'homologous' relationship (Russell 1998) . Proteins can adopt similar tertiary folds while performing different functions at different binding site locations. Given the existing status that the midnight zone functional linkages escape from the sequence and global structure similarity, only the local structures can be used to analyze detailed relationships with functions by determining the protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction or other global performance from the physical perspective. Also, the local structures of protein provide more detail information on protein function not only from the single targeted action of that protein, but also from the integrative process due to the detailed components and the three-dimensional architecture. The local structures are also important in the design of drugs and bioengineering. In an interesting paper, Schnell and Chou (2008) convincingly provided nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data showing that the M2 proton channel of influenza a virus is typically controlled by the local conformational change with a pHgated mechanism. The discovery provides sound evidence that the local structures are crucial for determining protein function, and it is vitally important in the search for effective anti-influenza drugs (Borman 2008) . Bridging protein local structures and protein functions can timely provide useful information for structure-based drug design [e.g. see the methods in Chou et al. (2003) and Wang et al. (2007a) against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and that in Du et al. (2007) against chicken influenza A virus H5N1, as well as a review paper (Chou 2004) ]. Thus, it a key task of researchers in this field is to investigate the relationships between protein functions and protein local structures. This review is organized into four parts. First, we will describe the main molecular functions related to protein local structures. This is followed by a description of existing definitions and methods for detecting similarities in local structures. In the third part, the detailed methodologies to bridge local structures with functions are reviewed. Some discussion and future directions are summarized in the last part.",

The pace of discovery of protein-protein interactions has recently accelerated due to rapid advances in new technologies (Salwinski and Eisenberg 2003; Chou and Cai 2006) . The basis of protein-protein interactions often lie in local planar patches on the protein surface. The factors that influence the formation of protein-protein complexes can be cataloged into four different types-i.e. homodimeric protein, heterodimeric proteins, enzyme-inhibitor complexes and antibody-protein complexes (Jones and Thornton 1996) . From the structural perspective, structural characterization of macromolecular assemblies usually poses a more difficult challenge than structure determination of individual proteins (Russell et al. 2004) . Effective approaches for the prediction of protein-protein interactions at physical interaction levels are also strongly in demand (Wodak and Mendez 2004) . Zhou and Qin (2007) reviewed the methods currently being applied for interface prediction. The characteristics between interface and noninterface portions of a protein surface, such as sequence conservation, proportions of amino acids, secondary structure, solvent accessibility and side-chain conformational entropy, are often used to distinguish the specificity of local structures relating to protein binding function.",

A comparison between protein-RNA and protein-DNA complexes revealed that while base and backbone contacts (both hydrogen bonding and van der Waals) are observed with equal frequency in protein-RNA complexes, backbone contacts are more dominant in protein-DNA complexes (Jones et al. 2001) .

Table 4 lists a number of methods currently used to identify local structure patterns. The procedure of recognition can be generally divided into two parts. The first is to construct the local structures. The geometric structure patterns and biochemical properties can be used to segment the protein architecture into small substructures. The second is to search the annotated sites from the literature and databases. The analysis of the protein surface is an active area of research in terms of the study of local structures. To date, two aspects of protein surface patches have attracted the most attention. The first is based on the defined features, such as surface curvature, surface cavities, electrostatic potential and hydrophobicity. CASTp (Binkowski et al. 2003b ) uses the weighted Delaunay triangulation and the alpha complex for shape measurements. The local regions are defined by computational geometry, which identifies and measures surface accessible pockets as well as interior inaccessible cavities for proteins and other molecules. Computational geometry also measures analytically the area and volume of each pocket and cavity, both in solvent accessible surface (SA, Richards' surface) and molecular surface (MS, Connolly's surface). CASTp provides an online resource for locating, delineating and measuring concave surface regions on the three-dimensional structures of proteins. These include pockets located on protein surfaces and voids buried in the interior of proteins. pvSOAR (Binkowski et al. 2004 ) provides an online resource to identify similar protein surface regions. Kinoshita and Nakamura (2003) provided a molecular surface database of proteins' functional sites, named the eF-site. The method displays the electrostatic potentials and hydrophobic properties of proteins together on the Connolly surfaces of the active sites for analysis of the molecular recognition mechanisms. The Connolly surfaces are made by using the Molecular Surface Package program, and the electrostatic potentials are calculated by solving Poisson-Boltzmann equations with the self-consistent boundary method. The second aspect of protein surface patches is based on a predefined segmentation size of the surface. The method uses a segmentation procedure to divide the surface into small segmentations that correspond to certain physical modules of the surface. SURFNET (Laskowski 1995) generates molecular surfaces and gaps between surfaces from three-dimensional coordinates supplied in a PDBformat file. The gap regions can correspond to the voids between two or more molecules or to the internal cavities and surface grooves within a single molecule. The program visualizes molecular surfaces, cavities and intermolecular interactions by segmenting the surfaces. Based on the SURFNET algorithm, SURFACE (Ferre et al. 2004) identifies clefts and explores the cleft boundaries called the surface patch. A non-redundant set of protein chains is then used to build a database of protein surface patches. LIG-SITE (Hendlich et al. 1997 ) is a program for the automatic and time-efficient detection of pockets on the surface of proteins that act as binding sites for small molecule ligands. Pockets are identified with a series of simple operations on a cubic grid.",

Some functional annotations of residues can be found in databases and the literature, and the location of these residues can be represented as potential structural motifs. Although it is difficult to define just precisely what is the active site in protein structures, there are a number of methods for identifying active sites or functionally important residues. Wallace et al. (1997) described a geometric hashing algorithm, called TESS, to derive three-dimensional coordinate templates for motifs. TESS has been used to create a database of enzyme active site templates called PROCAT (Wallace et al. 1997) . PROCAT provides facilities for interrogating a database of three-dimensional enzyme active site templates. It has been superseded by the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA). The CSA (Porter et al. 2004; Torrance et al. 2005 ) is a database documenting enzyme active sites and catalytic residues in enzymes with a threedimensional structure. It contains the original annotated entries derived from the primary literature by hand and the homologous entries found by the PSI-BLAST alignment. A HETATM and all annotated SITEs in the PDB also provide patterns of protein local structures strongly related to protein functions. Stark and Russell (2003a) reported patterns in non-homologous tertiary structures (PINTS) that can be used to uncover the recurring three-dimensional side-chain patterns based on the algorithm in Stark et al. (2003c) . SiteBase (Gold and Jackson 2006a) is a database of known ligand-binding sites within the PDB. The search for an annotated position in the PDB constructs the location information of the ligand-binding sites. A collection of known sites from mining the annotations in the PDB has been designated as the PDBSite (Ivanisenko et al. 2005) , which collects amino acid content structure features calculated by spatial protein structures, and physicochemical properties of sites and their spatial surroundings. The PDBSiteScan (Ivanisenko et al. 2004 ) provides an automatic search of three-dimensional protein fragments similar in structure to known functional sites.",

The program also has a unique capability to carry out ''fuzzy pattern matching'' with relax requirements on the types of some or all of the matching residues. RIGOR, on the other hand, can compare a database of pre-defined motifs against a perhaps newly determined structure. RIGOR scans a single protein structure for the occurrence of the pre-defined motifs from a database. Zemla (2003) presented a method for finding three-dimensional similarities in protein structure. This algorithm is able to generate different local superpositions between pairs of structures and to detect similar fragments. It allows the clustering of similar fragments and the use of such clusters to identify sequence patterns that represent local structure motifs. SUMO (Jambon et al. 2003) can detect the common site, which corresponds to the catalytic triad.",

In the unsupervised methods, the patterns are derived directly from a group of local structures without known functions. Their functional importance and characteristics are identified by analyzing the conserved factors in the common features of local structures.

The first is at the individual level and the second is at the mapping level. At the individual level, the protein can be represented as an interactive graph of the residues, with linkages representing the close distance among them. Cliques of the graph, hub residues and residues with other special topology measures may correspond to functionally important regions and residues. At the mapping level, a network represents the similarity relations among the local structures. The functional motifs are mined from informative subgraphs. This approach lies in between the other two methods mentioned above and can be regarded as being semi-supervised because it uses some heuristic knowledge.",

When similar local patterns of structures in some proteins are identified, the identified structure features of local regions will be the determinants of similar functions among the proteins. The second step is to match the process by comparing the target to the known functional templates. Based on the similarity between these, the function relationship is inferred. This method is also a basic tool for developing more advanced techniques to bridge the relationship between local structures and functions. The sequences, structures or other elements of the proteins are considered in the comparison. Table 5 lists the main methods that are currently being used.

Using multiple structure alignment, these authors also showed the correspondence between energy hot spots and structurally conserved residues. Three residues (Trp, Phe and Met) were observed to be significantly conservative in binding sites. These identified local structures are linked with binding functions. All residues in a protein are not equally important. Some are essential for certain structures or functions, whereas others can be readily replaced. Conservation analysis is one of the most widely used techniques for predicting these functionally important residues in protein sequences. Capra and Singh (2007) proposed a method focusing on the analysis of a multiple sequence alignment of the homologous sequences in order to find columns that are preferentially conserved. The results show that conservation is highly predictive in identifying catalytic sites and residues near bound ligands, while it is much less effective in identifying residues in protein-protein interfaces.",

The most basic form of the algorithm requires a multiple sequence alignment of a protein family and an evolutionary tree, based on sequence identity, which can approximate the functional classification of the protein sequences (Lichtarge and Sowa 2002) . Yao et al. (2003) proposed an automatic ET method that ranks the evolutionary importance of amino acids in protein sequences. This was the first method to quantify the significance of the overlap observed between the best-ranked residues and functional sites. The information inherent in a phylogenetic tree is added to the analysis of conserved sequences, often revealing the more subtle aspects of protein function. Starting with a multiple sequence alignment, a representative structure and a phylogenetic tree, this method evaluates conservation at each position in the alignment for different sequence similarity cut-offs. In its original implementation, residues were classified as variable, conserved or a group-specific set that is specific to one branch of the phylogenetic tree. This analysis can be further expanded by the use of amino acid substitution matrices to evaluate conservation. In either case, a representative structure is used to visualize the distribution of scores at the end of the analysis.",

This method requires a representative structure and a multiple sequence alignment as input data. Individual residues are represented in terms of regional alignments that reflect both their structural environment and their evolutionary variation, as defined by the alignment of homologous sequences. The overall and regional alignments are calculated from the global and regional similarity matrices, which contain scores for all pairwise sequence comparisons in the respective alignments. Three-dimensional clustering analysis is an easily applied method for the prediction of functionally relevant spatial clusters of residues in proteins. Armon et al. (2001) proposed the ConSurf method, which takes into account the evolutionary relationships among the sequence homologues by closely approximating the evolutionary process and by considering the phylogenetic relationships among the sequences and the similarity between amino acids. ConSurf maps evolutionary conserved regions on the surface of proteins with a known structure; it also aligns sequence homologues of the protein and uses the alignment to construct phylogenetic trees. The trees are then used to infer the presumed amino acid exchanges that occur throughout the evolution. Each exchange is then weighted by the physicochemical distance between the exchanged amino acid residues. The results show that the patches of conserved residues correlate well with the known functional regions of the domains and are more sensitive than the ET method.",

The identified functional motif can then be used as the structure template to detect the functional regions in other protein structures.

In addition, a measurement of the similarity to the template is used to assess the functional importance of the testing of local structures. Wallace et al. (1997) described a three-dimensional template matching method based on geometric hashing for automatically deriving three-dimensional templates from the protein structures deposited in PDB. In their paper, these researchers described a template derived for the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad. Their results showed that the resultant template provides a highly selective tool for automatically differentiating between catalytic and noncatalytic Ser-His-Asp associations. Goyal and Mande (2007) described the generation of three-dimensional structural motifs for metal-binding sites from known metalloproteins. Using three-residue templates and four-residue templates, the method scans all available protein structures in the PDB database for putative metalbinding sites. The search of the whole PDB database predicted many novel metal-binding sites, which are the identified functional motifs. Chakrabarti and Lanczycki (2007) recently performed a detailed survey of compositional and evolutionary constraints at the molecular and biological functional levels for a large set of known functionally important sites extracted from a wide range of protein families. They compared the degree of conservation across different functionally important sites. The compositional and evolutionary information at functionally important sites was compiled into a library of functional templates. In their paper, these researchers developed a module that predicts functionally important columns of an alignment based on the detection of a significant 'template match score' to a library template. Benchmark studies showed good sensitivity/ specificity for the prediction of functional sites and high accuracy in attributing correct molecular function type to the predicted sites.",

The high-scoring sites are more likely to be involved in specific binding or catalysis. Functionally important residues in a protein are known to be those computed to have energy among experimentally destabilized residues. Elcock (2001) proposed a method to predict functionally important residues based solely on the computed energetics of a protein structure. The energetic properties of binding surfaces in proteinprotein interfaces and protein-ligand sites were shown to be different (Burgoyne and Jackson 2006) . The pockets from Qsitefinder (Laurie and Jackson 2005) were ranked by the scores of these properties-i.e. hydrophobicity, desolvation, electrostatics and conservation-which are used to determine binding sites. Jones et al. (2003) developed a method to detect DNAbinding sites on a protein surface. The surface patches and the DNA-binding sites were initially analyzed for accessibility, electrostatic potential, residue propensity, hydrophobicity and residue conservation. In general, DNAbinding sites are among the top 10% of patches with the largest positive electrostatic scores. This knowledge was used to make predictions. Jones et al. (2001) presented a similar computational analysis of protein-RNA interactions. There are a number of differences between DNAbinding sites and RNA-binding sites. For the RNA-binding sites, van der Waals contacts play a more important role than hydrogen bond contacts. As to the protein-DNA binding local structures, Luscombe et al. (2001) investigated hydrogen bonds as well as van der Waals contacts and water-mediated bonds to assess whether there are universal rules that govern amino acid-base recognition.

Huang and Schroeder (2006) presented an extension and implementation method, LIGSITE csc , which is based on the notion of surface-solvent-surface events and the degree of conservation of the involved surface residues. The use of the Connolly surface has led to slight improvements, whereas the prediction re-ranking significantly improved the binding site predictions. Glaser et al. (2006) improved previous approaches by combining two known measures of 'functionality' in proteins, i.e. cleft volume and residue conservation, to develop a method for identifying the location of ligand-binding pockets in proteins. Neuvirth et al. (2004) proposed a structure-based algorithm to identify the location of protein-protein interaction sites. The sites are defined based on Connolly's molecular dot surfaces. The method defines an interface score that combines the chemical and geometry features of the interaction sites. Interfacial residues are considered to be those with the 10% highest scores. Geometry and energy properties have also been used to analyze the pocket functions for docking (Li et al. 2004 ). Hoskins et al. (2006) considered the use of solvent accessibility, residue propensity and hydrophobicity in conjunction with secondary structure data as prediction parameters to predict proteinprotein interaction sites. The influence of residue type and secondary structure on solvent accessibility is analyzed, and a measure of relative exposedness is defined. The highscoring residues are clustered as a basis for predicting interaction sites. Tsuchiya et al. (2004) provided a method for analyzing protein-DNA complexes, focusing on the shape of the molecular surface of the protein and DNA, along with the electrostatic potential on the surface, and calculated a new evaluation score. Based on the score, the method was used to classify DNA-binding from non-DNA-binding proteins. Taroni et al. (2000) provided an analysis of the characteristic properties of sugar-binding sites. For each site, six parameters were evaluated-i.e. solvation potential, residue propensity, hydrophobicity, planarity, protrusion and relative accessible surface area (ASA). Three of the parameters were found to distinguish the observed sugarbinding sites from the other surface patches. These parameters were then used to calculate the probability of a surface patch being a carbohydrate-binding site. The total score of the properties was used to determine whether the surface patch was a carbohydrate-binding site.",

The features can first be investigated in the learning process and used to detect whether these features relate some specific functions. Koike and Takagi (2004) proposed an SVM method to identify protein-protein interaction sites. The profiles of sequentially/spatially neighboring residues, plus additional information, constitute a feature vector, and the interaction site ratios are calculated by SVM regression. The predictive performance is evaluated and compared in different quantitative features. Cai et al. (2004) proposed an SVM algorithm to predict the catalytic triad of the serine hydrolase family. Bordner and Abagyan (2005) proposed a similar SVM to predict protein-protein interfaces. The local surface properties with a combination of an evolutionary conservation signal were used to train the machine on a large nonredundant data set of protein-protein interfaces. An SVM learning protocol was provided by Bhardwaj et al. (2005) for the prediction of DNA-binding proteins. The characteristics, including surface and overall composition, charge and positive potential patches on the protein surface, were derived, and the SVM was trained as a classifier to detect the DNA-binding proteins. The high accuracy value has been achieved in a large set of testing proteins regardless of their sequence or structure homology. Chung et al. (2007) recently exploited the SVM approach to detect whether identified potential proteinbinding sites interact with each other. The information related to sequence and structural complementary across protein interfaces were extracted from the PDB. This work also built a pipeline to predict the location of binding sites.",

(2003) presented an automatic neural network approach to predict NA-binding proteins, specifically DNA-binding proteins. This method uses an ensemble of features extracted from characterization of the structural and sequence properties of large, positively charged electrostatic patches. Structural and physical properties of DNA provide important constraints on the binding sites formed on the surfaces of the DNA-targeting proteins. The characteristics of DNA-binding sites may form the basis for predicting DNA-binding sites from the structures of proteins alone. Tjong and Zhou (2007) used a representative set of protein-DNA complexes from the PDB to analyze characteristics and to train a neural network predictor of DNA-binding sites. The input to the predictor consists of PSI-BLAST sequence profiles and solvent accessibility of each surface residue and 14 of its closest neighboring residues. Ferrer-Costa et al. (2005) provided a web-based method to detect if a protein structure contains a DNAbinding helix-turn-helix (DbHTH) motif. The method uses a neural network with no hidden layers, i.e. a linear predictor, to classify whether a protein is DNA-binding with the HTH motif. The linear predictor was trained on a nonhomologous set of 79 structures of protein chains with a DbHTH motif and 490 without the motifs. Sodhi et al. (2004) used a neural network to predict metal-binding sites residues in low-resolution structural models. The method involves sequence profile information combined with approximate structural data. Several neural networks were proposed to distinguish the metal sites from non-sites and then to detect these functionally important regions. In Keil et al. (2004) , the patches of the molecular surface were segmented into overlapping patches. The properties of these patches were calculated based on the physical and chemical properties. A neural network strategy was then used to identify possible binding sites by classifying the surface patches as protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-ligand or nonbinding sites. Kuznetsov et al. (2006) applied an SVM method to predict DNA-binding sites using the features including amino acid sequence, profile of evolutionary conservation of sequence positions, and low-resolution structural information. The results indicate that an SVM predictor based on a properly scaled profile of evolutionary conservation in the form of a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) significantly outperforms a PSSM-based neural network predictor. Such results imply that the combination of the two methods may improve the accuracy. Passerini et al. (2006) introduced a two-stage learning method for identifying histidines and cysteines that participate in binding of several transition metals and iron complexes. The first stage is an SVM, which is trained to locally classify the binding state of single histidines and cysteines. The second stage is a neural network trained to refine local predictions. The methods use only sequence information by utilizing position-specific evolutionary profiles.",

Because the residues that coordinate a metal often undergo conformational changes upon binding, the detection of binding sites based on simple geometric criteria in proteins without bound metal is difficult. However, aspects of the physicochemical environment around a metal-binding site are often conserved, even when this structural rearrangement occurs. Ebert and Altman (2008) developed a Bayesian classifier using known zinc-binding sites as positive training examples and nonmetal-binding regions as negative training examples. Babor et al. (2008) reported an approach that identifies transition metal-binding sites in proteins by combining the decision tree and SVM. In the first step, the geometric search of structural rearrangements following metal binding was taken into account by a decision tree classifier. A second classifier based on SVMs was then used to identify the metal-binding sites. Nayal and Honig (2006) proposed a comprehensive method to identify drug-binding sites in which 408 attributes were first computed for each cavity, and these were then used to distinguish drug-binding sites by the random forest classification scheme. The cavity properties cover eight broad categories, such as cavity size, cavity shape, hydrophobicity, electrostatics, hydrogen bonding, amino acid composition, secondary structure and rigidity.",

The method transforms a protein structure into a residue interaction graph, where graph nodes represent amino acid residues, and links represent their interactions. The active site, ligand-binding and evolutionary conserved residues are identified typically with a high closeness value, from which the functional residues are filtered out. del Sol et al. (2006) also represented a protein Liu et al. (2007b) structure as a small-world network and searched the topological determinants related to functionally important residues. The method investigates the performance of residues in protein families. The results indicate that enzyme active sites are located in surface clefts, and hetero-atom binding residues have deep cavities, while protein-protein interactions involve a more planar configuration. Wangikar et al. (2003) reported a method for detecting recurring side-chain patterns using an unbiased and automatic graph theoretic approach. The method first lists all structural patterns as subgraphs. The patterns are compared in a pairwise manner based on content and geometry criteria. The recurring pattern is then detected using an automatic search algorithm from the all-againstall pairwise comparison proteins. Similarly, Huan et al. (2006) defined a labeled graph representation of a protein structure in which edges connecting pairs of residues are labeled by the Euclidian distance between the C a atoms of the two residues. Based on this representation, a structural motif corresponding to a labeled clique occurs frequently among the graphical representation of the protein structures. The paper further presented an efficient mining algorithm aimed at discovering structure motifs in this setting.",

This algorithm uses a graph theory algorithm to identify oxygen clusters of the protein and a geometric algorithm to identify the center of these clusters. A cluster of four or more oxygen atoms has a high potential for calcium binding. A potential calcium-binding position is a clique and can be detected by a clique-detecting algorithm.

Recently, a novel category of networkbased analysis of the protein local structures at the macro level has been proposed (Liu et al. 2008) . The similarity of the local structures, specifically the pockets on the protein surface, is mapped to constitute a similarity network. The nodes represent the pockets, and the edges represent the certain similarity relationships among the pockets. The properties of the pocket similarity network are like other complex networks (Liu et al. 2008) . The similar pockets are identified by the clusters and community structures, and the special features of the network are helpful in clustering the pockets into similar groups (Liu et al. 2007b) , which may imply clusters of structure motifs and correspond to special functional implications (Liu et al. 2008) . With the network concept, the pockets can also be used to characterize and predict protein functions by annotating the topology neighbors. In this way, the accuracy of the prediction is better than that with the global structural similarity approach (Liu et al. 2007a ).",

One of the more powerful methods applied in location prediction is based on an important descriptor of the protein sample, i.e. the pseudo-amino acid (PseAA) composition (Chou 2001) . This descriptor can be used to represent a protein sequence with a discrete model yet without completely losing the sequence-order information. Since the concept of PseAA composition was introduced, various PseAA composition approaches have been developed, all with the aim of improving the prediction quality of protein attributes (Gao et al. 2005; Zhou et al. 2007a, b; Diao et al. 2008; Fang et al. 2008; Li and Li 2008) . The PseAA method has been widely used and extended. A very flexible PseAA composition generator (PseAAC) was established which enables users to generate 63 different kinds of PseAA composition. A web server called Cell-PLoc has recently been developed that allows users to predict the subcellular locations of proteins in various different organisms. PseAA composition and PSSM have also been combined in various algorithms to improve the prediction quality for membrane protein type (i.e. MemType-2L: Chou and Shen 2007a) , enzyme main-functional class and sub-functional class (i.e. EzyPred: Shen and Chou 2007a) and protein subnuclear localization (i.e. Nuc-PLoc: Shen and Chou 2007b) . A comprehensive review published recently provides a summary of these topics. In addition to sequence information, local structural information is useful, interesting and important in protein localization function prediction.",

However, since the relationships between structures and functions are so complex, local structure-based methods can be used to predict protein function directly by identifying the local structures carrying out particular functions. Laskowski et al. (2005) proposed a novel method of predicting protein function using local three-dimensional templates. The authors build a template database and use four types of templates-enzyme active sites, ligandbinding residues, DNA-binding residues and reverse templates-to construct the relationship between templates and functions. Ferre et al. (2005) described a method for the functionrelated annotation of protein structures based on the detection of local structural similarity with a library of annotated functional sites. An automatic procedure was used to annotate the function of the local surface regions, and then a sequence-independent algorithm was developed to compare exhaustively these functional patches with a larger collection of protein surface cavities. After tuning and validating the algorithm on a dataset of well-annotated structures, the results are able to provide functional clues to proteins that do not show any significant sequence or global structural similarity with proteins in the current databases. Binkowski et al. (2005) provided similar methods to annotate protein functions from the protein surface similarity. Pockets are identified by CASTp from several proteins. These pockets are queried in the pvSOAR to locate similar pockets corresponding to annotated proteins. The conservation among the pockets can be detected by the sequence identities and other similarity metrics. Tseng and Liang (2006) developed a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method for rate estimation of the special substitution rates of the short sequence of local structure. Moreover, a method for protein function prediction is presented by surface matching using scoring matrices derived from estimated substitution rates for residues located on the binding surfaces. The method is effective in identifying functionally related proteins that have overall low sequence identity. The method provided by Pazos and Sternberg (2004) first identifies functional sites in proteins by bridging the local structures and functions, then the functions of a target proteins can be inferred from the similarity of the functional sites in the position-specific scoring matrices.",

To compare the precision and coverage of the global structural similarity and that of local structures, Liu et al.

The similarity of regional local surface pockets and the global similarity of proteins are all represented by networks. The prediction is based on the network topology.

Although there are thousands of known interactions, a tiny fraction of these are available in precise molecular details. If we are able to examine structural details, systematic representation of the interaction would accurately reflect biological reality. For example, we can predict which part of the structures is most likely to be involved in interaction with other macromolecules, proteins, DNA or RNA by analyzing the properties of different local patches on the protein surface. The patch analysis, which considers properties of the surface such as flatness, hydrophobicity, charge and, in particular, residue conservation, is effective in identifying protein-protein interaction surfaces and has also been shown to successfully identify DNA-binding sites (Aloy and Russell 2006) . Structural systems biology is a very effective approach that combines protein interactions and protein three-dimensional structures. The mechanisms of protein and protein interaction lie in the local structures between the two protein surfaces. From this perspective, structural systems biology provides us with a new direction in the fields of structural biology and systems biology. It combines the key features of the two directions to provide more insight into linking the single protein and systematic interaction between proteins. The relationships between local structures and functions are expected to play important roles in structural systems biology.",

In addition, there is still much room for improvement in terms of the accuracy of the methods used to align the features between two local structures. The validation of the functions of structural motifs should also be conducted more carefully and by more reliable biological experiments. Recent advances in the field inspired by developments in sequences and structures demonstrate the great potential of such research in protein science in elucidating essential functional roles of the local structures. In our opinion, research aimed at bridging the gaps between local structures and function is still in its infant stage, and further advances in such areas will greatly enhance our ability to study the fundamental properties of proteins at a system-wide level. In other words, we expect to gain deep insight into essential mechanisms of biological systems from both structural and functional perspectives.",

To our knowledge, the function annotation problem is still in its developing period and needs more comprehensive or hybrid approaches. None of the existing methods are likely to be successful in all cases to annotate a protein with its functions correctly and comprehensively. One reason for this is that protein functions not only rely on the sequence and/or folding characteristics, but also on the cell environment, the cycle of the biological processes and other chemical compounds. There are still many difficultto-decipher proteins that researchers have been unable to annotate correctly by any existing method. Hence, a sensible strategy is to use different methods to incorporate data from multiple sources and to extensively utilize existing function annotations. Future directions include using combinations of different methods at different levels so as to efficiently explore the overall sequences, global structures and local structures and to obtain more information on interactions between the target proteins and others in the cellular context. Although computational methods generally cannot directly validate protein functions, the predefined tentative annotations provide valuable information as a basis for further efficient validation experiments.",
