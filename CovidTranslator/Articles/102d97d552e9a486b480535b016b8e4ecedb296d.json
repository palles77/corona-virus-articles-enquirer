            "text": "The application of molecular replacement (MR) in macromolecular crystallography can be limited by the \"model bias\" problem. Here we propose a strategy to reduce model bias when only part of a new structure is known: after the MR search, structure determination of the unknown part of the new structure can be facilitated by cross-crystal averaging of the known part of the new structure with the search model. This strategy dramatically improves electron density in the unknown part of the new structure. It has enabled us to determine the structures of two coronavirus receptorbinding domains each complexed with their receptor at moderate resolutions. In a test case, it also enabled automated model building when over 50% of an antigen-antibody complex was absent. These results suggest that this averaging strategy can be routinely used after MR to enhance the interpretability of electron density associated with missing model.",

Phases can be obtained using either experimental methods or molecular replacement (MR) (Rossmann and Blow, 1962) . Unlike the experimental methods, MR does not require experimentally determined phases for the unknown structure; instead, it relies upon the existence of an MR model, a previously determined structure that either has homology to or is part of the new structure. The MR search simulates the packing of the MR model in the new crystal, and finds the best match to the diffraction data. Afterwards, theoretical phases of the new structure can be calculated from the newly placed MR model and combined with the diffraction data of the new structure to calculate electron density maps. Compared with the experimental methods, MR does not require any bench work and hence is quicker and more convenient. Given the everexpanding database of known structures that can serve as MR models and recent development in homology modeling (Marti-Renom et al., 2000; Qian et al., 2007) , MR is bound to play an increasingly important role in future macromolecular crystallography.",

Model bias occurs due to the fact that phases usually contain more structural information than diffraction intensity and hence model-based phases yield electron density maps with heavy bias towards features of the MR model. Therefore, as a problem intrinsically associated with MR, model bias often leads to misinterpretation of electron density maps in the part represented by the MR model and/or un-interpretability of electron density maps in the part not represented by the MR model. Many strategies have been developed to reduce model bias in electron density map calculations. Notable approaches include the SIGMAA estimation of model phases (Read, 1997) , calculation of composite omit maps (Hodel et al., 1992) , density-modification methods with desirable phase combinations (Cowtan, 1999) , and a prime-and-switch method (Terwilliger, 2004) . However, these strategies are useful only when a major fraction of the new structure is represented by the MR model. If a significant portion of the new structure is not represented by the MR model, the partial phases generated by the MR model are usually insufficient to generate interpretable electron density maps in the unknown part.",

The mass of the ACE2 region was about 70% of the total mass of the ACE2-scRBD complex. Two different ACE2 structures were available, in which the two lobes of ACE2 adopt open and closed conformations, respectively (Towler et al., 2004) . We used the ACE2 structure in the open conformation as the MR model, and found two ACE2 molecules in each asymmetric unit (ASU) of the ACE2-scRBD complex structure. The newly placed ACE2 in the ACE2-scRBD complex structure was subjected to rigid-body refinement, with each of the two lobes as a rigid body. The R work and R free after rigid-body refinement were 41.7% and 43.2%, respectively. As expected, the partial model phases generated from the newly placed MR model were heavily biased towards ACE2, and the resulting electron density map in the scRBD region was poor and not interpretable ( Fig. 2A) . A two-fold NCS averaging in both the ACE2 region and scRBD region did not yield interpretable electron density map either (Fig. 2B) .",

NCS averaging only improved \u03c1/\u03c3 in the scRBD region from 0.8 to 1.2, which was still insufficient for model building; the cross-crystal averaging plus NCS averaging, however, improved \u03c1/\u03c3 in the scRBD region from 0.8 to 1.8, which led to efficient model building. The averaging did not significantly improve \u03c1/\u03c3 in the ACE2 region (\u03c1/\u03c3 was 2.6 and 2.7 before and after averaging, respectively), likely because the structural differences between the model and the ACE2 region in the complex were small and hence the electron density in the ACE2 region was dominated by the contribution from the model. Moreover, during the averaging process, whether or not cutting the resolution of the model (2.2 \u00c5) to the same as that of the complex (2.9 \u00c5) has little impact on the final \u03c1/\u03c3 in the scRBD region, and thus dampening B factor was not applied to the model crystal data. The above analyses using \u03c1/\u03c3 as indicators were consistent with visual inspections of the electron density maps.

The nlRBD and scRBD have no sequence homology, and MR search using the scRBD structure as the MR model did not find any solution. Instead, we carried out an MR search using the ACE2 structure in the open conformation as the MR model. We found four ACE2 molecules in each ASU of the new crystal.

Although in the original publication the structures of gp120, CD4 and antibody 17b were all previously known, in this study we only used antibody 17b as the MR model and monitored the electron density maps in the gp120-CD4 regions. Notably, the mass of the antibody was about 46% of the total mass of the complex and there was no NCS in the crystal. Rigid-body refinement of the initial MR solution at 2.2 \u00c5 gave R work and R free of 48.4% and 50.0%, respectively. Not surprisingly, the resulting election-density map was not interpretable in the gp120-CD4 regions (Fig. 4A ). We carried out cross-crystal averaging in the antibody region between the gp120-CD4-antibody complex structure and the antibody apo-structure. Because of the conformational flexibility of the antibody, we used four masks to cover each of the two domains in the light chain and heavy chain. After averaging, the electron density map in the gp120-CD4 region was clearly interpretable (Fig. 4B) . The significantly improved map even allowed automated building of the gp120-CD4 model, with most of the backbone correctly traced (Fig. 4C ).

Because of model bias, the partial MR model phases are often insufficient for structure determinations of the parts of a new crystal that are not represented by the MR model. In these cases, experimental phases are usually sought to complement the partial MR model phases, a tedious and time-consuming process with no guarantee of success. Here we show that after the MR search, the MR model should not be discarded as in common practice; instead, it can be further used as a cross-crystal averaging target with the known part of the new structure to improve the partial MR model phases. We suggest that this averaging strategy should be routinely used following MR, and thereby enable certain macromolecular structures containing significant portions of unknown structures to be determined without the necessity for experimental phases.",

This strategy has enabled us to determine two new crystal structures, SARS coronavirus RBD and NL63 coronavirus RBD each complexed with their common receptor ACE2. The RBD regions where the structures were previously unknown occupy 30% and 25% of the total masses of the complexes, respectively. Yet, the cross-crystal averaging strategy, aided by NCS averaging, led to interpretable electron density maps at moderate resolutions. This averaging strategy has been further tested on a representative structure selected from the PDB, the HIV-1 gp120 complexed with its receptor CD4 and antibody 17b. The gp120-CD4 regions whose structures were not used in the MR search step occupy 54% of the total mass of the complex. Remarkably, cross-crystal averaging in the antibody region, without the aid of NCS averaging, led to interpretable electron density maps in the gp120-CD4 region that allowed automated model building. Our study suggests that many antibody-antigen complex structures may be determined using this averaging strategy. In this sense, the averaging strategy is particularly significant, given the prevalence of antibody-antigen complex crystals.",

The \u03c1/\u03c3 indicator allows us to directly follow the improvement of the electron density maps during the averaging process. It confirms that cross-crystal averaging significantly improves the quality of electron density maps in the region where the structure was previously unknown. Because this region is not represented by the MR model, improvement of the electron density maps in this region means that model bias has been reduced. Why is the averaging strategy so effective in reducing model bias and improving electron densities in the unknown part of the new structure? This is because this method effectively brings in new, independent experimental data for the known part of the new structure, through independent Fourier transformation of this part in another crystal form containing the model. Therefore, although this method does not significantly improve the electron density in the known part of the new structure due to the good match of this region in the two crystal forms, the inclusion of the new data for the known part of the new structure reduces the relative contribution of the unknown part in the combined data. This results in higher signal to noise ratio and more accurate phase probabilities, which subsequently improve the quality of the electron density in the unknown portion.",

            "text": "The averaging strategy described in this study can facilitate structure determinations of these large macromolecules and macromolecular complexes when parts of their structures are known. How well the averaging strategy works may depend on a number of factors. It may work more effectively when high resolution and high quality data are available, when NCS is existent, when the known part is large relative to the unknown part in the new structure, and when the structural differences between the known part of the new structure and the model are small or the sequence homology between them is high. Because these factors interplay with each other, the limits of these factors are impossible for one study to explore, but hopefully will be established by further application of the technique in future studies. Despite the potential broad applications discussed above, the averaging strategy has some limitations. Although it can effectively reduce model bias in the unknown part of a new structure, this strategy is still subjected to model bias in the known part of the new structure. Consequently, it may not improve the electron density map in the known part of the new structure as effectively as it does in the unknown part of the new structure, especially when the structural differences between the known part of the new structure and the model are large or sequence homology between them is low. Nevertheless, because of its efficiency in reducing model bias in the unknown parts of new structures as well as its potential general applications in structure determinations of large macromolecules and macromolecular complexes, this averaging strategy may help extend the utility of MR in macromolecular crystallography.",
