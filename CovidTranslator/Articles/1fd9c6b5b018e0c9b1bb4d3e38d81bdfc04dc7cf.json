The role of specimen processing in concentrating nucleic acid targets and removing inhibitors of amplification is largely neglected, despite its important role in the sensitivity of the assay. Most techniques mentioned here involve RT-PCR, unless otherwise specified. RT-PCR lowers the incidence of amplicon contamination in the laboratory, and has allowed many nucleic acid amplification techniques to come \"out of the closet,\" but does not prevent specimen contamination. The authors have also attempted to select only one current citation to support most points, and these selections are arbitrary.

This represents significant time and money saving, although it does not eliminate the need to grow M tuberculosis for susceptibility testing. If there is only one visible colony and if the probe result is negative, whether due to inadequate sample, improper probe selection, or growth of an organism not recognized by the probe, one must wait for the colony to regrow before further analysis (Fairfax and Salimnia, unpublished data).

In the 1980s and 1990s, it was recognized that infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) is necessary but not sufficient for the development of cervical carcinoma. More than 100 HPV genotypes exist, of which 13 are associated with a high risk of cervical carcinoma (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68) . More than 70% of sexually active women become infected with HPV. Most infections, even with high-risk organisms, resolve without apparent sequellae. Why others progress is still unknown. 9 The Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2; Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) is FDA approved for primary screening, and to determine whether women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance should be subjected to culposcopy. It may be used with the Cytyc PreservCyt Solution for the Cytyc ThinPrep Pap Test (Hologic). 10 In the first step, the patient specimen is allowed to react with a pool of RNA probes designed to hybridize specifically to the DNA of high-risk HPV strains. Antibody to RNA/DNA hybrids coats the wells of a microtiter plate and captures any hybrids. After washing away unbound specimen and reagents, detector antihybrid antibodies, each conjugated with multiple molecules of alkaline phosphatase, bind to each captured Diagnostic Molecular Microbiology target, amplifying the signal. A colorless substrate for the alkaline phosphatase is added and chemiluminescence develops proportional to the amount of second antibody bound.",

The need for more sensitivity has been questioned, as hc2 has already been shown to be sensitive, but not highly specific, for the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or overt malignancy. The presence of high-risk DNA below the detection limit of hc2 appears to be associated with a low risk for malignancy. 9 However, new information suggests that infections acquired in the early years of sexual activity may reactivate with aging. 11 If this is supported by further studies, more sensitive assays might be indicated. There is also a suggestion that unusual HPV strains may cause cervical carcinoma or precursor lesions in restricted populations. 12 Thus, the strains included in the assay may need periodic review. 13 in contrast to the LLQ of 10 copies/mL for the latest nucleic acid amplification viral load techniques (see later in this article). Although overnight incubation has been standard, a new algorithm that can be performed in 9 hours has been published. 14 The bDNA technique resembles a \"molecular tree\" (Fig. 1) . The wells of microtiter plates are coated with capture probes, which bind the target extender, then the target. Three more hybridization steps occur, with significant amplification at each. In the last, multiple alkaline phosphatase-coupled probes bind to the branched amplifier probes. Each enzyme converts multiple molecules of its colorless substrate into colored end product, allowing the detection of small numbers of initial targets. bDNA is unaffected by amplicon contamination (because there are no amplicons) and relatively insensitive to inhibitors that plague many NAATs. It is also less sensitive to problems resulting from freezing specimens in plasma preparation (PP) tubes. 15 This mode of specimen transport is no longer recommended for amplificationbased viral load determinations, as DNA escaping from the gel matrix in the PP tube can increase the apparent viral load by hundreds of copies/mL, which was unnoticeable when the viral loads were routinely in the thousands or tens of thousands, 15 but which is unacceptable today, when viral loads of <20 are frequently reported (see later in this article).",

It detects rRNA from Gardnerella vaginalis, used as an indicator for bacterial vaginosis (BV), C albicans, and Trichomonas vaginalis. The sensitivity has been adjusted to avoid giving positive results with low concentrations of G vaginalis and C albicans, which often colonize the normal vagina. It is formatted to be performed in a cassette superficially resembling the lateral flow tests used for the serologic detection of influenza or rotavirus antigens and was the first FDA-approved molecular test based on Diagnostic Molecular Microbiology lateral flow. After collection on a proprietary swab, the specimen is lysed to release the nucleic acids, buffered to stabilize the nucleic acids and establish stringency, and added to the cassette, which is incubated at the proper temperature for nucleic acid hybridization. The cassette contains 5 \"beads,\" each coupled to a capture probe: 1 for each of the 3 analytes, plus positive and negative controls. Next, enzyme-linked detector probes bind to specific sequences on the target organism's rRNA. Unbound sample components and probes are washed away. A colorless substrate is converted to a blue product if sufficient target and detector probe have bound. A blue \"bead\" indicates a positive result. 17 Numerous publications have revealed that health care providers are significantly less accurate than VPIII for the diagnosis of significant candidiasis, and T vaginalis. The role of the VPIII in the diagnosis of BV is still the subject of some debate, as G vaginalis is found both in the presence and the absence of BV. In an analysis of results from our laboratory, mixed infections were common. Of those patients positive for T vaginalis, almost 2/3 were positive for one or both of the other organisms. 18 FDAapproved NAATs with higher sensitivity and a higher price are also available for T vaginalis (Hologic/Gen-Probe). 19 ",

Two of these are isothermal, avoiding the requirement for expensive thermal cyclers: strand-displacement amplification (SDA; BD Probe Tec ET and Q x ) and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA; Aptima Combo 2; Hologic Gen-Probe). These are both described in detail in the methods article. The TMA assay targets organism-specific rRNA sequences in each organism: 23S rRNA for CT and 16S rRNA for NG. It begins with target capture on magnetic beads, and ends with the hybridization protection assay similar to those previously described for the AccuProbe tests, although each species of detector probe is attached to a different acrydinium ester. One flashes very rapidly and its chemiluminescence attenuates before the other begins to fluoresce (glow). Thus, they can be detected sequentially in the same tube. 20 The BD SDA CT assay targets an open reading frame in the cryptic CT plasmid. 21 The testing is very complicated to describe (see the methods article), but much simpler to perform, especially on automated instrumentation. The manufacturers of both isothermal amplification tests sell high-throughput analyzers using the same (or modified, as in SDA Q x ) technology. Two PCR-based tests, by Roche (Roche Cobas Amplicor [RCA]; Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Pleasonton, CA) and Abbott (Abbott RealTime [ART]; Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) CT/NG assay (on their m2000 automated platform) are also major players in the huge market for diagnosis",

Both PCR-based CT tests originally targeted sequences in the cryptic plasmid. 22 The older tests are FDA approved for cervical swabs, genital swabs, and urine. Several are approved for physician-collected or self-collected vaginal swabs. Both TMA and SDA are approved for use with the specimen collected for the Thin Prep PAP smear technique, 20,23 although the newer versions may not yet be approved for all specimen types. To prevent contamination, the sample for nucleic acid amplification must be removed before processing the cytology sample for cellular analysis. 20, 23 The specificities of all the assays are comparable, although the RCA has been reported to detect nongonorrhoeae Neisseria, 24, 25 and their sensitivities appear to be adequate for genital specimens, with TMA appearing slightly more sensitive than standard SDA, both of which may be slightly better than either PCR assay. 21, 22, 24, 26 In general, the sensitivities of all 4 tests are lower for CT than for NG, perhaps due to a lower organism burden for CT. 22 The high-throughput, automated BD SDA assays for NG and CT (ProbeTec Q x ) performed in extracted mode on their Viper System have improved sensitivity. This may be due partly to target changes and in part to contaminants being removed by use of a magnetic, ferric oxide bead-capture system. The ferric oxide technique could be generalizable because it does not require the presence of specific target sequences. Briefly, the bacteria are lysed in a high-pH solution. The pH is lowered to generate a positive charge on the ferric oxide particles, which bind the negatively charged nucleic acids. The particles are magnetically captured and washed, and the bound DNA is eluted by raising the pH. The extracted DNA is buffered to a pH appropriate for the amplification assay. 21, 23 Recently, several studies have been performed to extend these tests to rectal and oropharyngeal specimens.",

The FRET detector consists of 2 different probes, complementary to adjacent sequences on the target amplicon, and each attached to a different fluor. When activated by incident UV light, the first fluor emits energy at an unmonitored wavelength. If the second probe is bound adjacent to it, the energy is transferred to the second flour, which then emits light at the wavelength monitored by the sensor. At the end of the PCR assay, a melting curve for the amplicon-probe complex can be generated. The melting temperature (Tm) is characteristic of each amplicon-probe combination. If there is a mismatch between the probe and the amplicon, the melting temperature decreases. 33 The Tm difference has been exploited in a test that distinguishes between herpes simplex 1 and 2 (Roche). The PCR primers bind sequences common to both viruses within the HSV DNA polymerase gene. The amplicon detector probes match the HSV-2 sequence, which differs from that of HSV-1 by 2 bp. Melting curve analysis reveals a reproducible Tm for HSV-2 that is about 10 C higher than that exhibited by HSV-1. 34 Occasional mutant HSV strains have been detected that have intermediate melting temperatures. These can be reported as positive for HSV, but the type is not clear. Types 1 and 2 could be distinguished by sequencing the amplicons, by using an assay employing a different target sequence, or by the Tm of the amplicon, which is said to be 0.9 C higher for the HSV-2 variant than the type 1 variant. 35 The MultiCode RTx system uses an unusual PCR amplification technique in which no detector probe is used and in which the fluorescence actually decreases as amplification progresses. It was developed by EraGen BioSciences, Inc (Madison, WI; acquired by Luminex Corporation [Austin, TX] in 2011). Their Multicode-RTx Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 kit was FDA approved in 2011.

Theoretically, one can construct a standard curve of copy number versus CT and determine the quantity of analyte in a patient specimen by referring to the curve. However, variations in extraction efficiency and the presence of inhibitors can introduce significant errors, particularly at low levels of analyte, when one is attempting to distinguishing \"only a few\" from \"none.\" One relatively straightforward method to overcome this problem includes the addition of a control target or quantitation standard (QS) into the patient sample before extraction. The target and the QS are extracted, amplified, and detected together, controlling for the extraction and for any inhibitors present. The ideal QS should be the same size and base composition as the target to be quantified, with the same primer binding sites. It should differ enough in sequence that the detector probe or probes for the target do not bind to it, and its own detector probe should fluoresce at a different wavelength from that of the target. Then, quantitation should be a simple mathematical calculation. 33 However, at low target concentrations, the standard curve is no longer straight. Roche has incorporated complex mathematical calculations into its recent viral load assays to account for this divergence.",

Sequence differences between the numerous organism strains and the inherent mutability of the organisms also make accurate quantification difficult, especially for RNA viruses, such as HIV and HCV.

Even at the peak of an influenza epidemic, an individual may be infected with respiratory syncytial virus instead or concurrently. Furthermore, mixed infections are more common than many had imagined. 41, 42 Some virus infections are treatable, and others have different isolation requirements if the patient is hospitalized. 42 Thus, molecular panels that could detect multiple etiologic agents of diseases clearly are desirable. Four multiplex respiratory panels are FDA approved at this writing: Luminex xTAG RVP (xRVP) and RVP Fast (xRVPF) (Luminex Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada); Film Array Respiratory Panel (FARP; BioFire Diagnostics [formerly Idaho Technologies], Salt Lake City, UT), and eSensor Respiratory Panel (eSRP) (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA).

Currently available NGS techniques are based on using clonal amplicons for parallel multistrand sequencing. The combination of high-speed and high-throughput data analysis has made NGS an excellent tool to take clinical analysis of nucleic acid sequences to a new level. With NGS, it is possible to detect and quantify quasispecies of HIV, HCV, or HBV circulating at low levels in the blood of infected patients and to learn more about their roles in the development of resistance and associated treatment failures. This was difficult or impossible by using methods mentioned previously. Despite increasing numbers of articles on the applications of NGS, this system has not found its way into routine clinical microbiology testing because of lack of FDA approval, high cost, and availability of alternatives. 47 Diagnostic Molecular Microbiology NGS has significantly improved our ability to study the composition of entire communities of microorganisms (metagenomics) without organism culture. NGS simultaneously provides the sequences of genetic material from members of the entire microbial community. Analysis of these data allows determination of the relative proportions of organisms within the biome analyzed. It can also determine gene expression and metabolic pathway utilization in a microbial community. Human-microbial metagenomics studies are focused on understanding the relationship between commensal microbial communities in health and disease, 48 including cardiovascular disease. 4 NGS has also been applied to rapid investigations of outbreaks in hospital settings. 49 ",

At that time, MS was used almost exclusively for the identification of anaerobes by analysis of volatile or volatilized short-chain organic acids. New MS techniques provide a general tool for the identification of microorganisms growing in colonies on culture plates. This requires 2 to 5 minutes and has the potential to improve significantly the turnaround time for microbiology culture reports and to reduce labor costs, especially when coupled with other laboratory automation that is now becoming available. Up-front costs are high, but rapidity of results can impact antibiotic usage and patient outcomes, shortening hospital stays and lowering total costs. 3 The new technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI TOF). Currently, there are 2 MALDI TOF instruments available in the United States for rapid identification of microorganisms. One, developed by Shimadzu Scientific Instruments (Columbia, MD) and licensed to BioMerieux (Durham, NC), has just been FDA-approved. The other can be obtained directly from its manufacturer (Bruker Daltonics, Bellerica, MA), who has also licensed it to both Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics (Tarrytown, NY) and to BD. However, the great benefit of easy, rapid, and accurate identification of microorganisms has encouraged some laboratories to purchase these systems and perform their own validations before FDA clearance.",

Light emitted from these \"high-temperature sparks\" is collected and dispersed. The atoms present in the specimen are identified by peaks in the atomic emission spectrum. The ratios of the intensities of these peaks form a \"spectral fingerprint\" that is unique to the bacterial genus and species (LIBS spectrum). This is compared with a database to allow identification of bacterial genus/species. 53 RS can also rapidly identify bacteria to the strain level. It uses a visible or near-infrared laser that provides a reproducible molecular spectrum from the whole bacterial cell, which is unique for each bacterial species. 54 ",

Asymmetric PCR on the specimen was performed using 16S bacterial rRNA as a target. The PCR product was captured by the capture probes and probed with organism-specific detector probes complementary to species-specific regions of the rRNA molecules. The detector probes are covalently linked to magnetic nanoparticles. The bound magnetic nanoparticles are detected by faster relaxation of their signal in a micronuclear magnetic resonance system. The assay is carried out in a microfluidic chip, requires 2 hours and can be carried out with only 2 mL of sample. It can reportedly detect 1 bacterial cell, as well as multiple infections, and can be applied directly to blood and aspirated body fluids. It has been adapted to detect the mRNAs of mecA (which codes for PBP2a, the enzyme responsible for methicillin-resistance in S aureus), and the Panton-Valentine leukocidin, which is found in the most common of the communityassociated methicillin-resistant S aureus.
