Preservation of sample integrity is essential for accurate test results, especially if detection or quantification of RNA is desired. Unlike DNA, RNA is unstable and is readily degraded by naturally occurring endonucleases (RNases) that are present in the environment and tissues. Samples for RNA testing should be handled with gloves to prevent contamination with RNases present on the skin. Samples for RNA testing should be promptly submitted to the laboratory or stored in a freezer at \u03ea80\u00b0C until forwarded for testing. Samples may also be treated with buffers designed to minimize RNA degradation, with several commercial additives being available for this purpose, but their use varies among laboratories. It is best to consult the specific laboratory for their protocol for sample submission. Although DNA tends to be more stable than RNA, naturally occurring endonucleases that degrade DNA do exist. Test samples should be aseptically collected and refrigerated or frozen until submission. The ability of PCR to detect extremely low levels of DNA in a submitted patient sample results in the very real potential of falsepositive test results due to DNA contamination.",

In 1971, Kleppe demonstrated that DNA could be artificially replicated in vitro with a DNA polymerase enzyme. 4 Combined with methods allowing for the synthesis of DNA oligonucleotides, Kary Mullis developed the technique of PCR in 1983 and won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work. 5 PCR has become one of the most widely used technologies in veterinary research and molecular diagnostics of infectious disease. The wide range of applications include the detection of DNA or RNA derived from infectious bacterial, viral, mycoplasmal, parasitic, protozoal, or fungal organisms; evaluation of specific genetic defects; and quantization of cytokines and cellular growth factors. PCR testing can be used on a wide range of samples, including tissue from biopsies or necropsies, blood, feces, tissue, soil, cerebrospinal fluid, and swabs of mucosal surfaces. PCR uses the highly specific molecular recognition ability of Watson-Crick base pairing to provide the selectivity needed for a nucleic acid probe to bind to a targeted DNA sequence and allow for its exponential amplification. Specific fragments of DNA are replicated by cyclical heating and cooling through repeated temperature stages in a thermal cycler unit (Fig 1) . Each cycle can double the amount of existing target DNA. Repeatedly amplifying the target sequence over 30 to 40 cycles theoretically allows for millions (2 30 ) of DNA copies to be produced. PCR assays are thus extremely sensitive. They are capable of detecting femtograms (10 \u03ea15 g) of target DNA sequence in a large mixture, or up to a microgram (10 \u03ea6 g) of nontarget DNA. The DNA obtained at the end of the reaction can be used for a variety of applications, including sequencing, cloning, or as a probe for in situ hybridization.",

The dye intercalates between double-stranded DNA formed in the PCR reaction and, when exposed to an excitation source, fluoresces.

These probes do not react with primer-dimers or other nonspecific products that may be generated during the PCR reaction as may occur with SYBR Green reactions. However, a welldesigned and optimized SYBR Green amplification is a very effective testing technology. Unlike TaqMan probes, the SYBR Green reporter remains intact so a melt curve analysis can be performed on the amplification product. Melt curve analysis measures the dissociation characteristics of doublestranded DNA during heating. Melt curve analysis is sensitive enough to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and can distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous gene alleles by the dissociation patterns produced (Fig 3) . The advancement of this technology to produce highresolution melt analysis will provide higher sensitivity for SNP detection within entire dye-stained amplicons for genomic analysis.",

These can be cDNAs, oligonucleotides of varying length, or genomic sequences that are either radioactively or fluorescently labeled. Artificial single-stranded DNA or RNA ligands, short oligonucleotides or peptide molecules that can be generated against amino acids, drugs, proteins, and other molecules are called aptamers. 19 Aptamers bind to a specific target molecule with high affinity and selectivity ranging from the micromolar to the nanomolar level, and they can discriminate between closely related targets. 16, 20 A high-density array can be generated by applying aptamers to the substrate with robotic pins or inkjet technology, or by an in situ photolithographic synthesis process. These techniques allow for the production of a high-density chip containing thousands of short probes targeted at different loci within a single gene or multiple genomes. High-density microarrays may have up to 106 test sites in a 1 \u03eb 2 cm 2 area. 17 The core principle of DNA microarrays is based on hybridization probing, the property of complementary nucleic acid sequences to specifically pair with each other by forming hydrogen bonds between nucleotide base pairs. Hybridization occurs between 2 cDNA sequences such as the nucleic acid probes immobilized on the solid surface of a chip and the mobile DNA, cDNA, or messenger RNA (mRNA) sample. A high number of complementary base pairs in a nucleotide sequence allows for tighter noncovalent bonding between the 2 strands to occur. Probetarget hybridization is usually quantified through the detection of a fluorophore, silver, or chemiluminescence-labeled target. After the hybridization step is complete, the microarray is scanned. The fluorescent tags are excited by a laser, read by a microscopic camera, and computer integrated into a digital image of the array. Software analyzes each microarray spot calculating the red-to-green fluorescence ratio and subtracting out background data. The nature and relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target are determined. DNA microarrays have been used for the detection of infectious and genetic disease, cancer diagnostics, and forensic and genetic identification purposes.

The microarray was capable of simultaneously detecting hundreds of viruses in a single clinical sample. The approach used randomized primers in an RT-PCR to amplify any viral RNA that was present in the clinical sample. The PCR product was then hybridized to the microarray comprising 1600 probes, representing nearly 140 respiratory virus genomes. Viruses that were represented on the microarray were readily detected and identified by specific hybridization to the appropriate oligonucleotides. This methodology enabled the simultaneous detection of hundreds of viruses, including essentially all respiratory tract viruses. This microarray system greatly expanded the spectrum of detectable viruses in a single assay while simultaneously providing the capability to discriminate among viral subtypes. Similarly, Sengupta and colleagues developed microarrays with 476 probes to distinguish among various influenza viruses. 29 Although initial efforts were focused on only a few hundred viruses, DeRisi and colleagues devised a microarray representing all known human, animal, aquatic, and plant viruses called the ViroChip. The most highly conserved genomic sequences from within viral families were chosen for representation on the microarray. Viruses represented included double-and single-stranded DNA viruses, retroviruses, and both positive-and negative-stranded RNA viruses. DNA fragments of virtually every virus ever discovered, about 22,000 different viral sequences, were represented on the ViroChip.",

As a next-generation tool, protein arrays in their role as miniaturized, multiplexed immunoassays are perfectly suited for generating a maximum of diagnostically relevant information from very minute samples. 65 Protein microarrays offer unparalleled throughput, minimal reagent consumption, and sensitive simultaneous detection of multiple targets. 58 Currently, there is rapid advancement of antibody microarrays that have been developed for clinical, biothreat, and point-of-care applications. Early applications included the development of a protein microarray with 35 antibodies, which was used to subtype the 20 most common Salmonella serovars, 66 and a similar microarray was developed for E. coli. 67 Lipopolysaccharide, carbohydrate-based, and whole-cell microarrays have also been used for antibody-based detection of pathogens such as Francisella tularensis. 68, 69 Liquid array technology has been adapted to the detection of avian influenza (AI) virus antibody in commercial poultry. 70 The assay uses recombinant AI virus nucleoprotein conjugated to microspheres to detect the influenza-specific antibody. The AI virus liquid array has a 99.3% sensitivity and a 94.7% specificity. This liquid array format can theoretically detect 100 different analytes in a single assay. Therefore, this technology has the potential to simultaneously detect and subtype all influenza hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins, as well as antibodies specific to the other relevant avian diseases.",

            "text": "The analysis of thousands of small molecules (metabolites) (e.g., sugars, organic acids, amino acids, nucleotides) by means of a global approach is referred to as metabolomics. Combined with pattern recognition processes, metabolomics defines a metabolic phenotype (metabotype) in the study species. 89 This approach combines high-throughput sample analysis with computer-assisted pattern recognition techniques whereby the full metabolite profile (metabolome) of a cell, tissue, or organism is determined. Metabolomics is a powerful investigative tool for studying the biochemical effects of disease and screening for potential pharmacologic agents. Alterations in the metabolic profile often present much earlier in the course of disease than induced histopathological changes. Metabolomics can be a sensitive, early indicator of a disease process, and because metabolites are conserved across species lines, screening patterns can be applied to a wide range of species. 89 The application of metabolomics in veterinary medicine is in its infancy. Whitfield and colleagues used metabolomics to distinguish canine congenital portosystemic vascular anomalies from acquired hepatopathies. 90 Other early applications include the analysis of cadmium toxicity in rodents, 91 assessment of sublethal stress in aquatic organisms, 92 and neurotransmitter deficits in cerebral tissue from a mouse model of human batten disease. 93 Although current applications to the field of veterinary medicine are rare, metabolomics use in early preclinical safety assessment make it a rapidly developing tool in the field of drug investigations. Metabolomics enables a noninvasive systems assessment of a broad spectrum of biologic responses by an individual to the effects induced by therapeutic compounds, which could impact all stages of veterinary drug research and development.",

Conventional microbial culture and sensitivity testing methods require at least 2 days' time because of the reliance on growth and isolation of microorganisms. Veterinarians must frequently treat patients empirically with broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, which may not be needed or may not be effective. The common use of broadspectrum antimicrobials is associated with an increasing rate of microorganism resistance, which may complicate patient treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of diseases reduce the risk of the patient developing long-term disease complications. For some diseases, a prompt treatment will also reduce further transmission of the disease to other animals or humans.",

This assay-based testing can be extended to include the detection and characterization of genes or mutations associated with antimicrobial resistance and virulence. 94 Advances in genomics and proteomics will provide the essential nucleotide or amino-acid sequence data required to design accurate assays. Efficiency will also depend on the development of rapid, simple, and efficient methods for microbial nucleic acid or protein extraction from a variety of clinical samples. Finally, rapid and specific assays, and the ability to detect all or most targeted microorganisms in multiplex target amplification systems, or signal amplification technologies, are needed. This will help future technologies reach a level of analytical sensitivity appropriate for testing directly from clinical samples without previous enrichment, thereby leading to more judicious antimicrobial usage and a concurrent reduction in antimicrobial-resistant organisms. 94 To be useful, diagnostic methods must be accurate, simple, and affordable.",
