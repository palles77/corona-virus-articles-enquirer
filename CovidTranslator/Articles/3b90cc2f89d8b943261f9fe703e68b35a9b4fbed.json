In addition to IHN and IPN, four other viral diseases cause major economic losses among cultured fishes in Japan. These include viral pancreatic hepatic necrosis of yellowtail, rhabdovirus infection of Japanese flounder and black rock fish, Kuchishiro-sho of tiger puffer fish, and epidermal hyperplasia or necrosis of Japanese flounder. Over the years, a number of other viruses have been isolated from, or have been observed by electron microscopy, in moribund fish. Members of 10 of the existing families of animal viruses are represented in this group. Their importance to the aquaculture industry in Japan is reviewed here.",

The pathogen was not identified for about 10 years (4) when the disease was diagnosed as IPN by Sano (1) . The causative virus is a member of the Birnaviridae family of viruses. IPN is an acute systemic disease of fry and fingerling rainbow trout (5, 6) and is widespread in Japan (7) with its distribution shown in Figure 1 . The characteristic clinical signs of this disease are body darkening, moderate exophthalmia, and abdominal distention. Internally, the spleen, heart, liver, and kidneys are pale and the digestive tract is almost always devoid of food (8) . IPNV is pathogenic to rainbow trout, Fig. 1. Geographic distribution of IPN in Japan, 1975 to 1988 amago (0. thodurus), and kokanee salmon fry, but not for yamame (landlocked masu salmon, 0. musou) fry (9) . Although the major losses caused by IPNV occur among rainbow trout and amago salmon, IPNV has also been isolated from coho (0. kisutch) salmon (lo), char (Salvelinus fontinalis), masu salmon and coregonus trout cultured with rainbow trout (Yamazaki, personal communication) . Susceptibility of fish to IPNV depends on their body weight with smaller fry being more susceptible. Recently rainbow trout fry in Japan appear to have become less susceptible to IPNV (11) and losses attributed to IPN have decreased (Fig. 2) , nevertheless, it is still a major problem for Japanese aquaculture.

Subsequently, an outbreak of this disease occurred in yamame and rainbow trout cultured on Hokkaido. Since 1974, IHN has been known to infect rainbow trout fry on Honshu Island (12) as well, especially its central part, where in several districts river water was found to be contaminated with IHNV and thus unsuitable for trout culture. Figure 4 shows the current distribution of IHNV in Japan. IHNV has also been isolated from moribund chum (0. keta), masu and amago salmon (12,13), and ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) (14). In the case of wild masu salmon, the typical clinical sign of V-shaped hemorrhages in the muscle were observed (Fig. 5) . Recently, large (250-80 g body weight) kokanee and amago salmon, and rainbow trout were found to be infected with IHNV (15, 16) with petechiae in the fat and on the body cavity wall regularly seen.",

In Nagano Prefecture, IHN is controlled by the following method (19): the eggs are disinfected with iodine in the early eyed stage, since fry are the most susceptible to IHNV; they are then reared in well water or ultraviolet-irradiated river water (20). After the fish pass through this sensi- tive stage they can be transferred to normal ponds for culture. Other control measures being investigated include establishment of an IHN-resistant strain of rainbow trout and development of a vaccine using a low virulence clone of the virus (21, 22) .",

The titer of infectious viral particles in diseased fish was as high as 105/g of internal organ, however, no severe histopathological changes were observed (Yasutake, personal communication).

A rhabdovirus was isolated from both the diseased hirame and ayu and was designated hirame rhabdovirus (HRV) (Fig. 15 ). Characterization of HRV has shown it to be sufficiently distinct from other known fish rhabdoviruses; therefore, this virus has been given a separate species name Rhabdovirus olivaceus, after the scientific name of its host species (54). HRV has a broad host range, being pathogenic for hirame, black sea bream (Milio macrocephalus), red sea bream (Crysophrys major), black rock fish (Sebastes inermis), redspotted grouper (Epinephelus akuara), spottybelly greenling (Hexagrammos agrammus), yellowfin goby (Acanthogobiusflavimanus), and sunrise sculpin (Pseudoblennius cottoides) among oceanic fishes (41, 55, 56, 57) . Salmonid species, especially rainbow trout are also susceptible (58). The , 1986-1987. signs of infection are congestion of the gonads, focal hemorrhaging in skeletal muscle and fins, and the accumulation of ascitic fluid (Fig. 16) . Histopathologically, the kidney and spleen tissues showed necrotic changes and hemorrhaging. Skeletal muscle, testis, and ovary revealed hyperemia and hemorrhaging of capillary vessels (59). HRV is distributed widely in Japan (Fig. 17 ) ranging from Hokkaido to Honshu (55).

Affected fish were characterized by opaqueness of the fins. Histopathologically, hyperplasia was observed in the epidermal layer of the fins and skin. Hexagonal virus particles were observed in the nucleus (100-140 nm in diameter without an envelope) and cytoplasm (190-230 nm with an envelope) of infected epider-ma1 cells by electron microscopy. Experimentally, exposure of fish to the filtrate of an infected tissue homogenate produced 18-50% mortalities in flounder larvae, with more than 90% of the survivors exhibiting epidermal hyperplasia. The morphological features of the virus along with its sensitivity to treatment with ether, pH 3, or a 30-min exposure to 50 'C indicated it was a member of the herpesvirus group. Miyazaki et al.

Seasonal variation in the prevalence of lymphocystis was noted with the highest incidence occurring in summer. As occurs in many other species, lymphocystis infection does not result in large numbers of mortalities but infected fish are not marketable because the unsightly appearance of their surface lesions makes them aesthetically undesirable. Lymphocystis cells were observed mainly on the fins or body surface. The virus particles were polyhedral, presenting hexagonal or pentagonal profiles in tissue sections (Fig. 22) . They may be seen in crystalline array and they are always located in the cytoplasm. The viruses isolated from marine fish in Japan are summarized in Table 3 .",
