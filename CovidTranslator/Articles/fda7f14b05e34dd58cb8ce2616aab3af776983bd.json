The response to this challenge and threat has been for legacy airlines to create an airline-within-airline (AWA). This study reviews prior literature regarding the hotel industry and multi-brand strategy, and also uses case studies to examine the evolution of the AWA strategy at the Singapore Airlines Group and the Qantas Group between 2000 and 2016 in order to identify why these airlines operate AWAs successfully. High levels of autonomy, clear strategies, complimentary route networks, appropriate resources and minimal cannibalisation are identified as the primary attributes required for a successful AWA operation. Legacy airlines whose AWA strategy failed in the past often did not operate with all these essential attributes, which resulted in their AWAs undermining and competing directly with their own operations.",

LCC's were nimble organisations that had clear future orientated strategies that could easily adapt to the changing market conditions. This was particularly important as it allowed for a sustained competitive advantage over rivals to be achieved (Pearson et al., 2015a,b) . At the core of LCC strategies were simple streamlined product offerings, high capacity aircraft, mono-aircraft fleets, and efficient crewing methods (Button and Ison, 2008; Graham and Vowles, 2006) . The cumbersome network carriers struggled to compete with these fast moving carriers with their low overheads and high customer satisfaction. As a result, these network carriers had to significantly alter their own operations in order to remain relevant and survive (Graf, 2005) . Their response was to create an Airline-Within-Airline (AWA).",

However, the high failure rate of numerous AWAs over the years suggests that these operations are far more complicated than many network carriers originally believed. AWAs require a significant amount of resources, personnel and market understanding to be implemented correctly and allow for sustained operations to occur. The US network carriers, namely United Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Airlines and US Airways all created AWAs which would ultimately fail, primarily due to incorrect fleet choice, competing rather than complimentary networks, and a lack of vision and strategic direction from management; all of which are critical attributes of a successful AWA strategy (Morrell, 2005) .",

Seven years later in 2010 the Singapore Airlines Group acquired a majority stake in Tigerair for low-cost short-haul operations. The following year, Scoot was created which would serve as the group's lowcost medium to long-haul option. Tigerair became a fully owned subsidiary of the Singapore Airlines Group in 2016. All of these AWAs continue to be in existence, and allow their respective Group's access to an ever increasing pool of lucrative budget travellers and middle income passengers that they would not have had access to if they relied on their previous premium-only strategies (Merket and Pearson, 2014) .",

If it is managed incorrectly, the result can include strategic incoherence, market cannibalisation and duplication of resources (Mason and Milne, 1994) . Observing the actions of the hotel sector from the hospitality industry can yield insights into how and why this industry can succeed in offering a portfolio of brands to their customers while airlines struggle to offer more than one. Hoteliers offer numerous brand options in order to best meet their guests' needs, as they recognise that a corporate city guest has differing expectations than that of a leisure guest. Therefore, the hotel operators create multiple brands that appeal to specific markets rather than expecting all groups to be satisfied with a single option. The same premise can be applied to airlines as the needs of low-cost passengers inevitably differ to those of premium passengers. In turn, airlines must alter their operations and create new brands and offerings to best meet the needs of different groups of travellers. This must be done in a sustainable manner to avoid causing confusion to passengers or cannibalising other parts of an airline's operations, which was a significant issue with the early AWAs from the USA (Gados and Gillen, 2008; Morrell, 2005) .",

The literature was reviewed based on a set of pre-determined keywords that related to the AWA concept and strategy, the aviation industry, the hotel industry, and the multi-brand strategy. A total of 143 pieces of literature were reviewed in this study consisting of 94 journal articles, 12 books, and 37 other publications. The case studies of the AWA strategy are limited to the pre-determined Asia-Pacific airlines, namely those within the Singapore Airlines Group (Singapore Airlines, Silkair, Scoot and Tigerair) and those within the Qantas Group (Qantas and Jetstar) between 2000 and 2016. It is acknowledged that there can be some issues and limitations regarding the case study research method. The major issue being that a definitive solution or generalisation regarding the studied issues will not necessarily be identified, particularly if only one case study is presented (Crowe et al., 2011; Johnson, 1994; Tellis, 1997) . This is mitigated in this article by undertaking a multi-case study approach which allows for the outcomes of each case study to be compared to one another in order to observe if the same or similar operating methods and strategies are present, improving the generalisability of the research finding into the real world context (Leonard- Barton, 1990; Yin, 1993) .",

An AWA would often initially operate a fleet consisting of one aircraft type that was handed down from the parent airline and reconfigured into a single class layout. Single class layouts ensured the maximum number of seats could be fitted to an aircraft, which lowered the per-seat cost for the AWA, as well as allowing for streamlined training and maintenance (Gados and Gillen, 2008) . Routes allocated to AWAs often mirrored the LCC strategy in that they offered point-to-point services which appealed to passengers as they could avoid time consuming transfers at congested mainline carrier hubs. Ideally, the routes also complimented those of the parent airlines to minimise cannibalisation. Cannibalisation in the airline industry involves an airline offering a product that directly competes with one of its existing products in a negative way and was raised as a major issue by Gados and Gillen (2008) .",

This decision is inappropriate as the mainline staff can be operating under restrictive union contracts which prevent the substantial pay cuts required to become more competitive against the LCCs (Morrell, 2005) . In certain cases, the unions would also limit AWA block flying hours and the amount of aircraft that they could operate, thus hindering the competitiveness of the AWA (Gados and Gillen, 2008) . The most successful AWAs from around the world, such as Jetstar, Silkair and Germanwings, all operate with high levels of autonomy from their parent airline (Graf, 2005; Pearson and Merkert, 2014) , have modern fleets, compliment their parent airlines' route networks and have staff on separate contracts to their mainline counterparts.",

Furthermore, these LCCs operated from secondary airports such as Houston-Hobby, Chicago-Midway and Dallas-Love Field, flew point-to-point services which bypassed congested and costly hubs, and used direct sales channels to reduce travel agent commissions (e.g. de Wit and Zuidberg, 2012; Francis et al., 2006; Graham and Vowles, 2006; Klophaus, Conrady and Fichert, 2012; Morrell, 2005) .",

However, as observed by Graf (2005) , Graham and Vowles (2006) , Homsombat et al.

This ensured a cohesive and coordinated approach to each market segment is maintained (Gados and Gillen, 2008; Harvey and Turnbull, 2006; Hill, 1988) . This approach enables an AWA's offering to best meet the market needs, increasing the likelihood of customer loyalty and retention, allowing access to a greater pool of customers, and improving revenue gathering potential (Christensen et al., 2002; Hill, 1988; Sorenson, 2000) .",

The four initial AWAs all used second hand aircraft that were handed down from their parent airlines, primarily Boeing 737-200s and McDonald Douglas DC-9s. The second group of AWAs established by the major American carriers in the early 2000s (Delta's Song and United's Ted) operated more modern Airbus A320s and Boeing 757 s (Morrell, 2005) . The primary issues with these aircraft were that they were older and not as fuel efficient as those used by their low-cost competitors, who were flying new and modern aircraft with improved operating credentials. In some cases these second hand aircraft were still configured in dual cabin layouts, which were not ideal for low-cost operations as the seat density needed to be as high as possible in order to achieve the lower per seat costs on par with the lowcost competition (Morrell, 2005; Pearson and Merkert, 2014) . High seat densities can only be achieved through mono-class layouts so it is essential that the first and business class cabins are omitted (Lindstadt and Fauser, 2004; Williams, 2001) .",

In the case of Denver based Ted, the AWA was merely cannibalising existing United Airlines' traffic and not competing successfully against Frontier Airlines, who was the primary low-cost competitor at the airport, and one of the main reasons why Ted was launched. Ideally, the AWAs in the USA would have found niche markets that would not involve head to head confrontations with LCCs or cannibalise their parent airlines' operations. Delta Airline's second AWA, Song, was more successful in this respect as it primarily operated nonstop services between New York City and destinations in Florida, bypassing the major hub of Delta Airlines in Atlanta, which allowed Song to compete more effectively against the rival LCC, JetBlue (Gados and Gillen, 2008; Homsombat et al., 2014) .",

Union restrictions placed on Metrojet limited the AWA to 25% of US Airways total block flying hours, which greatly reduced Metrojet's aircraft utilisation rate and overall competitiveness (Gados and Gillen, 2008) .

The organisation can also utilise this information in a strategic and targeted manner to develop a brand-portfolio designed to achieve a competitive advantage. With a successful dual or multi-brand strategy, an organisation can offer products and services that meet the evolving needs of customers, thus improving loyalty and increasing market share (Aaker, 1996; Kekre and Srinivasan, 1990) . Care must be taken, however, to ensure that the multiple brands are complimentary rather than competing. To do this, the parent organisation must clearly define the scope of each of the brands to ensure there is minimal overlap. Furthermore, these brands must then avoid cannibalising each other's target market, minimise the potential for confusion amongst customers through effective marketing, and not dilute their parent brands' values and earnings potential (e.g. Asberg, 2015; Jiang et al., 2002; Jing et al., 2008; Kumar, 2003; Manga and John, 2010; Morrin, 1999; Shocker et al., 1994; Wang and Chung, 2015) . To minimise the risk of these occurrences, Batey (2008) and Morgan and Rego (2009) suggested that only a limited number of brands should be offered and that each brand must have their own clear market segments with no overlap. In the airline industry, this could be an airline that only offers two distinctly branded airlines, one premium and one low-cost (i.e. the AWA strategy). A clear dual or multi-brand strategy that covers carefully selected market segments in a cost effective and efficient manner is a significant asset that can strengthen an organisation's market position, provide increased flexibility during exogenous shocks, and act as a strong deterrent to competitors who may have been contemplating entering that market (e.g. Aaker and Keller, 1990; Bordley, 2003; Dev, Morgan and Shoemaker, 1995; Eisenhart and Galunic, 2000; Lancaster, 1990; Morgan and Rego, 2009; Shocker et al., 1994) .",

The latter three carriers posed a considerable threat to Singapore Airlines' European, Australasian and Indian services, particularly as their premium cabin offerings and high levels of service quality mirrored those of Singapore Airlines (Fan and Lingblad, 2016; Nataraja and Al-Ali, 2011; Singapore Airlines, 2014 . These Middle Eastern carriers flew similar networks to Singapore Airlines and provided compelling transit options between Australia and Europe at their respective hubs of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Doha. Furthermore, these carriers were also taking a large portion of the lucrative Europe-Asia traffic from those continents' legacy airlines (Vespermann et al., 2008; O'Connell and Williams, 2011) . This is due to these carriers' unique geographic positioning which is within eight hours flying time of a large portion of the world's population (O'Connell and Williams, 2011) . Singapore Airlines responded to this threat by announcing additional product and service enhancements including on-board wireless internet (Wi-Fi), premium economy, and a refurbishment program for their Boeing 777 aircraft (Singapore Airlines, 2015).",

Its marketing efforts were focussed on Silkair being the leading leisure airline in Southeast Asia for quality. This focus on service quality meant that Silkair's cabin crew joined their Singapore Airlines counterparts in a customer service program in an effort to improve their offering to passengers (Singapore Airlines, 2008). Silkair's continued efforts in this area were recognised when they were presented with the title of 'Best Regional Airline' in 2008 for the 9th time from the TTG Asia Travel Awards (Singapore Airlines, 2009). Silkair further strengthened its coordination and collaboration with Singapore Airlines in the Indian and Southeast Asian markets, which resulted in increased bookings for both airlines.

The operations and key decisions made at Scoot are managed completely independently from Singapore Airlines (Singapore Airlines, 2011). Scoot's target low-cost market is within a six to eight hour radius of Singapore and includes destinations in Australia, China and Japan. The service to Athens which launched in 2017 was an exception. In addition, Scoot applied for an anti-trust immunity agreement with Tigerair in an effort to improve and strengthen coordination, pricing, and connectivity between the two airlines and allow for seamless passenger journeys (Singapore Airlines, 2015; Tigerair, 2014 Tigerair, , 2015 .

Externally, the US terrorist attacks in 2001 hampered demand for air services to the USA which resulted in Qantas reducing its services to Los Angeles and temporarily suspending flights to New York. These flights later returned to normal service levels in early 2002 (Qantas Airways, 2002) . Qantas's domestic services were also impacted negatively by this event due to the large number of international travellers that connect onto to onward domestic flights. The Bali bombings in 2002 heavily decreased demand to the resort city, which is incredibly popular with Australian tourists (Smyth et al., 2009) . Air travel demand was further hampered in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region during 2003 and 2004 as a result of the outbreak of SARS and the Boxing Day Tsunami (Abdulla et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2011) . These events in close proximity to one another resulted in Qantas reducing their flight operations by 20% across its international network in order to better reflect the lower demand for air travel. Some of the Asian routes most affected by SARS in particular faced reduced demand of up to 45% (Qantas Airways, 2003) . Heavy marketing was undertaken in an effort to re-grow the affected markets through a number of campaigns such as, 'Back to Thailand' and SARS recovery fares.",

This resulted in a number of Qantas routes being suspended in order to increase operational sustainability. For routes that remained in service, a number were transferred to Jetstar (its low-cost subsidiary) in order to improve their respective operating performance. This was particularly apparent in New Zealand, where all of Qantas' domestic services transitioned to Jetstar, and also in Cairns where the flights previously operated by Australian Airlines, such as services to Osaka and Nagoya, also became Jetstar flights (Qantas Airways, 2009; Whyte and Lohmann, 2015) . It was these types of decisions and strategies such as allocating specific destinations to a specific airline within the group that has ensured the longevity of the Qantas AWA operation. This is because there is a clear delineation between each carrier's roles in the group -Qantas focuses its attention on the premium markets such as Sydney while forgoing leisure routes such as those radiating from north Queensland to Jetstar. This is in stark contrast to United's Ted brand in the USA, which was based out of Denver (a United Airlines hub) and did not serve markets that were in any way different from mainline United, this in turn increased the risk of cannibalising United's routes. Ted was now in direct competition with its parent airline, which in turn weakened both airlines' respective brands because there were no clear product differences between the two carriers (Morrell, 2005) .",

These Boeing 717s were rapidly replaced with more efficient Airbus A320 aircraft. This is in contrast to the early US AWA examples that retained their initial second hand aircraft, such as inefficient Boeing 737-200 and BAe 146 aircraft, through to the end of their operations. This decision suggests that these AWAs were only intended to be a short term exercise, whereas the decision by the Qantas Group to purchase brand new aircraft for Jetstar's operations suggests a high level of long term commitment towards the low-cost brand. Later, the airline would commence flying to both short-haul and long-haul international leisure destinations with both Airbus A320s, A330s and later Boeing 787s (Danaher et al., 2011; Gross and Luck, 2016; Homsombat et al., 2014; Qantas Airways, 2004 ). Jetstar's purpose was to complement existing Qantas operations, allowing the group to compete more effectively with LCCs such as Virgin Blue and Tigerair Australia, and provide the group with an airline in each of the two remaining core travel markets (short-haul and long-haul low-cost air travel), as well as opening up air travel to the new and rapidly growing price-sensitive/budget market segment (Homsombat et al., 2014; Qantas Airways, 2003; Whyte and Prideaux, 2008; Whyte and Lohmann, 2015) .",

On the Sydney-Auckland route, Qantas offers up to five daily flights versus Jetstar's single daily flight. On the Singapore-Bangkok route, the flights are split evenly between the full service and low-cost members of the Singapore Airlines Group due to Bangkok being both a strong business and leisure destination.

Holverson and Revaz (2006) believed that by undertaking extensive market research a greater understanding of how fragmented a market was could be gained. The outcome of this research would allow numerous brands to then be offered to the market, and a product and service offering to be selected that best met a specific market's geographic and demographic needs (Gilmore and Pine, 2002; Kandampully and Suhartanto, 2000; Wang and Chung, 2015) . However, like the hotel industry, it is critical that the airlines regularly monitor the markets they serve and the respective product offerings as market needs change and investment in new technology and comfort will be necessary to continue to compete effectively (Kwun, 2010; Luo and Rui, 2009 ). The airlines that can foresee changes and act on them in the timeliest manner will be in an ideal position going forward to compete effectively against the competition.

Primarily, they were created to exploit the low-cost travel segment and the growing LCCs in the Asia-Pacific region that each airline group acknowledged would be difficult to compete against and serve passengers with their premium product and service offering. The desire to establish the AWA strategy in Asia-Pacific was also compelling as the market was experiencing a surge in air travel demand of at least 5.5% per annum on average (ICAO, 2012) . This surge can be attributed to increased lowcost competition, a growing middle class with disposable income and poor surface transport options which increased the appeal of air travel as a safe and convenient mode of transportation. ICAO expects this growth rate to continue until 2032 (Ahmad, 2010; Bowen, 2016; Pearson et al., 2015a,b) . The result of this considerable low-cost segment growth was that the two airline groups needed to somehow specifically tailor their respective product and service offerings to meet the less premium needs of this growing price-sensitive passenger group, but in a sustainable manner. This was too difficult to achieve with their parent airlines only having premium configured aircraft, higher crewing costs and more comprehensive on-board service offerings. Thus, the appeal to create and deploy the AWA strategy as a competitive response with aircraft and products and services that were designed exclusively to meet the needs of this new low-cost market segment was highly desirable.",

This high level of autonomy (i.e. independent management) is achieved by creating a separate airline (a subsidiary) within the same group as the parent airline (Gados and Gillen, 2008) . In turn, this strategy allowed the subsidiary airline to manage their critical operations such as branding, staff training (e.g. pilot recruitment), route network and fleet selection separately from the parent airline, which in turn allowed them to make decisions that best met their respective market needs.",

            "text": "This high level of autonomy allowed the AWAs of the Singapore Airlines Group and the Qantas Group to overcome the challenging issue of offering a product that is \"Stuck in the middle\", a concept which Cronshaw et al. (1994) and Porter (1980) suggested occurs when the product and services offered are neither full service nor low-cost. The result of being \"Stuck in the middle\" is that consumers become confused about what they are purchasing and can struggle to find value in the offered products and services. The two groups' respective AWAs overcame this issue by being branded completely separately from their parent airlines (i.e. Scoot vs. Singapore Airlines rather than Continental-Lite vs. Continental), and they clearly advertise their own separate product and service offerings to their respective target markets. However, each AWA still adheres to their groups' overarching strategic objectives, this ensures minimal cannibalisation and duplication of resources occurs. This has minimised the risk of passengers becoming confused or disappointed in regards to what airlines they are travelling on, or the type of on-board products and services they are expecting as the branding and respective marketing is so distinct and individual with no obvious ties to the parent airlines. This high level of autonomy has allowed the AWAs of both airline groups to focus all their resources on their intended market segments, whilst still operating in a cohesive and coordinated manner alongside their parent airlines and their respective strategies, which Gados and Gillen (2008) , Harvey and Turnbull (2006) and Hill (1988) agreed is of significant importance as it allows for a stronger competitive response to be used against the rapidly growing low-cost competition.",

However, should this strategy be adopted, it must be approached with caution as it can be a costly drain on resources as well as potentially harm an airline group's brand and reputation if implemented incorrectly. The Singapore Airlines Group and the Qantas Group have successfully proven that dual or multiple airline brands can be operated simultaneously without damaging other airlines within the same group, which in turn has allowed the two groups to successfully compete against the fierce low-cost competition in the Asia-Pacific region. This strategy has given each group increased operational flexibility to tailor their respective products and services to individual market segments rather than expecting the markets to accept a single premium product which they could only offer previously.",

As a result, these AWAs are nimble and are more akin to their low-cost competitors than their US predecessors ever could have been, this in turn has allowed the Singapore Airlines Group and Qantas Group to strategically capitalise on this previously challenging market segment in a profitable and sustainable manner.",

The hotel industry regularly reviews their product and service offerings and undertakes continuous innovation to ensure that they maintain a competitive and fresh portfolio that appeals to a wide variety of guests. This approach of the hotel industry is needed for the AWA strategy in the airline industry and, importantly, both the Singapore Airlines and Qantas Groups have demonstrated they are prepared to undertake continuous innovation in order to retain their competitive advantage. Both groups have regularly updated their seat and on-board products and services at least every five years. This study contributes to the growing amount of aviation literature which is focused on the AWA strategy by using two 21st century airline case studies to illustrate the critical attributes required for this strategy to be successful against the rapid growth of the low-cost airline segment in the Asia-Pacific region. It further illustrates the common attributes that can lead to the AWA strategy failing and potentially undermining the parent airline's operations.",

With continued innovation and monitoring of the volatile and challenging aviation market conditions, the AWAs of the two airline groups are believed to have the necessary resources and capabilities to continue to be successful in the future.
