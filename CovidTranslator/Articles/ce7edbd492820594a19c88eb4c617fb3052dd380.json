The present results showed that the seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG and anti-HEV IgM in schizophrenia were significantly higher than that in healthy controls. Anti-HEV IgG positivity increased with age and with the duration of disease in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, schizophrenia patients with increased CD4 ? /CD8 ? T-cell ratios ([2.03) had higher anti-HEV IgG detection rates than those with normal ratios (1.05-2.03). Compared with the schizophrenia patients who tested anti-HEV IgG negative, the levels of interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 (Th2 cytokines) were significantly higher, while the interleukin-12 (Th1 cytokine) level was significantly lower, in those with anti-HEV IgG positivity. Of five schizophrenia patients who were anti-HEV IgM positive, four had elevated CD4 ? /CD8 ? T-cell ratios. HEV RNA was isolated from one of these four patients and classified as genotype 4. Anti-HEV IgM positivity was not detected among healthy controls. Therefore, schizophrenia patients exhibited a higher risk of HEV infection than controls.",

Hepatitis E, caused by HEV, is an important public-health problem in many developing countries and is the cause of sporadic acute hepatitis in developed countries. Although the overall mortality of hepatitis E is less than 1 % in the general population, it can reach up to 19 % in pregnant women in the third trimester [19] . HEV infection has four documented routes of transmission: waterborne, foodborne, bloodborne and vertical transmission from mother to child [1, 2, 12, 33] . Epidemiological studies indicate that a higher prevalence of HEV antibodies is observed in the elderly and people who live in rural areas with poor sanitation [4, 24] . Moreover, isolation of animal strains of HEV and the existence of other animal species that tested seropositive for anti-HEV IgG and IgM indicate that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease [6, 27] .",

Immune system abnormalities have been reported in patients with schizophrenia, as evidenced by increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, T-cell activation and high levels of autoantibodies [23] . The alterations of circulating inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-c (IFN-c), reflecting the functions of T help type 1 (Th1), and interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), reflecting the functions of T help type 2 (Th2), were also observed in previous studies [23, 30] . Moreover, the previous results suggested there was an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 with a shift toward the Th2 system in schizophrenia [30] . Epidemiological studies have already shown that the rates of hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infection in patients with schizophrenia were five and 11 times higher, respectively, than the estimated general population rates [26] . However, the risk of hepatitis E virus infection in schizophrenia is still unknown. In the current study, we found that the detection rates for HEV antibodies in schizophrenia patients were much higher than those in healthy controls. Anti-HEV IgG positivity increased with age and with the duration of schizophrenia. Moreover, schizophrenic patients with increased ratios of CD4 ? /CD8 ? T cells had higher anti-HEV IgG detection rates than those with normal ratios. Compared with patients who tested anti-HEV IgG negative, the levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly higher, while the IL-12 level was significantly lower in those with anti-HEV IgG positivity.",

In previous studies, higher prevalence of antibodies to HBV nucleocapsid protein was seen in patients with psychiatric disorders [26] . Epidemiological studies also proved that patients with schizophrenia were significantly more likely to be infected with HCV than those without schizophrenia [13, 26] . Moreover, higher seroprevalence of antibodies to cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus and coronaviruses were found in psychotic patients compared to the general population [3, 8, 18, 21, 25, 28, 29] . Therefore, it was reasonable for us to carry out the present study to evaluate the risk of HEV infection in patients with schizophrenia. The results confirmed our hypothesis that anti-HEV IgG and IgM detection rates in schizophrenia were significantly higher than in healthy controls. Several factors could contribute to higher detection rates of HEV antibody in schizophrenia patients. First, some symptoms of schizophrenia, in particular, the symptoms of cognitive impairment, may contribute directly to an inability to safeguard against the transmission of waterborne, foodborne or bloodborne infection [10] . Second, schizophrenia patients usually reside in settings such as psychiatric facilities, where they often forge social relationships with other higher-risk individuals [8, 25] . Third, financial instability and poverty are also associated with increased risks of HEV infection [4] .",

Chronic hepatitis E infection has also been documented in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplantation and those infected with HIV [15] . The immune responses to HEV involve antibody-mediated immunity, cell-mediated immunity, interferon and other host defenses [5, 7, 14, 22] . Data from cellular immune responses to HEV suggest that the CD8 ? T-cell count is significantly higher in recovered HEV-infected individuals than in acutely infected HEV patients and the general population, but the levels of CD4 ? T-cells are similar in these groups [14, 22, 34] . In schizophrenia, increased levels of CD4 ? T cells and higher CD4 ? /CD8 ? T-cell ratios were documented previously [30] . In the present study, the detection rate of anti-HEV IgG in schizophrenia patients with increased CD4 ? /CD8 ? T-cell ratios ([2.03) was significantly higher than in patients with normal ratios (1.05 * 2.03). Thus, further well-designed studies should be carried out to analyze the relationships between CD4 ? /CD8 ? T-cell levels and the increased risk of HEV infection in schizophrenia patients.",

In hepatitis B and C virus infections, the predominant immune response, which is Th1, is activated during liver trauma [20] . According to Pal et al. [22] , IFN-c, a Th1 cytokine, was lower in HEV-infected pregnant women than in healthy people. Furthermore, the production of IL-4, a Th2 cytokine, was higher in HEV-infected pregnant women than in controls [22] . These results suggest that pregnant women with acute HEV infection show a shift in the Th1/ Th2 balance towards a Th2 response. This shift might play a role in the particularly severe clinical course and mortality of the HEV infection during late pregnancy. It should be noted that schizophrenia might also be associated with an imbalance in Th1/Th2 cytokines, and also with a shift toward the Th2 system [30] . In the present study, the Th2 bias was observed in schizophrenia patients, as evidenced by the increased production of IL-4 and IL-10 and lower IL-12 production. Moreover, significant differences of the serum IL-4, IL-10 and IL-12 levels were observed among schizophrenia patients with and without HEV IgG antibodies.",

Also, there are several limitations in our present study. First, the various drugs used in schizophrenia may affect the immune system, and virtually all our schizophrenia patients were on this type of medication. Relationships between drugs and immune bias, and the effect of this relationship on the risk of HEV infection in schizophrenia should be assessed in the future. Second, we did not include inflammatory markers other than serum IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-c, and thus, future work should be carefully interpreted in the light of this. Third, larger numbers of schizophrenia patients and controls as well as long-term follow-up will be required to further analyze the increased risk of HEV infection in schizophrenia. Taken together, schizophrenia patients exhibited higher risk of HEV infection than controls in the present study. Anti-HEV IgG seropositivity increased with age and with the duration of illness. Moreover, schizophrenia patients with increased CD4 ? /CD8 ? T-cell ratios had higher anti-HEV IgG detection rates than those with normal ratios. The levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly higher, while the IL-12 level was significantly lower in schizophrenia patients with anti-HEV IgG positivity than in those who were antibody negative. In order to understand the questions behind the observed associations, further work is needed, with larger samples and longitudinal follow-ups.",
