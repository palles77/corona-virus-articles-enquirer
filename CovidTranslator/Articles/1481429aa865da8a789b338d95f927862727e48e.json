Traditional approaches for pathogen detection, however, often require time-intensive bacterial culture and amplification procedures. Herein, a microparticle enhanced double-stranded DNA probe is demonstrated for rapid species-specific detection of bacterial 16S rRNA. In this molecular assay, the binding of the target sequence to the fluorophore conjugated probe thermodynamically displaces the quencher probe and allows the fluorophore to fluoresce. By incorporation of streptavidin-coated microparticles to localize the biotinylated probes, the sensitivity of the assay can be improved by 3 orders of magnitude. The limit of detection of the assay is as few as eight bacteria without target amplification and is highly specific against other common pathogens. Its applicability toward clinical diagnostics is demonstrated by directly identifying bacterial pathogens in urine samples from patients with urinary tract infections.",

            "text": "Infectious disease caused by bacterial pathogens is a major healthcare challenge worldwide. For instance, urinary tract infection (UTI), which is the most common bacterial infection of any organ system, 1-3 accounts for seven million office visits and more than one million hospital admissions each year. 4 For clinical management of infectious diseases, identification and quantification of bacterial pathogens in patient-derived samples are required to assess the severity of the infection. The standard method for identifying pathogenic agents in clinical samples, such as urine in UTI, requires transportation of the samples to a central microbiology laboratory. After overnight culture, the bacterial colonies are counted and identified based on morphology and other phenotypic parameters. A major shortcoming of the standard culture-based diagnostic approach is the significant delay of at least 2-3 days from sample collection to result reporting. The absence of definitive microbiological diagnosis has largely driven the over-and misuse of antibiotics. The development of specific and sensitive molecular biosensing techniques for rapid detection of bacterial pathogens would revolutionize the clinical practice of UTI and other infectious diseases by allowing evidence-based, rather than empiric, management of infectious diseases and effective treatment to the patients.",

On the other hand, development of rapid bacterial detection strategies toward point-of-care applications has been receiving increasing attention due to the time and labor intensive protocols associated with most of the existing assays. In particular, assays that are free of separation, amplification, and bacterial culture are highly desirable.

            "text": "Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) probe is a homogeneous assay for rapid detection of specific nucleic acid sequences and can potentially be applied for pathogen identification. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] In the dsDNA sensing scheme, a DNA sequence containing a fluorophore labeled on the 5\u2032 end is designed to be complementary to the nucleotide sequence of interest. To allow homogeneous detection of the target, a complementary sequence is designed with respect to the fluorophore probe but with a shorter length and its 3\u2032 end is labeled with a quencher. In the absence of the target, the fluorophore and quencher probes are in close proximity diminishing the fluorescence signal. With the target, the quencher probe is replaced due to the thermodynamically driven binding event between the fluorophore probe and the target. Therefore, the fluorophore is separated from the quencher and is able to fluoresce. Compared to other homogeneous assays for nucleic acids, such as a molecular beacon, advantages of dsDNA probes include the possibility of adjusting the quencher-to-fluorophore ratio for noise minimization and the flexibility of modifying the lengths of the quencher sequence and the sticky end for improving the specificity and kinetics of the assay. The dsDNA probes have been demonstrated in various biomedical applications, including detection of single nucleotide mismatches, quantification of PCR products, and quantification of DNA binding proteins. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] However, most dsDNA assays require target amplification, such as PCR, to improve the sensitivity, and the applicability of dsDNA probes for rapid detection of bacterial pathogens has not been demonstrated. This is partially due to the limited sensitivity of the assay, which is often a result of the strong background in the biological sample, as a washing step is not involved in the homogeneous assay. This is particularly challenging for detecting pathogen in clinical samples such as urine and serum, which is known to have a strong matrix effect. 30, 31 This represents a major technical hurdle for applying dsDNA probes and other homogeneous assays for quantifying bacterial pathogens without amplification or bacterial culture.",

The fluorophore probe was designed to bind specifically to the loop region of the 16S rRNA, and the quencher probe is complementary to the fluorophore probe. The fluorophore and quencher sequences of the E. coli probes were 24 and 12 bases in length, respectively. As previously shown, these lengths are optimized for both improvement of thermodynamically driven replacement between the target and quencher and reduction of nonspecific binding. 27 The fluorophore probe was labeled with biotin and fluorophore, TAMRA(NHS Ester), in the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends, respectively. The fluorophore can be excited at 559 nm and has an emission peak at 583 nm.

In order to minimize the background level, the concentration of the quencher probe relative to the concentration of the fluorophore probe (quencher-to-fluorophore ratio) was adjusted systematically to minimize the concentration of free fluorophore probe in the solution ( Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The background fluorescence generally diminishes with the quencher-to-fluorophore ratio. The fluorescence intensity is minimized when the quencher-to-fluorophore ratio reaches 3-to-1 ratio and a further increase in the ratio does not show significant reduction of the fluorescence intensity. A higher quencherto-fluorophore ratio can affect the probe sensitivity and shifts the dynamic range to the higher target concentration. This is consistent with our previous theoretical and experimental studies that a 3-to-1 ratio allows a high signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, two different fluorophores, 6-FAM (excitation 495 nm/emission 520 nm) and TAMIN (excitation 559 nm/ emission 583 nm), were examined for reducing the background noise. In our experiment, TAMIN was shown to have a better signal-to-noise ratio (data not shown). It is likely a result of the strong autofluorescence from cellular components as well as the bacterial growth media at the shorter wavelength. As a result, TAMIN is used in all the other experiments.",

To evaluate its ability for bacterial detection, we have conducted experiments with the dsDNA probe to detect 16S rRNA from E. coli. The result is shown in Figure 3 . The titration curve for detecting bacterial 16S rRNA displays a similar trend compared to the titration curve for detecting synthetic target. The dynamic range of the assay is 10 7 to 10 4 cfu with a LOD (95%) of 10 520 cfu in a 100 \u03bcL volume sample (Table S2 in the Supporting  Information) .

In general, the microparticle-enhanced dsDNA probe achieves a higher signal than merely the dsDNA probe at every single target concentration tested. Similarly, the assay has a dynamic range across several orders of magnitude in concentration. With utilization of the microparticles, the minimum target concentration that is distinguishable from the background noise is on the order of femtomolar. Statistical analysis shows the LOD of the assay is 4.5 fM, which is 1000-fold better than that achieved by the dsDNA probe itself (Table S2 in the Supporting Information). This result suggests that the microparticle provides a simple and effective approach to enhance the sensitivity of the dsDNA probe assay without target amplification. The microparticle enhanced assay was also evaluated for its capability to detect E. coli. The result is shown in Figure 5 . Similar to the synthetic target experiment, we observed a significant improvement in the sensitivity of the assay compared to the dsDNA probe alone. The LOD of the assay is estimated to be 8 cfu in a 100 \u03bcL sample (i.e., 80 cfu/mL), which is equivalent to 2.6 fM of 16S rRNA.

To avoid the culture step for rapid detection, a molecular assay for point-of-care diagnostics should be insensitivity to the matrix effect. To test the ability of the microparticle enhanced dsDNA assay to detect bacteria directly from physiological samples, two clinical urine samples from UTI patients with 10 8 cfu/mL E. coli and 10 7 cfu/mL P. mirabilis bacteria, respectively, were tested (Figure 7) . The relative intensity of the clinical urine sample with E. coli is significantly higher than that with both P. mirabilis bacteria and negative control. The intensity of the sample with P. mirabilis cannot be distinguished from the signal in the negative control. These results indicate that the microparticle enhanced assay is capable of specific detection of the target bacteria in urine and is not affected by the matrix effects.",

Within this context, we have demonstrated a homogeneous dsDNA probe to rapidly quantify bacteria. Bacterial 16S rRNA was chosen as the target for molecular analysis due to its high copy numbers in bacteria. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene sequences are well characterized with regions of interspecies diversity that are useful for probe design to differentiate different bacterial species. 36 As a proof of concept, we designed the dsDNA probe for E. coli and tested it with clinical isolates and urine samples from UTI patients. As demonstrated in this study, the probe has good specificity against other common bacteria and sample matrix from clinical samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the applicability of dsDNA probes for specific detection of bacterial 16S rRNA. Compared to other hybridization assays that detect the species-specific bacterial 16S rRNA, 3, 24, 35, 37, 38 the dsDNA probe dramatically simplifies the assay protocol and is particularly suitable in resource limited settings, such as rural clinics and temporary clinics at a disaster zone.",

Our results show that the combination of microparticles and dsDNA probes leads to a highly sensitive and specific optical biosensor for bacteria identification and quantification. Because of the small sample volume in this assay, the detection limit is reported in terms of absolute number of bacteria instead of bacterial concentrations. Without microparticles, the assay requires over 10 4 bacteria for pathogen identification. When the molecular probes are localized with microparticles, the sensitivity of the probe can be improved for over 1000-fold. Similar concepts were applied in a molecular beacon-labeled micro-sphere assay for detecting synthetic nucleic acid sequences that mimic SARS coronavirus. 39 On the other hand, we demonstrate that microparticles can be combined with the dsDNA probe for improving its sensitivity for over 3 orders of magnitude and less than 10 bacteria are required for pathogen identification. The improvement in the sensitivity allows direct detection of bacteria without overnight culture or target amplification procedures.",
