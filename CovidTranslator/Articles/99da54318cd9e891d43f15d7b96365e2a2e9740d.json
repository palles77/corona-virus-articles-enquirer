            "text": "Influenza-like illness (ILI) occurs annually worldwide, but peak timing and severity of the epidemic vary seasonally. 1 Although surveillance for antigenic drift or influenza-virus shift is intense, annual mortality still exceeds 250 000 and results usually from complications, such as pneumonia, neurological events and circulatory failure. 2 Seasonal influenza epidemics peak during the winter in temperate latitudes of both the northern and southern hemispheres. By contrast, tropical countries might experience two annual peaks, with shorter and less intense epidemics. 3 4 Moreover, previous studies showed that influenza activity is frequently out of phase with the hemispherical winter in many tropical regions and some temperate ones, with the consequence that optimal timing for routine influenza-vaccination recommendations does not necessarily correspond to the activity expected for that hemisphere. 5 strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba This study used the same model of active surveillance applied in other outside centres allowing subsequent comparisons on the impact of influenza and other respiratory viruses in hospitalised patients worldwide. \u25ba More information was added on seasonality and severity of the influenza disease in South America, whose data are limited. \u25ba Our data reinforce the growing consensus that vaccinations in Northeast Brazil are being carried out in a post-seasonal period, with consequent low effectiveness. \u25ba The low inclusion of patients in Rio de Janeiro that does not allow for an assessment of the impact of viral respiratory infections in southeastern Brazil. \u25ba The study was carried out with data collected in 1 year, which limits predictions on the impact of influenza longitudinally in these locales.",

            "text": "Brazil, which includes temperate and tropical regions, exhibits an important regional heterogeneity in influenza peak. 6 7 Seasonal influenza epidemics are usually associated with 'cold-dry' and 'humid-rainy' climates; 8 however, in addition to climate and environmental conditions, host factors, such as age, pre-existing immunity, genetic polymorphisms and presence of comorbidities, are associated with seasonal variations of this infection, vaccine responsiveness, as well as the severity of influenza epidemics. 9 Vaccination is the main public health measure used to reduce the frequency of severe influenza cases. 2 In Brazil, influenza vaccination has been performed annually since 1999. Initially, immunisation targeted individuals aged \u226565 years; however, in 2000, the age limit was lowered to 60 years. In 2016, the Brazilian Ministry of Health extended the recommendation to children <5 years, pregnant women, people with chronic non-communicable diseases and health professionals. [10] [11] [12] Overall, in 2015, national immunisation campaigns achieved a vaccination coverage of 82.7% in priority groups. 13 The Global Influenza Hospital-based Surveillance Network (GIHSN) is a public-private partnership between research institutes, hospitals and several laboratories around the world, and was established to study the epidemiology of severe influenza in consecutive seasons in different countries. (http://www. gihsn. org/? page= map). In 2015, this network comprised a total of 31 collaborating sites from seven countries, including Brazil. All participants follow the same core investigation protocol developed by the GIHSN scientific committee. Through broad geographical coverage and data standardisation, the GIHSN group seeks to obtain a global picture of the impact of influenza on patients with respiratory pathologies. Additionally, this network provides invaluable tools to investigate the seasonality of influenza in regions where this information is not available, as well as a framework for estimating the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines in preventing severe cases among age and risk groups.",

Overall, different respiratory viruses were found in 59% of the tested samples. This was consistent with previous reports showing high co-circulation of ORV in hospitalised patients during the influenza season, and confirmed that the viruses detected caused very similar ILI respiratory manifestations. [19] [20] [21] Moreover, our results reflected the profile of respiratory viruses in children, which was the predominant group included in the study. Interestingly, although circulation of influenza and ORV coincided over time, the frequency of co-detection of influenza with ORV was very low, whereas co-detection of more than one ORV in a single patient was rather common along with RSV. This observation was consistent with those in our previous reports, and we hypothesise that low co-detection of influenza with other ORVs in these hospitalised patients was likely due to the higher pathogenicity of influenza. 20 22 We then compared clinical and epidemiological data from patients with influenza infection and patients with ORV infection to evaluate the impact of these infections. Influenza was significantly more frequent in older patients and those with severe diseases, whereas comorbidities were associated with ORV infections. These findings reflected a lower adhesion to immunisation among older children, with the presence of severe disease a possible consequence of the higher virulence of influenza viruses, although no difference in mortality was observed between both groups. This contrasted with results from a previous study performed in Fortaleza, showing significant association between RSV infections and infant mortality. 23 We believe that such a discrepancy might be due to the low number of positive cases observed in the present study.",

A previous study identified a seasonal southward-travelling wave across Brazil (from equatorial to temperate regions), suggesting that environmental issues play more important roles than population factors, such as immune function and levels of vitamin D, in driving influenza epidemics in the country. 6 Understanding the dispersion dynamics of influenza viruses in tropical regions is considered of crucial importance, given that several reports suggested that in these regions, influenza activity is more temporally diffuse and might contain foci for the emergence of new variants. 6 7 27 In addition to the need for a different influenza-immunisation schedule in Brazil, the composition of this vaccine should also be evaluated, because the antigenic composition for this region might differ from that recommended for the temperate region. 7 However, information on strains circulating in tropical regions remains scarce, because most countries in these regions have low income, and health surveillance is not completely employed. Additionally, policies and resources need to be established to overcome the logistical challenges to implementing national immunisation programmes using different calendars and distinct antigenic compositions in Brazil. 7 This study contained some limitations. Patient recruitment during the seasonal period of influenza previously defined for two sites (Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro) might have contributed to low FLUB detection, although the frequency observed here was similar to that reported by the national surveillance programme. Additionally, the study was performed using data collected over the course of 1 year, which limited predictions of the impact of influenza longitudinally in these locales. There was a predominance of paediatric patients in the study population; therefore, data concerning ORV reflect mainly the profile of respiratory viruses in children. The low number of patients from Rio de Janeiro did not allow for an assessment of the impact and seasonality of viral respiratory infections in that region. Finally, the monitoring of weather conditions was performed by organisations linked to the states of each region of the country, therefore limiting the description of data to that from similar information made available by these institutions.",
