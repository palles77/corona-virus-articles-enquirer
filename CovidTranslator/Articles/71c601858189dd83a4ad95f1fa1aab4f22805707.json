Replication of the viral genome by the nonstructural proteins starts with synthesis of complementary negative-strand RNA molecules, which then serve as a template for the production of multiple new +RNA molecules. Newly synthesized +RNA genomes either enter another round of translation and replication or are assembled with capsid proteins into progeny virions. The new virions are released into the extracellular environment upon host cell lysis, although growing evidence suggests that virions can also be secreted via nonlytic release prior to cell lysis and transmitted in vesicles containing multiple virions [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , similar to the mode observed previously for the picornavirus hepatitis A virus (genus Hepatovirus) [13] .",

However, two recent electron tomography studies on poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) have revealed the three-dimensional structure of ROs ( Figure 1 ) [19, 20] . Interestingly, the morphology of the ROs transforms during the course of infection, indicating that ROs are dynamic structures. The first structures detected upon infection are single-membrane tubules. As infection progresses, the tubules transform into double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), which are subsequently enwrapped by more tubules to yield multilamellar structures. It remains to be established whether all these different structures support viral RNA replication. At least the tubular structures seem to do so, as the appearance of tubular ROs is concomitant with the exponential increase in viral RNA [19] .",

The emergence of tubular ROs coincides with the disappearance of Golgi membranes, implying that Golgi components might be involved in RO formation [19] . Additionally, the formation of DMVs and their subsequent enwrapping are reminiscent of autophagic mechanisms, suggesting that autophagy plays a role in RO transformation [19, 20] . In accordance with this, a number of Golgi proteins [21] [22] [23] and the autophagy marker LC3 [9, 24, 25] were found on enterovirus ROs.

The genus Cardiovirus includes encephalomyocarditis virus, which can infect many hosts, including rodents and pigs, and cause encephalomyelitis and reproductive failure, as well as saffold virus, a human virus that has not been convincingly associated with a disease. The genus Aphthovirus includes the foot-and-mouth disease virus, which infects a range of cloven-hooved mammals and which causes lesions, but sometimes also myocarditis and death. Other well-known human picornaviruses are the hepatitis A virus (Hepatovirus genus), which causes hepatitis, human parechovirus (Parechovirus genus), which causes respiratory illness, gastroenteritis, myocarditis and encephalitis, and aichivirus (Kobuvirus genus), which causes gastroenteritis. and -independent manner [26] .

            "text": "The Essential Role of PI4KB and PI4P in Genome Replication Phosphoinositides are major determinants of organelle identity and functioning, despite accounting for only a minor fraction of the total cellular phospholipids. One of the most abundant phosphoinositides in the cell is phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). Recently, PI4P emerged from simply being a precursor of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P 2 ] to being a key regulator of membrane trafficking and metabolism, particularly by mediating the recruitment to membranes of effector proteins with lipid-transfer functions [32] . PI4P can be synthesized in mammalian cells by four distinct phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks) [32] , type II and type III that both consist of an /and a b-isoform [33] , which reside at different subcellular locations and locally synthesize PI4P. The major pool of PI4P is generated in Golgi membranes, where PI4K type IIIb (PI4KB) is the predominant isoform [34, 35] . All enteroviruses depend on PI4KB activity for genome replication [23, 36] . PI4KB is accumulated at ROs by viral nonstructural proteins to locally produce high amounts of PI4P [23] . The small viral protein 3A mediates PI4KB accumulation [23, [37] [38] [39] , although 2BC was recently proposed to also play a role [40] . Of note, host factor accumulation is generally denoted 'recruitment', although it may also result from retention, or a combination of both.",

In uninfected cells, activation of Arf1 by GBF1 among others serves to recruit the COPI vesicle coat complex [47] . However, enterovirus ROs are gradually depleted of COPI [23, 38] , which exemplifies the selective recruitment of host factors to ROs.

MCSs have important functions in signaling and in the transfer of lipids and ions between organelles [89] . Many different types of MCS have been described between a variety of organelles, including ER-Golgi, ER-lipid droplet, ER-mitochondrion, and ERplasma membrane (PM) ( Figure I ). Specialized proteins (dynamically) bridge and/or regulate the distance between opposing membranes in response to triggers (e.g., Ca 2+ ), thus allowing spatiotemporal control of MCSs. MCS proteins include OSBP-related proteins (ORPs; these proteins regulate MCSs and shuttle lipids, including cholesterol) [71, 72] and extended synaptotagmins (E-syts; regulate ER-PM MCSs in response to Ca 2+ ) [90] , but our understanding of MCSs is currently limited, and many MCS proteins remain to be identified and characterized. this, other studies showed that enterovirus replication is not sensitive to Arf1 depletion and that overexpression of different Arf proteins cannot relieve virus replication from BFA inhibition [42, 43] . Additionally, overexpression of a truncated variant of GBF1 containing an intact N terminus, but lacking the catalytic Sec7 domain, could partially rescue poliovirus replication from the inhibitory effect of BFA [48] . Whatever function GBF1 plays in enterovirus replication, it might be related to the functioning rather than the formation of ROs, because poliovirus proteins expressed in the presence of BFA induced membrane rearrangements indistinguishable from those found in infected cells [43] . A deeper understanding of the role of GBF1 in enterovirus replication might also prove insightful for the as yet unclear role of GBF1 in the life cycle of other distantly related (+)RNA viruses, such as hepatitis C virus and coronaviruses [49, 50] .",

However, PI4KB was still recruited to ROs in CVB3-infected cells depleted of ACBD3, implying that enteroviruses recruit PI4KB independently of ACBD3 [37, 38] . To date, the importance of ACBD3 for enterovirus infection remains elusive, since two different studies demonstrated that ACBD3 depletion did not inhibit, but instead mildly augmented, replication of CVB3 and poliovirus [37, 52] , while in another report poliovirus replication was inhibited, albeit modestly, upon ACBD3 knockdown [39] .",

A first indication that PI4P might serve as a protein-docking site on RO membranes was the finding that CVB3 3D pol specifically bound to PI4P in an in vitro assay [23] , but this observation awaits validation in infected cells. By recruiting proteins, PI4P could assist in concentrating components required for genome replication and/or RO formation. Notably, PI4P can recruit cellular proteins that have a PI4P-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, including various lipid-transfer proteins [56, 57] . One of these is the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP). In uninfected cells, OSBP simultaneously binds the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trans-Golgi membranes, thus bringing them in close proximity and creating MCSs. OSBP interacts with the integral ER membrane proteins VAP-A and VAP-B through its FFAT-motif, while it docks to PI4P and Arf1 in the trans-Golgi via its PH-domain. OSBP binds cholesterol in a pocket in its sterol-binding domain and transports it to Golgi membranes. This cholesterol transfer occurs against the concentration gradient and hence requires energy. This energy is provided by a counterflux of PI4P, which binds in the same pocket of OSBP as cholesterol, from Golgi to ER, where it is hydrolyzed by the phosphatase Sac1 [58] .",

However, enteroviruses do not depend on ongoing cholesterol synthesis in the ER [60, 66] . This raises the question: where does RO cholesterol come from? So far, two cholesterol pools have been linked to replication: cholesterol stored in lipid droplets [60] , and cholesterol internalized from the medium or the plasma membrane pool [65] . Lipid droplets are consumed during enterovirus replication to mobilize the stored cholesterylester as a source of free cholesterol [60] . As of yet, it is not known how cholesterol from lipid droplets gets to the ER, and whether MCSs play a role in this. Interestingly, GBF1 and the Arf1/COPI machinery act directly on lipid droplets and are important for lipid droplet-targeting of key enzymes involved in lipid droplet homeostasis [67] . Modulation of the GBF1 and Arf1/COPI machinery by the viral protein 3A may therefore deter lipid storage and promote lipolysis to increase the availability of free cholesterol (and other stored lipids) as building blocks for membrane biogenesis. In addition, enteroviruses were shown to upregulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis [68] to enhance cholesterol (re)uptake from medium/plasma membrane [65] . Internalized cholesterol is delivered to ROs via recycling endosomes, possibly involving an interaction between PI4KIIIb and the recycling endosome protein Rab11. To date, it has not been established how exactly cholesterol is delivered from recycling endosomes to ROs. Possibly, cholesterol is shuttled at MCSs between recycling endosomes and ROs by cholesterol-transfer proteins, although it cannot be excluded that recycling endosomes fuse with the ROs.",

Cholesterol is an essential lipid for cellular membranes and is important for membrane properties such as fluidity, permeability, and the formation of membrane microdomains (rafts). Hence, cholesterol may be required to generate and maintain essential membrane properties that drive RO shape and function. For example, it has been proposed that cholesterol is required for efficient viral polyprotein processing [65] . Acute depletion of cholesterol with methyl-b-cyclodextrins or disruption of cholesterol organization with filipin enhanced the proteolytic processing of the viral precursor protein 3CD pro to 3C pro and 3D pol , thereby reducing the amount of 3CD pro , which is required for priming viral RNA synthesis and processing of the capsid proteins. Treatment with the PI4KB inhibitor GW5074, which reduces PI4P and hence OSBP recruitment and cholesterol accumulation at ROs, also affected in vitro polyprotein processing and resulted in an accumulation of the large precursor P2-P3 [69] . Similar to cholesterol depletion, GW5074 treatment decreased the level of 3CD pro and concomitantly increased the amount of 3D pol .",

Notably, OSBP regulates the ceramide transfer protein (CERT)-dependent shuttling of ceramide (a precursor of sphingomyelin, a lipid that associates with cholesterol in membrane microdomains) from ER to trans-Golgi [70] . It remains to be determined whether CERT and other machinery derived from the ER-Golgi MCS, and the lipids that depend on those lipid-transfer proteins, play a role in enterovirus replication. Additionally, OSBP is part of a family of OSBPrelated proteins (ORPs) that have functions in lipid homeostasis at various cellular MCSs (see e. g., [71, 72] ). A recent study suggested a possible role for other ORPs, besides OSBP, in the replication of rhinoviruses [60] , but firm evidence for their involvement remains to be obtained.",

First, hepatitis A virus particles were found to be released enwrapped in host-derived membranes [13] . Second, CVB3 particles were also identified within vesicles [12] , and third, poliovirus was reported to be able to spread nonlytically [8] . A recent study reported that newly formed poliovirus virions are captured in autophagosome-like vesicular structures closely juxtaposed to ROs, and that both the ROs and the capsid-containing vesicular structures are enriched in the lipid phosphatidylserine [11] . Although it is unknown how exactly the virus-containing vesicular structures are formed, our ultrastructural analysis of CVB3-infected cells suggests that tubular ROs progressively transform into DMVs, which accumulate at later stages of infection [19] . After fusion of such DMVs with the plasma membrane, single-membrane, virus-containing extracellular vesicles would be released [11] . These resulting extracellular vesicles expose phosphatidylserine, a hallmark of apoptotic cells, which triggers uptake of the vesicles in neighboring cells. Transmission of virions in vesicles supports en bloc virus transmission and coinfection of cells by multiple virions [11] , butat least for the picornavirus hepatitis A virusdoes not abrogate the need for the virus receptor [13] . How phosphatidylserine becomes enriched in these membranes is unknown.",

Importantly, phosphatidylcholine produced during infection is distinct from that synthesized in uninfected cells, as there is a shift towards the generation of phosphatidylcholine with longer acyl chains (C16 and C18, i.e., fatty acyl chains with 16 and 18 carbon atoms, respectively) in infected cells, indicating that RO membranes are significantly different from the pre-existing cellular membranes.

To date, it has been poorly explored whether findings in cell culture reflect the in vivo situation. Different cell types can vary greatly in their protein and lipid composition, which may influence virus tropism and replication efficiency. Indeed, the machinery involved in virus entry differs considerably between polarized and nonpolarized cells (e.g., [84] ). However, several studies suggest that enterovirus-induced membrane rearrangements observed in polarized cells in vitro and in vivo [25, 85, 86] resembled those in nonpolarized cells [19, 20] , suggesting that the machinery involved in RO formation is largely conserved between different cell types. Consistently, studies using an inhibitor revealed that, of the host factors identified in cell culture, at least PI4KB is essential for enterovirus infection in vivo [36, 87] .",

Hence, findings in whichever experimental system may only represent part of the story in multicellular organisms with many different cell types. generation of physiological-like, PI4P-dependent MCSs. What the apparently universally important role of sterols at ROs is remains to be determined. Furthermore, physiological MCSs support the homeostasis of many lipids other than cholesterol, but it has not yet been investigated whether +RNA viruses also hijack MCS machinery to tune the RO lipid composition. Many aspects regarding biogenesis, composition, architecture, and function of ROs remain to be elucidated (see Outstanding Questions). We expect an important role for MCSs and viral hijacking of MCS machinery in infection to be uncovered in the near future. ",

Similar to cardioviruses, the distantly-related flavivirus hepatitis C virus exploits PI4KA to develop a PI4P-rich network of replication membranes, designated the membranous web[79]. Likewise, OSBP participates in hepatitis C virus infection by forming MCSs between the membranous web and the ER, and by shuttling cholesterol to the membranous web[63]. Unlike hepatitis C virus, the closely related flaviviruses dengue virus or West Nile virus do not require the PI4P-OSBP machinery of MCSs, although these viruses are sensitive to disruptions of cholesterol homeostasis and accumulate cholesterol at their ROs[63,[80][81][82].Tombusviruses, a family of plant viruses, were recently shown to also hijack MCS machinery and shuttle sterols to their ROs. The tombusvirus tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) generates invaginations in peroxisomes in which the viral genome is replicated. Studies in both plant cells and in yeast, which can be conveniently used as a surrogate host model system, have revealed that TBSV accumulates ergosterol (the main sterol in plants and yeast) at their ROs dependent on several homologs of OSBP and VAP",

How is the structure of ROs established; what is the role of lipids, and what is the contribution of cellular scaffolding/membrane-shaping proteins in determining RO structure and functionality? What is the lipid composition of ROs, and what are the roles of the individual components? Do picornaviruses exchange lipids other than PI4P and cholesterol via the ER-RO MCS? From where does the cholesterol that is funneled to ROs via MCSs originate? Do picornaviruses create MCSs with other organelles to exchange lipids?",
