            "text": "Sample MERS-CoV pneumonia case, study setting, and study population A 70-year-old woman henceforth known as patient A was admitted to hospital A complaining of back pain. At the time of admission, the patient had pneumonia with fever lasting 10 days. Two days later, patient A was transferred to intensive care unit where she received endotracheal intubation. Since a diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was not suspected during this period, HCWs did not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). As no specific pathogen was identified, testing for MERS-CoV infection was conducted. Real-time reverse transcriptaseepolymerase chain reaction (rRTePCR) was strongly positive for MERS-CoV [3] . Patient A had cycle threshold (C T ) values of 17.9 for envelope protein gene and 18.2 for open reading frame 1a gene. After patient A had been diagnosed with MERS-CoV, rapid contact tracing was performed and possible contact exposures were divided into two groups: high-risk and non-high-risk exposure groups. HCWs with highrisk exposure were isolated and immediately offered oral ribavirin (Viramid capsules; Ilsung Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, South Korea) and lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra; Abbvie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA). The PEP protocol was initiated between days 1 and 3 after the last unprotected exposure to patient A. PEP therapy was administered until day 14 after the last exposure according to the incubation period of the disease [1] . Ribavirin was administered orally at a loading dose of 2000 mg followed by 1200 mg every 8 h for 4 days and then 600 mg every 8 h for 6e8 days. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg/100 mg every 12 h for 11e13 days. Laboratory testing for HCWs in the PEP group was performed on days 3, 7, and 11 after treatment initiation. HCWs who received PEP therapy also underwent two-point sputum screening with MERS-CoV rRTePCR. To improve detection of unrecognized MERS-CoV infection in the PEP group, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Euroimmun, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) was also performed to detect MERS-CoV immunoglobulin G (IgG) after completion of PEP therapy [4] .",

Pre-isolation pneumonia patients visited participating hospitals without knowing that they were infected with MERS-CoV. C T data were available for all five MERS-CoV preisolation pneumonia patients.

We only included HCWs with high-risk exposure. HCWs from hospital A treated with PEP represented the PEP group. HCWs from other hospitals who did not receive PEP were classified as the non-PEP group. HCWs in the non-PEP group were isolated and monitored for the development of MERS-like symptoms for 14 days from the date of exposure to a patient with MERS.

The most common symptoms were diarrhoea (40.9%), nausea (40.9%), stomatitis (18.2%), and fever (13.6%). Twenty out of 22 HCWs in the PEP group underwent laboratory testing. Anaemia and leucopenia were observed in nine (45.0%) and eight (40.0%) HCWs, respectively, during PEP therapy. Hyperbilirubinaemia was observed in all 20 HCWs. However, other liver function tests were within normal ranges. Elevated total bilirubin and decreased values of haemoglobin and leucocyte were normalized after completion of PEP therapy.",

The main mode of MERS-CoV transmission is via respiratory droplets, indicating that HCWs are at particularly high risk for MERS-CoV infection [1] . Therefore, high-risk exposure during aerosol-generating procedures including tracheal intubation without appropriate PPE may increase the risk of MERS-CoV contamination. It was decided to administer prophylactic antiviral agents to HCWs with high-risk exposure to MERS patients, taking these various factors into consideration, although currently there is no recommendation for MERS-CoV PEP. Our PEP regimen was based on available literature and evidence obtained from animal and patient studies [7e10]. In the absence of current guidelines for PEP therapy, PEP agents were administered until the 14th day after the last exposure based on incubation period of the disease.",
