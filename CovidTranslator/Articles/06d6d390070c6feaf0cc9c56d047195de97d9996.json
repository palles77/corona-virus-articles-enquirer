There are two general approaches, both of which comprise several variants. One commonly used general approach is to utilize the 16S rRNA gene, and the other is a more complex metagenomic approach in which community DNA is subject to shotgun (whole genome) sequencing.

Additional ''omic'' disciplines are, thus, being applied to augment studies of the microbiome.

From these studies we now know that cultivation-resistant anaerobes belonging to the family Fusobacteriaceae (particularly Sneathia sanguinegens, and Leptotrichia spp.) are also commonly found in amniotic fluid. Other diverse microbes detected by PCR of amniotic fluid include as yet uncultivated and uncharacterized species. A causal relationship between diverse microbes, as detected by PCR, and preterm birth is supported by types of association (e.g., space, time, and dose) proposed as alternatives to Koch's postulates for inferring causality from molecular findings. Whether this colonization affects the gastrointestinal tract of the fetus is not known. We do know, however, that the fetus is known to swallow large quantities of amniotic fluid during the last trimester of pregnancy, and there have been recent findings that microbial DNA is present in meconium. These both suggest that the fetal intestine is exposed to the amniotic fluid microbes. The high sensitivity of the fetal intestine to inflammatory mediators such as LPS [13, 14] suggests that microbes may trigger intestinal inflammation in utero. Furthermore, one can speculate that exposure of the intestinal tract to toll like receptor agonists such as LPS, flagellin or microbial CpG in low quantities may also ''tolerize'' the intestine to further inflammatory stimuli [15 \u2022 ].",

Available epidemiological data show that atopic diseases, asthma, type 1 diabetes and food allergies appear more often in infants after cesarean delivery than after vaginal delivery [27] [28] [29] [30] . Studies in adults using nonculture-based analysis of the intestinal microbiota show that antibiotics may perturb the gastrointestinal tract for years. [31] Since many mothers delivered by C-section also receive antibiotics, whether they have a role in perturbing the newborn intestinal microecology remains unknown but is a confounding factor when one evaluates the epidemiology studies showing atopic disease, type 1 diabetes and food allergies in C-section versus vaginally delivered infants. The composition of enteric microbiota in the early days of life may be a very important factor for achieving and maintaining good health in the years to come. It follows that it is fundamental to identify more thoroughly the intestinal ecosystem during the early developmental stages of life.",

Beneficial factors of breast milk include immunoglobulins, cytokines, lactoferrin, lysozyme, growth factors, and oligosaccharides (HMO) [17, 34] . Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) contain a lactose core and act as prebiotics, stimulating growth of Bifidobacterium species [35, 36] . At birth a rapid colonization of intestinal flora occurs in the newborn, with aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria such as enterobacteria, enterococci and staphylococci represented. These consume oxygen during growth, allowing the proliferation of anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides, Bifidobacterias and Clostridia [37, 38] . In the formula-fed infant this transition does not occur, and the newborn intestinal flora differs in its pattern of colonization, with a predominance of Gram negative bacteria and fewer anaerobes [39, 40] . If grouped by phyla, breast-fed infants have a predominance of 'healthy' Firmicutes, mainly Lactobacillus, Bacteroides and Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium). Formula-fed infants have a predominance of Proteobacteria such as Escherichia coli, and Firmicutes, some of which have pathogenic characteristics such as Clostridia and Staphylococcus. In one study of preterm infants it was speculated that the abnormal pattern of colonization at birth coupled with a delayed bloom of more pathogenic bacteria could potentially lead to the development of NEC [41] . Sullivan et al. [32] in one multicenter study utilizing donor human milk showed that an exclusively human milk-based diet (including human milk based fortifier) is associated with significantly lower rates of NEC, including surgical NEC, when compared with a mother's milk-based diet that also includes bovine milk-based products. The reduction in NEC utilizing strategies of only human milk was 50 % for medical NEC and almost 90 % for surgical NEC.",

Often, their use is justified, but other times it's the product of fear of infections on the part of the care providers. Nevertheless, the use of antibiotics in neonates and especially in the preterm infant has unintended and sometimes adverse consequences. Antibiotic exposure may reduce the diversity of intestinal microbiota, delay the colonization of beneficial bacteria and potentially predispose preterm neonates to NEC. One recent retrospective study found that the duration of antibiotic exposure is associated with an increased risk of NEC among neonates without prior sepsis [43 \u2022 ]. Indeed, studies have shown that overgrowth of pathogenic species is increased after three days of antimicrobial exposure [44] . In the U.S. most mothers giving birth prematurely are treated with antibiotics and most very low birth weight infants are treated with a course of broad spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin and gentamicin. Studies have shown the detrimental effects of antibiotics to the intestinal flora, even after one dose of antibiotics with alterations in the intestinal microbiota that could take years to recover [18] . One study showed a decrease in diversity, a predominance of less desirable bacteria and highly resistant clones with abundance of specific resistance genes as a result of antibiotic exposure that did not recover after two years post exposure [45] . Cotten et al. [46] found that each empirical treatment day with antibiotic was associated with increased odds of death, necrotizing enterocolitis, and the composite measure of necrotizing enterocolitis or death. They concluded that prolonged initial empirical antibiotic therapy may be associated with increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis or death and should be used with caution.",

With the advent of neonatal intensive care, it has become one of the most common and devastating diseases in neonates [47] [48] [49] . Complicating the literature is the fact that the causes are multifactorial, and it is not a single disease [48] . For example, when an infant born at term with a hypoplastic left ventricle presents with pneumatosis intestinalis at two days of age, the etiology and pathophysiology of this baby's ''NEC'' is likely different than the 25 week gestation preterm who presents with pneumatosis intestinalis at fiveweeks of age. The first is more likely related to ischemic injury due to hemodynamic insufficiency and hypoxicischemic injury [50] rather than a coalescence of factors that result in intestinal inflammation and injury related to intestinal immaturity, as in the preterm infant. In the latter case, sometimes referred to as ''classic'' NEC [48] , the interactions of a predisposing genetic background, an immature intestinal barrier and a microbial environment that is conducive to the development of NEC are thought to play an interactive and critical role in pathogenesis [48, 49, 51] .",

[57] , fecal samples from 20 preterm infants, ten with NEC and ten matched controls (including four twin pairs), were obtained from patients in a single site level III neonatal intensive care unit. Bacterial DNA was subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and library sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The distribution of samples from NEC patients was distinctly different from that of controls, though intestinal bacterial colonization in all of these preterm infants was notable for low diversity. Patients with NEC had previously received a higher mean number of days of antibiotics and had even less diversity with an increase in abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and a decrease in other bacteria species. These results suggest a relationship with prior use of antibiotics in patients with NEC, though in this study infants may have been on antibiotics with NEC when the cultures were collected.",

High throughput 16S rRNA sequencing was used to compare the diversity of microbiota and the prevalence of specific bacterial signatures in nine NEC infants and in nine matched controls. A bloom (34 % increase) of Proteobacteria and a decrease (32 %) in Firmicutes in NEC cases between the 1 week and\\72 h was detected. No significant change was identified in the controls. Several molecular signatures were increased in the NEC cases one week before and within 72 h of NEC development. One of the bacterial signatures detected more frequently in NEC cases (p \\ 0.01) matched closest to c-Proteobacteria, also noted in the Wang study [57] . Although this sequence grouped with the well studied Enterobacteriaceae family, it did not match any sequence in Genbank by more than 97 %, suggesting that novel pathogens contribute to the etiology of NEC.",
