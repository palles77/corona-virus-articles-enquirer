            "text": "The spread of infectious diseases, rumors, fashions, and innovations are complex contagion processes, embedded in network and spatial contexts. While the studies in the former context are intensively expanded, the latter remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the pattern formation of an interacting contagion, where two infections, A and B, interact with each other and diffuse simultaneously in space. The contagion process for each follows the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible kinetics, and their interaction introduces a potential change in the secondary infection propensity compared to the baseline reproduction number R 0 . We show that the nontrivial spatial infection patterns arise when the susceptible individuals move faster than the infected and the interaction between the two infections is neither too competitive nor too cooperative. Interestingly, the system exhibits pattern hysteresis phenomena, i.e., quite different parameter regions for patterns exist in the direction of increasing or decreasing R 0 . Decreasing R 0 reveals remarkable enhancement in contagion prevalence, meaning that the eradication becomes difficult compared to the single-infection or coinfection without space. Linearization analysis supports our observations, and we have identified the required elements and dynamical mechanism, which suggests that these patterns are essentially Turing patterns. Our work thus reveals new complexities in interacting contagions and paves the way for further investigation because of its relevance to both biological and social contexts.",

Well-known examples include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003 [1, 2] , influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 [3] , Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in 2012 [4] , Ebola in 2013 [5] , and the continuing H7N9 of avian influenza virus [6] , etc. To understand contagion processes, mathematical models are an essential tool and have a long tradition in scientific communities that can date back to Bernuolli's work on the smallpox vaccination in 1760 [7] . Until now, the modeling effort has been fruitful at all levels [8, 9] , ranging from conceptual models [10, 11] that capture the generic features of contagions, network models [12] [13] [14] [15] that focus on the underlying structure of population or commuting patterns to the sophisticated computational models [16, 17] , where a variety of high-resolution data, like demographics, transportation, epidemiological features, and behavioral response [18] , are incorporated.",

            "text": "One important research line aims to understand realistic yet more complicated contagion scenarios, where, e.g., more than one infection is considered that circulates simultaneously in the population. This sort of interacting contagions is motivated by the fact that the spread of different infections in the real world is not entirely independent; they often influence each other [19, 20] . Well-known examples include the case * chenl@snnu.edu.cn of pneumonia bacterium like Streptococcus pneumoniae and viral respiratory illness (e.g., seasonal influenza) where they mutually facilitate each other's propogation [21, 22] , and the coinfection between human immunodeficiency virus and a host of other infections [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . The interaction among different infections can be either competitive [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] (they suppress each other's circulation) or cooperative [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] (they support each other). The mean-field treatment and percolation studies of structured population reveal a rich spectrum of new dynamical features that are unexpected in the classic scenario of single infection. For example, when different infections are competing, both one-infection-dominance and coexistence are possible, depending on the properties of involved infections and the underlining networks [28] . By contrast, in cooperative contagions discontinuous outbreak transition appears [35, 36] , along with many interesting spreading features such as the higher chance of outbreak in clustered networks [37] , firstorder phase transitions in the contagion prevalence [40] , etc.",

The investigation of the spatial role is indispensable for a full comprehension of contagion complexities [44, 45] , not only for its conceptual significance but also for its practical relevance to the real world [46] . Abundant empirical evidence reveals nontrivial dynamical properties in spatial epidemiology, such as traveling waves [47] , infection patterns [48] , and even the spatiotemporal chaos [49] . A major modeling effort is devoted to the studies of traveling waves in spatial domains, like the Black Death in Europe or the rabies epizootic in France [44] . The emergence of infec- In the contagion process, S becomes partially infected (A/B) with an initial infection rate \u03b1 by contacting the infected; the partially infected individuals can be further be infected by the other infection to be doubly infected (AB) with the secondary infection rate \u03b1 . All infected individuals recover with rate \u03b2. (b) Spatially interacting contagions: When subpopulations are coupled through their spatial neighborhood, the diffusion captures the local mobility of individuals and thus also the infections they carried. Generally, the mobility of a given individual depends on its state; e.g., in epidemic spread, susceptible people statistically move faster than infected individuals, who might prefer to stay at home or in the hospital for recovery. Mathematically, this is captured by D S > D A,B,AB within the RD framework described by Eq. (2). tion patterns, however, receives much less attention, yet a few mechanisms are proposed for their generation [50, 51] . These studies mainly focus on the single infection cases by incorporating additional compartments and/or additional dynamical processes. To our knowledge, there is rare work discussing the spatial dynamics of interacting contagions, especially the possibility of pattern emergence. A preliminary effort studies the spatial dynamics of two interacting contagions, assuming all individuals are of identical mobilities; novel propagation modes are revealed, like receding fronts and standing waves [40] . However, in realistic cases, individuals in different states are generally of different mobilities, depending on the individual's state. For example, healthy people normally move faster than the sick, who might prefer staying at home or in the hospital for recovery. So what is the generic spatial dynamics when more than one infection proliferates in the population? This question is also of particular interest in the ecology community, where different diffusivities of species are thought to be responsible for the emergence of patchiness [52] . In addition, recent works show that multiplex networks as the underlying medium provide another mechanism for generating patterns even if all species are of the same mobility [53] [54] [55] [56] .",

The simplest case, where D S = D A = D B = D AB , has been studied in Ref. [40] and mainly focuses on the properties of traveling waves. There, apart from the classic scenario of forward movements, the backward propagation also emerges, together with the possibility of standing waves being expected. These new modes come from the competition between the reactions and the diffusion in Eq. (2). In the following studies, we consider a more general setting, where the individuals' mobilities depend on their states; therefore the diffusion coefficients are not all identical any more. To simplify, we only differ the diffusion of the infected from the susceptible's and do not further distinguish those partially infected and the doubly infected, i.e., D A = D B = D AB = D I = D S . As mentioned above, the mobilities of the infected individuals are generally lower than the healthy, and therefore we assume D S > D I = 1 if not stated otherwise.

We might suppose that it is due to the contagion interaction that induces pattern formation. Strong cooperation or competition may be preferred. But this is not actually the case. Figure 3 shows that too-competitive (small C) or toocooperative (large C) interaction hinders the emergence of a pattern (e.g., C = 0.2 and C = 3). More evidence is illustrated in the evolution of h(t ) for a couple of cases with different C [Figs. 3(d) and 3(e)]. As we see, the increasing trend of h(t ) becomes slower or just ceases when the interaction C deviates gradually from 1 at both sides. These suggest that the most favored case for pattern emergence occurs at an intermediate interaction (here, coincidentally, the neutral scenario). The maximal eigenvalues \u03bb max clearly show that only a bounded range of C supports the emergence of patterns, and they peak around C = 1 [ Fig. 3(f) ]. While the positive sign of \u03bb max indicates the possibility of pattern formation, their absolute value determines the speed of segregation process. So for those with small positive eigenvalues, pattern formation takes a long time, like the one in Fig. 3(b) . Note that the specific value of C for the most favored cases is not necessarily at 1; generally, it depends on the reproduction number R 0 , a larger R 0 reduces the value, and vice versa. Further studies show that when C deviates from the most favored case, the peaked mode k becomes smaller; accordingly, the pattern scale increases [according to Eq. (7)], as one can compare the number of bars in Fig. 3(b) and in Fig. 2 .",

A more confusing observation is that the intermediate interaction cases like the neutral one are the most likely scenario for patterns. These cases are usually believed to be weakly or noninteracting; the dynamics of the two infections are almost decoupled just as the single infection case, and no any pattern should be expected. This argument is, however, not true because the two contagion processes are not completely decoupled even when C = 1, as we will discuss later.",

There is an upper threshold in R 0 for pattern transitions in all cases, above which the prevalence \u03c1 A,B is homogeneous. This means that, similarly to contagion interaction C, a bounded range is present for patterns. This range expands as D S becomes larger, but the upper threshold reduces as C increases. Figure 4 (c) summarizes these observations in a more compact way. Notice that whenever the pattern becomes less likely to emerge (approaching the boundaries), the pattern scale increases. A close observation shows that for weakly cooper-ative or competitive cases (C < 2) where outbreak phase transitions are continuous in the MF treatment, patterns are not allowed for R 0 < 1; this result is incorrect because the eigenvalues are computed based on the equilibrium of MF treatment (see Appendix), which could be different when patterns are present.

It shows that patterns tend to disappear when C deviates from the intermediate values or D S becomes smaller. The former observation is consistent with the above results whereby the most favored cases for patterns occur at intermediate interactions. The latter observation suggests that a higher mobility of the susceptible is beneficial to the pattern emergence. In principle, a large-enough D S can always produce patterns no matter how strong the interaction between the two infections (either large or small C). Figure 5 (b) shows the impact of the infected mobilities, where we can see that increasing D I shrinks the pattern regions. This means for those cases where the infected individuals still move a lot, a pattern is less likely to appear. Actually, what really matters here is the ratio of the two diffusion coefficients; these boundaries are all well collapsed by rescaling the x axis as D S /D I if C is not too large (see Supplementary Figure S1 ) [59] . This is because their absolute values simply set scale, and it is the ratio of D S /D I that shifts the peaked wave-vector mode k, namely the pattern scales. Notice that for the limiting case of D I = 0, where the infections become completely localized, the spreading is blocked and there is no nontrivial patterns expected. All together, pattern formation favors the condition when the susceptible people diffuse a lot and at the same time the infected move relatively less (i.e., large ratio D S /D I ), which prevents a too-large pattern scale from exceeding the domain size.

In numerical simulations, we start from the equilibrium state under the initial R 0 , the increasing (decreasing) rate of R 0 is set 10 \u22127 per time unit, and random perturbations within (0, ) are constantly imposed to trigger patterns or outbreaks in the density of I AB (x, t ) for each site per time unit; accordingly, S(x, t ) minus the same for the density conservation.

By decreasing the reproduction number, pattern emerges until R 0 \u2248 1.08, predicted by the eigenvalue analysis. An amazing phenomenon happens when we further decrease R 0 so the eradication of the two infections now occurs not at R e 0 but at a much smaller threshold, R e,p 0 (\"p\" indicates the presence of patterns). This means that a persistent prevalence is present compared to the MF case (without space) in this less-infectious region. An intuitive explanation can be found in Fig. 6(d) , where the coinfected individuals are now clustered in a few spatial spots in quite high densities; the two infections support each other, making their survival at a rather small R 0 . Here the number of segregated bars decreases in both cases as time goes by [ Fig. 6 (b) and 6(d)], indicating that the pattern scale increases as the patterns become less likely, in line with the above observations. Taken together, by varying R 0 in two directions, the pattern regions are quite different, only sharing a small overlap. This process is reminiscent of hysteresis in statistical physics, and hence we term the phenomenon pattern hysteresis. In the standard hysteresis, like first-order phase transitions, the critical behavior is depicted by a different transition point along each direction, and the hysteresis is defined typically by two different thresholds. In pattern hysteresis, however, the critical behavior along each direction is defined by a set of two thresholds for a pattern region, and the hysteresis is defined by two different sets of thresholds.

Strikingly, the higher prevalence than MF value in these noncooperative cases are observed for all patterned regions, not only the patterned range within R 0 < 1 as shown in Fig. 6(c) .

While the former is naturally driven by the diffusion difference, the latter is critical for further growth and is summarized in Fig. 7(c) . There the reactions happen within each local site for aggregation, and diffusion occurs between neighboring sites for dilution. Once an alternating profile is triggered between neighboring sites, the reaction dominates over the diffusion at the beginning for the growth of the profiles.

So the activator and inhibitor are not fixed but spatially alternating, region L/H dependent. Even so, we argue that the patterns here still belong to Turing mechanism, because they are consistent with the general criterion \"local activation with lateral inhibition\" [61, 62] . Wherever a dynamical loop emerges, the aggregation process increases the local activator and then is followed by the inhibition by others in its lateral regions.

Their emergence does not require any peculiar infection-infection interaction; instead, the pattern formation favors a mild condition where too-strong cooperation or competition is absent. Dynamical mechanism analysis reveals an aggregation phenomenon along with a dynamical loop. This mechanism is rooted in the intrinsic dynamics when two infections are engaged, and too-strong baseline infection or infection-infection interaction destroys this loop. Among other observations, one finding of particular interest is the pattern hysteresis, i.e., the pattern formation is not only determined by the system parameters but also depends on its evolution history.

Figure 3 (f) shows such an example to examine the role of contagion interaction C in pattern formation. Similar computations are conducted for Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). A bit more complicated case is Fig. 5(a) , where the eigenvalue \u03bb max is now a function of both C and D S , and the value of \u03bb max is color coded. Since the system is conserved when the mode k \u2192 0 as described by Eq. (1), we can easily prove that \u03bb max = 0 rather than negative values for those cases without pattern. To divide the region in Fig. 5(a) , it is therefore proper to set a threshold with a small value, say, 10 \u22125 , to separate the pattern formation region (\u03bb max > 10 \u22125 ) from the region without pattern (\u03bb max < 10 \u22125 ). The location of the boundary could shift slightly when using a different threshold, and this shift is undetectable as long as the threshold value is small enough. In Fig. 5(b) , we only plot the boundary lines for different mobilities of infected D I , and with these curves, we can study the impact of D I on the region available for pattern. Figure 4 (c) is obtained in a similar way as in Fig. 5(b) : by plotting the boundaries in the R 0 -C parameter space for a couple of D S .",
