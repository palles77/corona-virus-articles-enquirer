He had worked with influenza during graduate school, studying viral proteins that help the pathogen to survive and replicate inside human cells. He became fascinated by how the virus hijacks its host cells, but found little support within his basic virology department to pursue this biological interaction. \"People in virology in the old days didn't care too much about the host cell's role,\" he says. So, he shifted his research focus and took a postdoc position at the Institute for Medical Radiation and Cell Research at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany, where he could search for the molecular changes that cause normal lung and skin cells to become cancerous.",

In 1998, just a year after transitioning from a postdoc to head of his own research team at the Institute for Medical Radiation and Cell Research, Ludwig followed a hunch, and fished out some influenza virus samples from the back of the freezer in his lab. He then exposed some human lung and kidney epithelial cells growing in dishes in the incubator to the flu virus he'd just defrosted. The next step was the clincher: Ludwig treated the cells with a drug that blocks a major component of a pathway that flu-infected cells and cancer cells have in common, called the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The protein that he wanted to block, called MEK (MAPK/Erk kinase), is best known for its role in propagating growth and survival signals that come from outside of the cell, including those that come from overactive receptors found on many tumor cells. To his satisfaction, the drug-which Pfizer, based in New York, was developing as a chemotherapy agent for breast, colon, pancreatic, and lung cancers-reduced the virus's ability to replicate inside cells.",

Ludwig felt that Pleschka would make a good collaborator because, besides his season, acquired a mutation, called H275Y, that made viral isolates at least partially, if not totally, resistant to oseltamivir; by the beginning of the following flu season, some countries were reporting that the drug was useless against nearly 100% of samples tested 3, 4 . Although the strain of influenza currently circulating worldwide, H3N2, is susceptible to oseltamivir and other neuraminidase inhibitors, \"resistance in some of the common strains is something that may happen again,\" Garcia-Sastre says.",

Pfizer's MEK inhibitor had already passed phase 1 safety trials as a candidate cancer treatment before research into it was discontinued. And chemotherapy drugs, such as the MEK inhibitor, would be even safer as influenza treatments, Planz says, because it would take much lower doses and shorter treatment times to interfere with influenza's activation of normal proteins than those needed to block mutant proteins in cancer. Atriva derived its own formulation of the compound, called ATR001, to increase cellular uptake of the drug. The company plans to test ATR001 in a phase 1b study in the next year and a half. And Planz says 2005, where his group now studies therapies that, similarly to the MEK inhibitor, fight viruses by altering proteins in the cells that the viruses infect. In 2015, along with Pleschka and immunologist Oliver Planz of the University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany, Ludwig cofounded Atriva Therapeutics to develop anti-flu derivatives of the original MEK-inhibiting compound, which Pfizer had dropped as a cancer-therapy candidate after a phase 2 trial failed to meet its primary endpoint. \"When we started this in 2001, we had serious opponents,\" says Pleschka. \"People said, 'If you want to inhibit the virus, you have to inhibit the virus-not the host.'\" Now, the influenza field is changing, and Atriva's candidate is just one of many approaches to fight flu with drugs that target human cells.",

Treating influenza with compounds that work on components of human cells, rather than on viral particles-an approach often called host-directed therapy-is gaining traction in virology. Scientists are enthusiastic about this approach primarily because drug targets in host cells do not rapidly mutate, as viral genes do. Influenza's ability to develop resistance to drugs has left just one class of drugs available to fight the virus. \"For flu right now, there is only one specific family of inhibitors approved for the treatment of severe influenza, which are the neuraminidase inhibitors,\" says Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, a microbiologist at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City and project leader for FluOMICS, a group of US researchers who are using systems biology to study the interactions between influenza virus and host-cell proteins.",

The virus, he says, borrows cellular tools to enter the cell, release its RNA genome into the cell's cytoplasm, and transport that genome into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, the influenza genome is replicated and wound up into complexes called ribonucleoproteins. Ribonucleoproteins then need to make the trip back out of the nucleus to become the cargo of new viral particles that bud off from the cell and infect neighboring cells. Using influenza samples supplied by Pleschka, Ludwig's team infected cells and, after treating half of them with the MEK inhibitor, tagged the cells with fluorescent antibodies that would reveal the virus's location. The MEK inhibitor, as it turned out, interrupted the ribonucleoproteins' outbound trip from the nucleus. The group reported in 2001 that, in the presence of the inhibitor, all new viral genomes were trapped in the nucleus, and as a result, the infection could no longer spread from cell to cell 1 . Ludwig, who calls this result his \"wow observation,\" says that it convinced him that they were really on to something. \"This really showed that there was a specific effect,\" he says.",

The German drug company Ventaleon licensed the idea, which the three had already patented, and, in partnership with the UK-based pharmaceutical company Vectura, Ventaleon conducted the phase 2 trial of hospitalized patients with severe influenza. The results of the trial, which ended in May 2015, have not been published, but Planz presented the data at last year's international influenza meeting in M\u00fcnster. The findings showed that oseltamivir, when administered in combination with the NF-\u03baB inhibitor and taken three times a day, alleviated flu symptoms more rapidly than treatment with oseltamivir alone. The drug is inhaled, and so its effect is local and transient, which makes it a safe way to inhibit NF-\u03baB.",

As the recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses have demonstrated, highly specific antivirals cannot always be developed quickly enough to be put to use in the event of an outbreak. As a result, \"if a new virus comes along, we don't have any ability to treat it whatsoever. You have to effectively come up with a brand-new treatment, \" Reddy says. Host-directed approaches that focus on cell functions or pathways commonly hijacked by many viruses would supply immediate targets.",
