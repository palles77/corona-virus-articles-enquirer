Using the human decay-accelerating factor (DAF; CD55), a known glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid-anchored protein, chimeric constructs were made to substitute the GPI-anchor domain of DAF with the putative lipid-anchor domain of GP4, and their membrane association and lipase cleavage were determined in cells. The DAF-GP4 fusion protein was transported to the plasma membrane and was cleaved by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), indicating that the C-terminal domain of GP4 functions as a GPI anchor. Mutational studies for residues adjacent to the GPI modification site and characterization of respective mutant viruses generated from infectious cDNA clones show that the ability of GP4 for membrane association corresponded to virus viability and growth characteristics. The residues T158 (\u03c9 \u2212 2, where \u03c9 is the GPI moiety at E160), P159 (\u03c9 \u2212 1), and M162 (\u03c9 + 2) of GP4 were determined to be important for virus replication, with M162 being of particular importance for virus infectivity. The complete removal of the peptide-anchor domain in GP4 resulted in a complete loss of virus infectivity. The depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane of cells reduced the virus production, suggesting a role of lipid rafts in PRRSV infection. Remarkably, GP4 was found to colocalize with CD163 in the lipid rafts on the plasma membrane. Since CD163 has been reported as a cellular receptor for PRRSV and GP4 has been shown to interact with this receptor, our data implicates an important role of lipid rafts during entry of the virus.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a recently emerged viral disease and causes significant economic losses to the swine industry today. The etiological agent is the PRRS virus (PRRSV), which is a member of the family Arteriviridae (Meulenberg et al., 1993 (Meulenberg et al., , 1994 Wensvoort et al., 1991; Nelson et al., 1993) that includes other viruses such as equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenaseelevating virus of mice (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). The family Arteriviridae together with the families Coronaviridae and Roniviridae form the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997; Cowley et al., 2000; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003; Smits et al., 2003) . PRRSV contains a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 15 kb that encodes two large non-structural polyproteins (PP1a and PP1a/1b) in the 5\u2032-terminal 12 kb region and 8 structural proteins in the 3\u2032-terminal 3 kb region: GP2 (glycoprotein 2), E (small envelope), GP3, GP4, GP5, ORF5a, M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins in order (Firth et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2011; Meulenberg et al., 1993; Nelsen et al., 1999; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; Snijder et al., 1999; Wootton et al., 2000) . While N protein associates with the genomic RNA and makes up the viral capsid, the other proteins are membrane-associated. Of these, GP5 and M form a disulfide-linked heterodimer (Mardassi et al., 1996) that is essential for virus infectivity (Faaberg et al., 1995; Snijder et al., 2003) . The E protein is a myristoylated protein and likely functions as an ion-channel protein embedded in the viral envelope facilitating the uncoating of virus and release of the genome into the cytoplasm (Lee and Yoo, 2006) . GP2, GP3, and GP4 are minor glycoproteins and form a disulfide-linked heterotrimer essential for viral infectivity (Wieringa et al., 2003a (Wieringa et al., , 2003b . Co-expression of E, GP2, GP3, and GP4 results in the transport of these proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the Golgi, suggesting an important role of the hetero-multimerization for virus assembly and maturation (Wissink et al., 2005) . ORF5a is a newly identified membrane protein encoded in the internal ORF within ORF5 with an unknown function (Firth et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2011) .",

Genes encoding GPI-anchored proteins specify two signal sequences in the primary translation product: an N-terminal signal sequence for ER targeting and a C-terminal hydrophobic sequence that directs its association to the membrane via the lipid (Orlean and Menon, 2007) . The process for GPI biosynthesis takes place in the ER (Takeda and Kinoshita, 1995) , and the proteins subjected to GPI-modification enter the ER lumen via the N-terminal ER targeting signal which is cleaved off by a signal peptidase in the lumen (Gerber et al., 1992) . In addition to the N-terminal signal sequence, GPI-anchored proteins contain a C-terminal hydrophobic sequence that directs the cleavage of the signal sequence from the protein and the replacement with a preformed GPIanchor by action of the transamidase complex (Ikezawa, 2002) . The GPI-linked proteins are then targeted to the membranes. The structural feature of PRRSV GP4 resembles that of a GPI-anchored protein.",

GPI modification serves a variety of functions including directing proteins to the cell surface (Lisanti et al., 1988) , association with lipid rafts (Taylor and Hooper, 2006) , lymphocytes activation (Robinson et al., 1989) , and signal transduction (Cary and Cooper, 2000; Jacobs et al., 2000) . The GPI anchor in particular has the propensity to target proteins to lipid rafts (Brown and London, 1998; Metzner et al., 2008) . Lipid rafts are dynamic assemblies of the lipid-ordered phase of microdomains that are highly enriched with cholesterol and sphingolipids in the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane (Ikonen, 2001; Simons and Toomre, 2000) . Lipid rafts compartmentalize cellular processes by serving as organizing centers for assembly of signaling molecules, influencing membrane fluidity and protein trafficking, endocytosis, transcytosis as well as for hostpathogen interactions (Ikonen, 2001; Pike, 2009; Simons and Toomre, 2000; van der Goot and Harder, 2001) . For viruses, lipid rafts play an important role in viral entry (Ewers and Helenius, 2011); Norkin, 1999; Parton and Lindsay, 1999; Vieira et al., 2010 , assembly (Mani\u00e9 et al., 2000 Ono and Freed, 2001) and budding (Chazal and Gerlier, 2003; Scheiffele et al., 1999) . Some viral membrane-associated and also envelope proteins such as the Gag protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (Ono and Freed, 2001) , the hemagglutinin of influenza virus (Takeda et al., 2003) , the tegument protein of herpes simplex virus (Lee et al., 2003) , the NS1 protein of dengue virus (Noisakran et al., 2008) , and the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Lu et al., 2008) associate with the lipid rafts. The involvement of lipid rafts in PRRSV infection has not been examined.",

The N-terminal hydrophobic domain likely functions as the signal peptide to direct the protein to ER membrane and the C-terminal hydrophobic domain to anchor the protein to membrane, but unlike the common structure seen in type I membrane glycoproteins, GP4 does not possess a hydrophilic cytoplasmic tail following the hydrophobic anchor domain at the C-terminus (Fig. 1) . The cytoplasmic tail generally protrudes into the lumen when the protein is associated with the ER membrane, and the unusual feature of GP4 resembles the topology of GPI-anchored protein, for example, DAF which is a well-characterized GPI-anchored protein (Nickells et al., 1994) . When GP4 sequences were analyzed using the GPI prediction program (http://gpi.unibe.ch; Fankhauser and M\u00e4ser, 2005) , a GPI anchor signal was readily detectable. When a large number of GP4 sequences were examined including the European and North American genotypes, the European-like PRRSV circulating in the USA, and the highly virulent PRRSV emerged in China (Fig. 1A) , the GPI anchor signal became more prominent and appeared to be highly conserved across the genotypes including LDV and EAV. Thus, we hypothesized that the PRRSV GP4 protein might be modified by GPI attachment and anchored with the membrane through the GPI.",

When HeLa cells were transfected with the pEGFP-GP4 plasmid, the GP4-EGFP fusion protein of about 56 kDa was expressed ( Fig. 2A, lane 4) . In addition, a minor band of 30 kDa which was slightly larger than EGFP alone was identified (Fig. 2A, lane 4, \u0394GP4) , suggesting that the C-terminal portion of GP4 might have been cleaved and the cleaved portion which was fused with EGFP was detectable by EGFP antibody. Such band was absent in cells transfected with pEGFP-N which is a fusion construct of the PRRSV N protein with EGFP ( Fig. 2A, lane 5) . This result suggests that GP4 is possibly a GPI-anchored protein and not all but some of the GP4 molecules are modified by GPI attachment.",

HeLa cells naturally express human DAF as a 41 kDa protein before GPImodification (Karnauchow et al., 1996) and after glycosylation and GPI-modification, it becomes approximately 82-88 kDa (Nickells et al., 1994) , which can readily be detectable by DAF MAb from cell lysates (Fig. 2B, lane 4) . To facilitate the detection of GP4 while maintaining its structural integrity as much as possible, the Flag sequence tag of 'YKDDDDK' was inserted between positions D87 and E88 of GP4, and pXJ41-FLAG-GP4 was constructed (Fig. 1C) . HeLa cells transfected with pXJ41-FLAG-GP4 produced the GP4 protein of approximately 29 kDa (Fig. 2B , lane 3, lower arrow). This form of GP4 was predominant among two other forms of GP4 produced in these cells. GP4 is an integral membrane protein with multiple glycans added onto it (Meulenberg et al., 1995; Wissink et al., 2005) , and the 29 kDa protein and two additional bands of smaller sizes likely represent the fully mature and the partially glycosylated forms of GP4 as previously observed (Das et al., 2010) . A 50 kDa band was identified (Fig. 2B, lane 3, upper arrow) , and this is likely the fully modified GPI-anchored form of GP4.",

For this experiment, HEK-293 cells were transfected with pXJ41-FLAG-GP4 and at 24 hpt, trypsinized and digested with PI-PLC in suspension. The supernatants were then analyzed by western blot using anti-FLAG Ab. In parallel, PI-PLC-digested cells were subjected to FACS analysis after staining with anti-FLAG Ab. Unexpectedly, no protein band equivalent to digested GP4 was observed from the supernatants, and the intensity of fluorescence was not diminished in PI-PLC-digested cells as compared to the untreated cells (data not shown). Total lysates of PI-PLC-digested cells and untreated cells were also examined by western blot, but no difference was found in their migration patterns. The 50 kDa band did not change its migration after PI-PLC digestion (data not shown), and we concluded that the GPI modification of GP4 was resistant to PI-PLC digestion.",

The PRRSV GP4 protein may exist as the GPI-modified form and the GPIunmodified hydrophobic peptide-anchored form, which may have caused the inability of PI-PLC digestion. Thus to further determine if GP4 was a GPI-modified protein, two chimeric constructs were made such that the known GPI-anchor domain of human DAF was substituted with the putative GPI-modification domain of GP4 protein (Figs. 3A, B) and the C-terminal hydrophobic region of GP2 protein of PRRSV (Fig. 3C ). The residue cross-linked to the lipid moiety is termed \u03c9 site, and upstream residues are designated \u03c9-minus while downstream residues are designated \u03c9-plus with respect to their positions from the \u03c9 site (Ikezawa, 2002) . The \u03c9 site of human DAF is serine at position 353 (S353) (Nickells et al., 1994; Fig. 3A) , which is identical to the computer prediction (GPI modification prediction; http:// mendel.imp.ac.at/gpi/gpi_server.html). By using the same program, the potential \u03c9 site for GP4 was predicted to be at E160, and based protein of PRRSV PA8. GP4 contains two hydrophobic domains (HD), one at the N-terminus and the other at the C-terminus. GP4 was cloned to express as a fusion protein with EGFP using a linker of five glycine (5G) residues. '\u03c9' at position 160 (E160) indicates the putative GPI modification site, and the arrow between positions 160 and 161 indicates the potential cleavage site specific for PI-PLC lipase. Numbers indicate amino acid positions. (C) The Flag-tag sequence of YKDDDDKGS was inserted between positions D87 and E88 (nucleotide sequence positions 261 and 262) of GP4 gene cloned in pXJ41, and pXJ41-Flag-GP4 was constructed. on this prediction the region of 144-178 of GP4 was chosen to replace with the 349-381 fragment of human DAF to construct pXJ41-DAF/4 (Fig. 3B ). The PRRSV GP2 protein was chosen to serve as a GPInegative control and the 204-256 fragment of GP2 was used to replace the 349-381 region of DAF. This construct was designated pXJ41-DAF/ 2 (Fig. 3C ).",

For GP4, the \u03c9 site is predicted at E160, and the putative lipase cleavage site is predicted between E160 and T161 (arrow). (C) GP2 is type I integral membrane protein, and the C-terminal 33 amino acids of human DAF were replaced with the C-terminal 53 amino acids representing positions 204 and 256 of PRRSV GP2 to generate DAF/2. This region of GP2 contains a hydrophobic trans-membrane sequence plus a short hydrophilic cytoplasmic tail. Numbers for 204-256 indicate amino acid positions with respect to GP2. migration reduces to 67 kDa (Nickells et al., 1994) . In our study, the molecular migration of human DAF in HeLa cells decreased from 82-88 kDa to 65-70 kDa when digested with PI-PLC (Fig. 4A , lanes 2, 4), which was consistent with the orangutan report. After PI-PLC digestion, fluorescent cells by DAF staining were also reduced by 96% in HeLa cells (Figs. 4, Ba, Ca) , confirming the efficient digestion of DAF by PI-PLC. In contrast, HEK-293 cells transfected with the empty vector pXJ41 showed no fluorescence for DAF (Figs. 4, Bb, Cb) , and no cleavage product was released by PI-PLC digestion (Fig. 4A, lane 6) . Thus, HEK-293 cells were transfected with pXJ41-DAF, pXJ41-DAF/4, or pXJ41-DAF/2, and analyzed by PI-PLC digestion followed by western blot (Fig. 4A) , fluorescence staining (Fig. 4B) , and FACS (Fig. 4C) analyses. DAF/2, DAF, and DAF/4 were all expressed on the cell surface and detectable by DAF-specific MAb EVR1 (Figs. 4B, C; panels c, d, e) . After digestion with PI-PLC, the fluorescence was lost in DAF and DAF/4 expressing cells, and DAF and DAF/4 proteins cleaved by PI-PLC were released to the supernatants, which were then detectable by western blot (Fig. 4A, lanes  10, 12) . In contrast, the intensity of fluorescence and the percentage of fluorescence-positive cells were unaffected for DAF/2 by PI-PLC treatment (Fig. 4B, panel c; Fig. 4C , panel c), and the DAF/2 protein was not detectable in the supernatant (Fig. 4A, lane 8) . These results show that the C-terminal region of GP4 was modified for PI-PLCspecific GPI-attachment, whereas GP2 protein did not undergo such a modification, which is consistent with previous reports that GP2 anchors on the cell membrane through the C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain (Meulenberg et al., 1995; Wissink et al., 2005) .

The PRRSV infectious cDNA clone was modified to place the full-length genomic sequence under the eukaryotic promoter and thus DNA transfection of the full-length genomic clones can produce infectious progeny in transfected cells. Thus, the wild type and mutant genomic clones were transfected into MARC-145 cells and the cells were incubated for 5 days. Cytopathic effects (CPE) were evident for PRRSV-GP4-WT and some of the mutants. Culture supernatants were collected and designated 'passage-1'. For mutants that did not produce visible CPE, extracellular and intracellular RNAs were examined for the presence of viral genome by RT-PCR for N gene at passages 3 and 5. The mutant viruses PRRSV-GP4-M157V (\u03c9 \u2212 3), PRRSV-GP4-E160V (\u03c9), and PRRSV-GP4-T161V (\u03c9 + 1) grew to titers similar to that of PRRSV-GP4-WT (Fig. 6A ), and these were the mutants that did not impair the ability for GPIanchorage in HEK-293 cells. These mutant viruses grew normally and induced CPE typical for PRRSV. Mutation at \u03c9 \u2212 2 (T158V), \u03c9 \u2212 1 (P159V), and \u03c9 + 2 (M162V) appeared to be important for virus growth as the titers for PRRSV-GP4-T158V, PRRSV-GP4-P159V, and PRRSV-GP4-M162V decreased in 'passage 2' and 'passage 3' (Fig. 6A ). Their growth kinetics was also slower compared to that of PRRSV-GP4-WT (Fig. 6B) , and their characteristics were consistent with their fluorescence staining. In particular, PRRSV-GP4-M162V (\u03c9 + 2) appeared to affect the virus infectivity most notably. PRRSV-GP4-M162V grew slowly and its titer was also low. The truncation mutant PRRSV-GP4-M162* did not exhibit any sign of infectivity (Figs. 6A, B) . Furthermore, no viral RNA was detectable at passages 3 and 5 and thus it was concluded that the lack of GPI-anchor, thus the lack of membrane association, was lethal for PRRSV infectivity.",

Since cholesterol is a major component residing in the lipid rafts of the cell membrane, we examined whether lipid rafts were involved in the entry of PRRSV in permissive cells. A cholesterol-depletion experiment was conducted using methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) in both MARC-145 and PAM cells. M\u03b2CD is not incorporated into membranes but extracts cholesterol selectively from membranes by binding it in the central non-polar cavity and thus depleting from the plasma membrane (Ilangumaran and Hoessli, 1998) . To avoid the possibility that the newly synthesized cholesterol and/or cholesterol from internal compartments may restore the rafts and affect the entry of virus, incubation of M\u03b2CDtreated cells with PRRSV was limited to 1 h at 37\u00b0C. It was apparent that the M\u03b2CD treatments of MARC-145 and PAM cells impaired the production of PRRSV in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 7A, B) , suggesting an essential role of cholesterol for PRRSV entry.",

GPI modification has the propensity to target the GPIproteins to lipid rafts (Brown and London, 1998) and since PRRSV GP4 is a GPI-anchored protein, its localization in the lipid rafts was first examined by dual staining immunofluorescence. DAF (a synonym of CD55) is a resident protein in the lipid rafts and thus is frequently used as a marker for lipid rafts (Stuart et al., 2002) . Since HeLa cells constitutively express DAF which is readily detectable by DAF-specific MAb EVR1 (Fig. 2B, lane 4; Fig. 8A ), HeLa cells were used to examine co-localization of GP4 and DAF proteins. The GP4 protein fused with a Flag-tag was detectable on the cell membrane (Figs. 8E,  H) and was co-localized with CD55 (Figs. 8F, I), demonstrating that the PRRSV GP4 protein is a membrane protein localized in the lipid rafts in HeLa cells.",

CD163 has been shown to localize and form high partition in the lipid rafts (Wolf et al., 2007) . Since GP4 co-localizes with DAF (Fig. 8) , colocalization of GP4 with CD163 was examined. For this study, cells of the porcine origin were used to co-express both GP4 and CD163. Dulac cells are porcine kidney cells but non-permissive for PRRSV infection, and thus using these cells, a cell line was generated to stably express porcine CD163 which was then designated Dulac-CD163. Dulac-CD163 cells were RT-PCR positive for CD163 transcription (Fig. 9A, lane 4) and the protein was also expressed (Figs. 9B, C). Dulac-CD163 cells became permissive for PRRSV infection and the GFP expression was evident when infected with PRRSV-P129-GFP virus (Fig. 9D) , confirming the expression of porcine CD163 and infection of PRRSV in these cells. When Dulac-CD163 cells were transfected with pXJ41-Flag-GP4, CD163 and GP4 were found to be co-localized on the plasma membrane (Figs. 10, F, I). These results demonstrate the interaction of GP4 with CD163 in the lipid rafts and suggest that this interaction may participate in the initial stage of virus entry into cells.",

            "text": "The signal for GPI modification of a protein consists of three parts: a stretch of three amino acids including the residue where GPI attaches (the \u03c9 site), a hydrophobic segment of 12-20 amino acids, and a hydrophilic spacer segment of usually less than 10 amino acids between them (Furukawa et al., 1997) . For modification, the hydrophobic segment is first cleaved and the lipid is then attached (Gerber et al., 1992) . The GP4 protein satisfies the above conditions with a hydrophobic segment of 15 residues at the C-terminus and a hydrophilic space of 3 amino acids between the hydrophobic segment and the \u03c9 site (Fig. 1A) . In the present study, we provide evidence that the PRRSV GP4 protein can undergo post-translational modification for GPI attachment and anchors to the membrane via the lipid. The GP4-EGFP fusion protein was cleaved at the \u03c9 site and the 30 kDa peptide was likely the cleavage product representing the C-terminal portion of GP4 fused with EGFP. GP4 existed in two forms to anchor to the membrane, and this observation was consistent with other lipid-anchored proteins such as LFA-3 (lymphocyte functionassociated antigen 3) and NCAM-1 (neural cell adhesion molecule 1) as they also exist in two forms, a hydrophobic peptide-anchored form and a lipid-anchored form (Arai et al., 2004; Cross, 1990; Dustin et al., 1987) . These alternative forms behave differently. The routes (Rothberg et al., 1990 ) and rates (Keller et al., 1992) for endocytosis virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5, and their supernatants were harvested at indicated times. Virus titers were determined by a microtitration infectivity assay and recorded as tissue culture infectious dose (TCID) 50 /ml. Experiments were conducted in duplicate and repeated three times. The data are shown as mean titers \u00b1 standard error. of the GPI-anchored and hydrophobic peptide-anchored proteins differ. In addition to the transport differences, the lipid-anchored and peptide-anchored forms of a same protein can also have different biological properties. The lymphocyte surface molecules Ly-6A/E and Qa-2 only activate T cells when present as a GPI-anchored form (Robinson et al., 1989; Su et al., 1991) .",

This finding confirms that unlike GP4, GP2 is a type I integral membrane protein (Meulenberg et al., 1995; Wissink et al., 2005) . In contrast to DAF/2, DAF/4 was successfully digested by PI-PLC, demonstrating that the C-terminal region of GP4 indeed possessed the GPImodification signal. M157V (\u03c9 \u2212 3), E160V (\u03c9), and T161V (\u03c9 +1) mutations of GP4 did not affect the GPI-modification or the growth of mutant viruses, but T158V (\u03c9 \u2212 2), P159V (\u03c9 \u2212 1), and M162V (\u03c9 + 2) were important for both GPI modification and the virus infectivity. The residues at positions \u03c9 \u2212 2, \u03c9 \u2212 1, and \u03c9 + 2 were highly conserved among different PRRSV isolates of the North American and European genotype, and among those three mutations, M162V",

For PRRSV, CD163 is the cellular receptor (Calvert et al., 2007) and has been recently shown to interact with GP2 and GP4 proteins (Das et al., 2010) . CD163 is a macrophagespecific protein in the cysteine-rich scavenger receptor superfamily comprising a large number of cell surface and soluble glycoproteins involved in the recognition of various ligands of proteins, polyribonucleotides, polysaccharides, and lipids (Sarrias et al., 2004) . The localization of a receptor in the lipid rafts is crucial for entry of some viruses (Ewers and Helenius, 2011) including SV40 and murine leukemia virus (Lu and Silver, 2000; Pelkmans et al., 2001) . For nidoviruses, CD13 is the cellular receptor for human coronavirus 229E and is localized in the lipid rafts (Nomura et al., 2004) , and the importance of lipid rafts for virus replication has also been documented (Lorizate and Kr\u00e4usslich, 2011; Lu et al., 2008; Thorp and Gallagher, 2004) . We show in the present study that GP4 localizes to the lipid rafts of the plasma membrane where it associates with CD163, the cellular receptor for PRRSV. The lipid-modification of GP4 contributes to PRRSV infectivity, suggesting an important role of GPI for PRRSV entry and infection. The DAF/4-M162* mutant was lethal for infectivity, which is probably due to the inability of GP4 to anchor to the membrane, and thus unable to associate with the lipid rafts, supporting the notion that the lipid rafts play an important role for PRRSV infection.",

Compared to peptide-anchored GP4, lipid-anchored GP4 is likely to have the priority to locate in lipid rafts where it binds to CD163 to promote the entry of PRRSV. This may explain why certain mutations affecting the ability of lipid-anchor formation of GP4 on the cell membrane affected the titers and growth of PRRSV as seen in other studies (Metzner et al., 2008) . Taken together, we have shown here that the PRRSV GP4 protein is a GPI-modified membrane-associated protein. Co-localization of GP4 with CD163 in the lipid rafts on the Fig. 8 . Co-localization of PRRSV GP4 and the DAF (CD55) protein as a lipid raft marker on the plasma membrane of HeLa cell. Cells were transfected with pXJ41-Flag-GP4 (D through F) and at 24 h post-transfection, washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then co-stained with DAF-specific MAb EVR1 (anti-CD55; A and D) and rabbit anti-Flag antibody (B and E), followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 488\u00ae conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) and Alexa Fluor 594\u00ae conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H +L) secondary antibodies, respectively. Images were visualized using a laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscope (model BX50, Olympus). Panels G through I represent the enlargement of the indicated areas in panels D through F, respectively. cell membrane implicates an important role of the complex for PRRSV entry and infection. These findings deepen our understanding on GP4 and establish the cholesterol and lipid rafts as potential targets in the development of control measures against PRRSV infection.",

To construct pEGFP-GP4, PRRSV GP4 gene was PCR-amplified from pCMV-S-P129 using the GP4-GFP-Fwd and GP4-GFP-Rev primer pair (Table 1 ) and inserted into EcoRI and BamHI sites in pEGFP-N1 (Clontech; Mountain View, CA). To generate pXJ41-FLAG-GP4, the FLAGtag sequence (YKDDDDKGS) was inserted between nucleotide positions 261 and 262 (corresponding amino acid positions D87 and E88, respectively) of GP4 by three-point ligations of PCR products generated using the primer pairs, FLAG-GP4-A and -B, and FLAG-GP4-C and -D (Table 1) at EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII sites (Fig. 1F) . The human DAF gene was amplified from plasmid pEF6/V5-DAF (provided by K. Dimmock, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada) using DAF-Fwd and DAF-Rev primers ( Table 1 ). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI followed by cloning into pXJ41 to generate pXJ41-DAF. pXJ41-DAF/4 was created by overlapping extension PCR (Horton et al., 1989) . Briefly, the region representing amino acid positions 1-348 of human DAF was amplified from pEF6/V5-DAF using DAF-Fwd and DAF/4-B primers. The C-terminal region of GP4 (GP4-C, positions 144-179; Fig. 1 ) was amplified from plasmid pCMV-S-P129 using primers DAF/4-C and DAF/4-D (Table 1) . Then, overlapping extension PCR was conducted using the PCR products of DAF (1-348 aa) and GP4-C (144-179 aa) as templates and primers DAF-Fwd and DAF/4-D (Table 1 ). The DAF/4 fusion gene (1-348 aa fragment of DAF and GP4-C fragment) was inserted at EcoRI and BamHI sites in pXJ41 to generate pXJ41-DAF/4 (Fig. 3) . Plasmid pXJ41-DAF/2 was constructed in a similar way using GP2-C representing 204-256 aa of GP2 (Fig. 3) . The primer sequences are listed in Table 1 .",

Ten millimolar or higher concentration of M\u03b2CD was found to be toxic for MARC-145 cells and PAMs, and thus 0.25-2 mM concentrations were chosen for subsequent studies. MARC-145 cells and PAMs were treated with variable concentrations of M\u03b2CD for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and infected with PRRSV PA8 at a MOI of 5. After 1 h incubation, cells were washed twice and cultivated in DMEM or RPMI-1640 supplemented with 2% FBS.

The percentage of positive cells for DAF/4-T158V (\u03c9 \u2212 2) was significantly lower (P b 0.05) than those of DAF/4, followed by DAF/4-P159V (\u03c9 \u2212 1), and DAF/4-M162V (\u03c9 + 2)(Fig. 5D, panels b, c, f). Their intensity of fluorescence also decreased in order(Fig. 5C, panels b, c, f;Fig. 5D, panels b, c, f), and DAF released to the supernatant decreased accordingly(Fig.5B, lanes 6, 8, 14). DAF/4-M162*, whose the C-terminal hydrophobic domain was truncated by mutating M162 to the TAG stop codon(Fig. 5A), was anticipated not to anchor the GP4 protein on the cell membrane, and as expected no band was released in the supernatant of the digestion reaction(Fig. 5B, lane 16; Fig. 5C, panel g;Fig. 5D, panel g).",
