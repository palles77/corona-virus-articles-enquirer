Cells were pre-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution buffer (HBSS buffer, 142 mM NaCl, 23.8 mM NaHCO 3 , 5 mM KCl, 1 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 1.2 mM MgSO 4 , 12.5 mM HEPES, 5.0 mM glucose, and 1.5 mM CaCl 2 , adjusted to pH 7.4) with or without CsA, FK506, rapamycin, or PSC833. After pre-incubation, the HBSS was removed completely, and the transport assay was initiated by adding [ 3 H]taurocholic acid (TCA) solution with or without compounds at 37\u00b0C for 5 min. The transport assay was terminated by adding ice-cold PBS containing 0.2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were washed twice with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS, then pelleted cells were solubilized by pipetting in 0.5mL of 0.1 N NaOH. Cell lysate (300 \u00b5L) was combined with 10 mL of scintillator (Hionic-Fluor) in a glass scintillation vial, and the radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (TRI-CARB 2500TR, PerkinElmer). Protein concentration was determined with 20 \u00b5L of the remaining cell lysate using a BCA-protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cleared volume (ml/mg protein) was calculated from the uptake amount (disintegrations/well), protein amount (mg protein/well) and initial concentration (disintegrations/ml). The percent of control (%) was calculated from the ratio of cleared volume in the presence of the compound to that in the absence of the compound. The IC 50 value was calculated from the relationship between the concentration of the compounds and the percent of the control using eq.1: Percent of control (%) = IC 50 /(IC 50 +I) x 100, where I is concentration of the compound (mM).For the HepG2-based transporter assay inFig. 5B, the uptake experiments were performed as described(59,60) by using HepG2 and HepG2-NTCP with modification. The uptake of [ 3 H]TCA was measured at 37 o C for 5 min in HBSS containing 125 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO 4 , 1.2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 1.3 mM CaCl 2 , 5.6 mM D-glucose, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 50 nM [ 3 H]TCA (370 GBq/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc; St. Louis, MO, USA) in the presence or absence of 10 \u00b5M inhibitors as indicated in the figure. NTCP 6 specific TCA uptake values were obtained by subtracting background (HepG2 uptake value)",
