            "text": "For all previously well-characterized oligomeric integral membrane proteins, folding, multisubunit assembly, and recognition of conformationally immature molecules for degradation occurs at their organelle of synthesis. This cannot, however, be the case for the gap junction-forming protein connexin43 (Cx43), which when endogenously expressed undergoes multisubunit assembly into connexons only after its transport to the trans-Golgi network. We have developed two novel assays to assess Cx43 folding and assembly: acquisition of resistance of disulfide bonds to reduction by extracellularly added DTT and Triton X-114 detergent phase partitioning. We show that Cx43 synthesized at physiologically relevant levels undergoes a multistep conformational maturation process in which folding of connexin monomers within the ER is a prerequisite for multisubunit assembly in the TGN. Similar results were obtained with Cx32, disproving the widely reported contention that the site of endogenous \u2424 connexin assembly is the ER. Exogenous overexpression of Cx43, Cx32, or Cx26 allows these events to take place within the ER, the first example of the TGN and ER as alternative sites for oligomeric assembly. Our findings also constitute the first biochemical evidence that defective connexin folding is a cause of the human disorder X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.",

            "text": "The best characterized exception to this dogma is con-nexin43 (Cx43), a very widely expressed member of the connexin family of gap junction-forming integral membrane proteins. Gap junctions are clusters of intercellular channels that transfer ions, second messengers, and other low-molecular-weight substances between the cytosols of adjoining cells (Goodenough et al., 1996) . Defects in gap junction formation and/or function are the cause of at least 10 human disorders, including the second most common inherited peripheral neuropathy, X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMTX) disease (Wei et al., 2004; Alldredge, 2008) . The first step in gap junction assembly is the noncovalent oligomerization of six connexin monomers into a connexon, also known as a hemichannel. Two connexons on apposing cell surfaces then dock head-to-head to form a complete intercellular channel. Using four mechanistically distinct blockers of ER-to-Golgi transport and two independent assembly assays, Musil and Goodenough (1993) demonstrated that oligomerization of endogenously expressed Cx43 into a connexon occurred only after exit of Cx43 from the ER. Additional experiments indicated that connexon assembly takes place within a late Golgi compartment that has the properties of, and will be referred to throughout this study as, the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This novel site of multisubunit assembly was observed in all cell types examined and was subsequently confirmed by another group using similar methods (Koval et al., 1997) .",

            "text": "The discovery of a post-ER oligomerization pathway for an integral membrane protein raises important questions as to how protein synthesis, folding, multisubunit assembly, and quality control are spatially and temporally coordinated in the secretory pathway. In the case of Cx43, one possibility is that folding and oligomerization take place within the same subcellular compartment, but instead of being the ER this organelle is the TGN. Connexins that fail to acquire a native state within the TGN could then be directly delivered to the lysosome or returned to the ER for destruction, perhaps via one or more of the post-ER quality control mechanisms utilized by monomeric proteins (Arvan et al., 2002; Trombetta and Parodi, 2003) . Indeed, trafficking of connexins to either the lysosome Qin et al., 2003) or back to the ER without delivery to the cell surface has been described. Alternatively, connexins could begin the folding process in the ER, but achieve conformational maturation only upon oligomerization into a connexon within the TGN.",

            "text": "A related, medically relevant issue is how disease-causing mutations in connexins prevent their trafficking to the cell surface. For other types of abnormal proteins, intracellular retention can be a result of either an inability to attain a mature conformation, or of the aquisition of an intracellular retention motif and/or the loss of an anterograde transport determinant in an otherwise normally folded protein (Ellgaard et al., 1999) . To date, knowledge of the posttranslational folding of wild-type or disease-causing mutant forms of connexins is very limited because of the lack of biochemical assays or antibodies capable of detecting such conformational changes. Another major question in gap junction biosynthesis is whether post-ER assembly of connexins into connexons is a general feature of the connexin family. Although sharing the same four-transmembrane domain topology and a relatively high degree of overall homology, differences between their primary sequences have led to the categorization of connexins into subfamilies, with Cx43 as the prototypical \u2423 connexin and connexins 32 and 26 classified as \u2424 connexins. Based mainly on studies in which Cx32 was exogenously overexpressed in tissue culture cells (Kumar and Gilula, 1992; Kumar et al., 1995) or ER microsomes (Falk et al., 1997) and on experiments utilizing forms of Cx43 and Cx32 that were mutated to contain an ER retentionretrieval motif (Sarma et al., 2002; Maza et al., 2005) , it has been repeatedly stated in the primary literature (Kumar et al., 1995; Sarma et al., 2002; Gemel et al., 2004; Maza et al., 2005) and in reviews (e.g., Kumar and Gilula, 1996; Saez et al., 2003; Berthoud et al., 2004; Laird, 2005; Solan and Lampe, 2005; Koval, 2006) that Cx32 assembles into connexons within the ER or the ERGIC (endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment). If true, this would imply that the mechanisms than govern the assembly of Cx43 and of Cx32 are fundamentally different and provide an explanation for why \u2423 and \u2424 connexins do not co-oligomerize when expressed within the same cell (Koval, 2006) .",

In addition to providing the initial insights into the process of post-ER assembly of a multisubunit polytopic protein, we demonstrate that disease-linked mutant forms of the \u2424 connexin Cx32 are conformationally abnormal, implicating connexin misfolding as a cause of the first reported connexin-linked disease, CMTX.",

Clonal lines of PC12J cells (a subclone of rat pheochromocytoma cells devoid of endogenous gap junction activity) stably expressing either wild-type human Cx32 or CMTX-linked Cx32 mutants were generated and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% FBS, antibiotics, and 400 g/ml G418 as described by Deschenes et al. (1997) . Expression of endogenous Cx32 in the rat hepatoma cell line MH 1 C 1 (a generous gift from R. Ruch, Medical College of Ohio) was enhanced by culturing for 48 h in the presence of 10 M dexamethasone as previously described (Ren et al., 1994) . HepG2 cells (provided by C.

One-half of the sample was incubated without (control), and the other half with, 1% N-lauroyl sarcosine (N-LS) in the presence of 20 mM DTT for 30 min at 25\u00b0C. The DTT was quenched by addition of 50 mM NEM, and both samples were subjected to centrifugation through a 3.5-ml cushion of 5% sucrose/0.1% TX-114/incubation buffer in a Beckman SW60 rotor (Fullerton, CA) at 49,000 rpm for 12 h at 4\u00b0C. The samples were collected from the tube bottom, brought to 1% TX-114, and subjected to phase partitioning at 30\u00b0C before immunoprecipitation of Cx43.",

As the protein attains its properly folded state, many of these disulfide bonds become buried within the protein's tertiary structure and acquire resistance to this Figure 1 . Acquisition of resistance of Cx43 to reduction of disulfides bonds by extracellularly added DTT. (A-C) NRK cells were pulselabeled with [ 35 S]methionine for 10 min at 37\u00b0C (A and C) or for 30 min at 15\u00b0C (B) and chased for the times indicated at either 37 (A), 15 (B), or 20\u00b0C (C). The intact cells were then subjected to in situ treatment with 2 mM DTT (\u03e9), or mock-treated in the absence of DTT (\u03ea), at the same temperature as the chase as described in Materials and Methods. Cx43 was immunoprecipitated from all samples and analyzed on nonreducing SDS-PAGE gels, as was Cx43 metabolically labeled for 10 min at 37\u00b0C in the continuous presence of 2 mM DTT, which prevents the formation of disulfide bonds (rightmost lane). (D) S180 cells were cell surface biotinylated at 4\u00b0C and then subjected to in situ treatment with either 2 mM (lanes 2 and 5) or 20 mM (lanes 3 and 6) DTT. Biotinylated Cx43 was isolated and then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer in either the presence (lanes 1-3) or absence (lanes 4 -6) of 2% \u2424ME. Cx43 was detected by anti-Cx43 immunoblotting. All immunoprecipitates in A-D were treated with alkaline phosphatase before SDS-PAGE to eliminate phosphorylation-induced shifts in the electrophoretic mobility of Cx43. treatment. The sensitivity of such a protein to reduction by extracellularly added DTT is therefore an assay of its folding status (Braakman et al., 1992; Lodish et al., 1992; Lodish and Kong, 1993; Opstelten et al., 1993; Tatu et al., 1993) . Exposure of intact NRK cells to 2 mM DTT for 5 min immediately after a 10-min pulse caused the majority of immunoprecipitated [ 35 S]met-Cx43 to migrate on nonreducing SDS-PAGE in the same position as fully reduced [ 35 S]met-Cx43 (cf. lane 2 with lane 7), indicating that its disulfide bonds were sensitive to in situ reduction. The remaining pulse-labeled Cx43 continued to migrate as a fully oxidized species. After 30 min of chase, a greater fraction of the [ 35 S]met-Cx43 acquired resistance to in situ reduction (lane 4), becoming completely insensitive by 1 h (lane 6).",

It had previously been shown that Cx43 synthesized at this temperature can undergo all of the folding and assembly steps required to be fully functional when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Musil and Goodenough, 1993) . Figure  1B shows the near quantitative conversion of [ 35 S]met-Cx43 in NRK cells at 15\u00b0C from a DTT-sensitive to a DTT-resistant form, confirming the precursor-product relationship between these two species and establishing acquisition of a DTT-insensitive conformation as a pre-Golgi event (Cx43 also became DTT resistant at 37\u00b0C in the presence of the intracellular transport inhibitor BFA; data not shown). In principle, decreased accessibility of disulfide bonds to extracellularly added DTT could be caused by tight binding of Cx43 to another protein instead of by connexin folding. This possibility is, however, extremely unlikely given that endogenously expressed Cx43 is detected within the ER exclusively as a free monomer by either sucrose gradient sedimentation or chemical cross-linking when synthesized at 15-37\u00b0C (Musil and Goodenough, 1993) .",

Indeed, Cx43 chased at a temperature at which anterograde transport through the secretory pathway is stalled within the TGN (20\u00b0C; Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984; Griffiths and Simons, 1986) was not reduced by extracellularly added DTT ( Figure 1C, lane 4) . To examine Cx43 on the plasma membrane, cultures were cell surface biotinylated under conditions previously shown to restrict conjugation of NHS-LC-biotin to Cx43 on the plasmalemma (Musil and Goodenough, 1991; VanSlyke and Musil, 2005 ; Figure 1D ). Incubation of the intact cells with either 2 mM DTT (lane 5) or 20 mM DTT (lane 6) at 37\u00b0C had no effect on the migration of biotinylated Cx43 on nonreducing SDS-PAGE, indicating that the disulfide bonds had remained intact (cf. with lane 4; note that Cx43 in lanes 4 -6 migrates more rapidly than cell surface biotinylated Cx43 subjected to reduction immediately before SDS-PAGE; lanes 1-3). This is in contrast to certain other proteins, which remain sensitive to DTT-induced reduction of disulfide bonds throughout the secretory pathway (Massague and Czech, 1982) . Taken together, these results are consistent with the possibility that folding of Cx43 to a DTT-resistant conformation is a requirement for its proper assembly and transport to the cell surface.

            "text": "Current biochemical assays for connexon assembly measure the difference in molecular mass between monomeric and hexameric connexin species without providing any information as to the conformational state of the oligomer. Assessing the extent to which a detergent-solubilized connexon is properly folded is becoming increasingly important given the now frequent use of connexons reconstituted into lipid vesicles in the study of connexin channel permeability, gating, and structure (Kim et al., 1999; Thimm et al., 2005; Ayad et al., 2006; Bao et al., 2007; Oshima et al., 2007) . TX-114 is a nonionic detergent highly related to TX-100 that separates into a detergent-enriched (abbreviated hereafter as D) and a less dense, detergent-depleted (aqueous; abbreviated as A) phase when briefly heated above its cloud-point temperature of 20\u00b0C (Bordier, 1981) . Partitioning in TX-114 has been extensively used to distinguish membrane-associated proteins (recovered in the D phase) from more hydrophilic species (recovered in the A phase) (Sanchez-Ferrer et al., 1994) . There are, however, proteins that behave anomalously. For example, Maher and Singer (1985) have reported that the fully assembled pentameric nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channel, a complex comparable in size to a Cx43 connexon that contains a total of 20 transmembrane domains, unexpectedly fractionated into the aqueous TX-114 phase. Several proteins have been reported to undergo conformation-induced changes in TX-114 partitioning (Seth et al., 1985; Sandvig and Moskaug, 1987; Yoshimura et al., 1987; Skern et al., 1991; Martayan et al., 1997; Day et al., 2002) . This includes the insulin receptor, a multimeric integral plasma membrane protein that partitions into the TX-114 detergentenriched phase when unliganded but switches to the aqueous fraction upon insulin-induced changes in conformation (Florke et al., 1993) . Such studies raised the possibility that oligomerization into a connexon and the concomitant change in conformation might cause a switch in the partitioning of Cx43 in TX-114. This was investigated by metabolically labeling NRK cells with [ 35 S]methionine at 20\u00b0C, a temperature that allows trafficking of newly synthesized Cx43 to the site of connexon assembly (the TGN) but inhibits its transport to the cell surface and thus its incorporation into Triton-insoluble gap junctional plaques. The labeled cells were incubated with 1% TX-114 at 4\u00b0C (well below the detergent's cloud-point), and the solubilized material resolved by centrifugation on a 5-20% linear sucrose gradient. If the total TX-114 -soluble lysate was loaded onto a sucrose gradient without prior phase partitioning, two peaks of [ 35 S]met-Cx43 immunoreactivity were resolved that have previously been shown to represent monomeric (5S) and connexon-assembled (9S) forms of the protein (Musil and Goodenough, 1993 ; Figure 2A , T). The lower two gradient profiles in Figure 2A depict the results obtained if the TX-114 -soluble lysate was instead phase-partitioned at 30\u00b0C, and the resulting detergent-rich and aqueous fractions were analyzed separately on sucrose gradients. The detergentrich (D) phase contained monomeric, 5S Cx43, as expected for a typical integral membrane protein, but no detectable Cx43 in the 9S position. Instead, the connexon-assembled, 9S Cx43 was nearly quantitatively recovered in the aqueous (A) phase.",

Cross-linking of the total TX-114-soluble lysate without prior phase partitioning yielded both monomeric Cx43 (M r \u03ed 40 kDa) and a cross-linked \u03f3200 kDa homo-oligomer that has previously been determined to be a connexon (Musil and Goodenough, 1993; lane 2) . When an identically prepared TX-114 lysate was first phase-partitioned and then subjected to cross-linking, the detergent phase contained only monomeric Cx43 (lane 4), whereas Cx43 that could be cross-linked into a connexon was recovered exclusively in the aqueous phase (lane 6). Cx43 from TX-114 lysates that were cross-linked before phase separation behaved identically in that the monomeric and connexon-assembled forms partitioned into the detergent-rich and aqueous fractions, respectively ( Figure 2C ). Comparable results were obtained in other Cx43-expressing cell types (e.g., LA25 NRK cells; HEK293-Cx43 transfectants), if lysates were cross-linked with EGS instead of DSP, or if cells were radiolabeled at 37\u00b0C instead of 20\u00b0C to permit unrestricted transport to the plasma membrane (data not shown).",

            "text": "If partitioning of Cx43 into the detergent-depleted (A) TX-114 phase is causally linked to its assembly into connexons, then it would be expected that 1) Cx43 fractionates into the detergent-rich phase under conditions that block its oligomerization and 2) dissociation of connexons into individual subunits would cause Cx43 to shift from the A to the D fraction. To test the first prediction, NRK cells were metabolically labeled for 4 -5 h at either 37\u00b0C in the presence of BFA or at 15\u00b0C, treatments that block the transport of newly synthesized proteins before the TGN and as a result prevent assembly of endogenous Cx43 into connexons (Musil and Goodenough, 1993) . In both cases, [ 35 S]met-Cx43 partitioned nearly completely into the detergent-rich phase ( Figure 3A , lanes 1-6). A similar result was obtained when cells were pulsed for 10 min at 37\u00b0C, a period previously shown to be too brief to allow significant amounts of the newly synthesized Cx43 to assemble into connexons (Musil and Goodenough, 1993 ; Figure 3A , lanes 7-9). To test the second prediction, we used the nonionic detergent 8-POE. Although somewhat more denaturing than either TX-100 or TX-114, 8-POE is considered to be a relatively mild solubilizing agent and preserves the conformation of most proteins (e.g., Gilboa et al., 1998) . Nonetheless, 0.5-1% 8-POE at 25\u00b0C caused Cx43 connexons to dissociate into monomers as indicated by two types of experiments: 1) Cx43 connexons recovered in the aqueous phase after TX-114 partitioning Figure 2 . Cx43 connexons partition into the TX-114 aqueous phase. NRK cells were metabolically labeled with [ 35 S]methionine at 20\u00b0C to allow radiolabeled Cx43 to assemble into connexons. The cells were then lysed in 1% TX-114 at 4\u00b0C, and the solubilized material analyzed as described below. In A, half of the lysate was subjected to TX-114 phase partitioning at 30\u00b0C into detergent-rich (middle panel, D) and detergent-poor aqueous (bottom panel, A) phases before fractionation on 5-20% linear sucrose gradients. The other half of the lysate was fractionated on gradients without prior phase partitioning (top panel, T). Equal fractions were collected from the sucrose gradients and analyzed for Cx43 content by immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE. In B, one-half of the lysate was TX-114 phase-partitioned into detergent-rich (D) and detergent-poor aqueous (A) phases, and the other half remained unpartitioned (T). The samples were then subjected to chemical cross-linking with DSP (\u03e9) or mock cross-linked with DMSO only (\u03ea) as indicated, followed by immunoprecipitation of Cx43 and SDS-PAGE. In C, the entire lysate was cross-linked with DSP. One-half of the cross-linked lysate was then TX-114 phase-partitioned into detergent-rich (D) and detergent-poor aqueous (A) phases, whereas the other half remained unpartitioned (T). Cx43 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. cxon, connexon; m, monomer.

When the monomeric [ 35 S]met-Cx43 that resulted from 8-POE-induced dissociation of connexons was subsequently subjected to TX-114 phase partitioning, it was recovered exclusively in the detergent phase ( Figure 3B, lane 3) .",

To address if this is the sole determinant of the partitioning behavior of Cx43 in TX-114, we used the harsh denaturing detergent N-lauroyl sarcosine (N-LS). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that, as expected, no oligomeric forms of Cx43 were recovered if connexon-containing TX-114 lysates were exposed to 1% N-LS for 1 h ( Figure 3C, lane 4) . In the experiment shown in Figure 4 , NRK cells were radiolabeled at 20\u00b0C to accumulate [ 35 S]met-Cx43 connexons, after which the cells were lysed with TX-114 at 4\u00b0C and the aqueous (connexon) fraction cross-linked with EGS. The samples were then incubated at 25\u00b0C without additions (control) or with 1% N-LS in the presence of 20 mM DTT (followed by the alkylating agent NEM) to maximize the unfolding of Cx43. After detergent exchange by sedimentation through 5% sucrose/0.1% TX-114, the samples were partitioned in TX-114 at 30\u00b0C. All of the Cx43 from the control (Triton only) sample was recovered in the aqueous phase (lanes 1-3) . In contrast, more than half of the connexons in the N-LStreated sample now partitioned into the detergent-rich phase despite being maintained in a hexameric state by the EGS cross-links (lanes 4 -6). Control experiments (not shown) demonstrated that N-LS pretreatment did not alter the subsequent partitioning of either monomeric Cx43 (in the D phase) or of soluble proteins such as BSA (in the A phase) after the samples had been restored to 1% TX-114. We conclude that the partitioning behavior of Cx43 connexons is sensitive to the conformational state of the Cx43 molecule. The inability of N-LS exposure to quantitatively switch connexons to the D phase could be due to partial renaturation of Cx43 during overnight centrifugation in the absence of N-LS and/or to the presence of intra-and intermolecular EGSinduced cross-links that prevent the protein from unfolding completely. In preliminary studies, we have found that connexons composed of Cx26 partition exclusively into the TX-114 detergent phase, whereas Cx32 connexons are consistently recovered in both aqueous and detergent fractions (not shown). These findings rule out a simple model in which the TX-114 partitioning behavior of connexins can be explained by masking of hydrophobic (TX-114 binding) regions of connexin monomers at subunit interfaces during connexon assembly, and further support the contention that assembly-associated changes in the conformation of Cx43 underlie its partitioning behavior.",

To determine the site of assembly of endogenously expressed, wild-type Cx32, HepG2 hepatoma cells were metabolically labeled at 37\u00b0C in either the absence or presence of BFA before lysis at 4\u00b0C in TX-100 and chemical cross-linking. BFA is one of three inhibitors of ER-to-Golgi transport previously shown to block connexon assembly of endogenous Cx43 in multiple cell types (Musil and Goodenough, 1993 ; see Figure 5C ). Although BFA did not reduce the amount of [ 35 S]met-Cx32 synthesized, anti-Cx32 immunoprecipitable complexes migrating at the position of a hexameric connexon were recovered only from the untreated cells ( Figure 5A, lanes 1-4) .

The former process can be selectively inhibited by incubating cells with BFA in the presence of monensin (Barzilay et al., 2005) . Control experiments in which acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance of the N-linked glycoprotein LCAM was used as an assay of ER-Golgi mixing confirmed that addition of 10 M monensin efficiently inhibited Golgito-ER retrograde transport in BFA-treated HepG2 cells (Supplemental Figure 1S ). As was observed with BFA alone, [ 35 S]met-Cx32 synthesized in the presence of both BFA and monensin remained monomeric ( Figure 5A, lane 7) . We conclude that the lack of Cx32 assembly in BFA-treated HepG2 cells is a direct result of blocking trafficking of We next examined the site of assembly of exogenously expressed Cx32 in stable HeLa and NRK cell transfectants. In both cell types, Cx32 formed intercellular gap junctions as assessed by anti-Cx32 immunolocalization (data not shown), as expected from the findings of others (Mitic et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 1999; Kleopa et al., 2002) . Unlike in HepG2 cells, however, the ability of [ 35 S]met-Cx32 to be cross-linked into a connexon was not blocked when exit of newly synthesized protein from the ER was prevented by BFA ( Figure 5C, lanes  1-8) . NRK cells endogenously express Cx43, previously shown to oligomerize into connexons in a BFA-inhibitable manner (Musil and Goodenough, 1993) . The presence of Cx32 did not alter this sensitivity (lanes 9 -12), indicating that the same cell can simultaneously support the assembly of (exogenous) Cx32 in the ER and (endogenous) Cx43 within the TGN. Cx32 also formed connexons within the ER in stable PC12 cell transfectants ( Figure 5B, lanes 4 -6) , but not in MH 1 C 1 hepatoma cells in which Cx32 is native (lanes 1-3) .",

One possible explanation for these findings is that the site of oligomerization is dictated not by the connexin species, but by the level at which the connexin is synthesized such that overexpression results in premature assembly within the ER. This was tested using C6 glioma cells, which endogenously synthesize low levels of Cx43, and two stably Cx43-transfected clones that express Cx43 at levels either threefold (Cx43-14 cells) or 30-fold (Cx43-13 cells) higher than the untransfected parental cells (Zhu et al., 1991; Charles et al., 1992; Naus et al., 1992) . Anti-Cx43 immunocytochemistry verified relatively uniform expression of Cx43 within each cell line, with little cell-to-cell variation (Supplemental Figure 2S ). Assembly of 35 [S]met-Cx43 was inhibited by the inclusion of BFA in the labeling medium in both the parental ( Figure 6A, lane 4) and low-expressing (lane 6) cells. In contrast, connexons could readily be cross-linked from the high-expressing cell line even in the presence of After labeling, all cells were lysed in TX-100, and the solubilized material was either cross-linked with EGS (\u03e9) or mock cross-linked with DMSO only (\u03ea). Anti-Cx32 or (5C, lanes 9 -12) anti-Cx43 immunoprecipitates were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To minimize nonspecific background on the gels at M r \u03fe100 kDa, the concentration of anti-Cx32 antibody used for the MH 1 C 1 immunoprecipitates was reduced to below that required to efficiently recover connexin monomers. Immunoprecipitation of uncrosslinked samples with saturating amounts of anti-Cx32 antibody verified that the input levels of [ 35 S]met-Cx32 in the samples analyzed in lanes 1-3 in panel B were equivalent (not shown).",

Connexons formed in C6 Cx43-13 cells in the presence of BFA met both of these criteria (Figure 6 , B and C). Moreover, they were recovered in the detergent-depleted (aqueous) fraction after phase partitioning in TX-114 ( Figure 6D ). The latter finding further supports the contention that the partitioning behavior of Cx43 is determined by its oligomeric state and not by its intracellular location. [ 35 S]met-Cx43 synthesized in the continuous presence of levels of DTT that prevent intramolecular disulfide bond formation (see Figure 1A , lane 7) could not be cross-linked to a connexon in BFA-treated C6 Cx43-13 cells ( Figure 6E, lane 4) . Because connexons can form within the ER in Cx43-13 cells, this lack of connexon assembly cannot be attributed to an inhibitory effect of DTT on connexin transport. Instead, this finding is in keeping with a direct requirement for disulfide bonds in wild-type connexon assembly.",

Distinguishing between these two mechanisms is of therapeutic significance given that relieving ER retention can rescue the cell surface localization and function of the latter class of mutant membrane proteins (Kupershmidt et al., 2002; Chang et al.,1999; Taschenberger et al., 2002) .

We found that the disulfide bonds in newly synthesized, pulse-labeled wild-type Cx32 were initially sensitive to reduction by extracellularly added DTT but rapidly acquired resistance to in situ DTT treatment, similar to what was observed for Cx43 ( Figure 9A ). Because of the efficiency of this process, virtually all of the wild-type Cx32 labeled under near steady-state conditions (4-h pulse) in PC12 cells at 37\u00b0C was insensitive to extracellularly added DTT ( Figure  9B ; note that the bands in lanes 1 and 2 comigrate).

High-level transient overexpression of Cx26 switches the site of onset of connexon assembly to the ER. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with one of two Cx26-encoding plasmids: a CMV-driven construct with an intact polyA tail (lanes 1-4) or a SV40driven construct in which the polyA tail had been deleted that expressed \u03f360-fold lower levels of Cx26 protein (lanes 5-8). On day 2 after transfection, the cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine for 4 h at 37\u00b0C in either the absence (\u03ea BFA) or presence (\u03e9 BFA) of BFA.

Unlike for wild-type Cx32, however, in situ treatment with DTT caused the electrophoretic mobility of R142W Cx32 (cf. lane 3 with lane 4) and E208K Cx32 (cf. lane 7 with lane 8) to decrease. Results for E186K Cx32 were intermediate between those obtained with WT Cx32 and the other two mutants, suggesting that at least some of the disulfide bonds in a fraction of the labeled E186K Cx32 molecules had become resistant to in situ DTT treatment (cf. lane 5 with lane 6). Similar conclusions were drawn from studies using an alternative method to assess disulfide bond integrity in which a decrease in electrophoretic mobility denotes DTT resistance (Supplemental Figure 5S ). Taken together with our finding that oligomerization of wild-type Cx32 in PC12 transfectants does not require ER exit ( Figure 5B ), these data implicate abnormal folding rather than faulty trafficking as the reason why these mutants fail to assemble into connexons.",

For all other previously described oligomeric proteins, the quality control machinery recognizes unassembled monomers as incompetent to exit the ER. In the case of connexins, however, it must be able to discriminate between two forms of connexin monomer: one incapable of ever reaching a mature, fully folded state (e.g., those that fail to acquire resistance to in situ reduction of intramolecular disulfide bonds) and another that has attained an intermediate level of folding in the ER. The former type of molecule (exemplified by the E208K, R142W, and E186K Cx32 mutants) is identified as abnormal, retained intracellularly, and destroyed, whereas the latter is permitted to undergo connexon assembly upon transport to the TGN and is delivered to the cell surface. These findings may shed light on the biosynthesis of proteins suspected, but not yet proven, to be capable of oligomerization in post-ER compartments (e.g., HIV-1 Vpu and gp160; Otteken et al., 1996; Hussain et al., 2007) .",

That this conformational change is an important, most likely necessary, step in gap junction biosynthesis is supported by three findings: 1) both an \u2423 (Cx43) and a \u2424 (Cx32) connexin acquire resistance to in situ reduction by DTT; 2) all connexin molecules detectable on the cell surface are DTTresistant, and 3) three of three of the CMTX-linked Cx32 mutants studied in which disulfide bonds form but remain DTT-sensitive are incompetent to assemble into connexons and are not delivered to the plasma membrane. Given that two of the aforementioned Cx32 mutants are capable of being transported to the Golgi, acquisition of DTT resistance does not appear to be a requirement for ER exit. These abnormal molecules must instead be recognized by post-ER quality control mechanisms that either transport them back to the ER (E186K Cx32) or to the lysosome (R142W Cx32) for degradation.",

            "text": "A major new finding of this study is that the multisubunit assembly of an integral plasma membrane protein can take place in more than one intracellular compartment. The site at which connexon formation is initiated is not dictated by connexin species, cell type, or whether the connexin is natively expressed by the cell. Instead, the level of connexin synthesis appears to be the major determinant of the location of oligomerization. In all cases examined, assembly within the ER of Cx43 or 32 synthesized endogenously or at endogenous levels (e.g., C6 -14 cells) was near or below the limit of detection. Appreciable assembly in the ER of Cx43, Cx32, and Cx26 occurred only after connexin overexpression in either stable or transient transfectants. The simplest explanation for our findings is that oligomerization into connexons, similar to the later stages of gap junction formation (Valiunas et al., 1997; Castro et al., 1999) , is largely a concentration-driven self-assembly process. Under physiologically relevant conditions, the concentration of Cx43, Cx32, and Cx26 subunits required for connexon oligomerization may not be achieved until the TGN. Diez et al. (1999) examined the oligomeric state of native Cx32 and Cx26 solubilized under nondenaturing conditions from subcellular fractions prepared from guinea pig liver. Both connexins migrated on sucrose gradients in the position expected for a bona fide, discrete connexon from membranes derived from either gap junctions or the Golgi, but not from membranes enriched in the ER or the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. Although not interpreted as such by the authors, these data are consistent with the conclusion that \u2424 as well as \u2423 connexins undergo assembly into connexons within the Golgi in vivo. The dominantly inherited deafness-associated Cx26 mutant D66H has been reported to accumulate in a perinuclear compartment (Marziano et al., 2003) demonstrated by Thomas et al. (2004) to be the TGN. Expression of wild-type Cx26, Cx32, and Cx30 (all \u2424 connexins) results in its redistribution to the cell surface, consistent with the possibility Figure 9 . Folding of wild-type and CMTX-linked mutant forms of Cx32. (A) Wild-type Cx32 stable NRK cell transfectants were pulselabeled with [ 35 S]methionine and chased for the times indicated at 37\u00b0C. The samples in lanes 2, 4, 6, and 7 were prepared from cells subsequently subjected to in situ treatment with 2 mM DTT at 37\u00b0C. Cells were lysed in SDS, Cx32 was immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed on SDS-PAGE under either nonreducing (lanes 1-6) or reducing (R; lane 7) conditions. (B) PC12 cell lines stably expressing either wild-type (WT) Cx32 or the indicated disease-causing Cx32 point mutants were metabolically labeled for 4 h at 37\u00b0C before (even lanes) in situ treatment with 2 mM DTT at 37\u00b0C. Cx32 immunoprecipitates were analyzed on a single nonreducing SDS-PAGE gel in the order shown. The decrease in electrophoretic mobility of the Cx32 mutants after in situ DTT treatment indicates the presence of DTT-sensitive disulfide bonds. that the wild-type and mutant proteins formed heteromeric connexons within the TGN that were responsible for the dominant-negative effect of D66H Cx26 on wild-type Cx26 function (Thomas et al., 2004) . Delaying connexon assembly until the TGN may serve to prevent premature formation of gap junctions within the ER cisternae, which has been observed after massive overexpression of Cx32 in BHK transfectants (Kumar et al., 1995) . In light of our findings, results obtained from studies in which connexins are exogenously expressed at high levels must be interpreted cautiously with regard to the mechanism or functional consequences of connexon assembly.",

            "text": "Given the relatively large size of the gap junction pore and the evidence that multiple transmembrane domains contribute to its lining (Fleishman et al., 2004) , oligomerization into a connexon is likely to involve significant conformational changes within each connexin subunit. The alternative possibility would be that connexin monomers become fully folded within ER, but are normally prevented from cooligomerizing within that compartment by a tightly bound \"spacer\" protein that is removed only after arrival in the TGN. Our data do not support such a model for several reasons. First, neither chemical cross-linking nor velocity sedimentation in isocratic sucrose gradients provide any evidence for association of wild-type Cx43, Cx32, or Cx26 with another protein before connexon assembly. Second, our demonstration that each of the connexins studied can be induced to assemble into connexons within the ER shows that the TGN is not unique in its ability to support subunit oligomerization. Third, although connexin monomers newly liberated from such a putative spacer protein would be expected to coassemble with each other in a step-wise manner to form subcomplexes containing 2-5 connexin subunits, such assembly intermediates are not observed for Cx43. It could be argued that the amount of spacer protein available to prevent ER assembly is limited, leading to connexon formation within the ER when its capacity is exceeded by exogenous overexpression of connexins. We have shown, however, that although overexpression of Cx32 in LA25 NRK cells causes it to assemble within the ER, oligomerization of endogenous Cx43 within the same cells remains confined to the TGN ( Figure 5B ). This would necessitate the existence of multiple, connexin-specific spacer proteins, at least some of which would have to be synthesized by cells that do not constitutively express their client connexin (e.g., Cx26 in HepG2 cells). We favor the alternative explanation that formation of a connexon involves conformational changes within the individual connexin monomers initiated by their coassociation into complexes containing six connexin subunits. Given that conformational changes have been invoked as the reason for the anomalous partitioning of certain other integral membrane proteins in TX-114 (Florke et al., 1993) , it is possible that this is also the basis for the shift in TX-114 partitioning of Cx43 upon its assembly into connexons. To our knowledge, Cx43 is the first integral membrane protein that has been shown to undergo a posttranslational switch in TX-114 partitioning as a result of oligomerization into a channel.",

            "text": "Lastly, our studies allow us to add CMTX to the growing list of diseases linked to point mutations that cause protein misfolding. Before this work, the extent to which any CMTX-linked Cx32 point mutant was conformationally abnormal could not be assessed. Our previous finding that the three Cx32 mutants investigated are not aggregated and have near wild-type rates of turnover , combined with the report that E186K Cx32 and R142W Cx32 can associate with coexpressed wild-type Cx32 in Xenopus oocytes (Bruzzone et al., 1994) , raised the possibility that they may be retained within mammalian cells because of relatively minor structural defects that expose a retention motif or mask an anterograde transport signal. The results presented here indicate instead that these proteins fail to properly undergo the first known step in connexin folding (acquisition of resistance to in situ reduction of disulfide bonds) and that this defect is responsible for their lack of connexon assembly even when expressed under conditions in which ER exit is not required for multisubunit oligomerization. Strategies to correct E208K, E186K, and R142W Cx32 must therefore focus on restoring proper folding instead of on disabling the mechanisms responsible for their intracellular retention.",
