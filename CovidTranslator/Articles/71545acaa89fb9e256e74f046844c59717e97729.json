A total of 7 dilutions (8 samples S1-S8 134 including the starting stock) were tested by both RT-PCR and dPCR assays. As shown in Figure 1 and 135 Table 2 RT-PCR failed to detect S3, while dPCR was able to detect S3 and S4. dPCR showed 136 negative results for S5 through S8. dPCR assay showed at least 10 times lower LLoD than RT-PCR 137 assay.

The patient's specimens were subsequently tested 176 by RT-PCR and dPCR on February 5th and February 21. After 13 days of treatment (Feb. 5 th ), RT-177 PCR couldn't detect any virus from pharyngeal swab.
