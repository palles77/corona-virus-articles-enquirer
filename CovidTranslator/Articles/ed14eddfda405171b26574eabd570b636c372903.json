The nsp4 proteinase was expressed either fused to maltose binding protein or carrying a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Following purification, the nsp4 moiety of MBP-nsp4 was successfully used for structural studies [Barrette-Ng, I., 2002. Structure of arterivirus nsp4-the smallest chymotrypsinlike proteinase with an alpha/beta C-terminal extension and alternate conformations of the oxyanion hole. J. Biol. Chem. 277, 39960-39966]. Furthermore, both forms of the EAV proteinase were shown to be proteolytically active in two different trans-cleavage assays. Recombinant nsp4 cleaved the cognate nsp6/7-and nsp7/8 site in in vitro synthesized substrates. In a synthetic peptide-based activity assay, the potential of the recombinant proteinase to cleave peptides mimicking the P9-P7 residues of six nsp4 cleavage sites was investigated. The peptide representing the EAV nsp7/8 junction was used to optimize the reaction conditions (pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 30% glycerol at 30 \u2022 C), which resulted in a maximum turnover of 15% of this substrate in 4 h, using a substrate to enzyme molar ratio of 24:1. The assays described in this study can be used for a more extensive biochemical characterization of the EAV main proteinase, including studies aiming to identify inhibitors of proteolytic activity.",

RNA virus polyproteins that include replicative proteins are often processed autocatalytically, although in some virus groups cellular proteinases are also involved. In this manner, the expression of the non-structural proteins (or \"replicase\" complex) can be regulated in time and space, e.g. to produce alternative cleavage products or stable processing intermediates with unique functions (de Groot et al., 1990; Jore et al., 1988; Lemm et al., 1994; Ypma-Wong et al., 1988) .",

(A) Processing map of the 3175-amino acid EAV replicase polyprotein pp1ab. The three EAV proteinases (PCP\u2424, CP and SP), their cleavage sites and the EAV nsp nomenclature are depicted.

(B) Overview of the two alternative processing pathways that apply to EAV pp1a (Wassenaar et al., 1997) . The association of cleaved nsp2 with nsp3-8 (and probably also with nsp3-12) was shown to be a cofactor in the cleavage of the nsp4/5 site by the nsp4 proteinase (major pathway). Alternatively, in the absence of nsp2, the nsp5/6 and nsp6/7 sites are processed and the nsp4/5 junction remains uncleaved (minor pathway). The status of the small nsp6 subunit (fully cleaved or partially associated with nsp5 and/or nsp7) remains to be elucidated. Adapted from Barrette-Ng et al., 2002. the 5 -proximal three quarters contain the replicase gene. The 3 -proximal region of the genome includes seven open reading frames encoding the viral structural proteins, which are expressed from a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (de Vries et al., 1990; Snijder and Meulenberg, 2001) . Replicase gene expression ultimately yields (at least) 12 non-structural proteins ( Fig. 1A ; Snijder et al., 1994; van Dinten et al., 1996; Wassenaar et al., 1997) , which are produced from two primary genome translation products, the large polyproteins pp1a (1728 amino acids) and pp1ab (3175 amino acids), with the latter being expressed following a ribosomal frameshifting event (den Boon et al., 1991) . The replicase subunits are released from the polyproteins by three virus-encoded proteinases (Fig. 1) , of which the one located in nsp4 is responsible for the processing of the polypeptides that remain after nsp1 and nsp2 have been autocatalytically released from pp1a and pp1ab (Snijder et al., 1992 (Snijder et al., , 1994 (Snijder et al., , 1995 van Dinten et al., 1999; Wassenaar et al., 1997) . Since nsp4 controls the production of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, it has been termed the EAV \"main proteinase\" (Gorbalenya et al., 1991; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) .",

The arterivirus proteinase combines the catalytic triad His/Asp/Ser of canonical chymotrypsin-like proteinases with the substrate specificity of the 3C-like cysteine proteinases, a subgroup of chymotrypsin-like enzymes named after the picornavirus 3C proteinases. In the cleaved, 204-residue EAV nsp4 (which equals Gly-1065 to Glu-1268 of the EAV replicase polyproteins) the catalytic triad is formed by His-39, Asp-65, and Ser-120. Cleavage sites recognized by the nsp4 proteinase carry a Glu at the P 1 position (Gln in one case) and a small amino acid (Gly, Ser, Ala) at the P 1 position (using the cleavage site nomenclature of Schechter and Berger, 1967) . Furthermore, nsp4 possesses a unique C-terminal domain (CTD) extension of unknown function, which is not found in most other chymotrypsin-like proteinases and might be involved in modulation of nsp4 activity (Barrette-Ng et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Expression plasmids pMalTnsp4 and pET-nsp4His were constructed using standard recombinant DNA techniques and sequenced. The pMalT2i vector, a derivative of expression plasmid pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs; Wassenaar and Snijder, unpublished data) uses the strong tac promoter and the malE translation initiation signals to give high-level expression of the cloned sequences. Target genes in the pET plasmid are under control of the strong bacteriophage T7 promoter. (i) Construction of pMalTnsp4. A NcoI-XhoI restriction fragment from plasmid pL3440, encoding EAV nsp4 (Wassenaar et al., 1997) , was cloned into plasmid pBlN+ (Molenkamp, 2000) . The resulting plasmid (pL3440i) was digested with BamHI and XhoI and the desired fragment was cloned between the unique BamHI and SalI restriction sites of pMalT2i. This plasmid (pMalTnsp4) encoded the EAV nsp4 proteinase fused to the C-terminus of the E. coli maltose binding protein (MBP), with a (Asn) 10 spacer and a thrombin cleavage site (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg/Gly-Ser) separating the MBP and nsp4 moieties of the fusion protein, which will be further referred to as MBP-nsp4. Due to the cloning strategy, MBP-nsp4 lacked Glu-204 (nsp4 numbering) and contained three additional amino acids at its C-terminus (Leu-Ala-Ser; Fig. 2C ). After digestion with thrombin, also the N-terminus of the protein carried three foreign amino acids (Gly-Ser-Met; Fig. 2C ). (ii) Construction of pET-nsp4His. pL3440-E1268P (Wassenaar et al., 1997) After cell lysis and ultracentrifugation (100,000 \u00d7 g) the S100 fraction (lane 3) was loaded on an amylose affinity column and bound protein was eluted with buffer A supplemented with 10 mM maltose (lane 4). After an overnight incubation at 4 \u2022 C with 1 unit of thrombin per mg of MBP-nsp4 (lane 5), cleaved nsp4 was further purified by gel filtration (Sephadex G-75), anion exchange chromatography, and repeated loading of the sample on an amylose column until a purity of more than 90% was reached (lane 6). Although mass-spectrometry indicated that the purified nsp4 was homogeneous, the sample migrated as a double band, a repeatedly observed phenomenon with nsp4. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, which was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. (B) Expression and purification of nsp4His. Samples were total lysates from non-induced (lane 1) and IPTG-induced (lane 2) cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pET-nsp4His or fractions made during purification (lanes 3-6). After cell lysis and ultracentrifugation, the S100 fraction was loaded on a Talon affinity column (Clontech) charged with cobalt chloride. Samples were taken from the flow-through (lane 3), after washing the column with buffer D (lane 4), and with buffer D supplemented with 10 mM imidazole (lane 5). The bound nsp4His was eluted from the column with buffer E (lane 6). For buffer composition see Section 2. As judged from the gel, the purity of the sample was more than 90%. (C) Nucleotide-and amino acid sequences corresponding to the termini of the nsp4 gene in the MBP-nsp4 and nsp4His expression constructs. Foreign amino acids are shown in bold face and indicated with \"n\" or \"c\". The top panel shows N-and C-termini of wild-type nsp4, which is produced from the EAV replicase polyproteins by autoproteolysis of the nsp3/4 and nsp4/5 sites (indicated with \u2193). Both pp1a and nsp4 amino acid numbers are given. The middle panel shows the MBP-nsp4 fusion protein. After cleavage by thrombin, compared to native EAV nsp4, three foreign amino acids (Gly-Ser-Met) remain at the N-terminus. The amino acid sequence recognized by thrombin is underlined and the position of the thrombin cleavage site is indicated (\u2193). At the C-terminus of MBP-nsp4, due to the cloning strategy, the native Glu-204 was replaced by a Leu residue and two additional amino acids were introduced (Ala-Ser). The bottom panel shows the nsp4His protein. A translation initiation codon was added, resulting in an N-terminal foreign Met residue upstream of the native P 1 Gly residue. At the C-terminus of nsp4His, the native Glu-204 was replaced by a Gly residue, which is followed by the (His) 6 tag. was digested with restriction enzymes NcoI and StuI and the desired fragment was cloned into a NcoI and BamHI-digested pET34h vector (Wassenaar and Snijder, unpublished data) together with a BamHI-digested Gly-(His) 6 -encoding linker (5 -GGGCATCACCATCACCATCACTAAGGGCTGCAGCC-AAGCTGACGGATCC-3 ). The resulting plasmid encoded nsp4 with an additional Met at its N-terminus and a C-terminal (His) 6 tag ( Fig. 2C) . As a precaution, Glu-204 (the P 1 residue of the nsp4/5 cleavage site) was substituted with Gly to ensure that the (His) 6 tag would not be cleaved off as a result of nsp4 activity. The resulting protein will be further referred to as nsp4His. The active site mutation Ser-120 to Ile, which was documented to inactivate the nsp4 proteinase , was transferred to pET-nsp4His and the mutant protein (nsp4His-S120I) was used as a negative control in the activity assays. (iii) Construction of pLnsp6-8 and pLnsp6-7. pLnsp6-8 was constructed by self ligation of a NcoI and SmaI digested pL1aE1451P plasmid of which the NcoI site was filled in using the 5 \u2192 3 polymerase activity of the large (Klenow) fragment of DNA polymerase I. pLnsp6-7 was a derivative of pLnsp6-8, in which the sequence (5 -TATGAAGGCCTA-3 ) encoding the P 2-P 2 residues of the nsp7/8 cleavage site was replaced (by 5 -CTAGCTAGCTAGA-3 ), changing Tyr-Glu-Gly-Leu to Leu-Ala-Ser-Stop.",

Subsequently, 1 ml of the overnight culture was used to inoculate a 3-1 flask containing 1 l of LBA. Cultures were grown at 37 \u2022 C to an OD 600 of 0.7 and subsequently protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM of isopropyl-\u2424-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).

During the purification procedure, samples and buffers were kept at 4 \u2022 C. The pelleted cells were resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and lysed by passing them twice through a 40 K French pressure cell (SLM-Aminco) at 1000 psi (6.9 MPa). Subsequently, the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min, resulting in a supernatant (S100) and a pellet (P100) fraction. The S100 fraction was loaded onto an amylose affinity column (New England Biolabs), which was washed with buffer A until the OD 280 of the flowthrough dropped below 0.05. Subsequently, the bound fusion protein was eluted from the column in 3-ml fractions using buffer A supplemented with 10 mM maltose. Fractions containing the MBP-nsp4 fusion protein (as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis) were pooled and the concentration of the fusion protein was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Biorad). Generally, 1 l of culture yielded about 50 mg of fusion protein. Fusion protein-containing fractions were diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated for 16-18 h at 4 \u2022 C with 1 unit of thrombin (from human plasma; Sigma) per mg of fusion protein.

Briefly, after induction of expression, large amounts of MBP-nsp4 fusion protein were recovered from the soluble S100 fraction ( Fig. 2A) and purification of the protein using an amylose resin affinity column yielded a more than 90% pure fusion protein (as judged from Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stained protein gels). To prevent exposure of the nsp4 proteinase to relatively high temperatures, the release of nsp4 from the MBP moiety by cleavage with thrombin was not performed at the recommended temperature of 25 \u2022 C, but at 4 \u2022 C. An overnight digestion with 1 unit thrombin per mg of fusion protein was sufficient to cleave virtually all of the fusion protein ( Fig. 2A) . Nsp4 was further purified by anion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and repeated loading of the nsp4-containing samples onto an amylose resin affinity column to remove all remaining traces of MBP. Due to the cloning strategy, nsp4 lacked the C-terminal Glu-204 residue (nsp4 numbering) and carried three additional amino acids at its extreme C-terminus (Leu-Ala-Ser). After cleavage by thrombin, also the N-terminus of the proteinase remained attached to three foreign residues (Gly-Ser-Met) (Fig. 2C) . Although mass spectrometry indicated that the purified nsp4 sample was homogeneous and of the expected molecular mass, there were two bands visible on the gel ( Fig. 2A) , which were both recognized by a nsp4-specific antiserum (data not shown). It has been reported before that nsp4, with a predicted molecular mass of 21 kDa, migrates as a 30 kDa protein . Presumably, nsp4 is prone to aberrant migration during SDS-PAGE. Nevertheless, the recombinant protein obtained using this protocol was of sufficient purity and homogeneity to be successfully used for crystallogenesis and the subsequent nsp4 structure determination by X-ray crystallography (Barrette-Ng et al., 2002) .",

Based on the specific affinity of histidine residues for cobalt ions, a convenient one-step purification could be performed using a chelating agarose column charged with cobalt chloride. We reasoned that the (His) 6 tag purification could be more efficient compared to the MBP-mediated purification, as it circumvents the potentially harmful thrombin treatment and does not include the laborious removal of MBP. The protocol described below essentially followed the original manufacturer's protocol for C-terminally His tagged proteins (described in Section 2). However, some adjustments had to be made regarding the induction of protein expression. When an overnight liquid culture of pET-nsp4His-transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) bacteria was used to inoculate a larger culture, induction of protein expression with IPTG was, for unknown reasons, not successful. However, nsp4His synthesis could be induced in cultures grown for shorter periods of time or in colonies picked from freshly transformed plates. Therefore, instead of using an overnight liquid culture as an inoculum, a droplet from a 3 h culture was plated on a LBA plate, which was incubated overnight at 37 \u2022 C, sliced into small pieces, and then added to LBA-containing flasks. With this method large cultures could be grown to the right density in a short period of time. After harvesting, lysis, and centrifugation of the cells, the S100 fraction was loaded on a column packed with Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) charged with cobalt ions and the column was washed extensively with several buffers (see Section 2) to remove contaminating proteins. After the elution of Nsp4His from the column, the protein was more than 90% pure, as judged from a Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stained SDS-PAGE gel, and generally a yield of 15 mg of nsp4His protein per 1-l culture was obtained (Fig. 2B) . Active site mutant nsp4His-S120I was purified using the same protocols and yielded comparable quantities of protein. With this expression-and purification protocol, nsp4His could be purified within 8 h, whereas the MBP-nsp4 expression, cleavage and purification protocol would generally take 2 days. The differences between the amino acid sequences at the N-and C-termini of both expression products, and their comparison to the termini of native EAV nsp4, are depicted in Fig. 2C .",

Substrates represented EAV nsp6-7 and nsp6-8, which are naturally occurring processing intermediates of the minor processing pathway (Wassenaar et al., 1997) . Aliquots from in vitro translation reactions were incubated with purified recombinant nsp4His or nsp4His-S120I. Samples were taken at 0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after addition of proteinase and analyzed on 15% tricine SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3) . Processing of the two substrates could be easily monitored since cleavage of the nsp6/7, nsp7/8 or both sites resulted Fig. 3 . EAV nsp4His activity in an in vitro cleavage assay. Using the TnT system (Promega), expression plasmids encoding EAV nsp6-7 and nsp6-8 were in vitro transcribed and the resulting RNA was in vitro translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [ 35 S] methionine. After a 90-min incubation at 30 \u2022 C, transcription and translation were stopped (for details see Section 2). Subsequently, from a typical 25 l reaction, 3-l aliquots were taken and incubated with 5 g of purified nsp4His or nsp4His-S120I (negative control) for up to 120 min in a total reaction volume of 15 l. Samples were analyzed on a 15% tricine gel and labelled products detected by autoradiography using a Phosphoimager (Biorad). The in vitro assay yielded the expected processing products, as predicted from known nsp4 cleavage sites. In addition, a number of smaller cleavage products was detected (indicated with arrows), which may be derived from internal cleavage of nsp7 (see text). Processing products nsp6 and nsp8 were not detected due to their small size of 2.3 and 5.5 kDa, respectively. in a substrate size reduction of 2.3, 5.5, or 7.8 kDa, respectively. Fig. 3 illustrates that after a 15-min incubation with nsp4His about half of the nsp6-7 substrate had been processed, although the remaining substrate was processed much slower. Similar results regarding the processing of the nsp6/7 site were obtained with the nsp6-8 substrate, but the second cleavage site in this substrate (the nsp7/8 site) was processed much faster. Already after 15 min, almost no nsp6-8 or nsp7-8 could be detected, suggesting that the nsp7/8 site had been cleaved in all of the available substrates (Fig. 3) . Surprisingly, processing of each of the substrates produced several additional products (indicated with arrows in Fig. 3 ). These were not observed after incubation with the inactive control enzyme nsp4His-S120I or when the reaction was performed without enzyme, suggesting that the generation of these products depended on the proteolytic activity of nsp4His. Based on their sizes, these products may have been derived from internal cleavage of nsp7, a possibility that is currently being investigated in more detail.",

In the initial experiment, 10 g of each peptide (final concentration approximately 100 M) was incubated at 25 \u2022 C with 37.5 g of either nsp4His or nsp4His-S120I (both at a concentration of 18 M), or without nsp4 proteinase, in a 100-l volume of a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA.

As an example, the results for peptide 222-36, representing the nsp7/8 cleavage site, are shown in Fig. 4 . Following incubation with nsp4His, the main peak representing the uncleaved peptide was reduced and the peptide was apparently converted into two new products. Incubation with nsp4His-S120I or an assay without nsp4His did not yield these two new peaks, indicating that they were derived from nsp4His activity. When mass spectrometry was used to analyze the two newly formed products, it was found that the peaks with retention times of 8 and 9.7 min (Fig. 4) were of the same mass as the C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of the peptide, respectively, assuming cleavage at the Glu/Gly bond representing the established EAV nsp4 cleavage site in this substrate. All peptides could be cleaved under the selected conditions (approximately 25% hydrolysis after 6 h) without obvious differences between the peptides being detected (data not shown). The peptide representing the nsp7/8 cleavage site was selected to further optimize reaction conditions because of its slightly higher cleavage potential.",

Therefore, to investigate whether a differently purified nsp4 proteinase might perform better, the catalytic activity of nsp4His proteinase was compared to that of a partially purified MBP-nsp4 proteinase. The MBP-nsp4 protein was not further purified after the thrombin cleavage step, but instead the cleaved fusion protein sample was directly used in the peptide cleavage assay. A similar experimental set-up using HCV 229E 3CLpro had shown that such a limited purification did not negatively affect the ability of the proteinase to cleave peptides (Ziebuhr et al., 1995) . However, the enzymatic properties of the partially purified EAV MBP-nsp4 were not different from those of the (His) 6 tagged nsp4 proteinase (data not shown), suggesting that the low catalytic activity had a different cause. The possibility of inhibition of the proteinase by contaminants or instability of the enzyme after storage was investigated by an additional wash on the column Fig. 4 . EAV nsp4His activity in an in vitro cleavage assay using synthetic peptide substrates. One hundred micromolars of peptide 222-36 was incubated with 10 M nsp4His according to the protocol described in Section 2 and reaction products were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC. The results are shown for a reaction without proteinase (panel A) and a reaction to which nsp4His had been added (panel B). By using mass spectrometry, the peaks with retention times of 8 and 9.7 min in the HPLC profile of the sample incubated with nsp4His were identified as the C-terminal-and N-terminal fragments, respectively, of the 222-36 peptide substrate. with 60% isopropanol (Franken et al., 2000) or by using the purified protein directly in the assay instead of after storage at 4 \u2022 C or \u221280 \u2022 C. However, the additional washing step did not increase catalytic activity and no differences were found between a freshly prepared sample and preparations stored at 4 \u2022 C for 3 days or stored at \u221280 \u2022 C for 2 weeks. This indicated that catalytic activity was not lost during storage, but was already low upon isolation of the enzyme, possibly due to the purification method and/or intrinsic properties of nsp4. Alternatively, the parameters of the in vitro cleavage reaction might have been suboptimal. To address the latter possibility, the catalytic activity of nsp4His was compared at different temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 37 \u2022 C) using the starting buffer composition (20 mM Tris pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Although hydrolysis of the peptide turned out to be slightly faster at 37 \u2022 C, the differences in comparison to the other temperatures were marginal (data not shown).",

The pH range tested included 6 (25 mM MES), 7 (25 mM MOPS), 8 (25 mM Tris), and 9 (25 mM glycine) and these pH values were combined with NaCl concentrations of 25, 500, and 1000 mM and glycerol concentrations of 10, 20, and 30%. After a 4-h incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 l of 10% trichloroacitic acid and samples were analyzed using reversed-phase HPLC. Since the peak with a retention time of 8 min, representing the C-terminal part of the peptide, had a very low absorbance at 215 nm, only the peak with a retention time of 9.7 min (Fig. 4) was quantified by integration. Samples could not be quantified when less than 3% of the substrate was cleaved. Although differences in catalytic activity were observed using the different buffers, no significant improvements were found compared to the starting reaction conditions in which 15% of the substrate was cleaved during a 4-h incubation at 37 \u2022 C. In the pH 6 buffer and at NaCl concentrations of 500 and 1000 mM, the catalytic activity of nsp4 was even below detection limit. No significant differences were found between reactions performed at pH 7, 8, or 9, but catalytic activity seemed slightly enhanced by increasing the concentration of glycerol (data not shown). Since high NaCl concentrations inhibited nsp4His activity, cleavage conditions were further optimized by titrating the NaCl concentration with 50-mM increments between 0 and 500 mM at a pH of 7.5 (25 mM MOPS) and a glycerol concentration of 10%. Although the catalytic activity was slightly higher at glycerol concentrations of 30%, a lower concentration was chosen for technical reasons. However, increasing the NaCl concentration above 25 mM only reduced the catalytic activity in the assay (data not shown). Finally, the effect of the presence of 10 mM DTT and 2.5 mM EDTA on catalytic activity was investigated, but addition of these compounds did not make a detectable difference (data not shown).",

            "text": "Although the processing kinetics of in vitro synthesized substrates by nsp4His seemed comparable to that of, e.g. the distantly related human coronavirus 229E 3CL pro in an identical experimental set-up, this was not true for the synthetic peptide cleavage assays. Despite our efforts to improve the performance of the enzyme by testing a variety of reaction conditions, nsp4 was unable to cleave more than 15% of its substrate during a 4-h incubation, whereas studies using the human coronavirus 229E and SARS-coronavirus 3CL pro enzymes reported complete conversion of a comparable amount of substrate in less than 2 h, using a 10-fold lower enzyme concentration compared to that used in our nsp4 experiments (Shi et al., 2004; Ziebuhr et al., 1997) . A possible explanation for this discrepancy is the lack of nsp2 in our assay, which was suggested to act as nsp4 cofactor in the polyprotein processing via the major pathway in vivo (Wassenaar et al., 1997) . In the Flaviviridae family, the NS4A cofactor (Hepatitis C virus) and the NS2B cofactor (Dengue virus type 2) have been shown to enhance in vitro NS3 proteinase activity up to 100-fold (Steinkuhler et al., 1996; Yusof et al., 2000) . Yet another explanation may be found in the observations made during the crystallographic studies of nsp4 of Barrette-Ng et al. (2002) , who reported that three out of four copies of nsp4 in the unit cell had a collapsed oxyanion hole, which would render the proteinase practically inactive. If the majority of the purified nsp4His and MBP-nsp4 molecules would have had such a collapsed oxyanion hole, this might explain the low activity of both proteinases. Possibly this is a consequence of nsp4 expression in E. coli, since both forms of the proteinase (MBP-nsp4 and nsp4His) displayed low proteolytic activity. Expression in a different system (e.g. insect cells or yeast) might give better results. Also, we cannot rule out that the foreign amino acid residues present at either the N-or C-terminus of the recombinant nsp4 might have inhibited its proteolytic activity. In coronavirus main proteinases, the N-terminus was found to be of critical importance to the geometry of in particular the S1 subsite, suggesting that changes (or extensions) in this part of the protein may adversely influence proteolytic activity (Anand et al., 2002) . If this property is shared with the distantly related arterivirus main proteinase, this might explain the finding of the collapsed oxyanion hole (Barrette-Ng et al., 2002) in the majority of the molecules. Although it seemed that either only a small part of the purified nsp4 was proteolytically active or that the catalytic activity of the enzyme was low, the cleavage of cognate sites in both assays confirmed the specificity of the E. coli-derived nsp4 proteinase. Thus, the work described in this study may lay the groundwork for the more extensive biochemical characterization of the EAV main proteinase, including studies aiming to identify inhibitors of proteolytic activity.",
