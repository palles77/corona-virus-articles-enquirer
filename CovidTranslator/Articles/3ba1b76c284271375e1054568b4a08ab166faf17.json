            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an endemic disease of chickens and a major contributor to economic losses for the poultry industry despite vaccination. Recent observations indicated that chicks may have an immature immune system immediately after hatching when vaccinated for IBV. Therefore we hypothesized that early IBV vaccination will generate an immature, poorly protective IBV-specific immune response contributing to immune escape and persistence of IBV. To test this hypothesis the IBV-specific immune response and immune protection were measured in chicks vaccinated at different ages. This demonstrated a delayed production of IgG and IgA plasma antibodies in the 1, 7 and 14-day-old vaccination groups and also lower IgA antibody levels were observed in plasma of the 1-day-old group. Similar observations were made for antibodies in tears. In addition, IgG antibodies from the 1-day-old group had lower avidity indices than day 28 vaccinated birds. The delayed and/or lower antibody response combined with lower IgG avidity indices coincided with increased tracheal inflammation and depletion of tracheal epithelia cells and goblet cells upon IBV field strain challenge. The lack of vaccine-mediated protection was most pronounced in the 1-day-old vaccination group and to a lesser extent the 7-day-old group, while the 14-day-old and older chickens were protected. These data strongly support IBV vaccination after day 7 post hatch.",

The second IBV immunization on day 14 of age, which by itself is fully protective, does not completely compensate for the premature priming on day 1 [8] . Field studies by de Wit et al. [3] demonstrated a lack of protective immunity when birds were boosted between day 8 through day 13 of age. The percentage of birds in a commercial flock positive for IBVspecific IgM antibodies was correlated with vaccine protection and increased with the age of boosting. This data supports the notion that early vaccination and boosting of the IBV immune response may limit induction of protective immune responses to IBV. Unlike the study by Gelb et al. [8] , the de Wit et al. [3] study can also be interpreted that maternal antibodies interfere with vaccine delivery during the first 2 weeks of life [13] .",

The splenic T cells from 1 day old chicks even produce inhibitory factors for proliferation of mature T cells in vitro [15] . Furthermore, splenic lymphocytes of 40 day old chicken displayed better antigen specific proliferation after oral Salmonella exposure than 10 day old chicken [16] . When measuring gene expression in lung and trachea in 1 and 4 week old birds after avian influenza exposure a reduced expression of immune-related genes was shown and included innate immune response genes in the younger birds [17] . Additional evidence that innate immune mechanisms are diminished in young chickens was demonstrated by a lower Salmonella phagocytic index of heterophils during the first few days of life [18] . Thus, early exposure to pathogens or vaccines may induce suboptimal innate and adaptive immune responses.",

This time point was selected based on the literature in which the peak IgM response was observed between 5-9 days after virus challenge or live virus vaccination [26] [27] [28] . Due to the variability of IBV-reactive IgM in the controls between different age groups, independent controls were included for each age group. The IgM levels in the controls decreased considerably by \u223c2 week of age after (7 days after the day 7 old chick vaccination) which increased one week later and stabilized in older age control groups (Fig. 1E) . The day 14 through day 28 control IgM levels were significantly higher than in the day 1 and day 7 age group controls. And the day 7 control was significantly lower than the day 1 control IgM levels. All IgM titers from the IBV vaccinated age groups were significantly higher when compared to their controls (P < 0.05) with exception of the day 21 age groups (P = 0.08). This was due to higher control values, which were \u223c1.6 fold higher than in the age 14 or 28 days old groups. This may reflect an initial peak of natural antibodies induced to IBV before stabilizing. The IBV vaccinated age groups did not differ significantly in IgM antibody levels to IBV with exception of the day 1 IBV vaccinated group, which mean \u00b1 SE was 8.7 \u00b1 0.6 had significantly lower IBV-specific IgM levels in plasma than the day 14 (10.2 \u00b1 0.4) day 21 (10.6 \u00b1 0.7) and day 28 (11.2 \u00b1 0.5) vaccinated birds but did not differ significantly from the day 7 (9.2 \u00b1 0.5) vaccinated birds (Fig. 1E) .

IBV vaccination on day 1 of age, which is routinely performed in the poultry industry, will not be fully protective and as a consequence the chicks remain vulnerable to IBV exposure. Thus, early vaccination perpetuates the IBV problems and is a factor in the estimated $48 million or more annual loss to the poultry industry due to IBV infection [30] . Our measurements of mucosal and systemic antibody levels demonstrates a delayed production of IgG and IgA plasma antibodies in the day 1, day 7 and 14 of age vaccination groups. IgA antibody levels in the day 1 group, unlike IgG antibodies, do not recover later in the response. Besides delayed IgG kinetics, the day 1 group displays also a lower avidity index than the day 28 vaccinated group. Lower avidity index is not observed in IgA antibodies. The delayed and/or lower antibody response and lower IgG avidity index translated in increased tracheal inflammation and depletion of tracheal epithelia cells and goblet cells upon IBV challenge when compared to chicks vaccinated later in life. A lack of vaccine-mediated protection is most noticeable in the 1 day of age vaccination group and to a lesser extend the day 7 vaccination group, while the day 14 and older vaccinated chickens are protected.",

The day 21 group was not quite significant (P = 0.08) because of higher IgM levels in the control group. This could be due to an initial surge of natural IgM antibodies to IBV in this age group. A significant decline in the 7 day old group is observed when comparing the IgM antibody levels to IBV in the control day 1 group. This would be consistent with a drop of presumably natural maternal IBV-specific IgM antibodies in these SPF chickens in the day 7 control age group. These IgM antibodies rapidly increases in the day 14 group after which they stabilize in the older age groups. This indicates that a considerable portion of IgM antibodies in plasma from the older vaccination groups reacts with IBV without seeing the virus, indicating these are natural antibodies to IBV, which only increase after day 14 of age. Bacterial colonization of the intestinal tract of chickens is established during the first two weeks post-hatch [31] . This, combined with the observation that probiotics enhance natural antibodies in chicken [32] , indicates that IBV-specific natural IgM antibodies to IBV are possibly generated following intestinal colonization presumably by stimulating B1 cells, which are the main producers of natural IgM antibodies in sera of mammals [33] . In the IBV vaccinated groups we see a steadily incline of IgM IBV-specific antibodies in plasma with age as has been reported by De Wit et al. [3] . Only the day 1 age group displays significantly lower IgM antibody levels when compared with the day 14-28 age groups but not with the day 7 age group.

Increased antibody affinity maturation to virus vaccines strongly correlated with better protection [34, 35] . A lack of antibody affinity maturation observed following vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus was due to a lack of TLR stimulation [35] . This indicates that 1-day-old birds may be deficient in TLR expression. Evidence that this is the case comes from a recent publication [36] demonstrating, that significantly lower levels of TLR7 expression in spleen and small intestines were observed when comparing 1-day-old chicks with 4-to 5-week-old chickens. Inclusion of TLR activating adjuvants could alleviate the problems of early vaccination by boosting antibody production and affinity maturation in 1-day-old chicks. Neither monomeric plasma nor dimeric tears-derived IgA [37] displays this drop in avidity index for the day 1 vaccinated group (Fig. 3B,D) . Although there is a lower level of IgA antibodies produced by the day 1 vaccinated birds compared to the older groups, which is consistent with a delay in class-switching in the day 1 old group, it is not clear why the lack of a mature mucosal immune system in the 1-day-old group [5, 6, [11] [12] [13] did not result in lower affinity maturation of mucosal IgA antibodies compared to the 4-week-old group.",

There exists a linear relationship with the hens' plasma antibody levels and transfer of IgY to the chicks' circulation [14] . Chicks were over 95% protected against IBV challenge on day 1 if they had high levels of maternal antibodies but less than 30% protected when challenged on day 7. This protection correlated with local respiratory antibodies and not serum antibodies [38] . IBV-specific maternal antibodies decreased the induction of neutralizing antibodies following boosting [38] . Despite this inhibition by maternal antibodies of the memory response, low or erratic maternal antibody titers to IBV in broiler flocks are associated with IBV-induced economic losses [39] . This further supports that protection by maternal antibodies, which are predominantly of the IgG isotype, is important to prevent activation of an immature immune system that is not capable generating a fully protective immune response early in life.",

However, in these studies day 1 vaccination was followed with a second vaccination two weeks later for optimal protection against challenge, which would have masked the relative poor IBV-specific immune responses after the day 1 immunization. Extensive immunization on the day of hatch containing three different live attenuated viruses, which caused severe vaccine symptoms, provided similar protection as two single live attenuated IBV virus vaccines on day of hatch and day 14 of age when challenged with a heterologous virus [42] . This seems to indicate that induction of cross-protective immunity may be less impaired when vaccinated early in life. However, no direct comparison of the same vaccination protocol was analyzed between these two challenge groups, which makes this data harder to interpret in the context of age-dependent immune responses.",

This results in a poorly protective immune response as is demonstrated by subsequent IBV field strain challenge. Therefore, it is advisable for the poultry industry based on our data to change their practice from vaccinating chicks on day 1 of age to vaccinating after day 7 of age.",
