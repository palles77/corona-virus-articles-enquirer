            "text": "The varied clinical signs and symptoms of SARS have limited the success of such a triage system (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . We have observed that current diagnostic guidelines may not be sufficiently sensitive for assessing patients before admission to hospital. For example, although a temperature of >38\u00b0C is part of the diagnostic criteria (2), this symptom was notably absent in two patients. The lack of a fever in casepatient 4 may have been the result of long-term steroid use. Case-patient 6 never had a documented temperature >37.7\u00b0C and was hypothermic throughout his hospitalization. In addition, a subset of patients may have fever and myalgias without respiratory complaints or chest x-ray (10). We expanded our isolation criteria to include all patients with undifferentiated febrile illness and chest x-ray infiltrates with or without fever or respiratory symptoms until an alternative diagnosis is made, or until they defervesce and serial chest x-ray findings are normal. The nonspecific symptoms of this illness often require establishing a history of contact with a SARS patient as a critical clue to the diagnosis (2). However, a contact history may not be forthcoming at the initial interview. In Singapore, SARS is an imported infection in which the epidemiology remains well defined with clear lines of secondary spread in the hospitals and community (3). Emphasis is placed on using local epidemiologic clues to elicit a history of visits or previous admissions to Tan Tock Seng Hospital or other healthcare facilities and to inquire whether any family members are ill or hospitalized. Patients without a contact history are still isolated if the clinical suspicion is high. A national computerized database of SARS patients and their contacts has been established to assist with this process. An epidemiology team is also used to perform more exhaustive contact tracing and liaisons with other healthcare facilities. This team also monitors and investigates any clusters of pneumonias within our hospital. Suspected case-patients are then immediately transferred to the isolation area for further investigation.",

These wards are subdivided into cubicles of four to eight beds and have open windows and ceiling fans with no controlled airflow patterns. Another likely factor was the failure to implement a policy of universal PPE use early in the outbreak. Where such measures were implemented (i.e., isolation rooms), no nosocomial transmission occurred. In addition, because hospital staff are a recognized source of secondary transmission (3, 4, 6) , all healthcare workers are now required to monitor their temperatures three times a day.
