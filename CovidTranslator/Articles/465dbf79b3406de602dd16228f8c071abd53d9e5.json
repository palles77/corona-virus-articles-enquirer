            "text": "Adenoviruses are common pathogens that are responsible for a wide variety of infectious syndromes. The objectives of this study were to identify and characterize members of different adenovirus species at the molecular level and to describe the correlation between viruses and clinical syndromes during a period of 4 years. Between 2002 and 2006, 45 of 512 respiratory specimens (8%) from patients with acute respiratory tract infection tested positive for adenovirus. Four adenovirus isolates from samples sent for enterovirus isolation were also analyzed. This research identified 49 confirmed cases of human adenovirus infection by PCR and/or viral culture. The most common diagnosis was upper respiratory infection (44%). Human adenovirus D was the major species found (59%), followed by Human adenovirus C (36%) and Human adenovirus B (4%). Human adenovirus 5 was the major serotype found producing bronchiolitis, followed by human adenovirus 6. In patients with upper respiratory infection, the major serotype found was human adenovirus 17. Viruses of the species Human adenovirus D were identified in seven (77%) cases of acute febrile syndrome. Four isolates from clinical materials obtained from patients with encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis and meningoencephalitis were identified as belonging to the species Human adenovirus D. Our data demonstrate a surprising result about the identification of an unusual association of viruses of the species Human adenovirus D with different clinical syndromes. This observation could be evaluated as a possible indicator of the emergence of a novel strain but further studies are required.",

Respiratory viral agents usually have characteristic seasonal patterns in temperate and tropical climates. In temperate climates, the majority of isolations of respiratory viruses are in the winter. In Central America, there are few studies published about the epidemiological characteristics of adenoviruses. The Cuban island is located in the Caribbean Sea at the entrance of the Gulf of Mexico. The climate of Cuba is semitropical, and two seasons are generally recognized: a rainy season from May to October and dry season from November to April. Cuba is often hit by hurricanes from June to November, resulting in great economic loss and temporarily interrupted sanitary conditions. The average minimum temperature is 21\u00b0C (70\u00b0F), and the average maximum is 27\u00b0C (81\u00b0F). The warmest month is July with 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F). In this study, adenovirus was detected throughout the year; however, two significant outbreaks of HAdV infection were identified, the first in July of 2005, when Hurricane Dennis hit severely the western part of Cuba, and the second in September of 2006. We believe that the effect of temperature and rainfall appears to be a determinant of the timing of those outbreaks.

HAdV-D are rarely isolated in respiratory illness surveys, and strong causal correlations are generally lacking. Nevertheless, this association was previously described by Casas et al. [7] . On the other hand, HAdV-D was identified in a group of patients with acute febrile syndrome and in four isolates from clinical materials obtained from patients with encephalitis, AFP and meningoencephalitis. Sporadic cases or small outbreaks of neurological disease following adenovirus infection are well documented [12, 17, 25, 38] .

We recognize that the limited sequence data analyzed (370 nt in a relatively conserved region of the hexon) for typing did not generate enough results. The sequencing of the hypervariable regions of the hexon gene (HVR7 alone or HVR1-6) and fiber gene of select strains will certainly provide a solid basis for confirming the species/serotype identification [29, 37, 43] . We used the method previously published by Casas et al. [7] , to facilitate sequencing and typing of HAdVs using the hexon protein coding region of the HAdV genome. This method was extensively validated using clinical samples and prototype strains, and we also noted unusual associations between specific serotypes and clinical presentation. The primers and PCR conditions have also been extensively validated. Some years ago, adenovirus infection was considered to have little consequence. However, much has changed since these early epidemiological studies were conducted. In contrast to the modest number of HAdVs recognized 35 years ago, 51 unique serotypes are now recognized, and a new serotype isolated recently (52) has been proposed to belong to a new species G. Different serotypes have been found to have different tissue tropisms that correlate with different clinical manifestations of infection. Partial epidemiological investigations have revealed that, among some specific serotypes, multiple genetic variants exist that often have quite different geographical distributions and associated virulence [19, 21, 28, 30] .",

In contrast, serotypes of HAdV-D could be involved in the aetiology of acute respiratory infection and neurological disorders in previously healthy people. However, this observation needs to be confirmed in a larger study.",
