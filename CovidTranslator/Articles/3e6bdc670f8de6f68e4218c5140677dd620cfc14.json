            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly infectious pathogen, which affects the respiratory tract, reproductive system, and kidney of chickens. Many different genotypes of IBV are recognized which cause different clinical manifestations. According to the antigenic differences, different serotypes of the virus do not cross-protect. Massachusetts serotype induces the best cross-protection against other serotypes. Recently, the IBV QX genotype has been detected in Iran. QX genotype causes permanent damage to the oviduct in layer and breeder flock if it occurs in the early life cycle. In this study, we compared two vaccination program using 793/B type and Massachusetts type vaccine. One-day-old SPF chickens were divided into four groups. Groups 1 and 2 were unvaccinated groups. Group 3 was vaccinated with the H120 vaccine at day 1 and 793/B at day 14 (eye drop), and group 4 was vaccinated with H120+793/B (eye drop) on the first day and 793/B at day 14. Groups 2, 3, and 4 challenged (oculonasal) with QX genotype (10 4 EID50) at day 35. Five days post challenge, the sample were clollected for ciliostasis test, histopathology, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR from trachea, lung, and kidneys. Results showed that two vaccination programs created more than 80% of protection against challenge virus, but no significant difference was recorded between two programs. Based on our results, it can be concluded that vaccination with two mixed vaccines (H120+793/B) on the first day of the life of a chick does not make any difference in comparison to single vaccine (H120) in reducing of pathological damages and viral load. As long as the second vaccination against IB may not be applied properly in farm situation, applying the mixture of 793/B type vaccine with H120 at day 1 (ocular or spray) may help to increase vaccination program efficacy.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a Gamma coronavirus that causes a highly contagious disease in chickens (Cavanagh 2005) . The virus causes severe economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide because it can affect the upper respiratory and reproductive tracts, and some strains can cause nephritis in chickens (Lim et al. 2015) . IBV genome consists of positive-stranded RNA, with 27.6 kb in length. The 3\u2032 end of IBV genome is approximately 7.0 kb in length and encodes four structural proteins, of which the spike protein (S), localized on the IBV particle surface, is composed of two subunits, namely, S1and S2 (Huo et al. 2016) . The S1 subunit, located on the outside of virion, is responsible for the fusion between the virus envelope and the cell membrane of the host (Jackwood 2012) . Different serotypes have been reported worldwide, and new variant serotypes continue to be recognized (Jackwood 2012) . In September 1997, an outbreak of the disease (QX outbreak), characterized mainly by swelling of the stomach (Proventriculitis), diarrhea, and loss of body weight in 25-to 70-day-old chickens occurred in chicken flocks in Qingdao, China (Wang et al. 1998 ). However, it was not recognized as a novel type of IBV at that time (Liu and Kong 2004) . Bozorgmehri-Fard et al. (2013) have demonstrated the presences of QX viruses in Iranian commercial flocks, and after this outbreak, many false layers were reported in Iran. If the QX enters to flock before 10 days old, it causes a permanent effect on oviduct lead to blind layers. As QX vaccine does not have a permit to use in Iranian flock, just Massachusetts and 793/B-like vaccines are being used (Bozorgmehri-Fard et al. 2013) . Currently, the rate of QX in Iranian flocks is around 8% and is reported from several countries (Hosseini et al. 2015) . Several strains have been developed as vaccines strains, including IBV vaccine strains H120, M41, and 793/B. Since IBV is epidemic in both industrial and backyard chickens, flocks are vaccinated from birth with either attenuated live or inactivated IBV. The IBV H120 strain, an attenuated live vaccine strain of the Massachusetts (Mass) type, is widely available and reliable vaccine strain that is used as a primary vaccine in broilers, breeders, and future layers. Also, several 793/B type vaccines (793/B; IB88; 1/96) are using as IB vaccine in combination with Mass type (Yang et al. 2016) . The most usual approach for protection of flocks for most IBV genotypes is using heterologous vaccines for example Mass (1 day old) and 793/B type (12-14 days old) vaccines against QX. The aim of this study is to evaluate the different vaccination programs against QX challenge.",

Each group in all experiments was kept in a separate negative pressure isolators. They were provided with food and water ad libitum. Groups were vaccinated and challenged as shown in Table 1 . Groups 1 and 2 were kept as negative control (non-vaccinated, non-challenged) and positive control (non-vaccinated-challenged group), respectively. The chicken in groups 3 and 4 were vaccinated with Mass (H120; Ceva Sante Animale) and 793/B vaccines (4/91; Intervet), in two programs using an eye drop. Group 3 received H120 and 793/B vaccines in days 1 and 14, respectively. In group 4, chickens were vaccinated with H120 in day 1 and H120+793/ B in day 14. Thirty-five days post rearing, chickens were challenged using nasal route (104 EID50). Before challenging, sera samples were taken from the birds to evaluate ELISA titers of IBV vaccination using IDEXX kit (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., USA). Five days after challenge, samples were taken from trachea and kidneys for histopathology, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and cilliary activity of the trachea. The challenge virus was isolated from commercial broiler farm. Homogenized samples were inoculated into 9-11 embryonated SPF eggs. Primary diagnosis of the IBV was done using 5\u2032-UTR in PCR test. The QX virus was selected and passaged in SPF egg. Challenge virus was tested in nested RT-PCR and S1 gene was sequenced and submitted to NCBI (accession no. KT583570.1). It was shown to be free from contamination by other avian pathogens such as Newcastle disease virus, avian influenza virus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, reovirus, mycoplasma, and other bacteria using molecular detection methods and cultivation. EID50 was calculated by the Reid-Muench method.",

Real-time PCR for IBV detection based on 5\u2032-UTR was used in this study. Realtime PCR amplification was done with the amplification kit (Bioneer, South Korea) with a forward primer (5\u2032-GCTT TTGAGCCTAGCGTT-3\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032-GCCA TGTTGTCACTGTCTATTG-3\u2032) and Taqman dual-labeled probe (FAMCACCACCAGAACCTGTCACCTC-BHQ1) (Callison et al. 2006) . The 5\u2032 UTR of M41reference IBV strain and 28s rRNA of chick tissue were amplified using the same primers applied in real-time PCRreaction. The PCR products were examined using agarose gel electrophoresis. After ethidium bromide staining, the bands were visible only at the expected molecular weights (a 143-bp fragment for 5\u2032-UTR of M41 and 61-bp fragment for 28srRNA). The PCR products for 5\u2032-UTR and 28s rRNA were cloned in a pTG19-T vector and transformed in Escherichia coli TOP10 competent cells. Plasmid isolation kit mini-preparation (molecular biological system transfer, Tehran, Iran) was used to extract plasmids. Before use, the plasmid concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at 260 nm and calculated as genomeequivalents (copies) per milliliter as the ELISA titer, ciliostasis score, tracheal viral load, and kidney viral load are shown in all groups a,b,c,d There was a non-significant difference (P \u22640.05) between the non-vaccinated-challenged group with vaccinated groups molecular weight of the plasmid was known. Serial dilutions were performed togive a final concentration between 102 and 105 (for 5\u2032-UTR) and 102 and 105 (for 28s rRNA) copies for generating the standard curves (Najafi et al. 2016a ).",

            "text": "In this study, we have chosen a combination of Mass (H120) and 793/B serotype in two programs. Several clinical studies have revealed that using of two or more attenuated IBV live vaccines could make a vast protection immunity against heterologous serotype (Cook et al. 1999) . A study by De Wit et al. (2011) revealed that combination of Mass (day 1) + 793/B (day 14) vaccines, and challenge with D388 (QX genotype) on day 28th in commercial broiler breeder, could make 51% and 74% protection in ciliostasis test on 5 and 7 days post challenge, respectively (de Wit et al. 2011 ). In the present study, the chicken received the vaccine by eye drop administration based on a suggestion by Cook et al. (Cook et al. 1999 ). In the present study, vaccinated group 4 (day 1: H120+793/B and day 14: 793/B) showed higher ciliostasis protection (84%) in comparison to vaccinated group 3 (day1: H120 and day14: 793/B) with 81% of protection; the difference was not significant, however. It has been concluded that combination of two serotypes at day 1 could induce a significant increase in expression of CD+, CD8, and IgA-bearing B cell in comparison to single H120 vaccination that leads to higher level of cellular and local immunity at the trachea (Awad et al. 2015; Lambrechts et al. 1991) . It should be kept in mind that in the best condition in the cross-protection experiment, 10% of vaccinated bird would not present sufficient immunity even against homologous strain (Winterfield et al. 1976 ), demonstrating that chickens are different in response to IBV vaccination. In our study, group 4 showed a higher antibody in day 35 demonstrating better protection in internal organs facing IBV strain. It has been proved that cytotoxic T cells are the major blood cells protecting the body in the early stage of IBV infection and IgG circulating in blood serum support the internal organs including ovaries and oviduct in the later stage of the disease (Collisson et al. 2000; Raj and Jones 1997) . The essential issue in IBV infection is to protect trachea from virus lesions. The inconvenient situation in the house including high ammonia, dust, CO 2 , and another microorganism in the air would make the condition worse (Habibi et al. 2017 ). In the present study, the vaccinated groups 3 and 4 showed a slight lesion in the trachea in comparison to the no-vaccinated-challenged group. In the positive control group, the Fig. 7 Histopathology of the lung.

Furthermore, it is proved that both vaccination programs could reduce the IBV lesion in the trachea. Due to widespread and continuous changes in IBV and emergence of new variant, making of new vaccine for each variant is not economically possible; therefore, the solution facing with new variant is to apply available commercial vaccine in a program to make broad crossprotection against these new viruses. The emergence of new IBV variant named QX has caused several problems in poultry flocks specially layers and breeders. It should be noted that in farm situation, drinking water vaccination is the preferred method usually done by the farmer and as long as this method is not as efficient as eye drop, using H120+793/B at day 1 could make better protection. Furthermore, higher antibody titer protects the kidney, oviduct, and internal organs facing the disease. However, further studies are needed to investigate other vaccination program to control IBV infections in Iranian poultry farms.",
