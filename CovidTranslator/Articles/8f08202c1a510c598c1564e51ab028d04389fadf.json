Their face-touching behavior was observed via videotape recording. Using standardized scoring sheets, the frequency of hand-to-face contacts with mucosal or nonmucosal areas was tallied and analyzed. Results: On average, each of the 26 observed students touched their face 23 times per hour. Of all face touches, 44% (1,024/2,346) involved contact with a mucous membrane, whereas 56% (1,322/2,346) of contacts involved nonmucosal areas. Of mucous membrane touches observed, 36% (372) involved the mouth, 31% (318) involved the nose, 27% (273) involved the eyes, and 6% (61) were a combination of these regions. Conclusion: Increasing medical students' awareness of their habituated face-touching behavior and improving their understanding of self-inoculation as a route of transmission may help to improve hand hygiene compliance. Hand hygiene programs aiming to improve compliance with before and after patient contact should include a message that mouth and nose touching is a common practice. Hand hygiene is therefore an essential and inexpensive preventive method to break the colonization and transmission cycle associated with self-inoculation.",

            "text": "Infections may be transmitted by self-inoculation. Self-inoculation is a type of contact transmission where a person's contaminated hands makes subsequent contact with other body sites on oneself and introduces contaminated material to those sites. 1, 2 Although the literature on the mechanisms of self-inoculation of common respiratory infections (eg, influenza, coronavirus) is limited, [3] [4] [5] contaminated hands have been reported as having potential to disseminate respiratory infections. 6 Staphylococcus aureus is carried in the nasal mucosa in approximately 25% of the community 7, 8 and, may be self-inoculated, via face touching, by individuals who are frequently exposed to potential carriers in both the community and health care settings. 9, 10 During the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, face-touching behavior in the community was commonly observed with individuals touching their faces on average 3.3 times per hour. 11 In the health care setting, frequent face touching, particularly during periods of seasonal endemicity or outbreak, has the theoretical potential to be a mechanism of acquisition and transmission. 1 However, quantifying the role of face touching in the spread of respiratory infections or S aureus colonization is difficult for several reasons. First, such a study would require enrollment, screening, and prospective follow-up of a large population to identify a significant causal link. Second, the study would need to observe transmission occurring in community settings, rather than in isolation or under laboratory conditions, which would be ethically challenging. Finally, there are likely to be confounding factors, such as virulence of pathogens, varying susceptibility of the study population, and effects of modes of transmission other than hand to face contamination, that cannot easily be controlled.",

Ethical approval was obtained from the UNSW Human Research Ethics Committee prior to the commencement of the study. The student cohort had completed a one 4-hour infection control course in the previous 12 months. The infection control course included education on hand hygiene, aseptic technique, standard precautions, and transmission-based precautions. The same student cohort attended two 2-hour lectures unrelated to infection control, on 2 separate occasions. One week before the 2-hour lecture commenced, students were informed that a behavioral observation study was being conducted during the lecture and required the students to be videotaped while they listened to the lecture. Students were not informed about which behaviors were under observation to blind them from the aims of the study; this was necessary to minimize the potential for a change in behavior as a result of being observed. 13 To participate in the study, students were instructed to move to a marked area on the left side of the lecture theatre and complete a participant consent form. To opt out of the study, students were instructed to move to the right side of the lecture theatre outside of the videotape recording range. Students were also informed that they could withdraw from the study once recording commenced by simply moving to the other side of the theatre. All participants consented prior to videotape recording.",

This is particularly so during the symptomatic or asymptomatic prodromal stages of infections when patients shed infectious material. 16 In particular, clinicians caring for infectious pediatric patients with high shedding concentrations 17,18 may be at risk of acquiring an infection if they have a high level of facetouching behavior. 19 S aureus is a common pathogen prevalent in both community and health care settings. Colonization of the nasal mucous membranes with S aureus is common and ranges from 20%-30% in health care and community settings. 7 Nose touching was common among our participants. This finding supports the importance of hand hygiene as a means of preventing occupationally acquired colonization with S aureus from patients or the contaminated environment. 8, 10, 20, 21 S aureus can survive for up to 5 years on hard surfaces, and no obvious role has yet been attributed to colonized staff. 7 When mixed with hospital dust, S aureus can still survive for >1 year until it is picked up from the environment. 22, 23 Contaminated hands may act as a vector, transmitting the bacteria from a contaminated surface to the HCW's nasopharynx via face touching. High hand hygiene compliance before and after patient contact should reduce the likelihood of transferring pathogens through self-inoculation and in turn prevent inoculation of patients. 10, 24, 25 Pathogens found on stethoscopes have also been recovered from physician's hands. 26 Given the habitual face-touching behavior observed in our study, it is possible that the inoculation of stethoscopes and other contaminated medical equipment may have been the result of inoculation from nose touching to hands and subsequently to the stethoscope. Given the frequency of facetouching behavior observed in this study, clinicians must practice hand hygiene before and after using such equipment to ensure that patient equipment is kept clean prior to use.",

Models of infection transmission and comparison of transmission efficiency of self-inoculation against other transmission routes are required to further expand our knowledge on the role of face touching for self-inoculation. Meanwhile, raising awareness that face-touching behavior is common and is a possible vector in self-inoculation could result in HCWs accepting the message that hand hygiene before and after patient contact is an effective method of reducing colonization and infection transmission for themselves and their patients.",
