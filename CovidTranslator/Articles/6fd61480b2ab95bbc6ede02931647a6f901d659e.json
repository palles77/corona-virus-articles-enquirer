Virus-specific polymerase activity has been detected at both early and late times in the infectious cycle (4, 5). The polymerase detected at early times p.i. synthesizes RNA complementary to virion RNA, whereas the late appearing polymerase synthesizes subgenomic and genomic RNA of the same polarity as virion RNA (positive-strand RNA) (6).",

The study of the viral polymerase in intact cells is hampered by the small amount of polymerase present, and no proteins with polymerase activity have yet been isolated. To study the synthesis of the putative viral polymerase under more favorable conditions, we translated virion RNA in cell-free lysates from rabbit reticulocytes (1). We showed that the virion RNA is translated in vitro into several large peptides of molecular weight greater than 200,000, with a predominant product of 220,000 (~220) in agreement with other workers (7) and also identified a 28,000-Da protein which was the N-terminal portion of the larger precursor proteins. In the presence of protease inhibitors such as leupeptin, the synthesis of ~220 and p28 was diminished, and a new protein with mol wt 250,000 became evident.

To determine if either ~220 or p28 was present in infected tissue culture cells, we labeled cells with [35S] methionine and analyzed the products at different times after infection.

This suggested that p28 was a basic protein and presumably did not enter the IEF gel for this reason. p28 is not synthesized in the presence of leupeptin when analyzed by one-dimensional SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and, as expected, the p28 which we have identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was similarly not synthesized in the presence of this inhibitor.",
