            "text": "To date, two members of the EPAC family proteins have been identified, known as EPAC1 (coded by Rapgf3 gene, in human) and EPAC2 (coded by Rapgf4 gene, in human). 5, 6 EPAC1 (cAMP-GEF-I) is an about 100 kDa molecular weight multi-domain protein that is highly expressed in developing and mature human tissues. The multi-domain protein EPAC2 has three isoforms (EPAC2A, EPAC2B and EPAC2C) with about 115 kDa of molecular weight and is enriched in nervous system and endocrine tissues. EPAC1 and EPAC2 proteins have considerable similarity in the structure and sequence (68% similarity in human). 11 Both EPAC1 and EPAC2 consist of two regions, the N-terminal regulatory region and the Cterminal catalytic region. The regulatory region of EPAC protein includes a disheveled, Egl-10, pleckstrin (DEP) domain and cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD). The Cterminal catalytic regions of EPAC1 and EPAC2 are composed of three basic domains named as cell division cycle 25 homology GEF domain (CDC25-HD), Ras association (RA) domain, and Ras exchange motif (REM) domain. 12, 13 In the absence of cAMP, the activity of EPAC is auto-inhibited. The N-terminal regulatory region and the C-terminal catalytic region of EPAC are held together through intramolecular interactions, thereby preventing Rap binding to the CDC25-HD of EPAC and keeping EPAC inactive ( Figure 1 ). 14 When cell is stimulated by extracellular signals, ACs are activated through various ligands which bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and promote the conversion of ATP into cAMP. 15 The binding of cAMP to CNBD allows the regulatory region to rotate about 90\u00b0 sideways and leaves enough space for Rap binding to CDC25-HD. 15 Consequently, active EPAC catalyzes the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and controls Rap-mediated biological functions ( Figure 1 ). The EPAC signaling pathway plays a critical role in various biological responses including insulin secretion, neuronal function, cardiovascular function, vascular function, inflammation, cancer, pain, and infections. 1, [7] [8] [9] [10] The EPAC signaling pathway is involved in insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2 cells. EPAC2 promotes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by regulation of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration. [16] [17] [18] To date, three pathways have been revealed for EPAC2-mediated insulin secretion. First, EPAC2/Rap can activate phospholipase C\u03b5 (PLC\u03b5), protein kinase C (PKC), ryanodine receptor (RyR) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase (SERCA). 19, 20 Second, EPAC2 can directly interact with sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1), leading to ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K ATP ) closure in response to the increase in the ATP/ADP ratio, thus regulating the intracellular Ca 2+ level. 21 Third, interaction of EPAC2 with Rim2, Munc 13-1 and Piccolo potentiates rapid Ca 2+ -dependent exocytosis. 22, 23 According to a recent study, EPAC1 may also play an important role in GSIS. 24 The EPAC1 knockout mouse model showed the decreased expression of glucose transporter Glut2 and transcription factor PDX1. Collectively, these studies suggest that EPAC represents a potential therapeutic target for diabetes and obesity.",

EPAC1 is limited in nuclear signaling while EPAC2 is found to gather around the T tubules, indicating that EPAC2 is involved in the arrhythmogenic SR Ca 2+ leak. 37 EPAC also plays a critical role in the development of cardiac fibrosis. 38 The important involvement of EPAC in cardiovascular functions offers a new direction for the discovery of new treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

Besides, EPAC can induce vasorelaxation or vasoconstriction through distinct regulation of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration and K ATP . 39, 43, 44 In vivo studies reveal that knockout of the EPAC1 gene can attenuate neointima formation by inhibition of smooth muscle cells migration, in the meantime, Ca 2+ concentration and cofilin-mediated lamellipodia formation are decreased. 45 Most recently, Cheng and coworkers found that EPAC1 involved in neointima formation through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and mitochondrial fission in response to vascular injury in the mouse carotid artery ligation model. 46 Therefore, EPAC is a promise therapeutic target for vascular diseases. In addition, EPAC exhibits anti-inflammatory activity against interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor signaling through up-regulating the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in VECs. 47 Both in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that inhibition of EPAC led to the expression vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) decrease and mediated the effect of Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) activity. These findings indicate that EPAC-PDE4 signaling pathway may provide a novel means for the treatment of vascular inflammation inclusive of atherosclerosis and in-stent restenosis. 48 Moreover, recent hyperalgesia priming and EPAC knockout mouse model studies uncovered a key role of EPAC1 in chronic inflammatory pain under the control of EPAC1 phosphorylation mediated by GPCR kinase 2 (GRK2). 49, 50 It is worth to mention that EPAC is also associated with airway diseases via modulating airway smooth muscle cell functions.

Numerous papers support that EPAC1 promote various cancer cells (including cervical, 58 fibrosarcoma, 59 melanoma, 60 ovarian, 61 pancreatic 62 and prostate 63 ) migration and metastasis. The cAMP-mediated immune functions are well documented, but the breakthrough work on implication of EPAC in anti-cancer immunotherapy has not been reported until recently. EPAC1 was identified to play an essential role in the regulation of T-cell-mediated immunosuppression. 64 Interestingly, results from a recent study suggest that EPAC signaling pathway may up-regulate the aerobic glycolysis, and promote oncogenesis. 65 All these studies demonstrate EPAC1 is an emerging target for cancer therapy.",

A breakthrough on EPAC selective modulators was made by Bos and co-workers 27, 70 Through the comparison of the binding sites of compound 1 with EPAC and PKA cAMP domains, they found that the 2\u2032-OH group of the compound 1 could form hydrogen bond with highly conserved glutamate residue (Glu238 in human PKA protein) in the PKA cAMP domain, which is absent in the EPAC cAMP binding site (Figure 3) . Interaction between the 2\u2032-OH group and conserved glutamate residue is essential for cAMP binding to the PKA cAMP domain and modification of the 2\u2032-OH group could lead to selective EAPC modulators. Based on these findings, a series of 2\u2032-O-alkyl-modified analogues of compound 1, for example, compound 2 (2\u2032-O-Me-cAMP, Figure 2 ), were designed, and they exhibited about 10-to 100-fold EPAC/PKA selectivity. 27 It is worth to mention that replacing the 2\u2032-OH group by hydrogen led to compound 3 (2\u2032-deoxy-cAMP, Figure 2 ). 71 Compound 3 showed some EPAC/PKA selectivity, but with a dramatic loss of its EPAC activation activity compared to compound 1.",

Since the discovery of compound 4, it has been widely used as a powerful tool for elucidating the EPAC functions. [72] [73] [74] [75] In rat models, injection of compound 4 can provoke mechanical hyperalgesia through the mechanism of activating the \u03b5 isoform of PKC. 72 When 5-HT at the threshold and subthreshold concentrations, compound 4 remarkably increased the frequency of Ca 2+ oscillations. 73 Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) cultures, treated with compound 4, at a 100 \u03bcM level, decreased approximately 40% HIV-1 viral replication. 74 According to the most recent studies, compound 4 recapitulated the cocaineinduced increase in GluA2-lacking \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), indicating its therapeutic potential for drug additions. 75 Based on its aforementioned advantages, compound 4 has been widely employed as a useful chemical probe for EPAC function studies, but its biological application is limited due to its poor plasma membrane penetrating capability. Esterification of the negatively charged singly bonded oxygen of the compound 4 phosphate group led to compound 5 (8-pCPT-2\u2032-O-Me-cAMP-AM, a.k.a. 007-AM, Figure 2 ), which contains a mixture of the equatorial and the axial isomers. 76 Compound 5 works as a prodrug of 4, and can be hydrolyzed to release 4 quickly after crossing the plasma membrane. Compound 5 displays an effect of over 100fold more potent than compound 4 without affecting its EPAC/PKA selectivity, and it has greatly facilitated the studies of EPAC signaling pathways. 1, 12 However, it is a good substrate for phosphodiesterases (PDE) and also acts as a PDE inhibitor. 10 On the other hand, introducing a phenyl group to compound 1 at the N-6 position led to compound 6 (N 6 -phenyl-cAMP, Figure 2 ). 27 Biological studies suggest that compound 6 acts as a full PKA agonist instead of EPAC agonist. This finding indicates that modification on the N-6 position of compound 1 may lead to PKA/EPAC selective agonists.",

Three compounds from the NCI diversity set library were identified with IC 50 values range from 1.7 to 7.9 \u03bcM in competing with compound 9 in binding EPAC2. 84 Furthermore, they expanded their screening to the Maybridge Hitfinder compound library with about 14,400 compounds. 85 Seven compounds (compounds 10 to 16, Figure 4 ) were discovered to completely inhibit EPAC2 GEF activities at 25 \u03bcM in the presence of a same concentration of cAMP.",

Furthermore, it is involved in EPAC-mediated Rap1 activation, AKT phosphorylation, pancreatic beta cells insulin production and secretion. 1 Although previous work found that the levels of EPAC1 was overexpressed in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), the mechanism was unclear. 90 Cheng and coworkers 62 revealed that compound 14 inhibited EPAC1-mediated adhesion of AsPC-1 and PANC-1 cells without affecting cell proliferation and viability. Furthermore, in an orthotopic metastatic mouse model, with an injection dose of 10 mg/kg once daily for 3 weeks, compound 14 prevented local and distant MIA PaCa-2 cell spread and significantly reduced metastasis to the liver. 63 This result indicates that EPAC1 is a promising target for pancreatic cancer migration and invasion. Cronstein and co-workers 91 revealed that compound 14 completely blocked RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation at 10 \u03bcM, and it might diminish bone destruction in inflammatory arthritis. In vivo, compound 14 dose-dependently inhibited Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced mechanical hyperalgesia without influencing mechanical sensitivity of control mice, suggesting that compound 14 may be developed as a potential therapy for chronic pain. 50 The essential roles of cAMP-mediated signaling pathways in modulating leptin production/ secretin and regulating metabolic homeostasis were previously explored, and the importance of EPAC-cAMP pathway in leptin resistance has been recently discovered. 92 Further studies to investigate EPAC-cAMP pathway in obesity regulation were reported by Cheng and coworkers. 93, 94 Their investigation implies that EPAC inhibitor compound 14 can inhibit leptin production and secretion, in vitro and in vivo. These findings offer strong evidence that EPAC1 could act as a novel pharmacological target for diabetes and obesity therapies.",

Further, compound 23 was reported to exhibit modest selectivity on EPAC1 versus EPAC2, providing an EPAC1 selective inhibitor. 103 An early SAR study indicated that the substituents on the tetrahydroquinoline pharmacophore was requisite for the EPAC1 inhibitory activity. The stereochemistry also plays an important role in EPAC1 inhibitory activity, and its (R)-enantiomer (24) was found to be 10-fold more potent than its (S)-enantiomer (25) in EPAC1 GEF inhibition in vitro. In addition, compound 24 exhibits 10-fold selectivity for EPAC1 versus EPAC2. Compound 24 may serve as a useful chemical probe for elucidating biological functions of EPAC1, while more relevant studies are needed to further validate its target-specificity and therapeutic potential.",

Although compound 4 and its prodrug have been useful as pharmacological tools for probing cAMP-mediated signaling, the big challenge is that it exhibits cross-target activities and off-target effects.

            "text": "Another milestone in the field is the de novo discovery of EPAC2 and EPAC1 specific inhibitors through fluorescence-based HTS assays. Due to the excellent EPAC/PKA selectivity of compound 14, it has been widely applied as a useful chemical probe to discriminate EPAC related signaling pathways and biological functions. In addition, compound 14 and its analogs exert excellent in vivo PK and toxicity profiles and are promising lead compounds for therapeutic applications. Nevertheless, more extensive chemical optimizations are imperative to improve the potency (ideally submicromolar to nanomolar IC 50 ) and the isoform-selectivity (EPAC1 vs. EPAC2) of this class of EPAC inhibitors. Therefore, EPAC-isoform specific agonists or antagonists with high potency and selectivity are still in urgent need, and to this end, modern drug discovery approaches (e.g. HTS, fragment-based drug discovery [104] [105] [106] and computer-aided drug design 107 may pave the way. Of note, EPAC1 and EPAC2 may play significant and distinct biological roles in a variety of human diseases, especially in cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, CNS disorders (e.g. drug addiction, and pain), infections and diabetes. Hence, potent EPAC agonists or antagonists with high EPAC1 or EPAC2-isoform selectivity, as well as ideal pharmacokinetic profiles are highly appreciated for further clinical development towards a viable therapeutic strategy for various human diseases. Postulated mechanisms of EPAC activation and associated biological functions. Under the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) stimulation, adenylate cyclases (ACs) convert adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The excessive cAMP can be degraded into 5\u2032-AMP by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The binding of cAMP to inactive EPAC leads to the activation of EPAC, which facilitates the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and controls Rap-mediated biological functions. Meanwhile, Rap-GTPase-activating proteins (Rap-Gap) facilitate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rap to breakdown GTP into GDP and phosphorus inorganic (Pi).",
