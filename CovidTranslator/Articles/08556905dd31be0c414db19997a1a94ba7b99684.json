The purpose of this study is, after an exhaustive literature review and necessary interviews with specialists in this field, to propose a research framework that explores the factors that affect the ICPs' willingness to adopt knowledge management (KM) into their tasks and to validate the usefulness of this research framework through a survey study. The research framework includes four constructs that affect infection control professionals' decision and willingness to introduce and to adopt infection control KM, and they are namely: hospital characteristics, infection control department, external environment, and project planning. The study conducted a survey among ICPs from 425 hospitals in Taiwan. A total of 227 valid questionnaire responses were returned from the ICPs from 90 hospitals. Among these responses, 55.00% are from medical centers and 47.83% are from regional hospitals. After analyzing the responses through the discriminant analysis method, the study found that ''Hospital Resource Support,\" ''Colleagues' Attitude,\" and ''Users' Participation\" are the three factors that significantly impact the professionals' willingness for adopting KM in infection control departments. This study not only provides the healthcare industry an understanding about introduction and impact of KM, which can assist in their decision making, but also emphasizes the importance of use of actual data in the study of research framework for introduction of KM in healthcare industry. Therefore, this study presents important results in both practical and academic aspects.",

After that, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was first noticed in Vietnam in the February of 2003, and, by the end of that year, 29 countries were under the threat of SARS with a total amount of 8096 suspected cases and 774 deaths (cumulated from 1 November 2002 to 31 July 2003) (WHO, 2009a) . Unfortunately, a new influenza virus, H1N1 (referred to as ''swine flu\" early on), is now spreading all over the world. Up to 23 May 2009, 43 countries have officially reported 12,022 cases of H1N1 infection. Mexico has re-ported 3892 cases of infection, including 75 deaths (WHO, 2009b) . Within few years, human beings faced three new kinds of highly-infectious and lethal diseases, which made the whole world pay more attention to disease prevention and infection control. Infection control is deemed as one of the important tasks which should be fulfilled in the 21st century (Hsueh & Yang's report, 2003) .",

The Taiwanese government pays much attention on the effects of infection control. For example, it is known from the Medical Care Act that Taiwan's government has stipulated that hospitals should take the responsibility for infection control, and the performance of which weighs heavily in the hospital accreditation. In practices, hospitals are asked to offer a lot of disease prevention measure, keep an eye on the epidemiological study, and establish an infectious disease reporting system. And the infection control department is deservedly taken as the communicating channel with the stakeholders; the department, hence, covers the disease preven-tion at not only the hospital, but also its neighboring community. But, this trend has caused an increase in workload for infection control department.",

Whether an organization can offer sufficient capital, manpower, and time is said to be crucial for enterprise systems development (Grover & Goslar, 1993; Tait & Vessey, 1998) . That is, top management support of resources allocation for systems development is very important. It can be seen in terms of the following indicators: executives' understanding in an information system's advantages, executives' assistance and related resources allocation, executives' encouragement to colleagues for IT use, executives' efforts in overcoming any resistance, executives' involvement in decision-making of the project and their degree of satisfaction to users' participation (Haley, 1997; Premkumar & Robert, 1999; Yap, Thong, & Raman, 1994) . Meanwhile, Ein-Dor and Segev (1978) note that the development and implementation of the system will be constrained not only by internal factors (e.g. time and capital) but by external ones (e.g. manpower training and software/hardware).",

Gardner (1999) also indicates that leading is a process of lobbying or exemplifying, from which the group members will be invigorated to pursue the goal set by the leader or shared by them all. Gatignon and Robertson (1989) examined factors affecting an organization to adopt new IT and found that the way decisionmakers deal with the information is one of the main factors. Leaders push their followers by persuasion and power, and they create an environment for followers to work more efficiently. Through executives' leading, colleagues' latent capabilities are triggered, their work efficiency are raised, personal needs of every member are satisfied, the hospital's effectiveness is enhanced, and the hospital's goal is accomplished.",

Tait and Vessey (1998) suggest that user system, technical system, and development process variables should also be taken into account in assessing the effect of user involvement on system success. Similarly, Lawrence and Low (1993) argue that the group formed by users should guarantee that they should actively join the process of developing the system, understanding the system objectives, receiving enough training, and providing sufficient technology documents. According to Hartwick and Barki (1994) , the most important evaluation indicators for user participation are: taking the responsibility throughout the development, the correlation between users and the information system, and personally joining the activity design.

Eeekin, Helms, and Haynes (1990) argue that colleagues' trust in the project or technology that executives promote is conducive to smooth implementation. As well, it is mentioned by Haley (1997) that full resource integration helps prevent unnecessary obstacles. The introduction of sufficient manpower and capital into the project will make it run more smoothly. Contrast to general computerization activities, however, the adoption of KM system covers the establishment of an innovative management mechanism and the implementation of advanced software/hardware-similar to so-called ''Technology and support infrastructure\" component of Guptill (2005) 's framework for applying knowledge management to healthcare. That is to say, for a hospital to make a success IT, it has to not only invest considerable capital and time, but also hold top-management's attitudes toward the promotion of the project. Therefore, compared to Hospital Culture and Hospital Scale, ''Hospital Resource Support\" is seen as a more significant factor influencing infection control department personnel' willingness to adopt KM. In other words, the success in adopting ICKM lies in hospital managerial personnel's willingness to invest sufficient resources; this argument is supported by this study.",

In addition, hospitals of different levels possess different amount of available resources, and a hospital and its infection control department may hold different attitudes to the introduction of ICKM. Therefore, it is suggested that hospitals make early planning, properly allocate available resources, and encourage and nurture staff who are experienced in ICKM. Meanwhile, as a trend, despite having long been applied by other industries, KM per se and its combination with IT are still new concepts in the healthcare industry, and medical colleagues' understanding in them is limited. Hence, it is suggested that more ICKM-related instruction and on-the-spot visits should be provided, and executives and ICPs should be encouraged to take part in these activities in an attempt to enrich their knowledge in ICKM. As consequence, executives' and colleagues' willingness to adopt ICKM will be raised, and they would actively join the project planning, too. Additionally, if we want to retain and spread colleagues' ICKM-related experiences and knowledge, the incorporation of IT is inevitable. Thus, it is suggested that hospitals integrate current resources, make more effective use of existing knowledge, and classify and preserve the existing knowledge in an effort to set up an adequate KM mechanism.
