            "text": "Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses pose a debilitating pandemic threat. Thus, understanding mechanisms of antibody-mediated viral inhibition and neutralization escape is critical. Here, a robust yeast display system for fine epitope mapping of viral surface hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibodies is demonstrated. The full-length H5 subtype HA (HA0) was expressed on the yeast surface in a correctly folded conformation, determined by binding of a panel of extensively characterized neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). These mAbs target conformationally-dependent epitopes of influenza A HA, which are highly conserved across H5 clades and group 1 serotypes. By separately displaying HA1 and HA2 subunits on yeast, domain mapping of two anti-H5 mAbs, NR2728 and H5-2A, localized their epitopes to HA1. These anti-H5 mAb epitopes were further fine mapped by using a library of yeast-displayed HA1 mutants and selecting for loss of binding without prior knowledge of potential contact residues. By overlaying key mutant residues that impacted binding onto a crystal structure of HA, the NR2728 mAb was found to interact with a fully surface-exposed contiguous patch of residues at the receptor binding site (RBS), giving insight into the mechanism underlying its potent inhibition of virus binding. The non-neutralizing H5-2A mAb was similarly mapped to a highly conserved H5 strain-specific but poorly accessible location on a loop at the trimer HA interface. These data further augment our toolchest for studying HA antigenicity, epitope diversity and accessibility in response to natural and experimental influenza infection and vaccines.",

Humoral immunity is the mainstay of protection during the course of influenza virus infection. Antibodies also provide a major contribution to vaccine-induced protection against influenza through multiple mechanisms [2] . The ability to map the putative binding sites of virus-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can improve our understanding of anti-viral immunity by providing precise insight into the variable or conserved nature of their epitopes, as well as their neutralization activity and neutralization escape potential. Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is the major viral surface glycoprotein that mediates binding and entry of the virus to host cells and is a primary target of neutralizing antibody responses [2] . HA-specific antibodies can inhibit infection by blocking viral attachment to sialic acid residues of surface proteins on host cells, interfering with the structural transition of HA that triggers fusion activity in the endosome, or by simultaneous inhibition of attachment and virus-cell fusion [3] . Precise mapping of the HA epitopes targeted by neutralizing mAbs can define the structural requirements for protective anti-viral function and shed light on the mechanisms of antigenic drift in HA [2] .",

A strategy that can be implemented without prior knowledge of binding sites or the binding stoichiometry of these antibodies would be highly valuable. Recently, yeast has been shown to be a simple and feasible platform for display of various surface proteins for engineering and library screening applications [4] . Yeast can be easily grown on a large scale with simple nutritional demands and offers the advantage of providing eukaryotic post-translational modifications lacking in bacterial phage display [4, 5] . It has also proven possible on yeast to identify both linear and conformational antibody epitopes of complex proteins and to map them down to the energetically important amino acid residues [4, 6, 7] .",

Domain mapping using separately displayed HA1 and HA2 subunits located the unknown epitopes of two anti-H5 mAbs (NR2728 and H5-2A) on HA1. This system was further used to fine epitope map these two anti-H5 mAbs by screening a random mutagenesis library of HA1 mutants by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Clones with selective loss of binding to one of the two tested anti-HA mAbs were isolated and analyzed to identify specific residues that negatively impacted binding. When analyzed in the context of the HA crystal structure, clustering of amino acids led to the identification of the mAb epitopes.",

            "text": "In order to use this yeast system for future influenza antibody studies, it was important to demonstrate its broad capability for fine mapping HA-specific antibodies. Therefore, low rate mutagenesis by an error-prone PCR method was used to generate a mutant HA1 gene library of about 2 \u00c2 10 5 clones as determined by plating serial dilutions of the transformed yeast cells. The H5-2A and NR2728 mAbs were further characterized in these fine mapping studies. The library was screened by two rounds of FACS to select yeast clones with selective loss of binding to H5-2A or NR2728 but that retained surface expression of HA and binding to other HA-specific antibodies. Fifty individual clones isolated by sorting were sequenced and evaluated to identify the binding epitope on the HA protein. Multiple mutants containing a single amino acid alteration in HA1 were identified by DNA sequencing, and several of these mutations conferred considerable and selective loss of binding to one of the two anti-HA mAbs. Five mutations (T206, N210, Q211, R212 and K238) abolished binding of the H5-2A mAb, while binding of anti-cMyc and NR2728 were unchanged (Fig. 4A top) . The binding epitope of H5-2A was mapped to a conserved loop on HA1, which is distant from the receptor binding sites. The sequence of the H5-2A epitope located in the loop of HA1 was highly H5-strain specific and not found in any other subtypes among the total of 10,815 unique HA sequences available in a public influenza database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ FLU/FLU.html) as of Feb. 24, 2011 (Sup. Table 1 ). Five of the HA mutations (S125, H129, Y161, I164 and R166) caused total loss of NR2728 binding, while binding of H5-2A as well as anti-cMyc were unchanged (Fig. 4A bottom) . In the competitive binding assay, unlabeled H5-2A did not cross-compete with labeled NR2728 (Alexa Flour 647) but did self-compete with labeled H5-2A (Alexa Flour 647) for binding to the HA1 subunit (Fig. 4C) . Analysis of the location of mutations in the selected clones indicated that NR2728 binds to HA1 at an interface overlapping with the receptor binding site by forming a contiguous patch on the solvent-exposed surface of the receptor binding site, whereas H5-2A binds to a loop on HA1 away from the receptor binding site (RBS) (Fig. 4B, left and middle) . Within the trimeric HA crystal structure, the NR2728 epitope is fully exposed, while the H5-2A epitope is cryptic at the interface of the HA monomers (Fig. 4B, right) . The results of both the competitive binding assay (Fig. 4C ) and the mapping of the loss-ofbinding mutations (Fig. 4B ) indicated that these two mAbs had non-identical/non-overlapping epitopes (Fig. 4B) . The binding epitopes on HA for H5-2A and NR2728 were also tested for function- Fig. 2 . FACS analysis of anti-HA mAbs binding to yeast surface-displayed HA0. (A) HA0 is bound by conformationally sensitive mAbs that target the highly conserved stem region of HA, which mediates viral membrane fusion with host cells. The 11A and 80R mAbs were used as negative controls. (B) The F10 mAb was shown to be conformationally sensitive by loss of binding to heat-denatured HA on yeast. ality in a HI assay. In contrast to H5-2A which did not inhibit the agglutination of turkey RBCs mediated by the influenza strain H5N1, NR2728 showed strong inhibitory activity in this assay (Fig. 4D ). Of note, the potently neutralizing F10 mAb which targets the HA stem region had virtually no activity in the HI assay (Fig. 4D) , which is consistent with our previous work showing that this antibody inhibits influenza by a mechanism other than blocking virus binding to host cells [3] . Taken together, these results suggest that the specific interaction of NR2728 with the HA RBS resulted in its potent inhibition of virus attachment to sialic acid receptors.",

In this study, the fulllength extracellular HA0 protein and HA1 and HA2 subunits were cloned into a yeast surface expression vector (Fig. 1A) . These constructs produced recombinant HA proteins that were effectively displayed at high levels ( Fig. 1A and B) . The expression of surface-displayed HA proteins and their corresponding sizes were fur-ther confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1C) . Notably, the yeast surface-expressed HA variants reacted properly with anti-HA mAbs that recognize linear or conformation-dependent epitopes, suggesting that the proteins were processed through the secretory pathway with intact antigenic determinants and conformational integrity (Figs. 2 and 3 ). In particular, the proper conformation of the yeast-displayed HA0 protein was demonstrated by binding of a panel of eight broadly neutralizing antibodies against antigenically diverse influenza A Group 1 subtypes, including H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13 and H16 [3] .",

            "text": "To determine whether the displayed HA proteins could be used to define critical residues for anti-HA mAb recognition, the H5-2A and NR2728 mAbs were mapped using an error-prone PCR-derived library of H5 HA1 on the surface of yeast. The yeast clones were screened for selective loss of binding to the specific mAb but retention of binding to both the cMyc tag and other H5-specific antibodies. The H5-2A mAb epitope is located mainly on a single loop that is buried in the HA1 trimer interface, away from the receptor binding site and its surrounding hypervariable dominant loops (Fig. 4B) . This location and its putative cryptic location within the HA trimer may result in the epitope being placed under weak evolutionary selection pressure for immune escape, hence resulting in a relatively conserved sequence among the H5 strains. In fact, 80% of the H5 sequences (1895/2374) aligned with the H5-2A epitope ''TSTLNQR'', and 99% of these (1881/1895) contained the exact binding sequence (Sup. Table 2 ). Although the H5-2A mAb lacked neutralizing activity ( [3] and unpublished data) or agglutination of erythrocytes in the HI assay (Fig. 4D) , the H5-2A mAb may have diagnostic value due to its conserved and serotype-specific epitope. The NR2728-binding epitope spans a larger surface area that overlaps with the RBS on HA. The critical residues of the NR2728-specific epitope are located in two distinct turns where the residues are surface-accessible and contiguous to the receptor binding residues. Thus, this epitope mapping information corroborates the observation that NR2728 can strongly inhibit virus binding to cells in our HI assay (Fig. 4D ) and is consistent with its previously determined viral neutralization activity [12] . NR2728 and H5-2A both retained binding to denatured HA, suggesting that they may both recognize linear or continuous epi- topes. However, the findings of involvement of discontinuous amino acids for both mAbs also leave open the possibility of a more complex epitope that shows partial resistance to denaturation/ renaturation under the experimental conditions used here.",

            "text": "In summary, our results demonstrate that yeast is a viable host for expression of HA proteins in correctly folded conformational forms and can be utilized for domain mapping and fine epitope mapping of residues in contact with neutralizing anti-HA mAbs. The recent influenza pandemic of 2009 highlighted the need to have better tools for quickly identifying viral targets for prophylactic vaccines and generating passive therapeutic antibody candidates against multiple subtypes of influenza A virus. Thus, HA-specific mAb epitope mapping can be used to identify the location of neutralizing epitopes which can further corroborate the structural characteristics of the epitope as well as mechanisms of mAbs-mediated virus neutralization and neutralization escape. In addition, it is conceivable that the standard serological method used to subtype the HA of newly isolated influenza A viruses using polyclonal anti-HA sera could be replaced with a panel of subtypespecific mAbs similar to H5-2A. The detailed epitope mapping of anti-HA antibodies presented here could potentially aid in efforts to better understand antibody epitopes of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus or other emerging influenza strains as we remain on guard for the next influenza pandemic.
