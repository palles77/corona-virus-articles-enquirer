The majority of CD4 + T lymphocytes entering the virus-infected CNS in the course of the infection are primed cells that neither proliferate ex vivo nor can be stimulated to proliferation by viral antigens or mitogen in vitro. In contrast, T lymphocytes taken from CLNs of the same animals revealed a strong proliferative response. Restimulation of CLN lymphocytes by viral antigens disclosed a striking difference between the disease-resistant rat strain Brown Norway (BN) and the susceptible Lewis (LEW) strain. Whereas BN lymphocytes responded as early as 5 days post infection, it took more than 11 days until a comparable proliferation was detectable in LEW lymphocytes. From these data we postulate that the majority of T lymphocytes entering the virus-infected brain after sensitisation and expansion in cervical lymph nodes is unresponsive to further proliferation signals and that the kinetics and magnitude of T lymphocyte stimulation in CLNs play an important role in the clinical course of the infection.",

            "text": "The unaffected central nervous system (CNS) is an immunologically sequestered organ. This is evidenced by low expression of MHC antigens on very few meningeal and perivascular cells, the lack of immunostimulatory dendritic ceils, absence of draining lymphatic vessels and a tight blood-brain barrier that prevents extensive lymphoid cell traffic (Wekerle et al., 1986; . The immunologically privileged state is rapidly changed when the CNS becomes a target for viral infections. Inflammatory infiltrates in the CNS tissue clearly indicate the engagement of the immune system, but to date neither the afferent nor the efferent arm of a CNS-localised virus-specific immune response are completely understood. In particular, the upregulation of MHC class II antigens in the inflamed virus-infected CNS raises many questions with respect to infiltrating CD4 \u00f7 T lymphocytes. It has been shown in vitro that expression of MHC class II antigens can be induced by y-interferon on CNS-resident glia cells (Wong et al., 1985) . Microglia cells have been identified as the major cell type expressing class II antigens in the CNS (Matsumoto et al., 1986; Hayes et al., 1987) and perivascular microglia cells can function as antigen-presenting cells for CD4 \u00f7 T lymphocytes (Hickey and Kimura, 1988) . Hence, microglia cells might support expansion and differentiation of immunoregulatory important CD4 \u00f7 T lymphocytes inside the CNS.",

            "text": "A suitable animal model to study these questions in vivo is the intracerebral infection of rats with the murine coronavirus strain JHM (JHMV). Dependent on the age and the genetic background of the animals different clinical courses have been reported (Watanabe et al., 1987; . Whereas in 3-week-old BN rats the infection remains subclinical, LEW rats infected at the same age die either from an acute encephalitis within 5-6 days or suffer from a subacute monophasic disease, characterised by ataxic gait, hind leg paresis or tetraplegia. The neurological disease in LEW rats is accompanied by a strong inflammatory response, dominated by CD4 +, a//3 T cell antigen receptor (TCR) + T lymphocytes, CD8 +, a//3 TCR + T lymphocytes and ED 1 + macrophages, all of which home to virus-infected areas in the CNS (D6rries et al., 1991) . Healthy BN rats recruit similar lymphocyte subsets into the CNS but usually fewer than in LEW rats (D6rries et al., 1991) . Concomitant with the increase of lymphoid cells in the brain parenchyma of JHMV-infected rats, MHC class II antigen expression is upregulated on CNS-resident microglia cells and peripheral MHC class II + cells pass the blood-brain barrier . In this context, presence of viral antigens might allow antigen-driven proliferation of CD4 + T lymphocytes resulting in intracerebral increase of this lymphocyte subset. We addressed this question by examination of T lymphocytes from the CNS and CLNs of JHMV-infected BN and LEW rats at different times post infection. Here, we demonstrate that T lymphocytes from CLNs but not from CNS of JHMV-infected BN and LEW rats proliferate ex vivo and can be stimulated to proliferate by JHMV-antigens in vitro. This suggests that priming and clonal expansion of virus-specific T lymphocytes during JHMV-induced encephalitis occur in CLNs and that increase of this lymphocyte population in the brain parenchyma reflects accumulation rather than local expansion of virus-specific T lymphocyte clones.",

Ex vivo proliferation of T lymphocytes was assessed after 48 h of culture at 37\u00b0C (5% CO2), by adding 14.8 kBq of [3H]thymidine (specific activity 1.59 TBq/mMol) per well for another 24 h. Incorporated radioactivity was determined by harvesting the lymphocytes on glass fiber filters, lysing of cells by hypotonic wash and subsequent count of radioactive decays in a B-plate counter. Mean values were calculated and plotted versus the time post infection. The same assay protocol was used to determine antigen-or mitogen-inducible proliferation.

Consequently, CNS-isolated T lymphocytes were cultured in the presence of inactivated JHM virus. Stimulation of cell proliferation was monitored by the addition of [3H]thymidine between 48 and 72 h of culture. Surprisingly, neither T cells from BN nor from LEW brain disclosed a proliferative JHMV-specific response (Fig. 4) .

Therefore, we assayed CLN lymphocytes taken from the same animals as for isolation of lymphocytes from the CNS. In contrast to brain-extracted lymphocytes, a clear dose-response curve was detected when the proliferation signal was examined in relation to the seeded cell density, giving the best signal at 1.0 X 107 cells/ml (Fig. 5 ). This result reflects the fact that in lymphoid tissue the majority of cells consists of naive recirculating cells, whereas in tissue primed and activated lymphoid cells are preferentially accumulated. Thus, it needs much more lymphocytes from second/~ry lymphoid tissue to obtain an amount of primed and activated cells comparable to tissue-infiltrating leukocytes.",

Most remarkable, LEW rats revealed a later but stronger proliferation compared to BN rats. The highest [3H]thymidine incorporation rates in LEW rats were detected at a time when the neurological disease was already fully developed (Fig. 6, upper panel; and Fig. 1) . In contrast, the maximal response of BN rats was seen shortly before the first clinical signs of the infection were detectable in LEW rats (Fig. 6, lower panel; and Fig.  1 ). These findings suggest that BN rats probably reacted earlier to the viral challenge compared to LEW rats. To verify this assumption, CLN cells were stimulated by the same viral antigen batch used for T lymphocytes extracted from the CNS. The results of this assay in Fig. 6 support our hypothesis. CLN cells from BN rats could be stimulated to strong virusspecific proliferation already at day 5 post infection. At this time the response of CLN lymphocytes from LEW rats was significantly lower. It took 6-7 additional days until CLN cells responded in these rats as detectable in BN rats. Nevertheless, in contrast to CLN cells from BN rats, enhancement of proliferation above the level observed in ex vivo assayed CLN cells was only marginal after restimulation with JHMV. Moreover, lymphocytes from BN rats revealed a second peak of JHMV- specific proliferation concomitantly with the observed increase of [3H]thymidine incorporation in LEW rats. This indicates that in JHMV-infected LEW rats the proliferative response of CLN cells is vigorous, but slower and less specific compared to BN rats.",

This is strongly supported by studies that demonstrate the capacity of microglia cells to induce a proliferative response of antigen-specific CD4 + T lymphocytes in vitro (Frei et al., 1987; Matsumoto et al., 1992; Williams et al., 1992) . However, the data presented here do not corroborate a stimulating influence of activated microglia on proliferation of brain-infiltrating T lymphocytes in vivo. We have previously documented upregulation of MHC class II antigens on brain-resident microglia cells of rats infected intracerebrally with the murine coronavirus strain JHM (Sedgwick and D~Srries, 1991; as well as presence of JHM virus antigen in the CNS for at least 3 weeks post infection . Additionally, as shown in this paper, CD4 + T cells infiltrating into the CNS of these animals are of primed or memory phenotype by virtue of a low expression of CD45RC. Nevertheless, we were unable to demonstrate a proliferative response of CNS-isolated T lymphocytes ex vivo. Concurring with this result is the fact that after a week post infection less than 5% of CNS-recoverable CD4 + T cells expressed the IL-2R. Both low expression of CD45RC and IL-2R are not confined to CD4 \u00f7 T lymphocytes from virus-infected rat brain. As shown by McCombe et al. (1992) , the majority of T lymphocytes that can be detected in spinal cord of rats suffering from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is of the same phenotype. This suggests that the CD4 + T lymphocyte population infiltrating the brain in the course of acute inflammatory CNS disorders is generally dominated by primed and already differentiated cells.",

In this context, our failure to restimulate these cells in vitro with viral antigens was surprising. For an explanation of this phenomenon at least two aspects have to be discussed: (i) Viability of cells could be impaired by the extraction procedure. Beside the fact that we recover roughly 80% of viable cells from a Percoll gradient when we mix viable spleen cells into the CNS extraction procedure (unpublished observation), cell counts for proliferation assays are expressed as viable cells by Trypan blue exclusion immediately before stimulation experiments. Nevertheless, in view of recent data from the EAE rat model (Schmied et al., 1993) we cannot rule out that a certain percentage of cells is apoptotic. Indeed, we have observed in preliminary experiments by FACS analysis, that up to 40% of CNS extracted cells can show DNA fragmentation without being necessarily recognised as dying cell by Trypan blue exclusion (unpublished observation). In any case, 60% of living cells should be enough cells to give a proliferative response. (ii) As hypothesised by Cross et al. (1991) , only a minority of CNS-infiltrating T cells may be antigen-specific in au-toimmune EAE. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that this could also be the case in virus-induced encephalomyelitis, absence of a dose-response relationship between amount of CNS-extracted T cells and virus-specific proliferation argues against it. Since attempts to induce proliferation by ConA were also unsuccessful, we believe indeed that the majority of CD4 \u00f7 T lymphocytes entering the virus-infected brain is unresponsive to further proliferation signals that probably could be given by MHC class II expressing brain-resident cells.",

However, careful evaluation of these investigations reveals that CNS-extracted leukocytes were assayed only on a single day post infection (day 5) and that compared to unstimulated cells the inducible proliferative response was marginal (2-fold enhancement). In this context, it is most remarkable that we also observed a slight (2-fold) enhancement of virus-inducible proliferation in CNS-extracted leukocytes of LEW and BN rats 4 dpi (Fig. 4) . However, this very low and statistically doubtful induction of proliferation is the only exemption from the rule of proliferative unresponsiveness within 14 dpi. Probably, a transient increased permissiveness of the blood-brain barrier as observed by us in rats early post intracerebral JHMV infection (D6rries et al., 1986 ) opens a small window allowing a few activated but not fully differentiated T cells to gain access to the brain parenchyma, where they can be detected for a very limited time as a small T cell population reactive to proliferation-inducing signals.",

(1992) used the bromodeoxyuridine labelling technique to demonstrate in situ that the majority of T lymphocytes in the CNS of LEW rats suffering from EAE do not proliferate. Moreover, proliferating T lymphocytes that were transferred from EAE animals to healthy syngeneic hosts stopped proliferation after entry into the CNS. Recent in vitro data from Matsumoto et al. (1992) suggest that astrocytes probably exhibit inhibitory functions on T lymphocyte proliferation, comparable to alveolar macrophages that probably suppress a proliferative response of non-recirculating T lymphocytes in the lung (Holt, 1986) .",

            "text": "In line with these observations, our data add more support to the idea that inside a target organ of lymphoid infiltration priming and expansion of CD4 \u00f7 T lymphocytes is rare. Under these circumstances the absence of a lymphoid drainage system in the CNS raises the question for the peripheral sites that will allow priming and expansion of CD4 + T lymphocytes that subsequently will enter the CNS. Data published by Harling-Berg et al. (1989) , Doherty et al. (1990) and Cserr and Knopf (1992) show that CLNs are the most important secondary lymphoid organ collecting antigens applied to the brain. Most likely, these antigens will leak with cerebrospinal fluid through the cribriform plate where olfactorial nerves cross the bloodbrain barrier and leave the base of the skull to penetrate the mucosa of the nose. From there lymphatic drainage will take antigens to CLNs where priming and differentiation of antigen-specific lymphocytes occur. Our data from CLNs of JHMV-infected rats are consistent with this hypothesis. T lymphocytes extracted from CLNs of animals that were taken to isolate lymphocytes from the CNS do proliferate ex vivo and can be stimulated to JHMV-specific proliferation in vitro. Since the dynamics of this CLN response reveal distinct maxima that precede onset as well as recovery from neurological disease, it seems very likely that the clinical course of the infection is closely related to the sensitisation event. These relationships are further substantiated by differences between LEW and BN rats with respect to the JHMV-specific in vitro response of CLN lymphocytes. Whereas in BN rats a strong proliferative response can be provoked by viral antigens early post infection, in LEW rats at the same time only minor virus-specific proliferation was inducible in vitro. It is of note, however, that minor in vitro induction of virus-specific proliferation in CLN cells from LEW rats is not due to a general incapability of these cells to proliferate. It seems rather the strong ex vivo proliferation of CLN cells from JHMV-infected LEW rats that prevents further enhancement of proliferation by exposure to viral antigens. Thus, it is likely that in contrast to BN rats the T cell compartment of LEW rats responds less specific with a long-lasting broad polyclonal proliferation to the viral challenge.",

            "text": "As we have reported previously (D6rries et al., 1991) in infected but healthy BN rats, viral spread in the CNS is limited to few and small periventricular sites. In contrast, large virus-infected areas spread through the CNS of LEW rats, including brain stem, cerebellum and spinal cord. Most likely, restricted viral spread in the BN rat is associated with the humoral immune response because virus-specific antibody-secreting plasma cells rapidly increase in the brain parenchyma post infection, whereas LEW rats show a considerable delay in the appearance of such cells in the CNS . Additionally, more of these plasma cells can be recovered from the infected BN brain and their capacity to secrete virus-specific antibodies as determined on a single-cell basis is much higher compared to LEW rats. These differences result in a rapid accumulation of virus-specific neutralising antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of BN rats . Differentiation of B lymphocytes into antibody-secreting plasma cells is highly dependent on the help from interleukins provided by T lymphocytes expressing the CD4, a//3 T cell antigen receptor (a//3 TCR) phenotype. Hence, the observed differences between BN and LEW rats with respect to kinetics, magnitude and quality of virus-specific antibody responses in the CNS could possibly be explained by the more rapid and specific sensitisation of the CD4 +, a//3 TCR + T lymphocyte fraction in CLNs of BN rats. However, since there is no simple quantitative relationship between local virus-specific antibody response and CNS-invading CD4 +, a//3 TCR + T lymphocytes, this hypothesis remains to be clarified on a qualitative basis.",

Speed and intensity of T cell sensitisation in these organs are most likely of major importance for the clinical outcome of the infection. Primed T lymphocytes enter the CNS and acquire a state of unresponsiveness to antigen-or mitogen-induced proliferation by a yet unknown regulatory event. Of course, this silent state with respect to proliferation does not necessarily exclude secretion of cytokines by these cells. Preliminary, so far unpublished investigations of cytokine-specific mRNA expression performed in our laboratory by RT PCR on CNS extracted leukocytes revealed a strong interferon-y response in the CNS of both LEW and BN rats. Thus, future examinations of functional properties of CNS-infiltrating CD4 + T cells especially with respect to interleukin secretion and to consequences of their possible interaction with upregulated MHC class II molecules on CNS-resident cells will further elucidate their important role as effector cells in virus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis.",
