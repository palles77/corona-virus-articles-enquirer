            "text": "Aqueous phase organic synthesis has attracted the attention of chemists as it overcomes the harmful effects associated with the organic solvents and is environmentally benign. These reactions become more sophisticated if they can be performed under supramolecular catalysis. In view of the above, the development of a generally applicable and environmentally benign methodology for the synthesis of 3-indolyl-3-hydroxy oxindoles and 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones derivatives is highly desirable. We report, herein, an aqueous phase synthesis of 3-indolyl-3-hydroxy oxindoles and 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones from isatins and indoles in the presence of sulfonated-b-cyclodextrin (b-CD-SO 3 H) ( Fig. 1 and Scheme 1). Supramolecular catalysis is a discipline in chemistry which involves intermolecular interactions where covalent bonds are not established between the interacting species which can be molecules, ions or radicals. 17 The most accessible b-cyclodextrin (b-CD) is a cyclic oligosaccharide consisting of seven glucose units. The cavity size and the inner hydrophobicity are suitable for encapsulating a variety of guests such as aromatic compounds. 18 The improvement of the reaction rate and selectivity with b-CD inclusion complexes has been reported in a number of organic reactions. 19 b-cyclodextrin mediated reactions in water are very useful tool for economic as well as environmental points of view. 20, 21 Sulfonated-b-cyclodextrin shows good results over bcyclodextrin in the synthesis of 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)one 22 In continuation of our work on b-CD, 24 we envisioned b-CD-SO 3 H as a supramolecular catalyst and study its application on the synthesis of 3-substituted 3-hydroxyoxindoles and 3,3di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones to develop a simple and efficient method in aqueous media.",

Encouraged by the initial success, we applied the optimal protocol to a variety of isatins and indoles (Table 5) .

The reaction proceeds in the absence of b-CD-SO 3 H to give less yield (60%). The best result was obtained for 10 mmol % of b-CD-SO 3 H (Table 6 , entry 4c), affording 96% of 3,3-bis(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)indolin-2one within 5 min. A further increase in the amount of catalyst has no significant effect on the yield and reaction time (Table 4 , entries 4 and 5). The role of b-CD-SO 3 H as the catalyst has been confirmed when a similar reaction was carried out in the absence of catalyst (Table 4 , entry 1), giving only 60% yield with a longer reaction time 2 h. It indicates that b-CD-SO 3 H not only improves the yield of the product but also accelerates the rate of reaction. The significant presence of b-CD-SO 3 H has a great influence on the reaction time as well as the yield (Table 4 , entry 3). Temperature plays an important role, as at low temperature there is only a trace amount of product formed and required longer reaction time and as the temperature increases from 40\u00b0C to reflux the yields also increase with decrease in reaction time (Table 3) . A variety of structurally divergent isatins possessing different substituents were selected to understand the scope and generality of the b-CD-SO 3 H promoted reaction to form 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones. 26 The results obtained are summarized in Table 6 . For all the entries water was used as the solvent and the reaction was conducted under reflux condition. In all cases, the conversion was completed within 5-45 min with good to excellent yields except for 5-nitroindole (Table 6 entry 4e, 80% and entry 4i, 91%). A further increase in reaction time had no significant effect on the yields. In addition, the substituent on the aromatic indoles showed slightly different effects on the yields, reactions of aromatic indoles with electron-donating groups afforded little better yields of products than those with the electron-withdrawing groups ( Table 6 entry 4e, 80% and entry 4i, 91%).",
