            "text": "We have previously reported that the 3C-like proteinase of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is responsible for processing of the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins to three mature products of 24, 10, and 100 kDa (Liu et al., 1994 (Liu et al., , 1997 Ng and Liu, 1998) . The C-terminal cleavage site of the 100-kDa protein was defined to be the Q 891(1b) -S 892(1b) dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 15, 129 to 15, 134 (Liu and Brown, 1995). In this report, other cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase in the polyprotein encoded by the ORF 1b region were mapped by coexpression, deletion, and site-directed mutagenesis studies. Using two ORF 1b-specific antisera, V58 and V17, three more Q-S(G) dipeptide bonds, encoded by nucleotides 16,929 to 16,934, 18,492 to 18,497, and 19,506 to 19,511, respectively, were demonstrated to be the cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase. Cleavage at these four positions would result in the release of four mature products with molecular masses of approximately 68, 58, 39, and 35 kDa. Among them, the 39-and 35-kDa proteins were specifically identified in IBV-infected cells. Taken together with the 100-kDa protein previously identified, these results suggest that the ORF 1b region of IBV mRNA1 may be able to encode five mature products.",

            "text": "Coronavirus gene expression involves the production of six to seven mRNA species. The prototype species of the Coronaviridae, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), encodes six mRNA species in virus-infected cells. These include the genome-length mRNA (mRNA1) of 27.6 kilobases (kb) and five subgenomic mRNA species (mRNAs 2\u00b16) with sizes ranging from 2 to 7 kb. The available evidence demonstrates that the four virion structural proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and small envelope (E), are encoded by subgenomic mRNA 2, mRNA 4, mRNA 6, and the third ORF of mRNA 3, respectively (Liu and Inglis, 1991; Stern and Sefton, 1984) . Nucleotide sequencing of the genomic RNA of IBV has shown that the 5\u0408-terminal unique region of mRNA 1 contains two large ORFs (1a and 1b), with ORF 1a having the potential to encode a polyprotein of 441 kDa (1a polyprotein) and 1b having the potential to encode a polyprotein of 300 kDa (Fig. 1) . The downstream ORF 1b is produced as a fusion protein of 741 kDa with 1a (1a/1b polyprotein) by a ribosomal frameshift (Brierley et al., 1987 (Brierley et al., , 1989 . The 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins are expected to be cleaved by viral or cellular proteinases to produce functional products associated with viral RNA replication (Fig. 1) .",

These include two overlapping papain-like proteinase domains encoded by ORF 1a from nucleotide 4242 to 5553 and one serine proteinase domain of the picornavirus 3C proteinase group (3C-like proteinase) encoded between nucleotides 8937 and 9357 (Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991) (Fig. 1 ). The first papain-like proteinase domain has been demonstrated to be involved in processing of the 1a polyprotein to an 87-kDa mature viral product Lim and Liu, 1998) . A more important role in the processing of the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins may be played by the 3C-like proteinase domain, as more than 10 Q-S(G) dipeptide bonds have been predicted to be the cleavage sites of this proteinase (Gorbalenya et al., 1989) . Indeed, three mature viral products of 24, 10, and 100 kDa have been demonstrated to be released from the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins by the 3C-like proteinase-mediated proteolysis (Liu et al., 1994 (Liu et al., , 1997 Ng and Liu, 1998) . Characterization of the 3C-like proteinase demonstrates that the catalytic center of this proteinase is composed of the predicted nucleophilic cysteine residue (Cys 2922 ) and the histidine 2820 (His 2820 ) residue . Meanwhile, in vitro expression data suggest that this proteinase may be released from the 1a polyprotein as a 35-kDa protein by autoprocessing at two previously predicted Q-S (Q 2779 -S 2780 and Q 3086 -S 3087 ) dipeptide bonds (Tibbles et al., 1996) (see Fig. 1 ).",

            "text": "We have previously reported the identification of a 100-kDa protein encoded by nucleotides 12,313 to 15, 131 in IBV-infected Vero cells using an ORF 1b-specific antiserum V58 (Liu et al., 1994; . Two Q-S dipeptide bonds (Q 3928 -S 3929 and Q 891(1b) -S 892(1b) ) encoded by nucleotides 12,310 to 12,315 and 15, 129 to 15, 134, respectively, were determined to be the N-and C-terminal cleavage sites of the 100-kDa protein. In addition to the Q 891(1b) -S 892(1b) dipeptide bond, three more potential cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase have been predicted to be located in the 1b polyprotein (Fig.  1 ). The first one is the Q 1491(1b) -G 1492(1b) dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 16,929 to 16,934 ( Fig. 1) . In order to test if this is a genuine scissile bond of the 3C-like proteinase, plasmid pIBV14\u232c1Q 891(1b) -E (Fig. 2a) , which was constructed for studying the C-terminal cleavage site of the 100-kDa protein (see , was first expressed in Vero cells. As the Q 891(1b) -E mutation introduced in this construct significantly reduced the cleavage efficiency occurring at the Q 891(1b) -S 892(1b) dipeptide bond, it would allow us to use antiserum V58, which recognizes the 100-kDa protein only, to detect a fusion product containing the 100-kDa protein and products encoded by the downstream region (see Fig. 2a ). As expected, expression of pIBV14\u232c1Q 891(1b) -E led to the detection of four polypeptides by immunoprecipitation with antiserum V58 (Fig. 2b, lane 6 ). In addition to the 100-kDa cleavage product and a 160-kDa protein representing the full-length product expressed from this construct, a 125-kDa protein and a product migrating slightly more slowly on SDS\u00b1PAGE than the 125-kDa product were observed (Fig. 2b, lane 6) . The estimated molecular weight of the latter species is approximately 130 kDa (Fig. 2b, lane 6) . The apparent molecular masses of these two products and their expression patterns suggest that the C-termini of the 125-and 130-kDa proteins may be derived, respectively, from cleavage occurring at the Q 1491(1b) -G 1492(1b) dipeptide bond and from termination of translation at a UAA termination codon 47 amino acid residues downstream of the G 1492(1b) residue (see Fig. 2a ). It is therefore likely that cleavage may occur at the Q 1491(1b) -G 1492(1b) dipeptide bond.",

This plasmid was based on pIBV14\u232c1Q 891(1b) -E, but the Q 1491(1b) residue was mutated to an M by PCR (Fig. 2a) . Meanwhile, the 3\u0408 end of the IBV sequence present in pIBV14\u232c1Q 891(1b) -E was extended up to nucleotide 17,630 (Fig. 2a) . As can be seen, expression of pIBV21 resulted in the detection of three products (Fig. 2b , lane 5). In addition to the 100-kDa protein and the 180-kDa full-length product, a protein species migrating on SDS\u00b1PAGE much more slowly than the 125-kDa protein was observed (Fig. 2b , lane 5). Its apparent molecular weight of approximately 155 kDa suggested that it is a fusion protein comprising the 125-kDa protein and the product encoded by nucleotides 16,932 to 17,630 (Fig. 2a) . These results confirm that mutation of the Q 1491(1b) residue to an M completely blocked cleavage occurring at this position and suggest that the Q 1491(1b) -G 1492(1b) dipeptide bond is a cleavage site of the 3C-like proteinase. The IBV sequence used to raise antiserum V58 and the substitution mutations introduced are indicated. Also shown are the predicted cleavage products that could be detected by immunoprecipitation with antiserum V58 and a UAA termination codon located 47 amino acid residues downstream of the G 1492(1b) residue.

Plasmid DNAs were expressed in Vero cells using the vaccinia virus-T7 expression system (Fuerst et al., 1986) . Semiconfluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) and transfected with plasmid DNA using DOTAP according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). Cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine, lysates were prepared, and polypeptides were either analyzed directly (lanes 1\u00b13) or immunoprecipitated with antiserum V58 (lanes 4\u00b16). The radiolabeled polypeptides were separated on an SDS\u00b112.5% polyacrylamide gel and detected by fluorography. Control DNA (lanes 1 and 4)-a plasmid contains the IBV sequence from nucleotides 8693 to 13,896. HMW, high molecular weight markers (numbers indicate kilodaltons).",

For this purpose, plasmid pIBV1b4, which covers the IBV sequence from nucleotides 16,932 to 20,490 ( Fig. 3a ) was expressed either on its own or together with pIBV3C, a plasmid which contains the IBV sequence coding for the 3C-like proteinase and has been shown to possess trans-cleavage activity (Liu et al., 1997) . As the results in Fig. 3b show, expression of pIBV1b4 in Vero cells led to the synthesis of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 132 kDa, representing the full-length product encoded by this construct; this product was immunoprecipitated by antiserum V17 (Fig. 3b, lane 1) . No processing of the 132-kDa protein to smaller products was observed (Fig. 3b , lane 1). Cotransfection of pIBV1b4 with pIBV3C, however, resulted in the detection of five protein species (Fig. 3b , lane 2). In addition to the 132-kDa full-length product, four other protein species with apparent molecular masses of approximately 97, 74, 39, and 35 kDa, respectively, were also detected (Fig. 3b, lane 2) . Among them, the 132-, 97-, 74-, and 39-kDa products were immunoprecipitated efficiently by antiserum V17; only trace amount of the 35-kDa protein, however, was detected from the same cell lysate (Fig. 3b, lane 2) .

Cleavage at these two positions would result in the formation of three mature products with calculated molecular masses of 58, 38, and 34 kDa, respectively. The apparent molecular masses of 39 and 35 kDa of the two proteins detected from coexpression of pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C suggest that they may represent the two C-terminal cleavage products. To investigate this possibility, plasmid pIBV1b5 was constructed and expressed in Vero cells. This plasmid covers the IBV sequence from nucleotides 18,930 to 20,874 and has the potential to encode a product of 59 kDa (Fig. 4a) . Transfection of pIBV1b5 alone led to the synthesis of a polypeptide of approximately 59 kDa, consistent with the calculated full-length product of 59 kDa encoded by this construct (Fig. 4b, lane 1) . As expected, two additional products with apparent molecular masses of 24 and 35 kDa were produced from coexpression of pIBV1b5 and pIBV3C (Fig. 4b, lane 2) . The 35-kDa protein comigrates on SDS\u00b1PAGE with the 35-kDa protein produced from coexpression of pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C (Fig.  4b, lanes 2 and 4) , indicating that they are the same cleavage product from the C-terminal region of the 1b polyprotein. However, the detection of the 35-kDa protein from coexpression of pIBV1b5 and pIBV3C was disproportionately more efficient than that from coexpression of pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C (Fig. 4b, lanes 2 and 4) .

In a previous report, we showed that a 100-kDa mature viral protein was released from the 1a/1b polyprotein by the 3C-like proteinase at two Q-S dipeptide bonds (Q 3928 -S 3929 and Q 891(1b) -S 892(1b) ) (Liu et al., 1994; (see Fig. 1 ). In this report, we demonstrate that the 3C-like proteinase may also mediate cleavage at other three predicted Q-S(G) dipeptide bonds (Q 1491(1b) -G 1492(1b) , Q 2012(1b) -S 2013(1b) and Q 2350(1b) -S 2351(1b) ) located in the 1b region of the 1a/1b polyprotein (see Fig. 1 ). In addition to the 100-kDa protein, four mature viral products with calculated molecular masses of approximately 68, 58, 38, and 34 kDa would be released from the 1a/1b polyprotein by cleavage at these positions (see Fig. 1 ).

Mutagenesis studies presented in this report strongly suggest that the two predicted cleavage sites (Q 1491(1b) -G 1492(1b) and Q 2012(1b) -S 2013(1b) ) flanking the putative 58-kDa protein are genuine cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase. The expression and pro-cessing patterns shown also lend support to the genuine presence of the 58-kDa protein. In order to detect this product, a region-specific antiserum was raised in rabbits and was shown to be able to precipitate specifically the in vitro synthesized target products (data not shown). However, further application of this antiserum in identification of the putative 58-kDa protein from IBV-infected cells was hampered by the fact that it can cross-react with a cellular protein migrating on SDS\u00b1PAGE at approximately the same position as the 58-kDa protein (Liu et al., unpublished observations) . Two antisera against the putative 68-kDa metal-binding and helicase protein have been raised in rabbits. Both antisera can efficiently recognize the in vitro synthesized target proteins. However, it was consistently found that no specific processed product can be detected in cells either infected with IBV or transfected with plasmids covering the region. As the equivalent protein has recently been identified in cells infected with human coronavirus (Heusipp et al., 1997a) , it is likely that the 68-kDa protein is a genuine viral product. We are currently uncertain if the failure to detect this product is due to its rapid degradation in intact cells. Systematic analysis of the expression and accumulation of this putative protein is underway to address this possibility.",

Numbers indicate molecular mass in kilodaltons. the region encoding the putative 68-kDa protein is elusive, the previously predicted Q 1491(1b) -G 1492(1b) cleavage site was studied by using region-specific antiserum V58. For the same reason, plasmid pIBV14\u232c1Q 891(1b) -E, a construct containing two deletions and a mutation of the Q 891(1b) residue to an E, was expressed to study the expression and processing pattern of the regions flanking this site. The results generated as well as the mutagenesis studies reported here suggest that the Q 1491(1b) -G 1492(1b) dipeptide bond is a real scissile bond of the 3C-like proteinase. The rest two predicted cleavage sites (Q 2012(1b) -S 2013(1b) and Q 2350(1b) -S 2351(1b) ) were studied based on the trans-cleavage activity of the 3C-like proteinase. Once again, data generated from expression, deletion and mutagenesis studies indicate that they are genuine cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase. However, coexpression, pulse-chase and time course experiments presented in this study showed that cleavage at these two positions is much less efficient than other cleavage sites identified Liu et al., 1997) . As can be seen in Fig.  3c , the 97-kDa and 74-kDa intermediate cleavage products remained detectable even after chase for 10 h, suggesting that these two Q-S dipeptide bonds may be poor cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase. However, no intermediate cleavage products could be detected in virus-infected cells (Fig. 6 ). This may reflect some regulatory mechanisms controlling the balance between the production and accumulation of the proteinase and its substrate in virus-infected cells. In IBV-infected cells, the 3C-like proteinase is produced approximately five times as much as the 1a/1b polyprotein, as the 1a/1b polyprotein is expressed by ribosome frameshifting and the frameshifting efficiency is 25\u00b130% (Brierley et al., 1987 (Brierley et al., , 1989 . Approximately equal amounts of the proteinase and substrate, however, would be expected to be produced in a single cell by coexpression of two plasmids. It is therefore understandable that complete cleavage of the 1a/1b polyprotein can be achieved in virus-infected cells by an excess amount of the proteinase. Nevertheless, it would be of interest to define the sequence determinants that dictate the cleavage efficiency of a particular substrate.",

It would be of interest to see if the 39-kDa protein shows a similar cellular distribution to the 41-kDa protein.
