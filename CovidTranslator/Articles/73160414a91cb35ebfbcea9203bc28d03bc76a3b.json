Flunarizine, a diphenylmethylpiperazine used to treat migraine, inhibited HCV cell entry in vitro and in vivo in a genotype-dependent fashion. Analysis of mosaic viruses between susceptible and resistant strains revealed that E1 and E2 glycoproteins confer susceptibility to flunarizine. Time of addition experiments and single particle tracking of HCV demonstrated that flunarizine specifically prevents membrane fusion. Related phenothiazines and pimozide also inhibited HCV infection and preferentially targeted HCV genotype 2 viruses. However, phenothiazines and pimozide exhibited improved genotype coverage including the difficult to treat genotype 3. Flunarizine-resistant HCV carried mutations within the alleged fusion peptide and displayed cross-resistance to these compounds, indicating that these drugs have a common mode of action. Conclusion: These observations reveal novel details about HCV membrane fusion. Moreover, flunarizine and related compounds represent first-in-class HCV fusion inhibitors that merit consideration for repurposing as cost-effective component of HCV combination therapies.",

Proteolytic processing mediated by cellular and two viral proteases (NS2-3 and NS3-4A) liberates ten distinct HCV polypeptides (1) . The structural proteins core, E1 and E2 compose the virion with core encasing the viral RNA and the glycoproteins E1-E2 mediating receptor interactions and low pH triggered membrane fusion. The p7 ion channel is essential for virus assembly and protection of E1-E2 during virus release. The NS3, 4A, 4B, 5A and 5B assemble into a multi-protein complex critical for viral RNA replication. HCV is highly variable and viral strains are classified into seven distinct genotypes (GTs), 67 confirmed and 21 unassigned subtypes (2) .",

To identify molecules that would complement these therapies and that may reveal novel insights into other life cycle steps, we aimed at identifying inhibitors with a novel mode of action. In addition, such molecules should not suffer from potential viral cross-resistance to established drug classes. Thus, we chose a whole life cycle screening assay based on the GT2a chimeric Jc1luciferase reporter virus (JcR-2a) (8) , which interrogates HCV entry, RNA translation, polyprotein processing, RNA replication and virus assembly (Supporting Fig. S1 Fig. and  (6) ). Since inhibitors of the influenza A virus M2 ion channel have been used to treat humans and because HCV p7 is an ion channel protein essential for virus production, we screened a library of 23 compounds including several clinically approved ion channel inhibitors used to treat heart or neurologic conditions (Supporting Table ST1 ). Fifteen compounds inhibited HCV entry, assembly or release (Supporting Fig. S1 ). Flunarizine displayed an IC 50 value of 388nM (Supporting Table ST2 ) and a CC 50 value of 10.85\u03bcM which is equivalent to a therapeutic index (CC 50 /IC 50 ) of greater than 25 (Fig. 1A) .

Finally, we administered flunarizine to HCV cell entry reporter mice, which express crucial human co-factors for HCV entry and carry a luciferase reporter gene that is activated by the CRE-recombinase (12) . When these animals were challenged with infectious Jc1 expressing a CRErecombinase, flunarizine serum levels reached an average level of 133nM, which is close to the in vitro EC 50 value described above.

            "text": "Since flunarizine did not inhibit infection by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or human coronavirus (Supporting Figure S4 ), we investigated if it prevents HCV entry across all seven HCV genotypes. Therefore, Huh7-Lunet/hCD81/G-Luc cells were inoculated with chimeric HCV viruses in the presence of increasing doses of flunarizine ( Fig. 2A) . All non-GT2 strains displayed resistance towards this drug with IC 50 values more than an order of magnitude greater than Jc1. The GT2b isolate showed an intermediate phenotype with an IC 50 value of 3.69\u03bcM and both GT2a isolates -JFH1 and Jc1-were highly susceptible displaying IC 50 values of 0.37\u03bcM and 0.22 \u03bcM, respectively. To map the determinants of flunarizine susceptibility, we shuffled viral core to NS2 proteins between the resistant Con1 (GT1b) and the susceptible Jc1 (GT2a). Transfer of Con1-derived p7 into Jc1 did not render the resulting virus (Jc1/Con1-p7) resistant to flunarizine (Fig. 2B ). In contrast, insertion of the Con1-derived E1-E2 proteins into Jc1 did confer flunarizine resistance to Jc1/Con1-E1-E2. Conversely, replacement of the Con1-derived E1-E2 sequences by those of Jc1 rendered the Con1 chimera (Con1-/J6-E1-E2) susceptible to the drug (Fig. 2B ). Therefore, susceptibility to flunarizine is governed by determinants resident in the E1-E2 genes. Likewise, when we exchanged structural proteins, p7 or NS2 between J6 (GT2a) or J8 (GT2b), all viruses carrying the J6 E1-E2 genes displayed greater susceptibility to flunarizine compared with those harboring the J8-derived glycoproteins (Supporting Figure  S5A ). A chimeric virus carrying J8 derived E2 in the backbone of Jc1 produced infectious virus and exhibited partial resistance to flunarizine indicating that determinants in both E1 and E2 influence susceptibility to this drug (Supporting Figure S5B ). Next, we used HCV particles trans-complemented with primary E1-E2 gene sequences from GT2a-and GT2binfected patients (13) . Also these clinical GT2a isolates were susceptible to flunarizine, whereas the GT2b isolates were resistant (Fig. 2C ). Finally, we created HCV transcomplemented particles carrying E1-E2 proteins from six additional GT2 subtypes including d, e, k, m, q, and r. All of these strains were susceptible to inhibition by flunarizine, albeit to variable degrees (Fig. 2D ). Collectively, this indicates that flunarizine interferes with HCV entry by targeting viral E1-E2 protein function(s) of almost all GT2 subtypes tested and with a clear preference for GT2 over other viral genotypes.",

After ten weeks we observed drug resistance as infection of Huh7-Lunet/ hCD81/G-Luc cells by virus populations cultured in the presence of the drug was poorly inhibited by flunarizine compared to viruses cultured in the presence of DMSO (Fig. 3A) . Sequencing revealed conserved amino acid mutations at positions M267V in E1 (A1140G in H77 genome), Q289H in E1 (A1208C in H77 genome), M405T in E2 (T1554C in H77 genome) and I757T in p7 (T2603C in H77 genome), which we engineered into the parental Jc1-luciferase virus either alone or in combination. Insertion of the p7 mutation did not change susceptibility to flunarizine (Fig. 3B ). In contrast, the E2 mutation and both Interestingly, E1 residue Q289 is fully conserved among all HCV sequences deposited in the gene bank database (Fig. 3C) . Additionally, 88.5 % of all GT2 isolates carry M267 which correlates with susceptibility to flunarizine in our GT2a virus Jc1, whereas all non-GT2 sequences encode glycine at this position (Supporting Table ST3 ). Finally, the E2 mutation resides in the hypervariable region, an important yet strain specific viral neutralizing epitope. The full conservation of 289 in E1 and the high level of conservation of 267 in E1 may indicate important functional constraints that could limit viral escape in vivo. To explore this, we evaluated neutralization of the flunarizine resistant virus by potent monoclonal antibodies. Neutralization by the E2-targeting HC-11 and AR4A antibodies was significantly enhanced by the flunarizine resistance mutations (Fig. 3D) . Collectively, a combination of three mutations -in part affecting highly conserved residues-is necessary to confer a 50-fold resistance to flunarizine. These mutations render HCV more susceptible to neutralizing antibodies, suggesting a high barrier to viral resistance.",

            "text": "To precisely define the mode of action of flunarizine, we conducted time-of-addition experiments including HCV entry inhibitors which arrest HCV infection at distinct stages of cell entry (Supporting Figure S6 ). Since flunarizine resistance was reached at a time point similar to resistance to inhibitors of endosomal acidification (e.g. concanamycin A), this suggested that flunarizine inhibits a late entry step. To explore this further, we used an HCV plasma membrane fusion assay where cells are pre-treated with concanamycin A to prevent viral entry and membrane fusion via the normal route through acidified endosomes (7) (Fig.  4 ). Under these circumstances, HCV fusion and thus productive infection can be triggered by briefly exposing virus inoculated cells to a low pH buffer. Because HCV membrane fusion requires receptor interactions including the binding to CD81 (14) the virus is receptive to this exogenous trigger (low pH buffer) only after an incubation of ca. 1h at 37\u00b0C (7) . Thus, Huh7-Lunet/hCD81 cells were continuously treated with concanamycin A and additional drugs were added either directly after virus inoculation and throughout the experiment until 4h post temperature shift (Fig. 4A , protocol I), only during the incubation with low pH buffer (protocol II) or only directly subsequent to the fusion triggering low pH wash (protocol III). A buffer with neutral pH 7 was used to control that productive infection fully depends on low pH-induced fusion. As expected, HCV infection only occurred when cells were exposed to low pH buffer, since only then luciferase expression above the background of uninfected cells was detected (Fig. 4B ). When DMSO was added to the cells according to protocol I, II or III, the low pH wash resulted in high luciferase activity approximately 50-fold above the background of mock infected cells or virus inoculated cells treated with the neutral pH buffer (Fig. 4B) . Addition of bafilomycin A1, which like concanamycin A prevents acidification of endosomes, did not have an antiviral effect, regardless of the administration protocol. This confirms that HCV can only access cells by exogenous administration of low pH, independently of endosomal acidification. Moreover, all inhibitors had completely lost antiviral activity when applied directly after the low pH fusion trigger, indicating that they exert their antiviral activity by blocking HCV entry Perin et al.",

Following DiD-HCV fusion and uncoating, there is an increase in distribution of fluorescence due to mixing of DiD with cellular membranes, which can be quantified (15) . Huh-7.5 cells were grown in extracellular matrix to form hepatic spheroids, were treated with either flunarize or the vehicle control, infected with DiD-HCV and imaged for colocalization with either the tight junction marker zona occludins (ZO)-1 or the early endosomal marker early endosomal antigen (EEA)-1 over a time course of entry. We observed that flunarizine did not affect the localization of DiD-HCV to the tight junction (Fig. 5A, B) nor did it affect the internalization and localization of DiD-HCV with the early endosome (Fig. 5C, D) . Treatment with flunarizine did decrease DiD-HCV fusion, which is evidenced by significantly lower DiD fluorescence volume at 360min post temperature shift as compared to the vehicle control (Fig. 5E,F) . Therefore, flunarizine does not affect HCV trafficking and endocytosis but inhibits fusion of HCV with the endosomal membrane.",

            "text": "Flunarizine is a T-type Ca 2+ channel inhibitor and belongs to the group of diarylmethyl piperazine drugs. A range of structurally related drugs (e.g. pimozide) are known which also block Ca 2+ ion channels and which are used as anti-psychotic drugs (16) . Moreover, phenothiazines such as fluphenazine and trifluoperazine are also important drugs in which the phenothiazine group resembles the biarylmethyl group. Indeed, all of these have emerged as potent HCV inhibitors in our screening (Supporting Figure S1 ). Therefore, we explored if inhibition of Ca 2+ ion channels in general is essential for the antiviral activity of these molecules. Furthermore, we investigated if these drugs inhibit HCV via an antiviral mechanism comparable to flunarizine. To address this we explored the influence of 1,2bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) and ethylene glycol tetra acetic acid (EGTA), two Ca 2+ -chelating agents, which sequester intracellular and extracellular Ca 2+ -pools, respectively, on the antiviral activity of flunarizine. Although both BAPTA and EGTA were administered at high doses, they did not modulate the antiviral activity of flunarizine indicating inhibition of HCV entry by flunarizine does not depend on availability of Ca 2+ (Fig. 6A ). Next we explored if mibefradil (17), penfluridol (18), or NiCl 2 (19) , three well established inhibitors of T-type Ca 2+ channels, interfere with HCV infection. Neither of these molecules inhibited infection of parental HCV or flunarizineresistant HCV (Fig. 6B ). In contrast, both phenothiazines (fluphenazine and trifluoperazine) and pimozide preferentially inhibited the parental virus and were less active against the variant with flunarizin resistance mutations. The antiviral activity of BJ486K (20) and curcumin (21) -two molecules that inhibit HCV cell entry by different molecular mechanisms -was not influenced by these mutations (Fig. 6B) . While this work was in preparation, Chamoun-Emmanueli reported that selected phenothiazines inhibit HCV entry potentially by increasing the fluidity of cholesterol-rich membranes (22) . This prompted us to explore if viral susceptibility to flunarizine correlates with susceptibility to modulation of membrane fluidity achieved by depletion of cholesterol using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Interestingly, we observed that Jc1 was significantly more susceptible to cholesterol depletion than a genotype 5a virus, which has high endogenous flunarizine resistance (Fig.  6C) . Moreover, also the flunarizine-resistant Jc1-variant was significantly more resistant to depletion of cholesterol compared with parental Jc1 (Fig. 6C ). This suggests that differences in the dependence of the HCV fusion machinery on membrane properties may in part determine susceptibility to flunarizine, phenothiazines and pimozide. However, in our experiments these drugs did not modulate membrane fluidity (Supporting Figure S7 ) nor cellular cholesterol content (Supporting Figure S8 ), suggesting that other membrane changes are responsible for fusion inhibition.",

In conclusion, the antiviral activity of flunarizine and related compounds is not directly linked with their ability to inhibit Ca 2+ ion channels. Nevertheless, viral cross-resistance and comparable genotypespecificity between flunarizine, these phenothiazines and pimozide, strongly argue for a shared antiviral mode of action.",

Firstly, these drugs which all inhibit cellular Ca 2+ -channels, may prevent fusion by changing Ca 2+fluxes in HCV target cells and/or by directly blocking the interaction of HCV with a Ca 2+channel critical for membrane fusion. However, not all tested Ca 2+ -channel targeting drugs also arrested HCV infection. Moreover, sequestration of Ca 2+ did not modulate the antiviral activity of flunarizine. Therefore, we consider it unlikely that inhibition of Ca 2+ -channels by these drugs -which then would be used by HCV in a genotype-dependent fashion -is responsible for the anti-HCV activity of this class of molecules.",

            "text": "Secondly, it is possible that flunarizine, pimozide and phenothiazines directly bind E1-E2, thereby inhibiting membrane fusion. The genotype-specificity of the antiviral activity supports this notion since sequence variation may prevent drug binding. However, HCVpp carrying the same viral envelope proteins as flunarizine-susceptible HCVcc particles are not inhibited by flunarizine, arguing against this. Also Chockalingam et al. and Hu et al. reported resistance of HCVpp to flunarizine leading them to conclude that flunarizine is likely not an entry inhibitor (10, 11) . Our data, however, show that flunarizine inhibits entry of authentic HCV at the stage of membrane fusion. This highlights an as yet unexplored difference between the mode of HCVpp and HCVcc membrane fusion which may arise because HCVpp are produced in 293T cells rather than in human liver cells. Consequently, HCVpp could differ in lipid and lipoprotein composition thus affecting cell entry. Notably, it has been reported that receptor usage can differ between HCVcc and HCVpp with only the former using the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 cholesterol absorption receptor for cell entry (23) . Furthermore, Meertens and colleagues observed that cholesterol depletion of the host cell had no effect on the entry of HCVpp, whereas it was antiviral for HCVcc (24) . Therefore, the resistance mutations identified by us could be part of a direct drug binding site, or they could modulate the conformation and function of E1-E2 in membrane fusion which seems to be exquisitely cholesterol dependent for HCVcc particles. The E1 domain from residue 264 to 290 has previously been implicated in harboring an HCV fusion peptide based on phylogenetic comparison with related flaviviruses, sequence conservation and hydrophobicity (25) . The observation that drugs that specifically inhibit membrane fusion select for viral resistance in this region indirectly supports the notion that this peptide is critical for fusion. The crystal structures of E2 did not reveal evidence for a major role of E2 as fusion protein so that E1 is now assumed to be the primary fusion protein of HCV (26, 27) . This is also supported by earlier studies (28) (29) (30) .",

In fact, while this work was in preparation Chamoun-Emanuelli reported that this was the case for specific phenothiazines including fluphenazine and trifluoperazine, also characterized by us (22) . Intriguingly, we observed a correlation between HCV susceptibility to flunarizine and susceptibility of HCV to cholesteroldepletion induced changes in membrane properties. This result is compatible with the notion that also flunarizine and pimozide -like phenothiazines -modulate membrane fluidity and that this is the antiviral principle of these groups of compounds. In turn, the genotypespecific antiviral activity of these molecules implies that viral strains differ with regard to membrane requirements during fusion. The cholesterol depletion experiment reported here, which shows that Jc1 is more susceptible to cholesterol depletion compared to the flunarizine resistant Jc1 and to a flunarizine resistant strain (GT5a) supports this notion. However, unlike Chamoun-Emanuelli but consistent with Thomas and Verkleij we did not observe a modification of membrane fluidity by flunarizin and related drugs (31) . This discrepancy between studies may be due to differences in the assay set up including the composition of liposomes (Supporting Figure S7) . Moreover, flunarizine and related compounds did not extract cholesterol from Huh-7.5 cells -even upon prolonged incubation (Supporting Figure S8 ).",

Viruses produced at this time point were used to inoculate target cells where F-Luc activity was determined 48h later (whole life cycle). (B) Huh7-Lunet/hCD81/G-Luc cells were inoculated with F-Luc-Jc1 and flunarizine or solvent for 4h. Infection was measured 48h afterwards (C) Primary human hepatocytes were incubated with the indicated compounds and Jc1 for 6h. The supernatant of inoculated cells was collected at 24 and 48h and virus infectivity was determined by TCID 50 . (D) HCV entry reporter mice expressing firefly luciferase in a Cre-dependent manner were pretreated with indicated compounds. Subsequently, they were challenged with a Jc1 variant expressing Cre recombinase. HCV-Cre-dependent luciferase expression, which reflects HCV cell entry efficiency, was determined 24h later.
