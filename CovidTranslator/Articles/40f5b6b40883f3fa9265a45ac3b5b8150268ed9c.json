Currently available PEDV vaccine strains have limited protective effects against PEDV variant strains. Methods: In this study, the highly virulent epidemic virus strain CT was serially passaged in Vero cells for up to 120 generations (P120). Characterization of the different passages revealed that compared with P10 and P64, P120 had a higher viral titer and more obvious cytopathic effects, thereby demonstrating better cell adaptability. Results: Pathogenicity experiments using P120 in piglets revealed significant reductions in clinical symptoms, histopathological lesions, and intestinal PEDV antigen distribution; the piglet survival rate in the P120 group was 100%. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing identified 13 amino acid changes in P120, which might be responsible for the attenuated virulence of P120.",

For each amplicon, more than three independent clones were sequenced to determine the accurate sequence of a specific genomic region. All sequencing results were then spliced and aligned using Lasergene SeqMan and Lasergene MegAlign, respectively. All reference sequences were obtained from GenBank and used for sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. All phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA7.0 software.",

The piglets were then placed in separate cages and randomly divided into four experimental groups. Each group was placed in a separate room (Biosafety level 2).

Amino acid comparison indicated that there were only four amino acid mutations (D265A, F635R, S887R and C1362G) between P10 and P120. In addition, several nucleotide point mutations resulted in aa substitutions in ORF1ab (A1538S, T1945 N, D2813G, H2925Y, Y3302S and V4566I), ORF3 (T45 M), E (P70L) and M (G159D) proteins.

Currently, vaccination is an effective solution to tackling the virus; however, owing to variations in the virus [18] , the classical attenuated vaccine does not provide effective protection. Thus, the epidemic strains of the virus must be urgently studied to prepare a new attenuated vaccine. In the classical method, attenuated vaccines are prepared via cell passaging [16, 17, 29, 30] . Some previous studies have reported that increased viral titers and enhanced cell adaptability are the characteristics of viruses with weakened virulence [4, 13, 26] . In the present study, we passaged the epidemic PEDV CT strain continuously in Vero cells for up to 120 generations and observed that P120 had better cell adaptability than the other two strains; thus, our findings illustrated that increased passaging increases the cell adaptability and titers.",

Thus, the virulence of the three PEDV strains was assessed to confirm whether the P120 strain was weakened. According to data from animal experiments, the P120 strain could significantly reduce clinical symptoms, viral shedding, and histopathological changes in piglets. Therefore, our results illustrated that the P120 strain had relatively weak virulence and that compared with the P10 and P64 strains, it caused lesser damage to the piglets. Thus, it can be concluded that the P120 strain is safe and potentially useful as a candidate strain for the preparation of an attenuated vaccine.",

And the method to prepare attenuated vaccine by cell passage can also get clues to the key virulence factors of the virus [29] . The PEDV S protein is involved in receptor binding, viral entry, neutralizing antibody production induction, and host cell fusion [9] . The S protein of PEDV has always been used as a marker of viral variation. Under the pressure of herd immunity, the S gene of PEDV mutates frequently, with some of the missense mutations altering viral antigenicity to aid in the virus's escape from preexisting immunity. Thus, periodic vaccine updates may be required to ensure sufficient efficacy against emerging virus variants [31] . In this study, our result revealed that there is little variation in the S gene among these PEDV strains. Moreover, S protein is implicated in virulence, which was found out in the other studies that S protein can be variant readily while receiving immune pressure [32] . Mutations, including deletions and/or insertions, in the S protein may change the pathogenicity and tissue tropism of coronaviruses [33] . Comparing to the P10 strain, there was no nucleotides insertion and deletion in the S gene of the P120 strain. However, we found that there were four amino acid mutations (D265A, F635R, S887R and C1362G) between the P10 strain and the P120 strain.

The front ends of the three different sub-strains have been labeled. PEDV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus These mutations have not been reported previously. This finding indicates that these mutations in the S gene may be related to viral pathogenicity.",

In this study, the T45 M mutation was detected in ORF3 of P120. Furthermore, mutations of amino acids in the ORF1ab, M, and E regions of P120 indicate that multiple mutation combinations in the genome cause complete decay of the PEDV strain via various molecular mechanisms [5] .
