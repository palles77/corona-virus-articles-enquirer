Induced sputum samples were analysed for 18 viruses by antigen detection and PCR, and for six bacteria by culture and PCR. Viruses were found in 72% of samples, bacteria in 91%, and both in 66%. Rhinovirus (30%), human bocavirus (18%) and human metapneumovirus (14%) were the most commonly detected viruses. Two viruses were found in 22% of samples and three in 8%. The most common bacteria found were Streptococcus pneumoniae (50%), Haemophilus influenzae (38%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (28%). Rhinovirus-S. pneumoniae was the most commonly found combination of virus and bacterium (16%). All six children with treatment failure had both viruses and bacteria detected in the sputum. Otherwise, we found no special clinical characteristics in those with mixed viral-bacterial detections. With modern molecular diagnostic techniques, there are high rates of both viral and bacterial identification in childhood CAP. The clinical significance of mixed viral-bacterial infections remains unclear, although we found a potential association between them and treatment failure.",

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), human bocavirus (HBoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) are the most common viruses associated with pneumonia [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .

Pneumonia was defined as the presence of pneumonic infiltrates (alveolar or interstitial) on the chest radiograph with simultaneous signs and/or symptoms of acute infection. Sputum production was induced by inhalation of 5.0% hypertonic saline solution, and the sputum sample was obtained by aspirating through the nostrils (N = 69) or by expectoration if the child was old enough to produce an adequate sputum sample (N = 7). A good-quality sputum sample with <25 squamous epithelial cells and >25 leukocytes per low-power field was obtained from 76 of 133 children otherwise eligible for the study. The details of the sputum collection method and preliminary microbiological results have been described previously by Lahti et al. [9] . Viral antigen detection (influenza A and B viruses, PIV types 1, 2 and 3, RSV, and adenovirus (AdV)) by timeresolved fluoroimmunoassay, and nucleic acid detection by quantitative RT-PCR for enteroviruses, RV, RSV and HMPV, and quantitative PCR for HBoV, were performed as described previously [9] . We completed these viral studies to maximize the number and variety of viruses recovered from respiratory tract samples. Multiplex RT-PCR (Seeplex RV12 ACE Detection; Seegene, Seoul, Korea) was used for the detection of 12 respiratory pathogens (AdV, influenza A and B viruses, RSV A and B, HMPV, PIV types 1, 2 and 3, RV A and B, and coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and OC43/ HKU1) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequence analysis was used for RV species determination as described elsewhere [11] . In addition, quantitative RT-PCRs detecting human parechoviruses, PIV4, influenza C virus, and quantitative PCR for AdV, were performed in separate assays. The assay for human parechovirus has been described in detail elsewhere [12] . The assays for PIV4, influenza C virus, and AdV are described in the Supporting Information.",

RV, either alone or in combination with other viruses or bacteria, was identified in one-third of the studied children. In previous studies, RV has been detected in 14-45% of children with pneumonia, suggesting a significant role for RV in childhood pneumonia [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Our detection rates for HBoV and HMPV were also in line with earlier studies. Recent studies have identified HMPV in 1-13% of children with pneumonia [3, 4, [6] [7] [8] 13, 14] . The role of HBoV as a causative agent of pneumonia is more difficult to assess, because, after a primary infection, HBoV may persist for a longer time than other respiratory viruses [15] . In a prospective study by Fry et al. [16] , HBoV was detected in 12% of hospitalized children <5 years of age who had pneumonia. Moreover, HBoV was recently identified [17] . Globally, RSV continues to be the major pneumonia causative virus [18] . In our study, RSV was detected at lower rates (7%) than reported by other investigators, (15-29%) [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] 13, 14] , but this can be explained by our study period being between two RSV epidemics. With sputum samples as diagnostic specimens, bacteria were demonstrated in 69 of our 76 study children. PCR broadened the detection rate of bacteria substantially. Almost half of our study population had intravenous antibiotic treatment started before the collection of sputum samples, which probably explains why some had negative results in the bacterial culture with concurrent positive results in bacterial PCR. Of bacterial detections, 41% included more than one bacterium and 72% included a concomitant viral detection (Table 2) , which complicates investigation of the role of each microorganism in the pathogenesis and clinical features of illness. Two-thirds of our patients had viral-bacterial co-detections, as compared with rates between 15% and 45% reported in previous aetiological studies of childhood CAP [2, 3, [5] [6] [7] 9, 10] . A popular view is that primary viral infection is followed by secondary bacterial infection. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate the true incidence of mixed viral-bacterial infections, because the earlier infection may easily be undetected.",

Some evidence suggests that mixed viral-bacterial infections may potentially induce more severe disease than individual viral or bacterial infections [21] [22] [23] . Previously, mixed influenza virus-S. aureus infection has been shown to be able to cause severe, fatal pneumonia in children [22] [23] [24] [25] , and mixed RV-S. pneumoniae infection has been shown to be associated with severe pneumonia in adults [26] . In children with invasive pneumococcal disease, viral co-infections are also common and are possibly associated with higher mortality [27] . Limited evidence suggests that viral co-infections may also induce more severe clinical illness than individual viral infections. Cilla et al. [4] have reported children with viral coinfections being hospitalized more frequently than those infected with a single virus. In addition, Esposito et al. [19] demonstrated that HBoV co-infections with other viruses were associated with greater disease burden (more hospitalizations and loss of school days) in children with respiratory tract infection than in those with HBoV infection alone. In our study, it is of interest that all children (8%) with treatment failure had evidence of mixed viral-bacterial infection.",

The duration of the study period was short. Only the sputum samples with a high leukocyte count were included in this study. This may have influenced our results, especially in terms of viruses which may not induce leukocytes to the sputum. We did not use serology, which could have established infections caused by some viruses. It must be stressed that the detection of bacteria or viruses in the sputum sample does not necessarily mean that they are the causative agents of the concomitant lung infection. Bacteria might be contaminants from the nasopharynx, which, in healthy young children, often carries pathogenic bacteria. The detected virus might be found because of the concomitant upper respiratory tract infection. Furthermore, respiratory viruses, especially RV, have been detected in asymptomatic children (up to 60% in children <1 year of age) [28, 29] , but prolonged shedding of RV is not known. Some respiratory viruses, such as HBoV and enteroviruses, may show prolonged shedding for months after acute infection [16] . Some bacteria, such as M. catarrhalis, are known to be less virulent and less likely to cause pneumonia [30] . Some respiratory DNA viruses, such as AdV, may be latent, and may be found by PCR but not be associated with the symptomatic infection. Thus, it is clear that the term 'causative agent' should be used with caution.",
