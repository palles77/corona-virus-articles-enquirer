Two main parameters can be considered; flesh pigmentation and the food conversion index. A decrease in these parameters can have serious consequences upon the classification (~ label ~) of the animals and therefore upon commercial benefits ; such a decrease may be associated with an enteritis syndrome, as has been observed in various species of commercial birds in Aquitaine since December 1985.",
