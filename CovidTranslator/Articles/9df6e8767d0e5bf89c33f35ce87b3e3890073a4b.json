The virus genetically differs considerably from those of SARSr-CoV and MERSr-CoV. Current studies show that the homology between 2019-nCoV and bat-SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45) is over 85%. When cultured in vitro, 2019-nCoV can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells after about 96 hours, while it takes about 6 days to isolate and culture Vero E6 and Huh-7 cell lines.",

(b) High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) or non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV): When respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia cannot be relieved after standard oxygen therapy, HFNC or NIV should be considered. If the condition does not improve or even worsen within a short period of time (1\u22122 hours), endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be performed promptly. (c) Invasive mechanical ventilation: Use lung protective ventilation strategies, which means small tidal volume (4-8 ml/kg ideal weight) and low inspiratory pressure (platform pressure < 30 cmH 2 O) for mechanical ventilation to reduce ventilator-related lung injuries. For several patients, human-machine synchronization is not available, and sedative and muscle relaxants should be used in time. (d) Salvage treatment: For patients with severe ARDS, it is recommended to perform lung expansion. If possible, prone position ventilation should be performed for >12 hours per day. For those with poor prone position ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered as soon as possible if conditions permit.",
