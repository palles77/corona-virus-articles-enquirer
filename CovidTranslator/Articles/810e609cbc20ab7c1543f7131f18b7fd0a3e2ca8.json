However, the inevitable risk of mismatched priming cannot be avoided in the currently used primer system, even though considerable time and effort are devoted to primer design and optimization of reaction conditions. Here, we report a novel dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) which contains two separate priming regions joined by a polydeoxyinosine linker. The linker assumes a bubble-like structure which itself is not involved in priming, but rather delineates the boundary between the two parts of the primer. This structure results in two primer segments with distinct annealing properties: a longer 5 0 -segment that initiates stable priming, and a short 3 0 -segment that determines targetspecific extension. This DPO-based system is a fundamental tool for blocking extension of non-specifically primed templates, and thereby generates consistently high PCR specificity even under less than optimal PCR conditions. The strength and utility of the DPO system are demonstrated here using multiplex PCR and SNP genotyping PCR.",

Achieving a high level of specificity in priming currently requires very rigid primer search parameters and optimization of PCR conditions. Even when these requirements are satisfied, a high risk of nonspecific priming is inevitable.",

            "text": "In order to fundamentally block non-specific priming, we have developed a novel dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) system that is structurally and functionally different from the primer system currently in widespread use. The conventional priming system is based on a single priming event between the primer and template, in which mismatches in priming can lead to extension of non-specific products. In contrast, the DPO system has two separate primer segments, one of which is longer than the other, joined by a polydeoxyinosine [poly(I)] linker ( Figure 1A ). Deoxyinosine (I) is known to have a relatively low melting temperature compared to the natural bases, due to weaker hydrogen bonding (4) . Thus, we hypothesized that a poly(I) linker inserted between two stretches of natural bases would form a bubble-like structure and separate a single primer into two functional regions at a certain annealing temperature: a 5 0 -segment 18-25 nt in length and a 3 0 -segment 6-12 nt in length. This unequal distribution of nucleotides leads to different annealing preferences for each segment. The longer 5 0 -segment preferentially binds to the template DNA and initiates stable annealing, whereas the short 3 0 -segment selectively binds to its target site and blocks non-specific annealing. Therefore, only target-specific extension will result from the successive priming of the 5 0 -segment and the 3 0 -segment of the DPO.",

            "text": "The DPO is composed of three regions, a longer 5 0 -segment a shorter 3 0 -segment and a poly(I) linker that bridges these two segments. In designing the DPO ( Figure 1A ), the position of the 3 0 -segment was determined first, at a site where 6-12 bases had a 40-80% GC content and the T M was not considered. Five deoxyinosines were designated for the poly(I) linker since they had generated the best result when 3-8 deoxyinosines were tested to determine the optimum length of the linker. The 5 0 -segment of the DPO was automatically determined by the sequence of the bases upstream of the 3 0 -segment and extended 18-25 bases, until the T M was 4658C. The secondary structure and dimers were not considered in the design of the DPO because the 3 0 -segment alone, which is physically separated by the linker from the 5 0 -segment, is too short to form such structures stably. Viral genes are highly variable; therefore, in order to generate virus-specific DPOs, the length of the 5 0 -segment of the DPO was increased so that it had an even higher T m (70-908C). The long conventional primers comprise sequences identical to the DPO primers except the poly(I) linker regions. The sequences of the primers, as well as their annealing temperatures, are given in Table 1 . For correct prediction of the T m values of primers which contains deoxyinosine, we used HYTHER TM (http://ozone3.chem.wayne.edu/) which adopts the nearest neighbor model with optimized thermodynamic parameters for deoxyinosine pairs in DNA duplex (5) .",

SNPs are the most common type of DNA sequence variation in the human genome, and are an important genetic factor in the origin and development of complex genetic traits in humans (11, 12) . Appropriate methods for SNP genotyping are important in many fields of biological science, and several different methods for detecting SNPs in the human genome have been introduced (13) . However, an ideal PCR-based SNP detection method, one that is simple and provides an accurate genotype without additional verification steps such as sequencing, does not currently exist. We carried out multiplex PCR analysis of nine human genomic DNA samples with known genotypes at the CYP2C19 locus ( Figure 3 , lanes 1-3 and 10-12, allele 1/allele 2; lanes 4-6 and 13-15, allele 1/allele 1; lanes 7-9 and 16-18, allele 2/allele 2) using two different DPO primer sets to detect the three different allelic combinations (Figure 3 ).

The DPO system differs structurally and functionally from the conventional primer system by including a poly(I) linker, which is one of the most commonly used universal bases (14) , between two segments of primer sequences ( Figure 1A ). In general, primers 425 bases are rarely used, since the T m s of 25 mers or the longer primers can be over 708C, which is too high for proper annealing (15) . This is a fundamental limitation in current conventional primer design. However, the long DPO primer (34-42 mer) is divided into two distinct target-specific priming segments by the presence of the poly(I) linker, and, thus, does not suffer from the limitations of a high T m . In addition, the two priming segments of differing lengths have distinct priming functions. For example, at the general annealing temperatures of 55-658C, stable annealing is initiated only by the longer 5 0 -segment since it has a high enough T m (over 508C) to bind to the template. Target-specific extension is then determined by the shorter 3 0 -segment, resulting in unparalleled high specificity. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of DPO, we compared the performance of the DPO system to that of the conventional primer system in multiplex PCR and SNP genotyping PCR. Overall our results demonstrate that the DPO system has dramatically improved performance. DPO primers are easier to design than conventional primers. In designing conventional primers, the sequence should be carefully checked for certain primer design features such as primer length, melting temperature, GC content and secondary structure (16) . In contrast, we believe that a DPO can be designed based on almost any sequence of interest since the poly(I) linker prevents formation of secondary structure and effectively eliminates non-specific priming. This is very advantageous, particularly for detection of pathogens such as virus and bacteria since their sequences are highly variable and available primer sites are highly restricted. Table 1 .",

Therefore, current multiplex PCR-based assays require further validation, such as nested PCR or a probe hybridization assay (7, 8) . However, DPO allows specific detection of a large number of pathogens without any false result because the bubblelike structure of the poly(I) linker in DPO efficiently prevents primer-dimer and hairpin structure formation. The example presented here (Figure 2 ) demonstrates the successful use of the DPO-based multiplex PCR for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses with one PCR step. The high specificity without production of any non-specific bands or false-positive products clearly demonstrates the great potential of DPO-based multiplex PCR approaches to be a reliable, rapid, practical and cost-effective detection method.",
