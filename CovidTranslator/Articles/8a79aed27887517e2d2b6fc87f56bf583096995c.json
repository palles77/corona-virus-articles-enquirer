            "text": "Tracking the spread of infectious disease Two networks prove the power of international collaboration T he Eco-Challenge, organized annually from 1995 to 2002, was a gruelling adventure race in which teams ran, swam, sailed and biked across rugged terrain, often in remote parts of the world. Participants in the 2000 race in Sabahformerly North Borneo-were prepared to meet many challenges; what they did not anticipate was swimming through a river contaminated with Leptospira, the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease called leptospirosis (Sejvar et al, 2003) . One participant developed fever and jaundice after returning to the UK and was diagnosed with leptospirosis by a travel medicine clinic in London. Within 12 hours, messages went out to clinics all across the world to alert them to the possibility of leptospirosis in participants from the Eco-Challenge. Those individuals who were still in the incubation period were notified and treated. This swift and effective response was orchestrated by an international infectious disease-monitoring organization called GeoSentinel. By cataloguing and analysing data on international travellers who report to a travel medicine clinic, GeoSentinel-and a similar European-based initiative called TropNetEurop-aim to develop a comprehensive picture of the spread of infectious diseases as it occurs.",

Moreover, a traveller who returns home with an unusual disease could be the first clue to a new outbreak.",

            "text": "GeoSentinel and TropNetEurop tap into this resource by providing a system for sharing information among their networks of travel medicine clinics. Doctors record the travel histories and symptoms of their patients and their diagnoses in standardized electronic forms and submit these by e-mail to a central database. Investigators, including epidemiologists and statisticians, regularly examine the data to detect 'blips' that might indicate a new outbreak, which would warrant a warning to participating clinics. The database coordinators also look for long-term disease trends, issue regular summaries to their member sites and report some findings in medical journals. Last January, for example, GeoSentinel published an article describing which diseases travellers are most likely to acquire in different parts of the world (Freedman et al, 2006) . T here are various national and international bodies that track infectious disease, but GeoSentinel and Trop-NetEurop are distinctive in several ways. First, they are interested in diseases only in international travellers, not those confined to local populations. This allows them to focus on diseases that have escaped their place of origin and could spread to become a worldwide problem. Second, both organizations use only clinical data-in contrast to epidemiological or laboratory data, which are more timeconsuming to acquire-and are therefore able to quickly track a fast-moving disease outbreak. \"That's an important thing,\" said Jelinek. \"[We have] people dealing with patients, touching patients, talking with patients, and we are trying to benefit from this information as much as possible.\" Finally, GeoSentinel and TropNetEurop have a very fast response time. Whenever one member site sees an unusual case, they immediately notify the rest of the network through the coordinators. If any other sites have had similar cases, the network can quickly establish a pattern and pinpoint where and when the disease originated. In the case of the Eco-Challenge leptospirosis outbreak, the London clinic that treated the first patient immediately alerted the GeoSentinel network. A few hours later, sites in New York, USA, and Toronto, Canada, reported similar cases. By the end of the day, GeoSentinel had reported the leptospirosis outbreak in several electronic forums and informed public health authorities in the home countries of the participants. David Freedman from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA, and colleagues in the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM; Stone Mountain, GA, USA) co-founded GeoSentinel because they wanted a more \"rapid and efficient\" way to keep abreast of infectious diseases. In 1995, Freedman, Phyllis Kozarsky from Emory University in Atlanta, GA, and Martin Cetron from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta) organized a network of nine US travel medicine clinics. After two years of development, GeoSentinel began 855 \u2026 a traveller who returns home with an unusual disease could be the first clue to a new outbreak \u2026both organizations use only clinical data \u2026 and are therefore able to quickly track a fastmoving disease outbreak science & society collecting and analysing data from its member clinics in 1997. Since then it has increased to 33 member sites in North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia, who report every travel-related illness they see to the central database in Atlanta (Fig 1) . In addition, 145 sites around the world participate in the Geo-Sentinel Network Member programme. These clinics report informally on unusual or alarming cases. The main advantage of having geographically distributed sites, according to Freedman, is that people from different parts of the world have different travel patterns. For example, US tourists are more likely to go to the Caribbean, Europeans to Africa, and Australians to Asia.",

In addition, TropNetEurop's members report whenever they see something they consider to be unusual. \"They are experienced clinicians; they have a good grasp of what's normal and what's not normal, and if there is something unusual, they report it immediately by e-mail,\" commented Jelinek.

For Devon Hale, who heads the GeoSentinel site at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, USA, the biggest benefit is the early warning about outbreaks. \"We get alerts and then when we see people from [the affected] areas, we look specifically for the kinds of diseases that have been documented recently,\" he explained. Ron Behrens, who heads a TropNetEurop surveillance site at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in London, UK, considers the greatest success of his network to be the commitment of the member clinicians who \"give up their own personal time and resources to monitor the health and safety of travellers\". B oth networks have also achieved some more tangible successes. In March 2003, the GeoSentinel site in Toronto saw some of the first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outside Asia and quickly notified the network that SARS \"had boarded an airplane\" and was now a global problem, said Freedman. In 1999, TropNetEurop discovered an outbreak of malaria in a region of the Dominican Republic that was thought to be free of the disease. Two years later, they traced an outbreak of African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) to the Serengeti in Tanzania after several tourists returning from the region became ill. On both occasions, there were unreported cases among the local people, and TropNetEurop worked with local health authorities to further control and treat the outbreaks. It also had an important role in treating the European patients, said Jelinek, as member clinics shared medications that were difficult to obtain.",

For example, overseas travel by European tourists has increased, and so has the number of dengue fever cases reported by TropNetEurop sites, said Jelinek. Trop-NetEurop also noted an increase in malaria cases owing to the large influx of immigrants into Europe from regions where the disease is endemic. GeoSentinel reported several disease outbreaks from adventure travels to remote destinations. For example, their sites have reported cases of leishmaniasis in tourists who travelled to Madidi, a new national park in the Bolivian jungle, or who participated in rafting trips in the Costa Rican jungle, said Freedman.",

An avian flu outbreak would cause a significant deviation from this pattern, which GeoSentinel could identify well before a laboratory could make the diagnosis. In anticipation of a possible outbreak, GeoSentinel has increased its monitoring of respiratory illnesses. In addition, the network gained valuable experience during the SARS outbreak. At its peak, GeoSentinel shifted into high gear, updating its analysis of respiratory disease at least once a week and sending bulletins to scientists and clinicians, including all 2,000 members of the ISTM.",

Right now, he continued, \"we are running at our maximum on the few diseases that we currently monitor\". J elinek and Behrens stressed that the biggest challenge facing TropNetEurop in the future is the lack of secure funding. It is a private organization with no ties to any European government, and it relies entirely on the goodwill of its members. \"This is one of the weaknesses [of TropNetEurop],\" said Behrens, \"but it is also one of the strengths in the sense that everybody who [participates] is committed to doing it for the benefit of everybody else.\" Jelinek and Behrens are hopeful that they might eventually receive support from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Solna, Sweden.

GeoSentinel reports informally to the World Health Organization (WHO; Geneva, Switzerland), as does TropNet-Europ, but the WHO has been reluctant to establish closer ties. As Jelinek put it, \"whether [the WHO] acts on [the networks' information] or what they do with it is left to them.\" The WHO's main mission, said Freedman, is to work with national health authorities and it does not want to become too involved with organizations that might be perceived as bypassing those authorities.",

            "text": "doi:10.1038/sj.embor.7400797 I n March this year, the German and then the international press reported that people had become sick after using Magic-Nano products (Kleinmann GmbH; Sonnenbuehl, Germany): aerosols designed to coat glass and ceramic with a protective, dirt-repellent film. Within days, about 100 consumers became ill with symptoms such as coughing, headaches, sleep disruption and vomiting. A small number were hospitalized with pulmonary oedema, but most recovered in a matter of days. The health scare renewed fears of nanotech products in Germany, the only country where the product was marketed, and the press had a field day reporting on the first \"nanorecall\" as authorities pulled the product from the shelves.After investigation, the German government and Kleinmann's supplier, Nanopool GmbH (Schwalbach, Germany), concluded that the problem was not with the nanocomponents of the aerosol. According to Ren\u00e9 Zimmer of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, Germany, \"In the Magic-Nano case, not only no nanoparticles but also no silanes [the substance responsible for creating a nano-structured surface] were inside the bottle.\" Ralf J\u00fcrgens, a senior technologist with Nanopool, said the problem apparently related to pH levels in the aerosol: for still unexplained reasons, the original pH of the formulation was 2.4, which was increased to almost 8 through the addition of NaOH. The silica then sedimented as a white powder on the bottom of the container, \"so the bottles that went to the stores didn't contain any silicon, silanes or silicon dioxide. And without silanes\u2026 there is no nanolayer/nanocoating which turns a substrate into a hydrophobic surface,\" said J\u00fcrgens. He noted that as consumers \"sprayed like hell\", they released an ultrafine aerosol mist containing ethanol and water, which irritated their lungs.",
