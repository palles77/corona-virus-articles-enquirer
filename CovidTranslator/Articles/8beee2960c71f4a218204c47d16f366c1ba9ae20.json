In general, collection of synovial fl uid requires the following materials: 3-to 6-mL syringe, 18-to 22-gauge 1-inch needles, and red-top and/or lavender-top tubes. The amount of restraint and necessary levels of sedation and anesthesia will vary from animal to animal. Enough restraint should be used to minimize struggling during collection. In general, many animals will require at least some degree of sedation or anesthesia. Sterile technique is critical when preparing the site and during aspiration. The fur should be clipped and the area of aspiration scrubbed. Care should be taken not to scratch the articular surface during needle insertion. Palpation and slight fl exion or hyperextension of the joint will help to identify insertion points of the needle. Aspiration sites for specifi c joints are described below. The location of aspiration varies with the joint aspirated. The coxofemoral joint can be aspirated cranioproximal to the trochanter major and slightly ventral and caudal. The stifl e should be fl exed when aspirated. Aspiration can occur medial or lateral to the patellar ligament, midway between the tibia and femur. The tarsocrural joint can be aspirated by hyperextending the joint and inserting the needle lateral or medial to the fi bular tarsal bone. To aspirate the shoulder, insert the needle 1 cm distal and slightly caudal to the acromion process. The elbow should be hyperextended and the needle inserted lateral and along side the olecranon. The carpal joints can be simply aspirated by fl exing the joint and palpating the joint space. The needle should be advanced slowly through the joint capsule into the joint cavity. The amount of fl uid withdrawn depends on the size of animal and joint as well as the amount of C H A P T E R 13",

Synovial fl uid will be aspirated easily if there is a signifi cant effusion but a few drops may be obtained from joints without an increase in synovial fl uid volume. Before removing the needle from the synovial cavity, the plunger of the syringe should be released to remove any negative pressure. Normal synovial fl uid has a gel-like consistency that should not be mistaken for a clot. The gel-like consistency will become less viscous when shaken and return to the original viscosity upon standing; this property is referred to as thixotropy. Clotting is likely to occur if there is signifi cant blood contamination and infl amed joints may form fi brin precipitates or clots. For these reasons, some joint fl uid should be put into an EDTA tube (lavender-top tube). The EDTA will interfere with tests such as the mucin clot test and culturing. The synovial fl uid should be refrigerated if not immediately evaluated. For samples that may be cultured dependent on the cytologic fi ndings, the fl uid should be put into a red-top tube, left in the sterile syringe, and/or placed in an aerobic culturette. There are advocates of putting fl uid in blood culture media to improve the chances for bacterial growth. The laboratory should be contacted for their recommendations. In many smaller animals, only one or two drops of joint fl uid can be obtained. In these cases, immediate preparation of direct smears is the critical component of sample management (refer to Chapter 1). Regardless of the amount of fl uid collected, it usually is advantageous to make direct smears immediately to best preserve cell morphology. These slides should not be refrigerated before staining.",

If only slides are prepared, cell numbers can be roughly estimated by counting the number of cells per low-power fi eld (10\u03eb) and multiplying the count by 100 to give an approximate number per \u03bcl. However estimates from smears are less accurate and tend to be higher than counts from automated counters. Normal joints will have low nucleated cell numbers, usually fewer than 3000 cells/\u03bcl in the dog and 1000 cells/\u03bcl in the cat (Pacchiana et al., 2004) , although more typically the count is fewer than 500 cells/\u03bcl in both species. These counts may vary slightly based on breed, age, body weight, and joint sampled. Consequently, only 1 to 2 cells per high-power fi eld (40\u03eb) will be observed depending on the thickness of the direct smear (see Fig. 13 -2B). Gibson et al. (1999) demonstrated the variability in performing these estimates by a group of clinicians on synovial fl uid. Cells commonly observed in synovial fl uid include lymphocytes, macrophages (clasmatocytes), neutrophils, and, occasionally, synovial lining cells that produce glycosaminoglycans. Neutrophils typically account for less than 5% to 10% of nucleated cells in normal joints. If fl uid is obtained, both direct smears and concentrated preparations can be evaluated. If available, a cytocentrifuge is useful in preparing concentrated preparations. Concentrated preparations can also be prepared by centrifuging the fl uid, pouring of the supernatant, and resuspending the fl uid in one or two drops of supernatant. Smears can then be prepared from this concentrated preparation. Concentrated preparations are useful in synovial fl uid particularly if the cell count is low (\u03fd500 cells/\u03bcl).",

Diagnosis of immune-mediated disease depends not only on demonstrating joint infl ammation, but also on ruling out infection via culture, serology, and/ or empiric therapy. Some cases of immune-mediated disease will have ragocytes ( Fig. 13 -8A-C) or (lupus erythematosus) LE cells ( Fig. 13-8D ). These are infrequent fi ndings and should not be relied on to make a diagnosis of immune-mediated disease.",

Fungal organisms known to cause osteomyelitis include Blastomyces dermatitidis (Fig. 13-16A&B) , Cryptococcus spp., Coccidioides immitis ( Fig. 13-17A&B) , Histoplasma capsulatum, and, less commonly, Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Geomyces spp. (Erne et al., 2007) , and Sporothrix spp. Blastomyces is a round yeast organism with a double-contoured wall and broad-based bud. Coccidioides organisms are large (10 to 100\u03bcm) blue or clear spheres with fi nely granular protoplasm. Histoplasma organisms by comparison are quite small (2 to 4 \u03bcm) and are easily phagocytized by macrophages and can be observed within the cytoplasm of macrophages. The organisms are round with a thin capsule and crescentshaped, eccentrically placed, eosinophilic nuclei. Cryptococcal organisms are round with a narrow-based bud and thick, nonstaining with Wright stain, mucoid capsule.",

            "text": "General cytologic features include round to spin dleshaped cells with basophilic cytoplasm and an eccentrically placed nucleus, with prominent nucleoli (Fig. 13-18A ) (Reinhardt et al., 2005) . Fibrosarcoma and hemangiosarcoma are less likely to have round cells and the majority of the cells are spindle-shaped. Within the background, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, fi brosarcoma, and synovial cell sarcomas can have varying amounts of eosinophilic proteinaceous material ( Fig. 13-18B ). This material can also be observed within the cytoplasm of the cells. Chondrosarcomas can have a large amount of matrix in the background, which results in understaining of the cells (Fig. 13-19A-D) . In spite of these subtle differences, these tumors can be diffi cult to differentiate cytologically and biopsy with histopathology is an important diagnostic tool. Additional cytochemical testing can be done to improve the sensitivity of cytologic diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Staining of the neoplastic cells for alkaline phosphatase activity with nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate toluidine salt (NBT/BCIP) increases the sensitivity and specifi city of differentiating osteosarcoma from other mesenchymal tumors (Barger et al., 2005) . One limitation of this staining technique is that reactive osteoblasts will stain positive as well, so obvious criteria of malignancy must be observed before this test is performed (Fig. 13-20A ). Positive staining is indicated by grayish-black staining of the cytoplasm (Fig. 13-20B ). Previously unstained slides must be used. After staining for alkaline phosphatase activity, cells can be lightly counterstained with a Romanowsky stain to examine the positive cells for the appropriate criteria of malignancy. Lymphoma and plasma cell tumors are considered tumors of bone marrow that can result in bone lysis. The morphology of these cells appears similar to that in other tissues (Fig. 13-21) . Plasma cell tumors produce a characteristic punched-out radiographic appearance. A combination of diagnostic tests is necessary to diagnose the plasma cell tumor as multiple myeloma. In addition to radiographs and cytology, protein electrophoresis of serum and urine are recommended.",

Many tumors can metastasize to bone but the common tumors that metastasize to bone include prostatic, lung, and mammary carcinomas. Identification of metastatic neoplasms can be diffi cult because cytology is often accompanied by reactive osteoblasts and osteoclasts. However, a second population of cells can often be differentiated from the reactive population. Epithelial neoplasms are usually clustered, but when they metastasize they may appear more poorly differentiated ( Fig. 13-22A&B ). Additional stains are very helpful for diagnosis. ",

There are two large, blue, spherical structures in this fi eld (long arrow) that are Coccidioides immitis spherules.

Aspiration of fungal myelitis lesions does not always yield observable organisms (particularly Coccidioides) and if infection is suspected, culture and appropriate serology is indicated. Because of the zoonotic potential of some fungal organisms, extreme care should be taken when culturing these lesions. (Wright; HP oil.)
