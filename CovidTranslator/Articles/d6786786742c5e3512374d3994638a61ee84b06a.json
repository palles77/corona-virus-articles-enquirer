The spike (S) protein gene of TCoV was divided into 10 fragments to identify the antigenic region containing neutralizing epitopes. The expression and antigenicity of S fragments was confirmed by immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assay using an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody or anti-TCoV serum. Polyclonal antibodies raised against expressed S1 (amino acid position 1 to 573 from start codon of S protein), 4F/4R (482-678), 6F/6R (830-1071), or Mod4F/Epi4R (476-520) S fragment recognized native S1 protein and TCoV in the intestines of TCoV-infected turkey embryos. Anti-TCoV serum reacted with recombinant 4F/4R, 6F/6R, and Mod4F/Epi4R in a western blot. The results of a virus neutralization assay indicated that the carboxyl terminal region of the S1 protein (Mod4F/Epi4R) or the combined carboxyl terminal S1 and amino terminal S2 protein (4F/ 4R) possesses the neutralizing epitopes, while the S2 fragment (6F/6R) contains antigenic epitopes but not neutralizing epitopes.",

Increased mortality and uneven flock growth have caused significant economic loss in the turkey industry in the United States [2] , Canada [3, 4] , Europe [5] , and Brazil [6] . Infection with TCoV can induce humoral and cellular immune responses in infected turkeys [7, 8] . TCoV-specific antibodies can be detected as early as 7 days postinfection and reach to a peak at 21 days postinfection. A virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation response in spleen cells from TCoV-infected turkeys is also stimulated significantly [8] . Poults exposed to TCoV were shown to develop a protective immune response against challenge with virulent TCoV 20 days after the first infection, and they showed no clinical signs or shedding of TCoV in feces [7] . Although TCoV was identified as the causative agent in the 1970s, there are still no effective vaccines or treatment to prevent or control TCoV infection.",

In 2009, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) replaced the old classification of coronavirus groups 1, 2, and 3 with the new designation of three genera in the subfamily Coronavirinae [9] . The genus Alphacoronavirus is composed of eight species: Human coronavirus 229E, Human coronavirus NL63, Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Miniopterus bat coronavirus 1 (bat-CoV 1), Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8, Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2, Scotophilus bat coronavirus 512, and Alphacoronavirus 1, which includes transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), and canine coronavirus (CCoV). The genus Betacoronavirus consists of seven species: Betacoronavirus 1, Human coronavirus HKU1, Murine coronavirus, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Pipistrellus bat-CoV HKU5, Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9, and Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4. In addition to the species Avian coronavirus, which includes infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and TCoV, the genus Gammacoronavirus contains the species Beluga whale coronavirus SW1 [9, 10] .",

The S protein is the largest structural protein of coronaviruses and a major inducer of neutralizing antibodies [12, 13] . Antibodies to the S protein expressed in mammalian cells, insect cells, Escherichia coli, or with other viral vectors can neutralize coronavirus in vitro and provide protection against lethal virus challenge [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . The spike structure of coronaviruses is a homotrimer of the S protein, which is composed of an N-terminal subunit (S1) and a C-terminal subunit (S2) [18, 19] . S1 forms the globular head and contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) for the determination of host and tissue tropism [20] [21] [22] [23] . S2 forms the stalk of the spike homotrimer, which anchors it to the coronavirus envelope through a transmembrane domain containing heptad repeat and fusion peptides [24, 25] . Due to variations in the S proteins of different coronaviruses and the methods used to find neutralizing epitopes on the S protein, no conclusion has been made about the locations of neutralizing epitopes except that S1 carries more neutralizing epitopes [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] than S2 [33] [34] [35] [36] in members of many species.",

Most of them have involved the characterization of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) by using competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with a panel of synthesized peptides [29] , by screening phage display libraries [27, 37] , or by characterizing recombinant fragments [28, 30, 33] . In some studies, neutralizing epitopes were found by analyzing neutralizing-MAb-resistant virus variants [31, 32, 38, 39] . Some neutralizing epitopes appear to be composed of a consecutive sequence [29] , and some epitopes can only be brought into close proximity by the folding of the protein [28, 37] . A single amino acid change within an antigenic domain of the S1 protein of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) allows the altered BCoV to escape neutralization [32] , and single amino acid substitutions in the S1 and S2 subunits of SARS-CoV have resulted in a neutralization-escape phenotype [39] . In some studies, the whole sequence of the target protein was scanned to locate antigenic domains [27] , and in other studies, a specific fragment of the target protein for epitope mapping was chosen based on previous references [29] , the reactivity of MAb library [40] or the antigenicity of amino acid sequences calculated by prediction software [28] . Immunodominant fragments containing epitopes have been determined based on their reactivity with mono-or polyclonal antibodies.",

The amino acid (aa) position presented in the figure is from the start codon on the S protein gene of TCoV isolate 540 (GenBank accession number EU022525).

The cells were harvested, and the proteins were extracted using BugBuster reagent with benzonase and lysozyme (EMD, San Diego, CA, USA). Recombinant proteins that had aggregated in inclusion bodies were dissolved in 6 M urea and purified on Ni 2? -charged His-Bind columns (EMD, San Diego, CA, USA). To confirm their size and purity, the purified 4F/4R and 6F/6R S fragments were dissolved in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer with b-mercaptoethanol, subjected to 12.5% glycine SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Protein Mod4F/Epi4R, with an expected size of about 10 kD for the dimer, was treated with reducing sample buffer and loaded into a 16%/6 M urea tricine SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-PBS, stained with turkey anti-TCoV serum diluted at a 1:400 dilution at room temperature for 1 hour, and inoculated with 1:400 of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-turkey IgG (H?L) antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour. The substrate, diaminobenzidine (DAB), was added until the protein bands were visible, and the reaction was stopped by washing the membrane with distilled water.",

The antiserum raised in turkeys using Mod4F/ Epi4R S fragment recognized the denatured S protein and the whole virus in turkey intestines infected with TCoV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to address the S protein domain containing the neutralizing epitopes in TCoV. B-cell antigenic epitopes on the S protein of IBV have been identified, and these epitopes induce virus-neutralizing antibodies and confer protection against virulence viruses [29, 31] . Since the genetic identity between S protein of TCoV and S protein of IBV is low [52] , the information about antigenic epitopes on the S protein of IBV may not applicable for TCoV. From the findings of the present study, the antigenic domain containing the neutralizing epitopes was located at the carboxyl terminus of the S1 protein, similar to what was found with IBV [29] . This implies that the S protein of TCoV must have a structure similar to that of the S protein of IBV, although the amino acid sequences in the antigenic region containing the neutralizing epitopes only shared 30% genetic identity between TCoV and IBV. However, the amino acid identity of the same region is more than 90% among TCoV isolates from Indiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Texas [52] . In a previous antigenicity study of 18 different TCoV isolates from various geographic areas in the U.S., TCoV isolates reacted to polyclonal antibodies to different TCoV isolates and the IBV Massachusetts strain as well as monoclonal antibodies to the M protein of IBV, but not to the S protein of IBV [2] . However, virus crossneutralization assays with TCoV/IN-517/94, TCoV/VA-74/03, and TCoV/TX-1038/98 showed very little (Fig. 4) . Since three different amino acids in TCoV isolates had more cross-neutralization activity than one different amino acid, all three amino acids may be critical residues for neutralization.",

A eukaryotic expression system can provide posttranslational modification to the expressed protein, like glycosylation, and the expressed protein may have a more native conformation than the same protein expressed in a bacterial or insect cell expression system [15] . Therefore, DNA plasmids encoding TCoV S fragments encompassing the entire S protein of TCoV were expressed in COS-7 cells in the present study to ensure the correct conformation and modification of expressed fragments. While it is convenient to screen the antigenicity of S fragments with anti-TCoV serum, the yield of the expressed protein is relatively low, and the cost of production is relatively high for a mammalian cell system compared to bacteria or insect cells. Although the immunogenicity of the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV expressed in the E. coli system was lower than that observed using a mammalian or insect cell system, a high level of neutralizing antibodies was still induced to provide protection against infection by SARS-CoV, especially for the conformation-independent neutralization epitopes present in the receptor domain [15] . By expression in the E. coli system, a sufficient amount of S fragment was produced and used to generate antiserum for ELISA, IFA, and VA assays to characterize each antigenic fragment. Because the Mod4F/Epi4R and 4F/4R S fragments expressed in E. coli showed strong immunogenicity and neutralizing activity, the neutralization epitopes in these antigenic domains are considered conformation and glycosylation independent. Because polyclonal antibodies generated by priming with DNA encoding TCoV 4F/4R or Mod4F/Epi4R S fragment and boosting with the corresponding S fragment expressed in E. coli were able to neutralize TCoV infection in embryonated turkey eggs, such a prime-boost approach may offer a potential vaccination strategy against TCoV infection. It has been shown that subunit vaccine containing a coronaviral S fragment with the neutralizing epitopes induced antibody production, providing protection against IBV in chickens or SARS-CoV in mice [28, 29] . A DNA vaccine encoding a coronaviral S fragment containing neutralizing epitopes has been shown to enhance the induction of a protective immune response [55, 56] . Mice primed intramuscularly with S1 DNA and boosted with recombinant S1 protein produced in E. coli produced a higher titer of neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV infection than a DNA vaccine or S1 protein alone [57] . Therefore, a DNA prime-protein boost regimen may elicit a stronger immune response by combining the advantages of a DNA vaccine and a protective subunit vaccine. While DNA vaccines have the ability to mimic the effects of a live attenuated vaccine and induce humoral and cellular immune responses, highly immunogenic subunit vaccines can overcome the low immunogenicity observed with DNA vaccination [57] [58] [59] .",

Although neutralizing antibodies can be raised using the Mod4F/Epi4R fragment, it remains to be confirmed that this fragment can induce protective immunity and serve as a potential subunit vaccine against TCoV infection. Additional studies are needed to fully understand the neutralization mechanism of anti-TCoV antibodies and the immunoprotective nature of the S protein.",
