            "text": "Identifying recombinant sequences in an era of large genomic databases is challenging as it requires an efficient algorithm to identify candidate recombinants and parents, as well as appropriate statistical methods to correct for the large number of comparisons performed. In 2007, a computation was introduced for an exact nonparametric mosaicism statistic that gave high-precision P values for putative recombinants. This exact computation meant that multiplecomparisons corrected P values also had high precision, which is crucial when performing millions or billions of tests in large databases. Here, we introduce an improvement to the algorithmic complexity of this computation from O(mn 3 ) to O(mn 2 ), where m and n are the numbers of recombination-informative sites in the candidate recombinant. This new computation allows for recombination analysis to be performed in alignments with thousands of polymorphic sites. Benchmark runs are presented on viral genome sequence alignments, new features are introduced, and applications outside recombination analysis are discussed.",

            "text": "Determining whether genomic regions are undergoing homologous recombination is important in all parts of biology and genetics. Indeed, recombination has profound consequences for a population's evolutionary trajectory, and it changes our understanding of the evolutionary history of a population as described through phylogenetics (Schierup and Hein 2000; . Identifying recombination is especially important in large genomic analyses, as the larger the region being analyzed the higher the chance that recombination will be detected even in a small sample. Over the past three decades, methods of identifying recombination from sequence data have focused on detection of clustered polymorphism, excessive homoplasy, low linkage disequilibrium, mosaicism, and incongruent phylogenies . Some of these statistical signals have advantages over others in terms of false positive rate, statistical power, speed, and the size of the data set that can be analyzed. An analysis of sensitivity and specificity can be found in Posada and Crandall (Posada and Crandall 2001) and a guide to choosing an appropriate method for a given data set can be found in Martin et al.

            "text": "In modern sequence analysis, a major challenge in recombination detection is the size of the data sets themselves. Beyond the computational burden, critical but often underappreciated statistical issues arise through the extremely large number of compared nucleotide sequence patterns. With this many comparisons being performed, truly nonrecombinant sequences can exhibit nucleotide patterns that appear recombinant by chance. For this reason, statistical corrections for multiple comparisons are essential to guard against calling spurious recombinants. In an algorithm called 3SEQ, Boni et al. (2007) presented an exact mosaicism statistic for calling recombinants. Critically, the exactness of the computation (e.g., calculating P values to a precision of 10 \u00c020 or 10 \u00c030 ) allows these mosaic signals to remain statistically significant, even when billions of comparisons are being performed and adjusted for multiple comparison. This means that the exact mosaicism statistic implemented in the 3SEQ software maintains good power properties even on large data sets when statistical correction factors for multiple comparisons are on the order of 10 10 or more.",

Below each set of axes, the 30 red bars and 30 blue bars show positions on a genome (informative sites) where a putative recombinant sequence is identical to parent P but different from parent Q (blue bars), or identical to parent Q but different from parent P (red bars). Each blue site can be mapped to an up-step in a random walk and each red site can be mapped to a down-step in a random walk, and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the space of informative-site arrangements and the space of hypergeometric random walks. (A) A random arrangement of informative sites, which does not visually suggest that the sequence is a mosaic of putative parents P and Q. The arrangement of sites maps to a random walk which stays fairly close to the horizontal axis. This walk's maximum descent is eight steps, and $54% of HGRWs with 30 up-steps and 30 down-steps have a maximum descent of eight steps or greater. (B) A nonrandom arrangement of informative sites that clearly suggests that the candidate sequence is a mosaic of the two parental sequences P and Q.

            "text": "The 3SEQ maximum descent statistic describes clustering patterns in sequences of binary outcomes, and is therefore not confined to recombination analysis. The statistic can be viewed as a generalization of the Mann-Whitney U statistic, in the sense that outcomes of one type (of a binary outcome variable) do not necessarily have to cluster or rank at the beginning or end of a sequence of data points. The maximum descent of a HGRW can be used to describe the clustering of one particular binary outcome in the middle of a sequence of binary outcomes; in other words, it is a 1D nonparametric clustering statistic. In recombination analysis, this is the clustering of one kind of informative site among all the informative sites (Han et al. 2010) . To make use of this statistic easier for those working outside the field of recombination, we developed a web calculator ( fig. 2 ) that computes exact P values for clustering in a sequence of binary outcomes, available at http://mol.ax/delta. For example, the sequence \"AAAAABB BBABBBABBBAAAA\" can be typed in and the calculator reports that the clustering of Bs in the middle of the sequence is significant at P \u00bc 0.0055. We list two practical example uses of our nonparametric clustering statistic. First, seasonality can be assessed nonparametrically. If a particular population behavior or climatic characteristic (e.g., rain or no rain) can be noted to occur or not occur every day, then an ordered sequence of the days in the year will show if the occurrence of one of the behaviors is clustered and thus if this feature was seasonal in that one year. As a second example, when a process is expected to behave at an intermediate range or when an observation is expected to be made at intermediate values only, this pattern can be tested for nonparametrically. Dengue virus does not cause severity for all ages equally. One's first dengue infection, occurring during childhood, is typically nonsevere; secondary infections, seen in older children and teenagers, have a higher chance of severity, whereas tertiary and subsequent infections, those that would occur in older age groups, are thought to be rare and/or subclinical (Gubler 1998; Wikramaratna et al. 2010) . Thus, disease severity in a surveillance system should be seen in the intermediate age ranges, and this can be tested for nonparametrically by noting if each age band is overrepresented or underrepresented in the pool of patients experiencing dengue-like severe disease in a hospital. In fact, since all that is required here is a symptoms description, the identification of a vulnerable age range can be done for any set of symptoms.",

Table 1 shows the results of all runs. Note that because 3SEQ evaluates all triplets in a data set, the run time of the algorithm scales as the cube of the number of sequences and linearly with the alignment length. As informative sites can sometimes be clustered in short regions of the genome, 3SEQ will report these short segments as recombinant. For this reason, an additional column is included in table 1 showing the number of sequences that were identified as recombinant with both inherited regions being longer than 500 nt; if one of the recombinant regions is very short, it is difficult to confirm the recombination results with a phylogenetic analysis of the two identified parental segments.",

Both of these runs took <30 s. The genomic alignments of MERS and Zika virus contained 1,150 and 2,792 polymorphic sites, respectively, and >99.9% triplets were able to be tested for mosaicism with exact P values. These runs took <2 min. As expected from a recent analysis by Dudas and Rambaut (Dudas and Rambaut 2015) , the MERS sequence data set was highly recombinant, with 100 out of 164 sequences being identified as such. For Zika, 6 out of 157 virus sequences were identified as recombinant, consistent with earlier analyses supporting the presence of recombination in the evolutionary history of Zika (Faye et al. 2014; Zhu et al. 2016) ; details of the recombinants, parents, and breakpoints are included in the Supplementary Material online. The Ebola virus and dengue virus alignments each contained around 1,000 sequences. The Ebola virus data showed no evidence of recombination. The dengue alignment was the most diverse of all the tested data sets with 6,151 polymorphic sites; 99.4% of the triplets in this data set were able to be evaluated with exact P values. A total of 36 out of 1,108 dengue sequences were identified as recombinant (see Supplementary Material online). Several previous analyses of dengue virus have shown evidence for intraserotype recombination in dengue Worobey et al. 1999; Uzcategui et al. 2001; Aaskov et al. 2007; Waman et al. 2016 Waman et al. , 2017 . The results presented here, as well as those of Waman et al. (2017) , suggest that recombination in dengue is infrequent.",

The size of modern data sets presents two challenges here. First, as the number of available sequences increases, the choice for phylogenetic inference tools drifts to more approximate methods, as thorough explorations of tree space become computationally expensive for large numbers of sequences. This reduces our confidence in phylogenetic incongruence signals that we observe in these data. Second, genome-level analyses in highly recombining organisms are likely to result in a subdivision of the genome into many nonrecombinant blocks. Inferring phylogenies for all blocks individually will be computationally expensive, as will the subsequent analysis of identifying specific phylogenetic incongruences among the trees. The next generation of recombination detection methods should focus on these computational challenges.",
