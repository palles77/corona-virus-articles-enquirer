Here we demonstrate the significant antiviral role of PKR against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and report that FMDV infection inhibits PKR expression and activation in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. The viral nonstructural protein 3 C proteinase (3C pro ) is identified to be responsible for this inhibition. However, it is independent of the well-known proteinase activity of 3C pro or 3C pro -induced shutoff of host protein synthesis. We show that 3C pro induces PKR degradation by lysosomal pathway and no interaction is determined between 3C pro and PKR. Together, our results indicate that PKR acts an important antiviral factor during FMDV infection, and FMDV has evolved a strategy to overcome PKR-mediated antiviral role by downregulation of PKR protein.",

FMDV is the causative agent of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) that causes highly contagious viral disease of cloven-hoofed animals (Grubman and Baxt, 2004) . The outbreak of FMD often results in severe economic consequences due to its impact on trade and the slaughtering of large amounts of animals (Jamal and Belsham, 2013) . The genome of FMDV is a positive-strand RNA of~8.5 kb encoding a large polyprotein. The viral leader proteinase (L pro ), 2 A protein, and 3 C proteinase (3C pro ) subsequently cleaves the polyprotein to yield mature structural and nonstructural proteins . L pro and 3C ro are multifunctional proteins. In addition to the vital roles in processing of the polyprotein precursor, it is well-known that L pro and 3C ro are significantly involved in the viral antagonistic activity against host antiviral responses (Lawrence et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015; Stenfeldt et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "The interferon-induced double-strand RNA activated protein kinase (PKR) plays important roles in host defense against viral infection. PKR is a serine-threonine kinase that constitutively expresses in mammalian cells (Habjan et al., 2009; Nallagatla et al., 2011) . As an antiviral factor, PKR can be induced by IFN treatment and is activated by binding of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or the PKR activator (PACT) protein. Activation results in PKR phosphorylation and subsequently phosphorylates the \u03b1 subunit of the eIF2 translation initiation factor (eIF2\u03b1), blocks cellular and viral protein synthesis, thereby interfering with viral transcription or translation in infected cells (Nallagatla et al., 2011) . To disrupt or antagonize antiviral effects of PKR, various viruses have evolved different strategies to inhibit PKR activation. Influenza A virus non-structural (NS1) protein interacts with PKR or directly binds the double-stranded RNA to block PKR activation and counteract PKR-mediated inhibition of viral replication (Bergmann et al., 2000; Li et al., 2006; Lu et al., 1995) . Hepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosome entry site binds to PKR in competition with PKR ligands and prevents the phosphorylation and activation of PKR (Vyas et al., 2003) . Our previous study found that FMDV infection leads to a significant decrease of PKR protein as infection progresses (Li et al., 2016b) . It implies that PKR may suppress FMDV infection and the virus decreases PKR protein expression to block PKR activation and antagonize the antiviral response.",

This indicates the important role of PKR in inhibition of FMDV replication. It was therefore necessary to investigate the state of PKR during FMDV infection. We first investigated the kinetics of PKR to determine the state of PKR in FMDV-infected cells. PK-15 cells were infected by FMDV at an MOI of 0.5, and the dynamics of PKR were examined. It showed that the mRNA level of PKR was significantly upregulated starting at 6 h post-infection (hpi), and gradually increased as the infection progressed; no significant changes in PKR mRNA expression levels were observed in the mock-infected cells (Fig. 1A) . To explore the correlation between PKR expression and FMDV replication, we also determined viral RNA levels. No viral RNA was detectable in mockinfected cells. In FMDV-infected cells, the viral RNA was detectable at 3 hpi, and gradually increased, similar to the increase of PKR (Fig. 1A) . The state of PKR protein was also examined at different time points after FMDV infection, which showed that FMDV infection resulted in a significant loss of PKR protein. As shown in Fig. 1B , the amounts of PKR began to decrease at 6 hpi; and by 18 hpi, the amount of PKR almost could not be detected by western blotting. These results suggested that FMDV infection triggers PKR mRNA expression, while PKR protein levels are gradually reduced as infection progresses.",

Therefore, we also investigated the state of PKR phosphorylation in FMDVinfected cells. The PK-15 cells were inoculated with 0.5 MOI of FMDV and harvested at 0, 3, 6, 12 or 18 hpi. Western blotting result showed that the level of p-PKR in FMDV-infected cells is significantly lower than that in the mock-infected cells (Fig. 3A) . To further confirm this observation, we also investigated the effect of FMDV infection on poly(I:C)-induced PKR phosphorylation. poly(I:C) is an artificial dsRNA that can significantly induce the activation of PKR. PK-15 cells were transfected with poly(I:C) for 6 h, and then infected with FMDV for 12 h, the p-PKR levels were then assessed by western blotting. Transfection of poly(I:C) significantly induced PKR phosphorylation in the mock-infected cells. However, in the FMDVinfected cells, PKR phosphorylation was significantly blocked (Fig. 3B ). The phosphorylation of the PKR substrate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF-2\u03b1) in the FMDV-infected cells was also evaluated; the relative levels of the phosphorylated eIF-2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1) were also reduced after FMDV infection, and the total eIF2\u03b1 level had minimum change (Fig. 3A) .

The expression of 3C pro had no significant affection on PKR mRNA expression (Fig. 5A ). This indicates that 3C pro -induced PKR reduction was not due to reduced synthesis of PKR mRNA. 3C pro is a viral proteinase that can directly induce the cleavage of various host proteins. The kinetics of 3C pro -induced reduction of PKR were subsequently examined to detect any PKR cleavage product(s). As shown in Fig. 5B , 3C pro gradually induced the decrease of PKR as time progressed; however, no cleavage bands were observed. This suggests that 3C pro does not induce the cleavage of PKR. It is well known that 3C pro induces the cleavage of the eukaryotic cellular translation initiation factor 4 G (eIF4G) and results in a so-called \"shut-off\" of host cell protein synthesis. To determine whether the reduction of PKR was completely due to this shut-off effect, a translational inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) was used to evaluate this correlation. The PK-15 cells were mock-treated or treated with CHX for 0, 6, 12 or 18 h, the PKR levels were detected by western blotting. The inhibition of host protein synthesis did not resulted in detectable reduction of PKR for 18 h (Fig. 5C ). This indicates that FMDV-or 3C pro -induced reduction of PKR protein levels is not related to the well-characterized blocking effect of 3C pro on cellular translation (viral host cell shutoff).",

As show in Fig. 7A , incubation of CQ and NH4Cl significantly restored PKR levels in FMDV-infected cells. However, MG132 and Z-VAD-FMK had no such effect on PKR restoration. The effect of these inhibitors on 3 C pro -induced decrease of PKR was also evaluated by western blotting, which indicated that incubation of CQ and NH4Cl also restored PKR levels in Flag-3C-tranfected cells, and MG132 and Z-VAD-FMK had no such effect (Fig. 7B) . Taken together, these results suggest that FMDV 3C pro induces PKR degradation through the lysosome pathway.",

            "text": "FMDV is one of the most concerned animal virus due to its enormous potential to cause epidemics and economic losses (Kitching, 2005) . FMDV infection strongly suppresses host innate antiviral responses by various strategies (Liu et al., 2015) . 3C pro , as an important viral proteinase, is responsible for inducing cleavage of several viral polyprotein and has the ability to antagonize host antiviral effects . For instance, 3C pro specifically incises host translation initiation factor eIF4G, resulting in shut-off of host proteins synthesis (Belsham et al., 2000) . 3C pro also induces the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) essential modulator (NEMO) and karyopherin \u03b11 cleavage to impair innate antiviral response (Du et al., 2014b; Wang et al., 2012a) . PKR, as a viral RNA sensor, plays important roles in host antiviral response (Balachandran et al., 2000; Dabo and Meurs, 2012 ). It has previously been shown that incubation of a PKR inhibitor, 2-AP, significantly increases the yield of FMDV in PK and EBK cells, suggesting an important antiviral role of PKR against FMDV (Chinsangaram et al., 2001) . Our data here demonstrate that overexpression of PKR also suppresses FMDV, and FMDV infection degrades PKR to abate the antiviral action of PKR. This indicates that PKR functions as an antiviral factor during FMDV infection, and the virus has developed strategies to antagonize PKR-mediated antiviral action.",

            "text": "The importance of PKR in antiviral defense has been supported by various viruses, and PKR regulates diverse cellular pathways to perform its antiviral action (Balachandran et al., 2000; Garcia et al., 2006 Garcia et al., , 2007 Nakamura et al., 2010) . Meanwhile, most viruses have developed mechanisms to block or impair PKR-induced antiviral response by using delicate strategies; the well-known strategies include expression of dsRNA-binding proteins or small RNAs which compete with PKR for its ligand, interaction with PKR by viral proteins, expression of a decoy substrate, or dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (Garcia et al., 2007; Habjan et al., 2009; Langland et al., 2006; Lussignol et al., 2013; Xiao et al., 2016) . For example, the accessory protein 4a of Middle East respiratory coronavirus prevents PKR activation by sequestering its ligand, dsRNA (Rabouw et al., 2016) . NS5A protein of HCV directly interacts with PKR to inhibit PKR dimerization and activation (Tan et al., 1998) . To our knowledge, rift valley fever virus (RVFV), Mengovirus and poliovirus are the only identified viruses that possess the activity to degrade PKR. NSs protein of RVFV specifically induces PKR degradation via the proteasome pathway (Habjan et al., 2009) ; the responsible viral factor for Mengovirus-and poliovirus-induced PKR degradation has not been clarified (Black et al., 1989; Feng et al., 2012) . We report here that FMDV infection induces PKR degradation and 3C pro is the antagonistic factor responsible for this degradation. 3C pro -induced cleavage of eIF4G blocks the expression of many host proteins (Belsham et al., 2000) . However, we found that 3C pro specifically reduces PKR protein levels after inhibition of cellular translational function, indicating that 3C pro -induced reduction of PKR protein levels is not totally related to the well-characterized blocking effect of 3C pro on cellular translation. L pro also induces the cleavage of host eIF4G to inhibit host protein synthesis (Kirchweger et al., 1994) ; however, we observed that over-expression of L pro had no detectable effect on PKR expression (Fig. 4A) ; it was similar to the observation in the cells treated with a translational inhibitor CHX (Fig. 5C) , and the long half-life of PKR may result in this minimum change. This also explains why L pro does not degrade PKR. The co-transfection of the plasmids expressing other FMDV proteins Fig. 6 . 3C pro does not interact with PKR and the protease activity is not essential for 3C pro to induce PKR reduction. (A) HEK293T cells grown in the 10-cm dish were co-transfected with Myc-PKR (5 \u03bcg) and vector, Flag-L or Flag-3C plasmids (5 \u03bcg) for 36 h. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-Myc antibody and subjected to western blotting. (B) HEK293T cells grown in the 10-cm dish were co-transfected with Myc-PKR (5 \u03bcg) and vector, Flag-L or Flag-3C plasmids (5 \u03bcg) for 36 h. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Flag antibody and subjected to western blotting. (C) HEK293T cells were co-transfected with 2 \u03bcg of Myc-PKR plasmids and 3 \u03bcg of vector plasmids or various 3 C mutant plasmids for 36 h. The expression of Myc-PKR and host protein NEMO was detected by western blotting. Relative level of Myc-PKR was indicated in folds below the images after normalization with \u03b2-actin.",

However, the level of PKR phosphorylation in the mengo-Zn-infected cells is strongly induced even with reduced PKR levels (Rabouw et al., 2016) . Poliovirus infection also triggers PKR phosphorylation, even though PKR is significantly degraded (Black et al., 1989) .

It indicates that PKR degradation by FMDV 3C pro occurs in a specific manner and not by the proteinase activity. The mutation of the catalytic sites of 3C pro further confirmed this characteristic. No direct interaction was identified between PKR and 3C pro , the lysosomal pathway was determined to be involved in 3C pro -induced PKR reduction. Many RNA viruses induce degradation of host cell proteins to facilitate virus replication. Such as, in influenza A virus infection, the viral nonstructural protein NS1 induces lysosomal degradation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B to promote virus replication (Wang et al., 2014) ; HIV Nef protein promotes lysosomal targeting of host CD4 receptor to facilitate release of newly produced viral particles (Amorim et al., 2014) . How 3C pro induces PKR degradation in the lysosomes without a direct interaction remains unknown. Experiments to further characterize the degradation mechanism are currently under way.",
