An antibody specific for DPAP B recognizes a 120-kD glycoprotein in yeast that behaves like an integral membrane protein in that it is not removed from membranes by high pH Na2COs treatment. Inspection of the deduced amino acid sequence of DPAP B reveals a hydrophobic domain near the NH2 terminus that could potentially span a lipid bilayer. The in vitro enzymatic activity and apparent molecular weight of DPAP B are unaffected by the allelic state of PEP4, a gene essential for the proteolytic activation of a number of soluble vacuolar hydrolases. DPAP B is synthesized as a glycosylated precursor that is converted to the mature 120-kD species by carbohydrate addition. The precur-J. H. Rothman's present address is",

Cell. 21:205-215) that are blocked at the ER (sec18) or Golgi apparatus (sec7), but not at secretory vesicles (secl). Immunolocalization of DPAP B in wild-type or secl mutant cells shows that the protein resides in the vacuolar membrane. However, it is present in nonvacuolar compartments in sec18 and sec7 cells, confirming that the delivery of DPAP B is blocked in these mutants. Interestingly, DPAP B appears to stain the nuclear envelope in a sec18 mutant, which is consistent with the accumulation of DPAP B in the ER membrane at the restrictive temperature. These results suggest that soluble and membrane-bound vacuolar proteins use the same stages of the secretory pathway for their transport.",

A 24-bp segment located from -210 to -187 relative to the putative translation initiating codon may function as a reiterated TATA-Iike box for initiation of transcription. An identical sequence is found in a similar location upstream of the yeast STE3 gene (Hagen et al., 1986) .

Thus, the predicted topology of DPAP B is that of a type II (or group B; Fig. 3 B) integral membrane protein (Garoff, 1985; Singer et al., 1987) , with an NH2-terminal cytoplasmic do-main and a lumenal COOH terminus. The hydrophobic domain presumably functions as both an ER-targeting signal and a membrane anchor, as is true of other type II integral membrane proteins, such as the neuraminidase of influenza virus (Bos et al., 1984) and the transferrin receptor (Zerial et al., 1986) . Further support for this disposition of DPAP B in the membrane is the observation that DPAP B is a glycoprotein (see below), and that all sites for N-linked glycosylation are included in the COOH-terminal domain, which therefore must be the lumenal domain.",

Suarez Rendueles et al. (1981) showed that total DPAP (DPAP A and DPAP B) activity was similar in a wild-type strain and a pep4-3 mutant. To examine further the effect of a pep4 mutation on DPAP B, enzyme assays and immunoprecipitations of DPAP B were performed using isogenic PEP4 andpep4-A2 strains. No significant effect on the activity of DPAP B was detected in the pep4-A2 strain as compared to the PEP4 strain (data not shown), confirming that DPAP B is not synthesized as an inactive precursor. This result is consistent with the observation that DPAP B which had accumulated in the ER ofsecl8 cells (see below) was enzymatically active (data not shown). Fig. 7 shows that DPAP B immunoprecipitated from isogenic PEP4 and pep4-A2 strains comigrates before and after digestion with endo E although a minor breakdown product, not seen in the pep4-A2 strain, was detected in the PEP4 strain after endo F treatment.

Wild-type cells contained the 120-kD mature form of DPAP B at either 34\u00b0C (Fig. 8 ) or 38\u00b0C (data not shown), secl cells also contained mature DPAP B, whereas secl8 cells accumulated the DPAP B precursor. Thus, the precursor form seen after a short labeling period (Fig. 4, lane 3) is the ER-form of DPAP B. The sec7 strain accumulated a mixture of core-glycosylated and mature forms of DPAP B. This suggests that the block in transport is at an early stage within the Golgi apparatus such that DPAP B is only partially processed by the mannosyl transferases (Runge, 1988) . This phenotype is similar to that seen with invertase, which accumulates as a heterogeneous population of core-and hyper-glycosylated forms in sec7 cells at the restrictive temperature (Esmon et al., 1981) . The accumulation of the DPAP B precursor in secl8 and secTcells was thermoreversible: after labeling cells at the restrictive temperature, shifting the cultures to 23\u00b0C, and chasing for 3 h in the absence of new protein synthesis, DPAP B was completely converted to the mature 120-kD form (data not shown). This result, whichwas also observed with CPY accumulated in secl8 and sec7 cells (Stevens et al., 1982) , suggests that the accumulated DPAP B precursor resides early in the pathway and is able to transit the Golgi apparatus upon shifting to the permissive temperature.",

For these studies, DPAP B synthesis was placed under the control of the inducible GAL/promoter (Johnston and Davis, 1984) i allowing analysis of nascent DPAP B synthesis after shifting to the nonpcrmissive temperature. A multicopy plasmid conraining the GALI-DAP2 gene fusion was transformed into wild-type and sec mutant strains which had been disrupted at the chromosomal DAP2 locus. Transformed strains were then shifted to the restrictive temperatures in galactosecontaining media and incubated for 2 h. This procedure typically resulted in a 4-10-fold induction of DPAP B activity relative to a strain containing a single genomic copy of DAF2 (data not shown). No DPAP B activity or antigen was detected when these strains were grown in the absence of galactose (data not shown). The cells were fixed in formaldehyde, spheroplasted, and incubated with affinity-purified DPAP B Figure 9 . DPAP B localization by immunofluorescence microscopy. Strains JHRY20-1A (SEC*), CJRY21-3BA1 (secl8), CJRY23-2AA1 (sec7), and CJRY22-6BA I (secl), each containing the GAL1-DAP2 gene fusion on a multicopy plasmid, were shifted to their respective nonpermissive temperatures and treated for induction of the GAL/promoter for 2 h as described in Materials and Methods. The cells were fixed, converted to spheroplasts, and stained with DAPI and afffinity-purified DPAP B antibody. Cells were viewed by Nomarski differential interference optics (A, D, G, and J), and under DAPI (B, E, H, and K) and FITC (C, E I, and L) excitation wavelengths. antibody, followed by FITC-conjugated sheep anti-goat antibody (Fig. 9 ). Nomarski optics revealed the position of the vacuole, and the nucleus was localized by DAPI staining. Wild-type cells grown at either 34\u00b0C (Fig. 9 , A-C) or 38\u00b0C (data not shown) exhibited fluorescent labeling of DPAP B around the perimeter of the vacuole, consistent with the fact that DPAP B is a vacuolar membrane protein. A similar labeling pattern was seen in secl cells (Fig. 9 , J-L), indicat-ing that the secl block is later in the secretory pathway than the point at which sorting of vacuolar membrane proteins occurs. The staining pattern seen in sec18 (Fig. 9 , D-F) and sect (Fig. 9 , G-I) cells was distinctly nonvacuolar. Interestingly, the sec18 strain showed DPAP B staining around the nucleus, apparently in the nuclear envelope, which probably reflects the fact that the nuclear envelope and the ER are continuous membranes. These data indicate that transport of DPAP B to the vacuole is prevented in sec mutants that are blocked in protein transport early in the secretory pathway.",

Based on this assumption, mutations have been isolated that result in secretion of mature ct-factor in a stel3 background.

The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a protein of 931 amino acids with striking similarities to DPAP B (Fig. 10) . Both proteins are predicted to have type II membrane topologies, with short cytoplasmic tails and ,0800 amino acid lumenal domains. The lumenal domains of these proteins are very similar; in particular, the COOH-terminal 240 amino acids are 48 % identical, presumably reflecting the similar enzymatic functions of these proteins in vitro and in vivo (Julius et al., 1983) . However, the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains are unrelated, possibly reflecting the different subcellular addresses of DPAPA and DPAP B. This sorting signal hypothesis can be tested by exchanging these segments of the two proteins, an approach that has been useful in studying the sorting of membrane proteins in polarized cells (Roth et al., 1987; McQueen et al., 1987) .",
