The major challenges for anti-HBV therapy are to overcome the low efficacy, high rate of drug resistance and adverse effects of currently available drugs [1, 2] . Hence, there is an urgent need for developing new therapeutic strategies. One potential strategy is RNA interference (RNAi), a gene silencing regulatory mechanism present virtually in all eukaryotes, which employs double-stranded RNA molecules to degrade, or functionally inactivate, target RNAs in a sequence-specific manner [3] [4] [5] . Numerous studies have shown that replication of various viruses including HIV-1 [6] [7] [8] , HCV [9] [10] [11] , HSV-1 [12] , SARSassociated coronavirus [13] as well as HBV [14] [15] [16] [17] , can be suppressed by RNAi, using synthetic siRNAs and plasmid-based shRNAs. However, due to their short halflife and low transfection efficiency, clinical application is limited. In this regard, non-replicating recombinant viral vectors with high delivery efficiency may provide a novel antiviral option [18] [19] [20] .",

            "text": "HIV-1-derived LVs, intensively optimized during the last decade, are one of the most promising systems. They not only provide a non-pathogenic and latent infection by integrating into the host genome, but also demonstrate high transduction efficiency in both dividing and non-dividing cells with persistent transgene expression [21] [22] [23] . Currently LV-based vaccines have already been tested in preclinical trials for protection against or treatment of HIV-1 [9] . Moreover, several routes of LVs administration invoking sustained anti-HIV immune responses have been explored in mice [24, 25] . These findings suggest that the LVs may also be suitable delivery vectors for gene therapy in antiviral treatment. In addition, a novel tetracycline, or doxycycline (DOX), respectively, regulated RNAi system based on LVs has been developed to avoid the undesirable toxicity that may be induced by long-term shRNA expression [26, 27] . In this system, a fusion protein (tTR-KRAB) of the DNA binding domain of the Escherichia coli tetracycline repressor (tTR) and the approximately 75 amino acid KRAB repressor is likewise delivered by an LV, LV-tTR-KRAB. KRAB suppresses transcription from both RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase III promoters within a distance of up to 3 kb from its binding site [28, 29] . The mechanism is not entirely known but seems to involve local heterochromatin formation and histone deacetylation, and/or an indirect influence of the arrangement of the basal transcription machinery [30] [31] [32] . When a promoter is juxtaposed with tet operator (tetO) sequences, as in the LV-HBV-shRNA vectors used in this study, the tTR-KRAB protein is specifically targeted to this promoter by the tTR domain and represses shRNA transcription in the absence of DOX. Conversely, addition of DOX releases tTR-KRAB from tetO, thus permitting shRNA expression [26] (Fig. 1b) .",

DR1 is an essential cis-element for replication; the 3 0 DR1 copy on the pregenomic (pg) RNA contains the acceptor site for the DNA primer generated during initiation of reverse transcription at 5 0 e [33] [34] [35] . CP controls transcription [36, 37] of the pgRNA which serves as template for HBV DNA synthesis and also as mRNA for polymerase and core protein [35, 38] , and of the precore RNA from which the precore protein precursor of secreted HBeAg [39] is translated. Moreover, the CP region overlaps with the / cis-element which facilitates first-strand template switch and initiation of minus-strand DNA synthesis [40, 41] . The RT region of the HBV polymerase is essential for reverse transcriptase activity [42]; on top, the same nucleotide sequence overlappingly encodes part of the S gene. Not the least, the suitability as RNAi targets of DR1 and the specific RT region chosen was already demonstrated using simple shRNA expression plasmids [43] . Therefore, we explored the feasibility of exploiting LVs for efficient delivery of shRNAs against the DR1, CP, and RT regions, and assessed their antiviral efficacies in the stably HBV-transfected human hepatoma cell line HepG2.2.15. Subsequently, the anti-DR1 shRNA, exerting the strongest interference, was selected to further evaluate its antiviral efficacy in the DOX-controllable system. As shown below, antiviral activity was strictly DOXdependent, allowing to profoundly affect HBV gene expression and replication in a regulated fashion.",

It is therefore widely used as an in vitro model for HBV replication and appeared well suited for the current study. To this end, the cells were seeded at a density of 1 9 10 5 cells per well of a 6-well plate and inoculated 24 h later with the respective LVs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10; vector titers in the stocks had been determined using the LV built-in GFP to microscopically count the number of positive cells in dependence of the applied vector stock volume. After overnight incubation, the vector-containing media were replaced by fresh media, and data were collected at the time points indicated below. The GFP assay showed that routinely[95 % of the cells were successfully transduced under the above described conditions. shRNA impact on secreted HBV antigens As an initial test for the functionality of the shRNAs, HepG2.2.15 cells were transfected with the pSuper-HBV-shRNA plasmids and the negative control vector pSuper-shRNA-NC; untreated HepG2.2.15 cells served as reference. HBsAg and HBeAg in the supernatants after 24, 48 and 72 h were then determined by ELISA. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 , shRNA3 achieved the strongest reductions, followed by shRNA2 and shRNA1; no significant differences between cells receiving the negative control plasmid and untransfected cells were seen. HBsAg levels were maximally reduced by 70-80 %, HBeAg levels by 20-30 %. These data confirmed that the HBV-specific shRNAs acted as intended. Higher levels of inhibition would not be expected because all cells contain integrated HBV but only a fraction of them are transfected with the shRNA plasmid.",

To monitor a potential direct (not tTR-KRAB) mediated effect of DOX on the shRNA vector, the fourth group was transduced with just LV-HBV-shRNA3 and cultured with DOX. Lastly, a potential impact of DOX on the HepG2.2.15 cells or HBV replication in the cells was addressed by culturing naive HepG2.2.15 cells in DOX containing medium. We then tested as before for secreted HBsAg and HBeAg, core protein and viral replicative DNA intermediates in intracellular nucleocapsids . Fully consistent with the previous data, LV-HBV-shRNA3 on its own caused a strong reduction in HBsAg and less pronounced reduction in HBeAg (Fig. 7) . This was not affected by the presence of DOX, which had also no impact on naive HepG2.2.15 cells. Co-transduction of LV-HBV-shRNA3 and LV-tTR-KRAB in the absence of DOX completely blocked the antiviral effect, giving very similar ELISA values as the untreated cells. The presence of DOX, however, completely restored HBsAg and HBeAg suppression to levels indistinguishable from those achieved with the shRNA3 vector alone. Suppression of secreted antigens in the presence of DOX, and inhibition of suppression in its absence, were largely maintained over 2 weeks. The trend toward slightly less efficient HBsAg suppression at the late time points was consistent with the results obtained by transduction of only the LV-HBV-shRNA vectors (Fig. 2a) and may reflect a slow selection of cells that produce less shRNA.",

Although HBV is a DNA virus, RNA plays a key role in its replication as template for generation of new DNA genomes by reverse transcription. Therefore, RNAi can not only act on the viral mRNAs and prevent generation of viral proteins but directly interfere with HBV replication. This has been confirmed by several studies employing synthetic siRNAs and plasmid-based shRNAs targeting different regions of the HBV genome, both in vitro and in hydrodynamically transfected mice in vivo [53] [54] [55] . However, due to the short half-life of siRNAs and limited and variable transfection efficiency of shRNA plasmids, the inhibitory effects are transient, lasting only a few days, limiting their application for long-term gene silencing in mammalian systems [56] . This issue is partially overcome using adenovirus-or retrovirus-based vectors for shRNA expression which have successfully been applied to suppress HBV replication [49, 57] . However, adenoviral vectors do not integrate, are likely to be lost during cell division, and thus can achieve only transient shRNA expression. Furthermore, adenovirus is a very common human pathogen and in vivo delivery may be hampered by pre-existing host immune responses. Retroviruses, on the other hand, require cell division for integration, and hence are inefficient in transducing genes into non-dividing cells such as quiescent hepatocytes.",

First, they integrate into the host genome, allowing for stable, persistent shRNA expression. Second, they transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells with high efficiency. Third, gene silencing can be regulated by addition of DOX, minimizing potential toxicity induced by long-term shRNA expression, such as induction of interferon responses [58] of ''offtarget'' activities by or complementarity to non-target genes in only six or seven nucleotides of the guide strand [59] . So far, the inducible RNAi system has been applied in different areas including regulation of housekeeping gene expression and antiviral research on HIV-1 [9, 60] . Although lentivirus-mediated RNAi suppression of HBV replication has already been reported [50, 61] , the current study, to our knowledge, is the first to establish the reversible effects of shRNAs on HBV via a drug-regulated lentiviral vector system.",

            "text": "First, our results demonstrate that LV-HBV-shRNA expressed anti-HBV shRNAs can induce efficient gene silencing in vitro. Consistent with the data from cells transfected with the parental pSuper-HBV-shRNA plasmids ( Supplementary Fig. 1) , LV-delivered shRNA2 targeting the CP region and especially shRNA3 targeting the DR1 region were more efficient than shRNA1 directed against the RT region in suppressing HBsAg and HBeAg (Fig. 2 ). However, both the level of inhibition and the duration of the silencing effect were much more pronounced for LV-delivered shRNA; for instance, LV-HBV-shRNA3 suppressed HBsAg production of HBsAg up to 98.5 % at 72 h post-transduction (Fig. 2) , and highly efficient suppression was maintained for 2 weeks (Fig. 7) . The most likely explanation is that transfection reaches only a fraction of the virus producing cells and the non-replicating plasmid is diluted out by cell division. In contrast, transduction by the LVs is highly efficient (around 95 % in our experiments) and the shRNA expression cassettes become stably integrated. The trend toward slightly lower suppression after 1 week may reflect a slow selection of cells with reduced shRNA expression. Overall similar results were observed for secreted HBeAg although suppression was less pronounced than for HBsAg, both in plasmid- transfected and in LV-transduced cell ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). There is no obvious explanation but similar results were reported by Uprichard et al. [49] and Deng et al. [50] . It was suggested that the relative RNAi resistance of the precore mRNA compared to the 2.4 and 2.1 kb mRNAs may be due to a more global protection within RNA-protein complexes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum [49] . An alternative explanation could be that expression of HBeAg in the cell system used is not limited by mRNA levels but by the efficacy of posttranslational steps of protein production. At any rate, the RT-PCR assays (Fig. 3) demonstrated also a strong reduction in the levels of HBV RNA by the LV-HBV-shRNA2 vector (about 77 %) and particularly the LV-HBV-shRNA3 vector (around 95 %), without affecting the b-actin housekeeping gene mRNA. LV-HBV-shRNA1 caused only limited suppression of HBV RNA (30 %) . This is probably due to poor target accessibility [62] , which is affected by RNA structure and protein binding [63] . While these parameters are difficult to assess, the high activity of shRNA3 may relate to the fact that its DR1 target region is present in two copies on the pgRNA (see Fig. 1 ); RNAi targeting either the 5 0 or the 3 0 site would induce their degradation and, for the pgRNA, prevent it from acting as template for reverse transcription.",

Hence, this new system should provide a valuable platform to study the pharmacokinetics of RNA drugs in general, and against HBV in particular. The data also suggest the potential of this system for therapeutic purposes, possibly in combination with conventional anti-HBV drugs such as nucleos(t)ide analogs to a priori reduce viral loads.
