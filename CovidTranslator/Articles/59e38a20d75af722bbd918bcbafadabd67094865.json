            "text": "The complete mitochondrial genome of Acinonyx jubatus was sequenced and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) regions were screened for polymorphisms as candidates for the cause of a neurodegenerative demyelinating disease affecting captive cheetahs. The mtDNA reference sequences were established on the basis of the complete sequences of two diseased and two nondiseased animals as well as partial sequences of 26 further individuals. The A. jubatus mitochondrial genome is 17,047-bp long and shows a high sequence similarity (91%) to the domestic cat. Based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the control region (CR) and pedigree information, the 18 myelopathic and 12 non-myelopathic cheetahs included in this study were classified into haplotypes I, II and III. In view of the phenotypic comparability of the neurodegenerative disease observed in cheetahs and human mtDNA-associated diseases, specific coding regions including the tRNAs leucine UUR, lysine, serine UCN, and partial complex I and V sequences were screened. We identified a heteroplasmic and a homoplasmic SNP at codon 507 in the subunit 5 (MTND5) of complex I. The heteroplasmic haplotype I-specific valine to methionine substitution represents a nonconservative amino acid change and was found in 11 myelopathic and eight non-myelopathic cheetahs with levels ranging from 29% to 79%. The homoplasmic conservative amino acid substitution valine to alanine was identified in two myelopathic animals of haplotype II. In addition, a synonymous SNP in the codon 76 of the MTND4L gene was found in the single haplotype III animal. The amino acid exchanges in the MTND5 gene were not associated with the occurrence of neurodegenerative disease in captive cheetahs. D",

The genetic factors include nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects or derangements in the interaction of the two genomes. Nuclear DNA defects as such cause a large group of neurodegenerative diseases (Jellinger, 2003) . Beyond that, mutated nuclear gene products targeted to mitochondria can affect the organellar function and replication and thus can impair almost any aspect of cellular function and oxidative energy metabolism (Schon and Manfredi, 2003) . The mitochondria harbour the oxidative respiratory system (OXPHOS), and therefore disorders arising from defects in the nucleus and mitochondria encoded subunits of OXPHOS are also referred to as 'mitochondrial' diseases. Since the discovery of these mitochondrial diseases, more than 100 point mutations and innumerable mtDNA rearrangements have been identified as cause for various types of progressive neurodegenerative and multisystemic diseases (DiMauro and Schon, 2001) .",

In view of the phenotypic comparability of the progressive neurodegeneration in the cheetah and human mitochondrial diseases, we investigated whether mutations in the cheetah mtDNA were associated with the myelopathic phenotype. For this purpose we determined the complete mitochondrial genome of two myelopathic and two non-myelopathic cheetahs and selected coding regions as candidate genes for analysis including homo-and heteroplasmic base substitutions and deletions.",

PCR assays of 25 Al contained 60 mM Tris -HCl (pH 8.5), 15 mM (NH4) 2 SO 4 , 0.2 mM dATP, dCTP, dGTP and 0.4 mM dUTP, 300 nM of each primer, 150 nM of the fluorogenic probe, 1.25 units of Taq polymerase, 3.5 mM MgCl 2 and 1.5-Al template DNA. Real-time PCR was performed with the ABI PRISMk Sequencing Detection System 7900 (Applied Biosystems). The threshold cycle (C T ) values, i.e., the C T was defined as the cycle at which an amplification plot reached a significant threshold, were determined using the Sequence Detector 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems). The allele-specific ARMS (Newton et al., 1989) reverse primer was designed to discriminate between the alleles G and A at nt 14,175 (GenBank accession no. AF344830). To further inhibit amplification of the nontarget allele, a mismatch at position 3 from the 3Vend of the primer was arbitrarily introduced. This substitution generating a mismatch with both alleles at this bi-allelic site is printed in capital letter: ARMS (gag ttt taa gtt ttt ggc Aac, 14, 196) . The oligonucleotides TM1 (14,103 -14,122) and TM2 (14,169 -14,149) were used to quantify the total amount of mtDNA. The hydrolysis probe TMP (14,243 -14,267 ) was labelled at the 5Vend with 6-carboxyfluorescein (6FAMk) and at the 3Vend with 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRAk). ARMS allele-specific real-time PCR was performed with 5 min at 95 jC, 40 cycles for 15 s at 95 jC, 30 s at 52 jC and 30 s at 72 jC. To test the reliability of the PCR, each sample was amplified in duplicates with a standard deviation of threshold cycle (C T ) values not exceeding 0.5. Samples with C T values >32 were amplified in quadruplicates and the highest and lowest values were excluded. Each experiment included a standard curve (regression coefficient R 2 >0.991), a non-template control and a nontarget amplification control (NTAC). The NTAC consisted of the synthetic oligonucleotide (14,103 -14,195 ; MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) including the nontarget allele A at nt 14,175 and carrier salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen). The percentage of the G allele at 14,175 was determined by the ''Comparative C T method'' (ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system, Applied Biosystems, 1997) using the equation: Heteroplasmy = 100% / (1+E) DDC T , where the efficiency (E) = 10 \u00c0 1/s \u00c0 1. The slope (s) being a measure for the efficiency of the PCR reaction is determined by the standard curve y = sx + b. ARMS allele-specific realtime PCR targeted the G-allele at 14,175. Assuming a biallelic locus, we calculated for the percentage of the mutant allele A: 100% \u00c0 allele G. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Version 9.0.1 (SPSS, Chicago, USA).",

The numbering and determination of the gene boundaries within the mitochondrial genome of cheetah #1 (Table 3) were performed on the basis of the F. catus mtDNA (Gen-Bank accession no. NC_001700). Similar to other mammals, the A. jubatus mtDNA is composed of 13 protein-coding genes resembled by structural open reading frames, 22 tRNAs, the 12S-and 16S-rRNA and the regulatory control region. Sequence comparisons to the cat and human (Gen-Bank accession nos. NC_001700 and J01415) showed an overall homology of 91% and 80%, respectively. Protein translation is generally initiated by the start codon ATG (Met) except for MTND2 which is initiated at ATT (Ile). The cheetah mtDNA lacks complete termination codons in the genes MTND1, MTND2, MTCO3, MTND3 and MTND4. As in transcripts of human peptide-coding mitochondrial genes, MTND1, MTND2, MTCO3 and MTND3 contain a stop codon created by posttranscriptional polyadenylation. Therefore, most stop codons in the cheetah mtDNA are TAA. Furthermore, coding sequences overlap between the MTATP8 and MTATP6, the MTND4 and MTND4L, and the MTND5 and MTND6 genes, respectively. The CR contains the RS2 and RS3 repeat units as described in other cheetah subspecies (Freeman et al., 2001 and references therein). The light strand encodes the MTND6 gene and the tRNAs glutamine, alanine, aspargine, cysteine, tyrosine, serine UCN, glutamic acid and proline. The origin of light strand replication (OLR; 6074 to 6105) contains a poly-A stretch; A is repeated nine times in cheetah #4 and 10 times in animals #1 -3.",

            "text": "The sequence analysis of four complete and 26 partial cheetah mitochondrial genomes identified two SNPs at codon 507 in the MTND5 and one SNP at position 76 in the MTND4L gene. These genes belong to the mitochon- drial complex I for which mutations have been reported as one of the most common causes of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies (DiMauro and Schon, 2001) . One SNP in the MTND5 consisted of a nonconservative valine to methionine substitution and was found heteroplasmic in 19 cheetahs belonging to haplotype I. The other polymorphic MTND5 variant leading to the conservative amino acid exchange valine to alanine was found in a homoplasmic state in two cheetahs of haplotype II. In addition, a synonymous homoplasmic polymorphism in the MTND4L was demonstrated in the single haplotype III animal. Comparative alignment between different species indicated that the amino acid at codon 507 in the MTND5 gene is moderately conserved throughout mammalian evolution, i.e., methionine is encoded by the bovine and alanine by the feline mtDNA (GenBank accession nos. NC _ 001567 and NC _ 001700). Nevertheless the nonconservative amino acid exchange valine to methionine probably affects the three-dimensional structure of the resulting ND5 protein, as valine contains only a simple aliphatic side chain, whereas methionine includes a thioether (-S-) group in its side chain. Despite the heteroplasmy was found at high levels (32 -79%), only 11 of 19 cheetahs with the mutant genotype had developed myelopathy and statistical analysis did not reveal a significant correlation between the heteroplasmic amino acid exchange and the myelopathy. Pathogenic mutations are usually, but not invariably, heteroplasmic and a minimum critical number of mutant mtDNA molecules must be present before tissue specific dysfunction and clinical signs appear-a concept termed threshold effect (DiMauro and Schon, 2001) . Homoplasmic exchanges of mtDNA may additionally produce different phenotypes. Interactions between nuclear and mtDNA modify functions of the nervous system, and thus it is suggested that mitochondrial polymorphism in general is probably not as neutral as was previously believed (Roubertoux et al., 2003) . The major processes inducing neurodegeneration are considered to be multifactorial (Jellinger, 2003) and thus a contribution of mtDNA mutations in the aetiology of the cheetah myelopathy cannot be excluded. A possible mechanism of the aetiopathogenesis could be explained by the oligo-genetic model of nuclearmitochondrial interaction which involves a primary mitochondrial mutation, not sufficient to induce pathology, and a nuclear modifier contributing to the pathogenic effect of the mtDNA mutation (Carelli et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study reports the complete mtDNA of A. jubatus and describes one heteroplasmic and two homoplasmic SNPs in the mitochondrial complex I of cheetahs with and without neurodegenerative disease. Our results showed no significant correlation between the SNPs and the cheetah myelopathy and thus these mutations as singular cause for the neurodegeneration appear unlikely. It remains to be clarified whether the neurodegenerative disease in cheetahs is multifactorial involving a contribution of these mtDNA polymorphisms.",
