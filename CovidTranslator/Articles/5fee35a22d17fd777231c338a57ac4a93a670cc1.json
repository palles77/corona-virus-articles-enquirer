Here we use simple stochastic simulations to evaluate different approaches taken to tackle the crisis, along with the efficiency they will hold and the number of casualties they may incur. It is clear that the less strict the social distancing the more time it will take for life to return to normal, and the more lives will be at risk. This is shown through simulations formed by an open sourced code, which allows evaluation of the outcomes from different intervention scenarios or conditions.",

Time from symptomatic to sick is observed to peak at 7 to 8 days and time from hospitalisation to death varies between 1 and 10 days approximately.

As seen in Figure 3 , the number of deaths in Italy and the United Kingdom correlate well with the predicted deaths. The number of recorded cases also conform well with the simulation, however they may be slightly higher due to the larger number of people getting tested than actually being hospitalised. All in all, it is clearly seen that the simulation overall reflects the available data well. Now, looking at the simulations for the UK, we can explore the different outcomes for the different approaches taken. If, like Sweden, the UK were to take the route of relying on herd immunity, as seen in Figure 4 , almost all of the population becomes immune (with the exception of the 1.3% of the population that die). The length of time that this will take is just over three months as seen in the graphs. So, the result of this approach would be a relatively fast outcome with a large percentage of people immune, but with the downside of having an estimated 800,000 mortalities.",
