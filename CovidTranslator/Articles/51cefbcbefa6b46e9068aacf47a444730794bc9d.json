In influenza, for example, mutations in the stalk can reduce the virus's ability to fuse with host cell membrane, a key step in infection. The resistance of the stalk to mutation accumulation means that drugs targeting this protein segment, as urumin does, could serve as a lasting antiviral, Krammer explains. In fact, Krammer and his colleague Peter Palese, also at Mount Sinai, believe that a vaccine approach that targets the stalk of spike proteins could help produce a long-awaited universal influenza or HIV vaccine. First, though, scientists must figure out how to coax the body into making antibodies against the stalk.",

George, a molecular ecologist at the Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology in Kerala, India, put his swabs of slime in plastic tubes, sealed them and sent the samples to the lab of his longtime collaborator, Emory University immunologist Joshy Jacob, in Atlanta. Over the next several months, Jacob isolated 32 different peptides from the H. bahuvistara slime, all of which were new to science, including one that seemed able to thwart the H1N1 flu virus in both cells in a dish and mice.

Initial studies showed that the FLUTCORE approach protects mice from a range of mutations as it passes in an endless chain from person to person. The stalk, however, is less variable, and Palese has believed for decades that targeting this part of the protein could form the basis of a universal flu vaccine that doesn't need to be updated every year.

A vaccine with 'headless' hemagglutinin proteins would get around this issue. His initial attempt didn't pan out as he' d hoped. The proteins Palese and colleagues made were too unstable.

The arrival of the swine flu pandemic provided a perfect way for Palese to test whether humans could naturally produce antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk.

Palese believed that antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk played a major role in this switch. Mouse studies supported this hypothesis, as exposure to different strains of influenza triggered the production of anti-stalk antibodies. Other researchers had identified a potential segment of the hemagglutinin stalk where human antibodies might bind 3 . In work published in PNAS, Palese synthesized chimeric hemagglutinin proteins to show that infection with pandemic H1N1 after exposure to seasonal H1N1 influenza boosted the production of hemagglutinin stalk antibodies, two of which were segments of the Env stalk. Following this discovery, scientists developed a vaccine that targeted the V3 loop, a portion of which lay in the Env stalk. This attempt fizzled out after they failed to show adequate HIV protection in animal models. Current HIV vaccines in development use Env stalk antigens as only one part of a broader strategy, according to Dennis Burton, a vaccinologist at the Scripps Research Institute.",

Using monoclonal antibodies from individuals who had survived SARS or MERS, McLellan and virologist Mark Denison of Vanderbilt University identified the parts of the coronavirus spike protein most likely to elicit an immune response. The researchers then turned to a new technique that enabled them to flash freeze different viral particles in an array of orientations, bombard the particles with electrons and then use supercomputers to reconstruct their 3D shape down to a resolution of four angstroms.
