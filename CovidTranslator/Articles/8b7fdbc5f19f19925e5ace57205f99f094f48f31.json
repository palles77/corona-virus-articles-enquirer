The transmission optimization of HWSNs is an issue worth studying deeply, which is facing challenges such as data diversity, real-time requirement, reliable transmission, dynamic environment and so on. This paper considers four kinds of transmission cost comprehensively, and adopts the stochastic differential game theory to discuss this issue. With the objective of minimizing the transmission cost, three kinds of game models are constructed, i.e., cooperative model, partial cooperative model and non-cooperative model. The optimal transmission strategies under different game modes are obtained for HWSNs. The numerical simulation compares three strategies and verifies the validity of the method present in this paper.",

The usual method is to construct the objective function and get the optimal solution. Generally, the objective is minimizing network cost or maximizing network utility, and combined with efficient scheduling schemes when necessary. To minimize the network cost, Street et al. [11] formulated an adjustable robust function. With the power balance and the security guarantee consideration, the network cost is consisted by energy generation cost and reserves cost of generators in their function. With the objective of minimum delay, Alkhdour et al. [12] employed Integer Linear Program (ILP) to formulate the cost function of WSNs, and the network is optimized with periodic application. To deal with the idle listening issue of WSNs, Abrardo et al. [13] investigated the distributed energy optimization by employing game theory. With the analytic model their constructed, the energy consumption of nodes can be predicted. To optimize power control and routing jointly, He et al. [14] investigated cross-layer design issue of WSNs, and the physical layer, MAC layer and network layer are considered. In the light uncertainty of link access, two situations, i.e., probabilities is known and unknown, were considered respectively, and the corresponding heuristic algorithm is proposed.",

The numerical simulation is started on MATLAB 7.0. For the sake of simplicity, 3 nodes are considered in HWSNs, that is, i \u00bc 1; 2; 3. Then, to the partial cooperative game model, three situations are needed to be considered, i.e., node 1 cooperates with node 2, node 1 cooperates with node 3, and node 2 cooperates with node 3. The efficiency of the traffic distribution can be reflected by the network load. Since the reliability r i and the credibility c i are both related to the parameter h i , and h i is reflected directly in the expression of data transmission strategy, different values are set for h i to distinguish the capability of nodes, i.e., h i \u00bc 0:9; 0:7; 0:5 \u00bd . The other parameters setting is a \u00bc 200, b \u00bc 0:2, c \u00bc 4, q \u00bc 0:1, l \u00bc 0:03, x \u00bc 8, g \u00bc 10, which can meet the desired observation results by several trials.

The data transmission rate v G i based on the cooperative model shown in Fig. 3 is higher than the rates based on the partial cooperative model shown in Fig. 4 , and the non-cooperative model gains the lowest rate shown in Fig. 5 . It is indicated that the more node participates in the cooperative coalition, the higher data transmission rate will be reached. Notably, the high data rate will shorten the data transmission time and bring the nice efficiency of traffic distribution, which is accord with the simulation results in Fig. 2 . Figure 6 gives the comparison of the transmission cost based on different game models. The results show that the data transmission cost based on the cooperative strategy is the least one among all of these five strategies. And at the time of other costs rising, the cooperative one is descending remarkably. To the partial cooperative game, the cooperative coalition K 3 \u00bc 2; 3 f ggains the least cost initially, but as the game going, the cost is rising gradually, while the coalition K 1 \u00bc 1; 2 f g with high values of h i will get the better performance than it.
