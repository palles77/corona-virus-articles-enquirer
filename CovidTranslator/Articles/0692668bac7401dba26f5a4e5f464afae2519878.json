Perkkio and Savilahti 3 noted decreased numbers of immunoglobulin-containing cells (B ceils) in the intestinal mucosa of newborn humans compared with older infants. They suggested that a reduction in immunoglobulin-producing cells and secretory IgA in the intestine may account for the increased incidence of infection at mucosal surfaces early in life. Selner 5 also found decreased salivary IgA in infants compared with older children and adults. Secretory IgA, present in the intestine, is resistant to digestion and therefore is present in stool. 6 However, the antibody is present in only trace amounts in stool during the first few weeks of life compared with later in development ( Figure 1 ). Immunoglobulin A, which is present in human milk and contributes to the protective effect of milk, will be discussed more fully later. This immunoglobulin is produced in the intestine, by mucosal plasma cells that have differentiated from B lymphocytes. 79 The plasma cells, located in the lamina propria of the mucosa, synthesize dimeric lgA, which is composed of two IgA molecules (dimeric IgA) connected by a joint, or J piece.l~ A secretory component on the enterocyte membrane acts as a receptor for the dimeric IgA. 9 The secretory component has been localized by Secretory IgA, produced in the intestine and excreted onto the mucosal surface, binds antigen, thereby preventing antigen attachment to the epithelial surface. 9, 10 It has been suggested that secretory IgA may prevent bacterial adhesion to the intestinal epithelial surface and suppress the growth of certain bacterial pathogens. Secretory IgA may also be important in enhancing resistance against viral enteritis. The quest for other potential actions of secretory IgA, such as opsonization and complement fixation, has been largely unsuccessful.",

Because of physical isolation, the cleanliness of nursing procedures, and the use of multiple antibiotics, the normal bacterial colonization of premature infants may be delayed. Limited antigenic exposure may retard intestinal immune development, and the organisms may then multiply in the gut unhindered. The immature gut does not suppress the bacteria, especially in the lower ileum, and toxic products from the growing bacteria may be absorbed and may cause mucosal damage, initiating NEC. 27 Poor nutritional status may be present in premature infants, and has a marked adverse effect on systemic and intestinal immune function. 28-31 Spenger et al. 32 described 29 cases of NEC that occurre d after the neonatal period; 22 of the 29 infants were malnourished (weight <80% of the expected weight for age).

            "text": "Proteolytic enzymes. The synthesis of proteolytie enzymes by the pancreas appears to be another important nonimmune intestinal defense mechanism. Walker et al. 38 showed that the breakdown of iodine 125-labeled BSA by jejunal gut sacs from pancreatic duct-ligated rats is significantly decreased in comparison with that in control animals with intact pancreatic ducts. The increased concentration of intact protein present when pancreatic proteases are blocked from entering the intestine is then available for absorption. Walker et al. found that the enteral treatment of pancreatic duct-ligated rats with pancreatic extracts led to an increase in the digestion of 125I-BSA in the gut sacs in vitro and to a decrease in the absorption of intact BSA. Saffran et al. 39 fed lysine vasopressin and aprotinin (an inhibitor of trypsin) Or LVP alone to adult Sprague-Dawley rats and noted an increased antidiuretic effect in LVP-and aprotinin-fed animals Compared with animals given LVP alone. The authors suggested that inhibition of pancreatic proteases led to the transport of increased amounts of intact vasopressin across the intestine and into the blood to exert a systemic effect. Our experiments support the findings of Saffran et al. Newborn rabbits underwent gavage with BSA and aprotinin or with BSA alone4~ animals treated with BSA and aprotinin had more than twice the amount of immunoreactive BSA per milliliter of plasma 4 hours after a gavage feeding than did animals given BSA alone. Others have suggested that in the suckling animal, intraluminal intestinal proteolytic activity is a regulator of nonselective protein uptake. 41 Enteropeptidase (enterokinase), the brush-border enzyme present in the duodenum, converts inactive trypsinogen to active trypsin. Antonowicz and Lebentha142 found that full-term human infants had only 17% of the enteropeptidase (enterokinase) in intestinal washes that children 1 to 4 years of age had. This finding is in agreement with the observation that newborn infants have approximately one tenth of the intestinal tryptie activity found in children 9 months of age and older. 43 That proteolytic activity is important in intestinal host defense is supported by studies of NEC in infants, children, and adults in New Guinea who subsist on a diet high in natural ant!proteases. 44, 45 However, at periodic festivals, meat is eaten that may have been poorly cooked after contaminated with Clostridium perfringens, which produces a beta toxin. The infant, because of suppression of intestinal proteases and perhaps malnutrition, does not effectively hydrotyze the toxin, and the unhydrolyzed toxin produces severe inflammation of the intestine. 44, 45 Intestinal mueins. Intestinal mucins are also important in intestinal host defense. These complex macromoleeules contain a protein core and carbohydrate side chains. Mucin production takes place in both goblet cells and intestinal epithelial cells. Forstner 46 stated that a large part of intes-tinal mucin arises from epithelial cells. However, mucins from goblet cells, epithelial ceils, and other glycoproteins probably all contribute to the mucin layer of the intestine. Edwards 47 suggested that intestinal mucins may be a medium in which most macromolecules are insoluble, whereas small molecules are soluble and free to diffuse. He speculated that the prime role of mucins may therefore be to exclude macromolecules and larger particles from contact with cell membranes. He pointed out that IgA is present with mucins in many secretions. In fact, IgAmolecules have a mucin-like glycoprotein sequence at the hinge region between their Fc and Fab subunits. 1~ This observation raises the possibility that IgA, with its mucin-like portion in the mucin phase, sits at the interface between mucin and overlying fluid. The remainder of the molecule extends into the overlying aqueous phase, like a detergent or a phospholipid at the interface between a surface phase and a water phase. The IgA would then form a monolayer on the surface of the mucin, where it is needed in defense against potential antigens and pathogens. Edwards' suggestion that mucin retards macromolecular absorption is supported by some experimental observations. Nimmerfall and Rosenthaler 49 noted that diffusion of a compound through the hydrated mucin network is likely to depend on the charge and hydration radius of the molecule and on the ability of the molecule to form hydrogen bonds. They found that intestinal absorption of molecules in the rat correlates inversely with molecular weight. Hence molecules of high molecular weight are retarded in their passage through the mucin layer and therefore are not absorbed as extensively as small molecules.",

The serum concentration of immunoglobulins A, G, and M on day 5 was significantly higher in the serum of colostrumfed human infants than in exclusively bottle-fed infants. The investigators suggested that immunoglobulins present in colostrum are to some extent absorbed intact from the intestine of human milk-fed infants. Vukavic 62,63 confirmed their observation by quantitating the concentration of IgA in human infants fed intact IgA and IgA denatured by heating; the denatured IgA was not recognized by the immunodiffusion assay used. Infants fed intact IgA had significantly increased serum IgA concentrations in comparison with infants fed denatured IgA. Roberts and Freed 64 measured the IgA concentration in the saliva and nasal mucus of breast-fed and bottle-fed infants; breast-fed infants had significantly increased IgA levels compared with bottle-fed infants, and the authors suggested that the IgA-producing lymphocytes of the neonate are \"switched on\" by a factor in maternal colostrum. Ogra et al. 65 administered to infants human colostrum rich in IgA directed against polio virus. All infants at birth had umbilical cord blood without antipolio antibodies. However, when seven infants whose ages ranged from 18 to 72 hours were fed the colostrum, detectable antipolio IgA was present in the serum of three infants shortly after the feeding. The authors concluded that intact lgA may have been transported across the intestine of these infants to convey passive immunity. The evidecnce now suggests that human milk is associated with absorption of intact IgA or stimulation of plasma cells to produce increased amounts of IgA, or both.",

Newborn rabbits were given BSA by orogastric feeding. 66,67 Blood obtained 4 hours after the gavage contained approximately 5 #g of immunoreactive BSA per milliliter of plasma (Table II) . Weaned animals given the same amount of BSA per unit of body weight did not have detectable immunoreactive BSA in plasma after the feeding. Even when blood was obtained from older an- imals at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 hours after the BSA feeding we were unable to detect immunoreactive BSA in the plasma of the mature animals by means of electroimmunodiffusion. However, with a more sensitive radioimmunoassay, nanogram quantities of BSA were detected in the plasma of the older animals. Newborn animals also had an increased clearance of plasma BSA compared with adult animals. 66 We concluded that the increased levels of immunoreactive BSA in the plasma of newborn animals after BSA feeding did not represent a decrease in the clearance of the intravascular protein but, instead, represented increased absorption of intact BSA. Studies of human infants have led to the same conclusion; the intestine is more permeable to the uptake of intact proteins early in life than in adulthood. Infants and children have increased amounts of antibodies to cow milk protein in their serum compared with adults. 68, 69 The assumption is that the increased levels of cow milk protein antibodies are due to the increased transport of intact protein across the intestine and subsequent stimulation of the systemic immune system. Roberton et al. 7~ reported more direct evidence that intact protein absorption occurs in human infants. They measured the concentration of/3-1actoglobulin in the sera of 47 preterm and term infants after feeding a standard amount of a cow milk-based formula. Preterm infants, particularly those born at less than 33 weeks of gestation, had higher serum concentrations of fl-lactoglobulin than did term neonates given an equivalent milk feeding. These results suggest that the ability of the gastroinestinal tract to exclude antigenically intact food proteins increases with gestational age.",

Infants born at a gestational age of 31 to 36 weeks had a period of ~ nhanced permeability to lactulose during the first week of life. The lactulose/rhamnose excretion ratio was significantly higher on day 2 than on days 9 or 16, when a mature pattern of permeability was seen. Infants born at a gestational age of 26 to 29 weeks had a \"mature\" pattern of permeability at birth, followed by a temporary period of enhanced permeability at 3 to 4 weeks of age. The authors proposed that the enhanced permeability to larger molecules is a temporary condition of the neonatal bowel in man, as in other mammals, but that the immunologic implications \"remain to be established.\" Weaver et al. 72 found that babies born before a gestational age of 34 weeks had higher intestinal permeability to lactulose than more mature babies. The absorption of intact lactulose decreased appreciably during the first week. Weaver et al. 73 found that breast-feeding was associated with decreased intestinal permeability to intact lactulose compared with bottle feeding. Using an animal model, 74 we have observed decreased macromolecular absorption associated with breast-feeding, but others have shown that breast-and bottle-fed infants do not differ in intestinal permeability to intact macromolecules. 7~ The development of NEC has been associated with ischemia, infectious agents, and hyperosmolar feedings, as noted elsewhere in this symposium. The uptake of macromolecules across the intestine is increased during ischemia, 75 increased with certain infections, 76 and increased in the presence of hyperosmolar fluids. 77, 78 Absorption of intact bacteria. Not only is the intestine of newborn infants more permeable to the uptake of macromolecules, it is also more permeable to the uptake of intact bacteria. When the mucosal barrier to the uptake of intact viable bacteria fails, indigenous bacteria colonizing the gastrointestinal tract may pass across the intestinal mucosa to infect the mesenteric lymph nodes and other systemic organs and tissues. This process is termed bacterial translocation. The translocation of intestinal bacteria seems more likely to occur in young animals. 79 In studies by Glode et al., 8~ orally administered Escherichia coli caused a 53% incidence of bacteremia in 2-to 3-day-old rats; the incidence decreased to 10% at 15 days of age and to zero at 30 days of age. Likewise, Pluschke et al. 81 studied strains of E. coli; almost all strains translocated to the blood or mesenteric lymph nodes when orally inoculated into newborn rats given no prior antibiotic therapy. The extent and ease of translocation of these organisms would not have been possible in adult animals.79, 8 l Mizrahi et al. 82 described 18 premature babies who died of NEC. Enteric organisms were obtained from blood in 7 of 13 who were tested while alive. Postmortem blood sam-pies were positive for enteric organisms in 13 of 16 infants tested. It is reasonable to conclude that translocation of enteric bacteria occurred in these infants during the later stages of NEC.",

Bauer et al., 9~ in a large multicentered collaborative randomized tiral, found a significantly decreased (p = 0.002) incidence of NEC in the infants whose mothers had been treated with steroids antenatally. Accelerated intestinal maturation induced by antenatal maternal steroid therapy may have accounted for the decreased incidence of NEC in steroid-exposed infants. There were no adverse reactions to steroid therapy. Glucocorticoids induce precocious maturation of the gut. 91 Celano et al. 92 showed that the antenatal administration of steroids to pregnant rats accelerated maturation of the fetal intestine; rats exposed in utero to exogenous steroids had a precocious appearance of jejunal sucrase. Administration of glucocorticoids to suckling rats or mice also increases salivary amylase activity, gastric acid secretion, and activity of gastric pepsinogen, pancreatic amylase, and a variety of other enzymes. 91 Other studies have documented a change in intestinal microvillus membranes in young animals exposed to steroids. The MVM obtained from the intestine of newborn animals are disorderd in comparison with MVW from adult animals; this difference in membrane organization may account in part for the increased attachment and penetration of macromolecules noted during the perinatal period. 93-95 In addition, intestinal MVM from suckling animals contain greater amounts of total lipid, cholesterol, and phosphotipid per miligram of protein than do mature MVM preparations.94.95 However, when pregnant rats are injected with dexamethasone, the intestinal MVM from their pups are more ordered, or mature, than those of matched control subjects. 96 Glucocorticoids administered postnatally also accelerate maturational changes in MVM. 96 The events of \"closure\" (the physical process of sealing the epithelial barrier early in life to the increased transport of macromolecules) appear to be preprogrammed and associated with intestinal maturation; evidence is contradictory as to the importance of steroids in accelerating closure.",

            "text": "Identification of infants at risk. Wilson et al. 111 studied the epidemiologic interrelationships among birth weight, gestational age, and age at onset of NEC. Weekly birth weight-specific attack rates for NEC declined sharply in all birth weight groups when the equivalent of 35 to 36 weeks of gestational age was reached. The authors' data are consistent with the hypothesis that the risk period for NEC is determined primarily by the maturity of the gastrointestinal tract. 111 These data are supported by other studies whose findings suggest that the occurrence of NEC is most closely associated with immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract and that with increased maturatino there is a significantly lower incidence of NEC. [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] It appears reasonable to suggest that the development of NEC is dependent on the interplay of numerous factors. The premature infant is at greatest risk by virtue of immature intestinal host defense mechanisms, and when additional insults are introduced, such as stress (ischemia, cold), potential pathogens, and hyperosmolar feedings, the additional insults may overwhelm the immature intenstine. It is imperative to continue our studies of NEC to determine how we can best indentify infants at greatest risk for this disease. Additional research is also needed to evaluate whether gastrointestinal host defense may be bolstered in these infants to protect them from the development of NEC.",
