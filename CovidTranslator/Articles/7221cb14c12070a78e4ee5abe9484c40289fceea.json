The insertion of polybasic 152 amino acids at the cleavage site in the HAs of some AIV subtypes is associated with enhanced 153 pathogenicity 16, 17 . Notably, HCoV-19 is characterized by a four-amino-acid-insertion at the 154 junction of S1 and S2, not observed in other lineage B beta-CoVs 18, 19 . This insertion, which 155 represents a poly-basic (furin) cleavage site, is unique to HCoV-19 and is present in all HCoV-156 19 sequenced so far. The insertion of three residues, PAA, at the junction of S1 and S2 in 157 RmYN02 ( Fig. 2h and Extended Data Figure 2 ) is therefore of major importance. Although the 158 inserted residues (and hence nucleotides) are not the same as those in RmYN02, and hence 159 are indicative of an independent insertion event, that they are presented in wildlife (bats) 160 strongly suggests that they are of natural origin and have likely acquired by recombination. 161",

In 1960s, two CoVs, 229E and OC43, were 48 identified in clinical samples from patients experiencing the common cold 3 . More recently, 49 four additional human CoVs have been successively identified: severe acute respiratory 50 syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, NL63 in late 2004, HKU1 in January 2005, and 51 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012.

This virus 70 shared 96.1% nucleotide identity and 92.9% identity in the S gene, again suggesting that bats 71 play a key role as coronavirus reservoirs 2 . Notably, however, two research groups recently 72 reported several novel beta-CoVs related to HCoV-19 in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) . Although these pangolins CoVs are more distant to HCoV-19 than RaTG13 across 75 the virus genome as a whole, they are very similar to HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain 76 (RBD) of the S protein, including at the amino acid residues thought to mediate binding to 77 ACE2 8 . It is therefore possible that pangolins play an important role in the ecology and 78 evolution of CoVs, although whether they act as intermediate hosts for HCoV-19 is currently 79 unclear. Indeed, the discovery of viruses in pangolins suggests that there is a wide diversity 80 of CoVs still to be sampled in wildlife, some of which may be directly involved in the 81 author/funder.
