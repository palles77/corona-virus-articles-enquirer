WHO published the first edition of the Laboratory biosafety manual in 1983. The manual encouraged countries to accept and implement basic concepts in biological safety and to develop national codes of practice for the safe handling of pathogenic microorganisms in laboratories within their geographical borders. Since 1983, many countries have used the expert guidance provided in the manual to develop such codes of practice. A second edition of the manual was published in 1993.",

The third edition stresses throughout the importance of personal responsibility. New chapters have been added on risk assessment, safe use of recombinant DNA technology and transport of infectious materials. Recent world events have revealed new threats to public health through deliberate misuse and release of microbiological agents and toxins. The third edition therefore also introduces biosecurity concepts -the protection of microbiological assets from theft, loss or diversion, which could lead to the inappropriate use of these agents to cause public health harm. This edition also includes safety information from the 1997 WHO publication Safety in health-care laboratories (1) .",

Such an assessment will take the risk group as well as other factors into consideration in establishing the appropriate biosafety level. For example, an agent that is assigned to Risk Group 2 may generally require Biosafety Level 2 facilities, equipment, practices and procedures for safe conduct of work. However, if particular experiments require the generation of high-concentration aerosols, then Biosafety Level 3 may be more appropriate to provide the necessary degree of safety, since it ensures superior containment of aerosols in the laboratory workplace. The biosafety level assigned for the specific work to be done is therefore driven by professional judgement based on a risk assessment, rather than by automatic assignment of a laboratory biosafety level according to the particular risk group designation of the pathogenic agent to be used (see Chapter 2) . Table 3 summarizes the facility requirements at the four biosafety levels. Thus, the assignment of a biosafety level takes into consideration the organism (pathogenic agent) used, the facilities available, and the equipment practices and procedures required to conduct work safely in the laboratory.",

While there are many tools available to assist in the assessment of risk for a given procedure or experiment, the most important component is professional judgement. Risk assessments should be performed by the individuals most familiar with the specific characteristics of the organisms being considered for use, the equipment and procedures to be employed, animal models that may be used, and the containment equipment and facilities available. The laboratory director or principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that adequate and timely risk assessments are performed, and for working closely with the institution's safety committee and biosafety personnel to ensure that appropriate equipment and facilities are available to support the work being considered. Once performed, risk assessments should be reviewed routinely and revised when necessary, taking into consideration the acquisition of new data having a bearing on the degree of risk and other relevant new information from the scientific literature. One of the most helpful tools available for performing a microbiological risk assessment is the listing of risk groups for microbiological agents (see Chapter 1) . However, simple reference to the risk grouping for a particular agent is insufficient in the conduct of a risk assessment. Other factors that should be considered, as appropriate, include:",

All HEPA filters must be installed in a manner that permits gaseous decontamination and testing. 10 . Biological safety cabinets should be sited away from walking areas and out of crosscurrents from doors and ventilation systems (see Chapter 10). 11. The exhaust air from Class I or Class II biological safety cabinets (see Chapter 10) , which will have been passed through HEPA filters, must be discharged in such a way as to avoid interference with the air balance of the cabinet or the building exhaust system. 12. An autoclave for the decontamination of contaminated waste material should be available in the containment laboratory. If infectious waste has to be removed from the containment laboratory for decontamination and disposal, it must be transported in sealed, unbreakable and leakproof containers according to national or international regulations, as appropriate. 13. Backflow-precaution devices must be fitted to the water supply. Vacuum lines should be protected with liquid disinfectant traps and HEPA filters, or their equivalent. Alternative vacuum pumps should also be properly protected with traps and filters. 14. The containment laboratory -Biosafety Level 3 facility design and operational procedures should be documented.",

Passage through a minimum of two doors prior to entering the rooms containing the Class III biological safety cabinet(s) (cabinet room) is required. In this laboratory configuration the Class III biological safety cabinet provides the primary containment. A personnel shower with inner and outer changing rooms is necessary. Supplies and materials that are not brought into the cabinet room through the changing area are introduced through a double-door autoclave or fumigation chamber. Once the outer door is securely closed, staff inside the laboratory can open the inner door to retrieve the materials. The doors of the autoclave or fumigation chamber are interlocked in such a way that the outer door cannot open unless the autoclave has been operated through a sterilization cycle or the fumigation chamber has been decontaminated (see Chapter 10). -Suit laboratory. A protective suit laboratory with self-contained breathing apparatus differs significantly in design and facility requirements from a Biosafety Level 4 laboratory with Class III biological safety cabinets. The rooms in the protective suit laboratory are arranged so as to direct personnel through the changing and decontamination areas prior to entering areas where infectious materials are manipulated. A suit decontamination shower must be provided and used by personnel leaving the containment laboratory area. A separate personnel shower with inner and outer changing rooms is also provided. Personnel who enter the suit area are required to don a one-piece, positively pressurized, HEPA-filtered, supplied-air suit. Air to the suit must be provided by a system that has a 100% redundant capability with an independent source of air, for use in the event of an emergency. Entry into the suit laboratory is through an airlock fitted with airtight doors. An appropriate warning system for personnel working in the suit laboratory must be provided for use in the event of mechanical system or air failure (see Chapter 10). 2. Controlled access. The maximum containment laboratory -Biosafety Level 4 must be located in a separate building or in a clearly delineated zone within a secure building. Entry and exit of personnel and supplies must be through an airlock or pass-through system. On entering, personnel must put on a complete change of clothing; before leaving, they should shower before putting on their street clothing. 3. Controlled air system. Negative pressure must be maintained in the facility. Both supply and exhaust air must be HEPA-filtered. There are significant differences in the ventilating systems of the Class III cabinet laboratory and suit laboratory: -Class III cabinet laboratory. The supply air to the Class III biological safety cabinet(s) may be drawn from within the room through a HEPA filter mounted on the cabinet or supplied directly through the supply air system. Exhaust air from the Class III biological safety cabinet must pass through two HEPA filters prior to release outdoors. The cabinet must be operated at negative pressure to the surrounding laboratory at all times. A dedicated non-recirculating ventilating system for the cabinet laboratory is required. -Suit laboratory. Dedicated room air supply and exhaust systems are required.",

Redundant exhaust fans are required to ensure that the facility remains under negative pressure at all times. The differential pressures within the suit laboratory and between the suit laboratory and adjacent areas must be monitored. Airflow in the supply and exhaust components of the ventilating system must be monitored, and an appropriate system of controls must be used to prevent pressurization of the suit laboratory. HEPA-filtered supply air must be provided to the suit area, decontamination shower and decontamination airlocks or chambers. Exhaust air from the suit laboratory must be passed through a series of two HEPA filters prior to release outdoors. Alternatively, after double HEPA filtration, exhaust air may be recirculated, but only within the suit laboratory. Under no circumstances shall the exhaust air from the Biosafety Level 4 suit laboratory be recirculated to other areas. Extreme caution must be exercised if recirculation of air within the suit laboratory is elected. Consideration must be given to the types of research conducted, equipment, chemicals and other materials used in the suit laboratory, as well as animal species that may be involved in the research. All HEPA filters need to be tested and certified annually. The HEPA filter housings are designed to allow for in situ decontamination of the filter prior to removal. Alternatively, the filter can be removed in a sealed, gas-tight primary container for subsequent decontamination and/or destruction by incineration. 4. Decontamination of effluents. All effluents from the suit area, decontamination chamber, decontamination shower, or Class III biological safety cabinet must be decontaminated before final discharge. Heat treatment is the preferred method. Effluents may also require correction to a neutral pH prior to discharge. Water from the personnel shower and toilet may be discharged directly to the sanitary sewer without treatment. 5. Sterilization of waste and materials. A double-door, pass-through autoclave must be available in the laboratory area. Other methods of decontamination must be available for equipment and items that cannot withstand steam sterilization. 6. Airlock entry ports for specimens, materials and animals must be provided. 7.

The respective building system's design criteria and design function establish these requirements. In other words, laboratories designated as Biosafety Levels 1-4 will have different and increasingly complex commissioning requirements. Geographical and climatic conditions, such as geological fault lines or extreme heat, cold or humidity may also affect the laboratory design and therefore the commissioning requirements. Upon the completion of the commissioning process, the pertinent structural components and support systems will have been subjected to the various operating conditions and failure modes that can be reasonably expected, and will have been approved. The commissioning process and acceptance criteria should be established early, preferably during the programming phase of the construction or renovation project. By acknowledging the commissioning process early in the project, architects, engineers, safety and health personnel and ultimately the laboratory occupants understand the performance requirements of the specific laboratory and set uniform expectations for laboratory and/or facility performance. The commissioning process provides the institution and the surrounding community with a greater degree of confidence that the structural, electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems, containment and decontamination systems, and security and alarm systems will operate as designed, to assure containment of any potentially dangerous microorganisms being worked with in a particular laboratory or animal facility.",

In some cases, the institution may act as its own commissioning agent. In the case of more complex laboratory facilities (Biosafety Levels 3 or 4), the institution may wish to retain an outside commissioning agent who has demonstrated experience and success in the commissioning of complex biosafety laboratory and animal facilities.

In following these recommendations, the risk to the environment and surrounding community-at-large is also minimized. It has now become necessary to expand this traditional approach to biosafety through the introduction of laboratory biosecurity measures. Global events in the recent past have highlighted the need to protect laboratories and the materials they contain from being intentionally compromised in ways that may harm people, livestock, agriculture or the environment. Before the laboratory biosecurity needs of a facility can be defined, however, it is important to understand the distinction between \"laboratory biosafety\" and \"laboratory biosecurity\". \"Laboratory biosafety\" is the term used to describe the containment principles, technologies and practices that are implemented to prevent unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release. \"Laboratory biosecurity\" refers to institutional and personal security measures designed to prevent the loss, theft, misuse, diversion or intentional release of pathogens and toxins.",

Other laboratory activities, such as streaking agar plates, inoculating cell culture flasks with a pipette, using a multichannel pipette to dispense liquid suspensions of infectious agents into microculture plates, homogenizing and vortexing infectious materials, and centrifugation of infectious liquids, or working with animals, can generate infectious aerosols. Aerosol particles of less than 5 \u00b5m in diameter and small droplets of 5-100 \u00b5m in diameter are not visible to the naked eye. The laboratory worker is generally not aware that such particles are being generated and may be inhaled or may crosscontaminate work surface materials.

Although CJD has been transmitted to humans, there appear to be no proven cases of laboratory-associated infections with any of these agents. Nevertheless, it is prudent to observe certain precautions in the handling of material from infected or potentially infected humans and animals. The selection of a biosafety level for work with materials associated with TSEs will depend on the nature of the agent and the samples to be studied, and should be undertaken in consultation with national authorities. The highest concentrations of prions are found in central nervous system tissue. Animal studies suggest that it is likely that high concentrations of prions are also found in the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and lung. Recent studies indicate that prions in lingual and skeletal muscle tissue may also present a potential infection risk (20) (21) (22) (23) .",

Initially there was concern among molecular biologists that such organisms might have unpredictable and undesirable properties that could represent a biohazard if they escaped from the laboratory. This concern became the focus of a scientific conference held in Asilomar, CA, USA, in 1975 (45) . At that meeting, safety issues were discussed and the first guidelines for recombinant DNA technology were proposed. The subsequent 25+ years of research experience have demonstrated that genetic engineering may be conducted in a safe manner when an appropriate risk assessment is performed and adequate safety measures are used. Recombinant DNA technology or genetic engineering was first used to clone DNA segments in bacterial hosts in order to overexpress specific gene products for further studies. Recombinant DNA molecules have also been used to create GMOs such as transgenic and \"knock-out\" animals and transgenic plants.",

If such animals escaped from the laboratory and transmitted the transgene to the wild animal population, an animal reservoir for that particular virus could theoretically be generated. This possibility has been discussed for poliovirus and is particularly relevant in the context of poliomyelitis eradication. Transgenic mice expressing the human poliovirus receptor generated in different laboratories were susceptible to poliovirus infection by various inoculation routes and the resulting disease was clinically and histopathologically similar to human poliomyelitis. However, the mouse model differs from humans in that alimentary tract replication of orally administered poliovirus is either inefficient or does not occur. It is therefore very unlikely that escape of such transgenic mice to the wild would result in the establishment of a new animal reservoir for poliovirus. Nevertheless, this example indicates that, for each new line of transgenic animal, detailed studies should be conducted to determine the routes by which the animals can be infected, the inoculum size required for infection, and the extent of virus shedding by the infected animals. In addition, all measures should be taken to assure strict containment of receptor transgenic mice.",

Objectives may acknowledge the conditions under which certain activities or behaviours are performed and the required level of proficiency. 3. Specifying training content and media. Content is the knowledge or skill that the trainee must master to be able to meet the behavioural objectives. Those individuals who know the job and its demands best usually define the content of the biosafety training programme.

It is not clear that one teaching method (lectures, televised instruction, computer-aided instruction, interactive video, etc.) is superior to another. Much depends on specific training needs, the make-up of the trainee group, etc. 4. Accounting for individual learning differences.

The instructional event (e.g. training course, videotape, written materials, etc.) should not conflict with, inhibit or be unrelated to mastery of the skill or topic being taught. For example, if the intent of the instruction is to develop capabilities in problem-solving techniques, the instructional approach should stress thinking/reasoning approaches rather than rote memorization. The instruction provided should require productive behaviour and/or appropriate feedback (positive/accurate/credible). In addition, instructional events that provide opportunities for practice under conditions similar to that of the job will enhance the transfer of the skill to the actual job. 6. Training evaluation. This provides information that helps to determine whether the instruction has had the intended effect. Training evaluations generally take four forms: -measuring the trainees' reaction to the instruction provided -measuring the trainees' recollection and/or performance -assessing behavioural change on the job -measuring tangible results in terms of the organization's objectives or goals. The most complete evaluation of a training effort involves assessments for each of the four areas. The least efficient method of evaluation is to consider only the trainees' reactions to the instruction as this may bear little relationship to the extent of actual learning. It should not be used as the sole measurement of training effectiveness. 7. Training revision. Training evaluations rarely indicate that a training programme is a complete success or failure because multiple criteria are used to measure results. Usually the data indicate a better understanding, retention or application of some parts of the course material as compared with others. Variation or gaps in knowledge or the desired competencies resulting from the training effort may reflect the need to consider more training time, alternative instructional techniques or more capable instructors.",
