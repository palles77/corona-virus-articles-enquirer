Although A, B, and C types of influenza exist, type C is detected much less frequently than the other two types and tends to cause only mild infection in humans [1] . In contrast, both A and B types cause outbreaks and epidemics; accordingly, circulating strains of both types are incorporated in seasonal influenza vaccines [1] . Human influenza is most commonly caused by type A viruses, which are the only type known to cause pandemics. Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on surface hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins [1] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the H1N1 (A (H1N1) pdm09) and H3N2 subtypes are currently circulating among humans [1] .",

Subsequently, the WHO declared a pandemic level phase 6 in June 2009. During the pandemic, viral spread via person-to-person contact affected at least 214 countries worldwide, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] . A total of 18,500 laboratory-confirmed deaths were recorded between April 2009 and the end of the pandemic on August 10, 2010 [7] . However, the actual number of respiratory and cardiovascular deaths was estimated to range between 151,700 and 575,500 [7] . After the pandemic, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 replaced the previously circulating seasonal H1N1 and has since remained in seasonal circulation [6] . Currently, circulating influenza B viruses are divided into two main lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria [1] .",
