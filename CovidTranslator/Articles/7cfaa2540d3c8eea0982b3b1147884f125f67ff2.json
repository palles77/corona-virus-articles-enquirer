Here we analyze bulk and single cell RNA-Seq datasets to identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium that express molecules that mediate infection by SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), the causal agent in COVID-19. We find in both mouse and human datasets that olfactory sensory neurons do not express two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. In contrast, olfactory epithelial support cells and stem cells express both of these genes, as do cells in the nasal respiratory epithelium. Taken together, these findings suggest possible mechanisms through which CoV-2 infection could lead to anosmia or other forms of olfactory dysfunction. author/funder. All rights reserved.

CoV-2 is closely related to other beta-coronaviruses, including the causal agents in pandemic SARS and MERS (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively) and endemic viruses typically associated with mild URI syndromes (hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-299E) [5] [6] [7] . Anecdotal reports from clinicians and patients during the 2019-2020 pandemic suggest that infection with CoV-2 is associated with high rates of disturbances in smell and taste perception (anosmia, hyposmia, ageusia and/or dysgeusia) [8] [9] [10] [11] . On March 20, 2020 the Ear, Nose, and Throat Society of the UK and the British Rhinological Society issued a bulletin detailing a strong anecdotal association between CoV-2 infection and anosmia/hyposmia in physician reports from South Korea, China, Italy, France and the United States; this bulletin further argued that individuals with new onset anosmia should self-isolate based upon presumed CoV-2 infection 12 . On March 22, 2020 the American Academy of Otolaryngology proposed that anosmia, hyposmia and dysgeusia (in the absence of other respiratory disease) should be added to symptoms used for screening for CoV-2 infection, and urged precautionary isolation for individuals with these symptoms 13 . brush/microvillar cells [24] [25] [26] (Fig. 1) . The nasal RE is continuous with the epithelium that lines much of the respiratory tract, although transcriptional relationships between cell types observed in the nose RE and those found lower in the respiratory system remain unclear 24 .",

These OSNs express odor receptors on their dendritic cilia, and their axons traverse the cribriform plate at the base of the skull to terminate in the olfactory bulb 27 . OSNs are therefore responsible both for detecting odors in the nasal airspace, and for transmitting information about odors to the brain. OSNs are supported by sustentacular cells, which have been proposed to act as structural supports for sensory neurons, to phagocytose and/or detoxify potentially damaging agents, and to maintain local salt and water balance [28] [29] [30] [31] (Fig. 1) . The OE contains several distinguishable types of basal stem cells that continuously renew sustentacular and OSN populations throughout life 32-34 . These stem cells include globose basal cells (GBCs), which are primarily responsible for regenerating OSNs during normal epithelial turnover, and horizontal basal cells (HBCs), which act as reserve stem cells activated upon tissue damage [35] [36] [37] . The OE also harbors additional cell types including microvillar cells (a subset of which may act as sensory cells), and mucus-secreting Bowman's gland cells 33, 34 .",

Other coronaviruses use different cell surface molecules to facilitate cellular entry; these include DPP4 and FURIN for MERS-CoV, ANPEP for HCoV-299E, TMPRSS11D for SARS-CoV 43, 44 (in addition to ACE2 and TMPRSS2), and ST6GAL1 and ST3GAL4 for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 6 . It has recently been demonstrated through single cell sequencing analysis (scSeq) that cells from the human upper airway -including nasal RE goblet, basal and ciliated cells -express high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, suggesting that these RE cell types may serve as a viral reservoir during CoV-2 infection 45 . However, the analyzed samples did not include any OSNs or sustentacular cells, suggesting that tissue sampling in these experiments was limited to the RE and did not access the OE 46,47 .",

To address the hypothesis that CoV-2 causes anosmia through primary effects on the OE, we queried publicly available mouse, nonhuman primate and human RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and scSeq datasets that include definitive OE populations to assess CoV-2-related gene expression 37, 46, [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . We also mapped scSeq data across different datasets to compare observed gene expression levels from nasal samples to samples obtained from other airway tissues. Our results demonstrate that non-neural cells in the OE express CoV entry-associated molecules, suggesting that infection of these cells could directly or indirectly lead to olfactory dysfunction; this model potentially links gene expression patterns in olfactory support and stem cells to the clinical observation of anosmia in COVID-19 patients.",

Several datasets were available in which sequencing was performed on the whole olfactory mucosa (WOM) and independently on purified populations of mature OSNs [51] [52] [53] . Reanalysis of the data from Saraiva et al. 52 showed that the CoV-2 receptor Ace2 and the protease Tmprss2 are expressed in WOM, as are the cathepsins Ctsb and Ctsl ( Figure 2A) . However, expression of these genes (with the exception of Ctsb) was much lower and Ace2 expression was virtually absent in purified OSN samples (mean \u00b1 SD normalized counts in OSNs; Ace2: 8.6 \u00b1 4.2, Tmprss2 117.3 \u00b1 24.7, Ctsb: 38616.7 \u00b1 1650.2, Ctsl: 1705 \u00b1 87; same in WOM; Ace2: 254.7 \u00b1 22.5, Tmprss2 2279 \u00b1 219.6, Ctsb: 22380 \u00b1 947, Ctsl: 4900 \u00b1 90.5, see Methods). These samples reflected the presence of expected cell types, as the WOM sequencing data included gene expression profiles associated with a wide variety of RE and OE cells, while the purified OSN samples were specifically enriched for markers of mature OSNs. The de-enrichment of Ace2 and Tmprss22 in OSNs relative to WOM was also observed in the two other mouse RNA-Seq datasets 51,53 ( Figure 2B ). We further probed these three mouse datasets to quantify the expression of genes involved in cell entry by other CoVs 6, 38, 45 . Except for St3gal4, all of these genes were detected in WOM and de-enriched in purified OSNs.",

To identify the specific cell types that express Ace2 and Tmprss2, we examined two recently published mouse OE scSeq datasets 49, 50 . This analysis confirmed our results from bulk RNA-seq, as mature OSNs from either dataset did not express Ace2 (zero cells express Ace2 out of 5337 and 51 OSNs, respectively, Figures  2C, 2D) . Ace2 was only detected in two cells (out of 8480) in the first dataset (which included cells drawn from mice aged P0 to P21 47 ). However, Ace2 was detected in more than 1% of GBCs, more than 2% of HBCs and nearly 3% of sustentacular cells in an scSeq dataset generated from adult mice 37 ( Figure 2D ). Furthermore, larger percentages of HBCs, GBCs and sustentacular cells expressed Tmprss2. Taken together, these bulk RNA-Seq and scSeq mouse data demonstrate that CoV-2 cell entry-related genes are expressed in the OE, and suggest that support and stem cells are the most likely candidates for CoV-2 infection within the OE. author/funder.

We therefore asked if, as in the mouse, human ACE2 is absent from OSNs but present in other OE cell types. To do so, we quantified expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in scSeq derived from four human nasal biopsy samples recently reported by Durante et al 48 . Examination of human scSeq gene expression patterns and known marker genes distinguished OSNs, olfactory and respiratory HBCs, as well as subtypes of respiratory epithelial cells and other nonneuronal cells in the OE ( Figure 3B -C). As in the mouse scSeq datasets, neither ACE2 nor TMPRSS2 were detected in mature OSNs, but these genes were detected in many sustentacular cells and HBCs ( Figure 3D -F). Together, these results further support the notion that sustentacular and olfactory stem cells, but not mature OSNs, are the potential target of CoV-2 in the human OE.",

For each cell type in the Deprez lung dataset, a voting strategy was used to identify the most similar cell types in the Durante dataset: each Deprez cell 'voted' on the 50 most similar cells in the Durante dataset. The proportion of 'votes' belonging to each Durante cell type was recorded, and these proportions were reported as the \"mapping probabilities\" shown in Figure 4 (see Methods). The resulting map of cell type similarity ( Figure 4B ) revealed a correspondence between the RE cell types in each dataset, including HBCs, multiciliated cells and secretory cells. Two strong associations were also detected between RE and OE cell types: goblet cells in the RE were similar to Bowman's cells in the OE (96% mapping probability, see Methods) and pulmonary ionocytes in the RE were similar to microvillar cells in the OE (99% mapping probability, see Methods). Pulmonary ionocytes are a recently characterized cell type in the lung RE that express CFTR proteins and the transcription factor FOXl1, which specifies ionocyte cell fate and regulates expression of V-ATPase subunits that participate in ion exchange 56 . Microvillar cells in the Durante dataset exhibited similar high-level expression of CFTR and FOXl1 ( Figure 4C ); however, these cells did not express other markers of microvillar cells (such as TRPM5, IP3R3 and CD73), suggesting that they are either immature microvillar cells or a distinct microvillar subtype residing in the nasal mucosa 57 .",

Viral injury has been extensively modeled in rodents, which has revealed substantial diversity among viruses (and even within different types of coronaviruses) in the nature and extent of damage to the OE 16,58-61 . Intriguingly, infection of the rat with the SDAV coronavirus appears to cause denuding of ciliary cells in the RE, reduction in the number of goblet cells in the RE, and focal infection of subsets of sustentacular cells in the OE. SDAV infection follows a characteristic trajectory, with substantial RE infection preceding OE infection by several days 58 . This pattern is precisely what one might predict for CoV-2 infection in humans, given the cell types that express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the peripheral olfactory system. Importantly, despite the fact that infection in the OE appears limited to small numbers of sustentacular cells, as SDAV infection proceeds OSNs become denuded of cilia (presumably foreclosing the possibility of odor transduction) followed by a disruption in the global architecture of the OE 58 . These observations suggest that coronavirus infection of subsets of sustentacular cells may be sufficient to cause cascading damage in the OE that culminates in the disruption of OSN function.",

The survival time of mature OSNs varies based upon many factors, but on average in the mouse such neurons survive weeks to short months, rather than days or years 62, 63 . Although HBCs in mice appear largely quiescent, recent scSeq data suggests that ongoing neurogenesis may play a larger role than previously appreciated in the human OE 48 . It is therefore possible, over the timescale of CoV2 infection, that damage to HBCs plays a causal role in the development of anosmia; given the slow rate of turnover apparent in OSNs, a more likely scenario is that the dual challenge to the OE of acute loss of sustentacular cells, taken with the inability to effectively renew the OE over time, may result in long-lasting anosmia. Furthermore, work in mice suggests that injury can cause de-differentiation of neuronal progenitors, which may suppress ongoing neurogenesis and potentially abrogate olfactory function. 64 author/funder.

As ionocytes are critical determinants of ion balance in the lung, damage to closely-related microvillar cells in the OE could potentially alter local ion gradients and hence firing properties of sensory neurons.

The importance of secondary inflammatory processes also remains to be assessed. It further remains unclear whether the effects of CoV-2 on smell are responsible for changes in taste perception, or whether taste is affected by independent mechanisms. One clear caveat of our analysis is that scSeq is subject to well-known sampling artifacts related to cell type composition and gene expression capture. Despite these biases, we favor the possibility that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in limited subsets of OE support and stem cells.

However, viral-induced deficits in olfactory function may also be caused by central dysfunction in higher-order olfactory structures. Many viruses, including coronaviruses, have been shown to propagate from the nasal epithelium past the cribriform plate to infect the olfactory bulb and downstream areas like piriform cortex; this form of central infection has been suggested to mediate olfactory deficits, even in the absence of lasting OE damage 16, 40, 59, 61, [67] [68] [69] . Coronoviral RNA has been identified in the brains of patients, suggesting this possibility as a pathophysiological mechanism in the case of COVID-19 67, 70 . That said, it remains unclear whether or how CoV-2 might infect or influence central olfactory structures, given that CoV-2 is unlikely to directly infect the OSNs that send axons to the brain. The rodent coronavirus MHV has been shown to pass from the nose to the bulb, but OSNs do not express CEACAM1, the main MHV receptor 59,71 (data not shown); this observation suggests that coronavirus in the nasal mucosa may reach the brain through mechanisms independent of axonal transport by sensory nerves.

Although both negative and cross-species data should be interpreted with extreme caution, if younger humans (like their mouse counterparts) also express relatively low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, then young COVID-19 patients may be less susceptible to CoV-2-mediated olfactory damage. Furthermore, if the recentlyproposed hypothesis that RE cells act as a reservoir of CoV-2 is found to be true 45 , then a highly speculative possibility is that differences in expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the nasal epithelium (or upper airways) may in part explain the milder clinical course for COVID-19 observed in younger patients. Further scSeq experiments in adult mice and juvenile humans will be required to definitively characterize differences in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression over time.",
