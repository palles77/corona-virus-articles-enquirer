            "text": "The epidemiology and virology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been written about many times and several guidelines on the infection control and public health measures believed necessary to control the spread of the virus have been published. However, there have been few reports of the problems that infectious disease clinicians encounter when dealing with the protean manifestations of this pathogen. This is a qualitative account of some of the issues faced by an infectious disease physician when identifying and treating patients with SARS as well as protecting other healthcare workers and patients, including: identification of the chain of contagion, early recognition of the disease in the absence of a reliable and rapid diagnostic test, appropriate use of personal protective equipment, and the use of isolation to prevent super-spreading events. Many issues need to be addressed if clinicians are to be able to manage the virus should it reappear.",

There have been many publications and scholarly reviews on the origin, 2 pathophysiology, 3 virology, 3,4 clinical features, 3 and epidemiology 5 of the virus. However, there are few detailed accounts of the practical issues faced by clinicians in dealing with a novel, lethal, emerging, nosocomial pathogen. This paper describes the experience of a busy infectious disease clinician at a large teaching hospital in Singapore during the SARS outbreak.",

All patients who met the WHO criteria for SARS 7 were to be transferred to TTSH for isolation and treatment. In the week before she presented to NUH, our patient visited a friend with hepatitis at TTSH and then travelled to east Malaysia. She had no direct contact with patients with SARS at TTSH and the only SARS affected country she had been to was Singapore. On examination she was febrile to 39 \u00ba C, tachypnoeic, tachycardiac, and had bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography (figure 1A). Initial pathology analyses were: a white blood cell count of 19\u00b73 \u03eb 10 9 /L (polymorphs 90%, lymphocyte 4%), haemoglobin 12\u00b75 g/L, platelet count of 149 \u03eb 10 9 /L, urea 7\u00b79 mmol/L, creatinine 257 mol/L, and lactate dehydrogenase 2513 IU/L. This patient was admitted to an isolation ward with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. She was not transferred to TTSH as a suspect SARS case because there had not been any direct contact with patients with SARS and because of her leucocytosis, which was not thought to be a feature of SARS. Even now she would be excluded from Singapore's \"post-epidemic SARS surveillance\", which mandates the absence of leucocytosis. 8 She was treated with levofloxacin and ceftriaxone, but because she continued to deteriorate, her treatment was changed to ceftazidime and later imipenem. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit where she was intubated and mechanically ventilated. A bronchoalveolar lavage was done on March 26, 2003 and cultures were negative for bacteria, fungi, respiratory viruses, and mycobacteria. Despite inotropic support, haemofiltration, and intense ventilatory support with high frequency oscillatory ventilation, she died 8 days after her admission (figure 1B).",

The intensivist progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and had mechanical ventilation, but survived. The son of our patient was also admitted to TTSH with a diagnosis of SARS. The polytechnic where he was studying was closed for 3 days while contact tracing was done for all students and those with closest contact with him were placed on a restrictive home quarantine order; none had SARS. Careful temperature surveillance and a serological study showed that nobody at the NUH intensive care unit or isolation ward was infected with SARS. 10",

The impact on TTSH and other hospitals was considerable; patients were rapidly discharged from TTSH to clear beds for the admission of patients with suspected SARS, and other hospitals had to carry the load from diverted patients. Unfortunately, many of the patients transferred to other hospitals were incubating the SARS virus through casual contact with patients with SARS in the same ward or in common areas such as radiology suites. These patients went on to start epidemics in four of the other five major public hospitals in Singapore. 29 For future outbreaks, we have learnt that all patients in the wards of infected patients are potentially incubating the virus and should be isolated rather than moved to other hospitals. This was practised in September 2003 when an inpatient at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) was found to have (a laboratory-associated case of) SARS. 30",

The use of powered air purifying respirators for all aerosol generating procedures, including bronchoscopy and intubation, was introduced; these were also used in Canadian intensive care units 39 and are thought to have been protective. The use of nebulisers was also discouraged and metered dose inhalers (with spacers as appropriate) were more widely used.

He had no fever, was found to be in atrial fibrillation, and was admitted to a general medical ward with a diagnosis of heart failure. He did not meet SARS criteria for transfer to TTSH or for isolation in our hospital. 31 Despite treatment for heart failure, he deteriorated and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated; he became the source of infection for an entire shift of nurses and the doctor who had administered high flow oxygen therapy to him while wearing a well-fitting N95 respirator. He was transferred to TTSH when his brother was identified as the source of an even larger cluster of infections at SGH. 55 He died of SARS and the infection of several of his work colleagues led to the closure of Singapore's largest wholesale vegetable market and devastation of the local fresh cuisine industry. Home quarantine orders were issued for more than 2000 people working in the market, none of whom were later found to be infected with SARS.",

An individual was publicly prosecuted and jailed for breaking quarantine. The social stigma attached to quarantine was considerable; before the installation of cameras, I was officially quarantined and it was not a pleasant experience. It is not known whether quarantine was necessary, 25, 33, 56 or whether strict isolation and early case finding would have been a better use of resources. In Singapore and elsewhere, isolation has been shown to be highly effective in reducing the number of secondary cases associated with individuals with SARS. Lipsitch and colleagues 57 showed that as the Singapore epidemic progressed, the time to isolation decreased and the corresponding number of secondary cases decreased, with the notable exception of the SGH cluster. 54 In any future epidemic we should be able to isolate and detect cases early and may not have to resort to draconian quarantine rules. Alternatively, a careful system of outpatient follow-up and clinical or serosurveillance, as we did with our first case, might be more practical. 80 813 individuals arriving in Taiwan from SARS affected countries were quarantined for 10 days and only one person (0.001% of the total) developed laboratory confirmed SARS. 32",

A patient with a documented Escheria coli renal abscess and nosocomial pneumonia that responded to carbapenem therapy was also incubating the SARS coronavirus. This patient became the source of infection for 16 healthcare workers, 12 other patients, and eight visitors including our patient. Dual diagnoses are problematic for the management of patients with suspected SARS. What should be the patient management protocol? Do we isolate all patients who were in the same ward as patients with SARS, even if they did not have direct contact with the infected patients? Do we isolate these patients for the duration of their hospital stay in spite of normal chest radiographs and alternative explanations for their fevers? It is clear that we urgently need a rapid diagnostic test. The current diagnostic tests have severe limitations in clinical practice. 50, 59 In Singapore hospitals, some measures used to control the epidemic initially were continued for a year. Staff continued recording their temperatures twice daily even though the infected staff in our hospital were detected by contact tracing of infected patients, not temperature screening. PPE use is still mandated in emergency departments and isolation areas at the time of writing, although we have not had a single case of SARS in our hospital since the end of April 2003. The September 2003 laboratory acquired SARS case 30 was a setback to our SARS containment plans.",

This study confirms the findings of other investigators who found few if any asymptomatic seroconverters in Hong Kong. 60, 61 This finding is interesting given the observation that handlers of civet cats in the wild animal markets of Guandong had serological evidence of SARS but no clinical disease. 62 Although this finding has been cited as evidence for the civet cat as the source of the virus but I look forward to emerging data to help to identify the origin of the virus. 2",
