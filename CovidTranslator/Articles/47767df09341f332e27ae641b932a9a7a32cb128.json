Ebola virus infection is characterized by its rapid onset, high person-to-person transmissibility, and significant mortality rate. The mainstay of treatment has been supportive therapy, and prevention has been dependent on containment using barrier precautions. Effective protection was achieved previously in primates with a heterologous DNA prime and adenoviral boost strategy. The prime-boost immunization relies on the ability of the adenoviral boost to expand the primary T-cell response induced by DNA vaccination. When animals are primed with ADV vectors alone, a robust Ebola-virus-specific cellular and humoral immune response is more rapidly achieved, although the response to a second ADV-GP/NP injection is blunted, probably because of antivector immunity. Here, we explored the possibility that this more rapid initial immune response may nonetheless confer protection and outweigh the stronger immune response that requires additional time. A single immunization with an adenoviral vector encoding Ebola virus proteins is sufficient to confer protection against lethal challenge within four weeks, and this response correlates with both cellular and humoral immune responses to the infection.",

Should this vaccine approach prove effective in humans, our finding raises the possibility that ring vaccination could be used to contain outbreaks, similar to smallpox in the past. This result also suggests alternative strategies for vaccination against Ebola or other acute pathogenic diseases. The prime-boost strategy remains more immunologically potent and, if the response is highly durable, may still be useful for preventative vaccines, for example, in hospital workers. In contrast, the single adenoviral vaccine administration may be better used during acute outbreaks. It is also possible that alternative viral vectors, such as those derived from other adenovirus serotypes or from poxvirus vectors, might be used to boost an ADV type 5 vector primary immunization. Alternative ADV serotypes will also help to overcome immunity to natural ADV type 5 infection that could potentially reduce vaccine efficacy in some populations. A one-shot vaccine may be helpful in the control of Ebola virus outbreaks in great ape populations of central Africa 13 . Analogous single-dose ADV vector immunization could also be used for other emerging and highly lethal infectious pathogens, such as Marburg, Lassa or the SARS coronavirus.",
