The continuously variant antigenicity of IBV limits the application of current vaccine strategies and serological diagnostic systems. S2 protein is an invariant that harbors broad neutralizing epitopes. However, little is known about the key amino acids that contribute to the broad-spectrum S2 epitopes. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the specific amino acids contributing to S2 epitopes. Site mutagenesis and peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) showed that 16R in S2 protein was a key amino acid mediating the antigenicity of S2 protein. S2-derived peptides with 16R, but not those with 16 K, could react with sera against different types of IBVs. Notably, a commercial ELISA kit for detection of antibodies against IBV did not react with sera against all types of IBVs. Taken together, these data demonstrated that S2-derived peptides with 16R could be used as novel marker-based antigens for developing both broad-spectrum vaccines and serological diagnostic kits to control IBV.",

IBV infection generally causes serious respiratory and renal diseases in meat chickens and decreased egg laying in laying hens (Cavanagh, 2007) , resulting in huge economic losses in the poultry industry (Bande et al., 2017) . Although IBV vaccines are widely used, wild-type IBV or IBV escape mutants are frequently isolated from vaccinated chicken flocks because of the circulation of multiple serotypes in flocks and continuous mutation of the protective epitopes of IBVs. Thus, current vaccine strategies need to be re-evaluated, and more efficient, broadly protective IBV vaccines or diagnostic approaches are urgently needed.",

Among these proteins, S glycoprotein is the major protective antigen carrying neutralizing epitopes and can induce efficient immune responses against IBV Galli, 1993, 1995; Kant et al., 1992) . Notably, S protein can be cleaved into the amino-terminal S1 and carboxy-terminal S2 domains by a furine-like protease from the host (Cavanagh, 2007; Eldemery et al., 2017; Kusters et al., 1989) . S1 is responsible for IBV attachment to host cells, whereas S2 contributes to viral fusion activity of IBV (Wickramasinghe et al., 2014) . Both S1 and S2 play vital roles in mediating IBV infection in host cells. S1 is a major protective antigen for IBV, but is highly variable among different IBV stains (Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994) . In contrast to S1, S2 is highly conserved and carries broad antigenic epitopes (Toro et al., 2014) . Therefore, S2 could be a marker for developing more efficient vaccines and broad diagnostic approaches.",

After analysis of complete genome sequences of 330 IBV isolates, we found that almost all IBV strains contained a K at amino acid position 16 (16 K) in S2 before the 1990s. Subsequently, strains with an R at amino acid position 16 (16R) emerged and became the dominant pandemic IBV strains. Interestingly, 16 K IBV strains were mainly associated with respiratory tract diseases, and the 16R IBV strains were mainly associated with renal pathogenicity. Based the region with 8NCPYVSYGKFCIKPDGSIST27 in S2, IBV strains could be divided into two groups: Group \u2160 containing 16 K, and Group \u2161 containing 16R (Table 2) . Two strains, i.e., B1648 (accession number: KR231009) and gamaCoV/ck/China/I0636/16 (accession number: MH924835), contained T and Q as the 16th amino acids (group I-like), respectively.

We analyzed the reactivity between the peptides and different genotypes of IBVs. Only Pep1 showed good reactions with most sera. However, Pep1 did not react with the sera from CK/CH/2010/JT1 strains.

The information on the geographical origin and time of isolation of these sequences were also obtained from the NCBI database. Sequence analysis further revealed that IBV strains carrying 16R in the epitope of Group \u2161 were first isolated in the 1990s, and the proportion then increased thereafter (Fig. 3A) . IBV strain KM91, which was isolated in 1991, was the first IBV with such an epitope. The incidence of 16Rcontaining IBV strains increased over time. Variations in key amino acids in the conserved S2 protein suggested that the IBVs had undergone considerable variation and evolution, necessitating new vaccine strategies and diagnostics to prevent and control IBV. Currently, the epitope of Group \u2161 is widely present in IBV isolates from Asia, America, Europe, and Africa (Fig. 3A, 3B) , consistent with the prevalence of the lineage GI-19, the so-called QX-type IBV, in China and worldwide (Zhao et al., 2017) . Our results demonstrated that the epitope of the QX type IBV dominant in chicken flocks in China all belonged to this group of IBV strains containing 16R. .

Discussion IBV is a typical coronavirus that is constantly recombining and mutating its antigenicity, leading to the presence of multiple serotypes and genotypes of IBV strains and causing major challenges in disease prevention and control (Cavanagh, 2007) . As an important antigenic protein, S1 has been used in vaccine development (Hodgson et al., 2004; Wickramasinghe et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2015) . Notably, S2 protein also can induce protective immune responses (Eldemery et al., 2017; Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2005) . In contrast to S1, S2 protein is thought to be invariant and contain neutralizing epitopes (Wickramasinghe et al., 2014) . Of these epitopes in S2, the epitope containing amino acids 8-27 has been identified as a broad antigenic epitope for IBVs. Our data demonstrated that this epitope in S2 protein from different types of IBVs was also not highly conserved in different IBV serotypes and could be divided into two groups, designated Group \u2160 (8NCPYVSYGKFCIKPDGSIST27-like) and Group \u2161(8SCPYVSYGRFCIQ-PDGSIKQ27-like). The two strains, B1648 (accession number: KR231009) and gamaCoV/ck/China/I0636/16 (accession number: MH924835), were classified as Group I because their 16th amino acids were T and Q, respectively.",

Moreover, 16R was identified as a key amino acid for the broad antigenicity of Group \u2161. Valastro et al. (2016) performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene of 1286 strains to derive a new and coherent classification scheme for IBVs. They divided the IBV strains into six genotypes, labeled GI, GII, GIII, GIV, GV, and GVI. GI contained 27 lineages, whereas GII, GIII, GIV, GV, and GVI contained only one lineage each. Our grouping method was based on S2 protein of IBV. We further compared two different grouping methods and found that GI-7, GI-19, and GI-22 belonged to Group \u2161, whereas the other strains belonged to Group \u2160. Notably, widespread QX genotype, new cluster genotype, TW-I type, LDT3 type, and BJ type IBVs all carried 16R in the S2 protein. This suggested that peptides with 16R derived from S2 protein could be used as novel marker-based antigens for developing broad-spectrum vaccines against circulating IBVs. Our grouping method could distinguish strains causing respiratory tract disease and from those causing renal disease. We found that all QX, LDT3, and BJ genotype IBV strains prevalent in China in recent years contained the 16R mutation, which may partly explain the poor efficacy of conventional vaccines against new epidemic IBV strains. Thus, our results may provide guidance for vaccine selection.",
