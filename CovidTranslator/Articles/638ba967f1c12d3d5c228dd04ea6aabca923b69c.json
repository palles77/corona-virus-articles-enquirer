The CNTs are promising quasi one-dimensional nanomaterial with well ordered flat networks of fused benzene rings or hollow graphitic cylindrical tubular structure consisting of hexagonal arrangement with sp 2 hybridized carbon atoms [1] [2] [3] [4] . CNTs are mainly classified into four types, based upon the structure and diameters including single-, double-, triple-, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The length of the tubes can be extended depending on the type of production method [5] [6] [7] [8] . CNTs are one of the attractive tools in nanotechnology with surface engineered carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs), emerging as a new family of carbon nanovectors that enabled numerous biomedical applications. Functionalization plays a pivotal role in the design of CNTs-based nanomaterials by rendering them more biocompatible and less toxic with increased dispersibility in comparison to pristine CNTs. The methodology of functionalization of CNTs can be classified broadly into two categories: (a) covalent attachment of active biochemical moieties through chemical reactions onto CNTs skeleton, and (b) non-covalent adsorption or wrapping of different functional molecules [7, 9] . The various types of nanocomposites have been summarized in Fig. 1 .",

The CNTs have been claimed to be able to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) by different targeting mechanisms and act as safe and effective targeted drug delivery system [22, 23] . Since the last one-decade researchers have continuously explored and assessed the CNTs as substrate for neuronal tissue growth, regeneration and its application in neuroscience research. CNTs have numerous salient features with a simple and inert molecular tubular nanoneedle structure and porosity beneficial to neural interface for trafficking of cells, sensing of microenvironments, delivery of transfection agents, and scaffolding for incorporating within host body, to provide the support for adhesion, proliferation and migration of cells. Ren and co-workers developed a dual targeted delivery system based on the oxidized PEGylated MWCNTs modified with Angipep-2 (a targeting ligand of lowdensity lipoprotein receptor related-protein (LRP) receptors) loaded with Doxorubicin (DOX) and systematically evaluated their in vitro and in vivo anti-glioma effect by C6 cytotoxicity and median survival time (MST) of intracranial C6 glioma bearing Balb/c mice. The combination of O-MWCNTs-PEG with angiopep-2 as targeting ligand was claimed to play a role of active dual-targeting and combination of O-MWCNTs-PEG and angiopep-2 constituted an ideal dual-targeting drug delivery to brain glioma [22] .",

Further, gene therapy may suffer rapid degradation of exogenous nucleic acid. Now-a-days some effective multiple non-viral delivery systems like polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, cell penetrating peptides, cationic lipids, dendrimers and f-CNTs are being employed to efficiently deliver nucleic acids including siRNA with reduced immunogenicity. The efficiency of gene expression mediated by these nanovectors is lower as compared with the viral vector but they provide the advantages of easy up-scaling, flexibility and reduced immunogenicity. The applications of CNTs as new vectors for delivery of nucleic acids is another area of research and development which could offer several advantages for nucleic acid, siRNA, gene and protein delivery owing to their thin and long architecture that offers a large surface area to which siRNA can be bound and delivered to target site. Further, CNTs may have protective capacity, which stabilize and lead to more efficient cellular transfection and prevent the lysosomal degradation of encapsulated nucleic acids [30] . Kawaguchi and co-workers synthesized DNA-functionalized SWCNTs to improve the dispersibility as compared to acid treated SWCNTs. The binding ratio of the acid-treated SWCNTs and DNA was calculated to be 3:1 (DNA/SWCNTs) from the phosphorous content in DNA-SWCNTs [31] . In context of the enhanced gene delivery Sanz and co-workers were first to develop and demonstrate the enhanced gene delivery using lysosomotropic anti-malarial drug chloroquine loaded polyethyleneimine (PEI)-coated DWCNTs to enhance the cell transfection efficiency [32] .",

Previous literature suggested non-biodegradable nature of CNTs and excretion through biliary pathway, especially via urine and feces. However, few investigations observed that CNTs are degraded in specific environments via natural, enzymatic catalysis, natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with low concentration of H 2 O 2 (approximately 40 mM) at 4 8C over 12 weeks or in the presence of human neutrophil enzyme, myeloperoxidase. Importantly biodegraded nanotubes did not produce any inflammatory response when aspirated in to the lungs of mice [57] [58] [59] . Bianco and co-workers investigated the biodegradation of SWCNTs and MWCNTs under different conditions and concluded that the oxidized MWCNTs were highly degrading in nature as compared to SWCNTs [59] . These few recent literature reports support the biodegradable nature of CNTs, otherwise previously, CNTs were considered non-biodegradable and excreted out as examined by electron microscopic studies. Additionally biocompatible nanotubes could be prepared via conjugation of phospholipids (PL) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains on to them, which may be a promising alternative candidate in biomedical applications [58] [59] [60] .",

In conclusion, before realizing the full potential of CNTs, it is very important to generate data on their safety, efficacy, and feasibility. Although the scientists are optimistic about the possible application of CNTs yet learning the lesson from past (like thalidomide tragedy), the safety and efficacy of CNTs/CNTs based products/devices etc. must be established beyond doubt. We have witnessed the emergence of several materials/devices/products, which could not make their way to market but then that's the research. Let's keep our fingers crossed and wait for the conclusive proof regarding the possible application of CNTs, particularly in biomedical arena.
