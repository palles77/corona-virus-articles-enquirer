Fifteencentimeter lengths of piglet jejunum were flushed with ice-cold norma.l saline, slipped over 5-ml pipettes for identification of Peyer's patches, stripped of muscular and visceral peritoneal layers, and opened into sheets. For light-microscopic studies, segments containing Peyer's patches and adjoining segments without patches were fixed in Bouin's solution, then in 95% ethanol, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For transport studies, adjacent segments were immediately mounted in conventional Ussing chambers (exposing an area of 1.27 cm Z ). Three pairs of tissue segments, each consisting of a patch-containing and a contiguous patch-free segment, were mounted in the chambers, using six chambers for each experiment. Chambers were per-fUSed with oxygenated chamber buffer (Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate, pH 7.4 at 37\u00b0C with 1 mg/ml porcine serum albumin and 3 mM D-glucose). After a 10-min equilibrium period, HRP (Sigma type II, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) was added to the mucosal compartment at a final concentration of 0.5 mM (20 mg/ml); in some experiments [3Bimanriitol, 10 p,Ci/chamber, final concentration 0.5 mM or [ 14 C]polyethylene glycol 4000, 10 p,Ci/chamber, 0.69 mM final concentration, or both, were added to the mucosal chamber also. Preliminary studies had established that neither of these latter two compounds altered HRP transpoit. Serial samples were taken from the serosal reservoir for measurement of the macromolecules added to the mucosal side of the tissue. To eliminate any effects of transmucosal potential difference (PD) on HRP movement, a short-circuiting current was applied throughout the experiment to reduce the PD to zero; PD and the shortcircuiting current were monitored at 10 min. In previous studies (2), we found that HRP did not alter the shortcircuiting current, but HRP transport was -10% higher across short-circuited tissue than across tissue that was not short-circuited.",

A severe lesion characterized by inflammatory exudate and small epithelial ulcerations was seen in 3 pigs; in the other 2 pigs, presumably seen earlier in the evolution of this rapidly progressive disease, there were shortened villi but only minimal epithelial disruption ( Figure  1 ). In pigs studied 96 h after receiving the TGE virus, when diarrhea was severe, the structural findings were identical to those seen previously during the same stage of this disease: shortened villi, deepened crypts, but an intact epithelium. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that, at this 96-h stage of TGE, the virus-infected cells are shed and the epithelium is composed of cells that have migrated up from the crypts at an accelerated rate but in a relatively undifferentiated stage (6) . No alterations could be identified at the light-microscopic level in the dome epithelium overlying Peyer's patches from pigs after infection. .",

Horseradish peroxidase appeared first at 30-40 min and a steady state was maintained between 50 and 80 min when transport rates could be calculated. Mean permeability rates in Peyer's patch-containing and patch-free jejunal segments from control, 12-h, and 96-h TGE piglets are summarized in Figure 2 . In control piglets, the mean rate was 2.6 times higher across patch-containing tissue (p < 0.001) than nonpatch-containing segments. At the early viral invasion stage of TGE, 12 h after infection, peroxidase permeability (free) across patch-free tissue greatly exceeded control values (p < 0.05), and was similar to that occurring in patch-containing tissue from the same group and from controls. By 96 h after TGE infection, although the piglets had a mucosal lesion and diarrhea, peroxidase permeability had returned to normal in non-patch tissue. In patch-containing tissue from these 96-h piglets, HRP permeability actually was reduced compared with controls (p < 0.05), although it remained significantly greater than that occurring in patch-free segments. From the spread of the data summarized in Figure 2 , it is clear that between piglets, variation was much greater in 12-h than in 96-h piglets. Within the 12-h group of piglets, we observed the highest permeation rates in the jejuna judged to have the most severe epithelial disruption, but we could not correlate these rates with any measurable features of the jejunal lesion (i.e., villus height, crypt depth, or mucosal thickness). The lag between addition of HRP to the mucosal chamber and appeara.nce in the serosal chamber tended to be shorter in the group of piglets with severe lesions (0-36 min) than those with milder lesions (39 min), supporting a role for epithelial disruption in increased permeability rates.",

It has been modeled by a group of pores of varying size; most just large enough to admit mannitol, a small fraction large enough to admit PEG, and a still smaller fraction capable of admitting HRP (9) .

Statistical comparison with controls by Student's t-test. Number of animals is given in parentheses. NS, not significant; TGE, transmissible gastroenteritis. alternate pathways. It is unlikely that at the 12-h stage the disease significantly stimulated active processes associated with macromolecular uptake, as our previous experiments showed these processes to be confined to the Peyer's patch regions (2) where the disease had no impact on permeation at 12 h. Altered unstirred water layer resistance, presumed to be greater over nonpatch segments than over the dome epithelium, and therefore more influenced over nonpatch segments by mucosal disease, also could have changed HRP permeation. Again, however, some impact on PEG and mannitol movement would be expected if this mucosal surface phenomenon were a major factor. A relative increase in the vulnerability of 12-h TGE tissue to damage from the in vitro experimental technique, causing an artificial increase in permeability, is also unlikely. Tissues maintained electrical stability during the study period, without increasing conductance, suggesting that tissue integrity was well-preserved in the chambers.",

Permeation of HRP, normal in patch-free segments, indicates that during the diarrheal phase of viral enteritis, the jejunal mucosa is not excessively permeable to the macromolecule. Reduced uptake of the smaller molecules, PEG 4000 and mannitol, at the same stage, could be due to surface area and unstirred water layer changes, even though permeation of the larger and more slowly moving HRP molecule was not similarly affected. The reduced permeation of all three probe molecules through patch-containing segments at 96 h is unlikely to be related to surface area or surface water layer influences, as the epithelium over Peyer's patches was less distorted by this viral enteritis than the epithelium over patch-free segments. Alterations in epithelial uptake or subsequent processing of the probes in the epithelium or in the deeper layers could contribute to this reduced permeation at 96 h. The epithelial basement membrane, which under normal conditions is very porous in the Peyer's patch region (10) , could also be affected by the disease.",

In attempting to explain the many syndromes of persisting diarrhea in young children, it has been postulated that small bowel lesions like viral enteritis might allow enhanced uptake of antigenic ally significant macromolecules, which in turn might stimulate local responses capable of causing ongoing intestinal damage. Our data do not support the concept of a major breakdown in the mucosal barrier to macromolecular absorption during viral diarrhea. Increased permeation appears to occur only during the early hours of the infection when virus disrupts the epithelium and not during diarrhea when the epithelium is relatively undifferentiated but intact. Our findings do not preclude possible ongoing immune-based mucosal damage In response to macromolecular antigens which continue to be taken up in the non-patch-containing regions of the intestine at normal rates throughout the disease.",
