How can decision-makers in health care organizations manage crises better? Rapid and widespread pandemics pose high risks to mortality, health systems, and economies, locally, nationally and globally. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by the newly described coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is one such major emerging health concern. Death occurs in around 65% of all patients, who contract MERS-CoV, resulting from severe acute respiratory infection and multi-organ failure. 1 MERS-CoV outbreaks have occurred in 26 countries across the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America, 3 ,4 yet successful management of MERS-CoV outbreaks is very challenging because, not only does infection most commonly occur in health care workers (HCW) 2 , knowledge of both the causes of the virus and its treatment is preliminary. 3, 4, 5, 6 Most outbreaks to date are attributed to low-adherence to infection control (IC) practices, crowded emergency departments (ED), and slow responsiveness to outbreaks. 7 Consequently, to assist organizational preparedness 8 , more knowledge is needed to guide management of MERS-CoV infection outbreaks. This is especially important given the wide breadth of response needed, which can encompass improving IC practices to providing psychological support to HCWs. 9 A major new outbreak of the MERS-CoV occurred at the King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh (KAMC-R) 10 ; a large teaching hospital and university center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in June 2015. 11 The outbreak resulted in 130 cases of infection (53% mortality rate), directly or indirectly involved 9000 HCWs at the site, and affected all major departments at the institution (table 1) .",

Inevitably, the research was conducted among a select group of participants, and their perspectives may or may not differ from the broader population of staff at the KAMC-R. While independent researchers undertook the interviews, responses may have been influenced by the \"official\" links between the project and the organization.

As these events are also complex, 18 qualitative as well as quantitative research 10 is useful for generating insights and lessons to inform future outbreak control. 18 Useful lessons gleaned from this study of MERS-CoV crisis management (Table 3) concur with other research. It is not just the actions of staff, leaders and decision-makers that contributed to successful management, but also the mutual trust that accrues via the delegation of responsibilities, team management, coordination, tasks distribution, role clarification, and communication. 19, 20 This reflects the practice of collective leadership -defined as \"a dynamic leadership process in which defined leaders, or set of leaders, selectively utilize skills and expertise within a network, effectively distributing elements of the leadership role as the situation or problem at hand requires. 21 This research corroborates others work which identifies that a number of different strands of management contribute to success, particularly, the benefits of centralized yet inclusive meetings during which senior decision-makers and frontline HCWs share knowledge and learning 22 from different parts of the organization. 23 24 25 Other key lessons for crisis management arising from this study arose from the weaknesses around the media management during the outbreak which adversely affected reported staff morale and anxiety. 26 Such challenges are not unusual. 27 Large health institutions managing major crises should have a dedicated media center or representative capable of implementing a well-designed and coordinated media crisis plan to aid communication, address questions and proactively act to protect the reputation of the organization and its staff.",

This was added as the first layer of the patient triage process and implemented in the newly established drive-through system to the ER, and at the entrances of the ACC. Once a patient has entered the main ER, a second screening would take place to identify any possible cases that may have been missed by the first process. Two new teams were formed: CMT, a medical team managing all admitted patients with respiratory illness and CPRT, an outreach team responsible to ensure proper location, testing, transfer, discharge and consultation for suspected and confirmed MERS cases.",

As these events are also complex, 18 qualitative as well as quantitative research 10 is useful for generating insights and lessons to inform future outbreak control. 18 Useful lessons gleaned from this study of MERS-CoV crisis management (Table 3) concur with other research. It is not just the actions of HCWs and decision-makers that contributed to successful management, but also the mutual trust that accrues via the delegation of responsibilities, team management, coordination, tasks distribution, role clarification, and communication. 19, 20 This reflects the practice of collective leadership -defined as \"a dynamic leadership process in which defined leaders, or set of leaders, selectively utilize skills and expertise within a network, effectively distributing elements of the leadership role as the situation 21 This research corroborates other work identifying that a number of different strands of management contribute to success, particularly, the benefits of centralized yet inclusive meetings during which senior decision-makers and frontline HCWs share knowledge and learning 22 from different parts of the organization. 23 24 25 Other key lessons arising from this study arose from the weaknesses around the media management during the outbreak which in turn adversely affected reported staff morale and anxiety. 26 Such challenges are not unusual. 27 Large health institutions managing major crises should have a dedicated media center or representative capable of implementing a well-designed and coordinated media crisis plan to aid communication, address questions and proactively act to protect the reputation of the organization and its staff.",

This was added as the first layer of the patient triage process and implemented in the newly established drive-through system to the ER, and at the entrances of the ACC. Once a patient has entered the main ER, a second screening would take place to identify any possible cases that may have been missed by the first process. Two new teams were formed: CMT, a medical team managing all admitted patients with respiratory illness and CPRT, an outreach team responsible to ensure proper location, testing, transfer, discharge and consultation for suspected and confirmed MERS cases.",

ED and patient triaging transformation ED staff and the military police have controlled all ED entrances, and access was restricted to ED employees. The MERS-CoV plan was implemented aiming to avoid any future occurrences of any infectious diseases. Major changes in the ED workflow were implemented. A drive-through was established at the entrance of the ED with 3 lanes and 4 windows per lane, manned by trained unit assistants to implement the initial triage process. Second, was the establishment of an 18 respiratoryisolation room facility for which patients with a suspected respiratory illness would be isolated and evaluated. Third, was a reducation in patient boarding time.",

This negative coverage contributed to significantly negative public perceptions of the Ministry, KAMC-R, its senior decision-makers, and the frontline HCWs. These negative commentaries were evident across local mass media (television, radio, and newspapers) and social media -particularly Twitter. The negative media reporting was cited as negatively impacting staff morale and affecting workers socially, psychologically, and mentally. During this challenging period, this compounded the negative effects of work demands. Reactive and poor media management by the KAMC-R was seen to contribute to the ongoing frequency and negativity of this commentary. Participants suggested that the institution should have a media center to coordinate media coverage in such emergency circumstances.Staff capacity to handle this challenging situation was further reduced given the perceived wide prevalence of high anxiety in staff due to the \"lack of appropriate staff counseling and mental health support\". The psychological demands on frontline health professionals escalated due to a range of coalescing factors; most notably the need to manage the outbreak simultaneously with the closure of most of the institution's units, combined with the negative media commentary. Almost all frontline participants strongly and repeatedly expressed the need for counseling and mental health support of employees.",

It leads to severe acute respiratory infection with multi-organ failure and has a 65% mortality rate. 1, 2 MERS-CoV outbreaks have now occurred in 26 countries across the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. 2, 3,4Successful management of MERS-CoV outbreaks is very challenging because infection occurs most commonly in health care workers (HCWs) 2 but knowledge of both the causes of the virus and its treatment is still limited.3,4,5,6  Most outbreaks have been attributed to lowadherence to infection control (IC) practices, crowded emergency departments (ED), and slow responsiveness to outbreaks.7  Consequently, to assist organizational preparedness,8,9 more    knowledge is needed to guide future management of MERS-CoV infection outbreaks.",

Moreover, this perceived lack of clear communication created additional confusion that led to low coordination of IC instructions from both IPC and the nursing teams. Consequently, some health professionals, and other administrative and military staff, did not appreciate the severity of the outbreak.Heightening the risk was a notable laxity in controlling the hospital and ED points of entry and visitors entering the institution.All participants referred to consistent \"negative media commentary\" on the MERS outbreak occurring at the KAMC-R. This negative coverage contributed to negative public perceptions of the NGHA, KAMC-R, its senior decision-makers, and the frontline HCWs. These negative commentaries were perceived in the mass media (television, radio, and newspapers), but especially on social media -particularly Twitter. The negative media reporting was cited as negatively impacting staff morale and negatively affecting workers socially, psychologically, and mentally, during a challenging period of work demands. Inadequate or partial media management was seen to contribute to the ongoing presence of negative commentary -and participants suggested that the institution should have a well-established media center to coordinate media coverage in such emergency circumstances.",

So we were\u2026feeling isolated as an organization \u2026To be honest, it -it brought the best in us and the worst in us. The best in us in term of our resilience and our ability to cope. The worst in us is our weaknesses and our insecurities and our dealing with each other\u2026 And there was a lot of international pressure on us\u2026there was a lot of international pressures.You  can understand it doesn't affect National Guard. It affects everything\u2026.So there was a lot of pressure at that time.\" -A very demanding situation \"A lot of the organization do not really -knew what was going on. That we were meeting at nine o'clock in the morning, we're meeting at three o' clock every day\u2026 every day, including weekends. No rest at all.\" Hard and uncertain progress \"We were worried for the staff and we were worried for the patients. And during that time, we were ah, doing five hundred um\u2026 tests. And every day, we come in. And we see the numbers. And so, today we tested 15 positives. Tomorrow, 20. And we were saying, when do we hit an inflection point? When these numbers goes down? And it goes down for a bit, and it comes up. And every time, you just hope to God that this is it\u2026 So the morale was going up and down.\" Transcript 1 (Decision-maker) 5-Teamwork and collaborative management requirement \"We took it very seriously. We know the magnitude. We know the impact of it. We know how this affects the, the patient care and how this affects the reputation of the organization, affects everything. And\u2026the public image and all of this has to be addressed to the Minister. We said (means all leaders) however, it is, it is, it's a must that we\u2026.should do it. \u2026.In spite of all of this stress and difficulties we felt that we need to be focused and address issues scientifically. At the same time you know we have to support people who are working at the frontline. We have to do that, we have to really be there and we know that they are very stressed.\" Factors perceived to contribute to outbreak occurrence 1-Growing reliance on ED Boarding \"\u2026.The organization is well known in the country for many success stories and\u2026that basically put some pressure on the organization of people asking to be treated here\u2026. Third thing is\u2026.our location here as the only big hospital in the East of Riyadh\u2026 Because of the large number and because of the expertise in managing the casualties\u2026Those factors basically, I mean resulted in a huge number of \u2026.. boarding patients in the ED\u2026\u2026 \" \"\u2026It's not something you want to see\u2026.. And when you know, it's because someone didn't wash their hands. That's the bit that killed me. Something simple, it wasn't that we didn't have a Da Vinci (Robotic surgery) in the OR. It's because they didn't wash their hands.\" Factors perceived to contribute to success of outbreak control Transcript 5 (Decision-maker) 1-Collective leadership practice \"The organization is well staffed with very smart, dedicated individuals -across all spectrums \u2026.. And I think that really was what helped out. Middle management, chairmen of departments\u2026. they rose to the equation\u2026. And I think there was tremendous amount of work that was done by some of the Chairmen. I think\u2026it was really\u2026 hard on lot of them\u2026. We just felt, we're not blaming anyone, we just needed one clear goal that we need to get out of it quickly, quickly, as quick as possible\u2026. I think people wanted to prove that they are, they are, they are good. I learned that being close to the management being accessible to management, to to frontline was\u2026good\u2026We hopefully have led from the, form the front.\" For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml BMJ Open",

And there seemed to be a lot more admiration for each other. Yeah, and I think -and that -and it was expressed to me by Doctor ___[Leader]  one day, and I remember the conversation. He said, \"you know, I can't believe that these guys kept turning up.\" You know? [Interviewer: Uhum] And ah, and I -I think we grew a bit of mutual respect for each other, out of the way we handled that, to be honest.\"Factors inhibiting outbreak control 1-Logistic barriers to promptly implement the escalation plan \"We have implemented it (means the IDEP escalation plan) on time, but for example to close the ED it took us time to evacuate it \u2026. the positive cases increased and we were moved from stage to stage\u2026.\"Transcript 1 (Decision maker) \"I was kept very much in the dark as to what was going on\u2026it wasn't transcribed. We were -we were not -we were only\u2026only fed information that we needed to know. So, rather than team debriefing every day, which I would have appreciated, that didn't (happen)\u2026So poor communication. And it -it -almost a hierarchy of who needs to know what. And yet, we were in the frontline.\" \"Well, there was lots of grey\u2026 grey areas\u2026.Ah, would you put a mask ah, throughout the stay, in the aisle -hospital, ah, in the corridors? Would you not do as some people ah, did? \u2026 some people did not ah, do that. There were lots of mixed messages coming from even IPC department. \u2026\u2026 Ah, which confused us, which\u2026 ah, and so there was lots of variations\u2026some people were more conservative. Some people more -were more liberal in doing these things.\"\"Aclear example is dealing with visitors and dealing with the military people\u2026who control the visitors here. And there was a clear miscommunication and \u2026 misunderstanding. You come to them and say, \"Why did you let them (visitors) in?\" You know? They are not really getting it. Ah -I'm -I'm sure. I'm sorry to say that, but that's -that's was one of the biggest challenges I think.. So they were not getting it and it -the higher -the administration \u2026. ranks of the military, was not really getting it. Although they were \u2026 part of the command center.\" \"\u2026The social media put a huge amount of pressure. And of course\u2026some of it \u2026 on reasonable facts and the others are myths basically. Lots for example of talk, of people dying from \u2026. from the health workers. Of course I mean that created pressure. [\u2026 for example I mean had one of our, one of the Chairmen and one of the infection control leaders who, were tested positive but they were basically asymptomatic, but \u2026 what happened in the media (reported they) had died\u2026!\" \"\u2026.We could have done better with the media, I felt very vulnerable, actually.\u2026I felt very vulnerable\u2026.. And that was a huge burden for me\u2026.Big.\" Transcript 10 (Decision-makers) 4-Lack of appropriate staff \"Dr. B\u2026Whenever you see somebody sneeze you're cupping (hands over face). It was scary, stay away. Was just telling (another colleague) that my barber refused to get my hair cut. For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml Dr. C:\u2026.Even in social ah, aspects\u2026the mosque next to my house, I usually go to pray when I like. One day he called me (means the Imam) when I was leaving and said \"You know, we know each other, we are very close neighborhood, so he said, you know the other neighbors\u2026\u2026because of Corona\u2026. so maybe you had better stay away\". Long-term institutional gains in response to the outbreak management P4: I think that the organization has certainly matured. And they have a different outlook on\u2026 on the ED\u2026From the MERS-CoV tragedy\u2026I think that there was a huge wake-up call. And I think it was a steep learning curve through the organization. So they understand now that when ED says\u2026the Chief Nurse or the CEO are receptive. Tangible improvement in infection control practices We -we had a lot of support from Infection Control department\u2026lots of information available. Um, the Infection Control practitioners were on the units day and night, supporting the staff. Management as well\u2026.in terms of supplies, equipment, all of that, we didn't have any issues. It was supplied -readily available. \"\u2026the, the boarding and ah, boarding patients within the ED is not new, it's from 2005-2006. [Interviewer: Yes] but is getting \u2026 every year was getting worse\u2026\u2026. From 170,\u2026.. we have now 56 beds (means after the ED transformation), our efficiency and waiting times, improved significantly because the boarding patient reduced\u2026.. So we know, for us it was very clear the issue wasn't within the department (ED department), it was within the flow of patients within the organization.\"\"But we -just we completely redesigned -not only um, it was complete system -restructure and system redesign \u2026.Um, people were practicing in a way that they've never done before -nurses and doctors\u2026.\"For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml",
