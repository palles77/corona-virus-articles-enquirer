This study aims to evaluate the association between first-line antihypertensive drug class and medication adherence in a large Chinese population. Methods: All patients prescribed \u2265 one antihypertensive drug in 2001-2003 and 2005 who have paid at least two consecutive clinic visits in the public healthcare system of Hong Kong were included. We excluded patients who have followed-up in the clinics for \u2264 30 days. Interval-based Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) was used to assess medication adherence. All patients were followed-up for up to 5 years. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the factors associated with optimal adherence, defined as PDC \u2265 80%. Results: From 147,914 eligible patients, 69.2% were adherent to the antihypertensive prescriptions. When compared with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), patients initially prescribed \u03b1-blockers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.234, 95% C.I. 0.215-0.256), \u03b2-blockers (AOR = 0.447, 95% C.I. 0.420, 0.477), thiazide diuretics (AOR = 0.431 95% C.I. 0.399, 0.466) and calcium channel blockers (AOR = 0.451, 95% C.I. 0.423, 0.481) were significantly less likely to be drug adherers. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and fixed-dose combination therapies were similarly likely to be medication adherent. Older age, male gender, visits in general out-patient clinics, residence in urbanized regions, and the presence of comorbidity were positively associated with optimal drug adherence. Conclusion: Patients receiving initial prescriptions of ACEIs, ARB and combination therapy had more favorable adherence profiles than the other major antihypertensive classes in real-life clinical practice.",

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) however considered all of the major antihypertensive drug classes as equivalent as first-line agents [9] . Their position statements were based on a large number of randomized controlled trials, all of which demonstrated fairly equal efficacy of the major classes of antihypertensive drugs, both in terms of blood pressure reductions and the occurrence of primary cardiovascular end-points [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Nevertheless, the ESC/ESH guideline has also mentioned some limitations of these event-based randomized trials [15] [16] [17] , including the need to select higher risk patients and thus uncomplicated, younger and lower risk patients were under-represented [18] . These therapeutic programs have also been criticized for not representing real clinical practice. Prolonging the observation of patients after the end of trials [19, 20] might capture more \"real-life\" outcomes but these can only be done in an uncontrolled manner, and the problem of selection bias still exists. Thus, the expert group of the ESC/ESH advised that more \"noninterventional\" studies comparing the outcomes of the major antihypertensive classes, including drug adherence, should be performed.",

However, the study included only a modest number of new clinic visitors and patients were sampled from only one region of Hong Kong. Besides, there was no blood pressure levels included as potential confounders in the regression analysis. The duration of patient follow-up was very short, limited to assessment of compliance in two consecutive clinic visits only. The study has used Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) as the outcome measure for drug compliance. But recent evaluations from databases reported that MPR may overstate real adherence, and Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) should be considered instead as it is operationally defined more consistently [22, 23] .",

These newer medications include calcium channel blockers [CCB], ACEIs, angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] and fixed dose combination therapy.

Also, drug dispensations were checked by pharmacists or dispensers from standard protocols and all necessary revisions were recorded in the computerized system. Apart from these good practices, this database has previously been evaluated and possesses a high level of completeness regarding demographic (100%) and prescription information (99.98%) [27] . The present study included all regions in Hong Kong, which has a total population of more than seven million. It is further divided into 3 separate geographical regions, namely Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories, from the most urbanized to the most rural, respectively. This study was approved by the Hospital Authority, the Clinical Ethics Research Committee, and the Surveys and Behavioral Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.",

The overall adherence rate among patients newly prescribed an antihypertensive agent was 79.1%. ACEIs had the highest adherence rates (88.0%) while beta-blockers had significantly lower adherence rates (81.3%) when compared with thiazide diuretics (84.5%). The present study reported much lower adherence levels across all drug classes as compared to the previous study [21] , and we showed that \u03b2-blockers were not inferior to other older antihypertensive agents. A recent retrospective cohort study linking four clinical databases in Ontario [26] studied the adherence profiles of newly treated hypertensive patients. The overall cohort had a high 1-and 2-year MPRs of 94.4% and 96.9%, respectively, and adherence was significantly better with ACEIs (AOR 1.17, 95% C.I. 1.10-1.25) and worse with betablockers (AOR 0.79, 95% C.I. 0.73-0.86) when compared with diuretics. The study also identified factors of poor adherence, including male gender, old age, urban residence, and the presence of at least one comorbidity. On the contrary, the majority of other studies in Western countries had similar findings with the current study. For instance from a real practice analysis in Italy [28] , poorer adherence was associated with younger age and female gender among both incident and prevalent hypertensive patients. The absence of comorbid cardiac diseases was associated with poorer medication adherence among incident elderly hypertensives [29] . In two other studies using the Department Veterans Affairs' Pharmacy database [30, 31] , younger age and the absence of comorbidities were positively associated with lower adherence. A retrospective medical and pharmacy claims data for Maryland Medicaid patients found that younger age and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were associated with lower adherence, yet the prescription of combination therapies favored medication adherence [24] . Most other similar studies reported higher levels of adherence among patients prescribed ACEIs, CCBs or angiotensin receptor blockers [30, [32] [33] [34] than those prescribed diuretics and beta-blockers. In summary, the risk factors for poor medication adherence evaluated in this study were compatible with those from the majority of international literature, but the noninferiority of beta-blockers, as well as the superiority of combination therapy, ARBs and ACEIs as first-line antihypertensive agents were novel findings among ethnic Chinese individuals.",

Younger patients were less likely to be adherent, where we postulate that this might be due to their busy working schedule, or they were in general less health conscious than older patients. It is however unknown why female patients were less adherent than male subjects, and as we previously mentioned [21] current literature is rather mixed on the association between gender and medication adherence [40] . In addition, it is not surprising to find that higher blood pressure was associated with poorer compliance, as the effect of suboptimal compliance on poorer blood pressure control has been widely recognized [6] [7] [8] . For the drug class differences, there existed few comparative data on the major antihypertensive drug classes in Chinese patients. As highlighted by Friedman and colleagues [26] , the reasons for differences in medication adherence across drug classes were likely multifactorialranging from drug tolerability, dosing frequency, and patient perceived adverse effects as potential contributors.",

However, it also stated as one of its important position statements that the choice of first-line agents should depend on many factors, including anticipated compliance profiles. The guideline also contains extensive descriptions of the advantages of combination therapy. These include better blood pressure and complication control; lower dosage of either drugs used in the combination therapy and thus fewer incidences of side effects; and the feasibility in some regions that two agents can be administered in a single tablet. Therefore, in conjunction with our findings, we would recommend combination therapy, ARBs, and ACEIs as potentially more favorable first-line options in the management of arterial hypertension among antihypertensive-naive patients.",

It involved a large number of patients newly prescribed different antihypertensive drug classes, observed for longer periods of 5-10 years. Its inclusion of all regions of Hong Kong enhances its representativeness and generalizability. We captured data from real-life clinical practice which could better reflect the reality than interventional trials. Also, the robustness of the clinical database, its completeness and the good dispensing practices further increased the reliability of the findings. However, some limitations should be mentioned. Firstly, we used PDC as the metric to assess medication adherence, although this has been internationally recognized as a measure in retrospective database analysis [22, 23] . Critics might argue that patients were not actually taking the drugs that were dispensed. In addition, the reasons why adherence was poorer in some specific patient groups could not be further evaluated from the current dataset. Also, there might exist other confounders for medication adherence, such as educational attainment [25] , depressive symptoms [41] , the presence of stressful life events [41] and patient beliefs and behavior [42] .",

Recent initiatives for designing and implementing community-based, adherence-promoting programs should be more focused. It is anticipated that their target towards younger patients, female subjects, residents in more rural regions, and those without concomitant comorbidities could lead to better cost-effectiveness. The relatively low, although not too inferior, adherence level of beta-blockers is compatible with guideline recommendations [6] on their conservative views of beta-blockers as firstline agents. Combination therapy, ARBs and ACEIs might be more favorable among Chinese patients based on adherence profiles, and this conclusion could be further strengthened by further evaluations between drug class and clinical outcomes in non-interventional settings. Future research should also explore whether better medication adherence as assessed by PDC is related to lower health service utilization and reduced rates of morbidity and mortality, as well as the unexplained difference in compliance profiles according to age and gender [40] .",
