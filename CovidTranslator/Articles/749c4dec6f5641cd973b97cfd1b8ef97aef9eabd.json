It has occurred in three huge pandemics since the 6 th century with millions of deaths and numerous smaller epidemics and sporadic cases. Referring to specific clinical symptoms of pulmonary plague the disease became known as the Black Death. This pandemic probably originated in central Asia and began spreading westward along major trade routes. Upon the arrival in the eastern Mediterranean the disease quickly spread especially by sea traffic to Italy, Greece and France and later throughout Europe by land. Until the 18 th century many European cities were frequently affected by other great plague epidemics. The worldwide spread of the third pandemic began when the plague reached Hong Kong and Canton in the year 1894. The gram-negative coccobacillus now designated as Yersinia pestis has been discovered as the causative agent of plague in this Hong Kong outbreak. In the following years the role of rats and fleas and their detailed role in the transmission of plague has been discovered and experimentally verified. Today the plague is still endemic in many countries of the world.",

Another important report of possible plague is given by Rufus of Ephesus in the first century of our time. He describes the outbreak of an epidemic causing buboes and states its occurrence in Libya, Syria and Egypt. He also cites other reports of the plague dating back to about 300 years before our time that are now lost (Haeser, 1882, p. 15f; Sticker, 1908, p. 20f ). In the recent literature there are doubts whether this epidemic is caused by plague or plague alone. Generally it is very difficult or in many cases impossible to give a clear diagnosis from descriptions of antique authors. At that time probably other infectious diseases such as smallpox or typhus caused epidemics and the symptoms of the final state of these untreatable diseases were similar (Bergdolt, 2000, p. 12ff ).",

In his theory inhalation of air fouled by putrid exhalations coming from different sources such as swamps lead to epidemic diseases. He has developed these ideas in his work \u2122De febrium differentis\u222b in the second century and they played an important role throughout the whole Middle Ages (Hirst, 1953, p. 37f) . Galen also said that contact with exhalations of plague cases is also dangerous. Therefore the correct observation that plague and other epidemic diseases can be transmitted between persons has imperfectly been integrated in a theory of disease which assumes that diseases are manifestations of false mixtures of the four body fluids (blood, phlegm, choler or yellow bile). But this transmission via exhalation of plague agents was not regarded as the most important way. Well beyond the Middle Ages there had been a lengthy discussion what exactly can be regarded as putrid exhalation (Bergdolt, 2000 , p. 21ff, Leven, 1997 Hirst, 1953, p. 46) .",

For example, the plague epidemic of Florence in the year 1348 is described by Giovanni Boccaccio (1313 \u00b1 1375) in his famous book \u2122Decamerone\u222b. The plague began spreading again probably from the Himalayas westward along three major trade routes from the years 1332 (?) to 1346. The introduction into Europe in the year 1347 resulted in the start of the first epidemic of the second pandemic that was active until the year 1352. This epidemic again encompassed all of the \u2122known world\u222b at that time and later became known as the Black Death. Even the island of Greenland in the North Atlantic was effected (Haeser, 1882, p. 97f; Sticker, 1908, p. 42f) . Upon the arrival in the eastern Mediterranean the disease quickly spread especially by sea traffic to Italy, Greece and France, and later throughout Europe by land (Table 1 ). In the outbreaks in medieval towns often several tens of thousands of people died. It is reported that in Venice alone 100,000 inhabitants died of plague, in Paris 50,000 to 80,000 and in London about 100,000. In Genoa at least 40,000 people died which equals about half the population of that time (Haeser, 1882, p. 97f ). These figures may be exaggerated symbolic numbers but they testify the immense impression of the catastrophe upon the minds of the people (Aberth, 2001, 109f) .",

Despite the high mortality of this Black Death epidemic, the most devastating effects resulted from the numerous following outbreaks and greater epidemics that continued into the early 18 th century, although not as frequent as in the 14 th and 15 th century. Between the years 1349 and 1665 only a few decades remain without a plague epidemic. In most cases they originate from residual foci and in some cases the plague was reintroduced easterly (Sticker, 1908, p. 74) . It is documented that there were great regional variations in the severity of the death rate (Bean, 1982) . To fight the Black Death measures such as burning fires in the streets and in the houses, using aromatic substances (both to fight putrid exhalations) and also making barriers or just flight was recommended for prophylaxis (Haeser, 1882, p. 183f ). At the time of the Black Death and the following centuries the real cause of the disease remained unknown and beside the concepts developed by Galen and other physicians of the antique it was attributed among others to unfavourable constellations of stars, to comets and to the wrath of supernatural powers (Aberth, 2001, 109f; Leven, 1997, p. 20f) . Following the epidemic of the Black Death many cities introduced quarantine measurements to avoid plague epidemics. The name quarantine is based on the forty day restrictions on travel imposed in Marseille in the year 1384 (Leven, 1997, p. 31 ). In the 17 th century a \u2122protective\u222b clothing was invented consisting of a long cape and a mask While investigating fermentation Louis Pasteur discovered that bacteria in wine can be eliminated by treating them with heat. This procedure is now known as pasteurisation 1876",

The second pandemic is believed to have induced great changes in society, economics, politics, and science (Haeser, 1882, p. 183f; Roedig, 1996) . Existing economic and social problems were severely intensified due to the great demographic losses even many years after the first epidemic. On the one hand plague fatalities in the town led to shortcuts in many handicrafts and resulted in an inflow of rural inhabitants to replace these losses. This inflow and changes in the social structure (and social power of craftsmen) led to many conflicts. On the other hand a relative overproduction of agricultural products in the years following the epidemic and structural changes in agriculture caused severe social and economic problems in the rural population. Details of these and many other complex changes and conflicts due to the plague are subject to continuous scientific research and discussion (Bergdolt, 2000, p. 191 \u00b1 207; Zinn, 1989, p. 150f; Aberth, 2001, 109f) . The great losses of population due to the plague (and for other reasons such as war, famine, and other contagious diseases) probably were also the reason that themes such as the apocalypse, \u2122ars morieni\u222b (the art of dying) and \u2122the dance of death\u222b became an important part in art and literature of that time (Schneider et al., 1991; Roedig, 1996) . This is especially true for the \u2122the dance of death\u222b-theme which probably evolved a few year after the great first epidemic (Bergdolt, 2000, p. 207 \u00b1 218) . The importance of these aforementioned themes is documented for example in many medieval paintings, woodcuts or in block book prints. Medieval block books (incunabula xylographica) were printed from woodblocks without using single types. They were predominantly made in the middle of the 15 th century (Schneider et al., 1991) . Figure 2 is depicting a page of a block book edition of the apocalypse printed around 1465. Figure 3 shows a woodcut of the book \u2122Ars morieni\u222b printed ca. 1497 and Figure 4 depicts the woodcut \u2122the dance of death\u222b from the Latin edition of the Nuremberg Chronicle of 1493.",

            "text": "Since the 14 th century the British Isles were affected by numerous smaller and greater plague epidemics similar to the countries of the European continent. At a national scale at least eighteen outbreaks can be identified between the years 1348 and 1485. From the late 15 th century when national and urban population began to rise again plague continued to take a heavy toll (Porter, 2000, p. 13f ). In the last years the plague on the British Isles has been topic of many investigations, especially on the time interval between the 16 th and 17 th century. For example, attempts to install effective quarantine measures and the planning and building of pest-houses in different parts of the island are well documented. Based upon an Italian model bills of mortality were introduced, to provide warning of a threatening outbreak and allow measures to be put in place. In 1519 the earliest London Bill was compiled and from the early 1610s onwards the weekly bills were printed, making them widely available (Porter, 2000, p. 15f ). In the year 1665 London was struck by a great plague epidemic after several years of a low number of plague cases with a first focus at the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields close to the western edge of the town. In June the number of deaths documented in the London Bills had been doubled compared to Fig. 2 . Single page of a mediaeval block book on the apocalypse printed around 1465 (edition Schreiber IV). All pages of this copy were coloured by hand. The book contains pictures and short texts describing mainly the revelation of St. John (Johannes Apostolus) given in the last chapter of the new testament. The scene depicted here is the pouring out of the seventh bowl by an angel bringing earthquakes and hail over mankind. Towns are destroyed, mountains were lost and islands sink (Apc. XVI, 17 \u00b1 21; cf. Schneider et al., 1991) . Reproduced with permission from a copy of the state and university library of G\u02c6ttingen (signature 48 Th bib 1060/31 Rara). the figures of the previous years. Since the outbreak was obvious to the people they began to avoid public places and to leave the town if possible (Porter, 2000, p. 33f ). In October 1665, plague fatalities began to decline and reached a low level in January of the following year. The annual bill for 1665 lists a number of 97,306 deaths in total and 68,596 deaths caused by the plague. Due to imperfections and movements of population it can be estimated that in London and adjacent parishes 70,000 to 100,000 persons died of plague which equals 15 % to 20 % of the population before the outbreak (Porter, 2000, p. 33f) . The epidemic also spread to the provinces including smaller towns such as Colchester with roughly half of the 11,000 inhabitants dying of plague until September of the following year. Other badly affected towns were, for example, Cambridge, Norwich, Harwich, and Southampton. Some other towns only suffered from a few cases such as Bristol which had acted promptly to prevent anyone from London entering the city (Porter, 2000, p. 79f ). The severe impact of the plague epidemic was also reflected in sharp falls in production and trade worsened by a great fire in London and the war with the Dutch (Porter, 2000, p. 114f) . The outbreak and its impact on the people are well documented, for example, in the famous diary of Samuel Pepys (1633 \u00b1 1703), the secretary to the admiralty in the reigns of Charles II. and James II, first published in 1825 in selections (Pepys, 1971 (Pepys, \u00b1 1983 (Pepys, and 1980 Porter, 2000, p. 146f ). In 1722 Daniel Defoe It intends to teach a method of overcoming the temptations of life and of putting to flight the devils that recommended them. In this woodcut several demons surround the bed, and three get ready to lend a crown to the dying man as a symbol for false fame. In the background are God father, Christ and the community of the holy ones to save the soul of the man portrayed as a naked child (cf. Schneider et al., 1991) . Reproduced with permission from a copy of the state and university library of G\u02c6ttingen (signature 88 Th Mor 204/65 Inc Rara). (1660(?) \u00b1 1731) published an imaginative reconstruction of the London outbreak named \u2122A journal of the plague year\u2122 (Porter, 2000, p. 163f; Defoe, 1990) . In continental Europe three major plague corridors along which plague epidemics moved in the 16 th to early 18 th century can be identified. The first route linked the Low Countries with the Rhineland, the second ran parallel to the rivers Weser and Elbe linking north-western Germany to Bohemia. The third important corridor was along the coastal region of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. Since the middle of the 17 th century generally there can be seen a reduction in plague activity in this area (Eckert, 2000) .",

For example there is a monograph on the plague written in German by the famous physician Hieronymus Brunschwig (ca 1450 \u00b1 ca 1512) issued in the year 1500 ( Figure 5 ). The book contains on 80 pages a description of plague symptoms, on how to distinguish between affected und unaffected persons, how to treat \u2122bubones carbunculus\u222b und the disease itself and what preventive measures such as medication and correct food can be used. Of course, at that time there was no effective treatment and plague was not recognized as an infective disease in the modern view, although some hygienic measures like quarantine were frequently used. The books offer several recipes for prophylactic medication which are called \u2122medication to strengthen heart and nature\u222b. These medicines contained herbal plants and sometimes mineral substances such as \u2122Tormentillen wurtzeln\u222b, \u2122Tormentillen wasser\u222b (roots and extract probably of Potentilla erecta), and \u2122Bibinelle wurzel\u222b (roots of Pimpinella spec.) among many others. The section of how to treat and care for people with plague is much shorter but some recommendations are given, too (Brunschwig, 1500; Sudhoff, 1908) .",

            "text": "In the 16 th and the 17 th century and even well into the 18 th century numerous books and tracts on the plague and other \u2122fevers\u222b were published but only a few have contributed significantly to medical progress. The first complete theory of infection had been developed by Girolamo Fracastoro (1478 \u00b1 1553 and it was published in the year 1546. He proposed a theory of infective agents of minute size, called \u2122seminaria contagionis\u222b. In his theory the seminaria caused a spoiling of the substance and were transferred by minute particles. He did not regard the seminaria as organisms but as particles with material and spiritual properties. In contrast to poisons the seminaria should be able to generate in affected persons (Fracastoro, 1546 and 1910; Leven, 1997, 36f) . Although his seminaria look similar to our concept of microorganisms they can not be regarded as the same (Hirst, 1953, p. 47f; Leven, 1997, p. 36f ). In the year 1658, Athanasius Kircher (1602 \u00b1 1680) made the first explicit claim to an observation of a microorganism causing plague in blood of febrile patients given in his book \u2122Scrutinium physico-medicum contagiosae luis, quae pestis dicitur.\u222b (Figure 6 ). He added that these corpuscles were lifeless at first and they were then changed into little invisible worms by heat from the contaminated air. It has to be taken into account that Kircher still believed in spontaneous generation (Kircher, 1658; Hirst, 1953, p. 79f; Leven, 1997, p. 65f) . Due to the resolution of the used microscope he was not able to detect bacteria and he possibly had observed clotted blood cells (Hirst, 1953, p. 79f) . With the development of efficient microscopes the Dutch Antoni van Leeuwenhoek (1632 Leeuwenhoek ( \u00b1 1723 was the first to undoubtedly discover living bacteria in the year 1674 beside of his many other discoveries in the microcosm. He published his various descriptions in a long series of letters to the Royal Society of London (van Leeuwenhoek, 1686 Leeuwenhoek, \u00b1 1702 cf. Hirst, 1953, p. 79; Leven, 1997, p. 68f) . About one hundred years later Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729 \u00b1 1799) was able to demonstrate that infusoria do not generate spontaneously (Spallanzani, 1776; Leven, 1997, p. 69) . Again one hundred years later Louis Pasteur (1822 \u00b1 1895) proved that bacteria do not generate spontaneously by demonstrating that contamination of beer is caused by microorganisms found in the air (Pasteur, 1876; Leven, 1997, p. 96f) and he was also able to treat a bacterial wine disease by heating (Pasteur, 1866) . After the discovery of Bacillus anthracis as the causative agent of anthrax by Robert Koch (1843 Koch ( \u00b1 1910 in the year 1876 and many other pathogens in the following years the widespread theory of a miasmatic cause of disease was replaced by the foundation of a scientific bacteriology (Eckart, 1994, p. 228ff ).",

The disease was quickly disseminated all over the world affecting all inhabited continents (Hirst, 1953, p. 101f; Kupferschmidt, 1993, p. 14f ). The next countries hit were Japan, Formosa (today Taiwan) and the border region of today's Iran and Pakistan. Bombay was affected in the year 1896 and the disease quickly spread to many parts of India from that focus. Other imported epidemics were seen in South America, South Africa and western North America (Kupferschmidt, 1993, p. 14f) . In India alone, which had been severely affected, a total of 12.5 million Indians are estimated to have died of plague between 1898 and 1918 (Perry and Fetherston, 1997) .",

About the same time Alex-andreYersin (1863 \u00b1 1943 was dispatched by the French colonial minister on a similar mission. Both arrived in Hong Kong in June 1894, with the Japanese commission several days earlier. Both discovered almost immediately a new kind of bacterium in specimens of plague patients and were able to culture it. Both also found the same bacteria in organs of dead rats from the plague area (Hirst, 1953, p. 106f; Kupferschmidt, 1993, p. 21f) . Possibly Kitasato was the first to describe the new microorganism (a few days ahead) and a preliminary note appeared in The Lancet of 25 th August 1894 (Kitasato, 1894) . On the other hand, the description of Yersin is more accurate with all striking characteristics well emphasized (Yersin, 1894; Butler, 1983, p. 9f; Gross, 1995; Solomon, 1995 and and there can be not doubt that his organism was Yersinia pestis (Hirst, 1953, p. 106f; Kupferschmidt, 1993, p. 21f) . In contrary to Kitasato Yersin correctly described the bacterium as gram-negative. Kitasato incorrectly described the nonmotile bacterium as slightly motile whereas Yersin did not mention this point at all. Therefore there can be doubts whether Kitasato has correctly identified Y. pestis. But he may also have suffered from technical insufficiencies for example in his staining methods (Hirst, 1953, p. 106f; Kupferschmidt, 1993, p. 21f) . Following the first reports there was a series of confusing statements and self-contradictions by Kitasato and his colleagues that tended to discredit his claim to have been the co-discoverer of the plague bacillus (Butler, 1983, p. 9f) . There are hints that some of his samples were contaminated with Streptococcus pneumoniae producing these inconsistent results (Butler, 1983, p. 9f; Solomon, 1997) . In the following 80 years there had been a lengthy dispute on whom the first description should be ascribed (Butler, 1983, p. 9f; Kupferschmidt, 1993, p. 21f; Solomon, 1995 and . Figure 7 depicts the original plate of Yersin's article with different microscopic views published in the Annales de l'Institute Pasteur. The microorganism casing plague has undergone several nomenclature changes: Bacterium pestis until 1900, Bacillus pestis until 1923, Pasteurella pestis (after Yersin's mentor), and, finally, Yersinia pestis since 1970 (Perry and Fetherston, 1997; Butler, 1983, p. 9f ). These nomenclature changes were due to changing taxonomical classifications (Bercovier and Mollaret, 1984; Williams, 1983; Butler, 1983, p. 9f ).",

            "text": "In the last decade of the 19 th century several researchers were convinced of an association between the plague of rats and human beings although the detailed way of transmission was not known. Epidemiological details of plague outbreaks gave clear hints to that assumption (Kupferschmidt, 1993, p.55f) . A proposal that fleas may play a role in the transmission of plague among other ways of transmission was published in the year 1897 by Masanori Ogata based on his researches into the spread of plague in Taiwan in 1896. In an experiment he was able to show that an emulsion of internal organs of dead fleas from plague-infected rats injected subcutaneously was able to infect mice (Ogata, 1897; Hirst, 1953, p. 161; Kupferschmidt, 1993, p. 65) . After research on the Indian epidemic Paul-Louis Simond (1858 \u00b1 1947 proposed the central role of the flea in plague transmission in the year 1898, although he was not able to give an indubitable experimental evidence of this theory. He had deducted this theory mostly by explaining epidemiological details of plague outbreaks (Simmond, 1898; Gross, 1995; Hirst, 1953, p. 152f; Kupferschmidt, 1993, p. 66f) . The most important evidence of Simmonds theory was given by J. C. Gauthier and A. Raybaud who could show that plague can be transmitted between two rats without direct body contact by fleas. The rats were placed separated in mesh cages that were permissible by fleas. They used two different flea species in this experiment in the year 1902 in Marseille (Gauthier and Raybaud 1903; Hirst, 1953, p. 162; Kupfer-Fig. 7 .

A previous but less elaborated experiment with two rats and two mice and cat fleas by Simmond had only given two positive and two negative results (Hirst, 1953, p. 152f ). The specific transmission mode of fleas was discovered by Charles James Martin (1866 Martin ( \u00b1 1955 and Arthur William Bacot (1866 Bacot ( \u00b1 1922 while studying suckling fleas. They found that some of the fleas had proventriculi that were obstructed with a solid culture of plague bacteria (Bacot and Martin, 1914) . These fleas turned out to be the most efficient vector of the infection especially when the obstruction was partially autolysed. The importance of the blocking for transmission and the anatomical preconditions for it also explained the varying importance of different species of ectoparasites in transmitting plague (Kupferschmidt, 1993, p. 80f; Hirst, 1953, p. 184f ).",
