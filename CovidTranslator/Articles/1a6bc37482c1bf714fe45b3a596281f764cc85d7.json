            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a human-pathogenic flavivirus that has recently emerged as a global public health threat. ZIKV infection may be associated with congenital malformations in infected fetuses and severe neurological and systemic complications in infected adults. There are currently limited treatment options for ZIKV infection. AR-12 (OSU-03012) is a celecoxib derivative cellular kinase inhibitor that has broad-spectrum antiviral activities. In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity and mechanism of AR-12 against ZIKV. We evaluated the in vitro anti-ZIKV activity of AR-12, using cell protection and virus yield reduction assays, in multiple clinically relevant cell lines, and the in vivo treatment effects of AR-12 in a lethal mouse model using type I interferon receptordeficient A129 mice. AR-12 inhibited ZIKV strains belonging to both the African and Asian/American lineages in Huh-7 and/or neuronal cells. AR12's IC 50 against ZIKV was consistently < 2 \u03bcM in these cells. ZIKV-infected A129 mice treated with intraperitoneally or orally administered AR-12 had significantly higher survival rate (50.0%-83.3% vs 0%, P < 0.05), less body weight loss, and lower blood and tissue ZIKV RNA loads than untreated control A129 mice. These anti-ZIKV effects were likely the results of down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by AR-12. Clinical trials using the clinically available and broad-spectrum AR-12 as an empirical treatment should be considered especially for patients residing in or returning from areas endemic of ZIKV and other arboviral infections who present with an acute undifferentiated febrile illness.",

For example, ZIKV infection may manifest as an acute febrile illness with rash and systemic upset which may be indistinguishable from dengue fever and other viral hemorrhagic fever syndromes (Chan et al., 2016b; Duffy et al., 2009 ). Moreover, ZIKV may co-circulate with other viruses in the same geographical regions and co-infect the same patient (Musso and Gubler, 2016) . As in the case of most other emerging viral infections, there are currently limited treatment options proven to be effective and safe for ZIKV infection. Thus, broad-spectrum agents that can be used as empirical treatment for patients with an acute undifferentiated febrile illness before the diagnosis is confirmed by laboratory tests are urgently needed.",

For example, host cellular kinases have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of viral infections as they may be exploited by viruses to facilitate their own replication (Chu and Yang, 2007; Linero and Scolaro, 2009; Saeed et al., 2008; Urata et al., 2012) . For flaviviruses, the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway has been shown to enhance viral replication through counteracting virus-induced cellular apoptosis (Lee et al., 2005; Tsai et al., 2014) . AR-12 (OSU-03012), an FDA-approved investigational new drug (IND) compound, is a celecoxib derivative kinase inhibitor that does not inhibit cyclooxygenase activity, but instead downregulates the PI3K/Akt pathway which are involved in multiple cell signaling pathways (Chen et al., 2017; Mohr et al., 2015) . AR-12 has been evaluated in phase I clinical trials as an anticancer agent in adult patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors or lymphoma (Clinical Trials registration no. NCT00978523).",

These microbes included intracellular bacteria (Salmonella enterica and Francisella tularensis), fungi (Candida albicans, non-albicans Candida sp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Fusarium sp., mucorales, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Coccidioides immitis), parasite (Leishmania donovani), and viruses (Lassa, Marburg, and Ebola viruses) (Chiu et al., 2009a; Chiu et al., 2009b; Collier et al., 2016; Koselny et al., 2016; Mohr et al., 2015) . Importantly, the European Commission has designated AR-12 as an orphan drug that could be used clinically in combination with other anti-infective agents for treatment of cryptococcosis (with fluconazole) and tularemia (with gentamicin) (Booth et al., 2016) . These clinical experiences make AR-12 a clinically readily available drug for emerging infectious diseases lacking effective treatment options. Recently, AR-12 was reported to have in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against dengue virus (DENV), another flavivirus that is closely related to the emerging ZIKV (Chen et al., 2017; Hassandarvish et al., 2017) . We therefore hypothesized that this broad-spectrum host-targeting antiviral drug may also exhibit inhibitory activity against ZIKV. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity of AR-12 against ZIKV and investigated the mechanism of AR-12's anti-ZIKV activity.",

Briefly, U251 cells were infected with ZIKV-PR at 0.50 MOI or were mock-infected for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After 1 h, the inoculum was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 3 \u03bcM AR-12 or 1% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA) was then added to the cells. At 24 hpi, the cells were detached by using 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)/PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. For immunostaining, the cells were first permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then blocked with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS. ZIKV was detected with a mouse anti-ZIKV-NS1 primary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) or the mouse anti-pan-flavivirus primary antibody 4G2 (Millipore) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (IgG) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as the secondary antibody. Flow cytometry was performed using a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and the data were analyzed using FlowJo vX (Tree Star). Fig. 1 . AR-12 inhibits the replication of ZIKV strains belonging to both the Asian/American and African lineages in Huh-7 cells. Dose-dependent reduction of ZIKV RNA load was observed at 24 h after ZIKV-PR, ZIKV-GD, or ZIKV-U inoculation (0.05 MOI) in Huh-7 cells with 0-3 \u03bcM AR-12.

The CC 50 , IC 50 , and selectivity index of AR-12 in U251 cells were 6.99 \u03bcM, 0.84 \u03bcM, and 8.32, respectively, and those in SF268 cells were 11.00 \u03bcM, 1.18 \u03bcM, and 9.32, respectively. The antiviral activity of AR-12 against ZIKV was confirmed even at high MOI by both qRT-PCR and plaque assays (Fig. 5) . We next further evaluated the impact of AR-12 on the antigen expression of ZIKV-PR in neuronal cells with flow cytometry (Fig. 6) . Remarkably, our result demonstrated that AR-12 significantly inhibited the expression of both the envelope protein (Fig. 6A ) and non-structural protein 1 (Fig. 6B ) of ZIKV-PR in the infected cells. The inhibition was evidenced by the reduction in the percentage of positive cells (Fig. 6C) as well as the reduction in the mean fluorescent intensity (Fig. 6D) .",

Moreover, the mean ZIKV RNA loads in the blood and necropsied tissues of these AR-12-treated mice at necropsy were generally 0.8-1.5 logs lower than those of the untreated mice (Fig. 7C) . We also evaluated regimens of delayed administration of AR-12 either intraperitoneally or by oral gavage to ZIKV-infected mice at 48 hpi to more closely mimic clinical situations in which viremic patients do not receive treatment immediately after infection. The improved clinical and virological parameters were more obvious in the mice treated with the oral regimen, which consisted of a much higher dose (200 mg/kg) of AR-12 than the intraperitoneal regimen (25 mg/kg) (Fig. 7) . These findings illustrated that AR-12 not only inhibited ZIKV in vitro, but also in vivo, especially if given early or at a high dose.",

Surprisingly, in contrast to this previous report, we did not find AR-12 to be downregulating GRP-78 (Fig. 8A) . Instead, we found that AR-12 substantially downregulated the phosphorylation of the Akt protein (Fig. 8B) . In this regard, our data suggested that AR-12 potentially inhibited ZIKV replication by negatively regulating the Akt signaling pathway. To further investigate if the Akt signaling pathway modulated ZIKV replication, we treated ZIKV-infected Huh-7 cells with an Akt inhibitor, Akt inhibitor VIII, which has been previously shown to inhibit Akt activation (Lindsley et al., 2005) . Interestingly, our result demonstrated that ZIKV replication was significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited in the presence of Akt inhibitor VIII (Fig. 8C) . The involvement of the Akt signaling pathway in ZIKV replication was further validated with siRNA knockdown (Fig. 8D) . Akt knockdown resulted in a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in ZIKV replication, which was in agreement with the result of the Akt inhibitor VIII experiment (Fig. 8E) . Taken together, these findings suggested that AR-12 inhibits ZIKV replication through downregulation of the Akt signaling pathway.",

The anti-ZIKV activity of AR-12 was then validated in multiple cell types, including neuronal cells which are clinically relevant for the neurotropic ZIKV. Importantly, type I interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice treated with AR-12 (either early or delayed regimen) had significantly higher survival rates and lower viral loads than untreated mice, suggesting that the anti-ZIKV effect of AR-12 was not only present in vitro, but also in a lethal animal model.

The CC 50 of AR-12 was higher in Vero cells (65.90 \u03bcM) than in our Huh-7 and neuronal cells, suggesting that the selectivity index of AR-12 against flaviviruses may be even higher in other cell types (up to > 100) (Hassandarvish et al., 2017) . In DENV-infected suckling mice treated with AR-12 intracranially and intraperitoneally, there was about 0.5-0.7 log reduction in infectious virus particles (plaque forming units) in their brain tissues (Chen et al., 2017) . In comparison, virus-targeting drugs often achieve a higher degree of viral load reduction (> 2 logs) in vitro and in vivo. For example, the ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease inhibitor novobiocin reduces ZIKV RNA load by \u2265 2 logs both in vitro (Vero and Huh-7 cells) and in the blood and tissues of ZIKV-infected mice (Yuan et al., 2017) . Our recently described antiviral peptide (Z2 peptide) targeting the stem region of the ZIKV envelope protein to inhibit virus entry into host cells significantly reduced viral RNA load in ZIKV-infected interferon receptor-deficient mice and inhibited vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant C57BL/6 mice (Yu et al., 2017) . These findings are not unexpected as our mice only received one dose of AR-12 treatment post- Fig. 8 . AR-12 inhibits ZIKV replication via down-regulation of Akt. AR-12 did not downregulate the expression of GRP-78 (A), but reduced Akt phosphorylation (B). Addition of Akt Inhibitor VIII (C) significantly reduced ZIKV RNA load. Similarly, Akt siRNA used in this study downregulated the expression levels of Akt and pAkt (D) and significantly reduced ZIKV RNA load (E). All experiments were performed in triplicates in three independent experiments for confirmation. * denotes P < 0.05 and ** denotes P < 0.01 (compared with the DMSO or scramble siRNA control groups by Student's t-test). Data in Fig. 8C and E are presented as mean values \u00b1 standard deviations (error bars). Abbreviations: Akt, protein kinase B; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; GRP-78, 78 kDA glucose-regulated protein; NS1, nonstructural protein 1; pAkt, phosphorylated protein kinase B; ZIKV, Zika virus. infection and because AR-12's antiviral mechanism via downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is not as direct as those of virustargeting drugs.",
