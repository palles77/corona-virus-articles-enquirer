Female rats of substrain A gained 2 g per day and males gained 7 g. Female rats of substrain B gained 5 g per day and males gained 8 g. Animals were implanted with a stainless steel guide cannula, allowing ICV injections into the lateral ventricle. ICV injections of 1, 5, or 10 /xg of oxytocin or isotonic saline in a volume of 5 /~1 were given. In females, ICV treatment with either saline or 5 p~g of oxytocin caused a transient loss of weight within 24 h of treatment. However, in the more slowly growing females of substrain A depression in body weight was observed after a single treatment with saline, whereas the body weight of oxytocin-treated females showed less marked depression and rapidly returned to the pretreatment weight. After a 3-day treatment period an even greater difference in daily weight gain was seen between oxytocin-treated and saline-treated female rats of substrain A. In contrast, no difference in daily weight gain or food intake was observed between oxytocin-and saline-treated male rats of substrain A, nor in females or males of the more rapidly growing substrain B. Intraperitoneal injections of 5 /~g of oxytocin did not influence food intake or daily weight gain in female rats of substrain A. These data suggest that oxytocin may act centrally to influence food intake and daily weight gain in slowly growing female Sprague-Dawley rats.",

The suckling stimulus seems to be of importance for these effects and suckling can even stimulate food intake and weight gain in animals in which the milk ducts have been ligated to inhibit the outflow of milk (8, 10) . The neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying the lactational hyperphagia are not known. Prolactin, which is released by suckling, is a possible mediator of this effect because peripheral administration of prolactin (1-3 mg/kg per day for 10 days) increases food intake and weight gain, and because ICV administration (0.5-2 /zg for l0 days) increases food intake in adult female rats (20) . However, lesions in the lateral midbrain, including the peripeduncular nuclei, which block the suckling-activated oxytocin release and milk ejection, are followed by a 50% reduction of food intake and a loss of weight (12) in lactating rats. Furthermore, oxytocin in a dose of 10-20 /xg given ICV to lactating estrogenprimed ewes increases food intake (14) . Taken together these data would imply a role for oxytocin in lactation-induced hyperphagia.",

Two substrains of Sprague-Dawley rats, defined by differences in spontaneous growth rate (designated as substrain A and B) (see Table 1 ) were used in this study. Daily weight gain and food intake Were calculated. The female rats used in this study were prepubertal and the absence of estrous cycles was confirmed by weekly examinations of vaginal smears. Female rats of substrain A gained 1.9 + 2.5 g per day and male rats 6.9 + 1.3 g per day, whereas female rats of substrain B had gained 5.1 + 1.5 g per day and males 7.7 + 4.3 g per day ( Table 1 ). The two substrains of rats also have different endocrine profiles, including higher endogenous plasma levels of oxytocin, CCK, and insulin, and significantly lower level of somatostatin in substrain B than in substrain A (Uvn~is-Moberg, in press)\u2022 There was also a marked difference between these two substrains as regards acquisition of a conditioned avoidance response. Thus, the animals of substrain B were unable to acquire the avoidance behaviour within 3 days of training, during which time substrain A displayed 90-100% of performance (Salmi et al., unpublished observations).",

Three days of ICV oxytocin administration caused an even greater difference and more sustained enhancement of daily weight gain in comparison to saline treatment. The effect seemed to be dose-related in the dose interval from 1-10 /xg. When oxytocin or saline was applied after 24 h of food deprivation, there was no further decrease in weight after ICV injection but oxytocin-treated rats increased their daily weight gain significantly more and had consumed more food 72 h after injection. In rats treated with systemic injections of the amounts of oxytocin that have effect when administered ICV, no effects on daily weight gain or food intake were observed, which suggests that the effects of oxytocin are exerted centrally.",

            "text": "The mechanisms behind the effect of oxytocin on daily weight gain are not known. One possibility would be oxytocin-induced water retention. Oxytocin has complex effects on fluid balance; most often it funtions as a diuretic. Thus, oxytocin increases sodium excretion and urine flow by a direct effect in the kidney (13) . Intrathecal administration of oxytocin has dose-dependent effects on diuresis--30 ng having a stimulatory and 300 ng an inhibitory effect (25) . Nevertheless, it is not likely that the effect of oxytocin on daily weight gain is mediated by a change in diuresis, because the effect tended to be long lasting. Furthermore, in a parallel study performed on the same substrain of rats, water intake was found to be unaffected following SC injections of oxytocin (1 mg/kg), although these treatments caused a similar long-lasting effect on weight gain (Uvn~s-Moberg, in press) Another simple explanation would be that the weight differences are a direct consequence of the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. The long-lasting effects on daily weight gain speak against this simplistic explanation. It is more likely that the differences seen between daily weight gain in oxytocinand saline-treated animals are related to the actual body weight of the animals, and are a consequence of the different amounts of food eaten by the two groups. It is also possible that the oxytocin injections have influenced the metabolism in such a way that anabolic metabolism is supported. Indeed, in the experiments mentioned above in which oxytocin was given SC and shown to cause weight gain, no increase in food intake was seen, showing that oxytocin can cause increased weight gain also in the absence of an increased food intake (Uvn~is-Moberg, in press).",

An inhibitory role for serotonin is suggested (5), but 5-HT~A agonists increase food intake (9) . Dopamine enhances feeding when injected into the lateral hypothalamus (11) , but the role of dopamine in feeding behaviour is complicated. Oxytocin could interact with these systems to influence food intake, because exogenous administration of oxytocin is shown to influence central levels of noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin (24) . Many neuropeptides are suggested to have a stimulatory effect on food intake, including dynorphin, neuropeptide Y, and galanin [for a review see Morley (19) ]. Depression of the levels of cholecystokinin (CCK)--a peptide that inhibits food intake--is suggested to contribute to the lactational hyperphagia in the rat (17) . Oxytocin may therefore interact with these peptides to influence food intake during lactation.",

There are contradictory results concerning the effect of oxytocin on prolactin. Systemic injections of high doses of oxytocin induce an increase in levels of prolactin in male rats (18) . ICV injections of 0.1 /xg of oxytocin reduce prolactin levels in rats (18) . Prolactin is shown to exert a feedback effect in the hypothalamus, increasing the release of oxytocin by a mechanism that involves dopamine (27) . Prolactin has also been shown to stimulate oxytocin release in lactating rats (23) .
