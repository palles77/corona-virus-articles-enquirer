The Centre for Infectious Disease Control (CIb), part of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), is responsible for the coordination of current infectious disease control activities, in close collaboration with a large number of professionals and organizations, in case of an outbreak or an epidemic that cannot be controlled by the involved Public Health Service (PHS) alone because of the (anticipated) severity or extent of the event. There are 28 PHSs in The Netherlands, each one under municipal authority, organized in seven larg-er public health regions. To optimize collaboration, each of the seven regions has identified a public health doctor and a regional microbiologist as a liaison with the CIb; these 14 regional professionals have a part-time appointment at the CIb. The CIb also has the task of setting up an outbreak management team (OMT), consisting of fixed members and additional experts invited personally, in the case of a novel or unexpected outbreak of infectious diseases that may spread nationwide. To prepare for a potential outbreak and to support daily control activities, a response team can be formed immediately at the CIb after the first signs of an outbreak. The Health Council of The Netherlands is an independent scientific advisory body that provides the government and parliament with advice on issues concerning public health, including vaccination strategies.",

Since the 1992/1993 influenza season, in a subsample of ILI patients, centralized virology testing has been performed at the RIVM/CIb with additional data on vaccination and selected comorbidity available. To strengthen this, efforts were made to increase the number of participating GPs, to increase the amount of sampling, and to develop a more systematic approach to sampling and data collection. To enable surveillance of more severe outcomes, GPs monitoring ILI were also asked to monitor pneumonia. Furthermore, a sentinel nursing home network was started in 2006, which included influenza/ILI and pneumonia surveillance, similar to the GP sentinel surveillance [8] .",

Together they ensure continuous online weekly updates of the influenza situation and weekly newsletters are provided during influenza epidemics. At Erasmus Medical Center, viruses from the sentinel surveillance and from selected hospitalized patients are subtyped on a routine basis. In the preparation for a potential emergence of antiviral resistant virus variants, if (stockpiled) antivirals would be widely used, the NIC developed assays to detect such variants [9, 10] . Using these assays, the NIC and other dedicated laboratories were able to characterize the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) influenza viruses during the 2007/2008 season and during the pandemic [11, 12] . Finally, as part of a routine pathogen surveillance program, a number of medical microbiology laboratories throughout the country report the weekly number of positive laboratory results for influenza virus and other respiratory viruses.",

So unless a pandemic started in The Netherlands, whereby an attempt at containment could be made [18] , control efforts should be focused on mitigating the impact on society at large and the health sector in particular, and on protecting those at risk for severe outcomes. Modeling studies had shown that therapeutic use of antivirals could reduce transmission, while also reducing the risks for those infected [2, 19, 20] , thus the Ministry of Health had purchased 5 million courses of oseltamivir in bulk in 2006, which was all repacked in individual sachets. This should cover the 30% of the population estimated to develop a symptomatic infection during a pandemic. Furthermore, the ministry started negotiations with vaccine producers to ensure rapid delivery of 34 million doses of the pandemic vaccine once available; two doses for every Dutch citizen, based on the assumption that two doses would be needed to achieve sufficient protection against a novel influenza virus.",

Multidisciplinary guidelines had been drafted to control transmission and limit adverse outcomes for both a phase of early incidental introduction and for a phase with widespread transmission. The Ministry of Health had ensured a supply and distribution schedule for antivirals and negotiated a contract for vaccine purchases. During the pandemic, existing surveillance was expanded, the established infectious disease response structure was activated, and the previously prepared protocols for communication, diagnostics, use of antivirals, and vaccination implementation were operationalized and implemented.",

Overall, the impact of the pandemic was comparable to the impact of an average seasonal influenza epidemic, but with a shift in (severe) outcomes from the very young and elderly toward young adults. Established prepared protocols enabled timely coordinated responses. In preparing for the worst, sufficient attention must be given to preparing for a mild scenario as well. ",

Confirmed cases and contacts were offered antivirals (oseltamivir) and patients were requested to stay at home for 10 days from the start of onset. Detailed household studies provided important data on transmission parameters such as R 0 and generation intervals, which were used to update existing transmission models already developed to guide and support control [24] . Cases and their contacts were furthermore requested to participate in the prepared influenza research protocol. With the increase in individual cases and with the accumulating data that the pandemic virus generally caused mild disease, comparable to seasonal influenza, support for this delay policy through social distancing and reduction of transmission declined.

Transmission and clinical impact remained at low levels until over a month after reopening of the schools; there had been no spring or summer wave in The Netherlands. Due to the cessation of the notification, and the inability to track the epidemic progression in the regular GP surveillance owing to its low intensity, the number of reported hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths was the most informative real-time data source, recognizing that this created a bias toward monitoring severe outcomes. To adjust for delay in notifications, modeling experience was used to enable nowcasting of the epidemic [28] . Temporary school closure as a method to delay and reduce the peak incidence had been a control option considered in the preparation for an epidemic phase [29, 30] . The general mild character of the pandemic versus the potentially considerable societal and economic fall-out of temporary school closures made this strategy no longer proportional. Although some individual schools did close (in part or in full) when faced with a large degree of flu absenteeism, overall this remained a rare event.",

When over the summer of 2009 more and more data became available that in general the infection did not lead to severe outcome, the Health Council advised in August that for pandemic vaccination the same risk groups as for seasonal vaccination should be targeted (i.e., people with underlying conditions, people 60 years of age and above, and healthcare professionals) with the addition of pregnant women, as these were the groups considered at highest risk of severe adverse outcomes. Thereby, vaccination was primarily intended to reduce severe morbidity and mortality, not to interrupt transmission. Although data on the effectiveness of a single dose of vaccination in healthy adults became available, the Health Council advised to maintain a two-dose schedule, as they considered there were insufficient data available to assess effectiveness for the risk groups targeted in The Netherlands (not healthy adults), and no shortage was foreseen.",

Overall, seasonal influenza vaccination uptake for medical risk groups below the age of 65 years is around 70% and for the elderly over 80% [6] . Monitoring of uptake in these groups was as always done via GP registers. Vaccination of healthcare professionals is organized by the health sector. Seasonal uptake in this group is hard to assess, but in general estimated to be around 20% for nursing home staff [38] and over 50% for GPs [39] . Vaccination uptake in pregnant women, a new target group, was hardest to assess, as no routine structure was available. Therefore, this was assessed via retrospective questionnaires among pregnant women [40] .",

Das Ministerium hatte einen Versorgungs- und Verteilungsplan f\u00fcr antivirale Substanzen erstellt und \u00fcber einen Vertrag zum Kauf von Impfstoffen verhandelt. W\u00e4hrend der Pandemie wurde die bestehende \u00dcberwachung ausgeweitet, das etablierte Reaktionsverfahren f\u00fcr Infektionskrankheiten aktiviert und die zuvor erstellten Protokolle f\u00fcr Kommunikation, Diagnostik, Einsatz antiviraler Substanzen und Impfd urchf\u00fchrung wurden ein- und umgesetzt. Als sich herausstellte, dass die Pandemie nicht so schwer wie bef\u00fcrchtet war, wurden die Risikokommunikation sowie die schnelle Modifizierung der Leitlinien und ihre Kommunikation zur wesentlichen Herausforderung. Antivirale Substanzen und Pandemieimpfstoffe waren nur f\u00fcr Personen reserviert, bei denen ein hohes Risiko f\u00fcr eine schwere Erkrankung bestand. Insgesamt wa ren die Auswirkungen der Pandemie vergleich bar mit denen einer durchschnittlichen saisonalen Influenzaepidemie, allerdings mit einer Verlagerung von (schweren) Erkrankungen von den ganz Jungen und \u00c4lteren zu jungen Erwachsenen. Etablierte vorbereitete Protokolle erm\u00f6glichten zeitlich koordinierte Reaktionen. Bei der Vorbereitung auf das Schlimmste muss auch der Einstellung auf ein weniger dramatisches Szenario ausreichende Aufmerksamkeit ge schenkt werden.",

Mit Hilfe eines neuen Computermodells k\u00f6nnten jene Personen identifiziert werden, welche eine Infektion am st\u00e4rksten verbreiten. Dies ist vor allem dann wichtig, wenn Impfstoff knapp ist. Wer eine Infektion am aktivsten \u00fcbertr\u00e4gt, ist oft schwierig vorherzusagen. Eine neue Computersimulation zeigt nun, dass nicht immer eine starke Vernetzung entscheidend ist. Auch Personen, die wenig Kontakte haben, k\u00f6nnen zur Verbreitung einer Infektion beitragen. Das Verfahren berechnet, wie viele Personen sich durch einen erstinfizierten Patienten 0 nach einer gewissen Zeit angesteckt haben. Dabei werden Wege \u00fcber bereits infizierte Personen au\u00dfer Acht gelassen, da diese bereits immun sind. Je gr\u00f6\u00dfer die Zahl der m\u00f6glichen Wege, desto gr\u00f6\u00dfer ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass ein weiterer Patient X infiziert wird. Die Zeit in der sich eine Epidemie ausbreitet entspricht dabei den Personen, die zwischen Patient 0 und Patienten x liegen. Dies wird f\u00fcr alle Personen des Netzwerkes berechnet und liefert so erstmals absolute Zahlen zum Verlauf von Epidemien. Als Modellsystem w\u00e4hlten die Forscher das virtuelle Netzwerk einer Forschergemeinschaft. Die Daten lieferten Archive wissenschaftlicher Publikationen. Gemeinsame Autorenschaft steht dabei stellvertretend f\u00fcr direkten pers\u00f6nlichen Kontakt. Die neue Computersimulation ist nicht nur 2000 Mal schneller und genauer als bisherige Methoden. Sie liefert auch erstmals wichtige Informationen \u00fcber die Bedeutung von Netzwerk-Strukturen, z.B. kleinere Cluster wie D\u00f6rfer.
