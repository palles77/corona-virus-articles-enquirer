            "text": "From the analysis of the variables and clinical responses ( Table 1) it is noteworthy that the use of metronidazole as a treatment in early or subsequent recurrences has been effective in our series of patients. Current recommendations are that initial or early recurrences are treated with oral vancomycin 125 mg/6 h for 10 days (B-I). Of the 20 patients studied, three of them were not admitted and two of them were treated at first recurrence with oral vancomycin and later with intravenous metronidazole, obtaining a complete response. In any case, the purpose of this communication and its main interest lies in cancer patients' good response to metronidazole, and in that the clinical variables evaluated, as in other studies, reflect the association between prior antibiotic treatment, use of proton-pump inhibitor and CDI. The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was first described in 2001 in respiratory secretions, although previous serological studies showed that it was already circulating in humans since 1950. 1, 2 The hMPV is responsible for acute respiratory infections (ARI) and presents a worldwide seasonal distribution, predominating in the winter. It mainly affects children under 5 years of age, making it the second viral cause after the RSV. 1, 2 ARI caused by hMPV in adults is a rare entity with a 3-10% incidence. This value is similar to that described for RSV (5%) and lower than influenza viruses (2%) during the winter season. 1,2 Although most ARI caused by hMPV in adults are asymptomatic or with few clinical manifestations, they may have high morbidity and mortality (about 10%) in nursing homes and among the elderly in general. 1, 2 We report a prospective study on ARI caused by hMPV in adults (>15 years of age) during the period between January 2014 and March 2016. A throat swab was taken from each patient who came to the emergency room with suspected ARI to detect the presence of respiratory viruses. The diagnostic technique used was a commercial PCR-type genomic amplification in real time (Allplex TM Respiratory Panel; Seegene, Seoul, South Korea). Medical records and epidemiological data of patients with hMPV in their respiratory sample were reviewed.",
