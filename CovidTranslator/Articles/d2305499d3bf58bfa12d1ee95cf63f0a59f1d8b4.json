The relative importance of latent load increases with the ventilation rates to buildings. Higher ventilation rates are dictated both by better comfort requirements and by the most recent standards such as the ASHRAE 62/99 [1] .",

According to this concept, the latent load of a room is treated by an independent humidity control system, while the sensible load is treated with some other alternative cooling techniques such as chilled-ceiling panels. Since the circulating air is dramatically reduced, energy consumption can be reduced substantially. Another benefit is that chilled water or suction temperatures can be raised, resulting in increased equipment efficiency and decreased operating costs. It is estimated that 30% of the energy used www.elsevier.com/locate/enbuild Energy and Buildings 37 (2005) 279-286 could be saved with chilled-ceiling panels combined with independent humidity control system, in comparison to a traditional coupled system [5, 6] . Nevertheless, due to the hot and humid climates in south China, energy for moisture control with an independent humidity control system still accounts for 25% of the total energy for air conditioning. Thus, energy recovery measures must be combined to an independent humidity control system.",

In this system, a membrane based total heat exchanger is used to pre-cool the fresh air before it is pumped to a refrigeration system for air dehumidification. The total heat exchanger has a membrane core where the incoming fresh air exchanges moisture and temperature simultaneously with the exhaust air. In this manner, the total heat or enthalpy from the exhaust is recovered, and both the temperature and the humidity of the fresh air are decreased, which results in energy saving. Then the cooled and dehumidified fresh air is flowed through the condenser of the refrigeration system, to satisfy the requirements of supply air: 7 g/kg humidity and 20 8C in temperature. This system is relatively simple, since the membrane system has no moving parts, and is compact. Desiccant wheels may be another choice, however, in some circumstances, gas or other thermal heat may be difficult to find. The control of the new system is easier than a conventional compression dehumidification system, because no other components except a membrane system is added to the system. The differences are the operating parameters are changed, and much fan power is needed. The membrane system operated in near atmospheric pressure condition, the maintenance is easy.",

In other words, the distributed parameter models in such studies are strongly based on design parameters of a specific refrigeration system. Those detailed models just gave very generalized equations for the calculation of heat and mass transport in each component and rely heavily on manufacturers' product empirical data. Further, this study gives a general view of energy savings in sub-tropical regions, which do not rely on a specific system. Furthermoreover, the more detailed partial difference models in other studies are difficult and slow in finding a solution. It is difficult to use such models in a wholeyear-hour-by-hour simulation. Those more complicated models are usually necessary to study transient responses and start-up characters of a refrigeration cycle, which is beyond the scope of this study.",

            "text": "The effects of the refrigeration cycle on the whole system are demonstrable. A thermodynamic model of the refrigeration system is formulated based on the processes of refrigerant R134a shown in Fig. 3 . Saturated R134a liquid at point 4 flows through an expansion valve and becomes wet vapor at point 5. Refrigerant at this state flows to the evaporator (also the dehumidifier) where it chills and dehumidifies the fresh air and evaporates to point 6 and further superheats to point 1. Then the refrigerant vapor is pumped by a compressor to point 2 where the vapor is displaced to the condenser and condensates from state 2 to 4 through 3. The superheat is set to 5 8C. It should be noted that the exact degree of superheating may be affected by many factors, such as evaporator, expansion valve, and compressor, and are strongly related to operating conditions, control strategies. Experiments found superheating are in the range of 2-16 8C; and the superheating increases with air tempera- ture in the evaporator, from 3 to 14 8C when the expansion valve is fully open. From viewpoint of energy use, too large superheating is not good. Generally, 3-14 8C superheating are possible. Refrigerant superheating refers to the superheating in the evaporator. Superheating from tubes can be neglected with well tube-insulating, since superheating from such sources is harmful to energy performance and should be prevented. The effects of heating in the compressor are included in the compressor's isentropic efficiency.",

Usually, they are divided into regions associated to the phase of the refrigerant. Each region constitutes a separate heat exchanger. In the case of the condenser, the superheated vapor, the condensation and subcooled liquid regions are considered, whereas for the evaporator it is divided into the evaporating and superheated vapor regions. For each region, the refrigerant side and air side convective heat transfer coefficients need be calculated from the established correlations for single-phase and two-phase flow. For the evaporator, when the average fin surface temperature is calculated to be less than the local water dew point of the air stream, moisture condensation will occur. Under these conditions, the air heat transfer coefficients can no longer be calculated as in dry conditions, and a water mass balance must be carried out. In this case, the enthalpic method, proposed by Threlkeld [9] and introduced in ASHRAE Handbook [10] was most adequate for use. According to this procedure, the driving force for heat transfer is assumed to be the difference between the saturated enthalpy of the air flowing over the fins and a fictitious saturated air enthalpy evaluated at the refrigerant temperature.",

Some membranes such as polyethersulphone, cellulose triacetate, and polyvinylchloride, are useful in separating moisture from the vapor/air mixture, due to their strong affinity to the water molecule. The strong affinity also leads to the high permeation difference between water and air. The permeability ratio of water to air ranges from 460 to 30,000. In other words, gases other than vapor can hardly permeate through the membrane. These features have led to the development of a novel ventilator, the so-called membrane based enthalpy exchanger in which both the sensible heat and the moisture are transferred simultaneously through the membrane. Since the membranes are very thin, both the heat and the moisture transfer rates can be very high. Furthermore, no water condensation happens in the membrane system, which prevents hygienic problems of microorganism growth that is common for cooling coils.",
