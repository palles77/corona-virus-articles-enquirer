The GP73 cDNA was cloned by differential screening of a cDNA library derived from the liver of a patient with adult giant-cell hepatitis (GCH ), a rare form of hepatitis with presumed viral etiology. In vitro transcription-translation studies indicate that GP73 is an integral membrane protein, and immunolocalization experiments using epitope-tagged GP73 demonstrate that the protein is localized to the Golgi apparatus. Northern blot analysis of RNA from multiple human tissues reveals a single GP73 mRNA transcript with a size of approximately 3.0 kb. Immunohistochemical studies using rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against recombinant GP73 demonstrate that the protein is preferentially expressed by epithelial cells in many human tissues. In normal livers, GP73 is consistently present in biliary epithelial cells, whereas hepatocytes show little or no signal. In contrast, livers of patients with GCH display strong GP73 immunoreactivity in multinucleated hepatocytes. GP73 mRNA and protein are expressed in highly differentiated HepG2 hepatoma cells after infection with adenovirus in vitro. We conclude that GP73 represents a novel, epithelial cell-specific integral membrane Golgi protein that can be upregulated in response to viral infection.",

However, the striking variability of its mRNA and protein levels in normal human tissues suggests the presence of regulatory controls and, possibly, multiple functions. In support of a cell-specific role of GP73, we found that the protein was preferentially expressed in cells of the epithelial lineage, including colonic, bronchial, renal, prostate, and hepatic biliary epithelial cells. Our data raise a number of questions regarding the etiology of GCH. Based on indirect morphological and serological evidence, a paramyxoviral infection has been zation with the Golgi marker protein giantin (Linstedt and Hauri, 1993) . In view of the known distribution of implicated as the etiological agent in many cases of the disease (Phillips et al., 1991 , Fimmel et al., 1998 , but giantin in the cis-and medial-Golgi cisternae, we postulate that GP73 is contained in the same subcompart-no specific viral agent has been identified to date. Many of the morphological alterations of human GCH are ments. Based on our initial sequence information, we considered alternative cellular localizations of GP73. In reminiscent of the changes observed in models of murine coronavirus hepatitis. Morphologically, this infection is particular, the presence of a putative signal peptidase cleavage site adjacent to the transmembrane domain characterized by the disruption of the normal intracellular vesicle targeting process through the interaction of raised the possibility that GP73 might be a secreted protein (Nielsen et al., 1997) . However, our in vitro viral proteins with resident Golgi proteins (Lavi et al., 1996; Opstelten et al., 1996) . Interestingly, mice rendered translation data clearly demonstrate that GP73 becomes alkali-resistant upon incorporation into microsomal immunodeficient by homozygous deficiency of the transcription factor STAT1 develop syncitial GCH upon membranes, a feature that is typical for integral membrane proteins and incompatible with secreted or peri-infection with coronavirus (Durbin et al., 1996) , suggesting that the distinct phenotype of human GCH may be pheral membrane proteins. The possibility that GP73 might be targeted to the plasma membrane was also due to the combination of an impaired immunological response and a viral infection. Based on the similarities considered. However, our immunocytochemical data consistently demonstrated the absence of any plasma between human and murine GCH, we speculate that the Golgi apparatus may be an important target for the membrane staining, suggesting that GP73 is not localized to this membrane. Unlike many of the known Golgi putative viral agent in this disease. Our data provide a rationale for a search for viral proteins that might type II membrane proteins, GP73 is not predicted to have any oligosaccharide-modifying properties, and a interact with GP73 in this disease. Our in vitro data obtained in adenovirus-infected computer-based motif analysis failed to predict any specific enzymatic properties of the molecule (Paulson HepG2 cells demonstrate that the de novo expression of GP73 is a feature of the cellular response to viral and Colley, 1989) . In this regard, GP73 resembles another recently described type II Golgi protein, infection. This response may not be limited to one particular virus, since a partial GP73 cDNA was first GPP130/GIMPc (Linstedt et al., 1997) . The two proteins share several structural features, including a highly isolated based on its overexpression in an in vitro model of Newcastle virus infection (gb U25276).
