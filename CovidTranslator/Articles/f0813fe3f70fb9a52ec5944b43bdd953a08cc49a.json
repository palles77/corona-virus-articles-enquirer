            "text": "The location of autocrine interactions between the v-sis protein and PDGF receptors remains uncertain and controversial. To examine whether receptor-ligand interactions can occur intracellularly, we have constructed fusion proteins that anchor v-sis to specific intracellular membranes. Fusion of a cis-Golgi retention signal from a coronavirus E1 glycoprotein to v-sis protein completely abolished its transforming ability when transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Fusion proteins incorporating mutations in this retention signal were not retained within the Golgi complex but instead were transported to the cell surface, resulting in efficient transformation. All chimeric proteins were shown to dimerize properly. Derivatives of some of these constructs were also constructed bearing the cytoplasmic tail from the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). These constructs allowed examination of subcellular localization by double-label immunofluorescence, using antibodies that distinguish between the extraceUular PDGF-related domain and the VSV-G cytoplasmic tail. Colocalization of sis-E1-G with Golgi markers confirmed its targeting to the early Golgi complex. The sis-E1 constructs, targeted to the early Golgi complex, exhibited no proteo-lyric processing whereas the mutant forms of sis-E1 exhibited normal proteolytic processing. Treatment with suramin, a polyanionic compound that disrupts ligand/receptor interactions at the cell surface, was able to revert the transformed phenotype induced by the mutant sis-E1 constructs described here. Our results demonstrate that autocrine interactions between the v-sis oncoprotein and PDGF receptors within the early Golgi complex do not result in functional signal transduction.",

            "text": "Autocrine transformation (Sporn and Todaro, 1980) oc-curs when the same cell expresses PDGF receptors as well as the v-sis protein. In this situation, there also exists the possibility of intracellular ligand/receptor interactions within the secretory pathway (Betsholtz et al., 1986) . The secretory pathway consists of functionally distinct compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the entire Golgi apparatus, consisting of the cis-Golgi network, the cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi cisternae, as well as the trans-Golgi network (TGN) t (Macharner, 1993; Pelham, 1991) . Determination of the site of autocrine ligand/receptor interactions has distinct implications for the treatment of human cancers that exhibit autocrine activation of signal transduction pathways. If autocrine interactions only occur on the cell surface, then transformed cells should be responsive to treatment with exogenous substances that disrupt these interactions. However, if such interactions occur intracellularly, such as in the ER or the Golgi complex, then addition of such antagonism will not be sufficient to revert transformation. Thus, it is of vital importance, both from a clinical and a molecular standpoint, to understand fully the mechanism and cellular location of autocrine interactions between ligands and receptors. There exists considerable controversy over the biological significance of intracellular interactions between v-sis and the PDGF-receptor. It has been demonstrated that mitogenesis can be blocked in some sis-transformed cells by treating them with antibodies against PDGF (Huang et al., 1984) . While these results indicate that cell surface interactions between the v-sis protein and PDGF receptors are important in the transformation process, these same researchers demonstrated that some sis-transformed cells did not detectably secrete v-sis protein, and anti-PDGF antibody did not affect transformation. This implies that an intracellular mechanism of autocrine transformation may also exist. Other researchers have reported that in normal cells, PDGF only activates receptors present on the cell surface, but that in sis-transformed cells, intracellular receptors are activated and undergo autophosphorylation in an autocrine fashion (Keating and Williams, 1988; Bejcek et al., 1992) . There is also evidence that E5, the transforming protein of bovine papillomavirus, can interact with immature, intracellular forms of PDGF receptors, stimulating their autophosphorylation activity (Goldstein et al., 1992; Petti and DiMaio, 1992; Cohen et al., 1993) .",

            "text": "Indirect methods that rely upon pharmacologic agents have been used by some researchers in attempts to identify the site of ligand/receptor interactions. Monensin has been shown to block transport of proteins through the trans-Golgi portion of the secretory pathway (Tartakoff, 1983) . Treatment of v-sis-expressing cells with monensin prevents autophosphorylation of mature PDGF receptors and expression of c-fos (a nuclear protein involved in cellular growth regulation), suggesting that v-sis must be transported beyond the point of monensin's inhibitory activity (past the trans-Golgi portion) in order to activate signal transduction pathways (Hannink and Donoghue, 1988) . However, monensin exerts pleiotropic effects on cations within cells, so other cellular events may have been affected in these experiments. Suramin, a potent inhibitor of proliferation of cells expressing v-sis and PDGF receptors, seems to interfere only with ligand/receptor interactions at the cell surface, reducing the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors. Suramin has little or no effect on intracellular phosphorylated receptors (Fleming et al., 1989) . This suggests a requirement for cellsurface interactions between receptor and ligand for expres-sion of a transformed phenotype. However, the mechanism of action of surarnin is unclear, and there is evidence that it accumulates within endosomes (Hawking, 1978) . Thus, experiments utilizing agents such as monensin or suramin have been viewed as problematic by some researchers. Therefore, we have recently exploited more direct approaches to address this issue of intraceUular ligand/receptor interactions. The recent identification of specific targeting and retention signals makes it possible to localize v-sis protein to specific intracellular compartments. This potentially allows one to scan the secretory pathway for compartments that allow functional transforming interactions between v-sis and PDGF receptors. This represents a powerful approach for examining autocrine interactions, and can be applied to other autocrine growth factors or systems as well. ER-anchored forms of v-sis were previously constructed by this lab, using an adenovirus transmembrane protein E3/19K retention signal, DEKKMP (Nilsson et al., 1989) . These constructs prevented cell surface expression of v-sis protein as determined by immunofluorescence, and transformation was inhibited by retention of the fusion protein in the ER . In this report, we continued our analysis of autocrine transformation from within secretory pathway compartments by creating novel v-sis fusion proteins targeted to unique subcellular compartments. One signal that we chose was the cis-Golgi localization signal represented by the first transmembrane domain of the avian coronavirus E1 glycoprotein (El) of infectious bronchitis virus, which has been shown by others to target heterologous proteins such as VSV-G and c~m (a derivative of the human chorionic gonadotropin-c~ subunit) to the cis-Golgi complex (Swift and Machamer, 1991) . In addition, we chose to exploit the TGN-localization signal of the protein TGN38, contained within its transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail, which has been shown to retarget heterologous proteins, such as the LDL receptor and the Tac antigen, to the TGN (Bos et al., 1993; Humphrey et al., 1993) . The resulting sis fusion proteins, referred to as sis-E1 and sis-TGN38, allowed a further characterization of the site of autocrine interactions between the v-sis oncoprotein and PDGF receptors.",

The same amount of DNA was transfected for each construct, and the number of foci formed was normalized to the activity of the positive control, sis-G. As shown in Table I , cells transfected with sis-E1 or sis-E1-G exhibited negligible transforming activity, comparable to the mock-transfected cells. The presence of the VSV-G cytoplasmic tail in the sis-E1-G construct seemed to have little or no effect on its transforming activity.

The mutant derivafive, sis-TGN38A, which lacks the tyrosine-containing TGN localization signal, was consistently more active in transformarion assays, exhibiting 55 % as many foci as the sis-G control. Recently, it was demonstrated that TGN38 recycles from the TGN to the cell surface (Reaves et al., 1993) . This observation complicates our results, in that we are at this point unable to determine if the transforming potential of the sis-TGN38 fusion protein is due to a subpopulation of protein molecules present on the cell surface at any given time, or whether it is truly mediated by ligand/receptor interactions occurring within the TGN. Further experiments will be needed to clarify this.",

            "text": "To verify that the constructs used in this study were capable of encoding the desired proteins, the coding regions from each construct were swapped into a pSP64(polyA) vector (Promega Biotec, Madison, WI) for in vitro transcription and translation experiments. Messenger RNA was synthesized (Melton, 1987) and translation reactions were performed in rabbit reticulate lysate in the presence of [35S]Cys. SDS-PAGE analysis of the products of these reactions demonstrated proteins with molecular weights that correlated with the expected sizes of each of the fusion proteins (data not shown). This indicates that our constructs encode the desired fusion proteins. The results summarized in Table I indicate that sis-E1 and sis-E1-G chimeric proteins are not able to cause transformation. The most likely explanation is that these proteins are anchored in a cellular compartment where they are unable to functionally interact with PDGF receptors. However, one might postulate other explanations for the lack of transforming activity exhibited by these proteins. For example, a critical post-translational event may be altered by forcing v-sis to remain intracellular, thereby abolishing its activity. N-linked glycosylation of v-sis is not required for its biological activity (Sauer et al., 1986) , and bacteriaUy-expressed PDGF-BB (which has no N-or O-linked glycosylation) is biologically active (Hoppe et al., 1989) . Therefore, glycosylation of v-sis, although altered in these fusion proteins, does not constitute a critical processing event. However, v-sis must dimerize in order to function , so perhaps these fusion proteins do not dimerize correctly. To address this, we infected NIH3T3 cells with viral supernatants collected from cells transfected with the indicated v-sis fusion constructs (see legend to Fig. 2) . The fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated using the a-sis antibody, and one half of the sample was treated with nonreducing sample buffer to examine dimeric proteins, while the other half was treated with reducing sample buffer to examine monomeric forms. Fig. 2 , lanes 3 and 9 shows that the sis-E1 chimera indeed dimerizes, yielding a dimer band of \u202262-64 kD under nonreducing conditions, and a 32-kD monomer band un-der reducing conditions. Comparison of the left and right panels of Fig. 2 further illustrates that all of the chimeric proteins dimerize as expected, indicating that this critical processing event is not altered in the fusion proteins. Thus, these data suggest that the transforming activity of the v-sis fusion proteins described here most closely correlates with their subcellular localization within the cell, as verified further below, rather than resulting from differences in posttranslational processing events.",

On the other hand, the mutant derivatives sis-El(Ql)-G and sis-El(ins)-G both exhibited processing, which appears as a doublet of lower mo- lecular mass bands (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4, indicated by arrows). Similar results were obtained using the constructs lacking the G tail (data not shown).

The sis-TGN38 construct (F) displays decreased but detectable surface staining, indicating that a portion of the population of this protein reaches the cell surface. This is consistent with the behavior of native TGN38, which has been shown to recycle between the TGN and the cell surface (Reaves et al., 1993) . Since a small amount of this sis-q'GN38 fusion protein reaches the cell surface, this may explain the transforming activity of this construct in the focus formation assays (see Table I ). However, at this time we have no way of determining if the TGNretained population of the fusion protein contributes in any way to the transforming activity. While Fig. 4 clearly demonstrates that the sis-E1 mutants and the sis-TGN38 derivatives reach the cell surface, it does not answer the question of whether the sis-E1 or sis-E1-G fusions do not reach the surface. To address this question, double-label immunofluorescence was performed using the constructs bearing the VSV-G cytoplasmic tail. This allowed for simultaneous examination of both intracellular and cell surface populations of the various fusion proteins within the same cell. Cell surface protein was detected with an antibody against v-sis. The cells were then permeabilized, and intracellular fusion proteins were detected with a monoclonal antibody to the VSV-G protein. As positive controls, both the sis-El(ins)-G and the sis-El(Ql)-G fusion proteins were included in this assay. As in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 shows that these proteins were readily detected within the cell (E and G) as well as on the cell surface (F and H). As another control, sis-G was included. This fusion protein was created in our lab for previous experiments, and it localizes to the cell surface (Hannink and Donoghue, 1986a) . A and B of Fig. 5 clearly demonstrate both intracellular and surface staining for this construct. C demonstrates the reticular and perinuclear intracellular staining consistently seen for sis-El-G, indicating presence of this protein within the ER and Golgi complex.",

The Golgi markers used were (a) Lens culinaris lectin, a carbohydratebinding protein that binds to terminal o~-mannosyl and o~-Dglucosyl residues (Kornfeld et al., 1981) , and has been shown to stain primarily the Golgi complex of cells (Hsu et al., 1992; Machamer et al., 1993) ; and (b) a monoclonal antibody 10Et, described by Wood et al. (1991) , which was localized to the cis-Golgi complex of NRK cells by immunoelectron microscopy. In these studies, the sis-E1-G chimera was expressed in NIH3T3 cells by infection with retroviral supernatants, and was detected in fixed and permeabilized cells with a polyclonal rabbit antisera to v-sis. This in turn was visualized with a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. To visualize the Golgi complex, these same cells were treated with either a fluorescein-conjugated Lens culinaris lectin, or with the mouse mAb 10E6, which was visualized with a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The two cells shown for each condition in Fig. 6 are representative Cells expressing various fusion proteins were processed for immunofluorescence. Surface proteins were detected by a rabbit serum directed against the v-sis protein, and rhodamine-conjugated goat antirabbit antibody (B, D, F, and H). Intrac~llular proteins were detected by a mouse mAb against the COOH-terminal portion of the VSV-G protein and a biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, followed by FITC-conjugated streptavidin (A, C, E, and G). A and B , sis-G, C and D, sis-El-G; E and F, sis-El(ins) of the sis-El-G-expressing cells generated in these immunofluorescence assays. The percentage of ceils expressing protein was higher using this infection protocol than that obtained by transient transfections. This percentage varied from \u202210-15 %. As Fig. 6 shows, the sis-E1-G fusion protein clearly colocalizes with both the lectin (see A and B, C and D) and the mAb 10E6 (see E and F, G and H). Thus, the E1 cis-Golgi targeting signal functions correctly and targets v-sis to the early Golgi when incorporated into a fusion protein.",

In all cases, suramin did indeed revert the phenotype. It has been shown that E5, an oncoprotein derived from the bovine papillomavirus, can interact with immature intracellular forms of PDGF receptors, and may stimulate their autophosphorylation activity (Goldstein et al., 1992; Petti and DiMaio, 1992; Cohen et al., 1993) . It has also been shown by Xu et al. (1993) that BPV-E5-transformed cells do not revert in the presence of suramin. Thus, cells transformed by E5 were included as a negative control in the suramin reversion assay. As expected, the presence of suramin did not affect the transformed phenotype of NIH3T3 cells expressing E5 (Fig. 7 , K and L). These results indicate that the productive transforming interactions between PDGF receptors and the v-sis fusion proteins described here are occurring in a suraminsensitive site, most likely the cell surface.",

These receptors were then subjected to an in vitro kinase assay, and incorporation of labeled phosphate from [3,-32P]ATP into the receptor protein was visualized by SDS-PAGE. As seen in Fig. 8 , in the absence of stimulation with PDGF, little or no activatable receptors were detected (B, lanes 1-9). After stimulation with PDGF-BB, however, NIH3T3 cells, mock-transfected cells, and cells expressing sis-E1 all exhibited a significant level of cell surface activatable receptors (A, 1-3), as demonstrated by the phosphorylation of PDGF-# receptors of ~180 kD. Expression of the mutant sis-El(Ql) and sis-El(ins) constructs, which reach the cell surface, led to downregulation of cell surface activatable receptors, and thus there was little detectable kinase activity in these samples (Fig. 8A, lanes 4  and 5) . Similar results were obtained with sis-TGN38, sis-TGN38A and v-sis, which also reach the cell surface ( Fig.  8/1, lanes 6, 7, and 8) . These results demonstrate that when v-sis is forced to remain in an intracellular compartment, such as the early Golgi, it is unable to downregulate cell surface PDGF receptors.

All fusion proteins constructed for these experiments dimerized properly, indicating that this critical post-translational modification of the v-sis portion of the fusions was not altered. The fusion proteins sis-E1 and sis-E1-G were efficiently retained intracellularly, as evidenced by the lack of proteolytic processing of the constructs and lack of downregulated cell surface PDGF receptors. Immunofluorescence data are consistent with Golgi localization of the sis-E1 and sis-E1-G constructs. Colocalization with Lens culinaris lectin and mAb 10E6 confirm targeting to the early Golgi complex of the sis-E1 and sis-E1-G constructs. Mutant derivatives of the these constructs, containing defects in the cis-Golgi localization signal, were not retained inside the cell and were transforming. These proteins were proteolytically processed as expected, and were detectable on the cell surface by immunofluorescence. Suramin reverted the transformation induced by these latter constructs, providing further evidence that functional interactions between v-sis and PDGF receptors occur primarily on the cell surface. The results obtained with the sis-E1 and sis-E1-G constructs indicate that the intracellular compartment of the early Golgi complex does not allow for autocrine activation of PDGF receptors.",

Indeed, it has been demonstrated recently that TGN38 actually recycles from the cell surface and back to the TGN (Reaves et al., 1993) . It is likely that this population of molecules that reached the cell surface was responsible for the transformation seen in the focus assays in cells expressing this fusion protein, since treatment with suramin reverted the transformed phenotype. However, we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that functional autocrine interactions can occur in the TGN. Significantly, however, when the COOHterminus of the TGN38-derived domain was truncated, the transforming efficiency of the derivative sis-TGN38A nearly doubled (Table I) .

Keating and Williams (1988) reported the detection of PDGF receptors that are activated intracellularly in v-sis-transformed cells. These receptors were of an immature form, as determined by their molecular mass (160 kD) and lack of glycosylation (Huang and Huang, 1988; Keating and Williams, 1988) , and are rapidly degraded after stimulation by v-sis (Keating and Williams, 1988; Bejcek et al., 1992) . High concentrations of antisera to PDGF were shown to be unable to reverse transformation of NRK cells. Also, high levels of exogenously added v-sis protein have not been shown to cause transformation of NRK cells (Bejcek et al., 1989) . Both of these observations suggest that an intracellular autocrine mechanism may exist. These same researchers attached a six-amino acid ER-retention signal, SEKDEL, to the v-sis protein and observed morphological transformation of cells expressing this fusion protein. No secreted fusion protein was detectable. Bejcek and coworkers (1992) also have shown that v-sis, but not endogenously expressed PDGF-A homodimers, can activate PDGF receptors intracellularly; thus the capacity of v-sis to act intracellularly may underlie its mechanism of transformation.",

Thus, the finding that v-sis can transform cells with this KDEL signal attached most likely indicates that an undetectable amount of the fusion protein was able to escape the ER to a more distal location, such as the cell surface, where productive autocrine interactions occurred.

One reason that the sis-G-ER \u00f7 construct could not productively interact with PDGF-R could be that either the ligand or the receptors had not yet undergone critical posttranslational modifications required for functional interactions and signal transduction. Such modifications may occur in the Golgi portion of the secretory pathway, particularly modifications of N-linked oligosaccharide or the addition of O-linked oligosaccharide which are largely confined to the later Golgi compartments. We have previously demonstrated that, except for disulfide bond formation which occurs in the ER very shortly after translation, further posttranslational modifications are not required for the biological activity of the v-sis protein Hannink and Donoghue, 1986b; Sauer and Donoghue, 1988) . However, extensive oligosaccharide addition and modification to PDGF-R occurs, and its importance is not clear (Keating and Williams, 1987) . Use of an early Golgi retention signal-the first transmembrane domain of the E1 glycoprotein-allowed us to begin to investigate possible autocrine interactions within the Golgi region by retaining v-sis as a fusion protein in this compartment. This retention of the v-sis oncoprotein within the early Golgi complex completely abrogated its transforming ability, and thus we conclude that productive autocrine interactions cannot occur in the early secretory pathway.",

However, immunofluorescence data indicate that a small portion of this sis-TGN38 fusion protein was able to reach the cell surface, a finding that is consistent with reports by Reaves et al. (1993) that TGN38 recycles be: tween the TGN and the cell surface. Suramin treatment of cells expressing sis-TGN38 leads to reversion of the transformed phenotype, further implicating a cell surface pool of sis-TGN38 in the transformation of these cells. However, we are unable to conclusively determine from these experiments that v-sis targeted to the TGN is not transforming. Currently, we are undertaking studies which should further clarify interactions within the late Golgi compartments. These new studies utilize a similar approach of constructing fusion proteins, this time using the transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic tails of well-characterized glycosyltransferases, which are resident Golgi enzymes. These membrane anchors should give tighter retention in the later Golgi compartments than seen with the TGN38-derived retention signal, and will hopefully provide a conclusive indication of whether v-sis is able to engage in productive autocrine interactions within the late Golgi complex.",

            "text": "While it has been established that immature forms of the PDGF-R can be stimulated by v-sis to undergo phosphorylation within the secretory pathway (Hannink and Donoghue, 1988; Keating and Williams, 1988; Bejcek et al., 1992) , the question remains-are these interactions functional? That is, does this simple intracellular interaction between v-sis and PDGF-R contribute to acquisition of the transformed phenotype? One argument against this possibility is that the downstream effector molecules, such as PLC-3, (Kumjian et al., 1989; Meisenhelder et ai., 1989; Wahl et al., 1989; Morrison et al., 1990) , PI-3 kinase (Coughlin et ai., 1989; Kazlauskas and Cooper, 1989) , ras-GAP Kazlauskas et al., 1990) , and others, that normally interact with activated PDGF-R at the plasma membrane may not be available to the immature activated receptors present within the secretory pathway. The evidence from Bejcek et al. (1992) that indicates the intracellularly phosphorylated, immature forms of the receptor are capable of interacting with PI-3 kinase in 3T3 cells begins to address the functionality of intracellular v-sis/PDGF receptor interactions, but far from answers the question. Future studies in our lab will be aimed at examining the availability of such effector molecules within the secretory pathway, and whether they can indeed be activated intracellularly. These studies will include attempts to retarget some members of the signal transduction machinery to the early Golgi complex, to see if this will then allow sis-E1 or sis-E1-G to signal from this compartment. The results of these future studies should provide significant insight into the mechanisms of autocrine transformation.",
