Candice Byers (The Jackson Laboratory, USA) presented her work dissecting the genetic architecture of stem cell differentiation using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) derived from 33 BXD lines. Byers maintained these cells in ground state pluripotency conditions and identified QTLs for chromatin accessibility (caQTLs) and gene expression (eQTLs). Several trans-QTLs were identified for both genomic traits, implicating a common regulatory system for chromatin state and gene expression. These shared QTLs were enriched for KRAB zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs), which are known to regulate expression of transposable elements (TEs). Byers showed that TEs were often differentially expressed between the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J founders and that the regulation of TE expression is controlled by caQTLs implicated in this work. Her findings raise the intriguing possibility that TE and KRAB-ZFPs are engaged in an evolutionary conflict over the control of gene expression networks in mESCs during differentiation. Joseph Palmer (University of Alabama-Birmingham, USA) identified genomic signatures associated with stem cell quiescence using a melanocyte stem cell model. Employing RNA sequencing from stem cells at three different ages, he was able to identify core regulatory networks associated with both quiescence and activation. Interestingly, he also identified a subtype of deep quiescent cells that remain quiescent in advancing age. Genes that are differentially expressed between cells at different levels of quiescence provide intriguing candidates to pursue as key determinants of maintenance of proper stem cell function in aging cells.",

Marisa Brake (Oakland University, USA) presented an extensive dissection of an ENU screen for dominant suppressors of VTE in the F5 tm2Dgi /F5 tm2Dgi Tfpi tm1Gjb /+ mouse line, which yields perinatal lethality. Linkage analysis implicated F3 as a potential candidate in one thrombosuppressor line, though no coding mutations could be recovered. Brake then performed whole-genome sequencing on five mice from one thrombosuppressor line and identified 23 non-coding variants within the linkage peak. Amy Siebert (Oakland University) presented work from alternate thrombosuppressor lines resulting from the same ENU screen. In these lines, a R258G missense mutation in the Actr2 gene was revealed as a candidate modifier of lethality. These observations led Siebert to use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to create knockout alleles of the Actr2 mutation. Surprisingly, offspring carrying the knockout or missense allele could not be obtained, confirming that both Actr2 alleles are required for survival.",

            "text": "Two trainee talks focused on \"dark matter\" regions of the mammalian genome that continue to elude full characterization on account of their repetitive architecture: centromeres and transposable elements (TEs). Centromeres are essential for genome stability and cellular mechanics, but paradoxically, are rapidly evolving at the sequence level. In order to better understand the diversity and evolution of these genomic regions, Uma Arora (The Jackson Laboratory) introduced a pipeline to query k-mer frequencies from unmapped sequencing reads in diverse mouse strain genomes. Her preliminary findings uncovered significant variation in the frequency of k-mers that comprise the consensus centromere satellite sequence, suggesting remarkable diversity in copy number at these critical genomic loci. TE insertion is an important source of phenotypic variability and genomic instability, yet little is known about the distribution or functional impact of TEs in diverse genetic contexts. Anwica Kashfeen (UNC-Chapel Hill, USA) presented the ELITE algorithm for high-throughput identification of TEs across multiple mouse populations. This method has high sensitivity and remarkable accuracy, underscoring its promise for the discovery and functional validation of TE insertions across current and future genomic resources for genetically diverse mice. Two trainee talks underscored the power of mouse models for toxicology research and drug testing. Lauren Lewis (Texas A&M University, USA) exposed 50 recombinant inbred Collaborative Cross (CC) strains to 1,3-butadiene (BD), a known human carcinogen, to address whether the genotoxic effects of exposure were heritable. THB-Gua adduct levels and several histone modifications showed strain-specific responses to BD. Furthermore, she observed an inverse relationship between the level of THB-Gua adducts after exposure and H3K27ac/H327me3 ratio prior to exposure, demonstrating that the pre-exposure epigenetic landscape may influence the genotoxicity of BD in certain CC strains. Yuna Son (Florida State University, USA) evaluated the importance of epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and posttranslational histone modifications in differential responses to steroid treatment of keloid lesions. Her ongoing work aims to test the hypothesis that genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity alter the diverse response to wound healing and steroid treatment for keloids in humans.",

Sam Widmayer (North Carolina State University, USA) presented his work using a panel of hybrid male mice that carried identical genotypes at these known HMS loci in order to uncover genetic background effects on HMS phenotypes. He showed that, not only did fertility vary across the panel, but that some genetic backgrounds exhibited age-dependent fertility. His findings demonstrate the existence of segregating modifiers of HMS among inbred mouse strains, hinting at under-appreciated levels of genetic complexity in HMS.",

Sarah Leist (UNC-Chapel Hill) used similar mapping techniques in her studies identifying determinants of genetic susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Her QTL analyses yielded multiple candidate genes common to the TLR4 pathway, highlighting the importance of innate immunity in the host response to some viral pathogens.

Using mediation analysis of hundreds of QTLs, he identified six causal regulators of ground state pluripotency. In a series of elegant allele swap experiments, he showed that a single variant within the Lifr gene drives variation in the expression of 202 genes and influences the ease of ESC derivation in DO founder strains. Jesse Raab (UNC-Chapel Hill) presented novel results expanding our knowledge of genetic drivers of cell fate.

Tillotson studies MECP2, which binds symmetrically methylated DNA (5-mCG) as well as asymmetrically methylated DNA (5-mCAC) through its methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD). MECP2 mutations are responsible for over 95% of Rett Syndrome cases. Tillotson showed that MECP2's MBD is not functionally replaceable by the MBD of its family member MBD2, which can only bind 5-mCG. She found that mice with modified MECP2 containing MBD2's DNA binding domain have Rett-Syndrome-like characteristics. Interestingly, not all phenotypes recapitulate classical Rett Syndrome in the mouse, suggesting MECP2's 5-mCAC binding has unique functional properties in the context of this disease. Pospisilik presented his work on the role of chromatin regulators in susceptibility to complex diseases such as obesity and diabetes. He focused on the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) epigenetic complex and demonstrated an important role in islet beta-cell identity.

Pardo-Manuel de Villena used ELITE (see Anwica Kashfeen in Trainee Session) to scan three largely independent mouse populations for TE insertions and characterize the distribution and functional consequences of over 19,500 TE insertion sites among inbred strains. TE insertion rates varied tremendously among inbred mouse strains, hinting at the presence of segregating genetic modifiers of the TE mutation rate. Over 2700 TE insertion sites were common to multiple strains, suggesting that many TE insertions are effectively neutral. However, Pardo-Manuel de Villena also identified ~ 400 TE insertions that are predicted to be deleterious. These variants may represent an important source of phenotypic variation in studies of complex traits in the mouse. Churchill used whole genome sequences from a pedigreed C57BL6/J mouse family to address the extent of genetic drift in commonly used inbred mouse strains.

Three talks focused on the multifaceted roles of this intriguing gene. Vaclav Gergelits (Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Republic) summarized his comprehensive analysis of non-crossover (NCO) gene conversion events in whole genome sequences from PWD/PhJ chromosome substitution strains (CSSs) on the B6 background and progenitors, where NCO events are highly enriched. He found that B6 and PWD PRDM9 binding sites were often observed within 250 bases of NCO gene conversion events. Gene conversion events also overlapped with previously reported H3K4me3 modifications and DMC1 binding sites, providing additional evidence for evolutionary erosion of PRDM9 binding sites through NCO gene conversion. Chris Baker (The Jackson Laboratory) addressed the role of PRDM9 as a pioneer factor in male germ cells, specifying recombination hotspots by making chromatin accessible to other epigenetic modifiers. Baker identified one such candidate modifier that directly interacts with PRDM9 during the specification and repair of future double-strand break sites. Engineered mice lacking this enzyme recapitulate the loss of meiotic germ cells shown by Prdm9 knockout mice, demonstrating that this interacting partner of PRDM9 is essential for proper recombination hotspot activation. Tanmoy Bhattacharyya (The Jackson Laboratory) provided an overview of an intriguing potential role of a burst of TE insertions in modulating hybrid male sterility (HMS) between the PWD and B6 strains. Though the genetic interaction of Prdm9 and Chromosome (Chr) X in driving HMS is well characterized, Bhattacharyya presented work elucidating the mechanism of this interaction. B6 consomic mice hemizygous for Prdm9 and containing only a 50 Mb fragment of the PWD Chr X phenocopied sterile (PWDxB6)F1 hybrids and displayed reduced recombination hotspot activation traditionally indicative of PRDM9 activity. Bhattacharyya also showed that the L1md transposon is enriched on the PWD Chr X and bound directly by the B6 PRDM9 protein, providing the first evidence for a biochemical incompatibility between the B6 Prdm9 allele and the PWD Chr X.",

First, mediation analysis was used to identify genes directly controlling the phenotype and derive measures of confidence of their involvement in the phenotype. Tyler then trained a support vector machine to classify genes within the QTL peak into each module. This method implicated Ythdf3 as a potential candidate regulator of contextual fear learning, even though this gene had never been linked to AD before.

In a site-and context-dependent manner, the presence of specific ARID subunits can promote or repress gene expression.

Dumont introduced the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), the narrow region of homology between the sex chromosomes that is critical for the proper segregation of the X and Y in most mammals. Intriguingly, this region is one of the fastest evolving loci in the mammalian genome. Dumont described how her lab is gaining mechanistic insight into the function of this region by conducting comparative analyses across different rodent species. As an example of this approach, she described recent work utilizing the natural variation in meiotic sex chromosome programs in North American voles.

Increased efficiency in genetic manipulation techniques, new systems genetics approaches, and expanded data sharing resources have substantially improved our ability to locate and validate important genes in health and disease. Furthermore, significant advances in singlecell resolution of the transcriptome, new computational approaches, and growing interest in how environmental factors influence genetics provided new insight into the complex factors that drive both developmental and disease phenotypes. The availability of these technologies in mammalian research models exemplifies a critical role for these systems in our continued forward progress.",
