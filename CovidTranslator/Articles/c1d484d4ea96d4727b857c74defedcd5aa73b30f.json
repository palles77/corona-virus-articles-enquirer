In this study, miR-208-3p was highly expressed and directly repressed ARID2 expression. As a result, ARID2 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was decreased. In vitro, miR-208-3p down-regulation and ARID2 overexpression elicited similar inhibitory effects on HCC cell proliferation and invasion. In vivo test results revealed that miR-208-3p down-regulation inhibited HCC tumorigenesis in Hep3B cells. Moreover, ARID2 was possibly a downstream element of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF\u03b21)/miR-208-3p/ ARID2 regulatory pathway. These findings suggested that miR-208-3p up-regulation is associated with HCC cell progression and may provide a new target for liver cancer treatment.",

So effective therapeutic tools, such as gene therapy, should be developed for HCC treatment. For instance, microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by binding to complementary sequences in mRNAs [4, 5] . The dysregulation of miRNAs play critical roles in tumor initiation and development. One of the well-known miRNAs is miR-21, which is highly expressed and plays important role in various types of cancers, including colon cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and HCC [6] [7] [8] [9] . In contrast, miR-34a, miR-15-/16 cluster, and let-7 miRNA are usually expressed at low levels in different malignant cancers [10] [11] [12] [13] . However, few studies have focused on cancer regulation of miR-208, which promotes cell proliferation of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and contributes to cell metastasis and invasion by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in pancreatic cancer cells [14, 15] .",

Human ARID superfamily includes 15 members, which are subunits of SWI/SNF complexes. Human ARID2 protein contains a conservative N-terminal ARID, an RFXtype winged helix, a proline-and glutamine-rich region, and two conservative C-terminal C 2 H 2 Zn-finger motifs [17] . ARID-containing proteins are involved in various biological processes, including embryonic development, cell lineage gene regulation, and cell cycle control. ARID2 is also implicated in tumor progression, as described in previous studies. For example, ARID2 have been found to be mutated and functions as a tumor suppressor gene in HCC [18, 19] . In non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, loss-of-function mutations of ARID2 have also frequently occurred [20, 21] . Although the crucial roles of ARID2 in cancer have been extensively investigated, the correlation between miR-208-3p and ARID2 in HCC remains unclear.",

            "text": "TGF\u03b21-specific siRNA was transfected into Hep3B cells separately or co-transfected with miR-208-3p mimics or control mimics to confirm whether ARID2 is a downstream response element of TGF\u03b21/miR-208-3p regulatory network. Western blot analysis was performed to analyze TGF\u03b21, ARID2 and IFITM1 protein levels, and qRT-PCR was conducted to detect miR-208-3p expression. The transfection of TGF\u03b21-specific siRNA could repress TGF\u03b21 expression, repress miR-208-3p expression, and upregulate the protein level of ARID2 and IFITM1, This effect of TGF\u03b21 siRNA on miR-208-3p, ARID2 and IFITM1 could be reversed by miR-208-3p mimics ( Fig. 6A and B) . The results of transwell and colony formation assay indicated that depeted TGF\u03b21 inhibited HCC cell invasion and colony formation ability, but the over-expression of miR-208-3p could reverse the effect of TGF\u03b21 down-regulation on HCC cells ( Fig. 6C and D) . These data suggested a new regulatory pathway, in which ARID2 is regulated by TGF\u03b21 via miR-208-3p (Fig. 6E) .",

            "text": "In the recent years, more and more researchers focused on the selection of potent therapeutic miRNAs for cancer treatment. miR-122a is minimally expressed and is inversely correlated with cyclin G1 expression in HCC [22] . In addition, miR-124 and miR-203 are down-regulated and cell growth is inhibited by regulating multiple targets during hepatocarcinogenesis [23] . By contrast, miR-181b, a TGF\u03b2-activated miRNA is up-regulated and can promote HCC cell invasion and proliferation by targeting TIMP3 [24] . Moreover, miR-21 and miR-17-92 exhibit increased expressions in HCC, and cell proliferation is significantly reduced when these two miRNAs were knocked down [9] . Previous studies showed the role of miR-208 in myocardial injury, EMT, and cancer biological regulation [14, 15, 25] . However, limited information is available regarding the role of miR-208-3p in HCC. In this study, high levels of miR-208-3p were detected in HCC speciments compared to that in paired normal hepatic tissues. In HepG2 and Hep3B cells, downregulation of miR-208-3p inhibited HCC cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, the decreased miR-208-3p inhibited HCC tumorigenesis in nude mice. Furthermore, miR-208-3p expression was inversely correlated with ARID2 expression level in HCC specimens.",

            "text": "To investigate the potential association of miR-208-3p and ARID2, we performed luciferase reporter and Western blot assays. The results showed that miR-208-3p repressed ARID2 expression and directly targeted ARID2 by binding to its 3\u2032-UTR. ARID2 undergoes mutation and functions as a tumor suppressor gene in small cell lung carcinoma and HCC [19, 20] . In this study, ARID2 expression was down-regulated, and ARID2 over-expression inhibited HCC cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, ARID2 expression could partly reverse the effect of miR-208-3p downregulation on HCC cell progression. As a subunit of PBAF, ARID2 was also found to regulate the expression of interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) [16] . IFITM1 is an IFN-induced antiviral protein which prevent multiple virus entry, including SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Dengue virus (DNV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . IFITM1 was also found to regulate cancer cell proliferation and invasion. For example, in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells, IFITM1 overexpression promoted and IFITM1 knockdown suppressed the invasion of HNSCC cells in vitro [31] . While, IFITM1 could enhance the transcriptional activity of p53 and negatively regulated HCC cell cell proliferation and tumorigenesis [32] . miR-208 was shown to be regulated by TGF\u03b21 in rat cardiac myoblasts [33] . Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signaling pathway is a doubleedged sword in tumor development. As a member of TGF\u03b2 family, dual-role of TGF\u03b21 has also been found in cancer progression. In metastatic prostate cancer cells, TGF\u03b21 was found to suppressed the growth and motility by inducing SMADs [34] . While in HCC, over-expression of TGF-\u03b21 could promote cell progression and Hepatocarcinogenesis [35, 36] . Here we found that depletion of TGF\u03b21 by siRNA repressed miR-208-3p, upregulated ARID2 and IFITM1 expression. This up-regulation of ARID2 and IFITM1 were down-regulated by transfection of miR-208-3p mimics in TGF\u03b21 siRNA and miR-208-3p mimics co-transfection group. Furthermore, the inhibition of HCC cell invasion and colony formation ability caused by TGF\u03b21 siRNA were partly reversed by miR-208-3p mimics. These results may provide insights into ARID2 regulatory network in cancer.",
