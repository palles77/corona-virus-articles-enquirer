The antigenic determinants studied were highly conserved on the El glycoproteins and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of all strains tested. In contrast, antigenic polymorphism was observed among the E2 glycoproteins. Of three previously described antigenic determinants against which neutralizing antibodies are directed, only one, termed A(E2), was conserved on all strains. Antigenic site.B(E2) was found only on the strongly neurotropic MHV4 and site C(E2) was present on the virulent MHV4 and MHV-3 (hepatotropic) strains, but absent on the weakly pathogenic MHV-A59, MHV-1 and MHV-S strains. Four non-neutralizing antibodies against at least one topographically distinct antigenic determinant, which we previously designated D(E2), gave binding patterns consistent with two distinct sites. One of these was present on all MHV strains tested and the other was present on all strains except MHV-S. These non-neutralizing antigenic sites were redesignated E(E2) and D(E2) respectively. coronavirus, antigen, glycoprotein, monoclonal antibody, epitope, polymorphism",

Despite these variations in pathogenesis, the viruses are closely related in structure and in their mode of replication. Viral RNA is complexed with N protein (& = 56-60~) and the envelope is studded with petal-shaped peplomers composed of a major glycoprotein, E2 (M, 180-200 000) made up of two nonidentical 90000 dalton subunits. A second glycoprotein, El (M, = 23-25 000), spans the membrane and interacts internally with the viral RNA. El may determine the intracellular site of virus maturation (Siddell et al., 1982; Sturman and Holmes, 1983) .",

These studies showed that MHV strains could be distinguished, but that significant levels of cross-reactivity occurred. Strains MHV-2 and 4 were closely related, as were strains MHV-1, 3, S and A59. There was no correlation between serological typing and virulence. These neutralization assays likely measured antigenic homologies at the level of the E2 glycoprotein, which is the target for neutralizing antibodies (Collins et al., 1982; Fleming et al., 1983) . Tryptic maps of the N proteins from five MHV strains also showed a strong level of similarity (Cheley et al., 1981) . Recently, antigen&c relationships among eleven MHV isolates were probed in radioi~unoassays with monoclonal antibodies to MHV4 (Fleming et al., 1983) . Extensive antigenic variation of the E2 glycoprotein was observed but a correlation was drawn between less extensive variations in the N protein and pathogenicity.

Rapidly fatal encephalitis normally masks the more slowly developing demyelinating disease in mice (Knobler et al., 1981b; Stohlman and Weiner, 1981; Weiner, 1973) . How-ever, infection with mutants or variants of MHV-4 results in survival with accompanying primary demyelination, due to infection of the oligodendrocyte (Haspel et al., 1978; Stohlman et al., 1982; Knobler et al., 1982) . Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to MHV4 structural proteins were raised and characterized as described previously (Collins et al., 1982) . A minimum of four topographically distinct antigenic determinants on E2 and two on El were mapped by competition binding assays (Talbot et al., 1984a) . At least two distinct antigenic determinants were mapped on the N protein (Talbot et al., 1985) . Antibodies to sites A, B and C(E2) were capable of neutralizing viral infectivity in vitro and passive antibody transfer experiments showed that neutralizing antibodies to sites A and B(E2) but not C(E2) could protect mice from a lethal intracerebral virus challenge. Such antibodies modulated disease from fatal encephalitis to sublethal demyelination (Buchmeier et al., 1984) . In the present study, we have used a panel of eighteen MAb to MHV4 generated in our laboratory and an independently derived panel of ten additional MAb to E2 raised by Fleming et al. (1983) to analyze antigenic relationships among six MHV strains differing in virulence and organ tropism. These were MHV4 (JHM), both the wild-type (wt) strain (Cheever et al., 1949) and the ts8 mutant (Haspel et al., 1978) ; MHV-3 (Dick et al., 1956) ; MHV-A59 (Manaker et al., 1961) ; MHV-1 (Gledhill and Andrewes, 1951); and MHV-S (Rowe et al., 1963) .",

            "text": "In this example, the variation of the neutralization sites, previously assigned to the E2 glycoprotein (Talbot et al., 1984a) , is shown for three MHV strains. Epitope A(E2), recognized by MAb 5B19.2 was conserved among these and all other MHV strains tested. In contrast, epitope B(E2), recognized by MAb 5A13.5, was unique to MHV-4. Epitope C(E2) recognized by MAb 4B11.6 was observed on MHV4 and MHV-3 but not on the other strains tested. Staining of control uninfected cells with these MAb was always at background negative levels. A second antigen-binding assay was developed to confirm antigenic relationships initially determined by indirect immunofluorescence. We have previously used the dot blotting assay to analyze detergent sensitivities of different viral epitopes (Talbot et al., 1984b) . In the present study, this assay was modified into a solid-phase radioimmunoassay using nitrocellulose as an efficient antigen-binding matrix. The is 250 x assay was very sensitive and quantitative (Jahn et al., 1984; Talbot et al., 1984b) , and also provided a visual representation of results. determined by enzyme immunoassay to be in excess of that required for maximal antibody binding was applied on the nitrocellulose solid support. Serial dilutions of MAb culture fluids were then reacted and detected with a radiolabeled second antibody. After autoradiography, each dot was cut out and counted for *\"I radioactivity. Comparisons between antibody binding on viral antigens from different MHV strains were established in the linear portion of the binding curves and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 2 . Binding of each MAb to control antigen dots was negligible (400-500 cpm), whereas specific binding on viral antigen dots reached levels of up to 13 000 cpm. Background binding on MHV-1 was often higher than on the other MHV strains (Fig. 2 , MAb 5A13.5 and 4B11.6) and this background binding was not diluted out with decreasing concentration of antibody. In agreement with the results of Fleming et al. (1983) , extensive conservation of the El glycoprotein was evident and similar levels of antibody binding were seen on each MHV strain, with the exception of the ts8 mutant of MHV-4. Antigenic variation was observed in the N protein, particularly with MHV-A59 and MHV-S. However, the most extensive polymorphism was seen on the E2 glycoprotein. As was shown by indirect immunofluorescence, site A(E2) was conserved among all MHV strains tested, whereas site B(E2) was specific for MHV-4 and site C(E2) was specific for MHV-4 and MHV-3. Four non-neutralizing MAb directed against at least one antigenic site provisionally designated D(E2) (Talbot et al., 1984a) gave two distinct binding patterns. MAb 5B21.5 and -5B93.7 reacted with all strains tested except MHV-S, whereas MAb 5B207.3 and 5B216.8 reacted with all of the strains we tested. Thus, these two pairs of antibodies likely recognize at least two different structures on the E2 glycoprotein, which we have redefined D(E2) and E(E2), respectively. In order to confirm the antigenic polymorphism observed on the E2 glycoprotein, we obtained a panel of MAb against E2 generated independently by Fleming et al. (1983) , and assayed these antibodies for strain-specific binding in the dot immunoblotting assay described above. Results of such an experiment are shown in Fig. 3 . Polymorphism similar in extent to that described above was also observed with these antibodies. Moreover, similarities in binding patterns emerged between these. two panels of MAb. MAb 5.1.2, 5.2.2 and 5.7.2 were similar to our neutralizing MAb 4B11.6 and 5.7.18 was similar to our 5A13.5. All of these antibodies, except 5.1.2 neutralized virus in vitro (Fleming et al., 1983; Collins et al., 1982) . Non-neutralizing antibodies 5.7.1 and 5.1.16 showed a similar binding pattern to that of antibodies against nonneutralizing site E (5B207.3 and 5B216.8). The binding pattern of antibodies to antigenic site D was not observed with the Fleming panel of antibodies. Conversely, the specificity patterns of antibodies 5.2.5 and 5.2.6, as well as that of 5.7.5 and 5.7.6 were unique to the panel obtained from Fleming.",

An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) which we have previously described (Talbot et al., 1984a) was applied to the present study. We found EIA to be less sensitive than either the immunofluorescence or dot blotting assays when MAb culture fluids were used. Thus, it was necessary to concentrate these fluids to be used in EIA. Nevertheless, only ten of eighteen MAb could reliably be used in the assay. The cumulative results of the EIA are combined with results of the two other antigen-binding assays and presented in Table 1 . In dot immunoblotting assays and EIA, a positive reaction was scored as greater than twice background binding. A plus or minus reaction corresponded to approximately twice background binding and' a negative reaction to less than twice background binding. The results of all three antigen binding assays generally agreed, with a few exceptions. For example, EIA results were sometimes negative but dot blotting and immunofluorescence results scored as positive, such as MAb 5B19.2 and 5B170.3 with MHV-1 and S, MAb 5B119.6 and 5B11.5 for MHV-1 and MAb 5B188.2 for MHV4 ts8. Similarly, dot blotting results could be negative while immunofluorescence was positive, such as MAb 5B39.1 and 5B175.5 for MHV4 rs8, MAb 5B145.5 for MHV-A59 and S and MAb 4B6.2 for MHV-A59. In the latter case, EIA results were also positive. Such discrepancies likely result from differences in assay sensitivity and/or antigen stability.",

In agreement with studies of Fleming and colleagues (Fleming et al., 1983) , we found extensive conservation of antigenic determinants on the internal viral protein N, and particularly on the transmembrane glycoprotein, El. Using eighteen MAb against the peplomer glycoprotein, E2 and raised in two laboratories, we found significant antigenic polymorphism on this glycoprotein. In contrast to the report of Fleming and colleagues (Fleming et al., 1983) , we found that antigenic variation of the E2 glycoprotein was a better correlate of pathogenicity of a given virus strain than was variation in the N protein. Variation on E2 has been correlated with previously mapped antigenic determinants (Talbot et al., 1984a) . Neutralizing antibodies 5A13.5 and 4B11.6 are directed against two topographically distinct antigenic determinants designated B and C(E2), respectively (Talbot et al., 1984a) . In separate studies, detection of these two determinants was found to be dependent on the native conformation of the molecule (Talbot et al., 1984b) . In the present study, we found minimal conservation of these two antigenic sites in the MHV strains tested: site B(E2) was only recognized on the MHV-4 strain, which is known to be strongly neurotropic (Siddell et al., 1983; Wege et al., 1982) and site C(E2) was preserved on the two virulent strains MHV4 and MHV-3 but absent on the weakly pathogenic strains MHV-A59, MHV-1 and MHV-S.",

Conservation of this determinant and its resistance to antibody selection may indicate a structure that is essential for productive infection. Conservation of site A(E2) may account for the reported cross-neutralization between different MHV strains (Childs et al., 1983; Hierholzer et al., 1979; Taguchi et al., 1982; Wege et al., 1981) . In other studies (Talbot et al., 1985) we have shown that mice infected with MHV-4, A-59, MHV-1 and MHV-S all respond by producing antibody to site A(E2). Finally, non-neutralizing sites D and E(E2), which are also stable to SDS denaturation (Talbot et al., 1984b) , are extensively conserved among MHV strains, with the exception of MHV-S which has lost site D(E2).",

In our study using three different antigen binding assays, we assumed that a positive reaction in any one of the assays was an indication of antigenic conservation and that only in those instances where a negative reaction was obtained in all assays could we conclude a loss of antigenic determinants.

This report differs from the previously reported studies in that we found a better correlation between antigenic variation, organ tropism and virulence at the level of the E2 glycoprotein rather than the previously reported correlation in N. This may reflect the larger number of E2 antibodies employed in the present study. We have also confirmed the identity of each MHV as a separate strain with a distinctive mosaic of antigenic markers. More detailed structural studies on E2, its functional properties, and interaction(s) with cellular receptors will be helpful to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis for coronavirus tropism and virulence.",
