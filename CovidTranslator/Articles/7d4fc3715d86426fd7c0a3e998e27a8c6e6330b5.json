Use of face-to-face-semi structured interviews with supply side providers in Thailand results in recognizing safety measures to ask tourists about, other than those found in the literature. Researchers collected questionnaire data from international leisure and business tourists to Thailand on importance of safety and security measures. Analysis of the importance of 23 safety and security measures show a six factor pattern in thinking about measures. However, the most important measure is not in a factor. Therefore, the study considers analysis method issues and raises questions about the value of structured data and merits of the recognition of if-then conditions by research methods such as long interviews. Examination of practical, theoretical and methodological values of findings includes considering research needed and the utility of safety measure information in business decision making.",

A suggestion is that service providers install safety devices and take other safety and security measures (Palmer, 1989) . Experts advise travel agents to avoid booking a hotel or sending their clients to a potentially unsafe destination without having proof of issuing a warning (Cavlek, 2002; Wilks & Page, 2003) . As a result of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, airport personnel issued face masks and had tourists go through thermal detectors (McKercher & Chon, 2004) . Following the 2006 tsunami, officials are implementing safety measures such as tsunami warning systems (Rittichainuwat, 2006 (Rittichainuwat, , 2008 (Rittichainuwat, , 2011 . Governments and service providers implement different types of safety measures, but which of these measures are important to tourists? If someone asks about importance of safety and security measures, how does one use survey responses like very important to very unimportant in understanding demands and in making decisions about provision? For example, how should researchers and clients interpret and use any differences in perceived importance of safety measures between leisure and business tourists in decision making?",

In fact, research finds that safety and security are the most important travel considerations for some tourists (Pizam, Tarlow, & Bloom 1996; Rittichainuwat, 2005; Roehl & Fesenmaier, 1992; Ryan, 1993; S\u00f6nmez, Apostolopoulos, & Tarlow, 1999; S\u00f6nmez & Graefe, 1998) . Safety refers to protection of customers and employees from potential injury or death (Enz, 2009) . Security is guarding against loss of life, belongings and property . According to the (US) National Crime Prevention Institute (1986) and Bach and Pizam (1996) , research can categorize safety and security measures by: 1) using physical devices and 2) involving employees' behavioral procedures. Physical devices include surveillance systems, such as closed circuit TV (Enz, 2009) , and intrusion detection systems such as alarms (NCPI, 1986) . Employee behavioral procedures can relate to a crisis management plan. A written plan can specify informing tourists of hazards (NCPI, 1986) , listing actions to occur in a crisis and identifying continuing action to see that when needed actions in the plan occur (Kohr, 1994) .",

Tarlow and Santana (2002) recognize training to improve foreign language skills of security personnel as an important behavioral measure. Lois, Wall, and Ruxton (2004) determine that guests want announcements and survival manuals in multilingual printed form to inform them of emergency instructions and evacuation procedures. Milman et al. (1999) show the installation of safety devices and behavioral security measures reduces tourists' anxiety and increases their sense of safety, especially among tourists who have had previous exposure to instances of crime. Palmer (1989) acknowledges that providing safety and security can be complicated. Devices do not necessarily deliver security because of image quality or malfunction (Saied, 1990) .",

Because of previous travel experience, frequent business tourists are less risk averse than first time leisure tourists (Sirakaya & Woodside, 2005) . Compared to business tourists, leisure tourists are more likely to accept obtrusive safety measures such as metal detectors, background checks and armed guards (Feickert et al., 2006) . Although business tourists are less seasonal and less sensitive to price and negative publicity than leisure tourists, business tourists do not overlook safety and security (Withiam, 1998) . Frequent-travel business tourists consider safety and security in hotel selection (Knutson, 1988) . Female business tourists are more concerned about security than their male counterparts (McCleary, Weaver, & Zhao, 1993) , especially regarding physical devices such as a spy hole in a door and a deadlock on the entry door (Sammons, Moreo, Benson, & DeMicco, 1999) . Luxury and upscale hotels acknowledge what business tourists want and tend to invest in what these tourists want . Business tourists tend to expect fewer safety features at relaxing beach resorts than they do at airports and urban hotels .",

Such surveys may not capture unconscious thoughts (Woodside, 2004) , and 95% of thought is sub-conscious (Woodside & Wilson, 2003) . However, using long interviews to collect data involves high consumption of time and thus usually of research dollars. Also, a drawback of long interviews is drawing inferences such as proportions of a population being in a certain category (Wilson & Woodside, 1999; Woodside et al., 2004) . A combination of data collection methods provides a way to gain in depth insights and adequately reliable statistics.

Three items (photo ID checks at airport and at hotels and closed circuit TV) are in the literature and occur in interviews. Therefore, the structured questionnaire contains 23 safety measures, which are listed in Table 2 . Based on the literature (e.g., see Milman et al., 1999) , the researchers rate the importance of each safety measures on a five-point scale (1 = very unimportant, 5 = very important). Table 2 gives a short version of text used in the safety and security measure statements printed in the questionnaire. In addition to safety and security questions, the questionnaire has sections on travel behaviors and demographic attributes of respondents. Questions include trip purpose, type of accommodation, gender and age group. With questions drafted, long interview respondents were to review the safety and security measure items and faculty members in the field of travel and tourism reviewed the instrument.

The program forces the 18 safety measures contributing to the six factor solution (Table 3) to load on only one of the six factors, as identified in Table 3 . All cross-loadings are constrained to zero. The Chi-square test for the model is significant (\u03c7 2 = 199.4 with 120 df, p-value b 0.0001). Being significant is not surprising given the sample size close to 300 (N = 297). However, the fit indices are also good (NFI= 0.90, TLI = 0.95, CFI= 0.96) and the RMSEA is excellent (0.047). All of the factor loadings are statistically significant (p-values less than 0.01). Thus, overall, the CFA results show a good measurement model. In other words, in accord with H2, respondents tend to think about 18 of 23 safety and security measures in a systematic way reflecting attributes of the measures.

One reason to use six composite variables is that with only 61 business respondents, the results consider differences between leisure and business segments based on variables with lower within segment variability than individual importance ratings for a safety or security measure. To create the six composite variables, the study averages the items loading on each of the six factors of Table 3 . Cronbach's Alpha values for some of the six composite variables are greater than 0.8. The value of 0.8 is appropriate for research concerning groups of individuals. Researchers often site lower values for factors in Table 3 as acceptable (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994) , but Shelby (2011) cautions against only using Cronbach's alpha to measure scale reliability. In fact, having derived the six factors based on correlation between importance ratings, assessing reliability by a measure of correlation between ratings involves circular logic.

However, in what way does having a similar factor structure mean responding similarly? One way the perceived importance of safety and security measures could vary between leisure and business tourists is in the distribution of responses. For example, the means of distributions could differ. A twogroup t-test can determine whether the means for the six safety and security variables based on factors differ. Table 4 shows the results of the test. Means differ on evacuation plan (t = 4.43, p-value b 0.01) crisis management (t = 3.76, p-value b 0.01) and emergency kits (t = 2.02, p-value b 0.05). Business and leisure tourists may show a similar factor structure but the differing means show the segments do not respond similarly for some factors (i.e., they respond around different means). Table 4 , three differences out of six are positive and significant at the 0.05 level and only one difference is negative, inferences are possible. If only one difference out of six were, significant that might be dismissed by chance. However, when more than one difference occurs and two differences are over 3.5 standard deviations, the chance that differences between business and leisure tourists occur by chance is near zero (i.e., the probability of drawing two observations greater than 3.5 and one greater than 2.0 in 6 draws from a normal zero-one distribution is b .000001). Therefore, Table 4 justifies concluding that for leisure tourists on average rate higher than business tourists on some categories of safety and security measures. The significant differences in means have implications for accepting hypotheses. Unfortunately, responding around different means need not imply rejecting H2. Rejecting H2 depends on the interpretation of H2. Structure exists in the way leisure and business tourists respond. Even if the structure differed, researchers could accept H2 if for both segments structure related to the nature of safety and security measures. Difference in means between the segments does not show a lack of structure in responses but rather a difference in structure. Though H2 may seem like a reasonable hypothesis, H2 is not precise enough to allow its rejection or acceptance. For H3 the impression raised by possibly sharing factor structure across segments is rejecting H3 is reasonable. However, significantly different means existing shows rating differences exist. Therefore, accepting H3 is possible.",

A variable not being included in a factor shows that responses do not show respondents exhibiting consensus on the variable relating to other variables (i.e., responses on the variable have low correlation with responses on other variables).",

The \"Segment difference\" column of Table 2 gives segment mean differences in standard deviations using simple subtraction. A first important thing to note is that except for two differences, leisure means exceed business means. Looking at six factor hides the pervasiveness of positive differences. The biggest difference is for linking evacuation warning to rooms which is .54. This item is in factor 5 with beach warning. Respondents rating high or low on one warning tend to rate the same way on the other. If business tourists are mostly not staying where a tourist feels a warning is needed, is the difference in means a surprise? Asking a question reflects the fact that an if-then situation exists without data to draw a conclusion. The second largest difference (.46) is for announcing evacuation in major languages. Given the difference for warnings, is the large difference for announcements a surprise? What may be surprising is that announcement is not in the 6-factor solution.",

Based on distances between means being about two standard deviations or larger, over half the 23 safety and security items have means that differ significantly between business and leisure tourists. Having similar factor structures for business and leisure tourists merits academic interest in showing that items with similar attributes group together. However, given that tsunami warning systems (Factor 5) depend on different providers than either having warnings linked to a hotel room (Factor 5) or announcements being in major languages (not included in a factor), a practical application problem is clear. While using factor analysis can produce interesting results, focus on factors only can conceal the most important item (based on mean) and information different authorities need to see by consolidation into a summative ratings as occurs for all factors. Results above allow reflection on H4. Problems exist with the claim that tourists' safety and security importance ratings are good information for service provider decision making. Differences may just reflect supply used. A business traveler coming as a leisure tourist may respond differently because of traveling with family and being exposed to different risks associated with different activities and accommodations. Supply-side interviews show the kind of accommodations that business tourists use tend to offer different safety and security than some leisure tourist accommodations. Furthermore, if most business tourists are not near a beach, how do they answer questions about tsunamis or other beach-related safety concerns? For Thailand, is the tourist destination in the country currently a determinant of terrorism threat? Differences in means between business and leisure tourists reflect more than attitudes. They reflect if-then conditions that researchers need to know even to discount a condition making a difference.",

Accepting H3, in fact, is confirmation that treating importance rating factor structure in the data as providing a useful simplification for making decisions and understanding behavior is flawed.

For example, long interview data show hoteliers have invested significantly in the installation of closed circuit TV and that many locations require guests to present their passport upon check-in. However, inbound tourists do not perceive such measures as very important (more than 65% of respondents consider these as neutral or unimportant). Other studies have similar findings (Palmer, 1989; Saied, 1990) . However, inbound survey results differ from those of some other research. Feickert et al. (2006) found positive attitudes of USA tourists toward video surveillance, photo identification, and first aid kits in the hotel room. The inbound data show that less than 17% of respondents from the USA consider these important. Studies show that tourists perceive physical devices, such as emergency power sources and photo ID checks as important in the hotels regardless of size (Bach & Pizam, 1996; Kwortnik, 2005; Milman et al., 1999) . However, findings of others differ (Donoho, 1993; Kohr, 1994; NCPI, 1986) . They find importance of some of these only at brand hotels. Recognizing a difference exists is raising a research question. Maybe, examination of why the difference occurs would lead to some important insight. Interviewees in 2011 allowed examination of matters that were problematic. Collecting more data using the structured questionnaire would not have clarified matters. Long interviews can be valuable in formulating structured data collection and vice versa. Doing research involving new data collection to address a rather obscure difference is a questionable use of resources. Making data available after research is published, could however encourage research on understanding differences between studies.",
