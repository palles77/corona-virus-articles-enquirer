The mortality rates of the F1 hybrids and of the F2 segregants showed the codominance of the susceptible and resistant characters. The direct individual intrapopulation correlation between the induction of antiviral state in macrophages activated by IFN gamma and the resistance to the virus infection, showed that an antiviral state could be induced in resistant mouse macrophages, whereas in susceptible mouse macrophages no restriction of virus replication could be observed. A direct inter-and intrapopulation correlation of pre-existing antibody titres against MHV3 with the mortality and a direct interpopulation correlation of those titres with the mean survival time of susceptible animals was shown. The data indicate, among the mechanisms of resistance against the virus infection, a role of IFN gamma macrophage-activation and of antibodies against MHV3 which may delay the mean survival time in susceptible animals.",

One of the mechanisms suggested to be involved in the resistance against this virus infection was the ability of macrophages to develop an antiviral state following IFN gamma activation [2, 233. The present study was undertaken in an attempt to investigate whether the sensitivity ofmacrophages to the induction of an antiviral state and the antibody responsiveness characters, correlated individually with the resistance to MHV3 and were influenced at least partially by the same genetic control. Therefore the investigation was directed towards a co-inherited expression of the two traits, aiming to elucidate the complexity of the biological factors that intervene in resistance to infection.",
