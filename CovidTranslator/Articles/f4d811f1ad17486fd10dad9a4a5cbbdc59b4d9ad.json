Incidence of laboratory-confirmed human cases dramatically decreased following the closure of live poultry markets (LPMs) in affected cities in April 2013 (3) . Control of the virus is challenging because its low pathogenicity in poultry (4) requires reliance on laboratorybased surveillance in animals or humans to identify areas where the virus is prevalent and to facilitate interventions to reduce human exposure to infected poultry.",

Table 1 shows a summary of the population anxiety and risk perception related to influenza A(H7N9) across the 2 survey periods. The level of general anxiety in the population, measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (5,6), remained low and was comparable to population anxiety during April-May 2009 (6) . Most (85%-89%) respondents identified close contact with chickens in an LPM as a risk factor for infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus. Respondents reported perceived susceptibility of infection as low, perceived severity of influenza A(H7N9) as lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome, and perceived severity of influenza A(H7N9) as higher than that of influenza A(H5N1) and seasonal influenza. Respondents also expressed that they would experience low levels of worry if influenza-like symptoms were to develop in the respondent the day after the survey (symptom-induced worry).",
