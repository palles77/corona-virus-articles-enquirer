However, safe and potent adjuvants, especially with more efficient and economical needle-free vaccination are always needed more urgently in a pandemic. The development of a safe and effective mucosal adjuvant and vaccine for prevention of emergent infectious diseases such as SARS will be an important advancement. PIKA, a stabilized derivative of Poly (I:C), was previously reported to be safe and potent as adjuvant in mouse models. In the present study, we demonstrated that the intraperitoneal and intranasal co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine together with this improved Poly (I:C) derivative induced strong anti-SARS-CoV mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses with neutralizing activity against pseudotyped virus. Although intraperitoneal immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine alone could induce a certain level of neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites, co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with PIKA as adjuvant could induce a much higher neutralizing activity. When intranasal immunization was used, PIKA was obligatorily for inducing neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites and was correlated with both mucosal IgA and mucosal IgG response. Overall, PIKA could be a good mucosal adjuvant candidate for inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine for use in possible future pandemic.",

The appropriate anti-SARS-CoV antibody response, especially at diverse mucosal surfaces, would play a crucial role in protection against mucosal transmission of SARS-CoV. For example, the passive transfer of neutralizing serum antibody to naive mice prevented SARS-CoV replication in the lower respiratory tract following intranasal challenge [35] . Prophylactic administration of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody reduced replication of SARS-CoV in the lungs of infected ferrets, preventing the development of SARS-CoV induced macroscopic lung pathology [39] . Besides, mucosal secretory IgA in the lower respiratory tract, immune protection in the digestive tract and other mucosal sites seems to be crucially important given the fact that transmission of SARS-CoV occurs by direct contact with droplets of the virus by the fecal or oral routes [37] . Taken together, these reports suggest that a wide range of humoral immunity in systemic and diverse mucosal surfaces may play an important role in vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV transmission.",

Recently, Poly(I:C) was discovered to function as an adjuvant through its interaction with TLR3, which in turn activates the NF-\u03baB pathway, resulting in stable maturation of DCs, activation of NK cells and longer-time survival of activated CD4 + T cells in vitro [42] . Ichinohe et al. [11] reported that intranasal vaccination of hemaglutinin (HA) adjuvanted with Poly(I:C) can induce protection against influenza viral infection in mice. Brian R. Sloat also showed that nasal immunization with anthrax PA plus Poly(I:C) can enhance the production of mucosal and systemic immunities [34] . Therefore, Poly(I:C) represents another potential adjuvant. However, Poly(I:C) itself is unsuitable as a potential adjuvant because it is toxic and can be rapidly hydrolyzed in humans when used alone [6] . Several Poly(I:C) derivatives have been suggested, such as Poly(ICLC), which is Poly (I:C) containing Poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose [2] , to minimize observed deficiencies of Poly (I:C).",

Intranasal immunization appeared less effective than intraperitoneal immunization at eliciting neutralizing activity, even when adjuvanted with PIKA.

If this is true, the in vitro neutralizing activity may only reflect partial correlation with the protection effect of immune response.",

However, the adjuvant mechanism of Poly(I:C) is not clearly understood yet although it is believed to be related with to dsRNA structure and TLR3 mediated immune response. In-vivo, the presence of viral dsRNA can trigger cellular immune responses to viral infection through the activation of dsRNA-dependent enzymes including PKR, and the IFN-inducible 2'-5'-adenylate synthase/Rnase L system [12, 16] . In addition, mammalian TLR3's can recognize viral dsRNA, leading to the activation of NF-\u03baB and the production of type 1 interferons which can serve as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems [1] .

To evaluate the optimal concentration of PIKA as an adjuvant, mice were immunized either intraperitoneally (i.p.) or intranasally (i.n.) with inactivated SARS-CoV alone (10\u00b5g), or SARS-CoV (10\u00b5g) plus different concentrations of PIKA (50\u00b5g /dose, 100\u00b5g /dose, 250\u00b5g /dose). All mice were immunized three times, and then serum and lung tissues were collected 2 weeks after the last immunization. SARS-CoV-specific serum IgG and lung IgA titers were determined in diluted samples using ELISA. Each bar represents the arithmetic OD value of individual group \u00b1 SE. The statistical significance of the difference between groups was calculated by Tukey's test.100 \u00b5g PIKA as the adjuvant showed a significant IgA response in lung. The group of mice immunized intranasally with the higher dose of 250 \u00b5g PIKA showed an equivalent level of IgA response in lung (p>0.05) as the group receiving 100 \u00b5g of PIKA (Fig.1B). Other tests showed similar results (data not shown). Thus, 100 \u00b5g of PIKA was chosen as the optimal adjuvant dose in the following experiments. PIKA can help inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine elicit higher neutralizing activity Neutralizing antibodies are the key components in the protective immune response to SARS-CoV infection because they can bind to viral particles and block them from entering the host cells. We first tested the adjuvanticity of PIKA in inducing neutralizing activity in pooled serum with an in vitro neutralization assay based on the SARS-CoV pseudovirus system. As shown in Fig. 2A, a high neutralizing titer in serum (about 1:477) could be detected in mice intraperitoneally immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV antigen alone. About twenty-five times higher serum neutralizing antibody titers could be induced in mice by co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV antigen with PIKA (p=0.015). Intranasal immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV antigen with PIKA could also induce neutralizing antibody (1:167 titer) in serum. But intranasal immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV antigen alone could not induce detectable neutralizing activity in serum. Given the fact that SARS-CoV can initiate its infection at diverse mucosal sites, we also tested the neutralizing activity in pooled mucosal samples, including lung washing fluid, intestine washing fluid, vagina washing fluid and saliva. Intranasal (i.n.) Fig. 2C) and lung washing fluid (Fig. 2D) respectively. However, there was no undetectable neutralizing activity in any of the three mucosal samples from the mice i.n. immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV antigen alone. Interestingly, intraperitoneal immunization with only antigen could induce detectable neutralizing activity in intestine (Fig. 2B), vagina (Fig. 2C) and lung (Fig. 2D) mucosal samples, the same as observed in serum (Fig. 2A), which suggested that the route of immunization plays a role in the induction of neutralizing activity. When PIKA was administered intraperitoneally together with antigen it induced a much higher mucosal neutralizing activity compared to mice immunized with antigen alone (Fig. 2B-D) (p<0.05), which showed the significant adjuvant effect of PIKA. For saliva, no detectable neutralizing activity could be detected in mice intranasally immunized with antigen alone or plus PIKA as an adjuvant.] In mice interperitoneally immunized with antigen alone, while low neutralizing activity could be detected in mice interperitoneally immunized with antigen plus PIKA (Fig 2E). Overall, the results showed that PIKA can help inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine elicit higher neutralizing activity in serum and mucosal secretions. PIKA can help inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine induce higher IgA response Secretory IgA antibodies in mucosal surfaces can contribute to the protection against viral infection via immune exclusion, intracellular neutralization and immune excretion",

IgA response in mucosal secretions is a very important criterion to evaluate mucosal immunity. For this purpose, all mucosal samples were collected and the SARS-CoV specific secretory IgA antibodies were measured by ELISA.

Meanwhile, an IgG titer of 1: 10 332 was induced in lung by intraperitoneal immunization with PIKA but an] IgG titer of only 1:423 was induced without PIKA, whereas a lower IgG titer of about 1: 1 500 was induced by intranasal immunization with PIKA but no discernable IgG titer could be detected without PIKA. SARS-CoV specific IgG antibodies in the sera were also tested (Fig. 4B). Intraperitoneal immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine together with PIKA induced a high IgG titer of 1: 600 000 in serum, which was 5 times the titer induced by immunization by antigen alone (p=0.002). Whereas intranasal immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine together with PIKA induced significantly higher IgG titers than intranasal immunization with inactivated SARS-CoV antigen alone (p =0.028). Specificity of antibody in serum and intestine extract can be confirmed by western blot To test if serum IgG and mucosal IgA induced by immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine together with PIKA have SARS-CoV spike protein specificity or not, Western blot assay was performed (Fig. 5). First of all, S', a segment of SARS-CoV S protein (about 60kDa) was identified by traditional Western blot with convalescent serum (diluted 1:4 500) of a SARS patient, (figure 5 lane 1) together with the negative control tested with normal human serum (lane 2). The same S' protein was then used for Western blot assay for serum IgG (diluted 1:500) from the mice intranasally immunized with inactivated SARS-Western blot assay of specific serum IgG and intestinal IgA from mice intranasally adjuvanted with PIKA (10\u00b5g antigen plus PIKA). Lane 1, Specific serum IgG from SARS patient; 2, Serum IgG of normal human; 3, Specific serum IgG from immunized mice; 4, Serum IgG from mice immunized with PBS; 5, Specific intestinal IgA from immunized mice; 6, Intestinal IgA from mice immunized with PBS. CoV (10\u00b5g) plus PIKA. Positive results were obtained and one positive example (serum IgG diluted by 1:500) was presented in lane 3 together with an unimmunized mouse negative control in lane 4. While the same test was performed for intestine; IgA from the mice intranasally immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV (10\u00b5g) plus PIKA, a specific band could also be detected by anti-mouse IgA secondary antibody and an example of 1:40 diluted intestine sample was presented in lane 5, with lane 6 for an unimmunized mouse intestine sample as negative control. Therefore there was spike protein specific IgG and IgA induced in serum and in intestine respectively by intranasal immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine together with PIKA as adjuvant. DISCUSSION In this study we tested the adjuvanticity of PIKA, a derivative of Poly(I:C), as parenteral and mucosal adjuvant for the induction of humoral immune responses by co-administration with inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine. Our resultssuggest that both intraperitoneal and intranasal administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine together with PIKA could induce significantly higher neutralizing activity, specific IgA and IgG responses in systemic and mucosal sites. PIKA was even more effective as an adjuvant than CpG in inducing antibody responses for inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine (data not shown). Although intraperitoneal immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine alone could induce a certain level of neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites(Fig. 2), co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with PIKA as adjuvant could induce much higher neutralizing activity. Furthermore, when an intranasal immunization was adopted, PIKA was obligatorily needed for inducing neutralizing activity (Fig. 2). Some other studies showed similar phenomena when alum, IL-1, IL-12 and GM-CSF were used as adjuvants and delivered through the parenteral route;",
