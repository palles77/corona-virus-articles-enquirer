Certaines situations peuvent toutefois n\u00e9cessiter la suspension de ce droit. \u00c9tait-ce le cas lors de la crise du SRAS \u00e0 Toronto en 2003? Selon Gu\u00e9na\u00ebl R.M. Rodier, la d\u00e9cision de l'OMS de publier un avertissement aux voyageurs \u00e9tait valable, et m\u00eame raisonnable, bien qu'elle ait caus\u00e9 des pertes de plus d'1,1 milliard de dollars dans la R\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto. Le fait que les d\u00e9placements vers les zones infect\u00e9es aient \u00e9t\u00e9 le lien \u00e9pid\u00e9miologique le plus commun entre les personnes infect\u00e9es par le SRAS vient corroborer cette position. Cependant, comme l'indique le Rapport Naylor, la publication d'un avertissement aux voyageurs n'a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 des sujets infect\u00e9s de quitter Toronto; or, ces sujets ont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cinq cas sur six dans la propagation du SRAS en provenance du Canada. D'un simple point de vue logistique, cet argument mine la th\u00e8se de Rodier et met en doute le bien-fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de l'OMS. Mais il faut aussi tenir compte de l'aspect moral. L'avertissement aux voyageurs a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en oeuvre \u00e9quitablement? Le meilleur moyen d'envisager cette question est d'utiliser le cadre pour la sant\u00e9 publique de Nancy E. Kass. Deux points ressortent imm\u00e9diatement de ce cadre. Premi\u00e8rement, on n'a pas laiss\u00e9 aux autorit\u00e9s torontoises la possibilit\u00e9 de plaider leur cause aupr\u00e8s de l'OMS avant la publication de l'avertissement aux voyageurs. Et deuxi\u00e8mement, le cadre pr\u00e9cise que le fardeau des cons\u00e9quences doit \u00eatre distribu\u00e9 \u00e9quitablement. Or on ne l'a pas fait, ni m\u00eame tent\u00e9 de le faire, pour cet avertissement. F reedom of movement is a fundamental right under the Charter as well as under international human rights codes.

It was demonstrated how quickly an illness could be passed around the world from modest beginnings. Left unchecked, the SARS outbreak would have extended to millions around the globe. 3 As Singer et al. argue: \"This shows the urgent need for people around the world to adopt the value of solidarity as much for self interest as altruistic reasons\". 4 And that same value of solidarity is fundamental to an understanding as to why movement within and between countries had to be curtailed. 4 Yet, as Farquharson et al. report, \"77% of the total cases of SARS are the result of exposure within the hospital setting\". 5 Or as Svoboda et al. report, \"SARS in Toronto was primarily a nosocomial illness, largely restricted to persons who were exposed in affected hospitals and their household contacts. The few cases of second-degree and third-degree community penetration mostly involved persons with very close social ties\". 6 Despite this fact, WHO announced its travel advisory for Toronto on April 23 rd , 2003.

In applying this framework to WHO's travel advisory for Toronto, we must first ask what the goals of the advisory were. It is clear from Rodier's explanation of WHO's rationale for the decision that WHO was seeking to prevent the spread of SARS to other countries. Certainly that is a justifiable purpose. And it squares with Kass's view that the goal should \"be expressed in terms of public health improvement, that is, in terms of reduction of morbidity or mortality.\" 10 We should next consider, therefore, how effective WHO's advisory was in achieving this goal. This is where WHO's policy falters. The aim of WHO's advisory was, in part, to curtail travel to Toronto, and it was effective in this regard. However, the travel advisory did not target the travel of high-risk individuals from Toronto -and that was the real threat.",

The known burden of the WHO travel advisory was a severe economic shortage for Toronto's tourist industry. Toronto lost an estimated CAD$ 1.13 billion due to the advisory. A burden that onerous would have to be justified by a very effective, efficient plan. As has been argued, the travel advisory was not such a plan. One could conceive of WHO's issuing an instructive warning to people who may have been in contact with a patient who has SARS, describing the early signs of SARS and instructing people to obey quarantines at their local hospital or other facility. This would have served the purpose of the travel advisory without the harmful burdens. And this is precisely the challenge of Kass's fourth step -to devise an alternate plan if one is available.",

            "text": "In consideration of Kass's fifth stepwhether the program was implemented fairly one can point to the fact that the Toronto authorities were not given an opportunity to state their case to WHO before the advisory was issued. There seems little reason for this oversight. It has been suggested that it was due to delays in the city's internal SARS detection and reporting systems. In addition, SARS cases in Toronto were initially hand counted rather than entered into a global database. Further, the Toronto health care authorities typically communicated with provincial authorities, and them with federal authorities. It may be that these types of built-in delays discouraged WHO from communicating freely with the Toronto health care authorities. But more importantly, it meant that WHO was basing their advisory on old data. And it should be noted, further to Kass's point, that this step \"corresponds to the ethics principle of distributive justice, requiring the fair distribution of benefits and burdens.\" 10 By no means did the WHO advisory represent a policy that attempted to distribute the burdens of SARS evenly on the global system. Kass says that \"unequal distributions of programs must be justified with data\" and there are none forthcoming that would justify the travel advisory. 10 Rodier suggests that had a travel advisory been in place before the outbreak in Toronto, it may have prevented the spread of SARS to Toronto, but the evidence is that SARS was carried to Canada by a single person from Hong Kong and there is no evidence that that person would have changed their travel plans had an advisory been placed on Hong Kong. This raises the sixth, and final, step in Kass's analysis -how can the benefits and burdens of the program be fairly balanced? As Kass argues:",

However, it can be said that if the travel advisory did meet the other conditions, it would indeed pass this sixth test.
