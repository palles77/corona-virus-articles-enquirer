            "text": "Membrane fusion induced by the envelope glycoprotein enables the intracellular replication of HIV-1; hence, this process constitutes a major target for antiretroviral compounds. It has been proposed that peptides having propensity to interact with membrane interfaces might exert broad antiviral activity against enveloped viruses. To test this hypothesis, in this contribution we have analyzed the antiviral effects of peptides derived from the membrane-proximal external region and the transmembrane domain of the envelope glycoprotein subunit gp41, which display different degrees of interfacial hydrophobicity. Our data support the virucidal activity of a region that combines hydrophobic-at-interface membrane-proximal external region aromatics with hydrophobic residues of the transmembrane domain, and contains the absolutely conserved 679 LWYIK/R 683 sequence, proposed to embody a ''cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus'' motif. We further sought to correlate the antiviral activity of these peptides and their effects on membranes that mimic lipid composition and biophysical properties of the viral envelope. The data revealed that peptides endowed with virucidal activity were membrane active and induced permeabilization and fusion of virus-like lipid vesicles. In addition, they modulated lipid packing and miscibility of laterally segregated liquid domains, two properties that depend on the high cholesterol content of the viral membrane. Thus, the overall experimental evidence is consistent with a pattern of HIV inhibition that involves direct alteration of the physical chemistry of the virus membrane. Furthermore, the sequence-dependent effects observed might guide the development of new virucidal peptides.",

It has been recently pro-posed that membrane-targeting virucidal compounds may comprise broad-spectrum inhibitors of enveloped virus entry (10) (11) (12) . Arguably, compounds interfering with fusion by acting on the lipid component of the viral envelope could provide the basis for escape-proof antiviral therapies (13, 14) . In addition, as opposed to host cell membranes that are subject to ongoing synthesis, degradation, and influx and efflux of their components, static viral membranes lacking repairing mechanisms cannot escape the major perturbations induced by virucide activity. In this regard, a series of works support the possibility that peptides derived from hydrophobic-at-interface envelope glycoprotein sequences may comprise new generic antivirals (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Along this same line of thinking, in recent reviews it has been contended that these virucidal peptides could block viral entry by changing directly the physical chemistry of the viral membrane upon partitioning (20, 21) .",

Here, to get new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing antiviral activity by membrane-partitioning peptides, we first compare the inhibitory potencies of several membrane-proximal external region-transmembrane domain (MPER-TMD)-derived peptides that possess distinct interfacial hydrophobicity patterns (20, 24) , and then establish their membrane-restructuring capacities using the VL mixture as a surrogate of the HIV membrane. Our experimental data support a virucide-like activity that alters the physical chemistry of the HIV lipid envelope for peptides combining the hydrophobic-at-interface C-terminal MPER sequence with the N-terminal hydrophobic section of the TMD. We speculate that these sequences may serve as platforms for further development of antiretroviral peptides.",

In brief, HIV-1 pseudoviruses were produced by transfection of human kidney HEK293T cells with the full-length Env clone JRCSF (kindly provided by Jamie K. Scott and Naveed Gulzar, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada) using calcium phosphate. Cells were cotransfected with vectors pWXLP-GFP and pCMV8.91, encoding a GFP and an Env-deficient HIV-1 genome, respectively (provided by Patricia Villace, CSIC, Madrid, Spain). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with Optimem-Glutamax II (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) without serum. Two days after transfection, the pseudovirus particles were harvested, passed through 0.45-mm-pore sterile filters (Millex-HV; Millipore NV, Brussels, Belgium) and finally concentrated by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient. HIV entry was determined using TZM-bl target cells (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, contributed by J. Kappes). HIV pseudoviruses diluted to a 10-15% tissue culture infectious dose in PBS were deposited onto poly-L-lysine-coated 96-well plates, and incubated at 4 C for 40 min. After washing, free poly-lysine was blocked for 20 min by medium addition (90% DMEM; 10% FBS) at 37 C. Several dilutions of a given peptide in PBS were subsequently applied for 90 min at 37 C. After three washing steps, 1. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) made of the VL lipid mixture (POPC/ SPM/CHOL/DHSM/POPE/pl-PE/POPS (14:12:46:5:3:13:7 mol ratio)) were produced following the extrusion method. To that end, lipid suspensions were subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles before extrusion 10 times through two stacked polycarbonate membranes with a nominal pore-size of 0.1 mm (Nucleopore, Pleasanton, CA). Vesicle permeability changes and vesicle-vesicle fusion were determined by the standard assays of ANTS/DPX leakage and Rho-PE/NBD-PE-based lipid mixing, respectively (27) .",

Supporting the biological relevance of these MPER segments, they consecutively span the broadly neutralizing epitopes 2F5 and 4E10 (27, 34, 35) . These interfacial sequences are followed by the TMD (residues 684-704), which is mostly hydrophobic according to the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index (36) .

The sequence range covered by each of the peptides displayed in the panels of Fig. 1 B was thus selected on the basis of the presence of the CRAC motif and the hydrophobicity profiles. The list included a peptide bearing an Ile residue at the position of the absolutely conserved residue Leu-679. The resulting L679I substitution was shown to attenuate interactions of CRAC-representative peptides with Chol and reduce Env fusogenicity (45, 46) . Fig. 1 B compares the antiviral activity of the peptides with the effects exerted on VL LUVs (leakage and fusion). Antiviral activity was evaluated on virions that were first attached to poly-lysine-coated plates (26) (see Fig. S1 A), and cell infectivity subsequently quantified following procedures described in Bobardt et al.

Addition of interfacial hydrophobicity and the CRAC motif at the C terminus to render the peptide MPER(656\u00c0683) did not elicit activity. Thus, it appears that bearing high interfacial hydrophobicity was not sufficient to trigger virucidal activity, even if the peptide contained the CRAC sequence. In contrast, the peptide MPER(671\u00c0693), which combined the C-terminal hydrophobic-at-interface MPER stretch with the N-terminal section of the TMD, induced robust antiviral activity with a mean IC 50 value of 1.67 5 0.04 mM. Interestingly, the peptide MPER(671\u00c0693)L679I with the mutated CRAC motif displayed a comparable virucidal effect (IC 50 value of 0.96 5 0.02 mM). Finally, the TMD(684\u00c0704) sequence representing the full-length gp41 TMD, as defined by Cohen et al. (47), did not have any apparent effect on pseudovirus cell entry.",

Under the assumption that the 679 LWYIK 683 sequence can interact with, and sequester Chol (31, 46) , the effect of depleting this compound from the mixtures was assessed in parallel. GP images of the different VL GUV samples displayed a single macroscopic phase (Fig. 2 A) , which was reflected in a normal, unimodal, distribution of pixel-GP values for every GUV (23) . As expected, decreasing the Chol content resulted in lower mean GP values, consistent with a decrease of the VL membrane order (Fig. 2 B, left panel) . A more subtle reduction of Laurdan GP values was observed for the GUVs treated with peptides MPER(671\u00c0693) and MPER(671\u00c0693)L679I (Fig. 2 B, right panel) .

However, consistently with the smoother contours and larger domain sizes, Dh values were significantly higher in peptide-containing monolayers (Fig. 3 B, right panel) . Thus, inclusion of 1 mol % of peptide induced a more marked effect on lipid miscibility than reducing the Chol content of the mixture by 30 mol %. Together with the fact that the presence of a functional CRAC was not required for inducing the effect, these data clearly indicate that the observed alterations were not the consequence of peptide-induced Chol depletion through the formation of equimolar peptide-Chol complexes.",

In these experiments, peptide and lipids were mixed at defined 1:500 mol ratio before desiccation on the silica beads.

Lipid monolayers containing the inactive peptides displayed distinct nanostructures.

In addition, the Env subunit gp41 is anchored to the HIV membrane through the MPER-TMD region (Env residues 656\u00c0704, HXB2c numbering), which encompasses interfacially active sequences enriched in aromatic residues (24) . To map potential virucidal activity within the MPER-TMD region, in this work we have employed several overlapping peptides, which feature different degrees of interfacial hydrophobicity (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, using the VL surrogate we have comparatively assessed the selected peptides in their capacity for altering membrane stability, as well as for modulating the Chol-dependent lipid packing and liquidliquid miscibility.

We observed that the virucidal peptides MPER(671\u00c0693) and MPER(671\u00c0693)L679I slightly, although significantly, decreased lipid packing of the VL mixture (Fig. 2) .

We approached the effects of the MPER-TMD-derived peptides on lateral segregation using lipid monolayers that were compressed to 10 mN/m, which represents a miscibility transition pressure for the HIV lipids and ternary mixtures containing Chol (23, 56) . This condition was also selected based on previous observations indicating that increasing lateral pressure to 30 mN/m induces collapse of the lipid monolayer made of the viral lipids, whereas its lateral organization, consisting of demixed nanodomains, was preserved at the lower values of 20 and 10 mN/m (23). Thus, AFM analysis of VL lipid monolayers allowed scoring at the nanoscopic length scale the effect of the different peptides on the demixed liquid domain pattern (Figs. 3 and 4) . The topographic information obtained under our experimental conditions confirmed that the active peptide MPER(671\u00c0693) can induce nanodomain clustering. However, a similar effect was observed for the inactive peptides MPER(656\u00c0683) and TMD(684\u00c0704), Thus, the capacity of the peptides to induce nanodomain clustering does not seem to explain the observed virucidal activity.",

In addition, the active peptide induced the highest measured domain height difference after nanodomain clustering (Figs. 4 B and 5 ).

The comparative analysis identifies the two properties of the virucidal sequence that more robustly correlate with its inhibitory activity: the faculty of permeabilizing VL LUVs and its potential to accumulate at the periphery of rigid domains and modulate line tension. Both effects can be interrelated, because accumulation on the edges of lipid domains might help the assembly of the membrane permeating structures inducing vesicle leakage, as previously shown in the case of some pore-forming toxins (57, 58) . The establishment of correlations among interfacial activity, membrane activity, and antiviral activity as a function of the sequence hydrophobicity pattern, might help future development of virucidal peptides.",
