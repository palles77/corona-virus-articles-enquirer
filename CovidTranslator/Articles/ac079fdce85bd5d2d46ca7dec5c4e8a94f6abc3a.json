The objective of our study is to understand the current status of hospitals preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks in Beijing and to provide basic information for infectious disease prevention and control in hospitals. Methods: One hundred fifty-two secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Beijing were surveyed by a standardized questionnaire. Data related to hospital demographic information and their emergency plans, laboratory diagnosis capacity, medical treatment procedures for infectious diseases, stockpiles of drugs and personal protective equipment, and staff training were collected. Results: Responses were received from 134 (88.2%) of the 152 hospitals surveyed. Overall, hospitals reported that the number of physicians and nurses in infectious disease accounted for only 1.8% of the total physicians and 2.5% of the total nurses, and surgery beds accounted for 8.5% of all the fixed beds. Approximately 93.3% of the hospitals surveyed reported that they had an emergency plan, and none of those reported that their laboratories were able to isolate and identify all 8 kinds of common pathogens of infectious diseases: 22.4% of the hospitals had medical treatment procedures for all these infectious diseases, 23.1% had stored specific drugs for treatment, 2.2% had all personal protective equipment, and 30.6% reported that their health care staff had been trained in hospital emergency preparedness for infectious diseases. In general, emergency preparedness for infectious diseases in tertiary care hospitals was better than that in secondary care hospitals; the preparedness at general hospitals was better than that at specialized hospitals; and that at teaching hospitals was better than that at nonteaching hospitals.",

What are some important aspects of hospital preparedness that are likely ignored? To understand the current status of hospital preparedness for infectious diseases in Beijing and to provide basic information for infectious disease prevention and control in hospitals, we surveyed all secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Beijing between November 2004 and March 2005.",

Even in America, hospitals may not have the capacity to deal with a sudden, large increase in the number of patients, as might be seen in a bioterrorist attack. 5 Because precautions avert perils, hospitals should formulate an EP; store staff, beds, and equipment; and educate and train their staff in advance to respond to a large-scale infectious disease outbreak or other public health emergency. 17 Sufficient emergency response personnel and equipment are necessary to respond effectively to a large-scale infectious disease incident. 18 Loutfy et al 6 reported that hospitals' biggest challenge was insufficient personnel in Toronto in the event of SARS. Our study indicates that, during the SARS epidemic, hospitals were short of infectious disease physicians, nurses, and equipment in Beijing.",

One hundred thirty-four respondent hospitals can provide 4700 extra beds, accounting for 8.5% of all fixed beds in Beijing. Xiaotangshan hospital, Beijing Chest hospital, Beijing Ditan hospital, and Beijing You'an hospital were the top 4 hospitals reported that could provide surge beds; the total number was 1582.

However, the accompanied Beijing Health Bureau's official document partially assures that a team approach at each hospital be applied to complete the survey as accurately as possible. The removal of a high-ranking official who hid or distorted information during the SARS crisis has created an environment that encourages hospitals to report information accurately. With a pilot study, return questionnaire review, and follow-up investigation, we do not believe that the respondent reporting bias will have a significant impact on the survey results. Second, our study only included secondary and tertiary care hospitals. Primary care hospitals were not included in this study. Although secondary and tertiary care hospitals are the mainstay for Beijing's infectious diseases prevention and control, primary care hospitals roles in prevention and control infectious diseases should not be ignored. However, based on Beijing's SARS control experience, secondary and tertiary care hospitals' emergency response capacity reflects Beijing's emergency response capacity for infectious diseases. Third, only qualitative data were collected for certain questions such as the status of personal protective equipment and specific drugs stockpiles. The answers to these questions are ''Yes,'' ''No,'' or ''Don't know,'' which limited our ability to quantify hospitals personal protective equipment and specific drugs stockpiles preparedness. Overall, our survey revealed that hospitals emergency preparedness efforts for infectious diseases were in an early stage of development at the time of this survey in Beijing. To enhance preparation for dealing with infectious diseases of public health significance, hospitals should revise/update their EP timely, ie, planning is an ongoing process; hospitals should also have regular staff training and disaster exercises, enhance laboratory diagnostic capability, store appropriate antidotes and antibiotics, have sufficient personal protective equipments and related supplies, and pay close attention to communication and cooperation with other hospitals and public health agencies. In addition, more comprehensive instruments should be used periodically to assess the progress of hospital emergency preparedness.",
