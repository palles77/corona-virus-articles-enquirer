Humoral immunity greatly influences in vivo AAV transduction. However, neutralizing antibodies to AAV-6, 8, and 9 have not been systemically examined in normal and dystrophic dogs. To gain information on the seroprevalence of antibodies to AAV-6, 8, and 9, we measured neutralizing antibody titers using an in vitro transduction inhibition assay. We examined 72 naive serum samples and 26 serum samples obtained from dogs that had received AAV gene transfer. Our data demonstrated that AAV-6 neutralizing antibody was the most prevalent antibody in dogs irrespective of age, gender, disease status (dystrophic or not), and prior parvovirus vaccination history. Surprisingly, high-level anti-AAV-6 antibody was detected at birth in newborn puppies. Further, a robust antibody response was induced in affected, but not normal newborn dogs following systemic AAV gene transfer. Taken together, our data have provided an important baseline on the seroprevalence of AAV-6, 8, and 9 neutralizing antibodies in normal and Duchenne muscular dystrophy dogs. These results will help guide translational AAV gene-therapy studies in dog models of muscular dystrophy.",

            "text": "D uchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked lethal muscle disease caused by dystrophin deficiency. The dystrophin gene is one of the largest genes in the genome. Its 14-kb coding sequence yields a 427-kDa subsarcolemmal cytoskeletal protein called dystrophin. Dystrophin is essential for the survival of striated muscle cells. In the absence of dystrophin, myocytes undergo necrosis and are eventually replaced by noncontractile fibrotic and/or fatty tissues. Highly truncated microdystrophin genes are artificially engineered dystrophin genes. They can fit into the capsid of an adeno-associated virus (AAV), a parvovirus-derived genedelivery vector. Despite significant abbreviation of the coding sequences, microdystrophin genes have been shown to protect skeletal muscle and the heart in mouse DMD models by AAV gene transfer (Wang et al., 2000; Harper et al., 2002; Yue et al., 2003 Yue et al., , 2006 Gregorevic et al., 2006; Bostick et al., 2008) . A critical next step is to determine whether these microgenes are effective in ameliorating muscle disease in the canine DMD model (Duan, 2011) .",

Among these are the viral serotype and preexisting immunity (Gao et al., 2005; Vandenberghe and Wilson, 2007; Zaiss and Muruve, 2008; Mingozzi and High, 2011) . 8, and 9 are currently the most promising AAV serotypes in canine DMD gene-therapy studies (Wang et al., 2007; Yue et al., 2008; Gregorevic et al., 2009; Ohshima et al., 2009) . Unfortunately, humoral responses to these AAV serotypes have not been fully appreciated in dogs (either normal or dystrophic) (Rapti et al., 2011) . To study the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to AAV-6, 8, and 9, we sampled normal, carrier, and affected dogs that were located in two geographically distant institutes (Auburn University, Auburn, AL, and the University of Missouri, Columbia, MO). Age at serum collection ranged from within 24 hr of birth to approximately 3 years. Baseline NAb titers were determined in dogs that had not been exposed to AAV vectors. The influence of dystrophin gene mutation (wild type, carrier, and affected), gender, and prior exposure to parvovirus vaccination were evaluated. In the case of newborn dogs, we also correlated their NAb titers to those of the dam. Further, we studied the NAb changes in neonatal puppies that received systemic AAV infection and in adult dogs that were challenged with intramuscular AAV injection.",

All dogs were produced using artificial insemination. Affected dogs carried one or two of three different mutations in the dystrophin gene. These mutations include the following: (1) a point mutation (an A to G transition) near the end of intron 6 [this mutation disrupts the normal splicing and results in an outof-frame transcript missing exon 7 (Sharp et al., 1992) ; it was originally reported in golden retriever muscular dystrophy dogs]; (2) an insertion of a repetitive element in intron 13 (Smith et al., 2011) (this mutation was originally found in Welsh corgi muscular dystrophy dogs); and (3) an insertion of a repetitive element in intron 19 (Smith et al., 2007; Fine et al., 2011) (this mutation was originally found in Labrador retriever muscular dystrophy dogs). The genotype of each experimental subject was determined by PCR according to our published protocols (Fine et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2011; Yue et al., 2011) .

Prior to the measurement of NAb, serum was heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. The NAb assays were performed on Huh7 cells as previously described, using the same multiplicity of infection (MOI) for all serotypes (Calcedo et al., 2009) . In brief, 10 9 genomic copies of recombinant AAV.CMV.LacZ per well was diluted in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and incubated with twofold serial dilutions (initial dilution, 1:5) of heatinactivated serum samples in DMEM for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, the serum-vector mixture was added to 96-well plates (1 \u00b7 10 5 Huh7 cells/well) that had been infected 2 hr earlier with wild-type human adenovirus serotype-5 (MOI = 45 viral particles/cell). One hour later, each well was supplemented with an equal volume of 20% fetal bovine serum DMEM and incubated for 20-24 hr at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Finally, cells were lysed, and the lysate was developed with a mammalian b-galactosidase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Bioluminescence was quantified using a Clarity software-driven microplate luminometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The NAb titer was reported as the highest serum dilution that inhibited AAV.CMV.LacZ transduction (b-galactosidase expression) of Huh7 cells by 50% or more, compared with naive mouse serum control (S3509; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The limit of detection was 1:5.",

(B) Comparison of seroprevalence to AAV-6, 8, and 9 between male and female dogs. n = 36 for male; n = 36 for female. AAV-6 was originally isolated from an adenovirus stock (Rutledge et al., 1998) . However, it may actually represent a natural recombinant of AAV-1 and 2, because its first 508 nucleotides are identical to AAV-2 and the remaining nucleotides are identical to AAV-1 (Xiao et al., 1999) . AAV-1 and 2 were also isolated from adenovirus stocks (Atchison et al., 1965; Xiao et al., 1999) . AAV-8 and 9 were isolated by PCR from rhesus monkey and human tissues, respectively (Gao et al., 2002 (Gao et al., , 2004 . It is generally accepted that preexisting immunity to a specific AAV serotype is due to previous ex-posure to the same serotype during natural infection. The low incidence of AAV-8 and AAV-9 NAbs is consistent with this model. The high level of the seropositivity to AAV-6 is, however, unexpected. Although we cannot completely exclude nonimmunoglobulin inhibitory factors, a recent study by Rapti and co-workers revealed a trend similar to what we have observed here (Rapti et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "A surprising finding is the high AAV-6 NAb titer in newborn puppies (Fig. 3) . Dogs are multiparous animals. The structure of their placentas is different from that of humans. In essence, maternal and fetal blood are separated in dogs, and there is minimal transfer of maternal antibody to the fetus through the placenta (Felsburg, 2002; Day, 2007) . Newborn dogs obtain passive immunity primarily from colostrum, which is highly enriched with immunoglobulins (Reynolds and Johnson, 1970; Heddle and Rowley, 1975; Korhonen et al., 2000; Schafer-Somi et al., 2005) . Importantly, the newborn puppy digestive tract is specially adapted for immunoglobulin absorption via the FcRn receptor (Felsburg, 2002; Day, 2007) . It has been suggested that the levels of puppy serum IgG may reach that of dam via suckling colostrum (Felsburg, 1998) . Because of the universal presence of the AAV-6 NAb in dogs (Figs. 1 and 2, and Supp Fig. 1) , it is reasonable to assume that the AAV-6 NAb in puppy was transferred from the dam through colostrum. However, this cannot completely explain our observation, because we found that neonates showed a significantly higher AAV-6 NAb titer than that of dam. Another peculiar finding from our study is the reduction of the AAV-6 NAb after parvovirus vaccine immunization ( Fig. 2A) . It is worth pointing out that vaccinated dogs were significantly older than prevaccinated dogs ( > 2 months versus < 2 months). In this regard, we cannot exclude the age effect. Further in-depth investigations are needed to clarify these provoking observations.",

Despite this immune maturity, interestingly, intravenous AAV administration did not induce a noticeable B-cell response in normal puppies. The composition of peripheral lymphocytes is different between neonates and adults. The newborn puppy thymus contains much fewer T cells (absolute number) (for reviews, see Felsburg, 1998 Felsburg, , 2002 Day, 2007) . It is yet to be demonstrated whether these differences have contributed to the lack of the humoral response in normal puppies.",

One factor worth considering is the passive immunity obtained from colostrum (Felsburg, 1998) . A significant difference between newborn normal and affected puppies is their suckling ability. Dystrophin-null dogs are usually much weaker Duan, Shin, and Yue, unpublished observations) . We suspect that affected puppies may fail to compete for colostrum with normal/carrier siblings. This may result in hypogammaglobulinemia. Reduced maternal protection may thus contribute to the high humoral response in dystrophindeficient puppies. In support of this notion, it has been shown that a phage antigen induces an antibody response in newborn puppies only when they are deprived of colostrum (Felsburg, 1998 (Felsburg, , 2002 . Additional studies with colostrum (or colostrum substitutes) supplementation may further test our hypothesis (Poffenbarger et al., 1991; Bouchard et al., 1992) . Adult dogs showed expected responses to local AAV injection (Fig. 5) . Nevertheless, it appears that transient immune suppression may greatly blunt the humoral response in adult dogs (Wang et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2011) .",
