            "text": "Poyang Lake is situated within the East Asian Flyway, a migratory corridor for waterfowl that also encompasses Guangdong Province, China, the epicenter of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1. The lake is the largest freshwater body in China and a significant congregation site for waterfowl; however, surrounding rice fields and poultry grazing have created an overlap with wild waterbirds, a situation conducive to avian influenza transmission. Reports of HPAI H5N1 in healthy wild ducks at Poyang Lake have raised concerns about the potential of resilient freeranging birds to disseminate the virus. Yet the role wild ducks play in connecting regions of HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Asia is hindered by a lack of information about their migratory ecology. During 2007-08 we marked wild ducks at Poyang Lake with satellite transmitters to examine the location and timing of spring migration and identify any spatiotemporal relationship with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks. Species included the Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), northern pintail (Anas acuta), K",

Both Mukhtar et al. and Chen et al. have implicated wild waterfowl at Poyang Lake in HPAI H5N1 transmission, and both proposed a possible link to Qinghai Lake, where the largest recorded wild bird epizootic occurred in 2005 (6, 29) . However, little empirical information was available at that time on the migratory movements of wild ducks from the Poyang and Qinghai regions to ecologically establish an association with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks.",

The infection status of birds marked at the onset of the project in March 2007 was diagnosed using both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serological testing. We used telemetry locations to develop movement models and utilization distributions of the East Asian Flyway migration routes. We compared these migratory pathways with regional HPAI H5N1 outbreaks reported from this region in poultry and wild birds to determine if there were spatial relationships between wild duck movements and outbreak areas. Finally, we examined relationships between the timing of outbreaks and wild duck life-cycle stages to see if they were correlated.",

Poyang Lake is fed by the Gan and Xiu rivers, and its shallow basin is connected to the Yangtze River. The lake is part of a large alluvial floodplain with seasonal rainfall (between May and September) that expands its area to about 4000 km 2 (38) . Severe flooding has been common since 1950s because of land reclamation, levee construction, and El Ni\u00f1o events (38) . The surrounding land use is dominated by rice agriculture, as Poyang Lake is in the center of China's rice production region. The lake basin also supports a rich benthic community of at least 58 invertebrate taxa, which exceeds resources available to waterfowl in the adjacent river systems (41) . Satellite telemetry locations for ducks marked at Poyang Lake were used to describe the spring migration range of waterfowl in the East Asian Flyway, extending northward from Poyang Lake to northeast China and southeastern Siberia.",

We averaged the three BBUD isopleths for falcated teal, common and other small teal, and Eurasian wigeon to describe the East Asian Flyway pathway for wild ducks from Poyang Lake (Fig. 4) . Although the migratory corridor extended east to west across most of the Bohai Bay, there was a stopover region used by most ducks in China just north of Bohai Bay. We overlaid the overall BBUD migration pathway on a grid of poultry density and plotted the documented outbreak locations. The AIC analysis indicated that two models fit the data (Table 3) : these included the top-ranked model with covariates latitude+poultry density, and the second-ranked model with latitude+poultry density +BBUD. However, a comparative examination of each covariate's contribution to the model (Table 4 ) indicated that BBUD magnitude was only weakly and inversely related to the outbreak location (i.e., fewer wild bird locations where there were more outbreaks). Thus, we concluded that the top AIC ranked model (latitude+poultry density) was the single most parsimonious model in explaining variation in spatial outbreak locations.",

Prior to our satellite telemetry studies, little data were available on migratory movements of wild birds during the nonbreeding season at Poyang Lake, a region that has been suggested as an important source of HPAI H5N1 (6, 30) . Because sample size in satellite telemetry projects is limited by the cost of the technology along with battery life and performance, it is often difficult to generalize the sequential movements of individuals to broader migratory patterns of populations. However, application of the recently developed Brownian bridge movement model (21) allowed us to describe the flyway migration corridor in a probabilistic manner. As waterfowl demonstrate a high degree of seasonal fidelity to sites within and between years (1), we believe our BBUD analysis of spring 2007 migration tracks provided a reliable representation of the general migration route for the East Asian Flyway.",

However, this type of spatial analysis depends on complete or representative reporting of outbreaks. If outbreaks are not fully reported, it could result in erroneous conclusions (22, 23) . Thus, our analysis highlights the importance of transparency in outbreak reporting to better understand the spread of disease. In addition, our analyses would have been improved with larger samples of the different species.

The relationship of outbreaks with latitude ( Fig. 6 ) could stem from the higher density of poultry farms in southern, compared to northern China.

Similar to earlier studies of whooper swans in the East Asian Flyway (26), we found fewer outbreaks than expected during the breeding season, when AIV prevalence typically reaches a maximum in wild bird populations (37) . Instead, the peak in observed outbreaks coincided with the nonbreeding season of migratory birds. During the breeding season, birds migrate to latitudes higher than 40\u00b0N (Fig. 6 ), precluding contact with poultry farms. However, the possibility exists that persistence of AIV H5 subtype particles in the environment (2) may be responsible for the lag between the breeding season and the peak in infections two months later. Our data also indicate that migration between nonbreeding and breeding areas is prolonged, with many intervening stopover sites. If AIV particles survive in the environment with increased residence time in colder climates (2) , wild birds may act as agents of transmission, \"seeding\" areas along their migration routes such as rice fields. Larger waterfowl such as geese may defecate as often as every 3.7 minutes (47) and therefore if infected have the potential to contaminate the environment with high loads of virus. Some duck species, such as the mallard, may shed virus for several days before the onset of clinical signs (25) , a period of time in which they could potentially travel several hundred kilometers assuming that the infection did not affect their movements (40) . Opportunities for poultry to acquire AIV shed by wild birds at Poyang Lake are created by the practice of herding domestic ducks onto the harvested rice fields to consume waste grains, as well as foraging in wetlands frequented by migratory birds.",

This area may represent a migratory \"thoroughfare\" of regional importance for several species of waterbirds such as whooper swans (32) , bar-tailed godwits (Limosa limosa) (15, 35) , and swan geese (author's unpublished data). Studies have identified sites that attract a diversity of wild bird species as important for interspecific transmission of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (7, 17, 18) . Similarly, the convergence of numerous waterbird species from different flyways at Bohai Bay may facilitate exchange of AIVs of different geographic origin. Regional migration stopover sites where wild bird species congregate and intermix are commonplace along other flyways, such as Qinghai Lake in the Central Asian Flyway. These high-density regional stopover areas may serve as catalysts for spread of disease in wild birds (27) , just as live poultry or \"wet\" markets facilitate transmission by bringing together multiple species of domestic fowl drawn from populations of different geographic regions (5, 42) .",

In addition to the tracking data for eight species of migratory ducks from Poyang Lake, this included two species (bar-headed geese, ruddy shelduck) involved in the large 2005 outbreak at Qinghai Lake (6, 29) . Although most waterbirds migrate in a north-south direction, migration of some species may be east-west such as pochards (Aythya ferina) (1) and whooper swans (32) . It is possible that a larger sample of more species would result in detection of a migratory pathway connecting the East and Central Asian Flyways, but our tracking results to date indicate that, at best, it is not a commonly used route by waterfowl. Alternative possibilities for the movement of HPAI H5N1 from Poyang Lake to Qinghai Lake include that other species may follow that migration route, some species overlap at staging areas such as Dong Ting Lake to the west or Bohai Bay to the north and serve as relay agents, or migration routes from other regions might be involved. For example, our telemetry work in the Central Asian Flyway documented a previously unknown migration route connecting Qinghai Lake to a 2005 outbreak site in Mongolia (34) . Another alternative explanation is the trade of poultry or poultry products between these two wetlands. However, because poultry production is largely absent in this migration corridor and we found no connection between the flyways, the movement of HPAI H5N1 from the Poyang Lake and Qinghai Lake regions remains a mystery.
