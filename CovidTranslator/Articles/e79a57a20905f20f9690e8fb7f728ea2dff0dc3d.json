In SWCNTs, a single graphene sheet is folded to form a cylindrical closed structure, whereas in case of MWCNTs, around 3\u00c05 sheets of single-walled nanotubes are rolled upon each other to form a multilayered structure. In addition, the SWCNTs may further be categorized based on the differences in the arrangements of their carbon atoms. The armchair arrangement is typically characterized by the chairs perpendicular to the tube axis, whereas a V-shape perpendicular to the tube axis is characteristic of the zigzag arrangement. The unique electrical, conductive properties and metallic characteristics are primarily determined by their degree of chirality. This forms the basis of designing a variety of nanoelectronic and diagnostic instruments (Tessonnier and Su, 2011) . Beside structural differences, the CNTs also differ from each other dimensionally. A coaxial structure, containing two concentric graphene cylinders with higher thermal and chemical stability than single-walled nanotubes has been explored recently. These are termed double-walled CNTs. Apart from this, several variants in CNT shapes have been seen including carbon nanohorns (CNHs), nanobuds, and nanotorus, which have enormous applications in drug delivery due to the suitability of their characteristic modified structure. Figure 15 .1 diagrammatically depicts the various types of CNTs employed in drug delivery.",

In this manner, CNTs act as nanoreservoirs to adsorb the drug molecules by host\u00c0guest interaction. Forces that govern such adsorption are the hydrophobic and \u03c0\u00c0\u03c0 stacking interactions between the chains of the adsorbed molecules and the surfaces of CNTs. In the case of lipophilic drug moieties, the hydrophobic forces are the main driving forces for the loading of such drugs into or onto CNTs. The presence of charge on the nanotube surface due to chemical treatment can enable the adsorption of the charged molecules through ionic interactions (Liu et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2002) . Noncovalent functionalization of CNTs is particularly attractive as it offers the possibility of attaching chemical modifications without affecting the electronic network of the tubes. Such functionalization can be achieved simply by exposing the CNTs to vapors containing functionalization species that noncovalently bond to the nanotube surface. Using this functionalization process, surfactants, polymers, and biomolecules like DNA, siRNA, proteins, and peptides can be successfully loaded onto the surfaces of CNTs (Figure 15 .5). ",

In order to achieve such functionalization, CNTs can be oxidized using strong acids, resulting in the reduction of their length while generating carboxylic groups, thus increasing their dispersibility in aqueous solutions. Alternatively, addition reactions of hydrophilic groups to the CNTs external walls and tips can also make them soluble in water. To achieve such a type of functionalization with therapeutic molecules like methotrexate, chemical reactions like 1,3-cycloaddition can be employed. Complete control over such chemo-or region-selective additions, however, is somewhat tricky to achieve, as it involves particular groups such as cyclic compounds, halogens, arynes, or carbenes. Moreover, such reactions often require extreme conditions for covalent bonding. Further, characterization of such functionalized nanotubes to determine the precise functionalization location and mode of addition are also very difficult. It may broadly be classified as end-defect functionalization or side-wall functionalization. End-defect functionalization involves oxidation at the \"end\" tips, whereas covalent binding of surfactants, proteins, and peptides on the surface of CNTs is referred to as side-wall functionalization.

Monoclonal antibody-functionalized SWCNTs have been employed for tumor targeting and for diagnostic imaging. An important prerequisite is the compatibility of the CNTs with the targeting antibodies as well as nanotubes. Also, the antigenicity of antibodies must remain unaltered after their attachment to the nanotubes and subsequently to their desired site of action. In addition, this approach can be employed for the delivery of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. One of the functionalization techniques, that is, PEGylation, has recently gained immense importance owing to its enhanced biocompatibility, solubility, and reduced toxicity (Bottini et al., 2011) .

Because of their chemical and mechanical stability, incorporation, and controlled drug release, these CNTs can be chemically modified to achieve the desired targeting effect. In addition, Yang et al.

It has also been observed that when single-stranded DNA is bound to SWCNTs, DNA probes are protected from enzymatic cleavage and interference from nucleic-acid-binding proteins. Studies have shown that an SWCNT-modified DNA probe can target a specific mRNA inside living cells, thus causing increased self-delivery capability and intracellular biostability, compared with free DNA probes. In contrast to the traditional methods available for gene delivery, CNTs provide distinct advantages like enhanced capability to penetrate into the cells owing to their needle-like shape, hydrophobic surface, and their electrical properties. In addition, their capacity to achieve controlled release, influence on transitions of DNA/siRNA, and ability to monitor the therapeutic effects provides this conjugate with great potential for applications in the field of genetic engineering (Cheung et al., 2010) .",

Conjugation of AmB to these f-CNTs has been shown to have reduced toxicity and enhanced antimycotic efficiency. In addition, their targeted deliveries to macrophage cells have also been indicated by researchers. Furthermore, CNTs themselves might possess antimicrobial activity as bacteria, such as Escherichia coli may be absorbed onto the surface of the CNTs. The CNT might induce oxidation of the intercellular oxidant glutathione, resulting in increased oxidative stress on the bacterial cells and thus eventual cell death.",

            "text": "In comparison to bulk materials, nanotubes have unique properties including an exponentially high aspect ratio that leads to toxicity. Reduction of size consequently makes the nanomaterial surface more reactive on itself (i.e., aggregation) and its surrounding environment (i.e., biological components). Accumulation of nanosized material may also cause increased uptake into tissues, thus influencing the critical biological function of cells. Besides, metal traces available in nanotubes are also another causative agent for toxicity (Beg et al., 2011) . Exposure to CNTs causes multifunctional defects in various body organs and organ systems. Early systemic exposure of MWCNTs causes temporary organ injury, particularly to lungs and heart, attributable largely to their delayed clearance from the body due to strong agglomeration. Persistent accumulation of agglomerated MWCNTs in the lungs initiates inflammatory events (Takagi et al., 2008) . Similarly, SWCNTs have been found to affect the CNS due to a high degree of accumulation in the spinal cord or dorsal root ganglia. Furthermore, SWCNTs significantly decrease the DNA content when the cells were exposed to disperse SWCNT bundles due to their accumulation in the nuclear material. Also, exposure to SWCNTs has resulted in ultrastructural and morphological changes in cultured skin cells (Yacobi et al., 2007) . Comparative evaluation of toxicity studies has revealed that MWCNTs are more toxic as compared to SWCNTs, and induce massive loss of cell viability through programmed cell death. This toxicity of MWCNTs is primarily due to oxidative stress, cellular toxicity due to formation of free radicals, accumulation of peroxidative products, antioxidant depletion, and loss of cell viability as depicted in Figure 15 .9. CNTs also exhibit primary genotoxicity due to the direct interaction of particles with cells, or secondary genotoxicity due to the generation of an excess of ROS. MWCNTs have genotoxicity effects due to DNA damage through ROS, leading to increased mutation frequencies (Sargent et al., 2010) .",

Similarly, the UK Government has committed toward EHS research, primarily with new studies on safety issues of specific nanomaterials, in particular nanosilver and CNTs with the Unites States as UK2, UK3, UK4, and OECD1. Of late, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of United States has issued certain regulations for CNTs and other nanomaterials.
