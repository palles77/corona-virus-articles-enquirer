In this study, we employed a DNA vaccine technology with the levamisole, our newly discovered chemical adjuvant, to generate Th1 type of response. To avoid the enhancement antibody issue, genes encoding the nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope protein of SARS-CoV were cloned and their expressions in mammalian cells were determined. After the intramuscular introduction into animals, we observed that the constructs of the E, M, and N genes could induce high levels of specific antibodies, T cell proliferations, IFN-c, DTH responses, and in vivo cytotoxic T cells activities specifically against SARS-CoV antigens. The highest immune responses were generated by the construct encoding the nucleocapsid protein. The results suggest that the N, M, and E genes could be used as the targets to prevent SARS-CoV infection in the DNA vaccine development.",

The genome of SARS-CoV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA including a 5 0 -cap and a 3 0 -polyadenylation structure, and encodes five major proteins typical of coronaviruses including the replicate polyproteins, the spike protein (S), the envelope protein (E), the membrane glycoprotein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). To develop a safe and yet effective SARS vaccine is a new challenge for laboratories in the world. Spike protein has been indicated as the key protein to interact with the cell receptor in coronaviral family including the SARS-CoV [1] . Immunization with the spike protein or killed viral vaccine induces an enhancement antibody which accelerates subsequent infection of the feline coronavirus [2, 3] . It suggests that the spike protein may not be a good candidate antigen used as vaccine development.",

All DNA vaccine constructs, encoding the E protein, the M glycoprotein, and the N protein of SARS-CoV, were obtained as follows: these genes were amplified from the cDNA by PCR amplifications using each set of specific primers, respectively. For the N gene, the upstream primer is 5 0 -AA-GAATTCGCCATGTCTGATAATGGACCC-3 0 and the downstream one is 5 0 -AAGAATTCGTTTATGCCTGAGTTG AATC-3 0 ; for the M gene, the upstream primer is 5 0 -AA GAATTCGCCATGGCA GACAACGGTACTAT-3 0 and the downstream one is 5 0 -AATCT AGATTACTGTACTAGCAAAGCAAT AT-3 0 ; and for the E gene, the upstream primer is 5 0 -AA GAATTCGCCATGTACTCATT CGTTTCG-3 0 and the downstream one is 5 0 -AATCTAGATTA GACCAGAAGATCAG-3 0 . To express the three genes in eukaryotic cells, the sequences containing an ATG start codon and a Kozak consensus sequence, GCC, were incorporated into 5 0 end of each upstream primer. A restriction digestion site was also incorporated into each primer indicated as underlined. All the amplified products were first cloned into pDM18-T vectors and confirmed by the sequence analysis, respectively. The three products were, respectively, subcloned into appropriate sites of pcD3d, a 3.4 kb eukaryotic expression vector derived from the pcD3d vector (Invitrogen) by a deletion of the regions for the SV40 promoter, neomycin ORF, and SV40 poly(A). The final products were designated as the pcD3d/E, pcD3d/M, and pcD3d/N, respectively. All three DNA vaccines were transformed into the Esch-erichia coli strain Top10 (Invitrogen), extracted and purified by PEG8000 precipitation [16] . The final products were dissolved by saline solution and stored at 4\u00b0C until immunization.",

The mean titers with standard deviation (SD) of antibodies in five animals against CoV were evaluated by ELISA with 2 lg/ml of chemically killed SARS-CoV as antigen coated on each well in a 96-well plate and by using an absolute ratio of Post/Na\u00efve serum at a cutoff of 2.1. *Indicates values that are statistically significant at a p value <0.05 by Student\u00d5s t test compared with the group of control vector.

As depicted in Fig. 5 , it shows that the highest levels of mRNAs for IL-2 and IFN-c were induced in the group immunized with the pcD3d/N construct, which suggests that the Th1 polarized response, followed by the groups immunized with the pcD3d/M and pcD3d/E constructs. For the Th2 cytokines, IL-4 mRNA expressions were observed after immunizations with N and M DNA vaccines. No IL-10 expression was observed, except in the group injected with M gene construct.",

It induces immune responses to, and in some cases even leads to, the protection against various types of infection, such as influenza, malaria, and SARS [22] [23] [24] . A common feature of the DNA vaccination is that the synthesis of the antigen occurs in intracellular compartments, allowing the processed antigen to enter the MHC class I pathway [25] , in turn to generate CD8 + CTL activities. In this report, we demonstrated that both humoral-and cellular-mediated specific responses could be induced by DNA constructs encoding N, M, and E antigens against the SARS-CoV. All three DNA constructs induced SARS-CoV-specific antibodies in mice and the pcD3d/N group showed the highest titer of antibodies (1:4800), followed by the pcD3d/M group (1:3200) and the pcD3d/E group (1:2400) (Fig. 2) . In addition, the T cell proliferation and DTH responses were also successfully induced in mice after vaccinations with these constructs (Fig. 3 and Table 1 ). These results suggested that the DNA vaccine was effective to prime a specific anti-SARS-CoV response to and apparently generate a broad range of both T-helper and B-cell memory during the priming. This was also consistent with previous observation of the protective immunity [26, 27] . Furthermore, the administration with DNAs generated a lower level of IL-10 ( Fig. 5 ), suggesting that a locomotor\u00d5s role of DNA initiated Th1 polarized immunity.",

            "text": "For vaccine design, much attention has been focused on the induction of T cell responses especially of the antigen-specific CTL. Several studies have found that the nucleocapsid protein could induce CTL responses in the cases of the human Hantaan virus [28] , the lethal coronavirus peritonitis virus [29] , and SHIV-1 [30] . Recently, Zhu et al. [31] have found that a DNA construct based on the pcD3d vector could successfully induce SARS-CoV N protein-specific immune responses in a manner of inducing high antibody titers and CTL responses. Kim [32] has demonstrated that the vaccination with N DNA vaccine could successfully induce a SARS-CoV antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response and distinctly reduce the titer of recombinant vaccinia virus expressing SARS-CoV N protein after the challenge and that the co-expression of calreticulin (CRT), a 46 kDa Ca 2+ -binding protein, with N gene could enhance its ability to protect against viral challenges. In the present study, it was consistent with their work that the N protein construct could induce the highest SARS-specific IgG, T cell proliferation, and in vivo CTL response (lysis rate of 50.6%) compared with M protein gene (lysis rate of 17%) and E protein gene (lysis rate of 5.6%) (Fig. 4) . Furthermore, the highest Th1 type response based on expressions of the IFN-c and IL-2 was also induced by N protein. However, the higher level of immune responses generated by the pcD3d/N vaccine may be due to more epitopes in the N nucleocapsid protein since it contains 422 amino acid residues, while the M protein has 220 amino acids; and the E has 76 amino acids. In addition, the differential concentrations of each antigen presented in the killed SARS-CoV preparation could have also contributed to the differences.",
