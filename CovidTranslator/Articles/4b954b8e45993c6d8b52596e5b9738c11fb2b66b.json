For scientists, genome patents blur the supposed line between research and its applications, with implications for how research is financed and data shared. For social scientists, the interactions between genomics and the patent system are of great interest for understanding how society might benefit from the genomics revolution and how commercial interests might shape the future development of this science.

The patents for Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma genitalium were first filed as claim-specific genome patent applications, but during examination, their potentially far-reaching claims were restricted to specific ORFs. This restriction was probably the result of objections by USPTO examiners. The specifications of these patents, which do not normally change after filing, still persistently refer to the whole-genome sequence (and any sequence that is 99.9% similar) as comprising or providing the basis of the invention. Likewise, in the Methanococcus jannaschii patent, the summary of the invention begins with the whole-genome sequence, after which the invention is further directed to the ORFs in the claims. The claims of the two virus genome patents in this category genomic fragments but embed these claims in a broader argument that the whole genome constitutes a useful invention (TABLE 2) .

The first category of genome patents, claim-specific whole-genome patents, places the whole sequence of a specified genome in the claims section as the primary invention. For example, the patent for bacteriophage RM378 claims the isolated and sequenced genome of the phage, as well as any recombinantly produced DNA. Although the Buchnera sp. strain APS patent has only one claim -the isolated genome as represented by its sequence description -the other claim-specific genome patents extend their claims to cDNA, proteins, vectors and host cells (as would most patents for DNA fragments). Utilities for genome patents in this category range from disease diagnosis and therapy to the development of thermostable enzymes and pesticides (TABLE 1) . Although these utilities are often elaborated in relation to particular DNA fragments or encoded polypeptides (for example, non-A non-B hepatitis virus (NANB) in TABLE 1), the descriptions of the inventions avoid excluding other genomic fragments from the overall invention by regularly invoking the rest of the genome. Arguments are also made for the application. If, for example, a group of DNA fragments or sequences can be linked together by an overarching concept, they can then be covered by one patent. It seems reasonable to think of the genome as a concept with the potential for serving that unifying function, and patent documents provide a good basis for examining the extent to which this suggestion is supported in patent practice.",

In these cases, it seems that the DNA and its potential uses are called on to reinforce the organism patent and expand the protection it provides.

            "text": "But what is the difference between wholegenome patents and patents that have been issued on whole microorganisms? Not surprisingly, the utility arguments made for microorganism patents [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] are generally similar to those for genome patents (TABLES 1,2). Microorganism patents for Archaea, for example, argue for uilities that are related to enzyme production in harsh environmental conditions, and bacteria patents claim applications that range from human health to BIOREMEDIATION. However, novelty is established in subtly different ways. Organism patents are based on previously unknown organisms that might have been isolated in unusual circumstances, whereas genome applications for the SARS genome provoked worries that a privately held patent would function as a gatekeeper to all SARS-related research and inhibit drug development. It is likely that similar fears would arise with any increase in the numbers and awareness of issued genome patents. Although empirical work on the impact of conventional DNA patents shows that they do not always have negative effects on research access 27,28 , informational patents could be much more restrictive 23 . Anticipations of genome patenting could extend to questions about whether prokaryotic genome patents set precedents for eukaryotic genome patents (our nonexhaustive search found none of these, nor did we find any in a search of pending whole-genome patent applications). We see two general factors that inhibit this potential trend: tradition and genomic organization. As we noted earlier, prokaryotic microorganism patenting is well established, but unmodified multicellular organisms are far less commonly the objects of patents. We believe that resistance to the patenting of 'higher life forms' -including genetically modified ones such as the ONCOMOUSE -is likely to similarly discourage patenting the genomes of these organisms. At the human level, ethical arguments have been made stating that patenting a whole human genome violates the integrity of an individual in a way that patenting parts of the genome does not 29 . Differences between the USPTO and other patent offices on the patentability of life forms 30 will no doubt continue to be reflected in the international treatment of future whole-genome applications.",

Because the validity of genome patents has yet to be tested in court, the extent to which they will restrict research on the patented genomes is still only a matter for informed speculation. Patent patents take one step towards answering this question. Most of these reports agree that a genome sequence is novel even when parts of the genome have already been sequenced, although some dispute the novelty of newly sequenced genomes from closely related strains. One examiner, for example, objects that a submitted genome sequence (Chlamydia pneumoniae) is merely a definition of a particular strain from the many isolates available, thereby questioning the patentability of genomic variation. In another case (Influenza A), the report notes that the identified genes are well known from other related strains and that their presence should therefore be expected. Both these reports also argue that the sequencing of a genome is routine and does not in itself entail an inventive step.",

According to the examiners' comments, the application examples of Influenza A and C. pneumoniae do not constitute a unified invention that would meet EPO standards. Our initial hypothesis that the idea of a genome is sufficient to unite several genes and their functions into one invention is not, therefore, supported by these examples. A genome, at least in these cases, does not have the taken-for-granted unifying capacity of an organism: it is seen as merely a collection of fragments of DNA.",

Existing whole-genome patents not only settle for simple measures of genomic relatedness, but do so inconsistently. Some use sequence differences between strains as the basis of their genome-patent claim (for example, MCDV-Tn), whereas others discount such variations between strains by arguing that the patent covers other sequences within a certain range of similarity (for example, M. genitalium, H. influenzae and HEV).
