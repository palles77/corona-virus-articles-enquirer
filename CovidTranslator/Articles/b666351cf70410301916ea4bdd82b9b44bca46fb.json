However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

            "text": "During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infections in travellers have been used to estimate the size of the epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which was the epicentre of the outbreak. 1 This approach is similar to that used for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, for which infections in tourists returning from Mexico were used to estimate the time-specific risk of infection (incidence or cumulative incidence) with the novel pandemic H1N1 influenza strain in Mexico (or parts thereof). The idea was that surveillance for H1N1 influenza virus was not intense during the early days of the pandemic in Mexico, the source location, and that detection would be far more sensitive in travellers leaving Mexico, who would be screened when returning home as a means of preventing introductions of cases into destination locations. 2, 3 Reports that health systems in Wuhan were overwhelmed, and that many cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were not being counted, led to the use of outgoing traveller data to estimate the time-specific risk of COVID-19 in Wuhan. 1 This estimate, in turn, has been used to estimate the cumulative incidence of infection by a specific date in Wuhan and, from there (typically assuming exponential growth and no appreciable depletion of susceptible people), the cumulative number of cases. Two important assumptions underlie this calculation. First, it assumes that detection of cases in the destination location has been 100% sensitive and specific, whether cases are detected at the airport (with symptoms) or later after arrival at their destination (incubating during travel). Second, it assumes that travellers have the same prevalence of infection as does the average resident of Wuhan, so the prevalence inferred in travellers can be directly applied in Wuhan. Here, we consider the extent to which these two assumptions are justified and the expected effects they will have on our understanding of the current outbreak of COVID-19.",

Among destinations with substantial travel volume, Singapore showed the highest ratio of detected imported cases to daily travel volume, a ratio of 1\u00b70 cumulative case count per 10\u00b73 daily travellers. Singapore is known for exceptionally sensitive detection of cases (eg, during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]) 5 and has had very detailed case-reporting during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, to test the first assumption, that case-detection has been 100% sensitive, we use Singapore as an example location with very strong case-detection capacity, and we estimate the capacities of other locations relative to Singapore.",

Many estimates in 2019-20 for COVID-19 have, instead, made the assumption of equal prevalence in travellers leaving Wuhan and in residents, which is equivalent to assuming that either all travellers are Wuhan residents or (if travellers are a mix of residents and visitors) all visitors had stayed long enough during the epidemic that their prevalence was similar to that of residents.",

Although we know of no reason to doubt specificity of detection, we tested the assumption of 100% sensitivity. Based on findings of our previous study, 4 we assumed Singapore has the highest capacity for surveillance with respect to COVID-19. We regressed cumulative cases against Wuhan-to-location air travel volume, considering Singapore to have the greatest detection capacity, and estimating relative underdetection compared with Singapore in remaining locations (classified according to the GHS 2 index). Although it is unlikely that the GHS 2 index reflects the true ranking of locations for any specific epidemic, we assume that it can capture roughly different levels of surveillance capacity. We, therefore, grouped locations (apart from Singapore) into three classes of surveillance capacity (high, medium, and low) instead of using exact ranking. Although possibly important for detection, our model does not account for differences in typical flight duration to different destinations.",

If the model is correct, this is a lower bound on the frequency of undetected cases for two reasons. First, Singapore's detection capacity is probably not 100% efficient. Singapore had, as of Feb 12, 2020, eight documented cases of COVID-19 transmission, for which there were no known epidemiological links to China or other known cases, 10 implying that imported cases in Singapore could have gone undetected (although it is not certain that these imports came from Wuhan or elsewhere in China, and links might still be found). Second, Singapore's detection capacity, similar to that in other locations, has relied largely on symptoms and travel history, so the number of asymptomatic or low-severity cases missed by such a strategy is unknown. The second assumption we tested is that the true prevalence in visitors to the epicentre is similar to that of residents: it might be different for either of two reasons. First, the true prevalence could be less if people who visit are less well integrated into the social mixing that produces infection (eg, if they have stayed in specific parts of the city or in hotels), or it could be more if travellers are engaging more intensely in relevant social mixing (eg, through welcoming ceremonies). This aspect could, therefore, increase or decrease prevalence in visitors relative to residents (appendix p 3). In our study, we focused on quantifying a second difference, which is that some visitors will have been in the city only for a short time and, thus, have had less exposure to the infection than residents. We find this effect is most pronounced when the epidemic is growing slowly, when visitors have stayed only briefly, and when the duration of detectable infection is short. We found that for plausible parameters for COVID-19, prevalence in visitors staying only 3 days could be as little as half that of residents, but for longer stays of more than a week the visitor prevalence should be 80% or more that of residents (figure 2). Assuming the population of travellers out of Wuhan is a mix of visitors of various durations and residents, this finding suggests that underestimation of source population prevalence because of the presence of short-stay visitors could be appreciable but more modest than the effect of imperfect detection. For example, in combination with our estimates of underdetection, the total under estimation of cases in Wuhan from only studying visitors could be around 70% for 7-day visits, 5-day doubling time, and 11 days of detectable infection or, with a 3-day visit, as much as 81%. The infection exposure of visitors in high-risk venues (eg, aeroplanes or airport toilets) could be important, and additional variation in exposure between travellers of differ ent international destinations due to, for example, different dominant types of reasons for travel (eg, group holidays vs business trips). Based on our model, the risk of undetected importation and subsequent circulation correlates with air travel connectivity. Indeed, at the time of writing (March 9, 2020), nine locations have reported more than 500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, and the USA), suggesting local transmission. All locations (apart from Iran) are among the 27 most connected locations to Wuhan through air travel, 7 which supports the important role of undetected importation through air travellers (the probability of drawing uniformly at random eight or more highly connected locations to Wuhan under the null assumption that draws are independent of flight connection is <0\u00b7001). However, as new COVID-19 epicentres evolve, the role of air travel from China in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is expected to decline. Finally, our model predicts that locations with high connectivity to Wuhan paired with a relatively low surveillance capacity (eg, India, Maldives, New Zealand, Pakistan, Russia, Sri Lanka, and United Arab Emirates) are probably underdetecting imp orted cases and potentially also self-sustained transmission. Our finding that imported cases detected among travellers probably under-represents the source popu lation prevalence has two important implications for the public health response to COVID-19. First, this finding has implications for approaches to case burden and severity estimation that use cases in travellers to impute cases in Wuhan, which are then compared (for severity estimation) against deaths in Wuhan. If the true number of imported cases is underestimated, then there are more cases in Wuhan and a larger denominator, resulting in reduced estimates of severity compared with severity estimates assuming 100% detection in travellers. 11 Future studies should account for our evolving under standing of detection capacity when estimating case numbers and severity in source population on the basis of traveller case numbers. Second, our model predicts the scenario in which the virus has been imported from Wuhan and remained partly undetected in nearly all locations. An important corollary of this possibility is that, despite large efforts to detect and stop the virus from entering new locations, many undetected imported cases can occur and cause hidden local transmission until a sizable number of cases accumulates, leading to inter national spread of COVID-19 beyond locations' detection and reporting capacities.",
