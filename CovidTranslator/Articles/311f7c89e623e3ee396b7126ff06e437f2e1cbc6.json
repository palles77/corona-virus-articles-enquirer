Unfortunately, these agents are not specifically targeted against the immune response to the transplanted organ. As a result, other protective functions of the human immune system are jeopardized. Among them is the body's ability to neutralize malignantly transformed cells, particularly those driven by viral infection. As such, one of the longrecognized side effects of immunosuppression is an increased risk for selected malignancies. The most common malignancies among transplant recipients are nonmelanomatous skin cancers, which may affect nearly a quarter of liver transplant recipients. Other more lifethreatening cancers, however, are present at elevated rates in this patient population and generally involve the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and in particular GI malignancies with the human papillomavirus (Table 97-1) . 1 In a recent analysis of all solid organ transplant recipients using the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)/United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database, the overall incidence of posttransplantation malignancy in liver transplant recipients was 4.46%, with GI cancers (as a whole) being the most common type. 2 Regardless of malignancy type, standard preventative practices (e.g., smoking cessation, sun protection, breast self-examinations) and routine cancer screening examinations (e.g., chest x-ray, colonoscopy, dermatological evaluation) should be highly encouraged after transplantation and incorporated into the posttransplantation management pathway for all recipients.",

The vast majority of infections occur within the first 6 months after transplantation, when the intensity of immunosuppression is at its highest. However, infections may happen at any time and generally occur in a predictable pattern after transplant (Table 97 -2). 4 Common and life-threatening opportunistic infections are addressed in detail in Chapter 78. Long term, the risk for infection persists and is still directly related to a patient's level of immunosuppression. Thus patients undergoing treatment for rejection remain at a high risk for infection, even after therapy has ceased. Although serious bacterial and fungal infections predominate early after transplantation, viral conditions prevail over the long term. These include reactivation of latent herpes viruses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), EBV, herpes simplex, or herpes zoster. The relationship of these reactivations leads many to reinstitute viralspecific prophylaxis when treating for rejection (e.g., ganciclovir). Hepatitis C recurrence is ubiquitous in infected individuals, although the phenotype of recurrence varies considerably from an asymptomatic carrier state to rapid hepatic deterioration. The primary approach for all these conditions includes reduction of immunosuppression in addition to targeted antiviral therapy against hepatitis C. Nearly 100 antiviral agents have been developed against hepatitis C, which are in various experimental phases. The two recently approved agents, boceprevir and telaprevir, are both protease inhibitors that, when used in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, have been shown to improve cure rates with a shorter duration of therapy.",

Specific issues common to patients recovering from hepatic failure include hypogammaglobulinemia and leukocytopenia and should be recognized as clues to limit the immunosuppressive load. Maneuvers to thwart any potential infection after transplantation include (1) treating any donor-related infections, (2) taking precautions against health care-associated bacterial infections (i.e., surgical site, catheter-associated, and urinary tract infections; ventilator-assisted pneumonias), and (3) providing prophylaxis against potential opportunistic infections via the routine use of antimicrobials such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amphotericin, and ganciclovir.",

The mechanisms resulting in hyperglycemia include (1) a reduction in insulin production, (2) an increase in gluconeogenesis, (3) a decrease in peripheral glucose utilization, and (4) reduced glycogen synthesis. These effects are thought to be dose dependent, because reduced doses of CS have been shown to decrease insulin resistance. 8 In addition, CSs enhance appetite, particularly for sweetened foods. As will be described later, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) contribute significantly to the development of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM). Even though many programs have employed steroid avoidance or low-maintenance-dose CS protocols, PTDM remains a considerable problem. Thus one can extrapolate that PTDM is primarily due to the CNI. The prevalence of dyslipidemia has been documented in up to 45% of liver transplant recipients. 9 The mechanism or mechanisms leading to dyslipidemia are not clear but may be due to steroid-induced insulin resistance, which leads to increased levels of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Lipogenesis may also be pronounced with CS use.",

If the proteinuria is less than 300 mg/day, the renal dysfunction can be reversed through conversion of CNI to SRL. In those patients with established proteinuria of more than 300 mg/day, a conversion to SRL may exacerbate the existing proteinuria and accelerate renal dysfunction.

The same antiproliferative mechanism that is thought to produce their beneficial oncological effects (e.g., against hepatocellular carcinoma) may also account for their poor wound-healing properties (by limiting fibroblast proliferation). Examples of wound complications include tracheal dehiscence in lung transplant recipients and an increased occurrence of lymphoceles in kidney transplant recipients. 39, 40 The literature assessing wound complications in liver transplant is not plentiful. Early experiences with SRL in liver transplantation confirmed that wound infections and dehiscences were more frequent. 41, 42 However, initial trials with SRL used higher doses and trough levels than is generally used today. In one randomized controlled trial looking at the efficacy of EVR, there was a trend for more incisional hernias in the EVR arm (46% versus 27%, P = .16). 43 In the recent PROTECT study on EVR in liver transplantation, no increase in wound-healing problems was noted. 44 At the Baylor Simmons Transplant Institute we have vast experience using SRL in our liver transplant patients, with both de novo and conversion therapy. The rate of wound complications, including the development of incisional hernias, is anecdotally high (and currently being reviewed). For the transplant patient on de novo SRL, incisions are monitored carefully. An incision-line wound vacuum-assisted closure can assist with wound healing. For long-term recipients who have developed an incisional hernia and are taking SRL, precaution is taken before herniorrhaphy by converting the patient off SRL and onto a CNI for 2 weeks before repair, with reinstitution of SRL (and discontinuation of the CNI) at least 4 weeks after repair or until the wound heals completely. This conversion can be carried out with minimal concern for rejection. (Of note, conversion back to SRL requires the readdition of the secondary agent [e.g., mycophenolate or AZA] because SRL monotherapy is not practiced at our center.)",

            "text": "MMF is another purine synthesis inhibitor that essentially replaced AZA as the complementary immunosuppressive agent to the CNI in the early 1990s. CNI-induced toxicities were curtailed by adding MMF, and steroids were withdrawn earlier after liver transplantation. The most common side effects associated with MMF are GI in nature and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and anorexia, which lead to MMF reduction or withdrawal in up to 50% of cases. 51 The active form of MMF, mycophenolic acid (MPA), was developed as enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium in an attempt to improve GI tolerability. Since its release, studies have confirmed therapeutic equivalence when compared to MMF. 52 More importantly, a benefit in GI-related symptoms has been overwhelmingly shown. 53, 54 Another side effect of MMF is myelosuppression, usually in the form of leukopenia and less commonly, anemia. These effects are reversible, however, and appear to be dose related. Whether GI or hematological, an adverse event from MMF may be addressed by dose splitting (i.e., changing the dose from 1000 mg twice daily to 500 mg four times daily), dose reduction, or discontinuation. Because MMF and enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium are usually prescribed in conjunction with other agents, they have not been strongly implicated with an increased incidence of infection. However, in patients using MPA for psoriasis there were multiple reported cases of herpes zoster reactivation. 55, 56 This has also been documented among kidney transplant recipients receiving MPA. 57 In a study from Spain, among 33 adult liver transplant patients on MMF monotherapy, the most common adverse effect was a herpes simplex infection. 58 Thus there may be a link between MMF use and varicella infection. In general, MMF is a safe and effective agent in the prevention of organ transplant rejection. Unlike other agents, long-term toxicities are not cumulative.",

Over the short term, ATG administration is associated with side effects, including flulike symptoms termed cytokine release syndrome, characterized in severe cases by tachycardia, dyspnea, chest pain, pulmonary edema, and fever. Premedication with acetaminophen, an antihistamine, and steroids usually ameliorates the symptoms. The syndrome is most prevalent during the first dose and abates with repeated doses. Serum sickness, manifesting as an urticarial rash and arthralgias, occurs in some patients, particularly if they have prior exposure to ATG. This typically emerges after several doses have been given. Pancytopenia is also commonly seen. Only a few reports have been published regarding long-term follow-up of patients receiving ATG as an induction agent in liver transplantation. These studies have not suggested an increased risk for infectious complications or malignancy after transplantation. 59, 60 Interleukin-2 receptor inhibitors, basiliximab and daclizumab, are inert agents, causing neither infusionrelated phenomena nor untoward long-term side effects such as nephrotoxicity. Early studies in liver transplantation focused on their ability to provide effective early immunosuppression in recipients with renal dysfunction, allowing for delayed introduction of a CNI. In addition, daclizumab was shown to be effective in reducing acute rejection episodes while avoiding steroid therapy. 61, 62 However, basiliximab showed no significant improvement over a conventional immunosuppressive regimen. 63 In a meta-analysis of randomized trials on these interleukin--2 blockers, no evidence of increased infections or malignancies was noted at 1-year after transplantation. 64 Finally, in a multicenter trial by Klintmalm et al 65 the addition of daclizumab to the immunosuppressive regimen of hepatitis C patients did not show a clear benefit over standard treatment. As a result, we no longer use any induction agents or steroids on our patients with viral hepatitis.",

As a result it has been used increasingly in recent years to prevent rejection in organ transplant recipients. Conversely, there are concerns about the risks for infection and malignancy due to its mechanism of action. In a review of 547 patients receiving various organ transplants (liver transplants, N = 54 [10%]) at the University of Pittsburgh, alemtuzumab used in the treatment of rejection was shown to cause more opportunistic infections (namely CMV) than alemtuzumab used for induction therapy. 66 In a multicenter study on kidney transplantation, alemtuzumab was evaluated against patients receiving conventional therapy (i.e., rabbit ATG or basiliximab induction). The incidence of malignancy was higher in the alemtuzumab group (P = .03), and the rate of serious adverse infectious events with alemtuzumab was greater when compared to basiliximab (35% versus 22%, P = .02), but similar compared to ATG. 67 In liver transplantation there is scant literature on the long-term effects of this antibody. However, a recent retrospective study on non-hepatitis C recipients receiving alemtuzumab found a greater incidence of infections, specifically viral, when compared to those who did not receive induction. 68 The incidence of malignancy was not different between the groups.",
