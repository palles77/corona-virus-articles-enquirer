In this study, we used molecular and serological methods to describe 4 years of incidence and seasonality of hospitalized HPIV-1-, HPIV-2-, and HPIV-3associated acute lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) from two provinces in rural Thailand.",

Specimen aliquots collected during the first two study years were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, where they were tested for HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and HPIV-3 RNA by RT-PCR assays 8, 9 and for HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and HPIV-3 IgG antibodies by indirect enzyme immunoassay. 10 Serology was used for diagnosis, not to describe immunological characteristics. For the last 2 years, specimens were tested at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Thailand using only real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays. We did not test for HPIV-4. In addition, during September 1, 2003, to August 30, 2005, virus isolation was performed at NIH using previously described methods. 11 Total nucleic acids were extracted from swab specimens at CDC using the QIAamp Virus BioRobot MDx Kit on a BioRobot MDx Workstation (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA); at NIH, Thailand, extractions were performed manually using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen). Recovered nucleic acids were tested by two different RT-PCR methods: samples collected during the first two study years were tested by GeneScan RT-PCR assays as previously described, 9 and samples from subsequent years were tested by newly developed rRT-PCR assays described here. Briefly, multiple primer \u2044 probes targeting type-specific conserved regions of each of the HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and HPIV-3 hemagglutinin-neuraminidase genes were designed from alignments of sequences available from GenBank and CDC databases using Primer Express (version 3.0, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Beacon Designer software (version 5.0, Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Primers \u2044 probes that gave the best performance in rRT-PCR assays for each virus were selected for the subsequent study (Table 1) . Amplification conditions and reagents were identical to those previously described. 4 All swab specimens were also tested by RT-PCR for human GAPDH or RNase P housekeeping genes as a control for specimen quality.",

Similarly, for patients whose CXRs were not reviewed by the radiology panel, we assumed that the proportion with radiographic confirmation of pneumonia was the same as for patients whose CXRs were reviewed. We calculated confidence intervals for adjusted age-specific incidence rates using the 95% confidence intervals of the proportion of HPIV-positive tests assuming a binomial distribution. We described seasonal patterns by calculating the proportion of enrolled patients with HPIV detection for each month. We performed all analyses using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).",

Even though prospective enrollment of hospitalized patients in a well-defined population with independent radiographic confirmation of pneumonia provided a robust estimate of HPIV-associated pneumonia incidence, our study included only hospitalized patients with CXR performed, which only represents one part of the severe end of the disease spectrum. As HPIV infection also causes other syndromes that can require hospitalization, such as croup and asthma exacerbation, as well as less severe disease, HPIV infection burden in Thailand likely exceeds our estimates. In the third year of our study, we used only RT-PCR to detect HPIV without serology and likely failed to identify a few patients. However, approximately 90% of infections for each HPIV type were detected by RT-PCR in the first 2 years when both methods were used.
