HE esterase activity towards 4-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) was determined by detection of the chromogenic p-nitrophenolate anion (pNP) that is formed upon hydrolysis (Vlasak et al., 1987) . Briefly, 50 ng HE was incubated with 1 mM pNPA in PBS and the amount of pNP was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm every 20 sec for 15 min. Assays were corrected for spontaneous hydrolysis of pNPA. One unit was defined as the amount of enzymatic activity resulting in the cleavage of 1 \u00b5mol of pNPA per min. The specific activities of the varies HE + -Fc proteins were expressed in mU/\u00b5g of protein and shown in graphs as percentages of wildtype BCoV HE + -Fc activity. USA/1967 were constructed by targeted RNA recombination (Kuo et al., 2000) and propagated in LR7 cells (Lissenberg et al., 2005) . BCoV strain Mebus and OC43 strain USA/1967, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were propagated in HRT-18 cells.",

Comparison of BCoV HE and HKU1 HE, related to Figure 5. (A) Amino acid alignment of BCoV HE with representatives of the two HCoV-HKU1 HE clades (designated clades A and B). Domain organization is color-coded (membrane-proximal domain, red; esterase domain, green; lectin domain, blue). Residues crucial for esterase activity (SGNDH) are annotated below. Amino acid differences are marked in black. (B) Surface representation of BCoV-Mebus HE in complex with 9-O-Ac-Sia (PDB ID: 3CL5) with the amino acid mutations (green) and deletions (violet) that occurred in HKU1 HE visualized. The catalytic triad is indicated in red.9-O-Ac-SiaOC43 merge sFigure 5. Destruction of endogenous receptors in OC43-infected HEK293T cells, related toFigures 5 and 6. Cells were PFA-fixed, Triton-X100-permeabilized and double-stained for 9-O-Ac-Sia with virolectin P4(Langereis et al., 2015) and for OC43 proteins with serum from a BCoVinfected cow. Nuclei (N) stained with Hoechst-33258. sTable 1. Data collection and refinement statistics (Related toFigure 4)",
