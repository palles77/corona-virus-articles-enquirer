The ground rice culture was mixed with a commercial purified diet at concentrations of 5, 7.5 and 10% and the fungal mat at concentrations of 1, 2 and 3~. In groups fed the rice-culture diets, weight gains were reduced and all the rats in the group fed the 10~ diet died. Rats fed fungal-mat diets showed a marked reduction in weight gain, and the death rate was high (about 83%) in groups fed the 2 or 3% diet. Gross lesions found in groups fed either type of diet included focal necrosis in the liver, greenish discoloration of the kidneys, gastric ulceration, ulceration of the scrotal epidermis and corneal opacity. Histological changes in the liver included necrosis of the epithelium of biliary ducts, periductal oedema, pericholangitis, periductal fibrosis and disseminated focal hepatocellular necrosis. Necrosis of epithelium occurred also in the extraheptic ducts and was accompanied by an interstitial pancreatitis in certain rats. Foci of leucocytes and macrophages were found in the dermis of the scrotum and in the epididymal adipose connective tissue. Ulceration of the epidermis occurred late in the sequence of scrotal changes. Ocular lesions comprised corneal oedema, interstitital keratitis, iridocyclitis and hypopyon. Renal lesions consisted of tubular necrosis and hyaline and biliary casts within convoluted tubules.",

Renal lesions comprised necrosis of the convoluted tubules and the presence of biliary casts within the convoluted tubules and collecting ducts. This spectrum of lesions was similar to that observed in mice and rats fed an Indiana isolate of Penicillium viridicatum (Budiarso, Carlton & Tuite, 1971; Carlton, Tuite & Mislivec, 1968 . This report describes the mycotoxicosis produced in rats by cultural products of an isolate of A. ochraceus. EXPERIMENTAL Rice cultures and fungal mats of A. ochraceus were prepared as previously described (Zimmermann et al. 1976 ) and mixed with a purified diet. Rice culture at dietary concentrations of 5, 7.5 and 10% and ground fungal mat at concentrations of 1, 2 and 3% were fed to groups of 12 male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats for a period of 5 wk. Control rats were fed a purified diet mixed with 10% rice treated with 1~o propionic acid. Rats were housed in individual stainless-steel cages in an environmentally controlled room with the temperature maintained between 21 and 24\u00b0C. Water and feed were provided ad lib. The rats were weighed weekly. Rats that died, those killed when moribund and those killed when the experiments were terminated after 5 wk were autopsied. The liver, kidney, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, scrotum and eye were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, processed for paraffin sectioning, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histopathological examination.",

Rats autopsied after 7-10 days of feeding had variably-sized green pinpoint or larger loci throughout the various lobes. The majority were just under the capst, le. although a few were visible on the cut surface. Gastric ulceration was found in a few rats fed either the fungal-mat or rice-culture diets (Fable 2). These gastric lesions ranged from pinpoint craters to areas several millimeters in diameter within the glandular portion of the stomach. The mucosa surrounding the lesions was often swollen and was covered with considerable mucous. The majority of scrotal lesions occurred after 2wk and were cvident initially as dark areas about the midline accompanied by partial alopecia. Subsequently, small round to elliptical lesions followed the initial oedematous phase; these were often covered by a thin reddish scab which later became thickened and brownishblack. Additional loci developed, both laterally and posteriorly, and with expansion and coalescence the entire scrotal skin became necrotic. Occasionally linear areas of necrosis progressed anteriorly from the groin towards the flank, and rarely, small necrotic loci were found on the medial aspects of the thigh and on the tailhead. The penis and penile sheath were free of lesions. Most rats with necrosis of the scrotal skin also had a variable degree of epididymal fat necrosis. Grossly, involvement of the testes was not observed.",

The lesions in the grossly swollen scrota were numerous loci of leucocytes and macrophages or a diffuse infiltration of mixed inflammatory cells within the epididymal connective tissue (Fig. 8) . Later, the overlying epithelium became necrotic and the dermis and subctuaneous adipose connective tissue contained leucocytes and macrophages. Frequently, the walls of arterioles and venules had undergone fibrinoid necrosis (Fig. 9) . In some rats fed for a longer period, medium to large loci of mainly mononuclear inflammatory cells were found within the epididymal fat, the principal site of involvement being the anterior epididymal adipose connective tissue. The adipose tissue was infiltrated mainly by leucocytes and macrophages arranged in either irregular foci, trabeculae or bands. Often, the loci of leucocytes were necrotic and mineralized. In severely affected rats, the inflammatory exudate extended dorsally and laterally within the serotal fascia and into the fibrous connective tissue about the epididymal ducts. The epididymal ducts were often affected by the advancing necrotizing reaction, resulting in periductal inflammation, necrosis of duct walls and accumulation of inflammatory cells within the ductal lumina (Fig. 10) . No changes were noted either in the testicular interstitium or in the seminiferous tubules.",

In some eyes, the basal layers of the corneal epithelium were separated by mild intercellular oedema, while in those more severely affected the substantia propria was diffusely infiltrated by neutrophils. Neocapillary vascularization was an infrequent finding, lridocyclitis and hypopyon accompanied the acute interstitial keratitis in some eyes. The exudate in the anterior chamber consisted on neutrophils and mononuclear cells with formation of small keratic precipitates. Iridocyclitis was characterized by an accumulation of neutrophils within the stroma of the iris and ciliary body.

            "text": "Development of lesions in the liver of rats fed diets containing a rice culture or fungal mat of A. ochraceus followed a fairly definite pattern. Early, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the bile-duct epithelium was accompanied by proliferation of the bile ducts. Later, a necrotizing cholangitis was associated with extension of the necrosis into the surrounding hepatic parenchyma, with periductal fibrosis and with stenosis and obliteration of the bile ducts. The hepatic lesions were identical to those produced in mice and rats by cultural products of P. oiridicatmn (Budiarso et al. 1971; Carlton et al. 1968 McCracken, Carlton & Tuite, 1974c) and in mice by cultural products of A. ochraceus (Zimmermann et al. 1976 ). The morphological pattern of the hepatic lesions in rats and mice suggested that the lesion began in the intrahepatic bile ducts and that the necrosis of the surrounding tissue was the result of the damage to the biliary system, allowing leakage of bile or toxin(s) into the svrrounding hepatic parenchyma. The hepatic lesions observed in these rats showed some similarity to lesions induced in rats by sporidesrain (Remington, Slater, Spector, Strauli & Willoughby, 1962) . However, the pleural effusions and ascites that were prominent findings in sporidesmin poisoning were not seen in the rats of this study. Other hepatotoxic mycotoxins do not produce a necrotizing cholangitis or cholangiohepatitis and most are characterized by hepatic degeneration and necrosis, sometimes accompaneid by bile-duct hyperplasia. Such mycotoxins include the aflatoxins (Wogan, 1965) , luteoskyrin (Kobayashi, Uraguchi, Sakai, Tatsuno, Tsukioka, Sakai, Sato, Miyake, Saito, Enomoto, Shikata & Ishiko, 1958; Uraguchi, Tatsuno, Sakai, Tsukioka, Sakai, Yonemitsu, Ito, Miyake, Saito, Enomoto, Shikata & Ishiko, 1961) , cyclopiazonie acid (Purchase, 1971) , the epoxytrichothecenes (Saito, Enomoto & Tatsuno, 1969) and rubratoxin A produced by certain strains of P. rubrum (Wogan, Edwards & Newberne, 1971) . Ochratoxin A toxicosis results in non-specific hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis. However, this particular mycotoxin has not been found in our isolate of A. ochraceus. Several species of Aspergilli can produce sterigmatocystin, which causes focal hepatic necrosis, proliferation of bile ducts, pericholangitis and hyperplastic nodules (Purchase & van der Watt, 1969) . Of the mycotoxins, then, only the sporidesmins (and the pigments xanthomegnin and viomellein) elicit tissue responses similar to those observed with A. ochraceus and P. viridicatum. Metabolites with chemical characteristics consistent with the sporidesmins have not been isolated from cultures of A. ochraceus or P. viridieatum.",

Budiarso, Carlton & Tuite (1970) described testicular lesions in mice fed P. viridicotura. No set of similar scrotal lesions has been reported in the rat as a result of either an infection or a mycotoxicosis. Scrotal lesions in our rats began and were most severe and numerous in the epididymal fat. At an early stage, mononuclear cells infiltrated the dermis and the epididymal fat and these infiltrates formed discrete accumulations of leucocytes and macrophages frequently oriented about blood vessels. Later, bands of necrotic leucocytes and macrophages transsected the junction between the dermis and subcutis with obliteration of large portions of the epididymal adipose connective tissue. The epidermis was not consistently involved and most often seemed to be secondarily affected at a late stage of the cellulitis. The development of lesions deep within the scrotal tissue, many centering about blood vessels, and the lack of concomitant involvement of the epidermis indicated that the changes were the result of circulating toxin(s) and not due to surface contamination with toxic diet. Several of the trichothecenes, such as diacetoxyscirpenol, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, nivalenol and fusarium-X produced by several species of Fusarium and other fungal genera, are highly toxic when applied topically to the skin of rats, mice and rabbits, but cutaneous lesions have not been described following oral or parenteral administration (Bamburg & Strong, 1971) .",

The earliest alteration was corneal oedema and this was often followed by interstitial keratitis and hypopyon. Because normal hydration and transparency of the corneal stroma is dependent upon the balance between the influx of fluid into and the active transport of fluid out of the stroma (Dikstein & Maurice, 1.972; Mishima & Hayakawa, 1972) and because the control mechanism for this resides in the corneal endothelium (Dikstein & Maurice, 1972; Mishima & Hayakawa, 1972) , it seems possible that circulating toxin(s) might be present in the anterior chamber, resulting in damage to the corneal endothclium. McCracken, Carlton & Tuite (1974a) described similar ocular lesions in rats fed cultures of P. viridicatum. Several fungal extracts and mycotoxins have produced corneal opacity when applied topically into the conjunctival sac of rabbits. These include purified sporidesmin and extracts of Pithomyces chartarum (Done, Mortimer, Taylor & Russell, 1961) , patulin (Broom. Bulbring. Chapman, Hampton, Thomson, Ungar. Wein & Woolfe, 1944) and diacetoxyscirpenol (Brian, Dawkins, Grove, Hemming, Lowe & Norris, 1961) , but none of these are known to produce ocular lesions following oral or parenteral administration.",

Stack, Eppley, Dreifuss & Pohland (1977) isolated viomellein and xanthomegnin pigments from an Indiana isolate of P. oiridicatum, which produced hepatic lesions in mice and rats identical to those induced by our strain of A. ochraceus. These pigments, xanthomegnin and viomellein, incorporated into a purified diet and fed to mice, produced hepatic lesions identical to those produced by cultural products of P. oiridicatum (Carlton, Stack & Eppley, 1976) . Experiments are currently being conducted to determine whether these pigments and others are also present in cultural products of A. ochraceus.",
