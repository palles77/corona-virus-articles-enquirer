Gastric ulcers are a common post-mortem finding in rabbits, especially in those that have been anorexic prior to death. In a survey of 1000 post-mortem examinations by Hinton (1980) , 7.3% were found to have ulceration of the gastric mucosa that was related to the stress of the associated illness. Experimental stress ulcers have been induced in the gastric mucosa of laboratory rabbits by administering intraperitoneal injections of adrenaline (Behara et al., 1980) . Stress can alter the differential white cell count in any species. Rabbits are particularly susceptible to the effects of stress. A car journey to the surgery, a period in the waiting room next to a barking dog or the excitement of handling can be reflected in the blood picture. Adrenaline and cortisol affect the distribution of lymphocytes throughout the body. Administration of exogenous adrenaline to rabbits results in redistribution of lymphocytes from spleen and bone marrow to peripheral blood, lungs and liver (Toft et al., 1992a) . Conversely, exogenous corticosteroid administration results in a redistribution of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen to the lymphatic tissue in rabbits (Toft et al., 1992b) . Prolonged periods of stress cause lymphopaenia. Rabbits suffering from clinical symptoms of dental disease have significantly lower lymphocyte counts than healthy rabbits kept under free-range conditions (Harcourt-Brown and Baker, 2001 ) (see Figure 6 .1).",

Full sexual receptivity occurs every 18 days and is manifested by restlessness and increased chin rubbing. Does are fertile immediately after kindling, especially during the summer months. Breeders usually take females to the buck for mating rather than vice versa as they can be territorial and attack the buck if he is put in her hutch. Sometimes the two are introduced on neutral territory. In general, females are mated for the first time at approximately 5 months old and are not bred from over the age of 3 years (Sandford, 1996) . Mating takes place within a few minutes and can be accompanied by a scream from either party, which is deemed to be normal. Mating may be repeated after a couple of hours to improve the conception rate. Artificial insemination is a recognized technique in rabbit breeding. Pregnancy can be detected by abdominal palpation. The best time for pregnancy diagnosis is 10-14 days after mating when the fetal units can be felt as olive-sized masses. Fetal resorption can take place up to 20 days post-coitus. Mammary development occurs in late pregnancy. Radiographically, pregnancy can be detected after the 11th day.",

            "text": "Gestation takes 31-32 days. Some does remain sexually receptive during pregnancy and will continue to be mated by a male companion. During late pregnancy the doe may be seen carrying bedding material into her chosen nesting site. The nest is built from hay, straw or other bedding material. The quality of the nest varies between individual does and has a strong influence on the survival of the young. The doe will defend her chosen nesting site against potential intruders, especially if she is pregnant or lactating and can become aggressive towards owners, other rabbits or pets. Hair is pulled from the hip, dewlap and mammary glands to line the nest. She may consume less food at this point and should be tempted to eat, as pregnancy toxaemia is a risk during this period. Otherwise, the doe should be left undisturbed. Parturition usually takes place in the morning and lasts less than 30 minutes. When the entire litter has been born, the doe pulls more fur from her body to cover the litter in its nest. Does are particularly susceptible to disturbance in the first few days after parturition and may cannibalize the young. Inexperienced does sometimes mutilate them. The legs or ears may be attacked or the skin stripped over the neck, thorax or abdomen. Cannibalization and mutilation are most likely to take place on the day of parturition and may be an extension of eating the placenta. Sometimes young rabbits are born outside the nest or the doe rejects them. These kits will die from hypothermia unless they are warmed up and returned to the nest. The doe will usually accept them and the chances of survival are far greater if the kit is reared by its natural mother rather than being hand-reared by a human. It is advisable to remove other rabbits from the hutch during late pregnancy. Female companions can cannibalize the young and entire males will mate the doe within hours of her giving birth. Females can lactate and be pregnant at the same time and have a second litter within a few weeks of the first. The doe only feeds the young once or twice daily taking 3-5 minutes (see Section 1.4.). Owners often think the young have been deserted and need reassurance that it is normal for the mother to be out of the nest and that she may be particularly aggressive and protective during this period. Lactation takes place for approximately 5 weeks after parturition.",

In the wild, although the doe remains in close vicinity of the nest, she does not groom the young or keep them warm. Nests are hidden, well insulated and secure. The babies drink sufficient milk in 2-5 minutes to last 24 h. It is possible for baby rabbits to survive for more than 24-h intervals between feeds, which explains why females can rear litters that exceed their number of nipples (Lang, 1981) . Suckling normally takes place in the early morning and, if the doe does return to the nest to feed the young for a second time, then it is usually in the first few days after giving birth. The baby rabbits spend most of the day buried in the warmest part of the nest, tightly grouped together conserving heat and energy. After about 22 h, the whole group becomes active and makes its way to the surface (McBride, 1988) . When the mother arrives, she stands over the babies which suckle, changing nipples and position approximately every 30 seconds. After about 3 minutes, the doe leaves the nest and the babies urinate on the surface before digging themselves deep into the bedding to sleep for another 22 h. Young rabbits are totally dependent on milk until day 10. They are usually eating small amounts of solid food by day 15 (Kraus et al., 1984) and start to leave the nest and be weaned at about 3 weeks of age.",

If owners are concerned, the nest can be checked once a day and if the babies are warm, asleep and unwrinkled then they are being fed. Baby rabbits that are not being fed will be restless and crawling around on the surface of the nest. They take on a wrinkled appearance due to dehydration. It is possible to cross-foster orphaned rabbits to another lactating doe. It is not necessary to use any method for destroying the scent of the natural mother or human hand. Females do not make any distinction of young, even if they are of different colours or sizes (Cheeke et al., 1982) . Ideally, older rabbits should be introduced to a younger litter.

Milk replacers are a nutritional compromise and do not match the composition of rabbit milk. Therefore orphan rabbits may need feeding two to three times daily, but care should be taken not to overfeed or force-feed them. Holding newborn rabbits on their backs simulates the natural nursing position. Hypothermic or moribund rabbits can be given fluids or milk replacers by stomach tube to correct hypoglycaemia.

A syringe with a small amount of tubing cut from a giving set is a satisfactory method of feeding orphans. Healthy babies suck the milk out of the syringe. Squirting milk into the mouth carries a risk of choking the rabbit. Enteritis is a potentially lethal complication of hand-rearing. Rabbits are unusual among young animals in having very few microorganisms in the stomach and small intestine while suckling (Lang, 1981 ). An antimicrobial fatty acid or 'milk oil' is present in the suckling rabbit. It is produced by an enzymatic reaction in the doe's milk that takes place in the suckling rabbit's stomach (Brooks, 1997) . This 'milk oil' controls the gastrointestinal microbial contents of suckling rabbits and protects them from enteric infection. Orphan rabbits that are fed on milk from other species do not develop this antimicrobial factor and are therefore more susceptible to bacterial infections introduced during feeding. It is important that boiled water and sterile syringes and feeding tubes are used to feed orphans and that each feed is made up just prior to being given. Overfeeding can cause digestive upsets. In general, it is preferable to underfeed than overfeed. Small babies can soon make up their weight once they are weaned and able to digest solid food.",

Very excitable or aggressive rabbits can be caught and removed from the carrier in a towel. Picking rabbits up by their ears is not acceptable and is no longer advocated, although it is recommended in some older texts. After being removed from the carrier, the rabbit can be held on the consulting table and observed while a clinical history is being obtained from the owner. To examine the perineum, the rabbit can be restrained in dorsal recumbency either by holding the scruff and lying the rabbit on its back or by cradling it like a baby in the arms of an assistant or the owner. Dorsal recumbency often evokes an immobility response. An alternative approach is to hold the rabbit upright and rest its rear end on the consulting table.

Although hypnosis has been described for more invasive techniques such as castration (Okerman, 1988) , it is not a humane alternative to anaesthesia or analgesia. There is controversy about placing conscious rabbits in dorsal recumbency at all. On one hand, some practitioners lie rabbits on their backs to perform a variety of procedures such as nail clipping, oral administration of medicines and even inserting mouth gags to examine or clip molars. On the other hand, there is a view that the immobility response occurs in stressful situations and that rabbits lying on their backs are terrified and waiting to be eaten. However, it is a useful technique in some situations. For, example, it is possible to immobilize conscious rabbits for long enough to take abdominal radiographs.",

            "text": "The immobility response is exhibited in prey species under conditions that are stressful or threatening. The phenomenon is characterized by lack of spontaneous movement and failure to respond to external stimuli for several minutes. In rabbits, there is hypotonia of flexor and extensor musculature, abolition of the righting reflex, depression of spinal reflexes, miosis, and a drop in blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate. An awareness of external stimuli is maintained, although there is a decreased response to noise and painful stimuli (Danneman et al., 1988) . This trance-like state is induced in the laboratory by placing the rabbit in dorsal recumbency, covering its eyes with its ears and flexing its chin against the neck. The hind legs are stretched out for a few minutes before releasing the legs and gently stroking the chest and abdomen. As long as the head is flexed, the rabbit remains immobile and restraining devices have been designed to maintain this position (Bivin, 1994) . There are similarities between the immobility response and an opiate-induced state. The exact role of endogenous opioid systems is controversial and there are conflicting reports about the effects of naloxone which, theoretically, should prevent or reverse the hypnotic state (Danneman et al., 1988) . Sudden noise or painful stimuli can interrupt the trance and there is considerable variation in individual susceptibility to the technique. In a study by Danneman et al. (1988) , the immobility response could not be evoked in 25% of rabbits. In the consulting room, some pet rabbits can be calmed and restrained by placing them in dorsal or lateral recumbency and gently stroking their stomach while speaking to them quietly. Blowing gently on their face or stroking the bridge of the nose can also be effective.",

For example, owners do not like to admit that the rabbit has not been out of its hutch for months or that it is weeks since they cleaned out its cage. When an owner says they feed 'lots of greens', this can mean half a cabbage leaf once a week or a diet exclusively of hay and vegetables. Misleading information can be given in response to enquiries about the amount of grass a rabbit eats. There seems to be reluctance on the part of owners to pick grass to feed to rabbits although they may be willing to put them out in a run on the lawn to graze. The length of time that a rabbit has access to grass varies considerably, from a couple of hours on two or three occasions during the summer months to several hours a day all year round. Owners often insist that their rabbit will not eat fresh greens, grass and weeds. Because the owner's perception is that the rabbit will not eat such food, they do not offer it. It is interesting how many hospitalized rabbits readily eat grass and dandelions despite their owner's protestations that their pet would not eat such a diet at home.",

A healthy rabbit, that is eating well, passes large quantities of hard faeces and eats the soft caecotrophs (see Table  3 .1). The number of hard faeces varies with the fibre content of the diet. A healthy 2.5-3 kg rabbit produces about 150 hard faecal pellets a day (Lowe, 1998) . Hard pellets can be expelled at any time but are always produced overnight. Absence of hard faeces is indicative of anorexia or reduced intestinal motility. Small faecal pellets are produced following periods of reduced food intake.",

Uneaten caecotrophs are sometimes seen as shiny clusters of dark pasty pellets in the bedding of normal animals. Uneaten caecotrophs are often interpreted as diarrhoea. This is not surprising as caecotrophs have a strong smell and a soft consistency in comparison with the hard faecal pellets. Obesity, spinal problems and dental disease are among the many reasons for caecotrophs to be left uneaten (see Figure 10 .6). Uneaten caecotrophs can become entangled in the fur under the tail and form an unpleasant, malodorous faecal mass. Changes in the consistency of caecotrophs can follow ingestion of a new food or a succulent item such as lettuce or fruit. Soft, sticky or liquid caecotrophs may be passed. It is thought that this is due to alterations in the caecal microflora. Rabbits on a high fibre diet have a healthy caecal microflora that can withstand dietary changes. Uneaten caecotrophs are not life threatening although they are unpleasant for the owner and rabbit, and predispose to other conditions such as superficial pyoderma, fly strike and problems with urination due to inflamed painful perineal skin (see Sections 9.7.2, 10.6, and 14.4.3).",

Therefore the amount of calcium carbonate precipitate varies with the calcium content of the diet. The hydration status of the animal and pH of the urine also affect the amount of precipitate. The urine can be clear during periods of high calcium demand such as growth, pregnancy or lactation. A small amount of precipitate is a good sign as it reflects adequate calcium content in the diet. Excessive precipitate can form a thick sludge, especially in the bladder of rabbits that do not urinate frequently (see Section 14.4). High dietary calcium levels exacerbate the problem. Cystitis and urinary incontinence can be the result. It can be difficult to differentiate between normal calcium carbonate deposits and abnormal amounts of sludge.

Counting the adhesion lines in the periosteal zone of the mandible by histopathological examination can be used to age mature rabbits accurately (Henderson and Bowen, 1979) but this is not possible during life. The deciduous teeth are shed at birth and so the only criteria to make an assessment of age during clinical examination, are the size and appearance of the rabbit, both of which vary according to breed and state of health. The claws of the rabbit do not project beyond the fur until the rabbit reaches maturity (Sandford, 1996) but this age varies according to breed and size. Fanciers may be able to give an indication of age by feeling the ears that are soft in the young rabbits and become tougher with age (Sandford, 1996) . Pedigree rabbits may have rings over their hocks on which the year of birth will be recorded. Smaller breeds mature at 4-5 months of age and the larger breeds mature at 5-8 months (Donnelly, 1997) .

            "text": "The perineum is an extremely sensitive area in rabbits. Pain caused by infected, inflamed perineal skin can lead to urine retention, urethritis, cystitis and/or urinary incontinence. Urine scalding can also be due to urogenital disease or indicative of other problems such as vertebral spondylitis, sore hocks or arthritis which prevent the rabbit positioning itself correctly to urinate (see Section 14.4.3). Neurological deficits, abdominal pain or generalized weakness can also lead to urine scalding or perineal soiling. Skin inflammation in the perineal area may be caused by uneaten caecotrophs that have become adherent to the fur and caused superficial pyoderma of the skin beneath. Obesity, dental disease and arthritis prevent grooming around the perineum so the fur becomes matted, soiled and infected. This starts a vicious circle that can be broken by clipping and cleaning the perineal area and treating the painful dermatitis (see Figure 9 .1 and Section 9.7.3). Clippers can be used to remove most of the fur. A sharp pair of curved, pointed scissors is useful to tease out and cut matted hair around the genitalia and under the tail. Dead and matted hair can be combed out with a flea comb. It is very easy inadvertently to damage the delicate skin. Patience and the correct equipment are required. Sedation may be needed. The underlying reason for urinary incontinence, cystitis, grooming difficulties or uneaten caecotrophs needs to be addressed to prevent recurrence.",

Radiography can be used to differentiate abnormalities detected during abdominal palpation. Ultrasound is also useful. Palpation of the abdomen should be done carefully and gently, as it is easy to traumatize the thinwalled viscera. The spleen is too small to be palpable and the liver is not felt routinely during abdominal palpation. Both kidneys can usually be identified. They are mobile structures. The left kidney lies caudally to the right kidney, which lies close to the rib cage. The stomach cannot be palpated in the normal rabbit. In some cases of gastric stasis, the stomach may be felt as a hard round mass just behind the ribs on the right hand side. Intestinal obstruction causes gross distension of the stomach with gas and liquid (see Box 3.3). The caecum may be felt as a soft pliable structure in the ventral abdomen. The size and contents vary with diet and time of day. A full caecum may be felt as a doughy mass. Caecal impactions are felt as a hard sausage-like structure. Gas distension of the caecum can result from gastrointestinal hypomotility. In these cases, the caecum may not be differentiated from other organs or can be felt as a gas-filled structure that makes a sloshing sound when palpated. The bladder can be felt in the caudoventral abdomen. It should be palpated with care as it can rupture easily, especially if the urethra is partially obstructed by a urolith. Rabbits suffering from urolithiasis or cystitis often strain in response to bladder palpation and may void small amounts of urine on to the consulting table. Gut sounds are not always evident in the healthy rabbit. Absence of gut sounds does not signify intestinal stasis. Tinkling sounds may be heard in distended gas-filled organs such as the caecum or stomach, indicating a gas/fluid interface.",

Medication in the form of intravenous fluids, daily injections or nebulization may be necessary. Regular syringe feeding, clipping and bathing may be required. Observation of behaviour, appetite, faecal and urine output is easier if the rabbit is kept on its own under the careful eye of competent nursing staff. A stress-free environment is required, away from barking dogs and the sight and smell of predators along with a good nursing team who understand the nutritional and physiological requirements of rabbits. Hospitalized rabbits should be provided with a bed of good quality hay to nibble and lie on. The familiar smell of hay gives them security. Some rabbits like a cardboard box to hide in. House rabbits can be very particular in their choice of litter material and may be reluctant to use a tray that does not contain the correct type of litter. Most owners are willing to bring in the correct type of material for their rabbit's litter tray. Fresh water needs to be provided in a drinking container that the rabbit is familiar with. Some rabbits will not use a sipper bottle. It is worth considering hospitalizing a bonded companion of a sick rabbit as they can become stressed if they are separated.",

Intraperitoneal barbiturate is acceptable but can take some time for the animal to lose consciousness. Sedation prior to intravenous barbiturate injection is preferable if the owner wishes to be present. The owner may wait with their rabbit until the sedative has taken effect. A combination of acepromazine and butorphanol (0.5 mg/kg acepromazine plus 0.1 mg/kg butorphanol) can be given by subcutaneous injection and has the advantage of vasodilation that facilitates venepuncture. Alternatively, fentanyl/fluanisone (0.3-0.5 ml/ kg) (Hypnorm, Janssen) can be used but it is given by intramuscular injection, which is more distressing to patient and owner than a subcutaneous injection. Subcutaneous (50 mg/kg) ketamine with or without other agents can be used.

Usually the marginal ear vein or cephalic vein is used due to the ease of keeping the rabbit in the correct position for intravenous fluids to run once the drip is set up. Intravenous catheters can be held in place with adhesive tape or a few drops of Vetbond or superglue. A simple method is to cut one wing off a 21 g or 23 g butterfly set before placing it in the marginal ear vein. The remaining wing can be superglued to the fur on the pinna to keep the needle in place. No bandaging is required to keep the needle in place in sedated or moribund patients, although a piece of bandage tied around the rabbits neck can be used to hold the giving set out of the way. Most rabbits tolerate the procedure well. Superglue is not as satisfactory for keeping intravenous catheters in place because they have a smaller wing that does not provide a large surface area for the bonding agent.",

There are several advantages to this technique which avoids the necessity of cannulating a small collapsed vein in moribund patients. The intraosseous route is often used for small exotic animal patients such as birds, reptiles, guinea pigs and pot-bellied pigs where it is difficult to find a peripheral vein. Most rabbits are large enough and have sufficient accessible veins to use the intravenous route but there are occasions when intraosseous administration of drugs and especially fluids can be life saving. Some practitioners prefer this method of fluid administration and use it routinely. Disadvantages include the risk of introducing infection and causing osteomyelitis. The rate of administration can be slow. These problems can be overcome by using careful aseptic techniques and multiple sites.

Direct penetration of the marrow cavity is easier in the tibia or humerus of the rabbit than the femur. The anatomy of the head of the femur requires penetration of the trochanteric fossa so the cortical bone is penetrated three times instead of once (see Figure 3 .8). The humerus is the preferred site. In conscious animals, local anaesthetic is infiltrated around the injection site, which is clipped and sterilized prior to the introduction of the needle. A 20-22 gauge needle that is about half the length of the bone is required, i.e. 4-6 cm (1.5-2.5 inches). Spinal needles with a stylet that prevents a plug of bone clogging up the bore are most suitable but ordinary hypodermic needles can be used with a smaller gauge needle or a length of wire acting as the stylet. The bone is penetrated by using the needle as a drill. The needle should be kept straight when boring the hole in the bone. Moving the needle from side to side results in a larger hole than is required and leakage of fluid around the injection site. Penetration of the cortex can be felt as a sudden lack of resistance. The needle may need to be redirected slightly to push it down the medullary cavity. It is important to be certain that the tip of the needle is in the medullary cavity and not pushed against or penetrating the cortex. At this point the stylet is removed and a syringe attached to the needle to aspirate bone marrow which confirms correct placement of the needle. If there is any doubt, radiography is indicated. If the needle is not placed correctly, it should be withdrawn and a different bone selected to attempt the procedure again. Once the needle is placed it can be glued or sutured in place. Dressings and antiseptics can be used for protection and to reduce the likelihood of infection. Heparin should be introduced into the catheter every 4-6 h. The needle should not be left in place for longer than 72 h. When it is removed a light dressing and some antiseptic can be applied to the site (Anderson, 1995).",

Anorexia can have dire consequences, especially in fat rabbits as ketoacidosis and hepatic lipidosis can develop rapidly as a result of mobilizing fat reserves. Oral liquids soften and lubricate impacted stomach contents. In the short term, nutritional support is required to provide calories, nutrients, fluids and electrolytes. A readily available source of carbohydrate is required to provide glucose for absorption from the stomach and small intestine and prevent hypoglycaemia and the mobilization of the free fatty acids. In the long term, indigestible fibre and fermentable fibre are required to maintain gut motility and optimal conditions in the caecum for bacterial fermentation. Although fermentable fibre can be administered through a syringe, it is not possible to provide indigestible fibre in this way because it has to be ground down to a fine powder in order to pass through the nozzle. The beneficial effect of long indigestible fibre particles is lost by being ground down to a size smaller than 0.5 mm because particles below this size are moved back into the caecum to undergo bacterial fermentation rather than passing into the colon and stimulating gut motility. Therefore, it is important to encourage sick rabbits to eat as soon as possible. They need a source of palatable indigestible fibre, even if they do not appear to be eating. Hay, grass or dandelions are often the first item to be eaten voluntarily and are often eaten in preference to other foods.",

Alternatively, extruded rabbit food (SupaRabbit Excel, Burgess) can be moistened and mashed to a paste for syringe feeding, although the fibrous particles tend to block the syringe. The food needs to be ground to a powder to prevent this happening, which detracts from its motility stimulatory properties.

To place a nasogastric tube, the rabbit's head is grasped and elevated and the tube introduced into the ventral meatus and directed slightly ventrally (see Figure 3 .9) The head is then flexed as the tube passes through the nasopharynx into the oesophagus and down into the stomach.

A technique for placing a pharyngotomy tube has been described for laboratory rabbits. (Rogers et al., 1988) . Under general anaesthesia a 1 cm incision is made 5 mm from the midline just anterior to the larynx on the lefthand side. A tube is passed through the oral cavity into the oesophagus and down to the stomach. The tube is grasped with artery forceps through the mouth and pushed against the wall of the pharynx to cause a bulge under the skin incision. The muscle overlying the bulge is carefully incised using the hard tip of the artery forceps in the pharynx as a guide. The pharyngeal wall is incised and the oral end of the stomach tube exteriorized through the incision. The tube is then anchored at the pharyngeal incision before being run through the subcutaneous tissues to emerge at the base of the ear where it is anchored with skin sutures. Pharyngotomy tubes placed in this manner have been left in laboratory rabbits for 6-12 months to ensure accurate doses of the drugs that were being tested. The catheters were well tolerated and the rabbits continued to eat and drink without losing weight. This technique could be applied to pet rabbits. Soft feeding tubes designed for oesophagostomy in cats (Cook Veterinary Products) would be suitable for this purpose.",

Significant elevations in plasma glucose levels have been found in rabbits fitted with collars (Knudtzon, 1988) . Elizabethan collars also prevent a rabbit from consuming caecotrophs. Caecotrophs are rich in amino acids and vitamins and necessary for optimum nutrition and wound healing.

A variety of medications, such as antibiotics, can be mixed with warm saline (38\u00b0C) and administered twice a day, via a nebulizer, into the air space of a small cage containing the rabbit. It is important to use isotonic saline as the vehicle. Experimental nebulization of rabbits with hypertonic saline (3.6%) caused extravasation of water into the subepithelial tissue of the airway wall. The formation of oedema was associated with a decrease in compliance and gas exchange (Hogman et al., 1997) .",
