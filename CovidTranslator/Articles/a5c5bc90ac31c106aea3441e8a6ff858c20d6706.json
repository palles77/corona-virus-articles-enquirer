Binding of the low cell culture passaged Miller-6 strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) to villous enterocytes from newborn piglets was at a high level, similar to that observed to cultured swine testis (ST) cells. Binding of the virus to cryptal enterocytes from newborn piglets or to villous or cryptal enterocytes from weaned piglets was significantly lower. In a competitive virus binding assay with radiolabelled virus, the binding of TGEV to ST cells was found to be saturable, while binding to MDBK cells, in which the virus fails to replicate, was at a lower level and was non-saturable. In the same assay, virus binding to the villous enterocytes from the jejunum of a newborn piglet was saturable, while binding to cryptal enterocytes from a newborn piglet, and to villous and cryptal enterocytes from a weaned piglet, was non-saturable. It was concluded that the high susceptibility of newborn piglets to TGEV infection, and the tropism of the virus for villous enterocytes, may relate to the presence of specific, saturable binding sites on the plasma membrane of villous enterocytes.",

Recently, Delmas et al. ( 1992 ) identified aminopeptidase N as a major receptor for TGEV on both ST cells and porcine enterocytes. Aminopeptidase N is also a receptor for the human coronavirus 229E (Yeager et al., 1992) while mouse hepatitis virus attaches to a glycoprotein of the carcinoembryonic antigen family on intestinal brush border and hepatocyte membranes (Williams et al., 1991 ) . The S glycoprotein of the bovine coronavirus was shown recently to attach to a sialic acid receptor on the surface of red blood cells (Schultze et al., 1991 ) , although this virus may also attach to the same receptor by means of the haemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein (Vlasak et al., 1988 ) , which is lacking in TGEV.",

The present findings on the saturability of virus binding to ST cells support this conclusion. Binding of TGEV to MDBK cells, in which the virus fails to replicate, was at a much lower level than to ST cells, and since the binding to MDBK cells was nonsaturable, it is concluded that these cells lack specific receptors for TGEV.",

A high level of alkaline phosphatase activity was found only in the enterocytes harvested from the tips of the villi.

However, in the present study there was a progressive decline in the intensity of periodic acid-Schiff staining, from the villi to the crypts, as described in the rat (Gratecos et al., 1978 ) , corresponding to the glycoprotein content of the plasma membrane, which increases with progressive differentiation of the enterocytes.",

The competitive binding assays indicated that saturable binding occurred only to the villous enterocytes of newborn piglets. Since saturable binding is accepted as evidence of binding to specific receptors on the cell surface (Tardieu et al., 1982) this finding would suggest that specific TGEV receptors on enterocytes are restricted to neonatal villous enterocytes. This could be an important factor contributing to the susceptibility of villous, rather than cryptal enterocytes, to infection with TGEV. The apparent lack of specific virus binding to villous enterocytes from weaned piglets was a somewhat puzzling finding since the virus is capable of infecting these cells in older piglets, although the latter are much less susceptible to infection than newborn piglets. Our use of a cell culture adapted strain of TGEV which is somewhat less virulent than some field strains of the virus may have contributed to this result, but it may be that specific receptors are far fewer in older piglets, and below the level of detection by the methods used in the present study. A low level of specific binding may have been masked by non-specific binding of the virus to the cell surface. It is also possible that the non-specific binding of TGEV to villous enterocytes may lead to productive infection, but much less efficiently than binding to specific receptors. It has been shown that the dose of virus needed to infect an adult pig is 104 times greater than that required to infect a neonate (Witte and Walther, 1976) and this may reflect the sparseness of receptors on the villous enterocytes of older pigs.",

(1979) observed TGE viral particles traversing the intact microvilli of mature enterocytes in the small intestine of an experimentally infected piglet, and postulated the synthesis of brush border receptors as the enterocytes differentiated during their migration from the crypts to the tips of the villi. The present findings provide the first evidence in support of such a hypothesis. The relationship of the aminopeptidase N receptor for TGEV, demonstrated recently by Delmas et al. (1992) , to our findings, remains to be explored by determining the distribution of this enzyme in different enterocyte fractions from newborn and weaned piglets.",
