A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm. Results: We trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. Furthermore, we detected secondary structure information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 different types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly improved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours. Availability: The repository of this project will be published.",

            "text": "Throughout the last decade, technological advancements in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have provided a new approach to solve the structure determination problem. Cryo-EM allows researchers to capture 3D images of large protein complexes by cooling them to cryogenic temperatures without the need of a costly crystallization of the protein [13] . In recent years the resolution of these images has increased to a nearatomic level which led to an exponential gain in popularity of the technology [14] . A 3D image captured through cryo-EM is an electron density map (see Fig 1) . It represents the volume of the protein complex through a 3D grid of voxels. Each voxel stores the electron density value, meaning the probability that an electron is present, for its location. Latest developments in the field of cryo-EM have allowed researchers to capture many high-resolution density maps from large protein complexes in the course of a single study [15] . This makes the ability to predict protein structures from cryo-EM maps fully automatically even more significant as it allows for a very high throughput of protein structures derived from cryo-EM maps. The structure of a protein can be estimated from its density map, intuitively by placing the amino acids in such way that the resulting structure fits well into the density map. While this sounds like a simple task it becomes very challenging due to lower local resolutions as well as noise created through errors in the cryo-EM. Currently, there are several existing methods that perform protein structure predictions based on cryo-EM data such as Phenix and Rosetta [16] , [17] . They both use conventional algorithms to place and connect the amino acids of the protein. However, they often struggle to identify amino acids as such and, therefore, tend to have a low coverage on large protein complex [18] . Furthermore, their long runtime is a problem. The prediction of small density maps can take up to several days rendering the method practically useless for the prediction of large proteins. The C-CNN method, another protein structure prediction application which utilizes deep learning techniques, achieves better results in terms of coverage [18] . However, it requires some manual input and the runtime could be further improved. Additionally, it predicts the location of C\u03b1 atoms without information about their amino acid type. Therefore, we present the DeepTracer, a new fully automated method for the prediction of protein structures from cryo-EM density maps, with the goal of improving the runtime by applying a 3D U-Net in combination with a modified travelling salesman algorithm and having the ability of recognizing the amino acid type from 3D cryo-EM density maps.",

The detailed architecture of the model can be seen in Fig 2. The cryo-EM density maps are fed to the 64 # input layer. The output layer has the same 64 # shape with N different channels. The number of channels depends hereby on what the U-Net is predicting (e.g. the secondary structure U-Net has three channels for loops, sheets, and helices). The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.946772 doi: bioRxiv preprint As mentioned above, the U-Net should predict multiple things, including the amino acid positions, secondary structure elements, as well as the amino acid types. Therefore, the model consists of three parallel U-Nets as shown in Fig 3. The first one is responsible for predicting the amino acid positions. As the Ca atom of each amino acid is central to its position we can reduce this task to only predicting the Ca atoms of the protein structure. Additionally, this U-Net also predicts the backbone location of the protein, which is defined as the position of all Ca, C, and N atoms of the structure. This prediction will later on be useful in order to connect the amino acids into chains. Thus, the output of the C\u03b1 atoms U-Net has two channels. The second U-Net is responsible for predicting the secondary structure elements and, therefore, its output has three channels, one for each structural element (\u03b1-helix, loop, and sheet). Finally, the third U-Net is tasked to predict the amino acid types of the protein structure. Since there are 20 different types of amino acids occurring in nature its output has the same number of channels. In Now that we have looked at the architecture of the model, we can continue with the data collection. In order for the deep learning model to learn common noises and errors present in cryo-EM density maps we decided to train the U-Net using experimental data rather than density maps simulated from solved structures such as [18] . We downloaded the density maps from the EMDataResource website [20] in combination with their solved protein structures which function as the ground truth for the training process. We obtained the solved structures from the RCSB Protein Data Bank [21] . Since this paper is focused on high resolution maps, we only used density maps with a resolution of 4\u00c5 or better. In total we used 411 different density maps to build the training and validation sets.",

Furthermore, we need to adjust the dimensions of the map to the 64 # input dimensions of the model as seen in Fig 2. This is done by splitting the maps into several 64 # big cubes. In order to avoid errors at the borders of the cubes we overlay them partly such that we only use the 50 # center voxels of each cube to reconstruct the output maps to the original dimensions of the density map. By splitting the 411 density maps that we collected in this manner, we retrieve 16,070 training examples. To create the labels that the model can be trained on, we use the solved structure to create masks by filtering out the corresponding atoms and setting all voxels within a certain distance to those atoms to one. For the C\u03b1 mask we filter only the C\u03b1 atoms of the protein structure and set all directly neighboring voxels around them to one. The backbone mask is created similarly except that we use all C\u03b1, C, and N atoms. To generate the secondary structure masks, we filter out all atoms for each structural element and set all voxels within a distance of two around each filtered atom to one. Finally, to create the amino acid type masks we filter out all atoms for each amino acid type and set all neighboring voxels to one for each atom. In total this gives us 25 different masks for each training example (C\u03b1 mask, backbone mask, three secondary structure masks, and 20 amino acid type masks).",

With the aim of doing so, we first locate the screw axis, the center line around which the helix winds itself, for each \u03b1-helix. This is achieved by calculating the centroid of consecutive intervals of the \u03b1-helix and then connecting them to approximate the true curve. An example of an \u03b1-helix and its calculated screw axis can be seen in Now that we know the location and shape of the screw axis for the \u03b1helix, we need to incorporate this information into Equation 2. This is achieved by interpreting t as the distance that we travelled on the screw axis and use the unit direction vector of the screw axis at a certain point t as the new z axis. Next, we can find the new y-axis by calculating the cross product of the x-axis and the new z-axis and then normalizing it. Finally, we can get the new x-axis by calculating the cross product of the new z and y-axis and normalizing it again. By concatenating the three new axes we can get a rotation matrix RM with which we can calculate the point of the \u03b1-helix for any value t as shown in Equation 3.

We can see in the highlighted areas that the DeepTracer incorrectly connected amino acids in two cases. However, all predicted amino acids are still connected as a single chain. In comparison to that the prediction of Phenix is fragmented into multiple chains. Furthermore, amino acids appear to be missing from the prediction explaining the coverage difference of 8.1% (see Table 1 ). The predicted secondary structure elements in the Phenix prediction, particularly for sheets, appear also much less accurate than the ones made by the DeepTracer. Another noteworthy observation, although not a fair comparison as Phenix predicts more than just the backbone structure, is that the prediction runtime of Phenix for the EMD-6272 map was 1 hour and 45 minutes while the runtime of the DeepTracer for the same map was 40 seconds.

This makes it possible to predict ever larger density maps which allows for a more versatile application of the method.

First, we see that the percentage of false positives predicted by the DeepTracer has increased by 1.9% compared to the C-CNN method. This can be explained through the manual thresholding which reduces noises in the experimental density maps and is utilized in the C-CNN method. However, considering that this step introduces manual effort to the prediction process, this is an acceptable concession as our new method is fully automated. Next, we see that the coverage percentage of the Deep-Tracer beats Phenix by over 20%. However, it still lacks behind the C-CNN method by 3%. On the contrary, Phenix performs best for RMSD, beating the DeepTracer by 0.08 and the C-CNN method by 0.09. If we compare the DeepTracer to Phenix based on these two metrics, we can see that the coverage improvements significantly outweigh the small deterioration in RMSD. However, compared to the C-CNN method there is no significant difference regarding the RMSD and coverage. As mentioned in the introduction, we wanted to focus not only on the prediction accuracy, but also on the runtime of the predictions. And here we can discern immense differences. For the prediction of smaller structures. the C-CNN method took at least 20 minutes while the DeepTracer ran small predictions in a matter of seconds. However, the bigger implications lay in the prediction of larger proteins. For around 6000 atoms the C-CNN method took over 24 hours to finish, whereas the DeepTracer only needed around 20 minutes, for some even less than 5 minutes. Particularly, the trendline is interesting as it gives us an idea of how the methods will behave for very large proteins. The C-CNN trendline seems almost linear above 2000 predicted proteins and the runtime seems to quadruple when 6000 predicted atoms are reached. If this trend continues then we could expect a 75-fold runtime increase in order to predict 100,000 atoms. The runtimes of DeepTracer, however, seem to remain flat once a certain number of atoms is reached which would mean that very large proteins could be predicted within a reasonable runtime. This can be explained by the chain identification step that is applied before the prediction of any atom. While larger proteins consist of more chains than smaller ones, the number of atoms in the chains does not necessarily grow. As each chain is processed separately this means that if the chain lengths remain constant and only the number of chains gets larger the runtime grows linearly with the number of chains.",

We can see that the secondary structure prediction performs well with an average accuracy of 81.72%. We also show that deep learning could discern different types of amino acids based on the density maps. Particularly, as this is only the preliminary stage of predicting amino acid type directly from 3D cryo-EM density map. It gives promise for future improvements through a more elaborate training of the U-Net with more data. Furthermore, we plan to include the amino acid sequence as an input parameter, so that we can map the predicted sequence with the input sequence and refine our prediction. For this sequence mapping work, an amino acid type prediction accuracy of around 30% from 3D could be already helpful. Particularly, as we can see from Fig 12 that the U-Net tends to correctly predict the type of consecutive amino acids, likely due to high local resolutions. As it is very unlikely that this happens by chance, we can use this information to map the input sequence to our 3D backbone atom and amino acids prediction.",

In terms of accuracy, we were able to outperform the established structure prediction method Phenix by over 20% in structure coverage with only a slight RMSD increase of 0.08. Compared to the deep learning-based C-CNN method we achieved a slightly better RMSD by a margin of 0.01 with a slightly decreased coverage of 3%. In contrast with the C-CNN method, this fully automated method requires no manually set parameters. And the vastly reduced runtime allows us to predict protein structures within minutes instead of days. This is significant, as it allows the researchers to apply the DeepTracer on very large density maps and expect results maximally within a couple of hours. Furthermore, we achieved preliminary results in the amino acid type prediction from 3D with an accuracy of 25.2%. This gives promise to the incorporation of amino acid sequence into the prediction pipeline. Since the predicted amino acids from 3D could potentially be utilized for the reference of future full-atom structure prediction. In the future, we expect to use the amino acid type information to extend the functionality of the DeepTracer such that it can predict the protein full atom structure, including the side chains of the amino acids.",
