            "text": "Clinical research is most often conducted in an environment that is part of a larger health-care system. Both the conduct of clinical research and the practice of clinical medicine involve risk. The extent to which risk is present in the hospital environment has been well documented in recent years. The Institute of Medicine's groundbreaking report \"To Err is Human\" characterized the magnitude of the occurrence of medical errors during patient care in the United States, estimating that between 44,000 and 98,000 hospital-based deaths per year could be attributed to medical errors. 1 In more than 15 years since this report was released, multiple studies have provided supporting evidence for these staggering findings. 2 In a 2016 study by Makary and colleagues that analyzed medical death data from four studies conducted from 2000 to 2008, the authors estimated that more than 250,000 deaths each year in the United States result from medical errors. 3 In the study, authors highlighted that these results place medical errors third on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's list of leading causes of death in the United Statesdbehind the 611,105 deaths that are associated with heart disease and the 584,881 deaths attributable to cancer, and just above the 149,205 patients who die from respiratory diseases. Findings from a study by Van Den Bos et al. estimate that the annual cost of measurable medical errors, in 2008, was over $17 billion. 4 According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 2 million health careassociated infections occur each year; costing the United States an estimated $20 billion dollars. 5 A 2011 study by Magill and colleagues estimated the number of health care-associated infections to be 721,800. 6 These figures are unquestionably daunting; however, they do not include either the scores of near misses or latent errors (errors that never reach the patient or result in harm) or the system failures that influence a patient's healthcare experiences negatively. Based on these striking mortality and health care-associated infections data, the fact that the health-care environment is fraught with risks and potential errors that must be identified and deftly managed if patients are to be cared for safely and appropriately seems incontrovertible.",

            "text": "Murff et al. describe additional risks that rarely are considered formally during the review of a clinical research protocol, including the clinical environment in which the research will be conducted, as well as system failures that are inherently associated with clinical medicine. 7 The health-care environmentdwhether an inpatient unit, an ambulatory care clinic, or a community health centerdis a complex system that is influenced by multiple factors that contribute to, or mitigate, risk in the conduct of clinical research. Nolan describes a system as \"a collection of interdependent elements that interact to achieve a common purpose.\" 8 If one applies this definition to the clinical care environment, examples of interdependent elements that one might consider include such factors as the institution's culture (especially with respect to safety), the skill mix and competence of the staff, the availability of state-of-the-art equipment, and the quality of information systems, to name but a few. The health-care literature is rife with examples of system failures resulting in harm to patients; for example, significant medication errors (e.g., the death of the Boston Globe reporter, Betsy Lehman, who died of a massive chemotherapy overdose and the tragic loss of young Josie King), 9e12 wrong site surgeries that often top the Joint Commission's list of reported sentinel events, 13 and the relative epidemic of health care-associated infections. 6,14e16 Whereas any one of these events could be considered an error resulting from an individual provider's negligence, systems thinking compels us to consider these adverse events as failures in a series of interrelated and/or codependent processes or systems. In truth, in the current complex health-care environment such events almost invariably involve a series of missed opportunities to correct the errordhence they truly represent system failures. 14 This shift in focusdfrom the individual to the systemd forces organizations to broaden their analyses of incidents and, thereby, broaden the impact of any improvements. Because of the endemic nature of errors and system failures in clinical care, investigators and review bodies must collaborate with the health-care practitioners with whom they entrust their participants' safety to assure that the system/environment in which clinical research is conducted is safe and has the necessary infrastructure in place to support the study. Further, the research team must have strategies in place to monitor the clinical research environment to identify risks and clinical events that could contribute to adverse events and/or protocol deviations and to assure that processes are in place to prevent, mitigate, and manage risks.",

At that time, investigators at the NIH Clinical Center authored two protocols designed to gain insight into the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and natural history of this new disease as well as to assess strategies for the clinical evaluation and management of patients with SARS. These protocols perhaps positioned the NIH CC somewhat uniquely as one of the few health-care facilities in the world that was actively recruiting patients with SARS. The research protocols received rigorous scientific and human subject protections vetting and approval, and the principal investigators were poised to enroll their first participant/patient. However, several circumstances caused the NIH CC, as an organization, to pause before the decision was made to open recruitment.",

Further, at the time of the SARS outbreak, the NIH CC's clinical environment was in a buildingd constructed in the 1950sdthat posed significant infrastructural hurdles to providing safe care to patients infected with highly infectious (and in this instance, possibly airborne) pathogens. In this complex clinical context, investigators from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases submitted protocols requiring the provision of care for highly infectious SARS patients. Subsequently, these proposals were presented to the NIH community. As one might have anticipated, several investigators who provide care for patients who have severely compromised immune function were adamantly opposed to admitting patients with SARS or other highly contagious respiratory illnesses electively to the NIH CC. However, because of the clearly urgent public health need, as well as the potential unprecedented scientific opportunities, the leadership of the NIH CC approached the issue not by asking: \"Can we safely provide care to patients with SARS?\" but rather by asking the question, \"How can we care safely for all of our patients?\" As the protocols were being reviewed for human subjects' protection, the leadership of the NIH CC set out to identify the critical clinical functions that they felt must be present and operating at optimal levels to admit and care for SARS patients safely. This assessment required the collaboration of the research team, the leadership of the NIH CC, and the active participation of key clinical departments such as hospital epidemiology, nursing, critical care medicine, pharmacy, and housekeeping. Using flowcharting techniques, 17,18 the team carefully cataloged each step in the research process and identified clinical care functions necessary to support the research requirements. Clinical and operational functions that were identified as being essential to the successful care of these patients are outlined in Table 36.2. This exercise was eye-opening in that both the clinical care providers and the investigators were astounded by the breadth of hospital functions that required flawless orchestration to assure that the protocols could be implemented safely. Following the identification of the key clinical and operational requirements, a team was charged with assuring that appropriate policies, procedures, staff, equipment, and physical infrastructure were in place and functioning optimally and efficiently prior to the admission of the first SARS patient. The clinical care team worked closely with the research team as well as with the community of NIH investigators to assure alignment with the study requirements and to time, appropriately, the admission of the first protocol participant. \u2022 The frontline nursing, infection control, laboratory, transport, housekeeping and other ancillary staff were key members of the planning team from the beginning of the initiative. \u2022 Frontline staff were active participants at the daily leadershipled huddles. \u2022 A challenge was managing the well-intentioned \"directives\" of leadership staff who were removed from day to day bedside care but have a vested interest in the care of Ebola patients.",

As was the case with the SARS protocol, this process can be daunting. Focusing an organization's finite resources to assure that attention is paid to the most critical and potentially riskiest care processes is a challenge for most organizations. A variety of tools exist to guide the objective prioritization of what may ultimately be a very long list of critical issues that must be addressed. FMEA is a powerful risk assessment tool that provides a systems-based, human-factors-focused, and objective methodology for identifying and prioritizing risk, with the ultimate aim of reducing patient harm and enhancing clinical research. 19,21e28 Historically, FMEA has been used in the engineering environment to assess high-risk processes associated with power generation in the commercial nuclear power industry; in aviation to assess the acceptability of aircraft designs; and in the automotive industry to establish manufacturing requirements for cars and trucks. 19, 22, 24 DeRosier and colleagues at the Veteran's Administration's Center for Patient Safety are credited with moving the techniques of FMEA to the bedside, applying the concept of prospective risk analysis to health-care processes. 29, 30 In 2002, the use of FMEA in health care further expanded with the issuance of a Joint Commission requirement that all health-care organizations seeking accreditation conduct at least one proactive risk assessment on a high-risk clinical process every 18 months. 31 Clinical care practitioners as well as clinical research professionals can use FMEAs to identify risk and to avert adverse events, errors, and other system failures in a variety of health-care settings. 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 28 In a complex care environment, where risk is compounded by the interplay of clinical medicine and clinical research, FMEA is a useful tool to guide risk mitigation by identifying critical risk points in clinical care and clinical research processes. In 2016, investigators at the National Institute of Mental Health initiated a clinical research protocol at the NIH CC to study the neurobiology of suicide and to identify risk factors for short and long-term suicidality. One of the study phases involved admitting actively suicidal patients. In response to this research protocol, the NIH CC set in motion a rigorous risk mitigation initiative. An interdisciplinary team comprised of patient safety professionals, research investigators, nurses, social workers, and hospital leadership used FMEA to evaluate potential risk points throughout the clinical research and patient care processes. The analysis was facilitated using QI Path, an FMEA software package. The team segregated the research protocol into three overarching care delivery processes as well as several subprocesses for analysis as illustrated in Fig. 36.1 .",

FMEAs, or other risk assessments, identify process points that are associated with increased risk to the patient/participant, to involved providers, and/or to the scientific integrity of the study. As illustrated in the example above, these risks can be addressed by myriad clinical and organizational interventions that are aimed at reducing those risks. The next step in mitigating risk is the deployment of strategies to assess the effectiveness of interventions, and to survey the research and care environments continually for other risks to the participants and to the study. Measurement is fundamental to assessment efforts and improvement in the quality of care. The history of health-care quality improvement and measurement dates to Florence Nightingale's collection of mortality data and infection rates during the Crimean War, as well as to the work of Ernest Codman in establishing standards for hospitals in the early 1900s, including his provocative \"end results hypothesis\" that led to a Semmelweis-like estrangement from the health-care establishment (see Chapter 1). 32, 33 In a classic paper in 1968 Avedis Donabedian recommended measuring health-care quality in three areas: structure (the characteristics of a health-care setting); process (what is done in the health-care setting); and outcomes (the status of the patient resulting from specific interventions). 34 This paradigm remains the mainstay of modern health-care performance measurement programs and is the basis for the local, state, and federal programs designed to measure the quality of clinical care and identify health care-associated risks and adverse events. Clinical research programs, too, should implement processes to assess the performance of the clinical research enterprise systematicallydprimarily to assess for risks to the participants, investigators, and care providers, as well as for threats to the integrity of the study. Collecting and reporting adverse events that occur during the course of a research study is a mandatory component of both the research process and the protection of human subjects. However, event reporting in clinical research focuses on individual protocols, not on how the system of clinical research is performing as a whole. This \"protocolcentric\" focus fails to identify clinical care and clinical research system failures that potentially might impact participant safety across multiple studies. Murff and his colleagues 35, 36 have described the need for research teams to develop reporting systems that collect data about reportable adverse events, as well as \"near misses\" or \"latent failures\" in the clinical care and clinical research environments. Near misses or latent failures are errors that do not result in patient/participant harm; however, these events do have the potential to do harm if the circumstances of the event were somewhat different. Identifying and analyzing near misses or system failures provide the care and research teams the luxury of designing and implementing interventions to interrupt the error cycle prior to the occurrence of a serious error. Surveillance for errors, adverse events, and latent errors in the clinical care or research setting can be accomplished using a variety of strategies including 1 event reporting systems 2 ; electronic surveillance systems that utilize clinical triggers to identify errors; and 3 analysis of clinical performance measurement data.",

The reports indicated that drug delivery was delayed on several occasions because the infusion pumps had inexplicably suspended infusion. Each time the infusion would stop, the nursing staff would troubleshoot the problem, requiring the infusions to be restarted several times during a single delivery, potentially resulting in a delay of study drug administration, and potentially adversely affecting drug levels and pharmacokinetics. Alerted to these administration errors via the ORS, the Pharmacy Quality Officer met with the study investigators, the clinical care staff, and the nursing staff. Collectively the group conducted an intensive review of the events. The common factor identified in each incident was that the infusion pumps stopped due to an \"air in line\" alert, although no air was noted in the tubing. All efforts to determine the cause of the alert generation were futile. Finally, the team contacted the research team who had developed and conducted the initial laboratory testing of the drug in an effort to identify a reason for the alerts. Following the review of the current medication administration procedure for this study, the research team noted that the initial safety testing for the drug was performed using a different brand of intravenous tubing than the brand stocked and used in the NIH Clinical Center. The team changed the procedure for administering the study drug, mandating a change in the brand of intravenous tubing used. No additional reports of misadministrations were reported during the remainder of the study. Whereas these incidents do not appear to have caused any harm to the participant or the study, the potential for harm to the participant and the study are obvious, and any future potential adverse events or protocol deviations were averted as a result of identifying this series of events via the NIH CC's ORS.",

Electronic surveillance for adverse events has proven effective in identifying, in real-time, events such as adverse drug toxicities and interactions, health care-associated infections, and other iatrogenic injuries or events. This technology uses clinical triggers to signal the presence of potential errors or adverse events. Clinical triggers can include high-risk medications, select abnormal laboratory values (e.g., abnormal serum potassium levels, microbiology culture results), treatment interventions such as antidotes (e.g., Naloxone (Narcan), vitamin K), corrective procedures (e.g., chest tube insertions and dialysis) and unplanned intensive care unit admissions. 9,47e52 Electronic event surveillance for clinical care and clinical research errors and latent failures provides a tool that administrative institutional leadership, clinicians, and research investigators can use to identify, mitigate, and report these events in a much timelier manner than traditional, voluntary incident reporting systems.",

Table 36 .3 provides a list of frequently monitored processes of care. Performance measurement activity in the clinical research setting also should take into consideration important clinical metrics associated with the scientific protocol under study. In addition to national and state benchmarks for clinical performance metrics, clinical researchers should be mindful of the specific processes on which their studies depend and create appropriate performance metrics to track the success of those systems.",

Quantitative and objective data about the organization's health care-associated infection rates and hand hygiene practices provide valuable information about system and process issues that might need to be addressed prior to recruiting and enrolling patients/participants. Assuring that the clinical care environment in which clinical research participants will receive safe and high-quality care that supports clinical research is a shared responsibility of the health-care organization's leadership, the care providers, and the research team.

In 1995, the Clinical Center partnered with the Picker Institute (the National Research Corporation (NRC) acquired the Picker Institute in 2001) to develop a method of eliciting patient/participant feedback about critical aspects of their clinical research experience at the NIH CC. The Picker Institute's philosophy of eliciting information from patients about their experiences was used to develop the NIH CC's survey.
