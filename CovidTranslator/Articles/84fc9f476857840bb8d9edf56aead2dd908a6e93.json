            "text": "It has been proposed that autoimmune diseases result directly from dysregulation of the immune system or as a secondary consequence of microbial infection [1, 2] . Because of the promiscuity of TCRs and B cell receptors (BCRs), cross-reactivity between infectious agents and self antigens (molecular mimicry) is not rare, although such activities are better documented at the antibody level than at the T cell level. Recent evidence from animal models of autoimmune disease indicates that disease progression may be due to the activation and recruitment of autoreactive lymphocytes, regardless of the initiating event. These autoreactive lymphocytes are specific for epitopes that are distinct from and non-cross-reactive with the disease-inducing epitope, and resuh from chronic tissue damage (epitope spreading). Support for this hypothesis comes primarily from autoimmune models in which disease is induced with a defined autoepitope and responses to non-cross-reactive T-and/or B-cell epitopes on the same or different self proteins are assessed for pathological potential during disease progression. Induction of chronic tissue pathology by viruses also leads to epitope spreading. Epitope spreading has been demonstrated at the T cell level, particularly in relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE), in antibody-mediated disease models such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and in viral diseases including Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelineating disease.",

T cell proliferative and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to the secondary (PLP178-191) epitope, but not to the immunodominant (MBP84-104) epitope, are induced in SJL]J mice following the acute phase of both active and adoptive PLP139-151-induced R-EAE (intramolecular epitope spreading). Central nervous system (CNS) myelin damage is necessary for the initiation of epitope spreading. When induced following disease initiation but prior to the acute clinical episode, tolerance to the disease-inducing PLP139-151 epitope prevented the development of T cell reactivity to the PLP178-191 epitope, and the magnitude of PLP178-191-specific DTH responses correlated with the severity of CNS damage during acute disease [10\" ]. In addition, PLP139-151-specific T cell responses were activated in mice following acute tissue damage in MBP84-104-induced R-EAE (intermolecular epitope spreading). Intramolecular and intermolecular T cell epitope spreading has also been reported in SJL/J mice in which R-EAE was induced with a T cell line specific for an MBP exon-2 encoded peptide [11\u00b0] , and in B10.RIII mice primed with MBP89-101 [12\u00b0]. More recently, Yu et al. [13 \u00b0\u00b0] reported a predictable sequential epitope spreading cascade in (SWRxSJL)F 1 mice with R-EAE induced by the immunodominant PLP139-151 epitope. During disease progression, responses to PLP249-273 appeared first, followed by proliferation to MBP87-99, and then to PLP173-198.",

            "text": "The pathological contribution of epitope spreading to chronic R-EAE has been verified through the employment of several experimental approaches. Firstly, serial transfer studies have proven the encephalitogenic potential of responses to endogenous myelin epitopes. Splenocytes from mice in remission from PLP139-151induced active or adoptive R-EAE that are activated in vitro with the relapse-associated PLP178-191 epitope transfer R-EAE into naive recipients [10\u00b0\u00b0]. Similar success in the serial transfer of R-EAE by T cells activated with relapse-associated epitopes has been reported in SJL/J mice in disease that was initiated by T cell lines specific for intact MBP [8] or for an MBP exon-2 encoded peptide [11 \u00b0] and in (SWR\u00d7SJL)F 1 mice in disease that was initiated by PLP139-151 [13\" ]. Secondly, PLP178-191-specific T cells are demonstrable in the CNS of mice that are in remission from PLP139-151-induced R-EAE (CJ Vanderlugt, SD Miller, unpublished data). Most importantly, induction of tolerance to the intact PLP [10 \u00b0\u00b0] or to the relapse-associated PLP178-191 epitope, but not to the disease-inducing PLP139-151 epitope (Table 1) , protects mice that are in remission from acute PLP139-151-induced R-EAE from renewed disease progression. Similar results have been reported by Yu eta/. [13 \u00b0\u00b0] in (SWR x SJL)FI mice with PLP139-151-induced R-EAE in which disease progression is blocked by tolerance to MBP87-99. These reports verify our earlier report concerning adoptive MBP-induced R-EAE [14] , wherein during disease remission induction of tolerance to mouse spinal cord homogenate (a crude mixture of Table 1 myelin neuroantigens), but not to the disease-inducing MBP, ameliorated disease relapses. Lastly, we have shown that during remission [15\"\u00b0] , blockade of the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway by treatment of SJL/J mice with anti-B7-1 Fab fragments blocked the development of PLP178-191-specific DTH responses and disease progression in PLP139-151-induced R-EAE. Collectively, these studies provide conclusive support for a dominant role of responses to endogenous myelin epitopes in mediating disease relapses.",

            "text": "The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse serves as a spontaneous murine model of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, in which insulitis leads to the destruction of pancreatic 13 cells and consequently to clinical diabetes. T cell and B cell responses to 13 cell antigens arise spontaneously in NOD mice. It is generally believed that islet cell destruction is initiated by a Thl response against the 65 kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)65, which arises within four weeks of age, and, as the animals progress to overt diabetes, that T cell reactivity subsequently spreads to other pancreatic 13 cell antigens such as carboxypeptidase H, insulin, and heat shock protein 65 [17, 18] . This hypothesis is supported by reports that induction of neonatal tolerance to GAD65 via intrathymic [18] or intravenous [17] peptide injections blocked the activation of responses to other ~ cell epitopes and the subsequent development of insulitis and diabetes. More recently, Kaufman and co-workers [19 \u00b0\u00b0] have shown that intranasal administration of GAD65 induced a Th2 response characterized by an interleukin-5 dominant T cell response and the production of large amounts of GAD65-specific IgG1. More importantly, CD4 + splenic T cells from GAD65-treated mice protected NOD-severe combined immunodeficient mice from diabetes induced by the transfer of NOD T cells (40% late onset compared to 90% incidence in the controls) and also blocked the induction of proliferative responses to heat shock protein and insulin.",

[20\" ] used SmB peptide epitopes, immunodominant in human SLE, to induce an SLE-like syndrome including the development of antinuclear antibodies anti-DNA antibodies, thrombocytopenia, seizures and proteinuria in mice. These animals also developed autoantibodies that bound to other non-cross-reactive spliceosomal proteins. The authors hypothesize a role for B cell epitope spreading in which B cells directed against disease-initiating epitopes mediate antigen-specific uptake of large complexes leading to the efficient presentation of self epitopes from distinct proteins that make up the complexes. Autoantibodies to both components of the La/Ro ribonucleoprotein complex are seen in SLE and are a prominent feature of Sj6grens syndrome. Intramolecular epitope spreading was demonstrated by the induction of at, toantibodies to multiple nonoverlapping regions of La after immunization with the La A subfragment and intermolecular spreading was demonstrated by the appearance of anti-60kDa Ro IgG antibodies in mice immunized with mouse or human La [21\u00b0\u00b0]. Thus, the development of autoantibodies to multiple components of the La/Ro ribonucleoprotein complex follows the initiation of an immune response to a single component and epitope spreading is likely to account for the appearance of mixed autoantibody patterns in systemic autoimmune diseases.",

Responses to other epitopes on that molecule, which arise later or upon hyperimmunization, are termed secondary or cryptic. According to this hypothesis, an immune response targeting one or two dominant epitopes on a infectious agent is not sufficient. The immune system has evolved a mechanism, therefore, for increasing the number of epitopes targeted during an infection. This results in the appearance of a response against cryptic epitopes, but can also lead to autoimmunity via the activation of autoreactive T and/or B cells which would not have undergone central or peripheral tolerance. This hypothesis has concentrated mainly on the diversification of the immune response after priming with intact proteins, for example, MBP in R-EAE, wherein responses to the cryptic epitopes arise only following initial tissue damage.",

In brief, T cells specific for the initiating self or viral epitope induce the inflammatory cascade in the target organ, resulting in tissue damage. Tissue debris is taken up by macrophages and/or antigen-specific B cells and presented to naive tissue-specific T cells which, once activated, perpetuate the inflammatory response. This hypothesis is consistent with that of Elson et al. [34] , who propose that epitope spreading is a Thl-linked phenomenon linked to altered processing of self epitopes and with the hypothesis of Mamula and Janeway [35] , who suggest that antigen-specific B cells (I0 000-fold more efficient than other APCs) may be responsible for the diversification of autoimmunc responses. Model of epitope spreading in chronic T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. (a) Upon priming with the initiating self (1\") epitope in an appropriate adjuvant, Thl cells are activated in the peripheral lymphoid tissue. These Thl cells proliferate, upregulate appropriate homing receptors, traffic via the bloodstream to the blood-tissue barrier, and transmigrate (adhere and penetrate) into the target organ (b). The autoreactive Thl cells encounter antigen presented in the context of MHC class il by tissue-specific APCs triggering local secretion of chemokines and cytokines (\u00a2). These soluble mediators attract and activate peripheral monocytes (Mono) and macrophages (Me) and tissue-resident mononuclear inflammatory cells. The phagocytic activity of these activated macrophages along with the secretion of cytotoxic and proinflammatory molecules like TNF-o~, nitric oxide (NO), and 0 2 radicals cause self-tissue destruction (d) resulting in the expression of clinical symptoms. Tissue debris phagocytized by macrophages and/or B cells could be presented to naive T cells, which can traverse the compromised blood-tissue barrier, in the target organ and/or in the peripheral lymphoid tissue (e), leading to the activation and expansion of pathological T and/or B cells specific for self epitopes (2\") other than the initial disease-inducing (1\") epitope which mediate a second wave of tissue destruction.
