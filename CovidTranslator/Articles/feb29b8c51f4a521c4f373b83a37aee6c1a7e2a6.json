            "text": "Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is one of the main causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea. Several diagnostic assays have been employed to detect the presence of the virus in stool samples from calves. Despite this, the frequency of BCoV infection among Brazilian and even South American cattle herds has yet to be well characterised. This study describes the occurrence of BCoV infection among calves from dairy and beef herds in four Brazilian states. A total of 282 stool samples from 1 to 60-day-old calves were evaluated for the presence of BCoV by a semi-nested (SN) PCR assay. The animals were from herds (n= 23) located in three geographical regions in Brazil (south, southeast, and center-west). The specific BCoV amplicon was detected in 15.6% (44/282) of the faecal specimens examined, of which 95.4% (42/ 44) were from diarrhoeic and 4.6% (2/44) from asymptomatic calves. The specificity of the SN-PCR amplicons was evaluated by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The results show that the BCoV is widespread, mainly among calves from 16 to 30-days-old (p=0.0023), and verify the association between BCoV infection and clinical signs of diarrhoea (p=0.005). These findings emphasise the importance of this virus in enteric infections of Brazilian cattle herds.",

Several factors, either singly or in combination, may cause neonatal diarrhoea including environmental, managemental, nutritional, and infectious. Enteric infections may be caused by protozoa, bacteria and/or viruses. In calves, the viruses most commonly associated with neonatal diarrhoea are the group A rotavirus and coronavirus; it is not unusual for both viruses to concomitantly infect calves. Mixed infections might also occur between viruses and bacteria and/or protozoan Oliveira Filho et al. 2007) .",

The frequency of infection shows notable variation between different geographical regions, the production type (dairy or beef) of the evaluated herds, and diagnostic techniques. The highest rate of BCoV infection was reported in calves from Brazil (39%) and Ethiopia (38.9%) using HA/HI and ELISA assays, respectively (Abraham et al. 1992; Jerez et al. 2002) . In other countries from America, Asia and Europe, the frequency ranged from 4 to 15.6%, based mostly on the results of PCR assays (Reynolds et al. 1986; Snodgrass et al. 1986; De La Fuente et al. 1998; Khalili et al. 2006; Park et al. 2007 ). In Brazil, only a few studies have evaluated the BCoV occurrence in stool samples from calves (Jerez et al. 2002; Takiuchi et al. 2006; Oliveira Filho et al. 2007) . The rates of infection measured ranges from 16 to 39%; however, the occurrence of BCoV infection has not been well characterised, since the number of evaluated faecal samples examined was relatively low in all these studies. Furthermore, the stool samples were collected from only one region and the animal management conditions were also different, making it difficult to establish a comparison and to draw conclusions about the overall BCoV infection frequency among Brazilian cattle herds.",

In the present study, the overall rate of BCoV infection among 1 to 60-day-old calves in four Brazilian states was 15.6% out of a significant number (n=282) of stool samples that were analysed by an SN-PCR assay. This data reveals that BCoV is widespread among Brazilian dairy and beef cattle herds, at least among younger animals, as diarrhoea is among the most important health problems that afflicts calves. As the technique (SN-PCR) employed for the diagnostic assay was reported to be more sensitive than other assays such as antigen-capture ELISA, the frequency rate presented in this study more accurately reflects the actual infection rate of the Brazilian cattle herds (Cho et al. 2001) . Furthermore, the primers used in this study were designed based on a highly conserved region of the N gene, which is the most abundant protein found in infected cells. The N RNA is also abundant and thus diagnosis based on the RNA is sensible as it represents a good marker for BCoV infection (Hiscox et al. 2001; Takiuchi et al. 2006) .",

Since the HA test was performed directly on faecal specimens, the non-specific hemagglutinins present in the faeces may cause false-positive results justifying this higher rate of BCoV infection (Sato et al. 1977) . Moreover, in this previous study, only dairy herds (n=16) were included, which does not necessarily reflect the overall rate of BCoV infection among Brazilian cattle herds. Another study performed only on faecal samples from calves with diarrhoea also presented a higher infection rate (24%) than that reported in this study. Since the previous study used the SN-PCR assay with the same primers and conditions, the higher reported frequency may be justified by the low sampling used that did not necessarily reflect the actual infection rate of BCoV among calves from Brazilian herds .",

The present study shows similar results, since 16 to 30-day-old calves showed a significantly higher (p=0.0023) frequency of infection when compared to the other age groups evaluated. Similar results were also described, with a higher rate of viral shedding, in 15 to 18-day-old calves (Jerez et al. 2002) . The association between calf age and BCoV infection was probably due to the decreasing levels of antibodies acquired from the colostrum. The frequency of infection among diarrhoeic calves in the other age groups was very similar (Table 2 ), but higher than that found in the control group (asymptomatic calves), which showed a BCoV infection rate of 3.3%. This result shows that calves of up to 60 days of age, when infected with BCoV, frequently develop the clinical symptoms, even with some passive immunity in the first week of life or natural resistance that acquires significant levels at 30 days of age.",

The rate of BCoV infection in diarrhoeic calves herein presented (19.0%) was similar. Surprisingly, when comparing only results from stool samples taken from calves of up to 30 days of age from both studies, the BCoV frequency rate of infection was slightly higher than the rate of group A rotavirus infection determined by the previous study (28.3 and 26%, respectively). In this way, the BCoV infection must also be considered an important neonatal enteric disease since it was present at a similar frequency as rotaviruses and caused diarrhoea in most of the cases. The four Brazilian states included in this study were also evaluated in the rotavirus study, which makes the comparison more accurate.",
