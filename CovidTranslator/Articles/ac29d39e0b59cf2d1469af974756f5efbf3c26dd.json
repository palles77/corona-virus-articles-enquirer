In addition, involvement of XBP-1 in host cell-virus interaction and transcriptional regulation of viruses, such as human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), has been revealed recently. Two XBP-1 isoforms, XBP-1U and XBP-1S, which share an identical N-terminal domain, are present in cells. XBP-1S is a transcription activator while XBP-1U is the inactive isoform. Although the transactivation domain of XBP-1S has been identified within the XBP-1Sspecific C-terminus, molecular mechanism of the transcriptional activation by XBP-1S still remains unknown. Here we report the interaction between p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and XBP-1S through the C-terminal domain of XBP-1S. No binding between XBP-1U and PCAF is detected. In a cell-based reporter assay, overexpression of PCAF further stimulates the XBP-1S-mediated cellular and HTLV-1 transcription while knockdown of PCAF exhibits the opposite effect. Expression of endogenous XBP-1S cellular target genes, such as BiP and CHOP, is significantly inhibited when PCAF is knocked down. Furthermore, PCAF is recruited to the promoters of XBP-1S target genes in vivo, in a XBP-1S-dependent manner. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PCAF mediates the XBP-1Sdependent transcription through the interaction with XBP-1S.",

            "text": "INTRODUCTION X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) belongs to the cyclic AMP response element binding protein/activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF) family of transcription factors. XBP-1 plays a major role in regulating unfolded protein response (UPR), which is triggered when endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is under stress (1) . XBP-1 has two protein isoforms, XBP-1U and XBP-1S. Both isoforms share a common N-terminus containing a basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) domain which is required for DNA binding. XBP-1U is the dominant isoform under non-stress conditions. Activation of UPR induces the endoribonuclease activity of inositol requiring enzyme 1, an ER transmembrane protein, which removes 26 nts from the open-reading frame of XBP-1 mRNA (2) . This unconventional splicing occurs in cytoplasm and causes a frame shift at amino acid 165 of XBP-1, leading to the generation of XBP-1S by replacing the C-terminus of XBP-1U with a strong transactivation domain (2, 3) . XBP-1S is a transcription activator that up-regulates the expression of ER chaperones and other genes involved in membrane synthesis and the pathway of protein secretion (4, 5) . Overexpression of XBP-1S increases the secretory capacity of the cell and improves recombinant protein productivity in secretion-limited mammalian cells by expanding the surface area and volume of ER (5, 6) . It has been shown recently that high-level expression of recombinant secreted proteins in cells and environmental stresses during culture also induce the generation of XBP-1S (7) . XBP-1S is also found to be essential in the terminal differentiation of the antibody producing plasma cells by enhancing the secretory machinery of the cell (8, 9) . The XBP-1-knockout B cells display impaired immunoglobulin secretion, which can be restored by ectopic expression of XBP-1S (8) . Furthermore, the involvement of XBP-1 in tumorigenesis has been reported recently (10) (11) (12) .",

            "text": "Recent studies show that cellular UPR can be induced by infection of various viruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (13) , West Nile virus (14) , Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (15) , hepatitis C virus (16, 17) , human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (18, 19) , dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN-2) (20) , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (21) , coronavirus (22) , Epstein-Barr virus (23) and Semliki Forest virus (24) . Some viruses, such as JEV and DEN-2, use the ER of host cells as the primary site of glycoprotein synthesis, genomic RNA replication and virus particle maturation, and thus trigger ER stress as well as UPR (15, 20) . In the other case, some viral proteins, such as HCMV US11, traffic to the ER of host cells and induce UPR (18) . The transactivator of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Tax, has been shown to be localized in the organelles associated with protein secretion including ER and Golgi complex (25) , raising the possibility that HTLV-1 may affect cellular UPR as well. We previously discovered that XBP-1S stimulates basal and Tax-activated transcription of HTLV-1. Infection of HTLV-1 was found to induce UPR and up-regulation the expression of several UPR genes, including XBP-1. Furthermore, XBP-1 was identified as one of the Tax target genes in cells (26) . Our results not only revealed a positive feedback loop between HTLV-1 and the host cells, but also suggested an important role for XBP-1 in transcriptional regulation of HTLV-1.",

The GL3 siRNA, which specifically targeted the GL3 luciferase used in the HTLV-Luc and BiP-Luc reporters, was used as a positive control and caused 90% decreases in luciferase expression under the control of HTLV and BiP promoters ( Figure 4B and C, the second and third transfections). The two PCAF siRNAs inhibited 40% luciferase expression driven by HTLV promoter, while no significant effects were caused by either p300 siRNA ( Figure 4B ). Similar observations were found in the BiP-Luc reporter assays ( Figure 4C ). Results obtained from the PCAF overexpression and knockdown reporter assays (Figures 3 and 4) demonstrate the functional involvement of PCAF in the genes regulated by XBP-1S.",

Extopic expression of PCAF significantly activated the Luc expression driven by the wild-type BiP promoter, while little or no effects were detected on the transcription driven by the ERSE-mutant BiP promoter ( Figure 5A) . Since the protein level of endogenous XBP-1S was low in the ER stress-free cells, only up to a 44% increase in BiP transcription was observed ( Figure 5A ). In the XBP-1Soverexpressing cells, PCAF exhibited stronger activation on the expression of luciferase driven by the wild-type BiP promoter ( Figure 5B, up to 3-fold) . However, no activating effects on the ERSE mutant BiP promoter were detected when both PCAF and XBP-1S were overexpressed ( Figure  5B ).

Cells were transfected with a control or PCAF shRNA followed by the treatment of Tm to induce UPR. The mRNAs isolated from the cells were analyzed by QRT-PCR. The mRNA levels of BiP and CHOP increased 4-and 14-fold, respectively, after Tm incubation ( Figure 8A ). Knockdown of PCAF only led to minor inhibition on the transcription of the two genes ( Figure 8A ). An identical set of assays was performed using Tg as the UPR inducing reagent. Little or no significant effects on BiP and CHOP mRNAs were detected in the PCAF shRNA-transfected cells ( Figure 8B) . We further carried out quantitative ChIP to examine the distribution of XBP-1S and PCAF on BiP and CHOP genes during UPR. Incubation of Tm resulted in 15-and 5-fold increases in XBP-1S binding to BiP and CHOP promoters, respectively, while only 3-and 1.7-fold increases in PCAF associating with the two genes ( Figure 8C ).

Two HATs, PCAF and p300, have been shown to interact with Tax and play a role in Tax-activated viral transcription (26, (33) (34) (35) . Tax, which does not bind to DNA by itself, activates HTLV-1 transcription through three 21-bp repeats known as TRE, located within the promoter of HTLV-1. Each 21-bp TRE repeat contains a CREB/ ATF binding site and is known to associate with CREB/ ATF family proteins (36, 37) . Tax binds to TREs through the interaction with CREB/ATF family proteins (including XBP-1S, CREB1 and CREB2) and recruits PCAF/p300 to HTLV-1 promoter, resulting in Tax transactivation (26, (33) (34) (35) . We previously found that XBP-1S bound to Tax and induced stronger Tax transactivation than other CREB/ATF family proteins (26) . Interestingly, XBP-1S also stimulated basal transcription of HTLV-1, while CREB1 and CREB2 did not show any activating effects, suggesting a crucial role for XBP-1S during the early phase of viral transcription as well (26) . No interaction between PCAF and CREB1 was detected in Co-IP analyses ( Figure 1A ). This observation could explain why CREB1 and other CREB/ATF family proteins fail to up-regulate HTLV-1 transcription in the absence of Tax. In contrast, the requirement for PCAF in the XBP-1S-dependent HTLV-1 basal transcription was clearly demonstrated in the cell-based reporter assays ( Figures 3A and 4A) .",

In addition, quantitative ChIP assays showed that XBP-1S recruited PCAF to the promoters of endogenous XBP-1S target genes in vivo, establishing direct functional connection between PCAF and XBP-1S ( Figure 7) . However, knockdown of PCAF by siRNA or shRNA did not completely inhibit the elevated transcription caused by XBP-1S (Figures 4 and 6 ). There are two possible explanations for these observations. First, both siRNA and shRNA against PCAF did not completely block the protein synthesis of PCAF ( Figures 4A  and 6A ). Therefore, it is possible that the siRNA-and shRNA-transfected cells still have sufficient PCAF left to participate in the gene activation by XBP-1S. Secondly, PCAF may be one of the cellular co-factors responsible for XBP-1S-dependent transcription. Therefore, elimination of PCAF by RNA interference could only partially inhibit the transactivation of XBP-1S.",

PCAF has been identified as a co-factor of ATF4 (or CREB2) for the expression of CHOP (38) . In response to amino acid starvation, ATF4 binds to the amino acid response element located in the CHOP promoter and recruits PCAF to the promoter, leading to the activation of CHOP transcription (38) . Besides PCAF, ATF4 also interacts with other HATs, including p300 and CBP, through its N-terminal transactivation domain (39, 40) . As shown in Figure 1 , XBP-1S shows more stringent protein binding than ATF4 and fails to associate with p300. Future study is required to investigate the interaction between XBP-1S and other HATs to further determine the binding specificity of the XBP-1S transactivation domain. Collectively, Figure 8 . Requirement of PCAF for the mediation of XBP-1S target genes under UPR. MCF7 cells were co-transfected with a non-specific (i.e. control) or PCAF shRNA, and incubated with 10 mg/ml Tm (A) or 300 nM Tg (B). Both Tm and Tg were dissolved in DMSO and the final concentration of DMSO in the culture was kept at 0.1%. Expression of endogenous BiP and CHOP genes was determined by QRT-PCR. Cells transfected with a control shRNA with 0.1% DMSO were served as a negative control. For quantitative ChIP assays, HEK293 cells were treated with 10 mg/ml Tm (C) or 300 nM Tg (D) and the bindings of XBP-1S and PCAF to the endogenous BiP and CHOP genes were analyzed by quantitative PCR. Cells incubated with 0.1% DMSO were used as a negative control. Fold changes were determined by comparing to the negative controls. *P < 0.05 versus negative controls. Figure 9 . Interaction between XBP-1S and PCAF under UPR. 293T cells were transiently transfected with a XBP-1S expression vector and incubated with 10 mg/ml Tm or 0.1% DMSO (i.e. the negative control) for 16 h. IP was performed using the cell lysates prepared from the transfected cells and the antibody against XBP-1. Normal IgG (IgG) was used as a negative control. The immunoprecipitated complexes and the protein inputs were analyzed by western blotting. the findings by our and other groups point out that PCAF may play an important role in transcriptional activation of CHOP through the XBP-1S-as well as ATF4-dependent pathways.",

Co-overexpression of p300, YY1 and ATF6 showed synergistic activation of luciferase expression driven by the BiP promoter, suggesting that p300 might be required for YY1-/ATF6-mediated activation of BiP (41) . Similar cell-based reporter assays (i.e. using the BiP-Luc reporter plasmid) were performed to determine the requirement of p300 for XBP-1S-mediated transactivation. Neither overexpression nor knockdown of p300 showed any significant effects on XBP-1S-dependent luciferase expression (Figures 3 and 4) , suggesting that p300 might function in a XBP-1S-independent manner. These results were further supported by Co-IP data, in which no interaction between p300 and XBP-1S was detected ( Figure 1C ). Furthermore, we assessed the requirement of p300 for transcriptional activation of BiP and CHOP genes under UPR. In contrast to the report by Baumeister et al. (41) , our results obtained from the quantitative ChIP analyses did not show any increased p300 binding to either BiP or CHOP promoters in the Tm-or Tg-stressed cells (data not shown), raising the questions regarding to the involvement of p300 in the regulation of XBP-1S target genes.",

However, results from QRT-PCR and quantitative ChIP showed that PCAF only exhibited limited involvement in the expression of XBP-1S target genes when UPR was induced ( Figure 8) . A recent study identified the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) as a novel XBP-1S binding protein and demonstrated that the association between XBP-1S and the PI3K subunit could be UPR-dependent (32) . We examined the XBP-1S-PCAF protein-protein interaction under the normal or Tm-stressed conditions. As shown in Figure 9 , the interaction between XBP-1S and PCAF was not disrupted during UPR. On-going research focuses on the identification of the XBP-1S co-factor(s) required for the transactivation caused by XBP-1S once UPR is induced. GCN5, a HAT which shares 73% identity in amino acid sequence with PCAF (42), is a possible candidate for XBP-1S binding partner. The involvement of GCN5 in XBP-1S-dependent transcription and during UPR is currently under investigation.",

Recent studies show the involvement of XBP-1 in tumorigenesis of various cancers and suggest XBP-1 as a potential target for anti-cancer therapeutics (10) (11) (12) 43) . Fujimoto et al. investigated the expression of XBP-1 in 11 primary breast cancers and five breast cancer cell lines, including MCF7. The increased expression of XBP-1 was detected in all breast cancers and cell lines examined, but not in the non-cancerous breast issue (44) . In addition, clinical results showed that high levels of XBP-1S increased the survival of breast cancers (45) . Our data presented here demonstrate the functional importance of PCAF in mediating the expression of XBP-1S target genes in MCF7 cells (Figures 6 and 7) , suggesting a potential role of PCAF in XBP-1S-mediated tumerigenesis of breast cancers. Furthermore, PCAF may be an essential factor for other XBP-1S-mediated signaling pathways. For example, XBP-1S is one of the key components in the transcriptional program controlling plasma cell differentiation (1) .
