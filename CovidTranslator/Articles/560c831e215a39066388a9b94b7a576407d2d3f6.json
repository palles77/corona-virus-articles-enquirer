The outcomes of outbreak simulations on networks are driven both by the underlying epidemic model, and by the networks' structural properties, so that the same pathogen can generate different epidemic dynamics on different networks. Here we ask whether there are general properties that make a contact network intrinsically vulnerable to epidemics (that is, regardless of specific epidemiological parameters). By conducting simulations on a large set of modelled networks, we show that, when a broad range of network topologies is taken into account, the effect of specific network properties on outbreak magnitude is stronger than that of fundamental pathogen features such as transmission rate, infection duration, and immunization ability. Then, by focusing on a large set of real world networks of the same type (potential contacts between field voles, Microtus agrestis), we showed how network structure can be used to accurately assess the relative, intrinsic vulnerability of networks towards a specific pathogen, even when those have limited topological variability. These results have profound implications for how we prevent disease outbreaks; in many real world situations, the topology of host contact networks can be described and used to infer intrinsic vulnerability. Such an approach can increase preparedness and inform preventive measures against emerging diseases for which limited epidemiological information is available, enabling the identification of priority targets before an epidemic event.",

In a typical implementation of epidemic models, nodes can be in one of three different states at any given time: susceptible to the infection, S; infected, I; and recovered/removed from the system, R (following complete immunization or death). Different epidemic models are then formulated by varying the rules that permit hosts to transition from one state to another. For example, a very common model is the SI, where nodes can pass only from S to I. In the SIS models, infected nodes are allowed to roll back to the susceptible state without gaining immunity (I \u2192 S) according to a certain probability, which enables a disease to cycle in a host population by re-infecting individuals that have recovered from a previous infection. Simulating individuals gaining permanent or temporary immunity requires the addition of a third compartment that sees nodes removed from the network (I \u2192 R), which creates more complex models, such as the SIR and the SIRS (note that, besides immunization, the R status may indicate the death of a node) (Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015) .",

Nevertheless, even in the case of similarly structured networks, topological properties still permit an accurate assessment of relative network vulnerability towards a given class of pathogens (i.e. to pathogens whose spread can be modelled using similar epidemic parameters). These findings can help improve preparedness when limited epidemiological information is available and a fast response (for example in terms of prioritization) is needed, a situation that is expected to become ever more common in the future, due to the growing globalization, and the rapid emergence of new diseases.",

Due to the purely theoretical nature of this study, the choice of the R i function is arbitrary. This formulation of R i , however, permits a smooth transition from situations where the probability of recovery increases very slowly with time (when \u03c1 is close to 0), to opposite scenarios of fast recovery (when \u03c1 is close to 1). It is intuitive that the concept behind the SNES model allows for maximum flexibility in the choice of R i (t) function, making it possible to accommodate specific situations.

Interestingly, analogies can be drawn for very different contexts, such as that of information spread in social networks. The probability that a person will share a piece of information will rapidly decrease when receiving the same piece of information again.

Additionally, the SNES model can also be easily adapted to more specific scenarios. For example, the addition of a simple rule controlling the lapse between the time a node is infected and the time it becomes infectious enables the SNES to emulate compartment models that include latency (such as the SEIRS, which includes an 'exposed' class).",

To grow each network, we selected at random a model between four different wellknown ones (configuration model; Erdos Renyi, ER; Barabasi-Albert, BA; and Watts-Strogatz, WS) (Strogatz, 2001) . To build networks using the configuration model (B\u00e9k\u00e9ssy et al., 1972) , we selected a random exponent for the power law degree distribution varying between 2 and 3. In ER networks we set the number of nodes (V) to a random integer in [50, 500] and the number of edges to a random integer in [V, 1000] . In BA networks, we set the number of nodes to a random integer in [500, 1000] , and the number of outgoing edges generated for each node to (V \u00d7 r \u00d7 0.01 + 1), with V being the number of nodes, and r being a random real number in [0, 1]. In WS networks, we set the dimension of the lattice to 1, the size of the lattice along all dimensions to a random integer in [50, 250] , the distance within two nodes are connected to a random integer in [2, 10] , and the rewiring probability to a random real number in [0, 1] . In this way, we obtained networks with a good variation in number of edges, nodes, connectance, clustering, and diameter ( Fig. 1 ).",

Thus, we generated all networks as directed and simple (that is without loops and reciprocal links), and then we added reciprocal links until reaching a preselected degree of reciprocity, extracted at random in [0, 1] (with 0 corresponding to a directed network with no reciprocal links, and 1 corresponding to an undirected network).",

In the original study (Davis et al., 2015) , captures were performed at each of the four sites using 100 traps placed at the nodes on a regular grid of 5 m 2 square cells. Trapping sessions were carried out every 28 days from March to November, and every 56 days from November to March (please refer to Davis et al., 2015 for a more complete description of the methodology and additional details). Starting from the raw data, which included a unique identifier for each field vole individual caught in a trap at least once, as well as the time (day) and location (node in the trap-grid) of capture, we built networks of potential contacts between voles by linking all individuals caught in the same cage, or in two neighbouring cages (i.e. at a distance smaller than 5 m), on the same day. We then retained only the networks including at least 100 edges. In this way, we built 296 networks, with relatively small variability in their structural properties (much smaller than that observed in the set of simulated networks, see Fig. 2 ).",

Although this measure was developed in a completely different context (in particular, to assess the resilience of a network against node removal), it is also closely related to the concept of percolation, which has fundamental implications for studying epidemics ( Bogun\u00e1, 2006) . In its original formulation, R was computed by removing nodes in decreasing order of their degree (i.e. their number of connections). The aim of sequentially removing nodes with the largest degree is to speed up the process of network disassembly, hence obtaining a conservative estimate of robustness in the worst case scenario of node removal. However, it has been pointed out that other criteria going beyond local properties (such as node degree) could offer more efficient ways to disrupt networks (Morone and Makse, 2015) . Thus, we used PageRank (Page et al., 1999) to determine the order of node removal in the computation of R. Nevertheless, we also tested the sensitivity of R as a measure of intrinsic vulnerability (see section 2.10) to different criteria of node removal (namely, node degree and betweenness).",

In simulated networks, the magnitude of epidemic outbreaks (Fig. 3) was well explained by the combination of epidemic parameters and by network properties (Table 1) . Surprisingly, topological properties, and particularly the density of infection pathways (quantified by network connectance), and their redundancy (quantified by network clustering, that is how often two nodes pointing to another one are linked, and by network robustness, see below) had a stronger effect on outbreak magnitude than the epidemic parameters when a broad range of network topology is considered (Fig. 4) . Network robustness (R) resulted also more important than epidemic parameters (and the second most important factor). This result was very consistent in two different scenarios where we assumed, respectively, that all nodes had the same susceptibility to infection (0.5), or a random susceptibility extracted from a normal distribution with mean 0.5 and standard deviation 0.1. This suggests that outbreak magnitude is driven by average susceptibility more than by its variation across individuals. Thus, we report and discuss here only the results referring to the first scenario.",

Transmission rate (\u03c4) emerged as the most important factor, although both network robustness and network connectance had very strong effects (much higher than those of \u03c1 and \u03b9). The other network parameters were less relevant, and their effects were not always consistent with those observed in the set of simulated networks.

On the one hand, it indicates that the networks where a potential outbreak is predicted to be strongest will also be the most difficult to protect, since having a high R complicates immunization procedures based, for example, on targeted vaccination (Morone and Makse, 2015) . On the other hand, it suggests that R's ability to synthesize various aspects of network structure in a single value might make it a useful index to rank networks on the basis of their intrinsic vulnerability, thereby offering a way to prioritize preparedness efforts by focusing preventive and surveillance actions on the most vulnerable networks. This idea was supported by our experimental results, which confirmed the Unique Robustness Measure, R as an efficient measure of intrinsic network vulnerability. In particular, the rank of field vole networks according to R was very consistent with the rank obtained by ordering networks on the basis of their vulnerability in a broad range of epidemic scenarios, that we modeled by running a set of classical SIR models (Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015) under different combinations of infection/recovery probabilities ( Fig. 6 ; adjusted R-squared: 0.59, p < 0.00001, regression line y = 0.77x + 0.12). We quantified vulnerability in terms of the total fraction of nodes reached by the infection throughout the epidemic simulation (see Fig. 3 -II). This result is particularly convincing when considering the limited topological variability of the field vole contact networks (see Fig. 2 ), which makes them a challenging benchmark to test the sensitivity of R as a vulnerability measure. Using different criteria of node removal to compute R (namely, node degree and betweenness) led to very consistent results (adjusted R-squared: 0.60, p < 0.00001, regression line y = 0.78x + 0.11 when node degree was used; adjusted R-squared: 0.61, p < 0.00001, regression line y = 0.78x + 0.11 when node betweenness was used).",

            "text": "Simulated Real It should be highlighted that, in some cases, the structure of the network used to model a particular outbreak includes some implicit information about a pathogen's behavior, such as its transmission mode. For example, one will use a network of sexual contacts to model the spread of HIV within a community (Woodhouse et al., 1994) , or a spatial network mapping crop distribution to model a plant pest spread (Strona et al., 2017) , or again the air transportation network for describing airborne pathogens (Brockmann and Helbing, 2013) . On the one hand, in such cases, looking at the pathogen and at the network as two separate entities would not be straightforward. On the other hand, however, the issue is more philosophical rather than applicative, since it does not prevent us from comparing network vulnerability both between and within broad classes of pathogen transmission strategies. Furthermore, it depicts more scenarios where our findings could be very useful. For example, one may generate different networks within the same context by considering different possible pathogen transmission strategies. Those could be either general ones, such as airborne or sexual transmission, or very specific strategies taking into account, for instance, vector vagility (Strona et al., 2017) . Then, one may compare the structure of such networks in order to identify their relative risk towards different kinds of pathogens. Fig. 4 . Effects of network structural properties and epidemiological parameters (\u03c1, \u03b9, and \u03c4) on outbreak magnitude measures for both the experiments on random and real-world networks. The area of squares represents the absolute value of canonical loadings, which represent the relative importance of independent variables in determining outbreak magnitude (see Methods), with white and black squares indicating, respectively, positive and negative values. For simulated networks we report both results for all aggregated networks, and the results for the different kinds of networks. Since in both simulated and real-world networks the amount of variance in the set of dependent variables explained by that of independent variables was consistent in the first dimension, but not in the second one (see Table 1 ), we focus here on the loadings of the first canonical dimension. The graph was generated using the table.value function from the R package adegraphics (Dray and Siberchicot, 2017) . Conn: network connectance; SR: spectral radius; Diam: network diameter; Clust: network clustering; R: network robustness; \u03c4: pathogen's transmission rate; \u03c1: duration of infection (i.e., survival time of the pathogen in the host); \u03b9: pathogen's immunization effect on hosts over repeated infections. Our results are consistent with (and complementary to) previous studies that have shown how network structure can profoundly affect infectious disease dynamics (Keeling, 2005) , and that taking this aspect into account may improve our ability to understand and predict epidemic patterns, and to implement intervention measures (Keeling and Eames, 2005) . For example, the properties of the air-transportationnetwork have been identified as a main determinant of global patterns of emerging diseases, with complex features of the airline network being at heart of the global spread dynamics of diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (Colizza et al., 2006) . In addition, a more recent study showed that measuring the distance between the source and the target of an infection in network space can provide a more reliable prediction of epidemic spread rate than geographical distance, regardless of the nature of the disease (Brockmann and Helbing, 2013) . Consistent with those ideas, our findings suggest that, in the face of many unmeasurable unknowns related to epidemiological parameters, focusing on network properties can facilitate the identification of vulnerabilities and the optimization of existing systems. Fig. 6 . The Unique Robustness Measure (R) as an index of network vulnerability to epidemic spread. The efficiency of (R) in ranking networks according to their vulnerability towards an unknown epidemic threat was evaluated by comparing the rank of the face-to-face contact networks (Isella et al., 2011) according to their R with their respective rank measured as the fraction of nodes reached by the infection in 100 different SIR scenarios (see Methods).
