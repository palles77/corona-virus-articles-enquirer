            "text": "Members of the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family inhibit the entry of a wide range of viruses. Viruses often exploit the endocytosis pathways to invade host cells and escape from the endocytic vesicles often in response to low pH. Localization to these endocytic vesicles is essential for IFITM3 to interfere with the cytosolic entry of pH-dependent viruses. However, the nature of the sorting signal that targets IFITM3 to these vesicles is poorly defined. In this study, we report that IFITM3 possesses a Yxx\u03a6 sorting motif, i.e., 20-YEML-23, that enables IFITM3 to undergo endocytosis through binding to the \u03bc2 subunit of the AP-2 complex. IFITM3 accumulates at the plasma membrane as a result of either mutating 20-YEML-23, depleting the \u03bc2 subunit, or overexpressing \u03bc2 mutants. Importantly, blocking endocytosis of IFITM3 abrogates its ability to inhibit pH-dependent viruses. We have therefore identified a critical sorting signal, namely 20-YEML-23, that controls both the endocytic trafficking and the antiviral action of IFITM3. This finding also reveals that as an endocytic protein, IFITM3 first arrives at the plasma membrane before it is endocytosed and further traffics to the late endosomes where it acts to impede virus entry.",

            "text": "Humans have five IFITM proteins, known as IFITM1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 (Siegrist et al., 2011) . IFITM5 is only expressed in osteoblasts and participates in bone mineralization and maturation (Moffatt et al., 2008) . The function of IFITM10 remains unknown (Hickford et al., 2012) . IFITM1, 2 and 3 all respond to stimulation by type I interferon (Lewin et al., 1991) , and inhibit many viruses including IAV, flaviviruses (West Nile virus, dengue virus), filoviruses (Ebola virus, Marburg virus), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), SARS coronavirus, reovirus, Rift Valley fever virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (Brass et al., 2009 , Lu et al., 2011 , Chan et al., 2012 , Huang et al., 2011 , Schoggins et al., 2011 , Anafu et al., 2013 . The in vivo importance of IFITM3 in antiviral defense is demonstrated by the much higher mortality and morbidity of ifitm3knockout mice upon IAV infection as compared to the wild type mice (Everitt et al., 2012 , Bailey et al., 2012 . In addition, the hospitalized IAV patients showed significant enrichment of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ifitm3 gene that impairs the anti-IAV function of IFITM3 (Everitt et al., 2012 , Zhang et al., 2013 , although an association of this SNP with mild influenza but not severe H1N1 infection was also reported (Mills et al., 2013) . One mechanism of this in vivo role of IFITM3 is that its expression protects the lung resident memory CD8(+) T cells from infection by influenza viruses as well as from subsequent virus exposures (Wakim et al., 2013) .",

An inhibition of membrane fusion by IFITM was shown by the reduction of cell to cell fusion that is mediated by the envelope proteins of IAV and JSRV as well as other class II and III fusion proteins . This inhibition of cell fusion is rescued by a lipid analog known as oleic acid that confers negative membrane curvature and promotes membrane hemifusion, suggesting that IFITM proteins impede the creation of hemifusion . The underlying mechanism may involve decrease in membrane fluidity , which is supported by an elevation of cholesterol in multivesicular bodies and late endosomes as a result of IFITM3 interaction with VAPA (Vesicle-membrane-protein-associated protein A) and consequently the dissociation of VAPA from the cholesterol sensor OSBP (oxysterol-binding protein) (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "IFITM proteins inhibit viruses that enter cells at different subcellular sites. Among these viruses under IFITM inhibition, HIV-1 entry is pH-independent and is generally believed to occur at the plasma membrane (Blumenthal et al., 2012) . VSV and IAV are pH-dependent viruses, but require different pH optima to trigger viral membrane fusion. VSV entry occurs at pH 6.2 in the early endosome, whereas the membrane fusion of IAV takes place at pH 5.5 in late endosomes and lysosomes (Vazquez-Calvo et al., 2012) . In order to inhibit these diverse viruses, IFITM proteins need to be present at these various portals of virus entry. Indeed, in addition to endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are synthesized and modified, IFITM1, 2 and 3 are also located at the plasma membrane, endosomes and lysosomes, albeit at different levels (Yount et al., 2012 , Yount et al., 2010 , Feeley et al., 2011 , Huang et al., 2011 . Currently, it is largely unclear what is the trafficking itinerary of IFITM proteins between these cellular membrane compartments, what signals control IFITM trafficking, and how the signaling mechanisms regulate the antiviral action of IFITM proteins. In addition to the roles of palmitoylation and ubiquitination in modulating the subcellular localization of IFITM3 (Yount et al., 2010 , Yount et al., 2012 , a key role of the Y20 residue in this regard has also been reported (John et al., 2013 , Jia et al., 2012 . Yet, the mechanism behind this role of Y20 has not been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we provide evidence that IFITM3 bears a tyrosinebased classic sorting signal, 20-YEML-23 of which Y20 is located, that enables IFITM3 to undergo endocytosis and is essential for IFITM3 to inhibit viruses. Although the sorting function of 20-YEML-23 per se is not a surprise, our results demonstrate IFITM3 as an endocytic protein and more importantly, this property is essential for IFITM3 to inhibit pHdependent viruses that enter cells via endocytosis.",

To demonstrate this, we first tried to detect cell surface IFITM3 by immunostaining. The N-Flag IFITM3 (with a Flag tag added to the N-terminus) was expressed in HEK293 cells followed incubating the cells with anti-Flag antibody on ice for 30 min. We washed off the unbound antibodies, fixed the cells and imaged for cell surface IFITM3. No apparent fluorescence signal was detected from intact non-permeabilized cells, although the presence of intracellular IFITM3 was shown by the results of staining the detergent-permeabilized cells (Fig. S1 ). Similarly, the N-Flag YLAA mutant was undetectable on the cell surface with the anti-Flag antibody staining, although this mutant was clearly located at the plasma membrane (Fig. S1 ). This result suggests that the N-terminal region of IFITM3 is located within the cytoplasm, which is consistent with the published data (Yount et al., 2012 .",

In contrast to the N-Flag IFITM3, the C-Flag version was readily detected on the cell surface with anti-Flag antibody staining at 4\u00b0C, suggesting extracellular exposure of the C-terminal sequence of IFITM3 (Fig. 1C ). Not surprisingly, the C-Flag YLAA mutant was also detected on the cell surface with anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 1C) . We then performed the antibody uptake experiments by switching the cells to 37\u00b0C for 15 min following incubation with anti-Flag antibody on ice. The anti-Flag antibody-bound C-Flag IFITM3 was detected inside the cells and co-localized with the endocytosed transferrin (Fig. 1C) . However, the C-Flag YLAA mutant remained at cell periphery, suggesting a defect in endocytosis (Fig. 1C) . To validate this observation, we added a different tag, the Myc tag, to the N-or C-terminus of IFITM3 and performed the same antibody uptake and immunostaining experiments. Again, the C-Myc IFITM3, not the NMyc form, was detected by the anti-Myc antibody at the cell surface, and the C-Myc IFITM3/anti-Myc antibody complex was internalized following incubation at 37\u00b0C (Fig. S2A, S2B) . In order to validate the imaging data showing the luminal/extracellular exposure of the C-terminus of IFITM3, we used flow cytometry to score the cells that were stained with the anti-Myc antibody either under the non-permeabilization condition (cell surface expression) or the permeabilization condition (total expression). Equal numbers of positively stained cells were measured for C-Myc IFITM3 regardless the cells were permeabilized or not, as opposed to the N-Myc IFITM3 whose cell-surface expression was seen in less than 20% of IFITM3expressing cells (Fig. 1D) . Our data support the model that IFITM3 is a type II transmembrane protein .",

Five AP complexes have been discovered among which AP-1, 2, 3 and 4, are well characterized (Bonifacino et al., 2003 , Hirst et al., 2011 . Each AP has one \u03bc subunit except for AP-1 and AP-3 that have two isoforms of \u03bc. To determine which of these \u03bc subunits recognizes the 20-YEML-23 motif in IFITM3, we expressed the Flag-IFITM3 along with each of \u03bc1A-Myc, \u03bc1B-Myc, \u03bc2-Myc, \u03bc3A-Myc, \u03bc3B-Myc, or \u03bc4-Myc. The \u03bc-Myc proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, and the presence of IFITM3 in the precipitated materials was examined in Western blotting. The results showed that IFITM3 was coimmunoprecipitated with the \u03bc2 subunit, but not evidently with other \u03bc subunits tested (Fig.  3A) . To demonstrate that this interaction is mediated by the 20-YEML-23 motif, IFITM3 mutants with changes in this peptide motif were tested for coimmunoprecipitation with \u03bc2. None of these mutants was associated with the \u03bc2 subunit (Fig. 3B ). We noticed that the IFITM3 mutants, except for Y20F, migrated slower than the wild type, which may result from altered protein folding and/or loss of modification at Y20. We further tested two \u03bc2 mutants, WR/AA and FD/AS in which the Yxx\u03a6-binding pocket are mutated (Carvajal-Gonzalez et al., 2012) . Again, we did not observe any interaction of these two mutants with wild type IFITM3 (Fig. 3C) . Together, these data demonstrate a YEML-dependent interaction between IFITM3 and the \u03bc2 subunit. This specific interaction may either result from the frequent trafficking of IFITM3 from the plasma membrane to the endosomes and/or the high affinity of the YEML motif for the \u03bc2 subunit. Our data do not completely exclude the possible weak interactions of IFITM3 with other \u03bc subunits. In support of this possibility, it has been shown that, in spite of the high affinity of the YEVM motif of the lysosomal protein CD63 for the \u03bc3 subunit, mutating \u03bc3 mislocalizes CD63 to the plasma membrane, which reveals the interaction of YEVM with \u03bc2 in the absence of wild type \u03bc3 (Rous et al., 2002) .",

We first examined the effect of the two \u03bc2 mutants WR/AA and FD/AS on the subcellular distribution of IFITM3. In contrast to the ectopic expression of the wild type \u03bc2 subunit that did not affect the intracellular localization of IFITM3, the WR/AA and FD/AS mutants caused accumulation of IFITM3 on cell periphery, likely as a result of disrupting the function of endogenous AP-2 complex (Fig. 4A) . We next knocked down \u03bc2 with siRNA oligos (Fig. 4B ) and examined how cellular distribution of IFITM3 was affected. The results showed that \u03bc2 knockdown effectively blocked the endocytosis of transferrin (Fig. 4C) . The same \u03bc2 siRNA treatment led to the accumulation of IFITM3 at cell periphery (Fig. 4C) . Although none of the four siRNA oligos completely depleted endogenous \u03bc2 (Fig. 4B) , internalization of transferrin and IFITM3 was drastically reduced, which suggests that the level of \u03bc2 is a key determinant of endocytosis efficiency. We extended this study to knock down \u03bc2 in HeLa cells, and observed that, concomitant with the blockade of transferrin endocytosis, the endogenous IFITM3 was re-located from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4D) . Taken together, we conclude that the \u03bc2 subunit of AP-2 complex is functionally required for the endocytosis of IFITM3.",

We then challenged these HEK293 cells with IAV (A/WSN/33 (H1N1)), and assessed virus infection by measuring the levels of IAV proteins NP, M2 and HA by Western blotting. A drastic decrease in the levels of NP, M2 or HA was observed in IFITM3-expressing cells as compared to the control cells (Fig. 5A) . In contrast, similar levels of IAV infection were observed in both control cells and cells expressing IFITM3 mutants (Fig. 5A) . The loss of IAV inhibition by these IFITM3 mutants is not due to their poor expression because they were expressed as well as the wild type IFITM3 (Fig. 5A) . We further assessed the anti-IAV activities of wild type IFITM3 and its mutants using various doses of IAV for infection and scored the viral NP-positive cells by flow cytometry. With the lowest dose of IAV that infected 13% of cells, IFITM3 reduced the number of infected cells by 17-fold, whereas the Y20A, L23A and YLAA mutants exhibited a 3-fold inhibition (Figs. 5B, S3). At the highest dose of viruses that infected over 90% of cells, IFITM3 still strongly inhibit IAV infection, as opposed to the Y20A, L23A and YLAA mutants that completely lost their inhibitory effects (Figs. 5B, S3) .",

Again, mutating YEML disabled IFITM3 from inhibiting VSV G and Ebola GP-mediated infection (Fig. 5C) .

In order to test whether this sequence divergence affects the antiviral activity of IFITM3, we exchanged the Yxx\u03a6 motif between human IFITM3 (YEML) and mouse IFITM3 (YERI), and determined how this change affects their ability to inhibit IAV infection. Both the wild type and mutated IFITM3 proteins were expressed at similar levels except that the YEML motif diminished protein migration on the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6B) . Nevertheless, such an exchange in Yxx\u03a6 motif did not affect the anti-IAV abilities of either human IFITM3 or mouse IFITM3 (Fig. 6C, 6D) , suggesting that they are functionally interchangeable.",

            "text": "Results of this study suggest that the 20-YEML-23 motif of IFITM3 acts as a functional protein-sorting signal through interacting with the \u03bc2 subunit of the AP-2 complex and allows IFITM3 to undergo endocytosis (Fig. 7) . Given that many viruses exploit endocytosis to enter cells (Mercer et al., 2010) , trafficking along the endocytosis pathway provides IFITM3 with the opportunity to encounter and inhibit these viruses (Fig. 7) . Regardless whether the virus hijacks the clathrin-dependent or clathrin-independent endocytosis route (Mercer et al., 2010) , the endocytosed vesicles ultimately fuse with endosomal compartments and deliver their cargos, including the internalized viral particles, to late endosomes and lysosomes where the majority of IFITM3 molecules are located (Feeley et al., 2011) . This subcellular localization allows IFITM3 to interfere with the entry of diverse viruses that enter cells via different endocytosis pathways. Because different viruses penetrate cellular membranes at different intracellular sites, some in the early endosomes such as VSV, while others in the late endosomes/lysosome such as IAV and EBOV (Fig. 7 ) (Vazquez-Calvo et al., 2012) , the extent of susceptibility to IFITM3 restriction likely vary among different viruses. One interesting example is the resistance of arenaviruses to IFITM3 restriction, which likely results from their entry via a clathrin-and caveolin-independent endocytosis pathway (Brass et al., 2009) . Subcellular localization and trafficking of IFITM3 can be influenced by post-translational modifications. Three types of post-translational modifications have been reported for IFITM3. The first is S-palmitoylation at cysteines 71, 72 and 105 (Yount et al., 2010) . Mutating these cysteines do not affect the localization of IFITM3 at ER, but diminishes membrane-binding and clustering properties of IFITM3. As a result, IFITM3 antiviral action is abrogated (Yount et al., 2012 , John et al., 2013 . The second is ubiquitination at lysines 24, 83, 88 and 104 with K24 as the major acceptor for ubiquitin (Yount et al., 2012) . As opposed to S-palmitoylation, eliminating IFITM3 ubiquitination by mutating these lysine residues promotes localization of IFITM3 to late endosomes and concomitantly enhances IFITM3's antiviral activity (Yount et al., 2012) . One possible explanation is that ubiquitination at K24 occludes the recognition of the proximal 20-YEML-23 sorting motif by \u03bc2 subunit of the AP-2 complex and thus impairs IFITM3 endocytosis (Fig. 7) . Lastly, the Y20 amino acid is phosphorylated by the Fyn tyrosine kinase (Jia et al., 2012) . Given that tyrosine phosphorylation in the Yxx\u03a6 motif hinders the recognition by \u03bc2 and consequently impedes AP-2-dependent endocytosis (Bonifacino et al., 2003) , it is likely that Y20 phosphorylation serves as a mechanism for cells to regulate the endocytosis efficiency and the subcellular localization of IFITM3.",

Deleting the first 21 amino acids prevents IFITM3 from inhibiting VSV and IAV (Everitt et al., 2012 . This loss of virus inhibition can be recapitulated by mutating only Y20 (Jia et al., 2012 , John et al., 2013 . In addition, a SNP rs12252-C of IFITM3 is significantly enriched in hospitalized patients who suffered from seasonal and pandemic influenza H1N1/09 viruses (Everitt et al., 2012 , Zhang et al., 2013 . This SNP causes aberrant splicing of IFITM3 mRNA and creates an IFITM3 mutant lacking the first 21 amino acids. Discovering 20-YEML-23 as a functional sorting signal provides the molecular mechanism behind the key role of Y20 in IFITM3 antiviral activity that was reported in the above studies. It is noted that IFITM1 does not bear the YEML motif, yet it still exerts antiviral activity. We postulate that its C-terminal sequence, which bears an YHIM motif, may control IFITM1 trafficking and antiviral function.",

Two other membrane topologies of IFITM3 were previously documented. One model stipulates that IFITM3 is a dual-pass transmembrane protein with luminal/extracellular existence of both N-and Ctermini. This model is supported by the results of cell surface immunostaining and flow cytometry experiments showing the detection of the Flag tag attached to the N-terminus of IFITM3 . The second model describes IFITM3 as an intramembrane protein with both termini projecting toward the cytoplasm. In support of this latter membrane topology, none of the putative glycosylation sites within the distal N-or Cterminal region of IFITM3 is modified (Yount et al., 2012) . Furthermore, the K24 residue in the N-terminal region is ubiquitinated, which can only occur when K24 is exposed to the intracellular E3 ligases. Our results support the cytoplasmic residence of the N-terminal region of IFITM3, since cell surface staining with anti-Flag or anti-Myc antibody barely detected these N-terminal tags. In the meantime, we were able to readily detect, at the cell surface, the Flag or the Myc tag that was added to the C-terminus of IFITM3, which supports the luminal/extracellular exposure of the C-terminal region of IFITM3 (Fig. 7) . In further support of the luminal residence of the C-terminus of IFITM3, appending an ER retention signal, KDEL, leads to ER sequestration of IFITM3 . Moreover, the C-terminus, but not the N-terminus, of IFITM3 is subject to lysosomal degradation . While more studies are warranted to reconcile these different observations, it is possible that the topologies of IFITM3 on membranes may be dynamic in nature, which depend on the different post-translational modifications in different cell types.",

(A) IFITM3 and its YEML mutations. The 20-YEML-23 motif is highlighted in boldface letters. The un-filled boxes denote the two putative membrane domains. (B) Effect of mutating the YEML motif on cellular localization of IFITM3. HEK293 cells were transfected with IFITM3 or its YEML mutants, then fed with Alexa 555-conjugated transferrin at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min prior to fixation. IFITM3 proteins were stained with anti-Flag primary antibody and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. DAPI was used to stain nuclei. (C) IFITM3 undergoes endocytosis. HEK293 cell expressing C-Flag IFITM3 or the YLAA mutant were incubated with anti-Flag antibody at 4\u00b0C for 30 min in the presence of Alexa 555-conjugated transferrin. Cells were either fixed directly and stained with anti-Flag antibody (cell surface expression) or switched to 37\u00b0C for 15 min to allow internalization of IFITM3/anti-Flag antibody complex (antibody uptake). The internalized complexes were then visualized by staining with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. To visualize the total IFITM3 or YLAA mutant (total expression), cells were permeabilized with 0.2% saponin prior to immunostaining with anti-Flag antibody. For wild type IFITM3, two exposures of the same image are presented to show the relatively weak staining at the plasma membrane. Representative images are shown. (D) Cell surface expression of the N-and C-termini of IFITM3. HEK293 cells were transfected with the N-or C-Myc IFITM3 and the YLAA mutant DNA. Half of the cells were incubated with anti-Myc antibody at 4\u00b0C to stain the Nor C-terminus of IFITM3 at the cell surface. The other half were fixed and permeabilized with 0.2% saponin, followed by anti-Myc antibody staining for the total expression of IFITM3. Myc-positive cells were scored by flow cytometry. The ratios of Myc-positive cells between the cell surface staining and the total expression staining were calculated to determine the relative cell-surface exposure of the N-and C-termini of IFITM3. The averages of three independent experiments are summarized in the bar graph. Dynasore and CPZ block IFITM3 endocytosis. HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-IFITM3-Flag plasmid DNA. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with dynasore (160 \u03bcM) (A) or CPZ (20 \u03bcg/ml) (B) for different periods of time, followed by immunostaining Flag-IFITM3. After treatment with dynasore or CPZ, cells were also incubated with Alexa 555-conjugated transferrin (5 \u03bcg/ml) at 37\u00b0C for 10 min to monitor the effectiveness of these treatments on endocytosis. Subcellular localization of Flag-IFITM3 was determined by staining with anti-Flag antibody. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Representative images are shown. IFITM3 interacts with the \u03bc2 subunit of AP-2 complex. (A) Coimmunoprecipitation of IFITM3 with the \u03bc subunits. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmid DNA expressing Flag-IFITM3 and Myc-tagged \u03bc subunits. Myc-\u03bc proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, followed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (B) Coimmunoprecipitation to examine the association of \u03bc2 with IFITM3 mutants that had the YEML sequence altered. (C) Co-immunoprecipitation to detect the interaction of IFITM3 with \u03bc2 mutants WR/AA and FD/AS that bear mutated Yxx\u03a6-binding pocket. Sizes of protein markers (in kDa) are shown on the left side of each Western blot. Effect of modulating \u03bc2 level on subcellular distribution of IFITM3. (A) The \u03bc2 mutants WR/AA and FD/AS were ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells together with Flag-IFITM3. Cellular localizations of Flag-IFITM3 (pseudocolored as green) and \u03bc2 mutants (pseudocolored as red) were determined by staining with anti-Flag and anti-Myc antibodies, respectively. DAPI was used to stain nuclei. Representative images are shown. (B) HEK293 cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides targeting \u03bc2. Levels of endogenous \u03bc2 were measured by Western blotting with anti-\u03bc2 antibody. Tubulin was probed as an internal control. Sizes of protein markers (in kDa) are shown. (C) Depletion of \u03bc2 causes accumulation of Flag-IFITM3 at the plasma membrane. HEK293 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting \u03bc2 and IFITM3 plasmid DNA. Localization of IFITM3 was determined by staining with anti-Flag antibody. Transferrin internalization was used to monitor the effect of \u03bc2 knockdown on endocytosis. (D) Effect of \u03bc2 knockdown on subcellular distribution of endogenous IFITM3 in HeLa cells. The endogenous IFITM3 was detected with anti-IFITM3 antibody. The endocytosis efficiency was monitored by measuring the internalization of transferrin. Representative images are shown. Mutating the YEML motif diminishes the capacity of IFITM3 to inhibit viruses. (A) IAV was used to infect HEK293 cells that stably express IFITM3 or its mutants with altered YEML sequence. Eight hours after infection, cells were lysed and the levels of IAV proteins NP, M2, and HA were determined by Western blotting. Anti-Flag antibody was used to probe the ectopically expressed IFITM3 and its mutants. Sizes of protein markers are shown on the left side of the Western blots. (B) Diffrerent doses of IAV were used to infect the IFITM3-expressing HEK293 cell lines. Eight hours after infection, the infected cells were fixed and stained with anti-NP antibody followed by flow cytometry analysis to score the infected cells. Results shown are the average of three independent infections. The original flow cytometry data are presented in supplemental Figure S3 . (C) Effects of wild type IFITM3 and its mutants on infections that were mediated by VSV G protein, Ebola virus GP, and the 10A1 protein of MLV. The IFITM3-expressing HEK293 cells were infected with the MLV-GFP reporter viruses that were pseudotyped with VSVG, EBOV GP or 10A1 proteins. GFP-positive cells were scored by flow cytometry 40 hours after infection. Results shown are the average of three independent experiments. The p-values were calculated between the data of wild type IFITM3 and those of IFITM3 mutants, the numbers are below 0.05 for infections mediated by VSV G and EBOV GP. Effects of different Y-motifs on the antiviral activity of IFITM3. (A) Conservation of the YEML-like motif in IFITM3 proteins from different species. The consensus sequence of this Y-motif is shown. (B) hIFITM3-YERI contains the YERI motif from mouse IFITM3 (mIFITM3), mIFITM3-YEML has the YEML motif from human IFITM3 (hIFITM3). HEK293 cell lines were generated to stably express these IFITM3 proteins. pQCXIP is the empty retroviral vector and was used to produce the control cell line. Expression levels of IFITM3 proteins were determined by Western blotting. Sizes of protein markers are shown on the left side of the Western blots. (C) The IFITM3-expressing HEK293 cell lines were infected with IAV. Cells were collected 8 hours after infection, then immunostained for viral NP protein. The positive cells were scored by flow cytometry. Results of three independent infections are summarized in the bar graph shown in (D).",

Following its synthesis at the ER, IFITM3 traffics to the plasma membrane where its 20-YEML-23 motif interacts with the \u03bc2 subunit of AP-2 complex and undergoes clathrindependent endocytosis. Ubiquitination of K24 is shown. C71/72/105 are palmitoylated. This trafficking mechanism positions IFITM3 on the endocytic pathway that many viruses utilize for cell entry. Examples of these viruses are VSV, IAV and EBOV. MLV is a pHindependent virus. VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; IAV, influenza A virus; EBOV, Ebola",
