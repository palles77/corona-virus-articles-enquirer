For influenzas, antivirals enable treatment of infected individuals and chemoprophylaxis of exposed individuals throughout the first wave until vaccines are developed. Non-pharmaceutical interventions may also delay local transmission and mitigate the impact of local epidemics [1] . Although A/H5N1 is predominantly a disease of domestic fowl [2, 3] and rarely occurs among humans, its very high mortality rate and high potential for mutation to readily transmit between humans remain of great concern. In contrast, A/H1N1 is highly contagious among humans but has in most cases a relatively benign clinical profile and low mortality rate [4] .",

Most relevant studies are cross-sectional and of the 26 studies recently reviewed 23 lacked robust theoretical frameworks [10, 11] . Several theoretical models for understanding health protective behaviours are available, including the cognitively based Theories of Planned Behaviour (TPB) [16, 17] / Reasoned Action (TRA) [18, 19] , Health Belief Model (HBM) [20, 21] and Protection Motivation Theory [22] . Although HBM and TPB among others have been applied in some studies of cognitive interactions with health protective behaviours during RIDs [15, 23, 24] , these models do not adequately accommodate affect in health behavioural change during RID epidemics/pandemics. Moreover, existing theories have poorly accommodated the spectrum of social influence, exceptions being the TPB/ TRA, which include coercive influences from family and friends under \"norms\", and Social Learning Theory (SLT) [25] , which describes observational learning. Neither theoretical position includes both. Some studies have explored combinations of different theories. For example, attempts to predict hand-washing on an intensive care unit by combining SLT and TPB elements found only self-efficacy predicted hand-washing [26] , suggesting established theoretical models may be inadequate. Because outbreaks of RIDs are dynamic, embodying significant uncertainty and often, invisible personal threat they differ from non-communicable disease. That the source of threat is not one's own behaviour but other people argues for social factors to be more influential than existing models of behaviour change allow.",

To enable individual determination of risk, information on threat characteristics relative to self is needed. Trust is a core element in risk perception [12] and influences perceived veracity of information from different sources. During epidemics, trust in information becomes important when people consider making informed decisions to change behaviour [27] . The public is usually passively exposed to epidemic-related information from government agencies via the media but more active searching may occur if perceived threat levels are high and imminent [28] . Trust in information is associated with health protective behaviour adherence during epidemics [11, [13] [14] [15] 23] , but observing the actions of others also provides information [25, 29] . In particular, during conditions of high uncertainty, for example during the early stages of an epidemic, people may seek information from a much broader array of sources, including observations of the actions of peers and affiliates (social learning) and from cautionary tales (cultural learning) if government/media information is lacking, inadequate, incomplete or unreliable [8, 30] . Existing theoretical models poorly integrate such broader social influences with affective and cognitive elements.",

Awareness of RID epidemic (and other) situations arise from perceptions, comprehension and prediction of the prevailing (threat) environment [34, 35] , being informed by both formal information (government/media news) and informal information (conversations or observation of the behaviour of friends, colleagues and others) sources. Such situation awareness subsumes several cognitive elements: Information is sought on the nature of the threat and protective actions because threat-related primary and secondary appraisal requires cognizance of threat characteristics and response options (causal knowledge, perceived susceptibility and utility of and effectiveness of protective response options) [34] and control of negative affect, which influences judgments of threat and action effectiveness [34] [35] [36] [37] . These elements of situational awareness offer potentially useful insights for predicting lay protective health behaviours during emerging RID epidemics [33, 38] . We developed and tested a theoretical model ( Fig. 1 ) derived from the above literature incorporating three domains: trust in both formal and informal information sources, situation awareness (causal knowledge; perceived effectiveness of PHP (effectiveness); perceived susceptibility to and worry about influenza) and reported recent PHPs (Fig. 1) . The model proposes that information trust influences situation awareness variables, which in turn influence PHPs. We used structural equation modelling to test a saturated (all paths between all variables are assumed) model as the null hypothesis. We hypothesized that greater trust in formal information would reflect elements of situational awareness embodying greater knowledge of disease, greater perceived PHP effectiveness, lower perceived susceptibility and less worry. This would be associated with enhanced PHP. In contrast, trust in informal information would reflect elements of situational awareness embodying less knowledge of disease, lower perceived PHP effectiveness, greater perceived susceptibility and worry, and uncertain PHP.",

Four and three items comprised assessment of personal hygiene practices for A/ H5N1 and A/H1N1, respectively. Each item was scored on a 4-point categorical scale (\"Always\", \"Usually\" \"Sometimes\" and \"Never\"). Scores for all three items were combined and the total score was used as a latent variable of PHP for the purposes of structural equation modelling. Using CFA factor loadings ranged between 0.55 and 0.75 for A/H5N1 items and 0.62-0.74 for A/H1N1 items.",

Sample characteristics for the two surveys were compared with the general population using Cohen's effect sizes [43] . Relevant data from each survey operationalizing domains specified in the conceptual model ( Fig. 1) were entered into the Structural Equation Model (SEM). Multivariate outliers were identified and deleted based on relative contribution to normalized multivariate kurtosis (nonnormality). SEM requires continuous data with multivariate normal distribution. This was estimated using Mardia's coefficient [44] . Missing data were handled with multiple imputation [45] to generate ten datasets which were summarized into one for subsequent analysis, to maintain sample size and maximize available data [46] . Standardized parameters (\u03b2) were estimated based on the summarized datasets. Standardized parameters >0.10 accompanied by p values \u22640.05 were considered as meaningful; Standardized parameters <0.10 but accompanied by p values \u22640.05 were considered weak and not meaningful. Those with associated p values \u22650.05 were non-significant. Misfitting or poorly fitting models were re-specified guided by theoretical soundness and the Lagrange Multiplier test (LMtest) which tests if the addition of (specified) parameters (paths) improves model fit and the Wald Test (Wtest) which identifies parameters that can be removed without reducing the model fit [47] .",

The latter path being consistent with previous findings that worry mediates the relationship between perceived susceptibility and health protective behaviours [52, 53] . Both paths enhance the interaction of situational awareness variables in the model. Both paths were added and the SEM reiterated using Wtests to optimally parse the model by removing any unnecessary paths.

Mediation analysis of these paths using the method of Barron and Kenny [54] found trust in formal information association with perceived prevention effectiveness was partially mediated by causal knowledge only for A/H1N1 data (without knowledge mediation \u03b2=0.42; with mediation \u03b2=0. 35 , where a decline in the value of \u03b2 on inclusion of the putative mediating variable (\"with mediation\") indicates degree of mediation (~17%)). Association between trust in formal information and PHPs was strongly mediated by perceive prevention effectiveness (without perceived prevention effectiveness mediation \u03b2=0.13; with mediation \u03b2=0.05 (n.s.),~61% mediation) for A/H5N1, but far less so in the case of A/H1N1 (without mediation \u03b2=0.24; with mediation \u03b2=0.20,~17% mediation). Perceived susceptibility mediation between trust in informal information and worry was absent in A/H5N1 data and marginal (without mediation \u03b2=0.46; with mediation \u03b2=0.41,~11% mediation) in A/H1N1data.",

The null hypothesis of a fully saturated model was rejected in favour of a parsed final model partially approximating to that hypothesized. PHP variance was consistently explained by perceived PHP effectiveness, which in turn was associated with trust in formal information. However, counter intuitively, causal knowledge, while consistently associated with reported PHPs only associated with trust in formal information for A/H1N1 data. Counter to what was hypothesized, perceived susceptibility was unrelated to trust in information and reported PHP, being only associated with influenza worry, which itself contributed to PHP variance only for A/H5N1 data. Trust in formal/informal information explained significant variance in influenza worry only for A/H5N1. Otherwise, the hypothesized model showed good fit to different data sets, from different times and influenza types. Variability in influenza characteristics probably contributed to differences in the model path weights. Despite A/H5N1, having a high case-fatality-rate [55] , no deaths were attributed A/H5N1 in Hong Kong since 2002. Primarily a poultry disease, urban dwellers fear A/H5N1 [56, 57] , liking it to SARS [56, 58, 59] . Rural dwellers, being familiar with zoonoses are less concerned [56, 57] . In contrast, A/H1N1 is perceived as a mild non-threatening event in Hong Kong [40] .",

We found similar differences but remain unsure why such differences exist, or what they mean, examining these in more detail elsewhere [56, 57, 60] . We incorporated elements from TPB (perceived effectiveness) and from HBM (knowledge, perceived susceptibility), and incorporated negative affectivity (worry), which many theoretical models exclude. Trust in informal information was strongly correlated with age in both datasets, but level of disease worry was higher for A/H5N1 than for A/H1N1 while levels of perceived susceptibility were comparable for both influenzas and showed age trends probably reflecting differential influenza experience. In both cases, trust was marginally higher in A/ H1N1 than A/H5N1 data, probably reflecting historical factors. Following SARS trust in government was low and this took time to recover. Age-related differences were also found, with older people reporting more trust, consistent with other studies [11] . Given that perceived risk varies by demographic factors for crime [61] , roads [62] , cancer [63] and infection [26, 64] , with more complex gender interactions seen on closer scrutiny [65] our findings are unsurprising.",

While most studies on perceived PHP effectiveness report a link with practice, some studies have not found this [15] . Additionally, we found perceived PHP effectiveness strongly mediated trust in formal information associated with reported PHP in A/H5N1 data, but only weakly mediated this association in A/H1N1 data. This suggests differences in influenza characteristics and/or historical changes in perceptions of PHP effectiveness since A/H5N1. Established patterns of PHPs may have been unaffected by additional formal messages for PHP for A/H1N1. Various PHP elements may be differentially influenced by message characteristics [60] .

Chinese culture considers social conformity to be important, so monitoring the behaviour and attitudes of others may provide important threat-related information to inform decision-making. Perhaps epidemic disease-related worry remains low until peoples' observations of others' statements and behaviours indicate action is warranted, arousing a motivating affect and hence behavioural response [33] . However, a strong disease worry link to better personal hygiene was seen only for A/H5N1, consistent with previous studies [56, 57] .

A greater proportion of women in the A/H5N1 sample inflating known demographic differences in risk perception and PHPs may account for some of the reported associations in the A/H5N1 dataset. However, variable means of the two samples were not markedly dissimilar (Appendix Table 3 ). Being crosssectional, causal direction is ambiguous. Some variables measured with single items are sub-optimally defined, possibly raising validity and reliability concerns, the alpha values are low for some constructs and the variance accounted for is relatively modest for both models. Reporting of PHPs may have been inflated, subject to social desirability and retrospective recall biases. This needs to be borne in mind when interpreting the findings.",

However, improvement in knowledge may be the most important consequence of trust in formal/informal information. During uncertainty, trust in formal information may modulate disease-related worry less than might the activities and beliefs expressed by trusted peers, family and perhaps even strangers. An example is face-mask use, which being highly visible takes on a semiotic function [8] . To generate a critical mass of appropriate behaviour in the community, prompt, clear and evidence-based public health information should help to maximize formal information trust [13] .",

During the A/H1N1 survey, when A/H1N1 was still confined to North America, these sources addressed Hong Kong governmental containment responses to the outbreak. In contrast to the then somewhat familiar A/H5N1, A/H1N1 was an unknown, apparently aggressive human strain. Different media coverage, the hangover from SARS, and public health education on PHP since 2003 [69, 70] likely influenced trust in formal information and improved influenza knowledge. Perceived susceptibility was apparently insignificant in this process, contrary to earlier findings [11] . Difference between datasets suggests that real or perceived epidemic/pandemic characteristics might significantly modulate PHPs. The geographic proximity and imminence of epidemic threat should therefore be considered as an influence in future studies of RIDs. New preventive knowledge is more likely to be from formal than informal sources [71] .",

In extending core cognitive-affective components by incorporating the role of information trust, in particular social information our model more closely approximates an active RID epidemic/pandemic [33] . Differences between the two influenzas might reflect sample difference or indicate that influenza characteristics are themselves an important component driving situation awareness and response and should be factored into models to improve predictive power. Moreover, unlike most cognitive-behavioural models, our model accommodates cognitive and affective elements constituting mental representation of the threat posed by a RID epidemic/pandemic, consistent with the common sense model of illness [72] . Future studies should target theory development to reconcile divergent models and accommodate different findings. Overall, our study provides a stronger foundation from which to develop better behavioural models of responses to future RID epidemics.",
