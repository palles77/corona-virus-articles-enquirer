We have developed a transgenic mouse model to assess lymphocyte-astrocyte interactions. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule, D b, was expressed in astrocytes under the transcriptional control of regulatory sequences from the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene. Baseline cerebral MHC class I mRNA levels from transgenic mice were elevated over those of non-transgenic controls, and a prominent increase in cerebral MHC class I expression occurred following focal, injury-induced astroglial activation within transgenic brains but not in non-transgenic controls. FACS analysis of explant astrocyte cultures from established transgenic lines demonstrated astroglial expression of the GFAP-D b fusion gene at the protein level. Functional antigen-presenting capacity was conferred by the D b transgene, as virus-infected primary astrocytes obtained from transgenic BALB/c mice (KdldDdLa) expressing the D b molecule were lysed by Db-restricted anti-viral CTL.",

Here we report the establishment of transgenic mouse lines in which a constitutive and inducible class I MHC molecule is expressed in CNS astrocytes. Astrocytes provide crucial support for neurons and oligodendrocytes through such diverse functions as the production of neurotrophic factors and the elimination of neurotoxins (reviewed in Eddleston and Mucke, 1993) . Consequently, their impairment or destruction by either antiviral or auto-immune responses would disturb CNS homeostasis. Notably, a variety of DNA and RNA viruses can infect astrocytes in vivo (Epstein et al., 1984; Stowring et al., 1985; Gyorkey et al., 1987; Mirra and del Rio, 1989; Carbone et al., 1991; Itoyama et al., 1991; Rinaman et al., 1993; Epstein et al., 1994) .

Because the exposure to serum-containing media induces astrocytes to express endogenous MHC molecules (Keane et al., 1992) , both transgenic and nontransgenic LCMV-infected astrocytes were effectively lysed by H-2-matched CTL bearing the same H-2 haplotype as the target cell (40% vs. 46% 5]Cr release at E : T ratios of 50 : 1).

Transgenic mice expressing D b MHC molecules on astrocytes displayed similar survival rates as age and sex matched nontransgenic littermates over a 1-year period of observation (data not shown). Further, transgenic mice expressing the MHC molecule in astrocytes showed no signs of CNS impairment and histological analysis of their brains was indistinguishable from that of non-transgenic controls, suggesting that class I MHC expression alone is not sufficient to induce spontaneous neuropathology. The GFAP-D b transgene is expressed in a functional manner as indicated by CTL assay (Table 1) . LCMV-infected astrocytes from GFAP-D b transgenic mice that are normally KdIdD d were specifically lysed by anti-viral, H-2 b restricted CTL while astrocytes from normal BALB/c mice were not. Because the transgene-derived O b molecule is the only H-2 b MHC class I antigen that could be expressed on astrocytes of transgenic BALB/c (H-2 d) mice, lysis of these astrocytes by H-2b-restricted CTL demonstrates that LCMV peptide processing and interaction with the O b minigene product is appropriate for recognition by H-2 b anti-LCMV CTL.",

Experiments using allografts into the rat CNS and under the kidney capsule (Mason et al., 1986) have shown that rats mounted a brisk anti-graft response to the kidney graft while the CNS graft rejection occurred more slowly. This suggests that the microenvironment of the CNS, not the antigen-presenting capacity of the cells themselves, restricts immune recognition. Further, Massa has shown that brain-enriched gangliosides can suppress transcription of class I and II MHC on astrocytes (Massa, 1993) . These results indicate that some cells of the CNS may be under immunosuppressive pressures that inhibit MHC expression resulting in a lack of recognition by the immune surveillance system and avoidance of immune-mediated damage. The ability to express inducible MHC molecules and cytokines in vivo in specific CNS cells by using CNS cell-specific promoters not sensitive to immunosuppressive factors should allow a determination of the immunopathogenic effects of aberrant MHC expression during diverse viral infections and autoimmune diseases of the CNS.",
