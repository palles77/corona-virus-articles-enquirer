There are many emerging and re-emerging diseases which originating from animals and associated with diseases in both human and animals. These diseases cause significant morbidity, mortality and outbreaks in many countries [1] [2] [3] . Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging RNA arbovirus from the Flaviviridae family. It was isolated for the first time from the Rhesus monkey in Zika Forest of Uganda, 1947 [4, 5] . The current ZIKV epidemic began in Brazil in 2015. It is then spreading then to many other parts of the South and North America, several Pacific islands and other countries. In January 2017, The WHO reported that 75 countries around the world notified the continuing of ZIKV mosquito-borne transmission, and 46 of these countries are in the Latin American and Caribbean territories. The virus has recently spread throughout the whole Americas [6, 7] . ZIKV continues to spread geographically to areas where the competent vectors and other suitable environmental factors are existing [7] .",

Transmission can also occur through other thirty-eight Aedes species as Ae. albopictus, Ae. africanus, Ae. luteocephalus, Ae. vitattus, Ae. furcifer, Ae. hensilii and Ae. apicoargenteus. Ae. aegypti mosquito lives and breeds near people and their homes. Aedes laying eggs in stagnant water collections in the puddles, buckets, flower pots, empty cans and other containers [4, 8] . Vertical transmission is another ZIKV mode of infection. During 2016, a proven evidence of causal relationship (causality) was established between microcephaly and other neurological lesions in the infected newborns and the confirmed congenital ZIKV transmission [9] . In 2017, twenty-nine countries or territories have reported microcephaly and other CNS malformations potentially associated with ZIKV infection, or suggestive of congenital infection [6] . Furthermore, it was suspected that ZIKV can be also transmitted after birth through breast feeding [10] . ZIKV infection is suggested to cause abortion and miscarriage. Sexual transmission is a third possible transmission route [11] . A recent systematic review, 2017, reported that ZIKV RNA was detected in semen as late as 188 days (range: 3-188) following onset of symptom, and infectious virus was isolated in semen up to 69 days after onset. No study reported ZIKV isolation from female genital samples, but detection occurred up to 13 days after onset of symptom [12] . The WHO, January 2017, reported that 13 countries have reported evidence of person-to-person transmission of ZIKV [6] .",

Worldwide, 21 countries or territories have reported an increased incidence of GBS and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases in 2017 [6] . ZIKV was suggested to be classified as \"Category V Notifiable Infectious Disease\" resembling other dangerous emerging diseases as Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Therefore, it represents a public health challenge for endemic areas and for the field of travel epidemiology [17] . Combined effort is required for reduction of ZIKV transmission in the infected countries, and for prevention of its transmission into new areas [18] . However, until now there is no licensed ZIKV medical measures (vaccines, preventive drugs or treatment) [18] . It is expected that arrival of ZIKV vaccine may take a minimum of 3-5 years after the initial year of non-human primate testing. However, experts proposed that this duration is an optimistic time for production and license of the vaccine, and it may need up to 20 years [19] .",

Such knowledge is needed as the virus is rapidly manifesting itself in a pandemic alarm [21] . Furthermore, few studies were conducted about knowledge and attitudes of health providers towards ZIKV. Such studies were mainly done in countries where ZIKA is circulating, and based only on few knowledge questions [22, 23] . Knowledge and attitude ZIKV researches allow to obtain insight information to address people's need and continuing overall response to ZIKV epidemic [6] . In addition, medical students in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) need to have adequate information about ZIKV as it can be transmitted to the country due to existence of the same Ae. mosquito, and the existence of anther similar arbovirus which is Dengue Fever (DF). Three DF serotypes; Dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1), DENV-2 and DENV-3, are circulating in the Western region of KSA. There is an increasing incidence of DF over years with confirmation of endemic occurrence of the disease in Jeddah. Furthermore, Aedes Aegypti mosquito is also the main vector of DF transmission (similar to ZIKV) [24] . KSA also hosts one of the largest annual mass gathering worldwide. About 7 million pilgrims are expected to visit Kingdom KSA for Umrah and Hajj yearly, and thousands of them came from Latin American where ZIKV is circulating [25, 26] . Preparedness for Hajj mass gatherings is required in the current era of globalization and international travelling [27] . However, no comprehensive epidemiological studies were conducted to identify knowledge and attitudes of the medical students towards ZIKV. So, such study is needed.",

Similarly, the current study revealed that Facebook and other internet sources were the commonest source of participants' information. These findings indicate the importance of using such tools for spreading the health information and educational messages about ZIKV and other emerging diseases. About one-half of our participants correctly knew that mosquito bite is the commonest mode of ZIKV transmission, while only 4.2% knew its incubation period. Better results were reported from the Indian study [21] . The cause of this discrepancy between both studies may be because the Indian study was done among practitioners (with more knowledge) and not among medical students. However, much better knowledge was obtained from a study performed among attendees of Zika symposium in 4 cities of Colombia from June to July, 2015. After the symposium, all participants identified the correct answer regarding mosquito bite transmission of ZIKV, and almost all of them correctly identified the incubation period [23] . The cause behind such dissimilarities may be because the study of Colombia was done among participants who attended Zika symposium, or may be because the cities of Colombia are endemic in Dengue and Chikungunya fevers which resemble ZIKV, or due to the starting Zika epidemic in the Latin American countries at the time of conduction of their study. Another cross-sectional study done in Pereira and Cartagena cities of Colombia, 2016, showed that most of their respondents (97% and 92.5% in both cities) correctly identified the routes of ZIKV transmission [22] . The cause of their high level of knowledge may be due to extensive spread of ZIKV epidemic during 2016 in the most of the Latin American countries, including Colombia. In such countries, many educational programs were done about ZIKV and this results in increasing their knowledge about it.",

On the other hand, those who attended training programs about ZIKV had significantly better ZIKV knowledge compared to others. A high percentage of the participants identified that ZIKV can spread to Saudi Arabia, while a smaller percentage knew the causes behind this. Regarding the attitudes, most of the participants agreed that there are no adequate measures for preventing ZIKV. Multifaceted approaches are needed to increase awareness of medical students about ZIKV and other emerging diseases. These approaches can be extended to include also the medical practitioners and the community in general. Development of interactive courses on emerging diseases and travel epidemiology is needed for undergraduate medical curricula. Facilitation of medical students' volunteer working in preparedness of important emerging diseases with Ministry of Health and other volunteering bodies is required. Similar studies about ZIKV, and other emerging diseases are recommended to be done among medical practitioners and other target populations. Furthermore, the findings of the current study point out the need for creating international and national programs for addressing the important emerging public health concerns of the nations, especially in the emergence of ZIKV and its complications as microcephaly, GBS and other complications.",
