Enteroviral myocarditis in infancy frequently occurs in conjunction with severe hepatitis, pneumonitis, or both and can be difficult to distinguish from bacterial sepsis. 9 The death rate may be as high as 75%. Severe dysrhythmias have been described in infants with myocardial involvement from RSV, 10 and viral myocarditis has been implicated in some cases of sudden infant death. 11 Older children and adolescents are more likely to appear for examination after a prodromal viral illness. Early symptoms include lethargy, low-grade temperature, and decreased appetite. They may have diaphoresis, dyspnea on exertion, malaise, and palpitations. Chest pain was a frequent symptom in series of adult patients. 12 Resting tachycardia disproportionate to the amount of fever is common, and an apical systolic murmur may be heard. A subset of children and adults have fulminant myocarditis, characterized by rapid onset of symptoms, severe hemodynamic compromise, and fever. 13 Laboratory abnormalities may include elevated white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. 14 Serum aspartate aminotransferase levels are often elevated, 15 as are creatinine kinase-MB levels. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) may be a more sensitive measure of cardiac muscle injury in myocarditis. 16 Electrocardiographic abnormalities are almost always present in acute myocarditis, with findings of low-voltage QRS complexes and nonspecific ST and T wave changes. Both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias may be present, including supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia, as well as conduction abnormalities. Echocardiography reveals left ventricular dysfunction either with segmental wall motion abnormalities or global hypokinesis in most cases. Pericardial effusions are common. In one series, nondilated, thickened, and hypocontractile left ventricles (LVs) were seen in subjects with fulminant myocarditis compared with significant LV dilatation and normal LV thickness in subjects with a more insidious onset. The subjects with fulminant myocarditis had more evidence of inflammation on endomyocardial biopsy and were more likely to recover ventricular function. 17 Pulmonary edema, enlarged cardiac silhouette, and prominent pulmonary vasculature may be seen on a chest radiograph.",

Studies in adults with FHF have found hepatitis A to be the cause in 4% to 10% and hepatitis B in 10% to 45% of the reported cases. 19 A greater percentage of cases of FHF in children may be due to hepatitis A. 20 Many other viruses have been implicated in fulminant hepatitis including hepatitis C, D, E, and G, as well as HSV. Infants with perinatally acquired hepatitis B and C rarely have symptoms, and fulminant hepatitis in infants is more likely to be associated with systemic illness due to enteroviruses, HSV, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), or CMV. 21 Infants born to women with both HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) and anti-HBeAb (hepatitis B e-antibody) appear to be at greater risk for fulminant hepatitis due to perinatally acquired hepatitis B. 22 Infection with hepatitis C rarely causes FHF; however, there are case reports of fulminant hepatitis both with postnatally and perinatally acquired hepatitis C in children. 23, 24 The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection as a cause of FHF appears to have geographic variability. Most studies from the United States and Europe have failed to show the presence of HCV-RNA in patients with non-A, non-B FHF 25 ; however, in several Japanese series, HCV-RNA has been shown in a significant number of patients with non-A, non-B FHF. 26 Coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV has been associated with a worse prognosis. 19 HSV should be considered as a cause of FHF, particularly in patients with minimally elevated bilirubin levels. Risk factors for HSV hepatitis include pregnancy and immune suppression. 27 Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enterically transmitted virus that causes epidemic hepatitis in many areas of the world, particularly the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.

The large DNA virus infects epithelial cells and leukocytes. Cellular damage is caused directly by the viral lytic infection or indirectly by the immune response of the host. Risk factors for CMV disease include seropositivity of donor, allogeneic transplant, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch, age older than 10 years, and development of graft-versus-host disease. CMV occurs at a median time of 40 to 50 days after transplant and is rare before engraftment. The pneumonitis is severe with diffuse interstitial infiltrates. Death rates from CMV pneumonitis are greater than 50%, even when ganciclovir and CMV immunoglobulin are administered. 35 Hantaviruses are known for causing hemorrhagic fevers and acute severe respiratory infection in young adults. Hantaviruses can spread from mammal to mammal, including humans, by exposure to aerosolized feces, infected urine, or other secretions. In the United States, the Sin Nombre virus, which causes the pulmonary syndrome, is found in 10% to 80% of deer mice in rural areas of North America. Hantaviruses cause disease by creating leakage of plasma and erythrocytes through the vascular endothelium in the lung (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS]) or the kidneys (hemorrhagic fever syndrome).

During the neonatal period, type 2, and to a lesser extent type 1 causes encephalitis because of the vertical transmission of the virus. 49 In contrast, in older children and adults, most HSV encephalitis is caused by type 1. HSV 2, however, can cause benign aseptic meningitis in association with primary and recurrent genital infections. 50 Other members of the herpesvirus family (CMV, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], varicella-zoster virus [VZV] , and HHV-6) can also cause aseptic meningitis and encephalitis, though they are less common. CMV encephalitis occurs mostly in immunosuppressed individuals but may occasionally appear in otherwise healthy individuals. 51,52 EBV aseptic meningitis and encephalitis presents with or without the classic findings of infectious mononucleosis. 53 Acute cerebellar ataxia is a common and usually benign complication of chickenpox. VZV encephalitis can sometimes occur in immunocompetent individuals, 54,55 but more frequently occurs in immunocompromised individuals following days, weeks, or months after varicella or zoster. Zoster encephalitis can be complicated by small or large vessel vasculitis (granulomatous arteritis), which carries the potentially serious consequences of infarction. 54,56 HHV-6 has only rarely been reported to cause encephalitis in healthy children during primary infection, 57 whereas it appears to be a more common problem for immunosuppressed patients, such as those receiving stem cell transplants. 58, 126 Arboviruses (arthropod-spread viruses) are important causes of aseptic meningitis and encephalitis. The specific arbovirus determines the epidemiology, morbidity, and risk of death of associated disease. The La Crosse and St. Louis encephalitis viruses account for most arboviral CNS infections in the United States. The La Crosse virus is found 88 \u2022 Life-Threatening Viral Disease and its Treatment mainly in the Midwest, typically occurs in the summer and early fall, and is associated with a relatively low death rate. The St. Louis encephalitis virus occurs in every state but is more common in the Midwest, Florida, and Texas and has been responsible for large urban outbreaks. 59, 60 Eastern equine virus occurs less frequently, mainly in the Northeast and Southeast, but carries a high rate of morbidity (70% to 80%) and death (20% to 80%). 61, 62 West Nile virus encephalitis first appeared in the United States in the summer of 1999 in New York State. 63 Over the following summers, the West Nile virus moved southward and westward across the United States, infecting both animals and humans. Most individuals infected with the West Nile virus are symptom free or experience flulike illness; however, older individuals and those with underlying immune deficiency can experience encephalitis that may result in death. In addition to the more typical presentation of encephalitis, an acute flaccid paralysis has also been associated with West Nile virus infection. 64 A number of viruses are infrequent causes of encephalitis, including mumps, influenza, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses (LCMVs). Historically, mumps virus accounted for a large proportion of aseptic meningitis and encephalitis cases in the United States. 65 Currently, because of the widespread use of the trivalent MMR vaccine, meningitis and encephalitis due to mumps are extremely rare. 66 Influenza has been associated with encephalitis/encephalopathy, especially in Japan. In a national survey representing the 1998-1999 season, 142 cases, most occurring in children younger than 5 years, are reported. 67 LCMV is an infrequently recognized cause of meningoencephalitis. This virus is found in the urine, droppings, and saliva of infected mice, guinea pigs, and hamsters, and disease in humans arises after exposure to these substances.",

In patients with acute hepatitis A, anti-HAV IgM antibodies are detectable in the serum at the onset of symptoms, peak 1 week after onset of symptoms, and become undetectable by 3 to 6 months after infection. The presence of HBsAg in serum indicates active HBV replication and is present in acute and chronic HBV infection. Because of the destruction of actively infected hepatocytes, HBsAg may be absent in FHF, and the only marker of acute HBV infection may be anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBcAb) (anti-HBV core) IgM antibodies. Hepatitis B DNA can also be detected in serum and liver tissue by PCR. Absence of HBsAg or HBV-DNA in the serum does not rule out HBV as the cause of FHF because HBV DNA has been shown in liver tissue of patients with non-A and non-B FHF in whom serologic markers did not suggest HBV infection. 82 Hepatitis D, a hepatotropic virus that causes infection only in the presence of active hepatitis B infection, should be looked for in patients with acute HBV hepatitis because coinfection or superinfection with HDV may result in more severe disease. 83 Hepatitis D coinfection can be determined with anti-HDV antibodies or HDV-RNA in serum. 84 Although the newer generation antibody assays for hepatitis C are more sensitive than past assays, anti-HBcAbs may not be detectable early in disease. Therefore when the epidemiologic findings suggest possible infection with HCV, serum and liver tissue should be analyzed for HCV-RNA by PCR. Detection of HEV-RNA in blood or liver confirms acute infection with HEV. HSV hepatitis is frequently a result of newly acquired infection; thus serologic testing may not be helpful.
