Both, quantum chemistry and GED analyses resulted in C S molecular symmetry with the planar pyridine ring. Obtained molecular parameters confirm the hyperconjugation in the pyridine ring and the sp 2 hybridization concept of the nitrogen and carbon atoms in the ring. The experimental geometric parameters are in a good agreement with the parameters for non-substituted N-oxide and reproduced very closely by DFT calculations. The presence of the electron-donating CH 3 substituent in 4-MePyO leads to a decrease of the ipso-angle and to an increase of r(N/O) in comparison with the non-substituted PyO. Electron density distribution analysis has been performed in terms of natural bond orbitals (NBO) scheme. The nature of the semipolar N/O bond is discussed.",

Among the representatives of this class, there are compounds with bactericidal, analgesic, anticonvulsant activity, as well as ones with apoptotic, antifungal and antimicrobial activity [2, 3] . These properties allow to use N-oxides as inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [4, 5] , as antiviral agent against various SARS coronavirus strains [6] , and as antiadhesive and quorum-sensitive inhibitor [7] . In the literature one can find the evidence, that some complexes with pyridine-N-oxides are used in agriculture to regulate plant growth rates [8] . It was shown that pyridine-N-oxide derivatives are genotoxic [9] . The biochemical activity of N-oxides is usually considered to be the result of complexation with the metalloporphyrins in living organisms [10e12] . The reactivity of Noxides may vary due to different substituents in the ring [13] . The variation of the substituents gives wide possibilities to chemical modifications of N-oxides and allows to influence their complexing properties, and, as the result, their biological activity. To understand the complexation ability of N-oxides with different substituents the detailed information about the properties of free molecules is needed.",

Thus, only pyridine-N-oxide and three of its para-substituted compounds have been studied by gas-electron diffraction (GED) [14, 15] . Analyzing the average values of bond lengths in the pyridine ring the authors of [15] have concluded that the aromaticity increases in the series: 4nitropyridine-N-oxide (4-NO 2 PyO), 4-chloropyridine-N-oxide (4-ClPyO), pyridine-N-oxide (PyO), 4-methylpyridine-N-oxide(4-MePyO). The crystal structures of PyO, 4-NO 2 PyO and 4-MePyO have been studied by X-ray crystallography [16, 17] . The quantum chemical study of the substituent effect on the properties of pyridine-N-oxides has been performed for ten compounds with different substituents [18] . The comparative analysis of structural data obtained by different methods suggests that the molecular parameters of N-oxides obtained by GED [15] look rather strange. Thus, the NeC bond lengths in 4-NO 2 PyO, 4-MePyO, 4-ClPyO recommended in Ref. [15] are even longer than r(CeC) in benzene ring, and seems to be overestimated compare to the calculated values and X-ray data. Moreover, the bond distance r(N/O) in 4-MePyO molecule recommended by authors [15] appears to be significantly overestimated and conflicting with the calculated and X-ray values. Furthermore, the accuracy of GED data obtained in Refs. [14, 15] cannot be considered today as satisfactory.",

Starting parameters from B3LYP/ cc-pVTZ calculations were refined. The differences between all CeC, as well as between all CeH bond lengths were constrained to calculated values (B3LYP/cc-pVTZ). In compliance with the quantum chemical calculation results, a planar skeleton with C 2v symmetry of the pyridine ring was assumed. The methyl group was considered in the framework of C 3v symmetry. Vibrational amplitudes were refined in groups with fixed differences. With the abovementioned assumptions, four bond distances and four bond angles (Table 3) were refined simultaneously with six groups of vibrational amplitudes. Vibrational amplitudes were refined in groups with fixed differences (Table 4 ). Only two correlation coefficients had absolute values larger than 0.7: (r(NeC3))/ (r(C2eC3)) \u00bc \u00c00.74, and (:NC3C2)/(:C3NC4) \u00bc -0.84. The best agreement factor is R f \u00bc 3.4%. Final results of the least squares analysis are given in Table 3 (geometric parameters) and Table 4 (vibrational amplitudes). Table 3 summarizes the structural parameters of 4-Me-PyO. We can note a perfect agreement between calculated and experimental molecular structure parameters. The molecule possesses almost C S symmetry (the torsional angle H5C6C1C2 is close to 90 ) with the planar pyridine ring. Table 5 compares gas-phase structures of PyO and 4-Me-PyO obtained in Refs. [14, 15] and in this work. The parameters obtained in our research is in a good agreement with the theoretical results (therein and [18] ) and, also, with the parameters for non-substituted N-oxide in contrast to the values recommended by Chiang J. F. et al. [15] . Furthermore, the parameters of free molecules of PyO [14] and 4-Me-PyO obtained in this work are in a good agreement with the crystal structures [34, 35] . Apparently, some increase of the semipolar N/O bond lengths in the crystal phase compared to free molecules is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. All parameters presented in Table 5 confirm the hyperconjugation in the pyridine ring and the sp2 hybridization concept of the nitrogen and carbon atoms in the ring. The exceptions are only the data by Chiang J. F. et al. [15] . which look rather strange.",

It is interesting to note, that the substituent effects on the geometry of heterocyclic ring are rather similar to the tendencies for the benzene ring [36, 37] . Thus, the presence of the electron-donating CH 3 substituent leads to the decrease of the ipso-angle.

Table 6 . The CeC and CeN bond orders in the ring for both molecules, as well as the values of the distances from Tables 3 and 5 show that these bonds do not correspond to either single nor double bonds. This confirms the existence of p-conjugation in the pyridine rings. The C1eC6 bond order for 4-MePyO corresponds to the single CeC bond. It is interesting to note that Q(NeO) in both molecules can not be interpreted as exact single or double bond. Moreover, the introduction of an electron-donating substituent increases the bond length N/O, slightly reduces the corresponding bond order and significantly increases the electron density on the oxygen. One can conclude that in this case the nucleophilic properties of the molecule increase. Furthermore, as it has been mentioned previously [18] the introduction of electron-donating substituents to the heterocyclic ring of N-oxides results in increasing ability for complex formation. Our experimental and calculated data (Tables 3, 6 and 7) reveal the incorrectness of the authors of [15] in their conclusion about more single NeO bond character in 4-MePyO.",

Table 7 collects the largest values of calculated second order interaction energies (E 2 ) between donor-acceptor orbitals in PyO and 4-MePyO. In both cases several values correspond to the interactions related to the resonance in the pyridine ring, i.e. the interactions between p(CeC) and p*(CeC) and between p(CeC) and p*(CeN). The nature of semipolar NeO bond was explained in detail [18] . The largest second order interaction energies (E 2 ) in both molecules corre- To study the substituent effect on the aromaticity the nuclear independent chemical shifts NICS(1) have been calculated by using B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ approximation. NICS(1) values correspond to the negative isotropic shielding (in ppm) at 1 \u00c5 above the ring plane. The calculated values of NICS(1): \u00c07.40 (PyO) and \u00c07.36 (4-Me-PyO) are very close to each other. Thus, from the NICS(1) values one can conclude that the introduction of CH 3 group does not noticeably affect the aromaticity of the pyridine-N-oxide. Furthermore, the data of Table 5 do not confirm the conclusion of the authors of [15] about changing the aromaticity with substitution, which was made by analyzing the average values of bond length in the pyridine ring.
