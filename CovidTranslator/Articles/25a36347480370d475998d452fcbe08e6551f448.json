Here, we synthesize the pathways by which projected agricultural expansion and intensification will influence human infectious diseases and how human infectious diseases might likewise affect food production and distribution. Feeding 11 billion people will require substantial increases in crop and animal production that will expand agricultural use of antibiotics, water, pesticides and fertilizer, and contact rates between humans and both wild and domestic animals, all with consequences for the emergence and spread of infectious agents. Indeed, our synthesis of the literature suggests that, since 1940, agricultural drivers were associated with >25% of all -and >50% of zoonotic -infectious diseases that emerged in humans, proportions that will likely increase as agriculture expands and intensifies. We identify agricultural and disease management and policy actions, and additional research, needed to address the public health challenge posed by feeding 11 billion people.",

The social and environmental conditions that give rise to disease emergence are thus of particular interest, as are management approaches that might reduce the risk of emergence or re-emergence 1 . At the same time, undernutrition -the insufficient intake of one or more nutrients -remains a major source of global ill health [2] [3] [4] [5] . Together, the unprecedented rate of infectious disease emergence and the need to sustainably feed the global population represent two of the most formidable ecological and public health challenges of the twentyfirst century [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] (Fig. 1) , and they interact in complex ways (Fig. 2) .",

Credible estimates are available for specific nutrient shortfalls -for example, 1.6 billion people suffering iron-or vitamin B 12 -deficiency anemia 15 , 0.8 billion people with insufficient dietary energy (that is, calorie) intake 16 , 33% of pre-school age children and 15% of pregnant women at risk of vitamin A deficiency 17 -but the world still lacks a rigorous, recent assessment of the population suffering shortfalls of any one or more nutrients, although the number is surely in the billions. By 2100, the United Nations projects that the global population will grow by nearly 4 billion, to exceed 11 billion people 18 . Meeting the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal, to \"eradicate hunger\" (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/) for this expanding human population will necessitate a large increase in food supplies, with major changes to agricultural production and distribution systems, infrastructure and social protection programmes 6 (Fig. 3) . Despite large and, in many cases, growing inequalities, the global population is on average expected to become richer, and historically, with greater affluence has come greater consumption of food products in general and more animal-sourced foods in particular, both of which further increase food demand and thus the requirement for agricultural expansion and/or intensification 19 . Agriculture already occupies about half of the world's land and uses more than two-thirds of the world's fresh water 20 , and recent studies have suggested that agricultural production might need to double or triple by 2100 to keep pace with projected population growth and food demand [6] [7] [8] 21 (Fig. 3) . Meeting this demand using present agricultural production systems could require replacing >10 9 hectares of natural ecosystems with agricultural production, approximately 7% of the global land area, which is larger than the continental United States, although continuous efficiency improvements in agriculture will compel re-evaluation of these estimates. In turn, this agricultural expansion could result in an estimated ~2-fold increase in irrigation, ~2.7-fold increase in fertilizer 6,10,22 and 10-fold increase in pesticide use (Fig. 3) .",

The relationship between infectious disease and nutritional Agricultural production can improve human health by reducing food prices and enhancing nutrition, which can increase resistance to infectious diseases. However, freshwater habitats established for irrigation, as well as other agricultural inputs, often increase the risk of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and schistosomiasis. In general, rural residents are most vulnerable to these increases in infectious disease, whereas consumers some distance away derive most of the benefits from increased food production. To maximize human health given the impending 11 billion humans projected on the planet by 2100, society must minimize the adverse consequences of agricultural growth while maximizing the health benefits.

In addition, poor maternal nutrition and associated impaired fetal growth are strongly associated with neonatal death from sepsis, pneumonia and diarrhoea 4 ; undernourishment is a well-understood risk factor for 4 . Although the traditional Green Revolution approach to food production has succeeded in reducing undernourishment arising from insufficient calorie and protein intake, it has been very slow in reducing micronutrient deficiencies 39 , which can be have significant effects on defence against disease. To make matters worse, where violence, unrest and terrorism impede access to food, such as in parts of Africa and central Asia, morbidity and mortality attributed to communicable diseases can be further exacerbated 2 . Although research suggests that improving nutrition will generally improve responses to infectious diseases, there may be important exceptions. For certain diseases, such as schistosomiasis and many respiratory infections, pathogenesis is a product of host immunity, often from hyperinflammation 40, 41 . Thus, undernutrition can actually decrease symptoms by reducing the strength and pathogenicity of immune responses 40 . In addition, as nutrition improves, some parasites might proliferate faster than immunity can increase 34 , resulting in more, rather than less, morbidity, with the classic example that dietary intake of iron can increase malariainduced mortality 42 .",

One major change in rural infrastructure that often accompanies agricultural development is the redistribution of fresh water, which has well-known consequences for the transmission of infectious diseases. For example, because 40% of crop production comes from only the 16% of agricultural land that is irrigated, and irrigated lands accounted for much of the increased yields experienced during the Green Revolution 10 , the potential for increased irrigation infrastructure to exacerbate infectious diseases is a critical concern (Fig. 1) . Importantly, agricultural development has caused both declines of certain types of fresh water, such as wetlands, and increases of others, such as dams, reservoirs and irrigation schemes.",

Similarly, some of the earliest successes in malaria control at the turn of the twentieth century occurred in the southern United States, where wetland drainageincluding for agricultural conversion -was one of a suite of antitransmission strategies used by the Rockefeller Foundation in its landmark malaria control efforts 55 .",

For example, construction of the Aswan High Dam in Egypt and the accompanying irrigation network was associated with a rise in mosquito vectors and the disfiguring mosquito-borne disease lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as human elephantiasis 57 . Likewise, dam and irrigation construction resulted in increases in malaria in Sri Lanka and India 56, 58 , and a sevenfold increase in malaria in Ethiopia 59 . A meta-analysis of 58 studies revealed that humans living near irrigation schemes or in close proximity to large dam reservoirs had significantly higher risk of schistosome infections than humans that did not live near these water resources 60 , at least partly because of increased freshwater habitat for intermediate snail hosts. Similarly, a recent analysis of schistosomiasis case data from the past 70 years across sub-Saharan Africa showed far-reaching effects of dams and irrigation schemes, with increases in schistosomiasis risk extending up to hundreds of kilometres upstream from the dams themselves 61 . Hence, dams, reservoirs and irrigation networks related to agricultural expansion are likely to increase vector-borne and waterborne diseases unless water resources are developed in deliberate and coordinated ways to mitigate these risks 62 .",

The world's population became majority urban in 2007 and urbanization continues to outpace population growth, especially in developing countries. Urbanization necessarily extends food supply chains, as consumers reside further from farms and fisheries. Although only 23% of the food produced globally for human consumption is traded across international borders 63 , globalization is likewise elongating food supply chains. Furthermore, as the costs of international travel have declined over time, the movement of people across borders has likewise increased. The expanded spatial scope and increased frequency, speed and volume of people and agricultural products moving within and among countries necessarily facilitates the spread of pathogens. For example, in Ecuador, there is evidence that the construction of new roads has affected the epidemiology of diarrheal diseases by changing contact rates among people as well as between people and contaminated water sources 64 . Each year in the United States, there are already an estimated 48 million people with illnesses, 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths from food-borne infections 65 , and imported foods -especially from developing countries with poor sanitation infrastructure and weak food safety enforcement -have been associated with a rise in food-borne illness 66 . In addition, globalization is already thought to be a factor in the spread of human influenza viruses that spillover from poultry and swine 67, 68 . Although modernization of food supply chains, especially those linking farms in developing countries to high-income consumers in cities and high-income countries, has typically accelerated the diffusion of stricter food safety and quality standards 69, 70 , as urbanization and globalization further extend food supply chains, enhanced monitoring for the spread of pathogens across transportation networks and strengthened food safety regulations will be needed.",

As the global human population increases, there will almost certainly be an increase in high density, industrialized livestock and aquaculture operations. Currently, such livestock operations are vulnerable to devastating losses of animals to disease. For instance, in just the last 25 years, an influenza A virus (H5N1) and a foot-and-mouth outbreak led to the destruction of more than 1.2 million chickens 10 and 6 million livestock in China and Great Britain 71 , respectively, and a 'mad cow disease' epizootic led to the slaughter of 11 million cattle worldwide 10 . Similar scenarios have occurred in aquaculture. In the past three decades, there has been more than fourfold growth in industrial aquaculture worldwide 72 , which should continue to increase as food demand grows and wild fish and shellfish captures push the limits of renewable production 73 . Bacterial outbreaks in aquaculture are common, especially in developing countries where there are sanitary shortcomings 72 . In an effort to prevent these catastrophic disease-associated losses and improve animal growth, the agricultural industry uses a larger proportion of global antibiotic and anthelmintic production than human medicine, and most of the antibiotics are provided at non-therapeutic doses in the absence of any known disease 74, 75 . In fact, although estimates are lacking for most countries in the world, in the United States, nearly nine times more antibiotics are given to animals than humans and, of the antibiotics given to animals, more than 12 times as many are used nontherapeutically as therapeutically 74 .",

For example, livestock are a primary source of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli strains that are pathogenic to humans 74 . There is evidence that antibiotic-resistance genes acquired from aquaculture are being transferred to human systems and these pathogens have subsequently caused outbreaks 72 . Anthelmintic resistance is also rife among parasitic worms of livestock and is strongly implied for parasitic worms of humans 77 . As livestock and aquaculture production expand to address growing food demands, it is likely that current antibiotics and anthelmintics will become less effective because of evolved resistance, and thus infectious diseases of domesticated animals and humans will be more difficult to treat 75 .",

            "text": "A major concern is the potential for positive feedbacks between poverty, biodiversity loss, soil degradation and infectious disease 106, 107 . Several mechanisms can underpin these reinforcing relationships. The first arises as a result of poor rural peoples' reliance on limited biophysical assets for their livelihoods. As households clear forests, deplete soils or overharvest biota to meet near-term consumption needs, this resource degradation can compromise future economic productivity and increase disease risk. In addition, poverty, environmental degradation, biodiversity loss and disease can quickly become mutually reinforcing responses to natural shocks, such as droughts or floods, or to protracted conflict in a region. There are also more direct examples. For instance, global net losses of tropical forests remained unchanged during the 1990s and 2000s (at approximately 6 million ha yr \u22121 or 0.38% annually 108 ; also see https://glad.umd.edu/projects/global-forest-watch and https:// www.globalforestwatch.org) and forest clearing can lead to transmission of zoonotic disease by increasing contact with wild animals. Conversely, encroachment of people and domesticated animals into natural areas can introduce diseases to wildlife that can devastate wild populations and create reservoirs for the disease to be transmitted back to domesticated animals 109 (see next section for further discussion and citations). Especially as the agricultural frontier expands, considerable attention must be paid to monitoring and managing these biodiversity-poverty-disease feedbacks 106 .",

When virulence of a pathogen is tied to its propagule generation within the body (such as occurs with many viral infections), the intermediate virulence hypothesis posits that an intermediate level of virulence maximizes parasite transmission because it balances producing many parasite offspring (increasing parasite fitness) with detriments to host survival due to pathology (decreasing parasite fitness). The balance in this trade-off determines parasite persistence. Hence, as host densities increase and transmission becomes more frequent, the cost of increased virulence declines, shifting the optimum towards higher virulence 111 . Consequently, for pathogens that experience this virulence trade-off, increases in human, crop and livestock densities have the potential to augment both the incidence and severity of infectious diseases.",

Similarly, when free-range turkeys were prevented from interacting with wild birds and when interactions between domesticated pigs and wild fruit bats were reduced, influenza and Nipah virus incidence 115 , human pathogens that are currently or originally zoonotic 29, 116 , and recent emerging pathogens that are zoonotic 1, 29 . dropped, respectively, suggesting wild-animal sources of these infections 120, 121 .

The consequences of these pressures might initially increase contact rates between humans and wildlife. This could increase disease risk as bushmeat hunting is already thought to be responsible for several emerging human infectious diseases 116 . To make matters worse, bushmeat hunting is the second biggest threat to biodiversity behind habitat loss, and biodiversity losses can contribute to disease emergence 101 . However, if humans overexploit these natural resources, then human-wildlife interactions could eventually decline as species go extinct, which could reduce spillover events. Changes in the composition of biodiversity associated with overhunting and overfishing can also have complex indirect effects on disease risk mediated by species interactions. For example, empirical evidence supports the notion that defaunation of large vertebrates in Africa should increase zoonotic disease risk by reducing the predators and competitors (large herbivores) of rodents, a common reservoir of human pathogens 124 . Similarly, overfishing of snail-eating cichlids in Lake Malawi in Africa seems to have been a causal factor in snail population and human schistosomiasis increases there 125 . Investigations of the effects of overexploitation on infectious diseases remain in their infancy, but the consequences for human populations could be profound.",

For example, the overuse of antibiotics, anthelmintics and pesticides to prevent diseases is driving resistance to these chemicals that will compromise future crop, livestock and aquaculture production. In sub-Saharan Africa, areas with higher historical tsetse-fly abundance, the vector of the parasite (Trypanosoma brucei) that causes African sleeping sickness in humans and cattle, experienced greater lags in the adoption of animal husbandry practices (for fertilizer and labour in agricultural enterprise) that hindered agricultural development and prosperity in Africa long before and after Europeans colonized 126 . In rural subsistence communities, any source of ill health can significantly impact people's productivity, yields and agricultural output [47] [48] [49] . For example, human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS has reduced average life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa by 5 years since 1997, and a Kenyan study found that crop production by rural subsistence-farming families dropped 57% after the death of a male head of household 127 . Many neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) impose devastating productivity losses for affected people that can impede agricultural development from local to national to regional scales 49 .

One urgent challenge is the problem of antibiotic, anthelmintic and pesticide resistance. Analyses demonstrate that, in some cases, improvements in growth and feed consumption can be achieved by improved hygiene instead of antibiotics 76 . Indeed, all antibiotics as growth promoters were banned in the European Union in 2006 129 . To curb antimicrobial consumption in food animal production, Van Boeckel et al. 75 suggest: (1) enforcing global regulations to cap antimicrobial use, (2) adhering to nutritional guidelines leading to reduced meat consumption, and (3) imposing a global user fee on veterinary antimicrobial use. In addition, as recommended by the World Health Organization, International Organization for Epizootics, and Food and Agriculture Organization, national and international policies based on best management practices should be developed and implemented that document when and how antibiotics should be used, and agencies should be established to monitor their use, mandate reporting and enforce these policies 76 . Finally, given that host genetic variability can reduce disease risk 110 , large-scale industrial livestock operations could add genetic variability into their artificially selected food animals in an effort to reduce epidemics and epizootics. These changes promise to secure the long-term viability of antibiotics and anthelmintics for curing diseases of humans and non-human animals.",

Limiting NTDs could also have knock-on effects for education and health literacy because NTDs impede cognition, learning and school attendance 49 . Indeed, an investment of just US$3.50 per child for NTD control can result in the equivalent of an extra school year of education 49 . This is likely an underestimate because of unaccounted for indirect effects of deworming on learning. A recent study revealed large cognitive gains among children who were not dewormed but had older siblings who were 130 .

By reducing food demand, these drugs could also protect the environment by reducing the conversion rate of natural areas to agriculture. This, in turn, might help to curb climate change, which is one of the greatest threats to global food security 11 and might also increase disease risk 131, 132 .

Historically, humans have combated emerging diseases through early detection followed by coordinated quarantine, as demonstrated by the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the Ebola outbreak in 2014. We recommend continued and improved coordinated international disease surveillance, but this approach reacts to rather than prevents disease. We recommend a shift in both research and disease management efforts towards proactive management approaches. One proactive approach that has promise for preventing zoonotic disease emergence is biodiversity conservation 98, 101 , but more research is needed to evaluate its effectiveness across various types of zoonotic diseases and its costs and benefits relative to more proven reactive public health interventions. Ultimately, science needs a better understanding of pathogen spillover, the origins of disease emergence and post-spillover evolution so that human disease emergence can be better predicted and prevented 112, 113, 133 .",

Crops and livestock genetically adapted to resist more pests can reduce pesticide and antibiotic use.

The complexity further increases from the tensions that arise in balancing expanding agricultural systems, social benefits and infectious disease risk. All of this complexity can overwhelm many analytical tools and experiments, which makes advances in mathematical modelling especially crucial to addressing these issues. Box 1 describes several examples of advances in mathematical modelling that illustrate their promise for analysing the links between agricultural practices and the dynamics of infectious diseases, projecting risks to future decades, influencing risks through either intentional (policies and interventions) or unintentional (continued habitat Box 1 | Modelling tools for quantitative analysis of agriculture-infectious disease systems Mathematical models facilitate the investigation of a complex web of interactions between agricultural systems, social dynamics and infectious diseases in the presence of the substantial nonlinearities inherent in these disparate processes. A notable example is a body of theory and analyses that have emerged to examine the links between agricultural systems and the dynamics of infectious diseases in the context of global development 48 . The approach combines ecological and economic theory to model population subsistence and health, with the goal of examining the conditions under which subsistence and health needs of populations are met. The fundamental consumer-resource relationships that underlie the biological generation of capital via agricultural production can be formalized in ordinary differential equation models, which can be coupled with similarly structured models that estimate the gains and losses in human capital associated with population health and the increasing risk of acquiring and succumbing to infectious diseases associated with poverty.",

High prevalence of infectious diseases among populations that rely heavily on subsistence, labour-intensive agriculture can reduce agricultural productivity, degrade human capital, undermine economic growth and generate conditions that systematically reinforce poverty 48 . Poverty, in turn, increases disease transmission as the lack of access to clean water and preventive care often associated with the lifestyle of the poor make them continuously exposed to parasites and pathogens embedded in the environment 142 . Malnutrition, a common consequence of poverty, may weaken immune response and increase susceptibility to disease. Poor education and lack of resources lead to further reduction of health-seeking behaviour. Modelling shows that the reinforcing feedback between poor health, labour productivity and capital formation triggers a cycle of increasing poverty and disease, known as disease-driven 'poverty trap' 48 . It also shows that poverty traps are reinforced by the asymmetry between the slow pace of investment in disease protection associated with increasing capital due to agricultural development, and the relatively faster ecological changes in transformed landscape that foster disease transmission 143 .",

These new empirical field data are what are desperately needed to explore whether the predictions of highly stylized models are supported in settings far more complex than modelled.

Although this sort of integrative thinking has been historically rare because agriculture and public health have been perceived as disparate disciplines, it is beginning to slowly penetrate these distinct fields of study. For example, several agrochemicals seem to increase the risk of human schistosomiasis and agriculturally derived zoonotic pathogens, and thus researchers are actively attempting to identify agrochemicals that might 'kill two birds with one stone' , reducing crop pests and thus increasing food production while not increasing or even decreasing human pathogens [137] [138] [139] . Similarly, researchers are beginning to consider the introduction of prawns as biological control agents of schistosomiasis, which could simultaneously decrease disease and increase nutrition -because restored prawns can be fished, harvested and consumed without compromising their diseasecontrolling benefits 61, 140 . We believe that more resourceful and creative thinking and interdisciplinary interactions (among medicine, public health, agriculture professionals, economists, anthropologists, sociologists, modellers, empiricists and wildlife biologists, in the developed and developing world) have great promise for sustainably and simultaneously improving human nutrition while controlling infectious diseases.",
