A mixture of lipid and dextrose provides the ferret's resting energy requirement (Rebecca Remillard, PhD, DVM, ACVN, Angell Memorial Animal Hospital, Boston, MA, personal communication, November 1997). This mixture is supplemented with amino acids, electrolytes, water-soluble vitamins, and minerals, and fluid is added so the total solution meets daily fluid volume requirements. Such all-in-one solutions can be refrigerated for at least 7 days. A silicone elastomer or polyurethane jugular catheter (Cook Veterinary Products, Bloomington, IL) is recommended for delivery of the solution by infusion pump. Hospitalized ferrets eating voluntarily and without special dietary requirements are optimally provided with their regular diet. Otherwise, offer a premium-quality dry cat, kitten, or ferret food . Ferrets have high fat and animal protein requirements and metabolize fat more efficiently for energy than carbohydrates. 7 If a ferret requires fasting before surgery for the evaluation of blood glucose or for radiographic examination of the gastrointestinal tract, do not withhold food for more than 6 hours. 6 Ferrets with insulinoma are especially at risk for developing profound hypoglycemia during extended periods of fasting.",

Most cases of urethral obstruction involve male ferrets and are the result of cystic calculi or hyperplastic prostatic-like tissue at the neck of the bladder? Catheterization of the male is complicated by the Jshaped os penis as well as the very small diameter of the penile urethra. Place the male in dorsal recumbency, and aseptically prepare the prepuce. If the prepuce or tip of the penis is swollen, a small incision can be made in the preputial opening to exteriorize the penis. 7 The tissue covering the os penis is very thin. A surgicalloupe aids visualization of the small penile urethral opening lying on the ventral surface of the penis several millimeters proximal to the tip of the os. A 24-gauge pediatric catheter with the stylet removed can be used to localize the urethral orifice (Fig. 2) . Flush the catheter with sterile saline if resistance is met while catheterizing the urethra. In some cases, a 3.5-Fr rubber feeding tube can be used as an indwelling catheter, but this will be too large in many ferrets. The author most often uses a 20-or 22-gauge, 8-in. jugular catheter with the stylet removed (see the section on IV catheterization). The stylet can be left in place with the end retracted to provide support around the pelvic flexure, but exercise extreme caution to avoid perforation of the urethra. Suture the catheter to the skin using tape butterflies, and tape the administration port of the catheter to a tongue depressor to prevent kinking. Place a padded bandage taped to the skin, and attach the catheter to a closed urinary collection system. Monitor the ferret carefully, because many animals attempt to remove the bandage and catheter. The ferret with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated empirically with a broad spectrum antibiotic (see the section on cystitis). For catheterization of the female ferret, place the anesthetized patient in ventral recumbency, elevate the hindquarters, and aseptically prepare the vulva and perivulvar area. Use a small vaginal speculum or otoscope cone to locate the urethral opening on the ventral floor of the vaginal vestivule, approximately 1 to 1.5 cm cranial to the clitoral fossa?' 42 Use a catheter as described above for the male ferret.",

Ferrets with CDV may initially present with clinical signs similar to influenza but go on to develop a severe crusting dermatitis on the face and other areas of the body as well as marked hyperkeratosis of the footpads. 52 Ferrets that have advanced CDV infection may also present with neurologic signs. 53 Bacterial pneumonia is occasionally seen in ferrets. Pulmonary mycosis is uncommonly reported. 9 , 50 Radiographs and a CBC are often the most helpful initial diagnostic tests in cases of pneumonia. 9 A neutrophilic leukocytosis with a left shift may be pronounced. 9 ,5o Radiographs demonstrate an interstitial pattern progressing to an alveolar pattern if the pneumonia worsens. 50 Aspiration pneumonia primarily involves the dependent lung lobes. If the ferret is stable, a tracheal wash to collect samples for cytology as well as bacterial and fungal cultures is important in guiding treatment. Diagnosis of CDV is generally made on the basis of clinical signs, but viral inclusion bodies may be visualized or fluorescent antibody tests performed on conjunctival or mucus membrane scrapings. 52 Treatment for influenza consists of supportive care. Antihistamines used to control sneezing or to improve appetite include chlorpheniramine (1 to 2 mg / kg PO q8 to 12h) or diphenhydramine (0.5 to 2.0 mg/ kg PO q8 to 12h).9, 13 Use antibiotics only if a secondary bacterial infection is suspected. Euthanasia is recommended for ferrets with CDy'9,62 Antibiotic treatment of bacterial pneumonia is based on culture and sensitivity results. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics to consider while awaiting culture results include trimethoprim / sulfonamide (30 mg/kg of combined drug PO qI2h), cephalexin (15 mg / kg PO qI2h), or amoxicillin / clavulanate (22 mg/kg PO q8h).9, 13, 50 Parenteral antibiotics used with cats more rapidly achieve therapeutic blood levels in severe cases. Nebulization with gentocin may be useful in young animals. 9",

In the author's experience, the most common differential diagnoses for urinary obstruction include prostatic enlargement associated with adrenocortical disease in males, urolithiasis, and cystitis. Less frequently, bladder neoplasia has also been reported as a cause of dysuria. 19 Initial treatment for urinary obstruction is urethral catheterization. Place an indwelling catheter while determining the origin of the obstruction. If a urinary catheter cannot be passed, a 25-or 28-gauge needle can be used to perform cystocentesis as an emergency measure. Submit urine collected for urinalysis and culture and sensitivity. A cystostomy allows catheterization of the bladder directly from the body wall if passage of a catheter via the urethra is obstructed. Submit blood for a CBC and serum chemistry. Place an IV catheter and begin fluid diuresis concentrating on correction of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is recommended once a urine culture has been submitted and a urinary catheter placed (refer to the section on cystitis). Further diagnostics to determine the cause of the obstruction include radiographs and abdominal ultrasound. Along with ultrasonographic evaluation of the bladder, areas of special interest include the urethra, periurethral region, and adrenal glands.",

Additional differential diagnoses for hypoglycemia include anorexia or starvation, sepsis, neoplasia, hepatopathy, and other metabolic disease. 1 Insulinoma affects ferrets ranging in age from 2 to 7 yearsY Initial signs may be insidious and attributed by the owner to geriatric changes in their ferret. 49 The history may include episodes of collapse with hypersalivation or extreme weakness lasting from minutes to hours that typically resolve after administration of sugar-containing solutions. 43 Other common clinical signs include depression, rear limb weakness (which may be apparent as posterior paresis or ataxia), gagging, pawing at the mouth, or a dazed appearance. Occasionally severely hypoglycemic ferrets appear dyspneic. Signs are often intermittent and may not be apparent on clinical presentation. Although hypoglycemic seizures are the most common clinical sign of insulinoma in the dog, they are rare in ferretsY When a ferret over the age of 2 years presents collapsed or exhibiting any of the clinical signs described, immediately evaluate the BG level. Initial evaluation can be performed with glucose measurement strips or a digital glucometer. 43 For more accurate evaluation of BG levels, submit blood in a sodium fluoride (gray top) tube. A BG glucose level less than 70 mg/ dL with accompanying clinical signs is suspicious for insulinoma, and ferrets presenting collapsed or comatose often have BG levels lower than 40 mg/dL.9, 43 An elevated serum insulin concentration (using an assay that has been validated for ferrets) concurrent with hypoglycemia is diagnostic for insulinoma, In cases of hypoglycemic collapse, administer a slow IV bolus of 50% dextrose (0.5 to 2 mL) to response, 43 The goal of treatment is stabilization and not the complete reversal of hypoglycemia. If dextrose is administered too rapidly, the tumor will be stimulated to release large amounts of insulin, resulting in rebound hypoglycemia, Place an IV catheter and begin infusion of fluids supplemented with 5% dextrose, Control rare persistent seizures with diazepam (refer to the section on seizures). Administer prednisone (0.5 to 2 mg/kg SQ) to inhibit peripheral tissue uptake of glucose and stimulate gluconeogenesis. 43 Begin with the lowest dose needed to maintain adequate BG levels (i,e\" > 70 mg/ dL), Continue to monitor clinical signs along with BG concentrations q12h, and increase dextrose supplementation if necessary. Once the ferret is stable, administer prednisone orally. In cases of persistent hypoglycemia, concurrently administer diazoxide, which acts to inhibit insulin release from pancreatic beta cells, beginning at the low end of the dose range (5 to 30 mg/kg PO q12h).43 Once clinical signs have resolved, gradually discontinue dextrose supplementation while monitoring the BG level, and adjust medications accordingly, Prednisone doses can often be lowered with concurrent administration of diazoxide. Offer a meatbased, high-protein ferret or feline diet while avoiding foods high in sugar or carbohydrate.",
