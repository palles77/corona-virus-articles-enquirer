This rewiring involves a highly regulated cascade of viral gene 49 expression over various kinetic classes [5] . The first viral gene to be expressed after infection is 50 E1A, a multi-functional transcription factor that activates downstream viral transcription, liberates 51 E2F from RB proteins, as well as alters host transcriptional responses to the virus [11] [12] [13] [14] . While 52 all E1A molecules have identical 5' and 3' nucleotide sequences, splicing of differently sized 53 internal introns allows for the production of discrete proteins that lack specific functional domains 54 conserved across serotypes [15] . Early after infection, E1A is expressed mainly as large and small 55 isoforms, but later in infection alternative splicing leads to the production of a 9 Svedberg E1A 56 isoform (E1A-9s) as well as low abundance doubly-spliced E1A-11s and E1A-10s. The second 57 viral gene to be activated is E1B, consisting of predominantly two spliced isoforms producing 19-58 kilodalton and 55-kilodalton proteins, with two less abundant isoforms generating putative ORFs 59 of 156 and 93 residues [16] . While E1B-19K acts to block cellular apoptosis [17] , E1B-55K is 60 polyadenylation sites leading to E3A and E3B transcription units, and these gene products are 69 primarily involved in modulating the host innate immune system [28] [29] [30] . Like E1A, the E4 region 70 on the reverse strand has identical 5' and 3' regions, and encodes up to six ORFs by removal of 71 a first intron of varying length. E4 region transcripts encode for multifunctional proteins that are 72 involved in regulation of transcription, splicing, and translation of viral RNAs, as well as 73",

Using high 251 quality and high depth short-read sequencing, we were able to detect SNPs within the transcribed 252 regions of the genome approaching 100% penetrance, indicating that these sites were likely 253 present in the genome and not due to RNA editing or modifications. We recapitulated the known 254 TSS and CPAS sites throughout the Ad5 genome, and annotated novel splicing events within the 255 viral transcriptome.

            "text": "131 transcriptional units. Using this integrated approach, we have discovered 20 additional viral 132 polyadenylated RNAs for a total of 75 unique mRNAs produced by Ad5. Of these novel isoforms, 133 seven RNAs encode for a canonical ORF with changes in upstream or downstream splicing. The 134 remaining 13 encode new ORFs or alter existing ORFs by internal truncations or in-frame fusion 135 RNA-seq reveals high-confidence SNPs within the Ad5 genome 141 Illumina-based RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) relies on the fractionation of RNA molecules 142 before reverse transcription into complementary DNA, and therefore loses information such as 143 RNA modifications and the context of splice junctions within full length molecules. However, the 144 accuracy of each individual base call is very high [60]. Using bcftools, a common variant-calling 145 algorithm designed to assess allele-specific variation within RNA-seq, we were able to detect 146 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the RNA transcriptome that likely emerge from 147 mutation within the DNA genome [61,62]. While RNA modifications such as inosine can be read 148 as SNPs during the process of reverse transcription, these events should not approach the near 149 100% read depth stringency we required among our three biological replicates to call a conserved 150 variant [63]. While this technique is only applicable for the actively transcribed region of the 151 genome, nearly every nucleotide of the gene-dense AdV genome is transcribed at a sufficient 152 level for this strategy to provide meaningful data. 153 In total, we discovered 24 SNPs and no insertions or deletions in the Ad5 genome when 154 compared to the original annotation (Figure 1). Of these mutations, exactly half (12) are not 155 predicted to change amino acid coding capacity, with two SNPs occurring within untranslated 156 regions of viral RNA and the remaining ten leading to synonymous amino acid codons within all 157 reading frames annotated to be protein producing. The remaining 12 mutations are predicted to 158 lead to coding sequence variations at the amino acid level, with all examples being missense 159 mutations and no evidence of premature stop codons. Importantly, none of the mutations 160 discovered generated novel RNA splice sites. These data demonstrate the ability to call mutations 161 within the DNA genomes of viruses using solely high-depth RNA sequencing data. Furthermore, 162 detecting only 24 SNPs out of 35,938 nucleotides highlights the overall genomic stability of AdV. 163 164 Combined short-read and long-read sequencing showcases adenovirus transcriptome 165",

Resulting sequence reads were aligned to the Ad5 172 reference genome using either GSNAP for short-reads [65], or MiniMap2 for long-reads [66]. 173 Overall sequencing depth for both forward and reverse reads are shown in Figure 2. While 174 Illumina sequencing provided on average three times the read depth when compared to dRNA 175 sequencing, the overall coverage plots were similar. 176 dRNA-seq is performed in the 3' -> 5' direction and thus allows precise mapping of the 3' 177 ends of transcripts at which poly(A) tails are added (cleavage and polyadenylation site, CPAS) 178 [64]. Where the quality of input RNA is high, a variable proportion of sequence reads extend all 179 the way to their transcription start site (TSS). By collapsing sequences reads to their 5' and 3' 180 ends, we were able to implement a peak-calling approach to predict TSS and CPAS [57], and 181 map their positions along both the forward and reverse strand of the viral genome (Figure 2). In 182 addition, ContextMap2 [67] was used to mine Illumina RNA-seq data for short read sequences 183 containing poly(A) stretches that could be aligned against the viral genome for an orthogonal 184 method of CPAS detection (Figure 2). Mapping the TSS on the forward strand revealed the 185 locations of the E1A, E1B, pIX, MLP, and E3 promoters, while the reverse strand revealed the 186 E4, UXP, E2-early, E2-late, and IVa2 promoters. We did not detect any transcripts starting internal 187 to L4 at the proposed L4 promoter [45]. When mapping CPAS loci, we saw great concordance 188 between the dRNA-seq and ContextMap2 performed on short-read sequences. On the forward 189 strand we were able to detect previously mapped CPAS events at the E1A, E1B/pIX, E3A, E3B, 190 and individual L1 through L5 sites. On the reverse strand we detected CPAS at the E4, UXP/DBP, 191 and E2B/IVa2 locations. In addition, we also detected TSS and CPAS around the RNA pol III-192 derived VA RNA I (Figure 2). While pol III transcripts are generally not polyadenylated, and thus 193 would not be captured by our nanopore sequencing approach, it was previously reported that low 194 levels of polyadenylation can occur on these transcripts [68]. Given the high abundance of AdV 195 VA RNAs (up to 10 8 copies per cell during late infection), it remains likely that low level VA RNA 196 polyadenylation events are occurring [35]. 197To generate accurate splicing maps of AdV transcripts we combined the sensitivity of 198 short-read sequencing to identify RNA junctions and then placed them in the context of full-length 199",

            "text": "such as Fiber driven by the E3 promoter, E3-10K driven by the Major Late Promoter, and DBP 209 driven by the E4 promoter. Within transcriptional units, we discovered the presence of internal 210 splice sites leading to in-frame truncations of existing ORFs, such as L4-22K and four distinct 211 isoforms of truncated L4-100K. We also discovered splicing events predicted to lead to in-frame 212 fusion events within transcriptional units, such as fusions between N-terminal fragments of L4-213 100K and L4-33K or L4-pVIII or the X-Z-Fiber ORF. Furthermore, gene fusion events were 214 observed that join disparate transcriptional units, such as an N-terminal fragment of E1B-19K and 215 pIX (19K/IX) or E4orf6 and DBP (E4orf6/DBP). Lastly, we detected a splice site leading to a novel 216 ORF of predicted 13 kilodaltons (L2-Unk13K) between the splice sites for L2-V and L2-pX. This 217 novel L2 splice site was conserved in Ad2 [53]. Overall, we discovered 20 new isoforms for a total 218 of 75 expressed RNA isoforms during Ad5 infection. Of these, many potentially exciting fusions 219 and truncations of existing ORFs remain to be explored. 220 221 Direct RNA Sequencing unambiguously distinguishes early and late transcription 222We next determined if we could provide unambiguous detection of viral transcripts over a 223 time-course of infection that recapitulated early and late viral kinetics. By aligning long reads to 224 the fully re-annotated viral transcriptome (as opposed to the viral genome), and only counting the 225 reads that could be unambiguously assigned to a single transcript, we were able to detect all of 226 the canonical and newly discovered transcripts(Figure 3). At 12 hours post infection (hpi) the 227 majority of viral transcripts detected were early RNAs, particularly E1A-large and E1A-small, E1B-228 19K and E1B-55K, early promoter DBP, and E4orf3 (Figure 3A). However, at this time point we 229 still detected low-level viral late transcripts that progressed beyond the L1 polyadenylation site,230 corroborating recent work [54]. At 24 hpi, however, viral gene expression shifted to be dominated 231 by late gene expression, as well as early transcripts derived from the E1B locus (Figure 3B). At 232 late times post infection we also saw the E3-Fiber transcript, 19K/IX, and E4-DBP transcripts 233 increase dramatically, potentially implicating these messages as novel late transcripts, with 234 expression as abundant as the recently described late UXP transcript [47,48]. Furthermore, while 235 all permutations of the X, Y, and Z leaders preceding Fiber were previously detected by short-236 read sequencing these could not be phased to full-length transcript isoforms [53,70]. Our full-237 length RNA data indicate that all Fiber transcripts can be detected, but MLP-Fiber and Y-Fiber 238 are the most abundant, followed by XY-Fiber, and then all other isoforms. While the previous lack 239 of detection of some of these novel transcripts can be explained by low overall abundance (e.g., 240 L2-Unk13K, L4-100K/VIII) many of the L4-100K truncations and L4-33K fusions are expressed at 241 levels higher than that of the bona fide late transcript UXP. These data demonstrate that the newly 242 discovered viral transcripts can be reproducibly detected over a time-course of infection with Ad5, 243 as well as display differential expression based on the stage of infection. 244 245 Discussion 246 DNA viruses encode large amounts of information in compact genomes through 247 alternative splicing, overlapping transcripts, and transcription from both strands of the genome.",

To identify variants such 337 as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (InDels), we combined 338 mpileup and call from the bcftools (v1.9) package [61,62]. Here we used the following flags \"--339 redo-BAQ --min-BQ 30 --per-sample-mF\" and \"--multiallelic-caller --variants-only\" respectively. 340Finally, we only considered variants if they were called significantly in all 3 replicates.

Isolated poly(A) RNA was 346 subsequently spiked with 0.3 \u00b5l of a synthetic Enolase 2 (ENO2) calibration RNA (Oxford 347 Nanopore Technologies Ltd.) and prepared for sequencing using standard protocol steps 348 previously described [57,64]. Sequencing was carried out on a MinION MkIb with R9.4.1 (rev D) 349 flow cells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd.) for 20 hours and generated 550,000-770,000 350 sequence reads per dataset. Raw fast5 datasets were basecalled using Guppy v3.2.2 (-f FLO-351 MIN106 -k SQK-RNA002) and subsequently aligned against the adenovirus Ad5 reference 352 genome (AC_000008.1) using MiniMap225 (-ax splice -k14 -uf --secondary=no), a splice aware 353 aligner [66]. Resulting SAM files were parsed using SAMtools v1.3 [83]. sites (TSS) as well as RNA cleavage and polyadenylation sites were 357 identified as follows. Sorted BAM files containing sequence reads aligned to the Ad5 genome 358 were parsed to BED12 files using BEDtools [84], separated by strand, truncated to their 5' and 3' 359 termini, and output as BED6 files. Peak regions denoting TSS and CPAS were identified using 360 the HOMER [85] findpeaks module (-o auto -style tss) using a --localSize of 100 and 500 and --361 size of 15 and 50 for TSS and CPAS, respectively. TSS peaks were compared against Illumina 362 annotated splice sites to identify and remove peak artefacts derived from local alignment errors 363 around splice junctions. To predict CPAS sites on the viral genome, we also used the RNA-seq 364 aligner ContextMap2 (version 2.7.9) [67] which has poly(A) read mapping implemented on our 365 short-read data. To run this tool, we used the following optional flags \"-aligner_name bowtie --366 polyA --strandspecific\". Due to the previously reported errors when using ContextMap2 at very 367 high read depth, we chose to randomly subsample 10 million, 20 million and 30 million and run 368 the tool on each of the subsets. We only report poly(A) sites if they were called in all three 369 replicates and in at least two of the subsample groups. 370 371 Splice junction correction and sequence read collapsing 372 Illumina-assisted correction of splice junctions in direct RNA-Seq data was performed 373 using FLAIR v1.3 [69] in a stranded manner. Briefly, Illumina reads aligning to the Ad5 genome 374 were split according to orientation and mapping strand [ -f83 & -f163 (forward) and -f99 & -f147 375 (reverse) ] and used to produce strand-specific junction files that were filtered to remove junctions 376 supported by less than 100 Illumina reads. Direct RNA-Seq reads were similarly aligned to the 377 Ad5 genome and separated according to orientation [ -F4095 (forward) and -f16 (reverse) ] prior 378 to correction using the FLAIR correct module (default parameters). Resulting BED12 files were 379 parsed to extend the termini of each individual sequence read to the nearest TSS and CPAS with 380BlockStarts and BlockSizes (BED12 cols 11 & 12) corrected to reflect this. BED12 files were 381 subsequently collapsed by identifying all reads sharing the same BlockStarts and BlockSizes and 382 reducing these to a single representative. Resulting data were visualized along with the raw read 383 data using IGV [82] and low abundance isoforms (supported by less than 500 junctional reads or 384 10 full-length reads from Illumina or nanopore data, respectively) removed prior to producing the 385",

RNA-seq reveals high-confidence SNPs within the Ad5 genome. The 35,938 base 427 pair linear genome of Ad5 is displayed in the traditional left to right format. Major transcriptional 428 units are shown as boxes above or below the genome with arrowheads denoting the orientation 429 of the open reading frames (ORFs) encoded within. Grey boxes denote early gene transcriptional 430units while black boxes denote late genes. Bcftools was used to analyze short-read RNA seq data 431to predict single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) that 432 approach 100% of the RNA reads when compared to the reference Ad5 genome (AC_000008).433In total, 23 such SNPs were discovered and their position within the genome is highlighted by a 434 red vertical line. For each SNP, the nucleotide position as well as the top strand reference base 435and corrected base are shown in black text (nucleotide position, reference base -> corrected 436 base). If indicated SNPs fell within untranslated regions (UTR), or did not change the encoded 437 amino acid of any annotated reading frame potentially impacted by the SNP, these were marked 438with blue text denoting either UTR or Syn (synonymous mutation), respectively. For any SNP that 439 led to an amino acid change within an annotated ORF, these ORFs as well as the identity of the 440 reference amino acid and corrected amino acid are highlighted in red.",

            "text": ". Additionally, AdV encodes two Pol III-derived 74 virus associated (VA) RNAs involved in the inactivation of Protein Kinase acting on RNA (PKR) 75 [34,35]. Ultimately, the concerted efforts of the AdV early proteins lead to a cellular state that 76 allows for the replication and amplification of the viral DNA genome [36]. 77 Prior to viral DNA replication, the AdV Major Late Promoter (MLP) is thought to be largely 78 silent with small amounts of RNA being made that terminate at the immediately downstream (L1) 79 polyadenylation site [37]. At this time, so-called intermediate genes pIX and IVa2 begin to be 80 expressed from promoters within the E1B cassette and antisense to the MLP. Both pIX and IVa2 81 co-terminate at polyadenylation sites within the early genes they overlap with (E1B and E2B, 82 respectively) and are involved in late gene transcription and packaging [38,39]. Only after viral 83 DNA replication has occurred does the MLP fully activate, supporting the hypothesis that that84 active replication in cis is a prerequisite for full viral late gene expression [40-42]. The Major Late 85 Transcriptional Unit (MLTU) begins with a series of three constitutive exons spliced together to 86 form the tripartite leader, before downstream splicing to late cassettes defined by one of five 87 alternative polyadenylation sites (termed L1-L5) [37]. Splicing within the tripartite leader to the so-88 called \"i\" exon leads to a putative ORF upstream of subsequent late gene splicing events and 89 destabilizes these RNA molecules [43,44]. An additional intermediate promoter has been reported 90 within the L4 region that allows for the early expression of L4-22K and L4-33K proteins important 91 for the splicing of other late genes [45,46]. The MLTU encodes for primarily structural capsid 92 components or proteins involved with packaging of new virions, and their expression ultimately 93 leads to the death of the host cell. Recently, a novel late gene, UXP, was discovered on the 94 reverse strand of the genome [47,48]. The UXP promoter is located between E4 and E2 on the 95 reverse strand of the genome, and splices downstream to the exons within the E2A region to 96 continue translation of an ORF in an alternate reading frame to that of DBP. This exciting finding 97 suggests that our knowledge of AdV transcripts is incomplete, especially within the complex 98 The Ad5 genome was fully sequenced in 1991 using Sanger sequencing of viral genome 100 fragments inserted into plasmid DNA and amplified in bacteria [3]. This genome sequence was 101 then annotated in 2003 based on homology to similar serotypes of AdV [4]. As such, the current 102 reference annotation for Ad5 available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information 103 (AC_000008) is incomplete, and lacks critical information such as transcription start sites (TSS), 104 cleavage and polyadenylation sites (CPAS), and the resulting 5' and 3' untranslated regions 105 (UTR) that the aforementioned information dictates. In recent years, new technologies have 106 allowed for high-throughput investigation of gene expression utilizing various techniques. The 107 effect of AdV infection on host gene expression has been shown for Ad5 by microarray analysis 108 [49,50], as well as for Ad2 by Illumina-based short-read sequencing [51,52]. Analyses of both 109 single-end and paired-end short-read RNA-seq data from cells infected with Ad2 revealed both 110 temporal viral gene expression and high-depth splicing information and identified both previously 111 confirmed and novel RNA splice site junctions [53]. In addition. temporal analysis of Ad5 viral 112 gene expression was performed using digital PCR to determine expression kinetics of a subset 113 of known viral genes [54]. Lastly, the late RNA tripartite leader splicing was analyzed by short-114 read sequencing across a number of human AdV serotypes [43]. To date, no group has performed 115 a comprehensive analysis of the RNAs generated during Ad5 infection. Furthermore, even though 116",

Due to the spurious nature of low-level AdV splicing 200 events [53], we set abundance thresholds for the highly abundant viral late transcripts of 500 201 reads for short-read junctions, and at least ten events detected in the long-read sequencing when 202 collapsed by FLAIR [69]. Using this method, we readily detected other recently discovered viral 203 isoforms, such as multiple splice sites preceding the pVII ORF [53], the so-called X, Y, and Z 204 leaders embedded in E3 and preceding L5-Fiber [53,70], and the newly described UXP [47,48]. 205",

            "text": "primary amino acid sequence is critical for downstream analysis of mass spectrometry data[76].While the SNPs we detected might be bona fide mutations that have arisen during passage in cell 266 culture, it is also possible that the original reference sequence contains errors introduced by the 267 sequencing technologies employed at the time[3,4]. It will be critical to directly sequence the DNA 268 genomes of Ad5 isolates from multiple laboratories to test this hypothesis.Previous studies of AdV transcription detected numerous splice sites beyond those 270 employed by known isoforms. However, the constraints of short-read sequencing precluded 271proper assembly of these sites into full-length transcripts[43,53,70]. Furthermore, targeted 272 expression analysis over a time-course of infection was limited to already known transcripts[54]. 273Using direct RNA sequencing we have been able to confirm that these RNAs exist (e.g., the274 various x, y, and z leaders preceding some molecules of Fiber transcripts), as well as show 275 regulated expression over a time-course of infection. We have also added ORF predictions to 276 previously detected splice sites, such as L2-Unk13K, X-Z-Fiber, and the pVIII ORF derived from 277 splicing directly from the tripartite leader to the L4-33K splice acceptor. While this last site was 278 previously predicted to lead to the expression of a small 42 amino acid ORF [53], we propose that 279 this transcript instead primarily encodes for pVIII with a small upstream ORF, as it is over five 280 times as abundant as the canonical pVIII spliced RNA. It should be noted that we did not detect 281 the presence of a putative L4 intermediate promoter TSS at either 12 or 24 hpi [45,77,78]. One 282 hypothesis is that the sequence detected in L4-100K that is necessary for early expression of L4-283 22K and L4-33K might instead encode for a cis-regulatory element that mediates the early 284 accumulation of these two products produced from the major late promoter. Of the novel transcripts we have so far detected, all of them appear to display delayed late 286 kinetics during infection. Of particular interest is the transcript encoding for a putative fusion event 287 between the E4 transcriptional unit and the E2 transcriptional unit. This transcript, E4orf6/DBP, 288 would have to skip the canonical E4 CPAS for the pre-mRNA to progress downstream to DBP for 289 splicing. The three transcripts displaying this pattern, including E4-promoter driven DBP and 290 frameshifted E4-Unk, are all much more abundant during the late phase of infection even though 291 canonical E4 transcripts are expressed early. It will be very interesting to see if differential 292 polyadenylation is regulated during the life cycle of the virus, as has been previously reported for 293 herpes simplex virus [57,74,79]. Importantly, future research should identify whether the known 294 functions of existing viral ORFs can be explained, at least in part, by the presence of these novel 295 A549 cells (ATCC CCL-185) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection 299 (ATCC) and cultured at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.
