The surface form of the cells at advanced infection displayed prolific pseudopodia that, in addition to the rest of the plasma membrane, were also active sites of virus release. High magnification of the maturing virus particles showed a rosette appearance with short knoblike spikes under both the scanning electron and atomic force microscopes. The final expulsion step of the maturing virus particles seemed to result in some disruptions to the plasma membrane. The cytoskeletal network along the edge of the infected cells was enhanced and could be involved in transporting and expelling the progeny virus particles. Thickening of the actin filaments at the cell edge provided the bending force to extrude the virus particles.",

Sequence analyses of various isolates have indicated that the virus is genetically distinct from all known coronaviruses (5) (6) (7) . Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) does not fit in the three currently known groups of coronaviruses (1, 5, 6, 8) , which suggests that this is a new virus, not a result of mutation or recombination of known coronaviruses.",

These membrane whorls are postulated to be replication complexes for the virus since they appear very early (within 30 min) after infection.

The coverslips were then washed with distilled water and dehydrated through a series of increasing concentration (25%-100%) of ethanol. Cells on the coverslips were further subjected to critical point drying for 1.5 h and left in a 37\u00b0C oven overnight. Subsequently, the cells on the coverslips were sputter coated with gold (thickness of 10 nm) and viewed under the XL30 Field Emission Gun scanning electron microscope (FEI Company, Enidhoven, the Netherlands) at 10 kV.",

The SARS-CoV knobby/rosettelike structures were seen in a three-dimensional form under the scanning electron and atomic microscopy ( Figures 2B,  4C-online) . The spikes seemed shorter (16-17 nm) than those of other coronaviruses. At this stage, it is speculative if this could be due to the lack of the hemagglutininesterase protein (8, 35) in the spike glycoprotein of this Although the scanning electron microscope was able to show virus particles in the process of extruding ( Figure  2B , Figure 3A and B) from the cells, the image derived with the atomic force microscope was superior in resolution. A virus particle was seen pushing out of the cell plas-ma membrane ( Figure 4A ), which resulted in localized loss of membrane integrity at the site. Since prolific extrusion of the progeny virus particles occurred at this late stage of infection, the frequent loss of plasma membrane integrity could compromise the physiologic status of the infected cells and lead to cell death.",

This feature was not obvious under the transmission electron microscopy (11) . Subcellular imaging of the thickened edge of the cells showed numerous progeny virus particles awaiting extrusion ( Figure 6B, arrows) . The actin filaments that were parallel to the cell edge appeared to have thickened ( Figures 7A and B compared to Figures 1A and lB) . The enhanced presence of the actin filaments could assist in providing the bending force to expel the progeny virus particles to the exterior. Bohn and colleagues (36) suggested that the forces resulting from the vectorial growth of the actin filaments contributed to membrane bending at the site of virus maturation. Actin filaments have also been reported to be directly involved in the budding of both enveloped DNA and RNA viruses (37) (38) (39) (40) .",

In addition to the large amount of extracellular virus particles on most cells, proliferation of the pseudopodia in the infected cells was pronounced(Figure 2Acompared toFigure 1). These pseudopodia increase the surface area of the cells as active maturation sites of virus (Figures 3A and 3B).",
