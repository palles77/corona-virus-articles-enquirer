If not properly accounted for, recombination can compromise many evolutionary analyses. In addition, when dealing with organisms that are not obligately sexually reproducing, recombination gives insight into the rate at which distinct genetic lineages come into contact. Since June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 1106 laboratory-confirmed infections, with 421 MERS-CoV associated deaths as of April 16, 2015. Although bats are considered as the likely ultimate source of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, dromedary camels have been consistently implicated as the source of current human infections in the Middle East. In this paper we use phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that MERS-CoV genome has likely undergone numerous recombinations recently. Recombination in MERS-CoV implies frequent co-infection with distinct lineages of MERS-CoV, probably in camels given the current understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology.",

For some outbreaks there is little reason to suspect recombination, e.g. negative sense single stranded RNA viruses are thought to recombine over evolutionary, not population-level, time scales (Chare et al., 2003) . Observable recombination in RNA viruses requires that two conditions are met: that viruses from distinct lineages co-infect a host and that a mechanism for recombination exists. For example, even though influenza A virus co-infection is extremely common in birds based on genome segment reassortment patterns (Li et al., 2004; Dong et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2014) , recombination is extremely rare or absent (Chare et al., 2003; Boni et al., 2010) . This is thought to be because template switching (Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986; Baric et al., 1987) , the main mechanism of recombination in RNA viruses, is mechanistically difficult for single stranded negative sense RNA viruses (see Chare et al. 2003) , and for influenza A viruses has only been convincingly shown in cell culture under extreme conditions (Mitnaul et al., 2000) . When the genomic architecture of a virus is permissive to recombination, i.e. template switching occurs and is detectable, the extent of recombination is informative of co-infection and/or duration of infection.",

            "text": "Here we focus our attention on the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Zaki et al., 2012) , a recent zoonotic infection with a relatively high case fatality ratio (Cauchemez et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2013; Assiri et al., 2013) . Most human infections with MERS-CoV are thought to be the result of contact with Camelus dromedarius L., the dromedary camel, which is the presumed host of the virus. MERS-CoV, much like Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is likely ultimately derived from bats (Corman et al., 2014a) . MERS-CoV, along with Murine hepatitis virus and SARS-CoV, belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus. Betacoronavirus, as well as two other genera (Alpha-and Gammacoronavirus) out of four within the subfamily Coronavirinae have been shown to recombine in cell culture, in vivo and in eggs (Lai et al., 1985; Makino et al., 1986; Keck et al., 1988; Kottier et al., 1995; Herrewegh et al., 1998) . Additionally, a coronavirus lineage related to MERS-CoV which was isolated from bats appears to have recombined around the spike (S) protein (Corman et al., 2014a) . In this paper we show that although the genome of MERS-CoV contains considerable amounts of rate heterogeneity between genomic regions that can interfere with detection of recombination, we do nonetheless find evidence of sustained recombination that cannot be explained by rate heterogeneity alone. This has two important consequences: one is that care has to be taken when constructing phylogenetic trees of MERS-CoV as a single tree cannot accurately describe the complete history of all loci within a recombining genome. Secondly and more importantly, the observed rates of recombination in the MERS-CoV genome is evidence of a large number of MERS-CoV co-infections in some hosts which has implications for understanding the dynamics of the virus in the animal reservoir.",

Two replicate datasets were generated for each category of rate heterogeneity. Other than that all simulations were run under a relaxed lognormal molecular clock (Drummond et al., 2006) with standard deviation set to 7.42\u00d710 \u22127 , HKY substitution model (Hasegawa et al., 1985) with the transition/transversion ratio parameter (\u03ba) set to 6.0 and \u0393-distributed rate heterogeneity with 4 categories and shape parameter 0.04 and empirical nucleotide frequencies, all derived from the results of the marginal likelihood analyses described earlier. A MERS-CoV sequence isolated from a camel (NRCE-HKU270) was provided as the starting state at the root. To include the effects of site-specific constraint we additionally carried out simulations under a Goldman-Yang codon model (Goldman and Yang, 1994) in \u03c0BUSS with empirical codon frequencies, \u03ba=6.0 and dN/dS (\u03c9) set to 0.1 (i.e. purifying selection) under same levels of rate heterogeneity and on the same phylogeny as the simulations described above. As these sequences were simulated on a tree of MERS-CoV, we refer to these datasets as being empirically simulated.

Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches to ancestral sequence reconstruction converge on similar patterns of homoplasy density (figures 3 and S7). Both methods identify the region around the S (spike) protein as having a high density of synonymous homoplasies. Empirically simulated sequences showed that homoplasies are not that unlikely in the absence of recombination. All sequences empirically simulated in \u03c0BUSS under a nucleotide substitution model had 2-fold homoplasies ranging in frequency from 0.0222 to 0.0550 of all polymorphic sites, with sequences simulated under higher levels of rate heterogeneity having more homoplasies and higher homoplasy degrees (figure 4). However, even under a caricature model of rate heterogeneity we did not reach the same degree of homoplasy as that observed in MERS-CoV, where homoplasic sites comprise as much as 0.1447 of all polymorphic sites and reach homoplasy degrees as high as 4. We were able to recover similar proportions of homoplasic sites from empirical simulations under a codon model (ranging from 0.0821 to 0.1518 of all polymorphic sites), but only under unrealistic values of rate heterogeneity. Even then, the distributions of homoplasy degrees for all simulated datasets are heavily skewed towards low homoplasy degrees, whereas the homoplasy degree distribution for MERS-CoV has a longer tail, indicating that homoplasies are more repeatable across the phylogeny. Additional tests for excessive homoplasies, PHI and 3Seq also identify MERS-CoV sequences as being recombinant, albeit both spuriously identify some of the simulated datasets as recombinant (see figure S10 ).

As such, we considered that the inference of a breakpoint in the MERS-CoV genome could be caused by systematic rate heterogeneity, which we address by evaluating rate heterogeneity across the first breakpoint 13 .

A maximum likelihood phylogeny of 85 MERS-CoV sequences with maximum likelihood-mapped mutations. Synapomorphies are shown as coloured ticks (coloured by coding sequence in which they occur) on branches where they occur. Homoplasies are shown as circles connected with coloured lines, colour corresponds with the coding sequence in which the mutation has occured. Mutations are positioned on the branches in proportion to where the mutation occurs in the genome, e.g. mutations shown towards the end of a branch correspond to mutations near the 3' terminus of the genome. Arrows at the top indicate the order, relative length and names of coding sequences within the MERS-CoV genome. in BEAST. We estimate an empirical rate heterogeneity ratio between MERS-CoV genome positions 23723-30126 and 1-23722 to be on the order between 1.3 and 1.5 (see figure S2 ). However, the support for this first breakpoint in MERS-CoV is comparable to support for empirically simulated sequences with 2-fold rate heterogeneity, and breakpoints under MERS-like levels of rate heterogeneity are difficult to detect. Overall, this suggests that evidence for differences in likelihoods between MERS fragments 1 and 2 are beyond what would be expected from rate heterogeneity alone.",

Through sequence simulation we also confirmed that both the numbers of homoplasic sites and their homoplasy degrees in MERS-CoV genomes are excessive, even when compared to unrealistic scenarios (e.g. 3-fold rate heterogeneity, see figure 4 ). Homoplasies become increasingly more prevalent when a more realistic codon model is used, due to differences in codon position constraint. Even then, MERS-CoV genomes possess mutations with much higher homoplasy degrees, surpassing simulated datasets with caricature levels of rate heterogeneity. This makes sense under a recombination scenario, as alleles persist in a diverse population and get recombined into novel backgrounds repeatedly, giving an appearance of highly repeatable mutations. Nevertheless, substitution patterns in real genomes are often highly complex and homoplasy-based methods have been shown to be susceptible to rate heterogeneity across sites, especially under higher levels of sequence divergence (Posada and Crandall, 2001) . Although rate heterogeneity certainly exists in MERS-CoV data, the divergence levels are still quite low (\u03b8/site = 0.0047), giving us some degree of certainty in our inference of homoplasies. It is also reassuring that both maximum likelihood and Bayesian sequence reconstruction converged on similar patterns of homoplasy and synapomorphy across the genome (figures 3 and S7). This is important, since homoplasies inferred using BEAST are integrated over all possible tree topologies, whereas homoplasies inferred by maximum likelihood were conditioned on a single tree. The convergence between these two methods suggests that the data contain enough phylogenetic signal to recover what could be called a \"true\" tree and that homoplasies, for the most part, can be correctly identified as such.",

The vast majority of homoplasies that we observe, however, occur on their own. Recombination tracts, rather than single template switches are not uncommon in other coronaviruses (Keck et al., 1988; Kottier et al., 1995; Herrewegh et al., 1998) .

At first this may seem paradoxical, but we believe this result is due to the combined effects of the way homoplasious sites are distributed across the genome and phylogenetic tree of MERS-CoV (figure 6) and the number of parameters involved. A speckled pattern of homoplasious sites without phylogenetic signal could easily be overwhelmed by the signal coming from the sites that support what could be called \"the one true tree\", i.e. the clonal frame, in the data. Secondly, each phylogenetic tree contains at least n-1 free parameters, so it is not surprising then that models attempting to recover 2 independent trees for both genomic fragments resulting from alternative tree topology analysis of MERS-CoV with highly correlated genealogies are penalized for the extra parameters introduced by a second tree. We would additionally like to point out that the fit of models including relaxed molecular clocks result in dramatic improvements to model fit compared to models with strict molecular clocks (log BF>15, figure 5 ). Although this could be interpreted as evidence for a considerable degree of lineage rate heterogeneity, the more parsimonious explanation is the ability of a relaxed molecular clock to accommodate homoplasies of recombinant origin, which do not necessarily accumulate at a relatively constant rate like genuine de novo mutations do.",

Marginal likelihood analyses indicate that estimating independent molecular clocks after partitioning the MERS-CoV genome into 2 fragments alone substantially increases model fit over a completely linked (trees and clocks) model (log Bayes factor \u224818). This highlights the advantage of employing relaxed molecular clocks, as in our case the method is clearly capable of accomodating recombination in an otherwise entirely clonal analysis framework. In addition, previous studies of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats have identified recombination breakpoints in small numbers of isolates falling close to the \"transition zone\" around site 22000 (Hon et al., 2008; Lau et al., 2010) which in our analysis of MERS-CoV is where GARD, LDhat and BEAST identify changes in the underlying model of evolution (figures 1, S5 and 3).

For this to occur different lineages of the virus must encounter each other often and implies frequent co-infection with MERS-CoV. To date it is difficult to ascertain whether the human infections with MERS-CoV are a result of substantial asymptomatic transmission amongst humans, or repeated zoonosis of the virus from camels to humans or a combination thereof. Given the severity of MERS we find it unlikely that humans could be sufficiently frequently co-infected with two or more different lineages of the virus. Previous serological studies have failed to find evidence of prevalent past MERS-CoV infections of humans (Gierer et al., 2013; Aburizaiza et al., 2013) , although a recent nation-wide study in Saudi Arabia has detected non-negligible numbers of individuals with antibodies against MERS-CoV, especially amongst shepherds and slaughterhouse workers (M\u00fcller et al., 2015) . We thus propose that MERS-CoV mostly infects, and recombines, in camels. A study by Adney et al. (2014) has shown that camels only suffer mild symptoms from MERS-CoV infection and numerous other studies indicate an extremely high prevalence of antibodies specific against MERS-CoV in camels (M\u00fcller et al., 2014; Corman et al., 2014b; Chu et al., 2014; Reusken et al., 2013 Reusken et al., , 2014 . At the same time, however, sequencing has not indicated the presence of multiple infection in camels, or any other animal. We believe that individual MERS-CoV co-infections are rare, but given the size of the epidemic in camels, as inferred from serology, the total number of co-infections is high. In addition, MERS-CoV infection is transient in camels Adney et al. (2014) and thus sequencing efforts, which have been insufficient and very limited in camels, are highly unlikely to capture a co-infection.",
