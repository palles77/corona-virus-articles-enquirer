The value of respiratory-related OTCs was less clear, but they may be useful in the surveillance of other respiratory viruses. Although the sales of gastrointestinal products have been shown to be a good marker for seasonal community norovirus infections (6), the value of pharmacosurveillance for outbreak-related enteric activity was less certain.",

One potential weakness is that it included only prescribed medications and OTCs from retail pharmacies not linked to health care institutions. For example, although Nova Scotia enteric outbreak data were robust, the majority of norovirus outbreaks captured during the study period occurred in long-term care facilities. Medications provided to long-term care facilities may have originated from pharmacies not contributing sales data to the pharmacy pilot project or perhaps bulk purchases by long-term care facilities were simply not captured in the data provided.",

Pharmacy prescription and OTC sales data provide greater timeliness and higher geographic resolution and national coverage than other health data currently used. Pharmacy sales data has been shown to support seasonal influenza and aid in decision-making for resource allocation. Prescription and OTC data also provide an earlier window of opportunity for intervention compared to using traditional data sources only. Furthermore, pharmacy data could be used to support surveillance and action for multiple public health purposes (e.g., mental health, physician prescription patterns and chronic illness) and by multiple agencies and different jurisdictions. As with other surveillance systems, investments in the necessary technological and analytical resources are required to conduct ongoing pharmacy-based syndromic surveillance.",
