Herein we describe the use of an adenovirus vectored mouse IFN alpha gene (mDEF201) as a prophylactic and treatment countermeasure in a SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mouse model. Complete survival protection was observed in mice given a single dose of mDEF201 administered intranasally 1, 3, 5, 7, or 14 days prior to lethal SARS-CoV challenge (p < 0.001), and body weights of these treated mice were unaffected by the challenge. In addition, low doses of mDEF201 protected lungs in a dose dependent manner as measured by a reduction in gross pathology. Intranasal treatment with mDEF201 ranging from 10 6 to 10 8 PFU significantly protected mice against a lethal SARS-CoV infection in a dose dependent manner up to 12 h post infection (p < 0.001). The data suggest that mDEF201 is a new class of antiviral agent further development as treatment for SARS-CoV infections.",

Notably, antibodies to the SARS-CoV spike protein have been shown to block entry (Sui et al., 2004) and small peptides derived from the heptad repeat (HR) regions of SARS-CoV S protein have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV infection by the interference of SARS-CoV fusion with target cells (Bosch et al., 2004; Ho et al., 2006) . In addition, the main protease of SARS-CoV, which is essential for the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, has been a key target for the development anti-SARS drugs Yang et al., 2003) . Antisense RNA and RNA interference (siRNA) technologies have shown potential in treating some severe diseases including SARS-CoV infection (Ahlquist, 2002; Gibson, 1994; Johnson-Saliba and Jans, 2001; Leonard and Schaffer, 2006) . Using siRNAs to inhibit SARS-CoV infection in Rhesus macaques, it has been demonstrated that siRNAs are effective both prophylactically and therapeutically in vivo (Chang et al., 2007) . This effect was likely due to virus specific inhibition and not due to induction of interferon because the siSC2-5 and siCONa-b used in the study contained neither the 5 -UGUGU-3 nor the 5 -GUCCUUCAA-3 motifs suspected to be immunostimulatory elements when used with transfection reagents (Judge et al., 2005) . In addition, there are also significant concerns with regard to toxicity issues and the use of siRNAs (Frantz, 2006) .",

            "text": "Recombinant interferons have been extensively researched for their therapeutic properties. IFN-\u2423 is an effective and safe recombinant human protein with broad clinical appeal (Brassard et al., 2002) . However, while recombinant IFN-\u2423 has great therapeutic value, its usefulness is hindered by its short half-life. The terminal half-life of interferon alfacon 1 following subcutaneous dosing was 1.3 h in golden Syrian hamsters and 3.4 h in rhesus monkeys (Blatt et al., 1996) . Due to rapid decay, multiple injections are required. To address the rapid degradation, PEGylated rIFN-\u2423 have been introduced with half-lives that are on the order of days instead of hours, thus reducing the number of injections to once per week (Bell et al., 2008) . To circumvent the fast in vivo decay of rIFN-\u2423, we developed a Adenovirus5 (Ad5) gene delivery platform to deliver the mouse IFN-\u2423 gene (subtype 5) that constitutively drives IFN-\u2423 production in situ. As IFN is species specific, the mouse IFN gene was required, and is denoted as Ad5-mIFN-\u2423 (or mDEF201). mDEF201 has normally been delivered intranasally, as studies have suggested that intranasal administration will prevent the host immune system from recognizing the Ad5 vector, thereby bypassing any pre-existing immunity present in the clinical scenario (Croyle et al., 2008) . In addition, intranasal administration allows for needle-free dosing, which reduces the need for medical personnel, thereby facilitating mass distribution in the event of an epidemic (Weaver and Barry, 2008) . The Ad5-mIFN-\u2423 has been shown by Defense Research and Development Canada (DRDC, Suffield) to provide both pre-and post-exposure protection against Western Equine Encephalitis virus (WEEV) (Wu et al., 2007) . Thus, their findings illustrated the functionality of the mDEF201 system in a murine model, and suggested that adenovirus-mediated expression of IFN-\u2423 could be an alternative approach for the prevention and treatment of other viral infections.",

In the structural genes, the Y436H mutation in the v2163 spike region was conserved in strain MA15, and the M-mutation was in a similar location on both lethal strains (S6L for v2163, E11K in MA15). In the replicase genes, the nsp9 mutation (E4185D) was located near an nsp9 mutation (T4184A) found in strain MA15, and both lethal strains had an nsp13 mutation.

Virus-infected cells usually cause the activation of several transcription factors, such as IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), which play a central role in downstream gene activation (Lin et al., 1998) . Once IFN is synthesized and secreted from the cells, it binds to cell surface receptors and induces transcription, which results in an anti-viral state in the target cells. However, the production of IFN type I by SARS-CoV-infected cells is limited (Chen and Subbarao, 2007; Spiegel et al., 2005) and neither endogenous IFN transcripts nor IFN promoter activity are detected (Spiegel et al., 2005) . This lack of IFN activity has been attributed to proteins, perhaps virion and non-structural proteins of the SARS-CoV, which antagonize IFN and block transcription factors necessary for the expression of IFN (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) .",

The nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS-CoV has been shown to inhibit IFN-beta (IFN-\u2424) induced by poly IC (Lu et al., 2009) . In that study, the authors found that the N protein inhibition of IFN-\u2424 production was not due to overexpression of downstream signaling molecules of the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-or the RIG-I-like receptors (RLR)-dependent pathways. It was likely that SARS-CoV N protein targeted the initial step, probably the cellular PRRs (pattern recognition receptors)-RNAs-recognition step in the innate immune pathways, to suppress IFN expression responses (Lu et al., 2009 ). In addition, a nonstructural protein of SARS-CoV, nsp1, also has been found to modulate interferon induction. The nsp1 protein has been shown to suppress type I interferon production, by promoting host mRNA degradation and inhibiting host translation in infected cells (Kamitani et al., 2009 ). Yet despite these inhibitory molecules, the virus remains susceptible to exogenous IFNs (Chen and Subbarao, 2007) . It is interesting that neither of these wild type virus gene products that modulate IFN pathways or IFN expression were altered in the mouse adapted Urbani strain of SARS-CoV used in the current study (Day et al., 2009) .",

            "text": "IFN-\u2423/\u2424 have previously been shown to be effective against SARS-CoV infection . In vitro studies report a potent inhibition of SARS-CoV infection and replication by exogenous IFN-\u2424, and, less efficiently by IFN-\u2423 (Chen et al., 2004; Cinatl et al., 2003; Dahl et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2004) . In terms of IFN inducers, we recently reported that intranasal treatment with poly ICLC protected mice against a lethal mouse-adapted SARS-CoV infection with reduced viral load in the lungs (Kumaki et al., 2010) . Poly ICLC was effective when therapy was initiated 24 h or more before infection or within 8 h after virus inoculation. In the current study, similar efficacy was achieved in protecting mice against death not only with the interferon inducer but also with mDEF201 vector that constitutively expresses interferon, but also without substantially reducing viral lung titers. Similar results were obtaineod by others when using interferon to treat SARS infections (Str\u00f6her et al., 2004; Smits et al., 2010) . In this regard, its worth noting that mice infected with non-mouse adapted strains of SARS-CoV always support vigorous replication of virus in the lungs with virus lung titers peaking at 24 h post virus exposure and continuing to remain at comparable levels through day 3 or 4 of the infection. At day 6 of the infection, virus replication ceases or dramatically slows down and virus is cleared within 1 or two days thereafter (Subbarao et al., 2004; Rockx et al., 2009) . All the while, no pathogenesis is detectable. It could be that in the current study later induction of other interferon pathways upregulated by meDEF1 are sufficient to control damage to host and yet allow a certain amount of virus replication. For example, despite virus sensitivity to IFN-\u2423/\u2424 , SARS-CoV still replicates rapidly in lungs in mice as previously mentioned. It has previously been shown that, in non-lymphatic cells infected with SARS-CoV, neither dimerization nor stable nuclear accumulation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) occurs (Spiegel et al., 2005) . IRF-3 is a protein with a key role in the transactivation of the IFN-\u2424 promoter. In addition, the initial production of interferon normally triggers expression of a related factor, IRF-7, but not in a SARS-CoV infection (Honda et al., 2005; Kuri et al. (2009) . In the latter study, Kuri et al. (2009) recently showed results that suggest that interferon produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells could enable cells to launch a host response to SARS-CoV, that IRF-3 and IRF-7 may be active at subdetectable levels and still function to promote interferon responses, and that SARS-CoV infection does not activate IRF-7. Thus, active IRF-7 and IRF-3 might be necessary to reduce virus lung titers early in the infection, but later induction of other interferon pathways might be sufficient to control the damaging effects of virus replication in the lung triggered by a virus-induced a cytokine storm and ARD (Rockx et al., 2009; Smits et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "What advantage does mDEF-1 have over other methods of interferon delivery? Paragas et al. (2005) reported that IFN-alfacon 1 had anti-SARS-CoV activity only prior to infection in a cell-based model in vitro. In this case, IFN-alfacon 1 likely induced an antiviral state in the target cells, which produced a cellular environment that was not suitable for viral replication. However, IFN-alfacon 1 did not protect the cells when added post infection, whereas mDEF201 afforded compete survival even when added 12 h after virus infection and gave partial protection at very high doses out to 24 h post virus exposure. This illustrates the benefit of constitutive expression of interferon using the AD5 vector. Further studies need to be conducted in which direct comparisons of IFN protein and mDEF201 to elucidate this further. In addition, it is likely that lower doses given over a period of weeks, as is the case for the DEF201 concept, could counter the rapid degradation and toxicity associated with bolus dosing of interferon. Thus, the benefits of the mDEF201 approach over conventional therapy with recombinant human IFN or interferon inducers include: (a) single, intranasal dose vs. repeated injected dosing and (b) an extended therapeutic window. These benefits, if extrapolated to a clinical setting, could have utility during a large-scale SARS epidemic as a post-exposure prophylactic or treatment as it facilitates quick and easy dissemination to an at-risk population, such as medical chain workers. In short, this approach retains the proven clinical benefits of IFN-\u2423 in managing SARS-CoV infections, but overcomes the short half-life limitations of exogenous IFN or IFN inducers. More broadly, given the efficacy profile of mDEF201 shown here and that of Wu et al. (2007) , mDEF201 has significant potential as a broad spectrum, host-directed antiviral.",

To address this issue Defyrus has developed a technology that utilizes the Adenovirus5 (Ad5) gene delivery platform to deliver the human IFN-alpha gene that drives IFN-alpha production in situ. The intranasal (i.n.) administration of the Ad5-IFN-a prevents its recognition by the host immune system. In addition, the shelf-stable, powdered formulation administered i.n. allows for easy storage and administration in the event of the need for mass distribution.",
