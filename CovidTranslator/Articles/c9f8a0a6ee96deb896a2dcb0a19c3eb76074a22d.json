KEYWORDS High-consequence pathogens continue to emerge or re-emerge globally, leading to increased public health concerns about potential pandemics [1] . Current human viral disease outbreaks of concern include an ongoing Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa [2] , avian influenza caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype (H7N9) in China [3] , enterovirus D68 infections in the USA [4] and the topic of this review, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (2012present) [5] . Emerging infections often first present as limited disease outbreaks caused by rare or unknown pathogens, increasing the likelihood that their significance is overlooked. Consequently, financial resources are routed toward other infectious diseases that are deemed more 'pressing' at a given time. Examples of rare agents that caused very few human infections for many years, only to then erupt in outbreaks involving thousands are: Rift Valley fever virus (more than 100,000 cases from 1930 to 2015) [6] and Ebola virus (1581 cases and 1136 deaths since its discovery in 1976 until late 2013; 24,701 cases and 10,194 deaths from December 2013 to March 18, 2015) [2] . Other agents, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), emerge unexpectedly and eventually cause large epidemics (8096 cases and 774 deaths), only to seemingly disappear again [7] . Consequently, global public health professionals are challenged with the ever more important task of rapidly developing improved methods for infectious disease detection, surveillance, control, prevention and containment.",

From antivirals to monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and vaccines [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , in vitro and in vivo preclinical testing led us to the same predicament that the scientific community faced during the SARS epidemic. Laboratory research is all too often inefficiently translated into clinical testing of candidate therapeutics and prophylactics, delaying clinical licensure by the authorities and final administration during outbreaks. Here we summarize and evaluate the progress made in MERS vaccine development to provide an example of various challenges that are encountered on the path to medical countermeasure licensure.",

Soon after the index case was detected, more and more people were identified who suffered of the same ailment [20, 21] . The majority of MERS infections were reported from Western Asia (in particular from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but also from Jordan, Lebanon, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Yemen). Later, MERS was also diagnosed in Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, UK), Northern Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia), Northern America (USA), southeastern Asia (Malaysia, Philippines) and southern Asia (Iran) among people with a travel history to Western Asia [5] .",

The risk of virus transmission is substantially greater from index cases than from secondary cases [22] . The increasing distribution of MERS cases within the Arabian Peninsula is worrisome. For instance, for the past 2 years, concerns about the initiation of a MERS pandemic prompted travel restrictions to Makkah, Saudi Arabia, for millions of Muslim pilgrims, preventing tens of thousands of potential travelers from making the religiously significant Hajj journey. Although a major outbreak of MERS has not occurred as a direct result of recent Hajjes, trepidations remained high [23, 24] .",

However, increasing evidence of subclinical infections [30] suggests that the actual number of human MERS cases is much higher than the currently confirmed number.

One-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) are currently suspected to be the animals from which MERS-CoV is transmitted to humans. This suspicion stems from the detection of MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies in one-humped camel herds of Egypt [ and United Arab Emirates [41, 42] . MERS-CoV or MERS-CoVlike genome fragments and coding-complete genomes, highly similar to human MERS-CoV genomes, were detected in one-humped camels [38, 39, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] , and MERS-CoV was directly isolated from several one-humped camels and grown in tissue culture [39, 49, 50] . One-humped camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV develop only minor clinical signs of respiratory disease, but MERS-CoV replicates in the upper airways [51] . Serologic evidence for MERS-CoV infection was not found in people with potential exposure to infected one-humped camels in three serosurveys [39, 52, 53] . Therefore, zoonotic transmission from one-humped camels to people might be a rare event.",

It is, therefore, possible that MERS-CoV is widely distributed among one-humped camels, but that particular genotype of the virus had to evolve to allow a jump into the human population. A genomic study, indeed, revealed the presence of several genetic variants of MERS-CoV in individual one-humped camels, whereas MERS-CoV in humans exposed to these onehumped camels appears to be infected with clonal MERS-CoV populations [44] .

More infrequently, patients develop chest pain, headaches, hemoptysis, myalgia and/or sore throat. In severe cases, the illness can quickly progress to severe atypical pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe hypoxemic respiratory failure [20, 26, 28, 29, 69] . MERS often includes extrapulmonary manifestations involving the circulatory, renal and/or gastrointestinal systems (abdominal pain/nausea, diarrhea, emesis) that can rapidly advance to septic shock, renal failure or refractory multiple organ failure [20, 28, 70] . Chest x-ray or computed tomography imaging often reveals subtle to extensive unilateral or bilateral abnormalities, such as consolidation, increased bronchovascular markings, pleural or bronchial wall thickening, reticulonodular airspace opacities or cardiomegaly. Clinical chemistry is characterized by increased alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase concentrations in some patients and increased L-lactate dehydrogenase concentration in about 50% of the cases. Low albumin and hemoglobin concentrations are frequent findings, as are lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, whereas lymphocytosis occurs more rarely [20, 26, 28, 29, 69] . Viral loads are usually high in the respiratory tract (reaching >10 6 genome copies/ml) but may be low or absent in the blood [28, 69, 70] .",

However, a true cost-to-benefit analysis must be performed to determine if vaccine development efforts will provide benefit. If we assume that MERS cases continue at the rate of roughly 450 per year with a 62% hospitalization rate [77] and that the additional cost per in-patient is approximately US$714,000 on average (cumulative average cost per day per intervention per in-patient multiplied by median stay per respective intervention), the cost of developing the vaccine would be justified within 2.5 years (FIGURE 2) . Therefore, if sustained human-to-human MERS-CoV transmission were to occur, the benefit would outweigh the cost. In general, vaccine development is a worthwhile pursuit, and steps should be taken to expedite approval of safe and effective vaccines for emerging pathogens. Similar to many other coronaviruses, the major structural proteins, spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N), are the primary targets of the host antibody-mediated immune response and are the focus in vaccine development efforts. S is the surface glycoprotein of the MERS coronavirion. S mediates the attachment of the virion to target cells and its subsequent entry into the cell by fusing viral and host cell membranes [79] . These functions involve two distinct domains of S, referred to as S1 and S2, respectively. S1 contains the host cell receptor-binding domain [42, 80, 81] , which engages the primary MERS-CoV cell-surface receptor CD26/DPP4 [11] . S2 contains epitopes that are crossreactive with homologous epitopes of other group A and B betacoronaviruses [79, 82] , suggesting that the development of a general, multivalent, betacoronavirus vaccine might be possible. The E and the M work to secure the structural integrity of the virion. The nucleoprotein (N) encapsidates the viral genomic RNA [83] .",

Then, the human population could be educated to avoid the host or to implement proper safety measures when coming in contact with the reservoir. If contact with the reservoir host cannot be avoided (e.g., abundance, economic importance), vaccination of such a host may be a straightforward approach to prevent host-tohuman transmission. In addition, the development of an animal vaccine may ultimately be cheaper to produce and faster to achieve as regulatory hurdles to obtain licensure may not be as stringent as those in place for human vaccine development. For example, vaccination of wildlife reservoirs against rabies reduced human cases in the USA by 98% [84] . This strategy is also a relatively new pursuit for the eradication of tuberculosis in parts of Europe through vaccination of cattle and wildlife [85, 86] .",

Vaccination of one-humped camel herds could be feasible as these animals are often kept/raised/sold by humans, and wild animals could be identified relatively easily. However, some adult one-humped camels tested positive for MERS-CoV despite the presence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies [38, 39] , and pre-existing neutralizing anti-MERS-CoV antibodies do not necessarily protect against re-infection with MERS-CoV [39] . This observation suggests that camel vaccination may have to Review Papaneri, Johnson, Wada, Bollinger, Jahrling & Kuhn be repeated regularly or may not be effective at all. Probably even more unrealistic is the vaccination of bats due to sheer number of these relatively small and (dependent on species) often quite abundant animals. The absence of a clearly defined zoonotic virus ecology prompts researchers to contemplate development of human vaccines. As MERS tends to be acute and is not yet widespread, targeting specific human populations at high risk of infection for vaccination is a logical strategy for prevention or limitation of infections. Development and distribution of vaccines should, therefore, be expedited for one-humped camel handlers and herders, healthcare workers and veterinarians, and travelers to areas where MERS-CoV infection is prevalent. If widespread infection throughout the general population is expected, other high-risk populations (e.g., aged people, persons with cormorbidities) should be targeted for vaccination.",

Although the experiment involved a limited sample size, the data support the necessity of a Th1 response.

The authors demonstrated that interferon-a-and MyD88-deficient mice could not clear MERS-CoV as rapidly as wild-type mice. Similarly, T-cell and B-cell knockout mice could not clear the virus as efficiently as control mice. Furthermore, vaccinated mice had reduced viral titers, and serum transfer experiments provided protection against homologous MERS-CoV infection.

The ability to optimize for safety and immunogenicity via bioengineering is an obvious benefit. Using vaccine platforms such as adenoviruses [107] , vesiculoviruses [108] or MVA [109] [110] [111] [112] , the foreign gene of immunological interest can be inserted into a heterotypic viral genome with proven success as a vaccine. The recombinant virus will express the foreign protein, which will stimulate a protective immune response in the inoculated host. This approach has also been used successfully to develop multivalent vaccines. Such vaccines can confer protection against not only multiple variants or strains of the same pathogen but also multiple pathogens simultaneously [98, [113] [114] [115] . Recently, Escriou et al. showed evidence of bivalent protection of laboratory mice from measles virus and SARS-CoV infection [115] . For such constructs, codon optimization for host recognition may increase attenuation and protein expression, yielding greater safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. For instance, two vaccines, an MVA vaccine and an adenovirus-based vaccine, expressing codon-optimized MERS-CoV S elicited serum antibodies in laboratory mice that were used to neutralize MERS-CoV in vitro [111, 116] .",

Using immunoinformatics, Sharmin and Islam chose to focus on an epitope found in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is conserved across all human coronaviruses [125] . While blocking viral replication by affecting the RdRp may be effective in vitro, this method has yet to be proven effective in protecting a host from infection by an RNA virus. One drawback to this approach is that the RdRp epitopes may not be readily detected by the host immune system as the RdRp is usually not a major structural component of virions. Also, antigenic processing should lead to a wide range of T-cell and B-cell immunoreactive epitopes.

Initial experiments included screening of wild-type BALB/c and STAT-1 knockout laboratory mice for susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection and development of disease. However, the mice did not develop clinical signs of disease, and infectious virus could not be recovered [117] . Zhao et al. overcame this hurdle by transducing BALB/c mice with human CD26/DPP4 using an adenovirus construct [89] . Transduced mice were permissive to MERS-CoV infection and demonstrated minimal weight loss. However, candidate medical countermeasures in this mouse model can only be evaluated by comparing the changes in viral titer in the lungs at 4 days post-inoculation between treated and untreated animals. Transduction-based models may also prove quite variable due to infection efficacy of the transducing vector.",

MERS-CoV inoculation into rhesus monkeys gave varied results, leading to disease with limited similarity to human disease [72, 132, 133] For instance, a study by Yao et al. revealed that intratracheal inoculation of rhesus monkeys with MERS-CoV resulted in a nonlethal disease, and some limited pathology could be observed at 28 days post-inoculation [133] . de Wit et al. described a study of nonhuman primates following inoculation with a combination of intratracheal, intranasal, oral and conjunctival routes [132] . Rhesus monkeys were euthanized on days 3 and 6 post-inoculation with MERS-CoV and evaluated for virological, immunological and histopathological changes [132, 134] . At the euthanasia time points, the animals had signs of pneumonia, and replicating virus could be demonstrated in tissues and mucous membranes by quantitative PCR.

X-ray radiographs indicated lung infiltrates at days 3 and 5 post-inoculation, suggesting virusinduced lung disease. However, these two studies did not include mock-inoculated controls to demonstrate that the observed clinical signs were not due to generalized inflammation from inoculation and handling procedures. More recently, Falzarano et al. described intratracheal inoculation of common marmosets with MERS-CoV, which resulted in partially lethal disease [135] . However, the animals received a large volume bolus of MERS-CoV (0.5 ml) intratracheally, which was disproportionate based on the small lung volume (15-25 ml) of a common marmoset [JOHNSON RF, UNPUBLISHED OBSERVATION MEASURED BY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (N = 10)].

For instance, vaccine development against Ebola virus disease was overall a niche activity until the current 2013-2015 outbreak affected thousands of people. For any rare or emerging pathogen, costbenefit analyses for vaccine development must be calculated based on a limited knowledge of its pandemic and/or re-emergence potential. As the example of MERS-CoV shows, even with sparse economical data available, cost estimates as shown in FIGURE 2 warrant MERS vaccine development, as economic losses from even small infectious disease outbreaks far outweigh the costs associated with vaccine development. However, faster methods to move a candidate vaccine from the laboratory bench into the clinic are essential. Such on-demand acceleration strategies are in current evaluation, and support for these efforts should be advanced [137] [138] [139] . . The prediction of clinical trial success based on in vitro research results remains a major obstacle to timely vaccine development, particularly for vaccines against emerging diseases with high lethality as seen with MERS.",

(A) MERS-CoV is potentially transmitted by infected bats to African one-humped camels, which are often exported to the Arabian Peninsula. (B) Vaccination of one-humped camels could, therefore, prevent further transmission of the virus to humans and subsequent human-to-human transmission if one-humped camels are indeed the primary route of infection for humans. MERS: Middle East respiratory syndrome; MERS-CoV: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Middle East respiratory syndrome Review informahealthcare.com Overview of MERS-CoV genome & function of encoded proteins The emergence of MERS-CoV infection has spurred a conglomeration of traditional and novel vaccine strategies, the success of which hinges on a thorough understanding of the genetic makeup and mechanism of action of this virus. MERS-CoV is a member of the genus Betacoronavirus, subfamily Coronavirinae (Nidovirales: Coronaviridae) [78]. Like all nidoviruses, MERS-CoV has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, linear, monopartite genome. The MERS-CoV genome encodes 16 nonstructural proteins, 4 major structural proteins and 7 accessory structural proteins (TABLE 1) [31]. The nonstructural proteins, produced through proteolytic cleavage of two polyproteins coded from two open reading frames, are the major components of the polymerase complex and manage replication and transcription.",
