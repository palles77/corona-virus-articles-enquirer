            "text": "The objective was to describe the probability of Cryptosporidium parvum fecal oocyst shedding at different magnitudes of exposure, the pattern of fecal shedding over time, and factors affecting fecal shedding in dairy calves. Within the first 24 h of life, 36 calves were experimentally challenged with C. parvum oocysts at one of four possible magnitudes of oral exposure (1\u00d710 3 , 1\u00d710 4 , 1\u00d710 5 , and 1\u00d7 10 6 oocysts), and 7 control calves were sham dosed. Fecal shedding occurred in 33 (91.7 %) experimentally challenged calves and in none of the control calves. There was a difference in the log-total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight among the four exposure groups; calves with the lowest magnitude of exposure (1\u00d710 3 oocysts) shed less than the other three groups. At higher magnitudes of exposure, there was more variability in the range of fecal oocyst shedding. There was an inverse relationship between the log-total amount of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight and the number of days to the onset of fecal shedding per calf, i.e., the more time that elapsed to the onset of fecal shedding, the fewer oocysts that were shed. The pattern of fecal shedding over time for all calves shedding oocysts was curvilinear; the number of oocysts increased with time, reached a peak, and declined. Therefore, the dynamics of oocyst shedding can be influenced in part by limiting exposure among calves and delaying the onset of fecal oocyst shedding.",

            "text": "The Apicomplexa protozoan parasite genus Cryptosporidium is comprised of over 20 species to date (Fayer 2004) . Transmission of Cryptosporidium is most often by the fecaloral route via contaminated water, food, or fomites or by direct ingestion of infected feces. In cattle, Cryptosporidium bovis, Cryptosporidium andersoni, and Cryptosporidium parvum are species of particular importance. Among these three species, C. bovis and C. andersoni are prevalent in post-weaned and adult cattle, respectively, and are not important zoonoses (Fayer et al. 2007 ). In contrast, C. parvum is an important zoonosis, is the most pathogenic species in cattle, and is prevalent in pre-weaned calves (Fayer et al. 2007; Lindsay et al. 2000; Robinson et al. 2006; Trotz-Williams et al. 2006; Santin et al. 2004) . C. parvum infects many mammals and is globally recognized as a significant cause of diarrhea in people and cattle (Feltus et al. 2006; Xiao and Feng 2008) . Cryptosporidium hominis, which is host adapted to humans, is also an important cause of diarrhea in people and was the cause of the largest water-borne disease outbreak ever recorded, impacting approximately 403,000 citizens of Milwaukee, WI, USA in 1993 (Chappell et al. 2006; MacKenzie et al. 1995; Morgan-Ryan et al. 2002) .",

The severity of this diarrhea and its subsequent dehydration influence morbidity and mortality in people and animals (Anderson 1998; O'Handley et al. 1999) . Treatment of the illness poses a challenge as there is not a consistently effective chemotherapeutic agent for use in animals or in people (Amadi et al. 2002; Anderson and Curran 2007; Graczyk et al. 2011; Harp and Goff 1998; Mead 2002) . For example, nitazoxanide has shown efficacy in immune-competent but not immunecompromised children (Amadi et al. 2002) . In experimentally infected dairy calves, treatment with nitazoxanide reduces the duration of fecal oocyst shedding and improves clinical signs; however, there are no animal-labeled formulations at this time (Ollivett et al. 2009 ). Animal-labeled formulations of halofuginone are available. While halofuginone has been shown to improve clinical signs by delaying the onset of diarrhea and reducing fecal oocyst shedding, it does not prevent diarrhea and fecal shedding entirely (Jarvie et al. 2005) .",

Infection and disease most commonly occur in calves between 1 and 4 weeks of age and usually last for approximately 2 weeks (de Graaf et al. 1999; O'Handley et al. 1999; Xiao and Herd 1994) . In young animals, during the first few days of natural infection, large numbers of oocysts may be shed in the feces. For example, a naturally infected 6-day-old calf that sheds oocysts for 6 days may produce in excess of 3\u00d710 10 oocysts (Nydam et al. 2001) . Excreted oocysts are readily infective and can survive for several weeks to months in the environment and likely cause infection when calves are born into contaminated maternity pens or placed in contaminated housing (Anderson 1998) . Therefore, the extent of calf exposure to infective oocysts may be associated with the degree of environmental contamination. There is currently little published information on this relationship in calves, nor is there literature describing the pattern of fecal oocyst shedding over time as it relates to the magnitude of exposure.",

Forty three calves were purchased at birth from a local dairy farm and enrolled in the study as they were born. Control calves (n=7) were enrolled concurrently with test calves (n= 36). At least one study author attended all calvings. The perineum of the dam was thoroughly cleaned with povidone-iodine scrub, and calves were caught on single-use plastic sheets to prevent on-farm manure contamination.

They were stored at 4\u00b0C in suspension with 100 U of penicillin G sodium per milliliter, 100 mg of streptomycin sulfate per milliliter, and 0.25 mg of amphotericin B per milliliter for up to 2 months or until needed.

Viable oocysts were the sum of 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-negative (DAPI\u2212), propidium iodide-negative (PI\u2212) oocysts, and DAPI-positive (DAPI+) PI-oocysts; DAPI+PI+oocysts were considered inactivated (Jenkins et al. 1999) . Oocysts used for dosing were at least 87 % viable. Doses were calculated based on the percent viable. Each dose was administered in a 5-ml suspension of C. parvum oocysts in reverse osmosis water via the rigid portion of an oroesophageal feeding tube, followed by 120 ml of water to ensure all of the oocyst suspension was delivered to the calf Fecal sample analysis Quantitative analysis of C. parvum oocysts in the fecal samples collected was performed using Merifluor Crypto/Giardia immunofluorescence antibody detection reagent from Meridian Diagnostics (Cincinnati, OH, USA) (Xiao and Herd 1993) . The immunofluorescence procedure was modified from the kit instructions. Briefly, a 0.10-g portion of feces was mixed into 10 ml of PBS (pH=7.4) in a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube. Then, 100 \u03bcl of the mixture was removed, and 5 \u03bcl of Merifluor immunofluorescence antibody reagent was added. The solution was vortexed and incubated in the dark at room temperature for at least 30 min and stored at 4\u00b0C until examination. Following incubation, 10.5 \u03bcl of the sample was placed on a slide and covered with a coverslip. The \u00d720 objective on a fluorescent compound binocular microscope (460-490 wavelength fluorescent compound binocular microscope Olympus BX41, Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA, USA) was used to count the number of oocysts observed. The number of oocysts observed in 10.5 \u03bcl was then multiplied by 10,000 to give the number of oocysts per gram of feces. This count was standardized by the dry weight percentage. Dry weight analysis of fecal samples was obtained by taking a 10to 20-g portion of each original fecal sample, drying it at 108\u00b0C for a minimum of 24 h (Thermolyne Mechanical Oven, Barnstead International, Dubuque, IA, USA), then weighing it directly (Precision Standard Scale, Ohaus Corporation, Pine Brook, NJ, USA) (Bellosa et al. 2011 ).",

In the absence of a commercially available vaccine and consistently effective prophylaxis, the best means by which cryptosporidiosis can be controlled is through preventive measures.

            "text": "We have described the relationship between magnitude of oral exposure to C. parvum, and the onset, duration, and cessation of fecal shedding. We found a difference in the onset and cessation of fecal oocyst shedding, and in the log-total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight across four magnitudes of exposure, but we did not find a difference in the duration of fecal oocyst shedding. In contrast to our study, the study conducted by Moore et al. did find a significant difference in duration of fecal shedding with respect to size of inoculum in dairy calves (Moore et al. 2003) . However, in that study, 75 calves were enrolled, and 29 calves died after day3 of life. Among the eight that were necropsied, Salmonella spp, rotavirus, and coronavirus were recovered in addition to C. parvum. It is, therefore, possible that many of the calves enrolled in that study experienced a longer duration of shedding due to altered immune function associated with co-infection. In our study, all calves survived through to completion of the study. All calves were tested for infection with Salmonella spp, as well as for rotavirus and coronavirus infection, and all were negative, whereby eliminating enteric co-infection as a confounder. In addition to the study by Moore et al., another study conducted by DuPont et al. looking at the infectivity of C. parvum in people suggests that the size of oral inoculum not only influences the duration of fecal shedding but also influences the onset of fecal shedding Table 1 The average (mean\u00b1SD), median, and range for the number of days post-challenge until the onset of fecal shedding, the number of days post-challenge until the cessation of fecal shedding, the number of days duration of fecal shedding post-challenge, and the log-total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight in calves experimentally challenged with 1\u00d710 3 (group A), 1\u00d710 4 (group B), 1\u00d710 5 (group C), or 1\u00d710 6 (group D) oocysts of C. parvum Fig. 2 The total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight (log-transformed) by dose magnitude [1\u00d710 3 (group A), 1\u00d710 4 (group B), 1\u00d710 5 (group C), or 1\u00d710 6 (group D)] among calves that shed oocysts (n=33) following experimental challenge with C. parvum (DuPont et al. 1995) . However, people in this study with base-line antibody to the parasite experienced more severe clinical illness, which the authors attribute to increased susceptibility. This may have potentially confounded the onset and duration of fecal shedding. Both of these studies included oral inoculums that were less 1\u00d710 3 oocysts in magnitude, whereas ours did not. Therefore, it is possible that the onset, cessation, and duration of fecal shedding are more appreciably impacted at lower dose magnitudes. It is also possible that the sample size for our study was not large enough to detect this difference. The median time to onset of fecal shedding in our study was between 7 and 8 days across the four dose groups; the earliest onset was 4 days post-challenge, and the latest onset was 12 days post-challenge as is indicated in our survival analysis (Fig. 1) . A paper by Moore et al. reports an overall mean time to onset of fecal shedding across all dose magnitudes of 7.4 days, which is similar to our reported median time. In our study, however, the mean time to onset of fecal shedding was slightly greater than in Moore's study, with the two lowest dose groups having a mean of 9 days, and the two highest dose groups having a mean of 8 days.",

Efforts were made to minimize extreme variability in parasite level effects by using the same field strain of oocysts that were at least 87 % viable. Likewise, efforts were also made to minimize extreme variability in calf level effects by enrolling calves from the same commercial dairy and ensuring adequate passive transfer of antibodies. These differences are best explained by normal variation in many factors acting in concert with one another including effects attributable to variations in calves, the parasite, and the environment. It should also be noted that among the three calves that did not shed and the two calves that shed earliest and latest in the study, all received a dose of 1\u00d710 3 oocysts, which was the lowest dose magnitude we tested. It is conceivable that this was not a large enough infectious dose for the three calves that never shed, and the one calf that did not start to shed until day12 post-challenge. Given the low infectious dose reported in people, it stands to reason that factors other than magnitude of infectious dose influenced fecal shedding for these calves (DuPont et al. 1995) . These results indicate that the degree of fecal shedding of oocysts is influenced by multiple factors including dose magnitude, parasite lifecycle, parasite level effects, and calf level effects. It is also possible that different results might be attained with the use of a different strain, but without testing, we cannot be sure. Fig. 3 The pattern of fecal oocyst shedding over time for each dose group [1\u00d710 3 (group A), 1\u00d710 4 (group B), 1\u00d710 5 (group C), or 1\u00d710 6 (group D)] among calves that shed oocysts (n=33) following experimental challenge with C. parvum The results of this study show that calves exhibit the same pattern of fecal shedding over time regardless of dose magnitude. Calves that receive a lower oral dose begin shedding later and shed fewer total oocysts. This study also demonstrated that calves shed numbers of oocysts that greatly exceed the magnitude of the dose administered, which is partially attributable to the auto-infective stage of the parasite lifecycle in which sporozoites re-infect the epithelial cells of the intestinal lumen and thus initiate a new cycle of parasite development. While it was not evaluated in this study, it is possible that the autoinfective stage of the parasite life cycle may cause a delay in the onset of fecal shedding at lower infectious doses. Infected calves, in turn, void readily infective resistant oocysts into the surrounding environment. Given the heartiness of the parasite, the potential for large-scale contamination of the local environment and the low infectious dose, disease prevention remains to be the best control measure for cryptosporidiosis.",

Therefore, if onset of fecal oocyst shedding was delayed, environmental parasite loading could be reduced, as well as the risk of exposure for calves and people. Differences in fecal shedding varied across doses and between doses, indicating important effects at both the calf level and parasite level. Preventing calf exposure to the parasite entirely is not realistic in conventional calf-rearing systems where the pathogen is often endemic and therefore not an adequate means of disease prevention alone. Instead, an integrated approach to the prevention of cryptosporidiosis in calves should be undertaken in order to address parasite, calf, and environmental factors through the provision of clean and dry housing and an appropriate plane of nutrition. Future studies will be focused on the impact of delayed fecal shedding and reduced dose magnitudes on fecal oocyst shedding, as well as on delineating the dose-response relationship and determining the ID 50 for fecal shedding in dairy calves.",
