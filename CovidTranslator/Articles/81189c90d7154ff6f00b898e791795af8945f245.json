The VL and VH amplicons were combined using SOE-PCR by a 12 amino acid flexible linker (SSGGGGSGGGGS), which produced the scFv gene (named scFv/6E6). After sequence analysis, the scFv/6E6 gene was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6p-1 with a GST-tag. The recombinant scFv/6E6 protein was successfully expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli by IPTG induction. Moreover, the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein was purified from the inclusion body form by the gel-cutting measure followed by electroelution and dialysis. The recombinant scFv/ 6E6 protein reported here will provide some basis for further antiviral drug research based on the scFv molecule.",

PEDV has a substantial detrimental effect on the swine industry due to its high mortality rates among suckling piglets. (1) (2) (3) Since PED was first reported in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1978, many studies regarding PEDV have been carried out for the prevention of PED. (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) However, in recent years PEDV infections still exist and cause frequent occurrences of piglet diarrhea in many swine-raising provinces in China, leading to severe economic losses. (11) (12) (13) PEDV is a member of group 1a, genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. The size of its genome is approximately 28 kb, encoding three major structural proteins-spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N). Of these, the S protein plays an important role in induction of neutralizing antibodies, receptor binding, and cell membrane fusion. (14, 15) These properties make the S protein a suitable target for the development of antiviral agents.",

(7) Further research revealed that the MAb 6E6 was capable of recognizing the native S protein of PEDV with a high affinity. The single-chain fragment variable (scFv) is a small, engineered antibody in which the variable light chain (VL) and heavy chain (VH) of the antibody are connected by a short polypeptide linker. At present, the scFv molecule is considered a powerful tool for therapeutic antigen targeting in vivo. (16, 17) In the current study, the scFv gene was obtained from the hybridoma cell 6E6 secreting the monoclonal antibody against S protein of PEDV. After cloning, the framework regions and complementarity determining regions of the scFv gene were analyzed on the basis of the deduced amino acid sequences. The recombinant scFv protein was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli using the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6p-1 with a GST-tag. Moreover, the high-purity recombinant scFv protein was produced through a simple gelcutting procedure followed by electroelution and dialysis. Our aim is to reveal the basic sequence information of the MAb 6E6 and develop a practical procedure for the preparation of scFv to facilitate further antiviral research.",

(19, 20) During the past decade, advances in recombinant antibody technology have led to the development of a large variety of engineered antibody molecules for research, diagnosis, and therapy with specificities out of reach of conventional antibody technology. Of these, scFv is the smallest unit of immunoglobulin molecule functioning in antigen-binding activities. In comparison to the parental antibody, scFv molecules have several advantages in clinical practices, including better penetration, lower immunogenicity, and therapeutic antigen targeting in vivo, as well as the ability to facilitate mass production in vitro. At present, numerous scFvs have been constructed against hapten, protein, carbohydrate, receptor, tumor antigen, and viruses. All these scFvs demonstrate good potential for use in several fields, including medical therapies and diagnostic applications. (21) (22) (23) (24) In our study, the scFv gene of the MAb 6E6 against PEDV S protein was cloned from its hybridoma cells. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the VH and VL genes of the scFv/6E6 gene were composed of four framework regions (FRs) and three complementarity determining regions (CDRs); they showed high identity with the VH and VL (kappa) genes of mouse immunoglobulin published in GenBank. Many studies have proven that the scFv genes from different antibodies were successfully expressed in prokaryotic expression system ",

However, we did not obtain a positive expression of the scFv gene. Moreover, the vector pGEX-6p-1 was used in an attempt to generate the recombinant protein of the scFv/6E6 gene. The results demonstrated that the scFv/6E6 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli through the fusion effect of the GST-tag. It had been proved that the vector pGEX-6p-1 showed significant efficacy in the expression of leukotoxin of Fusobacterium necrophorum. (26) The prokaryotic expression system has several advantages, including easy culture, rapid cell growth, low cost, high yield, and relatively short expression time. However, if the expressed protein is required for functional studies, the prokaryotic system shows a problem as most proteins become insoluble in inclusion bodies, which are very difficult to recover as functional proteins. Thus, purification of the inclusion bodies protein is a key step for prokaryotic expression system. Gel-cutting purification of the inclusion body protein has been proven to be a simple, time-saving, and much less expensive means in several studies. (9, 10) Additionally, gelcutting purification is capable of facilitating the preparation of high-purity recombinant proteins in vitro. However, it is difficult to remove the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) completely from the cutting-gel purified proteins through the conventional protein dialysis. In our study, the D-Tube Dialyzer was used for electroelution and dialysis of the recombinant scFv/ 6E6 protein from polyacrylamide gels. The procedure efficiently recovers proteins and simultaneously removes ampholytes from proteins. The purified proteins are compatible with most downstream applications such as animal immunization for antibody production and functional assays. In addition, the RAPIDstain reagent, instead of potassium chloride staining, improved the sensitivity of the gel staining and simplified the experimental operation of the cutting-gel purification. In Western blot analysis, the recombinant scFv/ 6E6 protein was conformed using the monoclonal antibody against GST-tag, and the specific reaction band was found in *50 kDa. This result provided further evidence that the scFv protein (*25 kDa) was correctly fused to the GST-tag (*26 kDa) of the vector pGEX-6p-1.",
