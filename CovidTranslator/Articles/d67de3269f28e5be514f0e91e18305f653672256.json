            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing practices in cases of occupational exposure can be a highly charged and controversial issue. While the advent of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP, preventive medication taken soon after a needlestick or other exposure to patients' blood) has substantially reduced the risk of acquiring HIV, using PEP comes with its own risks. According to published guidelines, PEP should be taken only when source patients are HIV-positive or have risk factors for HIV. 1 Initiating PEP when source patients are uninfected puts exposed persons at risk from taking toxic drugs with no compensating benefit. Forgoing PEP if the source is infected carries a greater risk of acquiring HIV. On one side of a debate are those who would argue that in all cases, HIV testing should be performed only after the source patient is given pre-test information and provides his or her voluntary informed consent. Others would argue that, when an exposed health care provider is put at risk either of acquiring HIV or needlessly suffering toxic effects from PEP, an exception from normal informed consent practice should be permitted. Still others would argue that unconsented HIV testing in cases of occupational exposure can be justified on the balance of harms and benefits to both source and exposed persons. How can emergency physicians decide which of these HIV testing practices is most appropriate? One place to turn is laws or policies governing HIV testing in cases of occupational exposure; however, these typically come with little or no explanation or justification. Whenever laws or policies depart from the well-established ethical imperative to respect patients' rights to informed consent, it is critical to subject such departures to rigorous ethical analysis. In this article, we summarize public health policy and state laws regarding unconsented HIV testing in cases of occupational exposure, and analyze the situation using two leading ethical theories.",

The controversy over HIV testing in cases of occupational exposure is reflected in inconsistencies and variations in state laws and policies. Thirty-six states have laws that allow unconsented HIV testing of source patients in select cases of occupational exposure when such exposures occurs to health care providers rendering care in the hospital setting (Table 1 ). 2 Each state has its own requirements for unconsented HIV testing, resulting in substantial differences among laws in different states. Variations exist in numerous procedural elements, including who can authorize an unconsented test, how the test is documented in the medical record, and who is informed of the test results.",

            "text": "Some states, like Arizona, Maine, New Mexico, and Oregon, require a court order for all instances of unconsented testing, while most other states require a court order only if a blood specimen is not already available for testing (Table 1) . There is also variation on whom unconsented HIV testing may be performed. [3] [4] [5] [6] Hawaii, Maryland, and New York permit unconsented HIV testing in cases of occupational exposure only if source patients are unable to consent for testing because they are absent, deceased, comatose, or lack capacity to consent. [7] [8] [9] Other states, such as California, South Carolina, and Rhode Island permit unconsented HIV testing on patients with full capacity even when they refuse voluntarily testing. [10] [11] [12] A list of state statutes governing HIV testing in cases of occupational exposure can be found in Data Supplement S1. Similar disparities regarding unconsented HIV testing in cases of occupational exposure are found in policy statements. In their 2001 guidelines for managing occupational exposure, the CDC states that when the HIV status of the source patient is unknown, informed consent for HIV testing should be obtained in accordance with applicable state and local law. 13 The CDC's 2005 guidelines do not mention unconsented testing even though the refusal of source patients to consent to testing is cited as a challenge in post-exposure management. 1 While strongly opposed to unconsented HIV testing in routine practice, the American College of Emergency Physicians in its policy statement on bloodborne infections \"strongly supports the rapid HIV testing of patients who are the source of a health care workers occupational blood/body fluid exposure.\" 14, 15 The statement says nothing about obtaining informed consent for HIV testing in such cases. Going one step further, the American Medical Association specifically calls for adoption of legislation that permits HIV testing without explicit consent \"where a health care worker has been placed at risk by exposure to potentially infected body fluids.\" 16 The variability in state law and policy demonstrates a clear lack of consensus on how best to approach HIV testing of source patients in cases of occupational exposure. Existing laws and policies provide no rationale for recommending one HIV testing practice over another. When laws are inconsistent or lack a compelling justification, they cannot provide proper guidance. We therefore turn to two leading ethical approaches to analyze the situation.",

More severe occupational exposures, such as those caused by large hollow-bore needles, deep punctures, or contact with visible blood on devices or needles used in an artery or vein, carry the greatest risk of HIV transmission. 1 When more severe exposures occur, the risk of HIV transmission is approximately 0.3%. 25 PEP taken soon after a needlestick or other exposure to patients' blood has been shown to reduce the likelihood of HIV transmission by as much as 81%. 25 Unfortunately, PEP causes unpleasant side effects, and less frequently, significant harm from drug toxicities. 26 Two or three antiretroviral agents must be taken once or twice daily for 28 days. 1 Nearly 50% of health care personnel taking PEP reported adverse events, and about one third prematurely stopped taking their medications. 26 While side effects from PEP are generally unpleasant: nausea, fatigue, headache, vomiting, and diarrhea can be severe. Most of the antiretroviral drugs recommended for PEP have potential serious or life-threatening drug interactions. 27 There is limited information about the effects of most antiretroviral drugs on the developing fetus or neonate. 13 There have even been reports of fatal lactic acidosis in pregnant women treated with a combination of stavudine and didanosine. 13 Due to its potential for harm, PEP should be taken only when the source of the exposure is HIV-positive or has risk factors for HIV. 1 However, risk factors alone are a poor predictor of HIV infection, with as many as 26% of newly diagnosed HIV patients reporting no risk factors. 28 When source patients actively refuse HIV testing, exposed persons are incapable of making fully informed decisions about whether to initiate PEP.",

(Table 3) -If a source patient is HIVinfected but refuses testing, the exposed person suffers anxiety from not knowing the source patients' HIV status, with the additional discomfort of having to make a decision about initiating PEP under risk and uncertainty. 32 To forgo PEP if the source is HIV-infected increases the likelihood of transmission.

As already noted, most exposed persons will suffer side-effects from PEP with no opportunity for compensating benefit when the source is uninfected. If an unconsented HIV test is performed on the uninfected source patient, two possible benefits exist. One is relief from knowing the source patient's negative serostatus. The second is the opportunity to knowingly forgo PEP and its related side effects and toxicities. (Table 4) -If an unconsented test is performed on an HIV-infected source patient, psychological, social, and physical harms may occur. Patients who test positive for HIV after providing voluntary informed consent have higher rates of depression than the general population. 33 These psychological effects may be magnified in persons tested for HIV without their voluntary consent, since they may be less emotionally prepared for their test results, as well as angered by the failure to respect their autonomous refusal. If an unintended breach of confidentiality occurs, HIV-positive source patients could be subject to social harms from stigma and discrimination. 34 Last, when patients test positive for HIV, physicians are required to report their names to public health authorities, who may then use partner notification practices to contact exposed persons for testing. 35 Even when the name of the source is not revealed, in many stable relationships the source person's identity will be obvious. Although these notification practices are legally allowed or mandated, they may still have harmful consequences, the most concerning of which is the potential for violence against the infected partner, which has happened to women. 36 If an unconsented HIV test is performed on an HIV-infected source patient, there can be substantial individual and public health benefits. Earlier diagnoses can lead to earlier initiation of treatment, improved health outcomes, and reduced mortality from HIV/AIDS. 37 Knowing one's HIV status also enables infected persons to take precautions that prevent spreading the infection to intimate partners, such as using condoms or accessing early antiretroviral treatment, which greatly reduces likelihood of transmission. 38 If an unconsented HIV test is performed on an HIV-uninfected source patient, psychological harms can occur. Source patients will likely be angered by having HIV tests performed against their wishes, a clear violation of their autonomy. Overriding a source patient's refusal could also erode trust in the physician and the health care system at large. There is even the possibility, albeit remote, that some individuals would choose to forgo needed medical care in fear of being tested for HIV without their consent.",

The types and severity of physical harm to the exposed person from taking PEP unnecessarily if the source is HIV uninfected, or forgoing PEP if the source is HIV infected, are known.

Benefits to source patients who discover they are uninfected are fewer, but exist nonetheless.

The analysis depends on the strength of the duty to respect autonomy by obtaining informed consent to perform an HIV test, compared with the duty to prevent harm to the exposed health care provider. It is difficult to resolve these cases because there is little objective basis for determining when one prima facie duty is more important than a conflicting prima facie duty. 19 Nevertheless, philosophical ethics recognizes the existence of a hierarchy of duties, with some more compelling than others when they conflict. The duty to save a life is stronger than other duties a physician may have. If a physician is scheduled to perform a routine procedure on a patient but encounters another patient in need of resuscitation, it is obvious which duty takes precedence. Although the duty to respect patient autonomy is central in the practice of medicine, it is not absolute. The duty of physicians to prevent harm is embodied in one of the ancient mottos in the profession; in the case under discussion here, we contend that it supersedes the duty to obtain consent for an HIV test.",
