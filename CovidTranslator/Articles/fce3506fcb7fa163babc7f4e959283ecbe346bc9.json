Ninety-seven percent (181/186) of the cases had exposure to the health care facilities. We are reporting a superspreading event that transmitted MERS-CoV to 81 persons at a hospital emergency room (ER) during the Korean outbreak in 2015. The index case was a 35-yr-old man who had vigorous coughing while staying at the ER for 58 hr. As in severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks, superspreading events can cause a large outbreak of MERS in healthcare facilities with severe consequences. All healthcare facilities should establish and implement infection prevention and control measure as well as triage policies and procedures for early detection and isolation of suspected MERS-CoV cases.",

On May 30, real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay on a sputum specimen obtained on May 29 was returned as positive for MERS-CoV. As a result, he was transferred on the same day to an isolation unit of a fourth hospital, a MERS treatment hospital designated by the government. Fig. 2A shows the clinical course of the patient. After the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was made, pegylated interferon alpha-2a was given by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 180 \u00b5g per week for 2 weeks and oral ribavirin (1,200 mg loading dose, followed by 400 mg every 8 hr for 4 days then 200 mg every 6 hr for 6 days) was given. He received methylprednisolone 60 mg intravenously daily over 11 days for treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The laboratory tests showed mild changes including leukopenia, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, and liver enzyme elevation (Table 1) . His condition improved continuously and mechanical ventilation was discontinued on June 6. On June 21, he was removed from the isolation room after the two consecutive sputum specimens collected at 48 hr interval tested negative for MERS-CoV on RT-PCR assay. He was discharged the following day.",

In the 2014 MERS-CoV outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 88% of the 112 symptomatic patients with MERS-CoV infection had exposure to a health care facility (8) . Neither of these papers reported any superspreading events, in contrast to the many severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) superspreading events in hospitals in 2003 (9) . Thus, this is the first report of superspreading event of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. A superspreading event is likely to be related to the triad of the agent, host, and environment. The preliminary analysis of virus sequencing data did not found any mutations linked to transmissibility or pathogenesis (10, 11) . However, recent complete genome analysis of the virus showed genetic recombination events between group 3 and group 5 of clade B that may have implications for the transmissibility (12) . Although the patient did not undergo any aerosol-generating procedures, he had vigorous and frequent coughing that could be related to high viral shedding or increased efficiency of transmission.",

Our report highlights that all persons staying in the same ER or perhaps using the same toilet, should be considered and evaluated as having been potentially exposed to MERS-CoV.

The basic reproduction number R0 for MERS-CoV has been estimated to be less than 1, suggesting that the virus has not yet reached epidemic potential (16) .

Until now the lack of reported superspreading events due to MERS-CoV was a reassuring difference between MERS and SARS. This report clearly demonstrates that, as in SARS outbreak, superspreading events can cause a large outbreak of MERS in health care facilities. To prevent future international hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV, all health care facilities should establish and implement infection prevention and control measures as well as triage policies and procedures for early detection and isolation of suspected MERS-CoV cases.",
