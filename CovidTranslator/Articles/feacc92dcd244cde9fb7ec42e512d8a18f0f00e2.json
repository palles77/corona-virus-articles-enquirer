The promising trend towards a reduced mortality associated with increasing experience in using the technique, as described by the authors, is indisputable and supports a recent publication from the United Kingdom's ECMOcenters (2) . Nevertheless this confirms primarily the positive correlation between dedicated center-based experience in treating severe ARDS and outcome, also mentioned in different expert discussions.",

The authors reported that from January 2006 to July 2012, a total of 266 patients were treated by using veno venous ECMO at Regensburg University Medical Center. It would have been interesting to know which proportion of these patients were cannulated in an external hospital and subsequently transported between hospitals (>100, as mentioned by the authors). It would also be interesting to know the type and frequency of transport-related complications since almost no valid data have been published in this context yet. A fundamental rule is that for ECMO implantation in a decentralized hospital and for the subsequent interhospital transport, a high-quality logistic concept using a small team with excellent technical expertise is crucial, as is regular training (2) . This is the only way in which patients can transported successfully and at a high-quality level.",

Using extracorporeal pulmonary support is one of several therapeutic options in the context of the treatment and should, in our opinion, also be restricted to centers. In our article for Deutsches \u00c4rzteblatt we tried to make that very point.Potentially life-threatening complications need to be detected and managed as early as possible; this is possible only if staff are experienced and intensively trained, and if colleagues from other medical specialties are accessible, for example, vascular surgeons.The main prerequisite for treating such patients in centers is a mobile ECMO team that can externally initiate extracorporeal support if required, in order to",
