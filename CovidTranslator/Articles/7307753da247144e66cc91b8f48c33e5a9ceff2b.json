In this study, specific pathogen-free chicks were vaccinated with the commercial live vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A. Blood samples were collected at weekly intervals for the detection of IBV-specific antibodies and quantification of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes. At 21 days post-inoculation the vaccinated birds were challenged with the IBV prevalent local strains GX-YL5, GX-GL11079 and GX-NN09032, respectively. Trachea and kidney samples were collected at 5 days post-challenge for the detection of the virus. The results showed that the H120 group exhibited medium antibody levels, the lowest percentages of CD4 + , CD8 + T lymphocytes and the highest viral loads. The 4/91 group showed the lowest antibody levels, but the highest percentages of CD4 + , CD8 + T lymphocytes and the lowest viral loads. The LDT3-A group showed the highest antibody levels, the medium percentages of CD4 + , CD8 + T lymphocytes and the medium viral loads. The protection rates of H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A groups were 41.7-58.3%, 75.0-83.7% and 66.7-75.0%, respectively. The present study demonstrated that the vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A could stimulate the immunized chicks to produce different levels of humoral and cellular immunity to resist the infection of IBV, but couldn't provide complete protection against the prevalent local strains of IBV in southern China. Also, the vaccine 4/91 offered the best immune protection among the three vaccines.",

An increasing number of new serotypes or variants of IBV, which were caused by gene mutation and recombination, have been identified [4, 9, 16, 17, 19] . Vaccination is the main measure for the prevention and control of IB, but since there are multiple IBV serotypes and different serotypes of IBVs, vaccinations result in incomplete or no cross-protection against the various types of IBV. Hence, it is important to choose suitable vaccines for the control of IBV in the field.",

Although the live, attenuated vaccines can cause virus mutation and recombination, they can induce effective humoral and cellular immune responses as well as local immunity [3, 21] . In young birds, live, attenuated vaccines are especially used to achieve early protection and also to prime future layers and breeders, which will be boosted with the inactivated vaccines later [21] .

In addition, IBV strains prevalent in a specific geographic region are distinct and unique, although some have a more general distribution [1, 2] .

In all vaccinated groups, the viral loads in the trachea were higher than those in the kidney. The viral loads in the trachea and kidney of the vaccinated groups at every time points showed the same pattern, that was the H120 group was higher than that of the LDT3-A group and the LDT3-A group was higher than that of the 4/91 group. The viral loads in trachea and kidney of the 4/91 group challenged with the same serotype strain GX-NN09032 maintained a low level of less than 10 2 copies/\u00b5l and were significantly lower than those of the H120 group and the LDT3-A group at 5 dpc. None of the viruses was detected in the trachea or kidney samples from the blank control group.",

Therefore, it is extremely critical to choose the appropriate IBV vaccines in practice. Little is known about the protection conferred by the commonly used live attenuated vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A against IBV prevalent local strains in southern China. In the present study, significantly higher antibody levels and percentages of CD4 + , CD8 + T lymphocytes in vaccinated groups compared to the non-vaccinated groups within 21 dpi indicated that the vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A could stimulate the immunized chickens to produce humoral and cellular immunity that potentially resist or eliminate the infection of IBV. However, at 5 dpc, the protection rates of H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A vaccines against the challenges of the three prevalent IBV isolates were 41.7-58.3%, 75-83.7% and 66.7-75.0%, respectively. Hence, none of the three attenuated vaccines could provide complete protection against all the current prevalent isolates, but vaccine 4/91 offered the best immune protection of the three and vaccine LDT3-A had better protection than the H120 vaccine.",

In this study, the attenuated vaccine H120 (serotype 3) provided poor protection against IBV GX-YL5 (serotype 1), GX-GL11079 (serotype 2) and GX-NN09032 (serotype 5) strains with the low protection rate of 41.7, 58.3 and 58.3%, respectively. The vaccine 4/91 (serotype 5) has provided lower protection rate against the challenge with GX-GL11079 (serotype 2, 75.0%) compared to GX-NN09032 (serotype 5, 83.7%). Interestingly, the vaccine 4/91 (serotype 5) provided the same protection rate (83.7%) against the challenge with isolate GX-YL5 (serotype 1) and GX-NN09032 (serotype 5), but the viral loads of trachea and kidney from GX-NN09032 challenged birds were always lower than those from GX-YL5 challenged birds. Therefore, our data indicated that the vaccine 4/91 had a greater ability to inhibit the replication and reduce the shedding of a homologous serotype virus than a heterologous serotype virus; the vaccine H120 provided poor protection against the heterologous serotype viruses. These findings support the necessity of developing new vaccines whose antigenicity match the antigenic profile of current prevalent IBV variants in the region.",

Previous studies demonstrated that the H120 vaccine couldn't provide sufficient protection against the field isolates in China [6, [13] [14] [15] 24] . The latest report showed that a novel recombinant virulent IBV strain was isolated from an H120-and 4/91-IBV-vaccinated flock in China [27] . In our study, the attenuated vaccine 4/91 could not provide complete protection against IBV GX-NN09032 strain even though they shared the same serotype [20] . The reason for this may be that a single vaccine dose of a monovalent vaccine could not provide sufficient immunity with complete protection to birds. Therefore, in an attempt to provide broader protection to chickens, the prime-boost vaccination program in combination with application of two different IBV vaccines (\"live + live\" or \"live + inactivated\") should be performed for the birds in southern China. In other countries, it has also been showed that vaccination with two antigenically distinct live-attenuated vaccines can achieved a broad cross-protection against multiple different IBV types [5, 21, 22] . Further investigation will be necessary to determine which combination of H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A vaccines could provide the most effective protection against the prevalent local strains in southern China.",
