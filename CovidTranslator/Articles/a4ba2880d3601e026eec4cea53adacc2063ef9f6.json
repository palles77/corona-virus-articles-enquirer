In this study we show that live vaccines efficacy can be improved by formulation with adjuvants in a model of mucosal delivery of live infectious bronchitis vaccine in chicken. Three adjuvant technologies have been tested using intranasal and spray delivery methods to poultry. Those technologies are water in oil in water emulsion, nanoparticles and polymer adjuvants. Intranasal delivery of polymer and nanoparticles adjuvanted live vaccines improved significantly the antibody titer and protection to challenge observed compared to a commercial non-adjuvanted reference. Moreover, spray delivery of the polymer adjuvanted vaccine showed a significantly higher protection compared to the non-adjuvanted reference. Our data demonstrates that the use of Montanide TM adjuvants in the formulation of live poultry vaccines for mucosal delivery can confer to vaccinated animals a significantly improved protection against pathogens.",

            "text": "Live vaccines are widely employed in veterinary practice. Generally used to vaccinate young animals [1] , these types of vaccines are dedicated to a large spectrum of species with applications from farm animals such as pigs [2] or poultry [3] to companion animals such as horses [4] or pets [5] . Based on the infectious properties of the attenuated or genetically modified live micro-organism, these types of vaccines exist for bacterial [6] , viral [7] and parasitic [8] pathogen models. The live pathogens delivered by vaccine inoculums are thought to initiate both humoral and cellular protective response after one delivery. Under experimental conditions, 100% efficacy has been demonstrated for live vaccine application. However, in field practice up to 10% of vaccinated animals present a lack of protection after live vaccine delivery [1] . This population represents a reservoir for pathogens and creates potential for new pathogenic strains to appear and challenge the vaccine strain in terms of herd protection. Live vaccines can also have an impact on the economical performance of herds as they will induce a transient infection necessary to trigger the immune response, and as reversions to virulence have already been observed in the field. Finally, whereas the cost of bacterial or viral vaccine production can be very low, the vaccine strains of parasitic pathogens can be very expensive to maintain and produce. Improvement of the safety and efficacy of live vaccines is therefore an important issue.",

The most important would be a reduction of the antigenic dose delivered, which would lead to safety improvements, cost limitations and a better control of risks linked to the vaccination procedure. Adjuvant benefits in relation to this type of vaccine technology have already been demonstrated with model adjuvant molecules [9] . However, laboratory studies adjuvants are hardly compatible with industrial-scale production. On the contrary, the Montanide\u2122 range of adjuvants is a well established brand of vaccine adjuvants [10] which is already used in all farm animal models at industrial scale in combination with diverse types of antigens.

Both Montanide\u2122 Gel 01 ST and Montanide\u2122 IMS 1313 N VG adjuvants conferred a significantly enhanced protection to challenge compared to the non-adjuvanted commercial reference, in SPF and farm chickens.

Mineral oil based adjuvants are a reference for commercial injectable poultry vaccines, and we thought that the use of an oil emulsion vaccine with an aqueous continuous phase such as ISA 201 VG could be a good vector for mucosal delivery and enhance the efficacy of mucosal vaccines.

Spray parameters such as particle size can have an impact on spray vaccination and may explain the poor performance of IMS 1313 N in spray delivery. These parameters were not controlled here and should be optimized in further studies. Particle sizing was previously shown to be important in the antigen/immune system contact and to have and impact on the immune response [18, 19] . Further studies should also assess if the protective stimulation using spray vaccination that we observed using polymer adjuvanted vaccine was restricted to the nasal mucosa or was also linked to the oral and on eye surfaces which would lead to different immune system / antigen contact [20] . Other criteria still remain to be studied, such as the ability to manage the antigen load or to combine several antigens in the same spray vaccine.",

The use of adjuvants in live vaccine could improve the efficacy and lead to a better management of the antigen load per vaccine dose. Such efficacy improvement could also improve the safety of the vaccine as the possible adverse reactions observed after delivery of live infectious vaccines could be lowered. Moreover, the risk of reversion to virulence that has already been observed in avian species would also be reduced [21, 22] . Moreover, the use of adjuvants should reduce the number of low or not responding animals and therefore reduce the possible reservoir for the disease [1] . Adjuvanted vaccine performance could also compensate the decrease of antigenic load in case of impaired vaccine delivery or formulation, a possible viricidal effect of storage or inappropriate resuspending conditions. Finally, it would be interesting to study whether adjuvants such as polymer formulae can also improve the survival and transmission of live vaccines.",
