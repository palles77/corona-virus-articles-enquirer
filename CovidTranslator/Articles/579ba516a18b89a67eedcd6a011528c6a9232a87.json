This review summarizes the latest advances and the main technical issues that determine the success of this technology. The pathway from editing to printing, from engineering the genome to achieving the desired animals, does not always imply an easy, fast and safe journey. When applied in large animals, CRISPR involves time-and cost-consuming projects, and it is mandatory not only to choose the best approach for genome editing, but also for embryo production, zygote microinjection or electroporation, cryopreservation and embryo transfer. The main technical refinements and most frequent questions to improve this disruptive biotechnology in large animals are presented. In addition, we discuss some CRISPR applications to enhance livestock production in the context of a growing global demand of food, in terms of increasing efficiency, reducing the impact of farming on the environment, enhancing pest control, animal welfare and health. The challenge is no longer technical. Controversies and consensus, opportunities and threats, benefits and risks, ethics and science should be reconsidered to enter into the CRISPR era.",

On the other hand, the HDR pathway employs a homologous repair template to fix the DSB. This mechanism allows the creation of specific changes in the DNA, which is mediated by the addition of the adequate repair template containing the desired insertion or modification. Genome editing conducted by this mechanism can be used to insert a predefined single nucleotide or sequence, or even change or delete it in existing genes.

Different approaches for CRISPR-Cas system, consisting of a single guide RNA (sgRNA) designed to direct Cas9 to the desired DNA site and induce double strand breaks (DSB). DNA cleavage results in different gene repair mechanisms as nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologydirected repair (HDR, i.e., in the presence of a DNA donor template). Zygotes are obtained by in vitro embryo production (in vitro maturation and fertilization), or derived from in vivo production (insemination and oviduct flushing). Delivery of CRISPR-Cas components into the zygote is performed by direct microinjection into the cytoplasm, or alternatively, by electroporation with no need for embryo micromanipulation. Embryo transfer is carried out either with fresh or cryopreserved embryos by vitrification with minimum volume method (e.g., Cryotop). The wide range of CRISPR applications in large animals include improving productive traits, enhancing animal welfare through adaptation and resilience, conferring resistance to infectious and transmissible diseases, generating animal models for biomedical research, and suppressing other species considered as pests for livestock. catalytically impaired Cas9 endonuclease fused to a reverse transcriptase allows performing precise targeted insertions, deletions and point mutations without requiring DSBs or donor DNA templates.

Although some reports suggest that asymmetric arms improve efficiency, there is no consensus in the convenience of this strategy in the template design [24, 25] . Larger insertions require dsDNA templates with homology arms of 1e3 kb at either side of DSB sites or long ssDNAs. The insertion efficiency of plasmid-mediated HDR with dsDNA is much lower than with ssDNA [26] . Nucleases may re-cut the target locus after the knock-in sequence is inserted. To avoid recurrent DSBs, a silent mutation should be inserted at the PAM site or the target site. If an incompatible PAM or target site sequence is introduced into the genome via the knock-in, the sgRNA-Cas9 complex can no longer bind to the target site, and no further edits can be made. The use of ssODN to induce knock-in or to improve knockout efficiency has been reported recently in ruminant species (sheep: [15, 16] ; goats: [17] ; cows [27] ).",

Novel molecular strategies are available for the generation of genome engineered animals, but mainly in livestock, the success always requires mastering several reproductive technologies. In vitro embryo production (IVEP) is the preferable method of choice to obtain enough quantity of excellent quality zygotes available to be microinjected with the CRISPR components ( Fig. 1 ). Oocytes are collected after follicular aspiration from live females, or moreover from ovaries of a nearby slaughterhouse. Of notice, although zygotes may be collected from the oviduct, in vivo zygote production involves several issues [28] that were overcome with the development of IVEP technology. The success of in vitro production implies that the IVEP laboratory should be capable to obtain good fertilization and cleavage rates (~80e90%) and should have optimum culture conditions to achieve acceptable in vitro development rates (~30e40% blastocysts). For further revision of the procedure for IVEP conducted in our laboratory, see previous review [29] .",

The possibility of cytoplasmic injection (instead of pronuclear injection), represents another great advantage of CRISPR technology, avoiding the centrifugation of zygotes required in farm animals for pronuclear injection. Thus, this technical advantage allows an easier, faster, more efficient and more innocuous microinjection in terms of embryo survival. For this reason, CRISPR microinjection into the cytoplasm of zygotes appears as the preferable method in mammals [28] . On the other hand, as an alternative to direct microinjection into the zygotes, CRISPR cell transfection for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is also used in livestock species. The generation of a live edited animal resulting from SCNT embryos is not an easy task, adding complexity to the whole procedure of genome editing. Although CRISPR success in donor cells is acceptable, SCNT procedure has low efficiency and a low proportion of transferred embryos results in live offspring. Embryos produced by cloning have low development rates, are susceptible to developmental and epigenetic reprogramming anomalies, thus inducing pregnancy failure, stillborn or low newborn survival rates. When SCNT is mastered by the laboratory, the low efficient rate will be compensated with most of the healthy born animals carrying the desired mutation. Genome editing mediated by SCNT is applied by some laboratories in some kind of projects (e.g., multiplex editing), but the high efficiency of CRISPR after direct microinjection into zygotes has allowed an easier approach (sheep: [6, 7, 15, 16] ; goats: [9, 17] ; pigs: [11, 13] ). All together, these reports showed that with CRISPR it is possible to perform direct microinjection into the zygote of different species, with minimum effects on developmental competence and pregnancy rates, high newborn survival rate, and high editing rate with acceptable homozygous proportion.",

This procedure avoids the technically demanding microinjection technique allowing a high throughput scheme in the laboratory. Microinjection requires investment in expensive equipment for embryo micromanipulation, long-term expertise and technical skills. Electroporation also requires equipment, but not as expensive as the microscope and micromanipulators, and it may be already available at the bench for other purposes. The procedure is much easier, the learning curve for the technicians is much faster, and many zygotes may be electroporated in few minutes. Although this method has clear advantages compared with microinjection, little information is reported in livestock to date [33e36]. Proper adaptation from mice and rats protocols to large animals' species would allow the replacement of microinjection by electroporation, as is happening in mice.",

As NHEJ generates random and heterogeneous indels in the animals, the sgRNA can be designed in such a way that the cut intervenes in a restriction site to facilitate subsequent genotyping, however, this approach limits the number of available loci. In addition, there are some methods that are based on the detection of heteroduplex formed when a wild type and a mutant PCR amplicon (or amplicons that carry two different mutations) bind together. These techniques allow genotyping mutations in any locus. Methods based on nucleases include Surveyor nuclease and T7 Endonuclease I assay (T7EI assay). Both nucleases target and digest mismatched heteroduplex double-stranded DNA, and as a result produces two or more smaller fragments in an enzymatic reaction. The digested DNA fragments can thus be resolved and visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis.

In that project Superfine Merino breed was used as genetic background to introduce a MSTN mutation that improves meat production. Superfine Merino is recognized as the best breed to produce the finest and highest quality wool, but the problem for farmers is the lower growing rate and smaller size of the lambs in comparison with other breeds. On the other hand, several breeds have been improved through the years by classic genetics (i.e., selective breeding) to produce meat, which was in detriment of wool quality. A good example is Texel, the most popular breed in the Netherlands and distributed worldwide. The impressive growth rate and meat production of this breed is associated with a spontaneous mutation at the MSTN gene encoding for myostatin (or GDF8) that is involved in muscle cell grow and differentiation. By suppressing the function of MSTN, the muscle mass increases. In our study, Merino embryos were edited with CRISPR to disrupt the MSTN gene. As a result, double muscle lambs were obtained, thus achieving greater growing rate and heavier body weight than Superfine Merino lamb counterparts. The knockout lambs were 25% heavier [7] and maintained the same wool quality traits than Merino lambs (unpublished data). Although this proof of concept did not include the study of the offspring, in following studies germline transmission of MSTN mutation have been reported by its presence in the gonads of founders (in sheep [46] and goats [47] ) and offspring [47] . Amazingly, these early studies suggested that what farmers have pursued for centuries (i.e., animals producing both high-quality wool and more meat), might be achieved by CRISPR in few months.",

In pigs also, after the first report conducted to disrupt MSTN using CRISPR in this species [48] , several studies have been conducted to improve carcass traits through this strategy. In addition, novel ideas have been proposed to use CRISPR for altering male:female ratio in livestock, particularly when the desired product is provided by only one sex (e.g., meat from males or milk from females). Only male offspring strategy has been proposed in beef cattle [49] , since males grow faster and are bigger than females, and only male production may improve efficiency and avoid female culling by farmers. Another approach has been proposed in pigs, in this case to suppress testis development in the fetal gonadal ridges resulting in a female phenotype and avoiding the undesirable male-specific boar taint [50] . Both strategies still needs to be proven and require further investigation. These and other improvements have been proposed in different species and serve as examples of the opportunities of CRISPR to enhance livestock efficiency. Disruption of single genes that have significant effects on traits of economic relevance appears as an interesting approach to improve farm animal genetics.",

Vaccines have not been able to control the disease, there is no effective treatment, and due to the high level of infection and expansion, the only effective method to eradicate the virus during a PRRSV outbreak is depopulation of the herd, sterilization, and repopulation. The macrophage surface protein CD163, which belongs to the scavenger receptor cysteine rich family, mediates the entry of PRRSV into the host cell. Based on this information, genome-edited pigs with a disruption in the CD163 gene were produced by CRISPR, conferring resistance to PRRSV infection. CD163 edited piglets, reported in two different projects in US and Scotland, were completely resistant to North American and European PRRSV strains [52, 53] .

Many routine procedures used to mitigate some of the consequences of intensive livestock, such as calf dehorning, male castration, tail-docking in dairy cattle, mulesing and taildocking in sheep, abortion or offspring culling of not desired gender, often results in both immediate or chronic pain.

This example represents a potential approach for reducing physical dehorning in dairy cattle without loss of productivity.

Generation of animal models that replicates human mutations are a well-established tool in mice since homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells was achieved in this species several years ago. On the contrary, this was not technically feasible in large animals until the genomeediting era arrives.

Animal organs and tissues are considered to be a promising solution to overcome the global shortage due to the growing demand for human transplantation. The CRISPR system may be used to produce edited pigs to intend preventing hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection mechanisms, and potentially promote tolerance in pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Interesting strategies have been reported mainly including knockouts models [63] . Although the use of these pigs as donors in preclinical nonhuman primate models has been limited up to date, in vitro analysis of their cells has provided invaluable information. An interesting approach to inactivate porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) was reported in CRISPR edited pigs [64] . Endogenous retrovirus is viewed as a potential infectious risk in xenotransplantation of pig organs, and this strategy opens new opportunities for research in this field. The increasing availability of CRISPR large animal models for human diseases and xenotransplantation will help to develop global therapies and personalized medicine to improve human health.",

            "text": "If genetic engineering in livestock has been technically amazing and ethically controversial, its application in wild population is even much more challenging. Gene drive enabled by CRISPR has brought an unprecedented possibility to propagate genetics through populations in wild species. Since 2015, CRISPR was finetuned to develop a genetic system with the ability to 'drive' themselves and nearby genes through populations, in a greater frequency than predicted by Mendelian inheritance. In sexual reproduction, offspring inherit two versions of every gene, one from each parent with the same opportunity to be transmitted (50:50) . On the opposite, gene drive ensures that the genetic edition will almost always be transmitted, allowing the variant to rapidly spread through a given population. This application differs from classic gene editing by associating a sequence that expresses a CRISPR endonuclease to the RNA guide into the target site, cutting the sister allele in the homologous chromosome. DNA repair occurs by HDR, and CRISPR and any additional sequence included in the cassette is copied onto the homologous chromosome. The system ensures homozygosity for the edited segment. This kind of 'super-Mendelian' inheritance makes possible to drive any edition through the desired population, and if the edition compromises essential traits, the entire population is suppressed. Thus, when applied in pests affecting livestock, the environment (or fauna) where large animals will be raised can be engineered. After releasing relatively few edited insects in wildlife, a great impact in a given target population is expected, including eradication or extinction. For this reason, gene drive is as promising as controversial.",

In livestock, these species usually compete for the same resources than humans, and they can generate losses either by a direct effect on the host or by acting as a vector of other diseases. Approximately 6 million metric tons of pesticides are sprayed onto the global landscape each year [65] . Because chemical-based farming contributes negatively to sustainability, the exploration of different approaches is encouraged. Gene drive holds the potential to control pests without the use of chemicals or pesticides [66] . As preliminary advances, gene drive system has been successfully reported in proof-ofconcept studies in insects [67, 68] , mainly with the focus on controlling vector-borne diseases. Interesting ongoing projects and novel ideas are being explored nowadays, mainly in human vectorborne diseases; in our case we are involved in a collaborative project to suppress screwworm fly population (Cochliomyia hominivorax) that produce important loses in livestock in South America. After the insects, targeting invasive vertebrate pests affecting livestock, agriculture and wildlife will be for sure the next step. Application of this technology will require a global discussion and a case by case study; who decides to use gene drive and when, is a big challenge for the coming years.",

This technology allows moulding the animal kingdom and the environment as never achieved before, in order to pursue human purposes to enhance global well-being. Once the technical challenge has been overcome, the focus will become political. Who decides, and when and how it should be regulated, are questions under current debate. Any decision that could affect the global population must be collectively discussed. In the end, probably sooner rather than later, this technology will be applied as part of the globalization we all live in. Restrictive regulations in some countries will become opportunities for others; those who excessively restrict biotechnology today will pay-per-use tomorrow.
