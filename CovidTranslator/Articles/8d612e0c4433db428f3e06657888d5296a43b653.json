A hierarchy was applied in the order of variables presented above, where those presentations missing a principal diagnosis were classified using the symptom code, those missing both a principal diagnosis and symptom code were classified using the diagnosis at discharge and so on. We maintained specific diseases as their own category if the group was large enough to analyse (category size ranged from 710 to 118,251 presentations). Other less common conditions were grouped with similar conditions, for example, sinusitis and pharyngitis were included in other upper respiratory diseases. We also identified presentations that could be related to respiratory infections (e.g., febrile convulsions) and respiratory infection symptoms (e.g., wheeze/cough/crackles). Finally, some chronic conditions were specifically included to capture conditions which may have been masking other acute respiratory conditions or been inaccurately diagnosed due to similar symptoms (e.g., chronic bronchitis). Our coding of the clinical diagnosis and symptom information resulted in 17 ARI categories. Supplementary Table 1 lists the categories with the numbers of associated presentations, the proportion of ED records which the category represented and the variables and codes used to populate the category. A hierarchy was applied in the order presented to make the categories mutually exclusive as text variables could potentially place records in two or more categories. In the final categories, ICD codes identified 66.4% of ARI presentations, symptom codes identified a further 1.0%, text variables 5.4% and the major diagnostic category 27.2% ( Figure 1 ).",

The POBW measure was used as an appropriate measure of foetal growth as it takes into account the gestational duration, foetal gender, maternal age, maternal height and parity. 15 As the location of the ED departments were not available, residential postcode at birth was used to stratify data into geographical regions. The SEIFA used for this study was the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage (IRSAD) which indicates relative access to resources and ability to participate in society for households within the same collection district (approximately 200 dwellings) using information from the latest census. 16 The IRSAD incorporates measures of disadvantage which can be offset by the included measures of advantage. The SEIFA score was measured at the time of the child's birth and grouped into quintiles. Figure 1) . To limit the likelihood that children presenting to ED may have moved from their geographical region at birth, we restricted analyses presented by region to children aged <5 years at time of presentation. Aboriginal status was identified using a validated algorithm in all available records for an individual. 17 Seasonal distributions of presentations were examined by stratifying records by month of presentation. Annual presentation rates were calculated using the year of presentation and tested for linear age-specific annual trends over the study period using negative binomial regression. We also used negative binomial regression to calculate incidence rate ratios for the frequency of ARI presentations in the first five years of life for the infant, maternal and socio-demographic risk factors, entering all potential factors at the same time in separate models for",

Risk factors for presenting to ED with an ARI were similar in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. The geographical disparity in ED presentation rates, with higher rates observed in children from most rural and remote regions in WA was consistent with findings focused on influenza among all ages in NSW. 8 Reasons for the disparities include relative access to general practitioners and hospitals in the different regions. In particular we have seen here, increases in ED presentation rates in remote areas across all ages. It is unclear whether these increases represent a true increase in disease burden, or increases in data capture in remote areas, and there is a lack of primary health care data from general practices and rural and remote health clinics for comparison. There are subgroups of the population which utilise the ED more frequently than others. While for some groups the higher risk of presentation to ED for an ARI is likely because the disease incidence is higher (e.g., preterm children) for others it could be lack of access to other providers (e.g., general practitioners in rural and remote areas). The risk factors for presenting with ARI to ED were similar to those previously reported risk factors for admission to hospital for ALRI including being male, being born preterm, being from a low socioeconomic area and maternal age <20 years. 7 Two previously observed risk factors for ALRI hospitalisation, maternal smoking and higher number of previous pregnancies, 7 were not risk factors for presenting to ED with overall ARI. This suggests maternal smoking is associated with increased severity of disease or specifically with lower respiratory infections. Different to hospitalisation, presentation to ED may be more influenced by individual psychological and social factors of the child's parents or carers. Parents may be less likely to take their child to ED if they have had experiences with similar conditions in their older children and are more confident to manage their child's illness at home. Conditions presented to ED are likely to vary more in severity whereas hospitalisations tend to be only the very severe cases and the decision to hospitalise is more likely to be made by a clinician.",

While some presentations for severe conditions have an ICD code indicating this (e.g., Whooping cough) others could be just as severe but be coded as 'respiratory disease'. This is particularly likely in some remote regions which do not appear to use ICD-coding. Across regions, ICD coding was available for 81% of records in metropolitan WA, and in rural and remote areas ranged from 26% in the South-West to 3.4% in the Kimberley. In contrast, use of the very broad major diagnostic category in rural and remote areas ranged from 56% in the South-West to 96% in the Kimberley, versus only 12% in metropolitan WA. This highlights the inconsistencies in diagnostic practices across WA that make regional comparisons difficult and are important considerations for population-based surveillance in WA. Sufficiently sensitive diagnosis of ARIs in ED is likely to improve the ability to survey and manage specific conditions. The level of laboratory testing in ED is currently unknown and linkages with laboratory data will aid in understanding the burden of specific respiratory infections. While testing results will underestimate the true burden of the specific ARIs because only a proportion of children who present are likely to be hospitalised or tested, it will help us to interpret the non-specific coding used in ED. ED presentation for ARIs is common and has an enormous impact on the healthcare system. The data from EDs across geographical areas provide essential information for ED planning (both within season and by site) and to use when exploring the impact of specific interventions (e.g., vaccination) or modifications to community health services (e.g., establishing general practitioner after-hours clinics). There is a lack of primary healthcare data with diagnostic information in the community in general and these ED data will be important for understanding where to target prevention strategies and form the baseline for evaluating policies.",

Most patients in ED will be managed based on clinical presentation and specific diagnoses might be left to the admitting team to clarify. Rates for specific conditions are therefore likely to underestimate the burden and comparisons with hospitalisation rates for specific conditions should be made with caution. The uncertain accuracy of ICD codes in administrative datasets has previously been documented in other data linkage studies. 5, 8, 27 McCallum and colleagues (2014) 5 noted from data linkage work that ED presentations for pertussis were likely to be missed if only coded pertussis is included, due to misclassifications with other respiratory conditions and use of symptom codes for diagnosis coding. Similar results have been found when routine laboratory data are linked with hospital diagnosis data, with certain respiratory pathogens identified across a range of respiratory diagnoses 28 and 38% of laboratory-confirmed hospital admissions for respiratory infections not having a respiratory infection ICD hospital diagnosis. 27 The non-specific nature of the diagnostic coding also makes the severity of conditions in the ED unclear.",

This is particularly likely in some remote regions which do not appear to use ICD-coding. Across regions, ICD coding was available for 81% of records in metropolitan WA, and in rural and remote areas ranged from 26% in the South-West to 3.4% in the Kimberley. In contrast, use of the very broad major diagnostic category in rural and remote areas ranged from 56% in the South-West to 96% in the Kimberley, versus only 12% in This may be why rates for some conditions, such as croup, were higher in non-Aboriginal children. Use of ICD coding in the data systems also changed over the period, with a notable increase occurring in the rural systems. Sufficiently sensitive diagnosis of ARIs in ED is likely to improve the ability to survey and manage specific conditions. The level of laboratory testing in ED is currently unknown and linkages with laboratory data will aid in understanding the burden of specific respiratory infections. While testing results will underestimate the true burden of the specific ARIs because only a proportion of children who present are likely to be hospitalised or tested, it will help us to interpret the non-specific coding used in ED.",

Annual presentation rates were calculatedusing the year of presentation and tested for linear age-specific annual trends over the study period using negative binomial regression. We also used negative binomial regression to calculate adjusted incidence rate ratios where the outcome is the frequency (number) of ARI presentations in the first five years of life for the infant and the exposures are maternal and socio-demographic risk factors.We explore the impact of all potential exposure factors at the same time in separate models for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children.

This study aimed to examine the burden of ARIs among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children presenting to Western Australian (WA) EDs from 2002 to 2012. Results Overall 26% of presentations were for ARIs. For Aboriginal children, the highest rates were for those aged <12 months in the Great Southern (1,233 per 1,000 child-years) and Pilbara regions (1,088 per 1,000 child-years). Rates for non-Aboriginal children were highest in children <12 months in the Southwest and Kimberley (400 and 375 per 1,000 child-years respectively). Presentation rates for ARI in children from rural and remote WA significantly increased over time in all age groups <5 years. Risk factors for children presenting to ED with ARI were: male, prematurity, Caesarean delivery, and residence in the Kimberley region and lower socio-economic areas.",
