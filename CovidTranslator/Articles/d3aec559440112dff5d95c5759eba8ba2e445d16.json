Exon 2 containing myelin basic protein MBP transcripts are expressed during developmental myelination in mice and humans, and during remyelination subsequent to virally induced demyelination in adult mice. Since remyelination characterizes CNS lesions during \u017d . \u017d . experimental allergic encephalomyelitis EAE and multiple sclerosis MS , we investigated whether exon 2 containing isoforms of MBP are expressed in EAE lesions during relapsing disease. Exon 2 containing MBP transcripts were detected by in situ hybridization in 17 of 52 EAE mice and in 16 of 30 mice at the peak of the first or second episode of paralysis. Thus exon 2 containing MBP transcripts are expressed in lesions of the CNS during active phases of chronic relapsing autoimmune disease. Implications of these findings with respect to future therapies aimed toward enhancing remyelination in EAE and, possibly MS, are discussed.",

Transcripts containing exon 2 and coding for the 21.5 and 17 kDa MBP isoforms emerge postnatally in the mouse and peak before myelin sheaths appear. Exon 2 containing MBP transcripts are then down regulated and alternatively spliced transcripts coding for the mature 14 and 18.5 kDa MBP isoforms are synthesized and mature MBP proteins are incorporated into myelin \u017d . sheaths Newman et al., 1987; Jordan et al., 1989b . In adult mice, during remyelination in a monophasic demyelinating disease induced by a corona virus, the same programmed sequence of events characteristic of developmental myelination occurs. At the site of demyelination exon 2 containing MBP transcripts are upregulated before remyelination. Transcripts coding for mature MBP isoforms \u017d are expressed later when myelin is repaired Jordan et al., . 1990 . Thus, exon 2 MBP transcript expression may be used as an molecular marker of remyelination. The sequence and timing of expression of such a molecular marker during chronic relapsing demyelination has however not yet been characterized.",
