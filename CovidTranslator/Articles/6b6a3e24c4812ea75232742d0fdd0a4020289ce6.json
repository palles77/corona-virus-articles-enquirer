It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th , 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.",

In order to respond swiftly and properly to the outbreak, public health decision-and policy-makers need timely and accurate epidemiological information, concerning, for example, how long it may take from exposure to the virus to illness/symptoms onset or which individuals, with specific characteristics or co-morbidities, are at higher risk of a poor prognosis. However, many data are still lacking and available data may not be accurate or reliable and may contain substantial uncertainty, concerning, for instance, the precise timing and natural history of cases. Simulating different scenarios with evolving knowledge and gradually improved data quality present significant challenges for modelers. On the other hand, scenario analysis could help ruling out some (unrealistic or over optimistic) assumptions, enabling to test different hypotheses.",

Following this announcement, many other cities and provinces of China decided to enforce similar measures.

From the mathematical point of view, this can significantly contribute to decreasing the contact rate c among the persons. On the other hand, also from January 23rd , 2020, gradually increasing numbers of 2019-nCoV testing kits were sent to Wuhan from other provinces, gradually shortening the time period of diagnosis (i.e. the value of d I increases greatly).

Using the discrete values of contact rate c\u00f0t\u00de and diagnose rate d I \u00f0t\u00de, we can calculate the effective daily reproduction ratio, shown in Fig. 1(b) . It follows that under the strict prevention and control measures, the effective daily reproduction ratio R d \u00f0t\u00de has been less than 1 since January 26th , 2020, that is, the number of new infections has begun to decline. Note that the effective daily reproduction ratio declined from January 23rd , 2020 to January 25th , 2020, as a combination of the restrictive measures, including the lock-down of Wuhan, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, that have been implemented. In practice, this time variation of the contact and diagnose rates leads to sub-exponential rather than exponential growth dynamics, and hence provides better estimates of epidemic size compared to fully exponential growth models. We refer to (Pell, Kuang, Viboud, & Chowell, 2018; Smirnova & Chowell, 2017) for earlier studies on sub-exponential growth of modern epidemics.",

We caution that increasing the number of susceptible individuals may lead to an increase in the peak value and enlarge the predicted cumulative case numbers (( Fig. 2(C and D) ), emphasizing the importance of sustaining the implemented control strategies such as self-isolation in order to reduce the susceptibility. We emphasize that the peak time is defined here as the time when the number of confirmed cases reaches the maximum, so sustaining the intervention measures is critical.

(Read, Bridgen, Cummings, Ho, & Jewell, 2020) . Specifically, Zhao and coworkers (Zhao et al., 2020) have assessed from a quantitative standpoint the under-reporting rate of coronavirus cases, modeling the epidemic growth curve using the exponential growing Poisson process. Authors computed the number of under-reported coronavirus cases to be 469 (95% CI 403e540). Based on this estimate, the basic reproduction number was found to be 2.56 (95% CI 2.49e2.63). In a previous version of the investigation, released in the bioRxiv pre-print server, the reproduction number was computed to oscillate between 3.30 (95% CI 2.73e3.96) and 5.47 (95% CI 4.16e7.10). The basic reproduction number was also found to be associated with 0-folde2-fold increase in the reporting rate. More in detail, with report rates increasing over the time, the mean value was statistically likely to be higher than 3 but less than 5. Read and coauthors (Read et al., 2020) used a deterministic SEIR model, assuming coronavirus cases being Poisson distributed and with parameter inference being achieved by maximum likelihood estimation utilizing the Nelder-Mead optimization approach. According to the dynamics transmission model, an ascertainment rate of 5.0% (95% CI 3.6e7.4) was computed and, based on this, authors estimated that as of January 22nd , 2020 in Wuhan there were 14,464 (95% CI 6510e25095) infected individuals, and 21,022 (95% CI 11,090e33,490) infections. The basic reproduction number was computed to be 3.11 (95% CI 2.39e4.13). In terms of public health implications, in order to stop the outbreak, at least 58e76% of transmissions should be blocked.",

            "text": "There are three further models incorporating data from international travels: the models of Imai and coauthors (Imai et al., 2020) , of Kucharski et al. (Kucharski et al., 2020) and of Wu and collaborators (Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020) . In particular, Imai and coworkers (Imai et al., 2020 ) estimated a reproduction number of 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5e3.5). Depending on the different scenarios and levels of zoonotic exposure, the reproduction number was found to vary from 1.7 to 2.6 to 1.9e4.2. Depending on the different estimates of generation time, the reproduction number oscillated from 1.3 to 2.7 to 1.7e4.3. Based Fig. 2 . Predictions and effect of control measures on infection based on assumption that parameters obtained from fitting the data from January 23rd to January 29th , 2020 (and hence the interventions) remain unchanged. (AeB) Decreasing the minimum contact rate after January 29th , 2020; (CeD) Decreasing/increasing the susceptible population size as of January 29th , 2020. on the level of infectiousness, the reproduction number varied in the range of 1.6e2.9. Finally, assuming that the novel virus would cause more mild-to-moderate cases than the SARS virus, the reproduction number would be 2.0 (uncertainty 1.4e2.3). Moreover, authors found that only public health interventions blocking over 60% of transmission would be really effective in controlling and containing the coronavirus outbreak. Partially based on the findings of Imai and coworkers (Imai et al., 2020) and building on a SIR model, Yu (Yu, 2020) has computed a basic reproduction number of 3.5 and has estimated that only a quarantine rate of infectious population higher than 90% would enable to effectively control the coronavirus outbreak. Kucharski and colleagues (Kucharski et al., 2020) designed a stochastic SEIR model, based on the Euler-Maruyama algorithm with a 6-h time-step and with the transmission rate following a geometric Brownian motion. Time-varying reproduction number was estimated using the sequential Monte-Carlo approach. Authors utilized several datasets to overcome the issue of unreliability of some data sources and to provide real-time estimates, relying on the Poisson probability calculation. Transmission was modeled as a random process, fluctuating and varying over the time. Similar to the model of Imai and coworkers (Imai et al., 2020) , the risk of transmission and the risk of causing a large outbreak were modeled based on a negative binomial offspring distribution, with incubation and infectious period being Erlang distributed. Median reproduction number was found to oscillate between 1.6 and 2.9 before the introduction and implementation of travel restriction. The study by Wu and collaborators (Wu et al., 2020) , based on nowcasting and forecasting approach, estimated a basic reproductive number of 2.68 (95% credible interval or CrI 2.47e2.86) with 75,815 individuals (95% CrI 37,304e130,330) being infected in Wuhan as of January 25th , 2020. The epidemics doubling time was found to be 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.8e7.1). The dynamics transmission model by Shen and coworkers (Shen, Peng, Xiao, & Zhang, 2020) predicted 8042 (95% CI 4199e11,884) infections and 898 (95% CI 368e1429) deaths, with a fatality rate of 11.02% (95% CI 9.26e12.78%). Authors computed a basic reproduction number of 4.71 (95% CI 4.50e4.92), which decreased to 2.08 (95% CI 1.99e2.18) on January 22nd , 2020. Based on these estimates, the pandemics outbreak is expected to significantly decrease within 77 [95% CI 75e80] days from its beginning. Furthermore, authors found that every one-day reduction in the duration of the period from illness/symptom onset to isolation would reduce the peak population size by 72e84% and the cumulative infected cases and deaths both by 68e80%. The study by Majumder and Mandl (Majumder & Mandl, 2020) utilized the \"Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment\" (IDEA) model and led to an estimate of the reproduction number in the range of 2.0e3.1. Finally, Riou and Althaus (Riou & Althaus, 2020) , using a stochastic model simulating epidemics trajectories, computed a reproduction number of 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4e3.8). Using statistical approaches, namely exponential growth and maximum likelihood techniques, Liu and colleagues (Liu et al., 2020) estimated the value of the reproduction number ranging from 2.90 (95% CI 2.32e3.63) to 2.92 (95% CI 2.28e3.67). Zhang and Wang (Zhang & Wang, 2020) , employing a Bayesian framework to infer time-calibrated phylogeny from 33 available genomic sequences, found that the time of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) was December 17th , 2019 (95% highest posterior density interval from December 7th , 2019 to December 23rd , 2019) and that the value of the reproduction number oscillated between 1.1 and 1.6.",

Furthermore, by comparing the various updated versions of the above-mentioned investigations, the reproduction number was found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the dynamics of case reporting. More in detail, the reproduction number tended to increase over the time in parallel with the increase in cases being reported and the findings were highly sensitive and dependent on the period in which the estimate was made and on the data available at that given time. It should be mentioned that much of the model frameworks and data fitting and analysis have been developed from earlier studies about the SARS outbreak (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004) . It was believed that the SARS outbreak was characterized by a large basic reproduction number within hospitals (nosocomial infection) and a relatively small basic reproduction number in the general community, leading to a moderate basic production number overall. We argue that the current 2019 n-Cov situation is similar to what was observed about the SARS, except that the entire city of Wuhan is the epicenter with a population of over 11 million inhabitants, and the community is the entire country due to the travels done before the shutdown of the epidemic center.",
