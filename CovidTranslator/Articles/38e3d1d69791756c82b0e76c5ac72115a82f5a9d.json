The major cause of death in COVID-19 is due to virus-induced pneumonia leading to respiratory failure (2) . Epidemiological evidence suggests that older age and the associated co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes put patients at higher risk of mortality (3) .

In agreement with previously published studies, our analysis also identified Age to be the most important risk factor for mortality among COVID-19 patients.

Validation of these predictors of mortality in future prospective studies could be useful in identifying and stratifying the risk groups as well as provide necessary healthcare services.
