In this review, we highlight the frontiers in climate change-infectious disease research by reviewing knowledge gaps that make this controversy difficult to resolve. We suggest that forecasts of climate-change impacts on disease can be improved by more interdisciplinary collaborations, better linking of data and models, addressing confounding variables and context dependencies, and applying metabolic theory to host-parasite systems with consideration of community-level interactions and functional traits. Finally, although we emphasize host-parasite interactions, we also highlight the applicability of these points to climate-change effects on species interactions in general.",

These papers emphasized the presence of potentially confounding factors in many climate change-disease studies, calling into question whether climate change will, in fact, cause widespread increases in human and wildlife diseases. Moreover, papers published on the absence of disease are scarce relative to those on its presence and, thus, there is likely to be a publication bias against climate preventing disease outbreaks. This controversy surrounding climate change-disease interactions underscores the need for a clearly defined research agenda. Here, we outline key gaps in data, theory and scale that point to the frontiers in climate change-infectious disease research. We hope that this will help resolve this controversy, synthesize knowledge and advance understanding. We emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of the problem, encouraging collaborations among epidemiologists, disease ecologists, climatologists, modelers, geographical information system (GIS) specialists, sociologists, economists and policy and management practitioners.",

(jasonrohr@gmail.com) Gaps in data, models and their integration Null models Some of the controversy surrounding the effects of climate change on disease stems from questionable null models that can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, although researchers frequently assume that pathogens will experience range expansions as they move pole-ward, tropical range contractions might also occur [17] . It is presently unclear whether range shifts, contractions, or expansions are most likely and, thus, a neutral hypothesis of no change in the geographic ranges might be the most defensible null expectation [17, 20] . Similarly, the need to shift distributions pole-ward or to higher altitudes as the planet warms, coupled with species variation in dispersal abilities, has stimulated the hypothesis that climate change will cause phenological mismatch between parasites and their hosts [21] . Singer and Parmesan [21] , however, recently pointed out that evidence in support of this hypothesis is based on the null assumption of perfect synchrony, despite phenological mismatch being common before anthropogenic climate change, at least for some insect-host plant interactions. Clearly, historical baseline data are needed to generate appropriate null models and test climate change-disease hypotheses properly.",

A wellstudied example is the effect of temperature on the transmission of vector-borne pathogens, such as malaria. At cooler temperatures (e.g. 20 8C), an increase in temperature is expected to increase not only biting rates, parasite replication within mosquitoes and mosquito development, but also mosquito mortality, making the net effect of increasing temperatures difficult to determine.

A univariate analysis might erroneously suggest that the host-pathogen system was insensitive to the climate change.

Ideally, both experiments and models should take into account the substantial uncertainty associated with climate projections, for instance by using model-averaging or ensemble-based approaches [5] . Whenever possible, model assumptions should be made explicit and models should be effectively validated [17] . Improving data collection and modeling efforts will require collaborations among epidemiologists, disease ecologists, statisticians, modelers and GIS specialists. Furthermore, judicious decision-making will require effectively communicating scientific results to sociologists, economists and policy and management practitioners, who must carefully weigh scientific findings, economic costs and public perceptions.",

Second, smaller organisms have fewer cells and processes requiring adjustment following temperature shifts and, thus, generally withstand greater temperature extremes than do larger organisms [39] .

First, it is unclear whether parasites will follow the same metabolic 'rules' as Box 2. A risk matrix for predicting host-parasite systems sensitive to climate change Determining which host-parasite systems are most sensitive to climate change will also help to target management and monitoring efforts. Parasites with poikilothermic hosts, vectors and free-living stages, or that live at high latitudes or elevations, have greater exposure to variable climatic conditions and, thus, might be more likely to respond directly to changes in climate than will parasites with endothermic hosts and direct transmission [6] . Although these intrinsic properties of host-pathogen systems might determine 'fundamental' sensitivity to direct effects of climate change, the 'realized' effects of climate change will be determined by behavioral adjustments (e.g. microclimate selection by vectors), extrinsic adaptation and evolution by hosts, vectors and pathogens, as well as disease control measures. Hence, we suggest that a functional, trait-based approach, which addresses direct sensitivity to climatic factors, coupled with an understanding of control measures and the other confounding factors mentioned in the section ''Gaps in data, models and their integration'' might prove valuable for determining the overall significance of climate change for different diseases.",

Some diseases, such as those restricted to high elevations or latitudes or that prefer cooler temperatures, might experience range contractions with climate change (Categories 1, 2). For example, several fungal entomopathogens of insects are expected to decline [6] (Category 1). Similarly, white pine blister rust, Cronartium ribicola, which costs more to control than any other conifer disease, is expected to decrease if conditions get warmer and drier [70] (Category 2). Indeed, many pests of crops are expected to decrease under warmer and drier conditions [70] . Category 3 diseases show limited direct responses to climate and have good options for control. An example is measles, which is directly transmitted and has a highly effective vaccine. Category 4 diseases are also relatively insensitive to direct effects of climate change, but have less effective mitigation measures. This category might apply to numerous wildlife and zoonotic viruses for which options for management or control are limited (e.g. SARS corona virus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus and Ebola virus). Other diseases are more directly sensitive to climate-change impacts, but might be countered by effective control measures (Category 5). For example, malaria is sensitive to climate change but high capacity exists for mitigation in developed regions, such as Europe and the USA [9, 17] , although it may be a Category 6 disease in other regions where resources are more limited [9, 44] . Category 6 diseases, which are both sensitive to climate and difficult to control, would also include many wildlife diseases, such as chytridiomycosis in frogs [34, 42] and various diseases of coral [14, 15] .",

Finally, understanding of how abiotic factors influence host immunity remains in its infancy [52, 53] , but will probably have an important role in predicting the outcome of host-parasite interactions (e.g. [54] ). Until more of these knowledge gaps are filled, it will remain unclear whether climate change will have the biggest impact on host-parasite interactions at mid-high latitudes, in the tropics, or at difficult-topredict locations scattered throughout the world (Figure 1 ).

To shed light on this apparent paradox, researchers must understand the patterns of climate-induced parasite declines and the dilution effect, the hypothesis that biodiversity generally reduces wildlife and human diseases [57] [58] [59] [60] (Figure 1 ). This will only occur with collaborations among epidemiologists, theoreticians and community ecologists.",

We also expect a greater fraction of human parasites to go extinct in tropical than temperate regions because a higher percentage of tropical human diseases specialize on a vector species (80% tropical versus 13% temperate) and/or a wild animal reservoir (80% tropical versus 20% temperate) [62] . Although parasite extinctions might reduce wildlife and zoonotic diseases, the severity of the remaining diseases could increase or decrease. If, for instance, rare or less pathogenic parasites go extinct more so than abundant or highly virulent parasites, then the impact of parasite extinctions on overall disease incidence and severity might be small. However, the loss of many rare parasite species could be substantial. Furthermore, range shifts could expose hosts to novel parasites, which might lead to more severe disease than in disease-endemic areas. This is a concern for potential climate-induced range shifts of human malaria [26] . In addition, generalist parasites, which might be more likely to persist with climate change (see above), can be more challenging to control because they can be maintained by multiple host species and can therefore persist with higher virulence to a subset of their host species relative to specialist parasites [63] . Increased temperatures might also increase the frequency and intensity of transmission by lengthening the 'growing season' of parasites that survive climate change [6] . However, the same changes might sometimes drive decreases in transmission if host immunity is enhanced at higher temperatures or when temperatures exceed the optimum for parasite transmission. Finally, global warming is generally increasing temperature minima more than maxima and this might be more likely to move temperatures for parasite and vector performance towards their optima than beyond it [64] .",

If extinctions caused by climate change are biased towards these rarer hosts, as we suggest, and these are indeed disease-diluting hosts, climate change might reduce the disease-buffering capacity of biodiversity and increase prevalence and severity of diseases that persist with climate change [57] [58] [59] .
