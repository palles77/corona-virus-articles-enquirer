Also of profound concern are the rare but potentially catastrophic transmissions of avian influenza to humans, highlighted by a recent H7N9 influenza outbreak. Murine and human studies reveal that the clinical course of influenza is the result of a combination of both host and viral genetic determinants. While viral pathogenicity has long been the subject of intensive efforts, research to elucidate host genetic determinants, particularly human, is now in the ascendant, and the goal of this review is to highlight these recent insights.",

The Mx1 gene (orthomyxovirus resistance gene 1) was discovered as a restriction factor that inhibits IAV infection in mice [18] [19] [20] . The murine Mx1 gene is encoded on chromosome 16 and is one of several IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) that block IAV infection, in this instance via the inhibition of viral RNA transcription [21] [22] [23] [24] . Mouse Mx1 protein localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm after IFN-induction, whereas Mx1 proteins from other vertebrates are expressed predominantly in the cytosol. Most laboratory mouse strains carry inactive Mx1 alleles and are therefore susceptible to mouseadapted IAV infection [25] [26] . In kind, hypomorphic polymorphisms of Mx1 genes in pigs and birds are reported to be associated with enhanced host susceptibility to IAV infection [27] [28] [29] .",

            "text": "Many studies have been conducted using mouse models to study the relationship between host genetics and IAV pathogenicity (reviewed in [30] [31] ). However, the conclusions drawn from these efforts must be interpreted in light of the identical genetic backgrounds of inbred mouse populations. To address potential caveats arising from genetic homogeneity, Ferris et. al. recently used the highly genetically diverse incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross (CC) octo-parental recombinant inbred mouse panel (pre-CC population) to study the relationship between host genetic variation and IAV infection [32] . The pre-CC population contains up to eight functionally variant alleles at any given locus with about forty million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) evenly distributed across the genome [33-36]. The authors conducted quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping [33] , and identified four QTL regions that associate with IAV infection outcomes. Among the four QTL regions, HrI (Host Response to Influenza)-1 was mapped to a 0.71 Mb region on chromosome 16 where the Mx1 gene is encoded and is the key host responsive QTL to IAV infection. Sequencing of the respective Mx1 coding regions of the eight CC founder mouse strains revealed a novel Mx1 allele that is attenuated in inhibiting IAV replication. After careful investigation, Hrl2Hrl3, and Hrl4 were mapped to chromosomes 7, 1, and 15 respectively. Several candidate genes were noted to reside within these QTL regions; the Nox4 gene lies within Hrl2 and plays a role in the innate immune system's Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway [37] , and Grap2 resides within Hrl4 and is involved with leukocyte specific signaling [38] .",

Alternatively, such familial clustering of infection may simply occur because of increased exposure in the absence of genetic susceptibility [45] . Of course these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. However, the allele(s) underlying any possible human susceptibility to avian influenza infection remain(s) unknown (reviewed in [30-31, 46]). One possibility is the MxA protein, which is the human homolog of mouse Mx1 and is encoded on chromosome 21 [47] . Although the MxA protein has been shown to be an antiviral factor [24, 48] , the mechanism underlying allelic phenotypic variation within the MxA gene and a connection to human susceptibility to IAV infection and pathogenicity remains an evolving area of investigation. Recently, the MxA protein has been shown to restrict IAV infection in a viral strain-specific manner, with avian influenza viruses exhibiting enhanced susceptibility to MxA-mediated restriction because of molecular determinants residing within their nucleoprotein genes (NP) [49] [50], [51] . Therefore, in addition to SA linkages contributing to avian influenza transmission, allelic variation within the MxA locus may also play a role in avian influenza infections occurring in humans.",

Two of the SNPs were located within genes on chromosome 17, RPAIN -gene of RPA interacting protein, and C1QBP -gene of complement component 1q binding protein. The remaining two SNPs were found within FCGR2A -an Fc receptor gene on chromosome 1, and within a potentially intergenic region of chromosome 3. Two of these SNPs are associated with genes whose products take part in either the clearing of immune complexes (FCGR2A) or complement activation (C1QBP), suggesting that the severe disease outcome of H1N1 infection may result from variations in the host's immune response. However, it was noted that the four SNPs possessed false discovery rates of 22-56% which was attributed to the small sample size of the study [31].",

A missense mutation (F303S) of the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene has been associated with influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE), a neurological sequelae of severe viral infection [53] . TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), one of the intermediate products of IAV replication, and in turn triggers IFN production leading to an anti-IAV response. In vitro assays showed that a TLR3 receptor containing the F303S mutation was less effective in activating the transcription factor, NF-\u03baB, as well as triggering downstream signaling via the IFN\u03b2 receptor, suggesting that this variant may allow enhanced IAV replication [53] . An additional TLR3 SNP (rs5743313, genotype C/T) was identified in a study of 51 children with confirmed H1N1 infection [54] ; this TLR3 SNP was found in all of the children with IAV-associated pneumonia (18 cases), but in significantly less children with milder disease (p < 0.0001), further demonstrating the association between TLR3 and IAV pathogenicity.",

Cells which were transiently transfected with these CPT2 variants also showed reduced fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation (30-59% of controls) and diminished intracellular ATP levels (48-79% of controls) in comparison to controls. Moreover, cells expressing CPT2 variants possessed decreased mitochondrial potential at both 37\u00b0C and 41\u00b0C when compared to the controls.

            "text": "IFITM3 was identified as a host restriction factor that inhibits multiple viruses, including IAV, using several orthologous genetic approaches [60] [61] [62] [63] . Although the mechanism of IFITM3 inhibition against virus infection is under active investigation, it has been reported that IFITM3 blocks IAV infection at the early stage of virus life cycle, and likely at the late endosomes where virus and endosomal membranes fuse [60, [64] [65] . As an ISG, IFITM3 is induced by IFN and has been shown to be essential in restricting IAV infection in a mouse model [66] [67] . When examining the role of IFITM3 in human IAV infection, a minor allele, SNP rs12252-C, was found to be enriched in patients hospitalized due to H1N1/09 infection [66] . Although the exact mechanism underlying these events remains to be determined, the rs12252-genotype C/C SNP affects a splice acceptor site suggesting several possibilities [66] . Furthermore, although the rs12252-genotype C/C SNP is a minor allele in Caucasians it is more prevalent in Han Chinese populations, where it was independently found to be present in 69% of patients with severe IAV infection, as compared to only 25% of patients with mild disease [68] . When compared with patients carrying the C/T or T/T genotypes, subjects with the C/C genotype were estimated to have six-fold higher risk of developing severe disease after IAV infection [68] . Therefore, host IFITM3 genetic heterogeneity may play an important role in IAV pathogenicity and the establishment of pandemics [66, 69] , especially in populations expressing higher percentages of the rs12252 allele as seen in many regions of China and Japan [68] . These data suggest that risk assessment based on IFITM3 genotyping may aid clinical management in the appropriate populations. Moreover, these results suggest that modulation of IFITM3 levels and/or actions may also have therapeutic utility in disease prevention and treatment.",

Researchers have successfully focused on elucidating the viral determinants of IAV pathogenicity such as HA variability and the immune-evasive actions of IAV's NS1 protein [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . On the other hand, human genetic determinants are comparatively unknown, with the above noted studies shedding light on this area of active investigation (Table 1) . With the availability of greatly enhanced genome sequencing technology and super-computing capability, the tools for determining host genetic determinants that modulate influenza infection have greatly improved. The recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic also has provided an excellent opportunity to elucidate the contribution of host alleles in altering disease outcome in the absence of naturally acquired or vaccine-induced humoral immunity [66, 68] . Therefore given the continual threat posed by IAV, and the recent advances in technology, a compelling case can now be made for the creation and funding of a large-scale research initiative to fully delineate the role of host genetic determinants in IAV pathogenicity.

Introducing this cluster into the NP of the MxA-sensitive H5N1 virus resulted in MxA-resistance. The authors argue that human MxA is a barrier for cross-species transmission of avian IAV",

They compared the influenza-associated mortality rate for consanguineal relatives of persons who died of influenza, with the mortality rates of spouses for such individuals. The results indicated that both close and distant relatives of persons who died of IAV had significantly higher risk of dying from IAV infection than those of spouses for such individuals, suggesting that genetic similarities may underlie this susceptibility. 38.
