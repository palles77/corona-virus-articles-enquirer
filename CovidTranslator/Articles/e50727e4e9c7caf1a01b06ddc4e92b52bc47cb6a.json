CRCoV is a group 2 coronavirus most closely related to bovine coronavirus and human coronavirus OC43. A real-time PCR assay was developed for the detection of CRCoV. The assay was validated against cell culture grown virus and shown to have a high level of sensitivity. A range of tissue samples were collected from dogs at a re-homing centre with a history of endemic respiratory disease. The samples were tested using a conventional nested PCR assay and CRCoV was quantitated by real-time PCR. CRCoV was detected most frequently in the nasal mucosa, nasal tonsil and trachea. It was also detected in the lung, and bronchial lymph node. Of the enteric tissues, only one mesenteric lymph node sample was positive. In addition two colon samples were positive for CRCoV by nested PCR only. In conclusion, CRCoV appears to infect the upper respiratory tract preferentially. The CRCoV real-time PCR assay has proved to be a highly specific and sensitive assay that can be applied for diagnostic purposes as well as to investigate further the tissue tropism of CRCoV.",

The disease is characterised by a dry hacking cough with a recovery period of 1-3 weeks, but can progress to a severe bronchopneumonia which may be fatal (Appel and Binn, 1987) . Many microbiological agents have been associated with CIRD; including Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine parainfluenza virus; canine adenovirus-2; canine herpesvirus and Mycoplasma spp. which may act alone or in synergy to cause disease (Binn et al., 1967; Ditchfield et al., 1962; Karpas et al., 1968; Keil and Fenwick, 1998; Randolph et al., 1993) . However, despite widespread vaccination against a number of these agents, CIRD has remained a persistent problem (Erles et al., 2004) .",

Molecular assays such as RT-PCR are faster and offer increased sensitivity and specificity over other detection methods (Tang, 2003; Wang et al., 1999) , therefore providing the best opportunity for the detection of CRCoV. The current RT-PCR method for the detection of CRCoV (Erles et al., 2003) , however does not enable quantitation of viral load. Studies which focus on the assessment of tissue tropism, viral load and shedding are vital for understanding the pathogenesis of CRCoV.

Total cDNA was quantified using the Quant-iT TM PicoGreen \u00ae Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) which selectively detects dsDNA (removed from these samples by DNase treatment (see Section 2.4)) and DNA-RNA hybrids (cDNA) (Seville et al., 1996) . The assay was performed using a modification of a previously published protocol (Whelan et al., 2003) . Briefly the DNA standard was diluted in 1\u00d7 Tris-EDTA (TE) in a fivefold dilution series from 1 g/ml to 1.6 ng/ml. cDNA samples were diluted 1:50 in 1\u00d7 TE. 50 l per well of each standard/cDNA sample was aliquoted in duplicate in a 96 well plate. The PicoGreen dsDNA quantitation reagent (Invitrogen) was diluted 1:200 in 1\u00d7 TE and 50 l was added to each well, therefore making a further 1:2 dilution of the standards and samples. The fluorescence was measured using the SPECTRAmax M2 Plate reader (Molecular devices) with an excitation at 480 nm and emission at 520 nm. The linear standard curve was constructed for the DNA standard concentration vs. fluorescence units. The concentration of the cDNA was calculated from the linear equation after adjusting for the dilution.",

The primers CRCoV NF3 (forward 5 -CCCTACTATTCTTGGTT-3 ) and CRCoV NR4 (reverse 5 -CGTCTGTTGTGTCTGTACC-3 ) were designed against the only available nucleotide sequence for the CRCoV nucleocapsid gene (GenBank accession no: DQ682406) which was aligned with sequences from other group 2 coronaviruses previously published in the GenBank database (GenBank accession no: U00735, AF220295, AY585228, AY585229, NC007732, DQ011855), a group 1 CCoV sequence (GenBank accession no: AY548235) and a group 3 Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) sequence (GenBank accession no: M95169). Sequences were aligned using the AlignX feature within Vector NTI TM Advanced 10 Software (Version 10.1.1 Invitrogen) (Fig. 1) . The primers were assessed for their specificity using the database similarity search program Nucleotide Blast (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). The primer sequences showed no homology with any other region of the CRCoV genome. The primers were shown to be homologous with the nucleocapsid gene sequences of other group 2 coronaviruses, but not of groups 1 or 3 (Fig. 1 ).",

This assay was shown to have a high degree of sensitivity and performs well over a wide dynamic range. The assay was able to detect 10-fold differences, over 8 logs, of plasmid DNA in concentrations down to less than 10 copies per reaction and less than 1 TCID 50 of cell culture grown virus. Furthermore, the presence of cDNA or the use of cDNA as the target did not adversely affect PCR efficiency or sensitivity when compared to plasmid DNA. The high sensitivity combined with its wide dynamic range makes it ideal for detecting high and low level infections.",

CRCoV was also detected in the bronchial lymph node, lung, and mesenteric lymph node. The clinical sensitivity of the real-time qPCR and conventional nested CRCoV PCR results were comparable. However, there were two bronchial lymph node samples which were positive for CRCoV by qPCR but negative by the conventional PCR, and two colon samples which were negative by qPCR but positive by the conventional PCR. This is most likely due to the low copy numbers present in the samples and indicates that both assays may give rise to false negative results. The presence of PCR inhibitors in these samples can be ruled out as GapDH RT-PCR results are positive for all the tissues analysed. Further tests using colon samples will be necessary to further validate the performance of the qPCR with this tissue. Assay specificity for the detection of CRCoV in tissues was high, with no evidence of non-specific amplification observed, except for CRCoV negative spleen and nasal mucosa. Nevertheless false positives generated in these tissues could be easily disregarded through analysis of the melting curve data.",

In addition CRCoV has been detected in a rectal swab from one dog (Yachi and Mochizuki, 2006) . In an experimental study carried out using bovine coronavirus two dogs inoculated intra-nasally were found to be positive for BCoV in rectal swabs on days 1 and 5, respectively. Bovine coronavirus causes both respiratory and enteric disease in cattle and CRCoV may exhibit a similar tissue tropism. In the current study the samples were from dogs housed at a facility with a known high prevalence of CRCoV. Due to the collection of samples from dogs with naturally occurring infection, the choice of time points for sampling was limited and the duration of infection was unknown.",

This assay therefore will be an invaluable tool for further research and diagnostic purposes. In addition this report shows evidence of CRCoV in a range of canine tissues during infection. Tissue samples from the upper respiratory tract were found to be positive most frequently and also contained the highest copy numbers of CRCoV RNA; however further investigation is required to assess the true extent of CRCoV tropism.",
