            "text": "Infectious disease outbreaks often have consequences beyond human health, including concern among the population, economic instability, and sometimes violence. A warning system capable of anticipating social disruptions resulting from disease outbreaks is urgently needed to help decision makers prepare appropriately. We designed a system that operates in near real-time to identify and predict social response. Over 150,000 Internet-based news articles related to outbreaks of 16 diseases in 72 countries and territories were provided by HealthMap. These articles were automatically tagged with indicators of the disease activity and population reaction. An anomaly detection algorithm was implemented on the population reaction indicators to identify periods of unusually severe social response. Then a model was developed to predict the probability of these periods of unusually severe social response occurring in the coming week, 2 and 3 weeks. This model exhibited remarkably strong performance for diseases with substantial media coverage. For country-disease pairs with a median of 20 or more articles per year, the onset of social response in the next week was correctly predicted over 60% of the time, and 87% of weeks were correctly predicted. Performance was weaker for diseases with little media coverage, and, for these diseases, the main utility of our system is in identifying social response when it occurs, rather than predicting when it will happen in the future. Overall, the developed near real-time prediction approach is a promising step toward developing predictive models to inform responders of the likely social consequences of disease spread. This research was funded by Defense Threat Reduction Agency (www.dtra.mil) contact HDTRA1-12-C-0061.",

These social responses may ultimately impact national security and can limit responders' ability to combat the disease, as recently observed with the Ebola epidemic in West Africa (International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 2015). A warning system capable of anticipating the social consequences of epidemics will benefit decision makers and relief workers, helping them to allocate resources and respond appropriately. In this work, we present such a warning system and demonstrate its utility for predicting social response to disease outbreaks around the world.",

            "text": "As social media and Internet news data are becoming increasingly prevalent, forecasting of social phenomena using these data has become an area of great interest. Social media and news data streams have been used to predict targets ranging from election results (Gayo-Avello 2013) and financial markets (Bollen et al. 2011; Schumaker and Chen 2009) to urban crime (Gerber 2014 ) and civil unrest (Montgomery et al. 2012; D'Orazio and Yonamine 2015) . Prominent systems, such as the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) (O'Brien 2010), the Global Database of Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT) (Racette et al. 2014) , Early Model Based Event Recognition Based on Surrogates (EMBERS) (Doyle et al. 2014) , and Recorded Future (Truv\u00e9 2013) , harvest data streams from international, regional and local news sources, as well as social media and Internet forums, in order to forecast major political instability events, society-level behavior, and cyber threats. In the field of public health, several systems, including the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) (Mykhalovskiy and Weir 2006) , HealthMap (Brownstein et al. 2008) , ProMED-mail (Woodall 2001) , and Biocaster (Collier et al. 2008) , have been developed to facilitate outbreak detection and monitoring. These systems monitor data streams for diseasespecific events. Social reactions are frequently discussed in news streams covering disease outbreaks, and predicting the occurrence of social response that might disrupt response efforts is a natural next step for global disease monitoring systems.",

Analysis of infectious disease outbreaks with and without social response has revealed that severe social response occurs most frequently when pathogens are clinically severe or are novel to local experts (Fast et al. 2015; McGrath 1991) , and that countries with low per-capita health expenditure and high levels of armed conflict and child mortality may be particularly susceptible (Vaisman et al. 2014 ).",

HealthMap (Brownstein et al. 2008) , in operation since 2006, aggregates epidemic intelligence from multiple data sources, including news, social media, crowdsourced intelligence, and formal reports to identify health events, often prior to formal investigations. It has been shown that information derived from Internet-based news sources provides early and accurate information for disease detection and analysis of spread (Wilson and Brownstein 2009 ), but the utility of such information for predicting social response has yet to be determined. In this work, we show that Internet-based news sources can used as the basis for a near realtime warning system for social response, especially for country-disease pairs with extensive Internet-based news media coverage.

            "text": "Our primary objective was to forecast social response in response to the spread of infectious disease. Our method consisted of three primary steps: (1) data acquisition and indicator extraction, (2) social response target development, and (3) social response forecasting. The data acquisition and indicator extraction step consisted of the collection of Internet-based news articles describing disease outbreaks around the world and automated tagging of these articles with indicators of the disease activity and social response. This process is described in Sect. 2.1. In Sect. 2.2 we explain how the social response indicator counts were translated into a target for prediction of future social response. This target was created by identifying periods of unusually severe social response based on the weekly aggregated social response indicator counts. The volume of Internet-based news reporting varies dramatically between countries and diseases, so the raw counts of the indicators were unsuitable for use as a target. Instead, we needed to create a target by comparing against baseline behavior. For example, in China 42% of weeks had at least one indicator of social response to avian influenza; 27% of weeks had over five indicators. Therefore, for China a couple mentions of social response to avian influenza per week may be considered normal behavior. In Zimbabwe, only 3% of weeks had one or more indicators of social response to cholera, making just one mention of social response an unusual event. We used a Bayesian network to compare each week's social response profile with a baseline for the country and disease. Then, we used a statistical process control algorithm to identify periods of time that were sufficiently unusual to be considered periods of social response. This approach was derived from approaches developed for rapid disease outbreak detection (Buckeridge et al. 2005; Wong et al. 2003) . Outbreak detection algorithms take as an input syndromic surveillance data and output whether a disease outbreak is taking place. Our algorithm takes the social response indicator time series as an input and outputs whether an outbreak of social response is taking place. Finally, in Sect. 2.3 we describe the method developed for forecasting future social response. The entire approach is outlined in Fig. 1 .",

First, especially for country-disease pairs with high volumes of Internet-based media attention, the social response indicator is robust to errors in the automatic tagging of the social response indicators. A single incorrect indicator will typically be insufficient to produce an anomaly score that is high enough to cause the EWMA to cross the control limit. While data cleaning could be used to limit the effect of incorrect indicators, it also risks accidental removal of true indicators. We believe that EWMA is a more conservative approach, and is more suitable to our particular problem. A second advantage is that the social response indicator is comparable across countries and diseases, since it is defined relative to a baseline for the country and disease, removing the effect of differing volumes of media coverage. Finally, the social response indicator is interpretable. A value of 1 always indicates that an unusually severe social response signal has been observed.",

This type of data structure has been previously studied (Beck et al. 1998) , with the key observation that BTSCS data are grouped duration data. Therefore, it is essential to predict the timing of (1) the transition from a state of no social response to a state of social response, and (2) the transition from a state of social response to a state of no social response. Note that transition from a state of no social response to a state of social response is a rare event, and most frequently our models predict that no transition will take place. Also, note that the signal indicating a transition from a state of no social response into a state of social response is likely different from the signal indicating a continuation of social response once it has already begun. It has been suggested that separate models should be built to predict the transitions into and out of a binary state (Beck et al. 2001; Jackman 2000) , and we adopted that suggestion here for our binary social response indicator.",

Since the sequence of features is of interest in this problem, Hidden Markov Models could be considered as an alternative classifier (Rabiner and Juang 1986) .",

Overall, the peaks in social response indicator counts align well with the binary social response indicator, S i jt . b The exponentially weighted moving average of the anomaly scores (Z i jt ) is shown along with the upper control limit (UC L i jt ). The binary social response indicator is 1 when the exponentially weighted moving average surpasses the control limit disease pairs. Model 0 \u2192 1 exhibited 46% sensitivity in predicting the onset of a social response period in the next week for weeks with at least one articles in the preceding 3 weeks. Model predictions over longer time horizons were slightly less sensitive, but substantially more precise. Model 0 \u2192 1's relatively low precision for the target Y 1 i jt appears to result largely from premature prediction of social response. Twenty-four percent of Model 0 \u2192 1 false positive predictions for Y 1 i jt occurred in the 6 weeks prior to the onset of a period of social response. In these cases, the model likely detected indications that the situation was worsening, but predicted that the transition into a period of social response would take place sooner than actually occurred. Model 1 \u2192 0 consistently predicted the end of periods of social response for all time horizons, with over 74% specificity and over 90% accuracy. Figure 4 shows the predictions for social response in the next 2 weeks for dengue fever outbreaks in India. During no social response periods, the model predicted a low probability of social response in the next 2 weeks. As the onset of a period of social response was approached, the predicted probability of social response increased. As the period of social response ended, the predicted probabilities fell.

Internet-based news reporting on these pairs often does not begin until after social response has already started. For country-disease pairs with a median of less than 20 articles per year, 58% of weeks with social response had no articles about the disease in the prior 3 weeks; 85% had three or fewer articles. For such diseases, the main utility of our system is in identifying social response when it occurs, rather than predicting when it will happen in the future. There are several reasons why a disease would receive little media attention in a country prior to an outbreak. One reason is that the country has a relatively undeveloped online news reporting system, and few articles are published about any type of disease transmission. Other possible reasons are that the disease is perceived as benign and not newsworthy, or that government censorship suppresses reporting. In these cases, it is possible that alternative data sources 9 could be used to supplement data from Internet-based news media to improve prediction of future social response. Another reason why a disease would receive little reporting prior to an outbreak is that the disease is newly introduced into the country. In our data, the emergence of a new disease in a country is frequently associated with social response. There is little that can be done to improve prediction of the onset of this social response, because forecasting the exact timing of the introduction of a disease into a country is beyond the ability of current biosurveillance techniques.",
