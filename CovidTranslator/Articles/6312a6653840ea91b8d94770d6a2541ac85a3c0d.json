The former is responsible for epidemic infections in school-age children and ~dults, whereas the l~tter is responsible for both endemic and epidemic disease. Rotavirus infects all ages, but is bf greatest significance in children from 6 months to 2 years old (2) . It has been suggested that rotavirus is responsible for up to 80% of viral gastroenteritis (13) .",

Many methods for detecting rotavirus, including EM, are not practical for most laboratories. However, the commercially available ELISA assays can be readily performed.",

The test is carried out by incubating a stool sample with a plastic bead to which guinea pig antibody to simian rotavirus SA-I 1 has been adsorbed. After a washing step, any virions bound to the bead react with added rabbit antirotavirus antibody which has been conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The amount of peroxidase bound to the bead is measured by the change in optical density after incubation with o-phenylenediamine. This change may be measured visually or with a spectrophotometer and reflects the concentration of rotavirus in the stool sample.",

            "text": "Under the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS), hospital reimbursement is based on various Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs). DRGs were developed by Professors J. D. Thompson and Robert B. Fitter at Yale University in the late 1970s. They described a patient classification scheme for utilization review. The passage of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) was the nation's first real introduction to DRGs, a classification scheme used to adjust the cost per case for all Medicare patients requiring hospitalization. DRGs represent a unit of payment and in a positive sense, hospitals will now be paid according to what's wrong with the patient. Although you won't see any immediate direct effect, pressure put on your hospital by this system will eventually filter down to and impact on the laboratory. The new system is designed to decrease the cost of health care: hospitals that can lower their operating costs will do well, those that don't prepare for DRGs will be in trouble. In this ar-ticle, I'll briefly discuss how factors such as \"creative\" staffing, improving test utilization, cost-effective purchasing, and even in-hospital public relations will allow the laboratory to survive under the DRG system.The basic premise of PPS is to provide an incentive to the hospital to shorten the patient's length of stay (LOS). In most cases payment will be based on the DRG used and not on the time the patient spends in the hospital; therefore, shortening the LOS will decrease costs and increase revenues. As far as the laboratory is concerned, testing will be more intensive early in the patient stay, and may even begin before admission. Preadmission testing, along with mote emphasis on an earlier, faster turn-around time (TAT), will permit earlier completion of diagnostic procedures and a more accurate determination of the appropriate DRG. These changes will clearly stress the laboratories' ability to coordinate and manage this information flow from both inpatient and outpatient sources. We may elect not to perform certain types of tests because of a long TAT. As is customary in many laboratories, we may not be able to \"batch\" low volume tests and run them only once a week because of pressures to make the test results available earlier during the patient's stay. You will hear statements such as \"don't let the late laboratory result force us to keep the patient an extra day.\" We will increase the number of special arrangements with groups of physicians to tailor our services to their particular needs. For example, in the newborn nursery, blood for bilirnbin assays will be drawn earlier in the day so the laboratory can get the results back early and allow for a midday discharge. In order to handle weekend admissions, we will need to have more services available routinely on weekends as well as evenings and nights when traditionally only star procedures are offered. A patient arriving at 3 p.m. will need to have tests completed by that evening. To accomplish this, our staff scheduling skills will need fine tuning.Another possible way to speed the diagnostic process is to allow the laboratory director to order additional tests as indicated without costly and timeconsuming interactions with the clinician. The laboratory director, in consultation with clinicians, will be given increasing authority to set up and manage testing protocols.An obvious effect of DRGs on hospitals will be pressure to hold down costs. Since labor is the most expensive component of providing laboratory services, we can expect demands to cut our staff. Labor reductions are usually best accomplished through attrition and increased automation. But there are other ways to save salary",
