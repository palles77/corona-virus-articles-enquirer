CVB3 accounts for over 33% of myocarditis patients. 24 Kimura et al 25 reported that IFITs (IFN-induced tetratricopeptides) play a basic role in cardiomyocytes' antiviral process. IFITs comprise five human sub-family (IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFIT5 and IFIT1B) members. 26 Tomko et al 27 identified the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) in 1997 and confirmed by Bergelson et al 28 in 2005. CVB3 interacts via the coreceptor decay accelerating factor (DAF) with human cells. 29 As a type I transmembrane protein, CAR localizes in the tight junctions of epithelial cells and in the intercalated discs between cardiomyocytes 30 . ACE2 has been predicted as receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in case of the similarity with SARS-CoV. The issue remains elusive as for SARS-CoV-2 directly interacting with CAR and damaging myocardiocytes. These issues need to be studied by further evidence. At present, there is no uniform standard for severity classification of COVID-19. National Health Commission of China (5 th edition) 9 mainly classified the severity classification of COVID-19 according to the respiratory condition of patients, such as patient's respiratory rate and blood oxygen saturation are affected not only by the disease itself, but by the altitude of the location. The higher the altitude, the lower the atmospheric pressure and the partial oxygen pressure, and vice versa. P\u00e9rez et al investigate the prevalence of oxygen desaturation in adults aged \u2265 40 years as altitude above sea level increases. 31 They concluded that altitude was closely related to hypoxaemia and might be the most important determinant of low oxygen saturation,inspite of other known factors such as age, diabetes and lung diseases. In subsequent study, P\u00e9rez et al 32 also found that higher altitude of residence was associated with a higher risk of hospitalization and death in patients with influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory illness. However, neither the National Health Commission of China (5 th edition) 9 nor the American Thoracic Society guidelines 11 considered the influence of the altitude of the pathogen site on the oxygen pressure. In our study, we calculated the correct PaO2/FIO2 ratio by taking altitude into account, which was conducive to accurate classification and subsequent treatments.",
