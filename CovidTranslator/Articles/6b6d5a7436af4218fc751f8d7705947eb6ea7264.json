            "text": "Over the past two decades, several strategies have emerged to characterize N-glycans of glycoproteins and identify the glycosites that are recognized and used by the cellular glycosylation machinery. Several methods employ endoglycosidases, such as PNGase F and PNGase A, to release the glycans from the protein, followed by analysis of glycoforms using MS [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 36,37 with or without prior derivatization 38 . The MS-based methods provide a composition for each molecular ion, which is annotated as a high-mannose or complex-type glycan consistent with biosynthetic principles. Furthermore, tandem mass spectra of derivatized N-glycans generated by both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization n-glycans contribute to the folding, stability and functions of the proteins they decorate. they are produced by transfer of the glycan precursor to the sequon asn-X-thr/ser, followed by enzymatic trimming to a high-mannose-type core and sequential addition of monosaccharides to generate complex-type and hybrid glycans. this process, mediated by the concerted action of multiple enzymes, produces a mixture of related glycoforms at each glycosite, making analysis of glycosylation difficult. to address this analytical challenge, we developed a robust semiquantitative mass spectrometry (Ms)-based method that determines the degree of glycan occupancy at each glycosite and the proportion of n-glycans processed from high-mannose type to complex type. It is applicable to virtually any glycoprotein, and a complete analysis can be conducted with 30 \u00b5g of protein. Here, we provide a detailed description of the method that includes procedures for (i) proteolytic digestion of glycoprotein(s) with specific and nonspecific proteases; (ii) denaturation of proteases by heating; (iii) sequential treatment of the glycopeptide mixture with two endoglycosidases, endo H and pnGase F, to create unique mass signatures for the three glycosylation states; (iv) lc-Ms/Ms analysis; and (v) data analysis for identification and quantitation of peptides for the three glycosylation states. Full coverage of site-specific glycosylation of glycoproteins is achieved, with up to thousands of high-confidence spectra hits for each glycosite. the protocol can be performed by an experienced technician or student/postdoc with basic skills for proteomics experiments and takes ~7 d to complete. protocol nature protocols | VOL.13 NO.6 | 2018 | 1197 (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) MS have been widely used for characterization of detailed structural information of N-glycans expressed in different biological systems 30,34 . Freely available software tools such as GRITS Toolbox (http://www.gritstoolbox.org/) are able to automatically process, annotate, and archive glycomics data in a high-throughput manner. The HPLC methods rely on retention times of N-glycan standards for identification of the glycan species. With both methods, supporting experiments using glycosidase digestions and/or permethylation analysis can provide additional support for structure assignments. Such methods find wide utility in characterizing glycosylation of highly studied glycoproteins such as immunoglobulins (e.g., IgG), or detecting individual differences in N-glycans of serum glycoproteins 36, 37, 39 . Although these methods provide key information about the nature of the glycoforms present on a glycoprotein and their relative abundance, they do not reveal which glycosites are utilized or the extent to which each glycosite is occupied.",

The basic strategy is to immobilize glycopeptides by using lectins or by coupling periodate-treated glycopeptides to hydrazide-activated beads. Then the peptides are released from the bound glycan with an endoglycosidase (e.g., PNGase F) that, in the process, converts the Asn-X-Thr/Ser sequence to Asp-X-Thr/Ser. When the reaction is performed in H 2 O 18 , it creates a mass difference from Asn to Asp of +3. Then MS/MS analysis of the eluted peptides provides positive identification of the sites that are glycosylated. These methods are particularly useful for surveying complex biological systems, such as whole cells or tissues, to identify proteins that are glycosylated.",

For example, increased levels of underprocessed high-mannose-type glycans have been reported to occur during breast cancer progression in both mice and humans 6 . Some broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) of the highly glycosylated HIV envelope glycoprotein include underprocessed high-mannose glycans in their epitopes, whereas others require fully processed complex-type structures containing sialic acid 11, 15 . As the structures of N-glycans affect the activity and pharmacodynamics of glycoprotein biotherapeutics 16 , careful choice of cell lines used to express proteins 10 , growth conditions 17 , and purification methods [18] [19] [20] to control the consistency of N-glycosylation is needed.",

            "text": "Given the importance of N-glycans to the structure and functions of glycoproteins, there is increasing need for robust methods for analysis of N-linked glycosylation that can be integrated with state of the art proteomics. Complicating the analysis is the inherent diversity of N-glycan structures present on any glycoprotein, which is a consequence of the non-template-driven biosynthesis. It begins with the en bloc transfer of Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 from a lipid-linked glycosyl donor to the nascent polypeptide by an oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) to a sequence-defined glycosite, Asn-X-Thr/Ser (where X can be any amino acid residue except proline). Although none of the proteins analyzed in the present study contains an atypical glycosylation site (N-X-Cys/Val), these sites have been verified in previous studies by the presence of glycans on intact glycopeptides 21, 22 . As illustrated in Figure 1 , the glycan is then subjected to trimming by removal of the glucose residues to a high-mannose-type glycan, then further trimming to the conserved Man 3 GlcNAc 2 core, followed by addition of sugars by the sequential action of glycosyltransferases that produce a highly related set of complex-type structures (Fig. 1) . Moreover, for glycoproteins with more than one glycosite, processing at each site may differ based on the access of the glycans to the processing enzymes. Indeed, well documented examples of proteins that contain high-mannose-type glycans at one or more glycosites, and highly processed complex-type glycans at other sites are IgM 23, 24 , influenza hemagglutinin 8, 25, 26 , and the HIV envelope glycoprotein 10, [27] [28] [29] .",

For these reasons, glycopeptides are typically enriched from peptide digests prior to MS analysis with different purification methods, such as hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) 29, 51, 52 and hydrazide chemistry 40 . Despite the use of different fragmentation methods, including collision-induced dissociation (CID), high-energy collision dissociation (HCD), and electron-transfer dissociation (ETD), the inherent heterogeneity of glycoforms at each glycosylation site, as well as difficulties in obtaining good peptide backbone fragmentations for peptides with large glycans, impedes comprehensive identification of intact glycopeptides 28, 30 . Annotation of LC-MS/MS data from such experiments is possible by using commercial algorithms such as Byonic (http://www.proteinmetrics.com/products/byonic/). However, quantitative assessment of the relative abundance of the glycan structures detected at each glycosite is still a substantial challenge due to unknown ionization efficiencies for peptides with each glycoform, especially for those with sialic acidcontaining structures 38 . Moreover, if the glycopeptides are enriched prior to analysis, peptides with no glycan are lost, and the degree of glycosite occupancy cannot be assessed.",

            "text": "The protocol described here arose from the need of the HIV vaccine effort for robust semiquantitative glycoproteomics methods that would: (i) establish the occupancy of N-glycans at each glycosite and (ii) assess the degree to which glycans were processed from high-mannose type to complex type. The need stems from the fact that the primary candidate for a vaccine is the HIV envelope glycoprotein trimer (Env) that contains 75-90 N-glycans, creating a glycan shield to protect against attack by the immune system 53, 54 . Despite the dense cover of N-glycans, bnAbs that bind to HIV Env do occur in 10-30% of HIV-1-infected patients 55, 56 . Importantly, some bnAbs show interactions with high-mannose glycans 57, 58 , whereas others show dependence on complex-type glycans 12, 15, 59, 60 . Thus, to support the rational design of an HIV Env vaccine, we developed a method that could assess the proportion of high-mannose-type and complex-type N-glycans at each glycosite on the HIV Env 10 . However, as demonstrated here, the method is broadly applicable to any glycoprotein.",

            "text": "One of the key aspects of our method is the sequential use of two endoglycosidase treatments to introduce unique mass signatures for glycosites that carry no glycan, high-mannose/hybridtype glycans, and complex-type glycans, as illustrated in Figure 2a . After protease digestion, endoglycosidase H (Endo H) is used to remove all high-mannose-and hybrid-type N-glycans that have at least 5 mannose residues (Fig. 1) . This enzyme leaves a GlcNAc-Asn residue that adds +203 to the peptide mass. Subsequently, the remaining complex N-glycans are removed with PNGase F in the presence of H 2 O 18 , which both removes the glycan and converts Asn to Asp, with a +3 addition to the peptide mass. Peptides carrying glycosites (Asn-X-Thr/Ser) with Asn (unoccupied), GlcNAc-Asn (Endo H-treated), or Asp (PNGase F-treated), display similar ionization efficiencies during MS analysis 10, 45 , allowing us to use ion intensity peak area to quantify the relative distribution of the three glycosylation states at each glycosite detected 10, 61 . Another distinguishing feature of the method is the use of multiple proteases, which can generate up to thousands of spectra hits for each glycosite, resulting in >95% sequence coverage. This simple strategy effectively converts the glycoproteomics analysis to a proteomics analysis, allowing the use of robust proteomics software to analyze data in a high-throughput manner. A major advantage of this method is that it provides a glimpse into the site occupancy and processing of N-glycans at each glycosylation site 10 . It provides a semiquantitative analysis of the three glycosylation states, and a complete analysis can be conducted on only 30 \u00b5g of protein, even for complex glycoproteins such as HIV Env, comprising up to 30 glycosites per monomer. It should be noted that hybrid structures, which can potentially contain sialic acid (see Fig. 1 ), are included in the high-mannose-type category because they are cleaved by Endo H. However, hybrid structures typically have low abundance 29, 48 .",

However, neither method provides the precise structure complete with glycosidic linkages between monosaccharides. Although this protocol is designed for site-specific glycosylation analysis of purified glycoproteins, it is, in principle, applicable to more-complex protein samples, such as membrane-enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV, influenza virus, coronavirus) that comprise only 10-12 proteins. However, as described in the 'Experimental design' section, modification of the protocol would be needed to survey glycosites in more complex samples such as cells or human serum.",

The methods developed by the two groups focus on characterizing intact glycopeptides with or without enrichment of glycopeptides prior to MS analysis, and thus can provide complementary information about individual glycoforms at each glycosite. However, milligram quantities of material may be required for their methods, which is attributed in part to the relatively low ionization efficiencies of glycopeptides and in part to the fact that each glycopeptide is actually a mixture of many different glycoforms 28, 29 . Although the complexity is reduced by using only two proteases, chymotrypsin and trypsin, identification of all forms of a glycopeptide with multiple N-glycans is still a challenge, even when using a combination of CID and ETD for fragmentation 27, 28 . Quantitative measurements are also challenging, due to unknown ionization of glycopeptides with different N-glycan species during MS analysis. Moreover, there is limited information about site occupancy, due to markedly different ionization efficiencies between peptides and the corresponding glycopeptides, and/or enrichment of glycopeptides prior to MS analysis.",

Alternatively, for a purified protein, PNGase F can be applied directly, and site occupancy of glycosylation sites can be determined by measuring the ratio of peptides with glycosites containing asparagine to aspartic acid during ESI-MS analysis 28 . By comparison with the protocol described here, addition of a second endoglycosidase, Endo H, provides additional information about the extent of glycan processing, in addition to the degree of site occupancy.",

Glycoproteins are denatured and alkylated at pH 6 instead of a mildly alkaline pH to minimize the non-enzymatic deamidation of Asn to Asp, which can complicate data analysis 65 . To maximize sequence coverage, a number of different protease digestions are used, including digestion by chymotrypsin, a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin, and combinations of Arg-C, trypsin, elastase and subtilisin ('triple digestion') 66 (Step 18) . Of note, a combination of all proteolytic digestions is essential for detecting all glycosites on heavily glycosylated proteins with large molecular weights, such as the HIV Env trimer and the spike glycoprotein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV S-2P protein). Triple digestion alone is able to identify all glycosites in glycoproteins containing only a few glycosites, whereas for most glycoproteins, a combination of triple digestion and chymotrypsin is enough to generate detectable peptides that contain all the glycosylation sites 10 . Another benefit of the use of multiple proteases, including trypsin and nonspecific proteases, is that it produces a sequence ladder that contains a series of peptides with variable numbers of amino acid residues on both sides of glycosite, allowing for highly confident identification for a given glycosite (Supplementary Table 1 ). For single glycoproteins or simple mixtures (e.g., viruses), the use of multiple proteases allows for much higher confident detection and semiquantitative analysis of the three states of glycosylation for each glycosite. However, for more-complex mixtures (e.g., cells, plasma) use of specific proteases such as trypsin will result in reduced complexity and the identification of glycosites while retaining the ability to detect the three different glycosylation states.",

This strategy converts the glycoproteomics analysis to a proteomics analysis, resulting in higher sensitivity of the protocol (only 30 \u00b5g of sample is needed for a complete analysis).

            "text": "Another major assumption is that the endoglycosidase-treated peptide glycosites that are unoccupied or occupied by high-mannose glycans or complex-type glycans are detected equally during MS analysis. To test this assumption, the HIV-1 Env trimer BG505 SOSIP.664, expressed in the presence of kifunensine (high-mannose only), was selected as a model protein (hereafter referred to as Kif_BG505). N-glycans on Kif_BG505 were first removed by sequential endoglycosidase treatment, and as expected, glycosites comprised >95% high-mannose-type glycosylation (green bars), indicating that the kifunensine treatment was effective and Kif_BG505 had high-mannose glycans (Fig. 4a) . On the other hand, PNGase F treatment only was also applied to release N-glycans on Kif_BG505, resulting in peptides with homogeneous N+3 modification (>98% of purple bars, Fig. 4b) . The resulting two samples were then mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1 in order to assess MS detection of glycotypes (Fig. 4c) . Peptides with N+3 and N+203 modifications are both detectable for each glycosite, with a ratio of 1.0 to 1.2, suggesting slightly increased sensitivity for peptides with the N+3 modification. Synthetic peptides that carry asparagine (unoccupied), aspartic acid (PNGase F-treated), and N-acetylglucosamine-linked asparagine residues at the glycosylation site, display similar ionization efficiencies during ESI-MS analysis, further indicating that the protocol is able to semiquantitatively assess site-specific N-glycan processing for glycoproteins 61 . Although the protocol was initially developed for analysis of site-specific N-glycan processing of the HIV Env trimer 10 , it is applicable to analysis of site-specific N-glycan processing of recombinant glycoprotein therapeutics (Fig. 5a,b) , serum glycoproteins (Fig. 5c,d) , and soluble or membrane-bound envelope glycoproteins from viruses (Fig. 6) . It is also likely to be useful in characterization of glycoprotein processing in more complex systems such as whole cells due to its high sensitivity. Site-specific N-glycan processing of recombinantly produced therapeutic glycoproteins, including IgG and IgM, was determined ( Fig. 5a,b) . Human serum IgG, which contains IgG1-4 with IgG1 and IgG2 as the major isotypes, was found to be entirely complex-type glycosylation, consistent with previous studies (Fig. 5a) 32, 49, 52 . Of the five N-glycosites on IgM, which is the major antibody produced in the primary immune response, three sites were shown to be completely occupied by complex-type structures (N171, N332, and N395), whereas the other two sites, N402 and N563, were primarily highmannose-type glycosylation (Fig. 5b) . The glycosite N563 that is proximal to the CH4 domain and thus is a poor substrate for OST was found to be partially glycosylated, in agreement with previous studies 24,71 . Abnormal glycosylation of serum glycoproteins is a common feature in various human diseases, such as cancers and congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). In particular, serum transferrin was first used to diagnose abnormal glycosylation in CDG patients in the 1990s 72 . Normal transferrin has two N-glycosylation sites, each of which is fully occupied 73, 74 , whereas in type I CDGs, an increase of mono-glycosylated transferrin was found due to defects of oligosaccharide assembly and transfer to glycoproteins in those patients 75 . Analysis of site-specific N-glycan processing of commercially available human serum transferrin revealed that the two glycosites of this protein were entirely complex-type glycosylation (Fig. 5c) , in line with the previous studies 73, 74 . Another serum glycoprotein, fetuin, was also found to be entirely complex-type glycosylation, with full occupancy of two sites (N99 and N156) and partial glycosylation of the third glycosite (N176, 89% of site occupancy, Fig. 5d) .",

N-linked glycans on those envelope glycoproteins serve as a shield to protect the underlying protein from immune surveillance and thus confound development of effective vaccines for those viruses 54 . Importantly, some neutralizing antibodies to those viruses have glycan-dependent epitopes 15, 57, 69 , suggesting that vaccine design efforts would benefit greatly from understanding the N-glycan processing status at each glycosylation site. MERS-CoV S-2P protein is a large trimer (~600 kDa) with ~25 N-linked glycans per monomer, each of which comprises two noncovalently associated subunits, S1 and S2 69 . Characterization of site-specific Nglycan processing of a prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV S-2P protein ectodomain (MERS S-2P) revealed that all 23 glycosites on the protein were fully occupied, except for the N104 site (Fig. 6a) . High-mannose glycans were predominantly found in the S1-NTD (residues 18-353), whereas other regions of the S protein, including the RBD (367-588), the two subdomains (589-751), and S2 (752-1,291), contained glycosites occupied largely by complex-type glycans (Fig. 6a) . The glycan N1176, which is in the epitope for antibody G4 and was reported to mask antibody recognition 69 , was found to have a complex-type structure. Of note, we did not observe that the proteases used had biases on specific glycotypes . 2) . Of the 12 glycosites on the recombinant influenza haemagglutinin (HA) of A/ Victoria/361/2011, three were >85% high-mannose (N45, N165, and N285), four were fully complex-type glycosylation (N22, N38, N63, and N483), and the rest were occupied by a mixture of high-mannose and complex-type glycans (Fig. 6b) .",

            "text": "It is striking to observe that the site N122 was not occupied and another site N144 was only 32% occupied on this HA glycoprotein. We also applied the protocol to the benchmark HIV Env trimer BG505 SOSIP.664, resulting in identification of all 28 glycosites with up to 2,000 spectra hits per glycosite (Fig. 6c) . All 28 glycosites were >90% occupied, except the sites N185e, N197, N618, and N625. Of those that were largely occupied, 14 were >75% high-mannose, four were >75% complex-type glycosylation, and six other sites had a mixture of high-mannose and complex-type glycans. In particular, the glycosites, N295, N332, N339, N386, and N392, in the high-mannose patch region, were found to be occupied predominantly by underprocessed oligomannose, consistent with previous studies 14, 76 . The N160 glycan, which is critical for binding of the bnAbs PG9 and PG16 to HIV Env, was composed predominantly of high-mannose structures, confirming the glycan composition at this site described in previous structural studies 58, 77, 78 . Interestingly, the highmannose and complex-type glycans identified at each glycosylation site of BG505 SOSIP.664 matched the pathway of N-glycan processing, in which high-mannose structures are first trimmed from Man 9 to Man 5 before addition of the terminal monosaccharides that define complex-type/hybrid glycans, as compared to the results of the same protein obtained on intact glycopeptide level 29 . Thus, the sites were predominantly occupied by Man 9 if they were 100% high-mannose glycosylation, whereas other sites were occupied by mixtures of processed high-mannose structures (Man 8 to Man 5 ) and simple complex-type structures if they were occupied by a mixture of high-mannose and complex-type glycans 10 . We believe this protocol will be of wide interest to the proteomics and glycomics fields, and will be used by many outside those fields who want to gain high-level information about the glycoproteins they investigate.",
