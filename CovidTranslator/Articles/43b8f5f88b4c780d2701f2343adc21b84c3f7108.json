It started out as a great scientifi c endeavor in the 1990s which aimed to sequence the complete genomes of certain biological species. However viruses are not new to this fi eld as complete viral genomes have routinely been sequenced since the past thirty years. The 'genomic era' has been said to have revolutionized biology. This knowledge of full genomes has created the fi eld of functional genomics in today's post-genomic era, which, is in most part concerned with the studies on the expression of the organism's genome under different conditions. This article is an attempt to introduce its readers to the application of functional genomics to address and answer several complex biological issues in virus research.",

For years the scientists have followed the reductionist approach, where a single gene and its functions and activities are studied in isolation.

Functional genomics makes use of the vast wealth of data generated by the various genome projects (which determine the complete genome sequence of an organism) to describe the gene (and its encoded proteins), functions and its interactions. Functional genomics describes a biological process by taking into account the mutations and R. Ratra \u00b7 S. K. Lal ( ) Virology Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, New Delhi, India e-mail: sunillal@icgeb.res.in polymorphism inherent in the genome that determine its functions as well as the dynamic aspects of gene expression (transcriptomics) and protein expression (proteomics) such as gene transcription, translation, and protein-protein interactions. There is a huge surge in the number of sequences deposited in the sequence databases and it continues to grow in volume tremendously. Viruses were in fact the fi rst organisms for which the complete genome sequences were made available. In 1976, Walter Fiers was the fi rst to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a viral RNAgenome (bacteriophage MS2) [2] . The fi rst DNA-genome project to be completed was the Phage \u03a6-X174, by Fred Sanger in 1977 [3] . Several databases have been developed to access the various viral genomes sequenced [4, 5] . A review by Kellam and Alba [6] discusses the impact of bioinformatics on virology. One would get an idea of the burgeoning number of complete viral genome sequences available if you see that the NCBI Entrez Genomes currently contains 2798 Reference Sequences for 1843 viral genomes and 36 Reference Sequences for viroids as of 22nd June, 2007 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ VIRUSES/viruses.html) [7] . These complete genome sequences of the viruses serve as the starting point for functional genomics. Sequence analysis and comparisons are the basis of molecular phylogeny and provide insights into virus evolution. Such studies in herpesviruses have led to the ideas of co-speciation and the pirating of cellular genes in this viral family [8, 9] . Functional genomics has been used to construct phylogenetic trees by defi ning the functional gene content of the organism. Bioinformatics applied to the complete genome sequences has been used to identify families of conserved genes [10] or protein families based on the presence of conserved sequence motifs.",

            "text": "The methods used in functional genomics are mostly highthroughput techniques that can be applied to genome-wide scale and are used to generate large datasets to aid understanding of gene function. Some well standardized and widely used approaches are DNA microarrays [11] [12] [13] [14] and SAGE (Serial analysis of gene expression) [15] for quantifying the mRNA populations and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry [16] or high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screens [17] for protein. To date, the most successful functional genomics tool is global gene expression analysis using DNA microarrays [18] . DNA arrays consist of synthetic oligonucleotides or PCR probes immobilized onto solid surfaces such as glass or a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane. High density arrays, which have thou-sands of individual probes per unit area, are referred to as microarrays. Data is obtained by hybridizations between the probes and labeled sequences in the applied samples that are revealed by scanning or imaging the array surface [19] . Bioinformatics or computational biology is a crucial tool used to manage, analyze and integrate the huge amounts of experimental data generated by these techniques [20] . Other techniques and methodologies for high-throughput genome-wide analysis that are now becoming popular are chromatin immunoprecipitation arrays/chip-on-chip [21] , tiling arrays [22] , high content fl uorescent microscopy [23] , and RNA interference screens [24] . A detailed discussion on the techniques is beyond the scope of this article.",

Whole Functional genomics approach has also been used to study the cellular innate immune response to virus. By transfecting HeLa cells with wild-type or heat-inactivated infl uenza virus and then monitoring cellular gene expression demonstrated that infl uenza virus modulates cellular events by both replication-dependent and independent pathways [34] . It has also been confi rmed that the NS1 gene product of infl uenza virus functions as an interferon antagonist as infection with a virus lacking this gene results in a signifi cant increase in the expression of genes involved in interferon signaling [38, 39] . Such studies have provided new insights into infl uenza virus pathogenesis. Similar studies when carried out for adenovirus infection of HeLa cells showed that the virus modulates expression of a limited set of cellular genes. The E1A protein of the virus regulating E2F-dependent transcription was found to be a major pathway for modulation of cellular gene expression. Among other genes found to be up -or down-regulated, several cytokines involved in the innate immune response were found to be down-regulated [40] . A functional genomic analysis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in mouse embryo fi broblasts demonstrated that the expression and function of the viral gene product ICP34.5 at early times post-infection has a pivotal role in the ability of HSV-1 to usurp host metabolic and biosynthetic processes for virus propagation and by simultaneously evading the innate immune response by dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 it helps maintain an environment for successful viral replication [41] .",

To globally identify the host factors that function in viral replication, transcription and translation, BMV RNA replication was assayed in each strain of an ordered genome-wide set of yeast single gene deletions [42, 43] . Approximately 4500 yeast deletion strains were screened. This functional genomics approach revealed nearly 100 genes whose absence inhibited or stimulated BMV RNA replication and/or gene expression by 3 -to >25-fold. Several genes were identifi ed that were involved in RNA, protein, or membrane modifi cation pathways, amongst which many were known players in BMV replication.",

The expression of all human genes in 31 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tissue samples and 10 normal nasopharyngeal tissues were studied. Global gene expression profi les clearly distinguished tumors from normal healthy epithelium. The expression of viral genes: EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, LMP1, and LMP2A were found to be correlated among themselves and inversely correlated with the expression of a large subset of host genes, such as multiple MHC class I HLA genes involved in regulating immune response via antigen presentation. This association between EBV gene expres-sion and inhibition of MHC class I HLA expression might facilitate immune evasion by tumor cells, and/or such tumor cells sustain higher levels of EBV. Further, the functional genomics approach established that key proteins involved in apoptosis, cell cycle checkpoints, and metastasis were deregulated and their expression was closely correlated with the levels of EBV gene expression in NPC.",

Besides targeting specifi c viral genes, the host genes essential for the viral cycle may serve as antiviral targets based on the fact that viruses employ several strategies to alter host gene expression. Many experimental studies have gone into establishing the different cellular pathways modulated by the virus, and whether a common theme exists for all viruses or each virus behaves differently?

The functional targets of these ribozymes were identifi ed as the gamma subunits of human eukaryotic initiation factors 2B and 2, respectively.

Besides this, the etiological agents of many diseases are largely unknown; for example, approximately 70% of cases of viral encephalitis and 30% of respiratory tract infections are of unknown etiologies. David Wang's group has previously described a prototype DNA microarray designed for highly parallel viral detection with the potential to detect novel members of known viral families [54] . This microarray contained approximately 1600 oligonucleotides representing 140 viruses. A more comprehensive second-generation DNA microarray-based platform for novel virus identifi cation and characterization was further developed by Wang's group [55] . This microarray contained the most highly conserved 70mer sequences from every fully sequenced reference viral genome in GenBank (as of August 15, 2002) , to maximize the probability of detecting unknown and unsequenced members of existing families by cross-hybridization to these array elements. On average, ten 70mers were selected for each virus, totaling approximately 10,000 oligonucleotides from approximately 1,000 viruses. This pan-viral microarray was used as part of the global effort to identify a novel virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in March 2003 [56, 57] . During an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in March 2003, hybridization to this microarray revealed the presence of a previously uncharacterized coronavirus in a viral isolate cultivated from a SARS patient. To further characterize this new virus, approximately 1 kb of the unknown virus genome was cloned by physically recovering viral sequences hybridized to individual array elements. Sequencing of these fragments confi rmed that the virus was indeed a new member of the coronavirus family. This combination of array hybridization followed by direct viral sequence recovery should prove to be a general strategy for the rapid identifi cation and characterization of novel viruses and emerging infectious disease.",
