Focusing on the appearance of viral pathogens in new host species, I outline a framework that uses specific molecular characteristics to rank virus families by their expected a priori ability to complete each of three steps in the emergence process (encounter, infection, and propagation). I then discuss the degree to which the patterns expected, based solely on molecular-level structural characteristics, agree with observations regarding the ability of animal viruses to infect humans. This approach yields predictions consistent with empirical observations regarding the ability of specific viral families to infect novel host species but highlights the need for consideration of other factors, such as the ecology of host interactions and the determinants of cellular susceptibility and permissivity to specific virus groups, when trying to predict the frequency with which a virus will encounter a novel host species or the probability of propagation within a novel host species once infection has occurred.",

These infections of wildlife, domestic animals, and humans seem to be increasing and more problematic every year. The cause of the recent increase in scientific and public interest in emerging infections is probably twofold. On the one hand, technological advances in detection methods and in global communications allow us to be increasingly aware of emergence events as they occur (Garnett and Holmes, 1996) . Many pathogens, including West Nile virus, monkeypox virus, and H5N1 highly path-ogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus have attracted widespread media attention. Online news sources provide gripping, up-to-the-minute accounts of outbreaks occurring in locations that their primary audience may not even be able to identify on a map, such as the multimedia presentations produced by BBC News in 2005 of a Marburg virus outbreak in Angola (Phillips, 2005) .",

Habitat modification brings previously separated populations into contact and disrupts natural mechanisms regulating population dynamics. For example, increases in rodent populations due to clear-cutting of forested areas for the planting of food crops (particularly corn) is thought to have been responsible for outbreaks of several hemorrhagic fever viruses in South America, including Jun\u00edn and Machupo viruses (Buchmeier et al., 2001) . Barriers limiting pathogen transmission are altered as we change the landscape and increase global transportation, providing unprecedented opportunities for transmission to new populations and species (Schrag and Weiner, 1995; Smith et al., 2007) . These changes have implications not only for human health but for wildlife conservation and domestic animal health. Long-distance animal transport, both intentional (for agriculture or the pet trade) and unintentional, facilitates pathogen introduction (Daszak et al., 2001) . For example, illegal bird transport is the suspected source of the recent introduction of H5N1 HPAI into a poultry farm in the UK (ProMED-mail, 2007abc) , and accidental transportation of mosquitoes aboard aircraft is thought to pose the highest risk for the introduction of West Nile virus into Hawaii and the Galapagos Islands (Kilpatrick et al., 2004 (Kilpatrick et al., , 2006 .",

Much work on emerging infections has focused on specific emergence events, trying to determine when, where, and how a particular pathogen entered a new host population. The emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for example, has been well-studied on both ecological and molecular levels. Strong evidence suggests that the bushmeat trade in West Africa has facilitated repeated retrovirus transmission events from wild primates into humans (Wolfe et al., 2004) , and independent introductions of HIV-1 subgroups (M, N, O) from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and HIV-2 subtypes (A, B) from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) are believed to be responsible for the ongoing HIV/AIDS pandemic (Sharp et al., 2001) . In order to predict (rather than reconstruct) pathogen emergence, however, it is necessary to extend the domain of inquiry beyond the focus on a single disease. Specific ecological processes and pathogen characteristics must affect the probability of emergence, and until these factors are recognized we will have little predictive power.",

Such evolvability is derived from a combination of high replication error rates and the ability to reassort and recombine. Although he makes no attempt to quantitatively determine the relative frequency of emergence for different types of pathogens, Burke claims that recent pandemics in humans and wildlife have mostly been caused by RNA viruses, citing multiple examples (influenza A, HIV-1, enteroviruses 70 and 71, human T-cell lymphoma virus, three paramyxoviruses, porcine respiratory coronavirus, and a calicivirus that causes hemorrhagic disease in rabbits). He goes on to predict that future global pandemics will be caused by groups of viruses that have caused major epidemics in humans or animals and that have high intrinsic evolvability; however, this approach does not allow for identification of viral groups with high emergence potential that have not produced large epidemics to date. In particular, if undiscovered virus families exist that have a high potential for emergence-whether in humans or in animals-a priori identification of this potential may facilitate preparedness for and rapid response to emergence events.",

The first two of these studies (Cleaveland et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2001) used a broad-scale literature search to construct a database of known infectious diseases of humans and domestic animals and to classify these diseases as emerging or not. The authors were then able to describe general patterns related to emergence status. They found that viruses are significantly more likely to be classified as emerging than are bacteria, fungi, helminths, or protozoa and that the ability to infect multiple host species is a significant risk factor for emergence in humans and domestic livestock. A recent update of the work on human pathogens has confirmed these findings with a larger dataset (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005) . A similar approach was taken by Dobson and Foufopoulos (2001) , who surveyed emerging infectious diseases of wildlife based on ProMED reports over a 2-year period. Emerging pathogens of wildlife were also found to be primarily viral.",

I first describe the process by which this type of emergence occurs and then ask the question of whether specific molecular characteristics can be expected a priori to affect the crucial steps in this process. This approach allows for the generation of testable hypotheses regarding the emergence potential of specific viral groups. I outline these hypotheses and then determine whether expectations based on the molecular characteristics discussed correspond to observed broad-scale patterns. Agreement with observed patterns may suggest that the molecular characteristics explored will yield substantial predictive power and a useful framework for ranking virus groups in terms of emergence potential. Inconsistencies between the patterns expected based on molecular characteristics alone and observed patterns highlight specific parts of the emergence process as highly dependent on host-host or host-virus interactions and less dependent on molecular characteristics of the viruses themselves.

While competition rarely involves direct contact between individuals of different species, dissemination of virus particles through respiratory secretions, urine, or feces may be concentrated around a shared resource. Under these circumstances-as with fomite transmission between commensal species-the stability of the virion in the environment is likely to be important in determining the probability of encounter between an infectious virus particle and a potential host species. Similarly, transmission between species that overlap only in their spatial distribution may occur when virus particles are resistant to degradation but may be less frequent than in the case where current and potential host species compete for a particular resource. Figure 1 summarizes the expected interaction between the ecological relationships of current and potential host species and the frequency of encounter.Because direct contact with infectious fluids implies encounter, ecological considerations will dominate the encounter process for the majority of source and recipient host pairs. Molecular considerations will be most important when there is no direct contact or shared vector between current and potential hosts. In such cases, the frequency with which a potential new host encounters infectious virus particles will depend on virion stability in the environment. Two main properties of the virion are likely to influence the rate of inactivation: whether the virus particle requires an envelope for entry into the host cell and the arrangement of structural proteins within the virion. Though the relative rates of inactivation of different virus species depend on specific environmental conditions (such as temperature and relative humidity), requiring an envelope for successful cellular infection may generally decrease the ability of a virus to survive outside a host, since the phospholipid membrane will be sensitive to desiccation, ultraviolet radiation, changes in pH, and ozone toxicity (Cox, 1989) . Thus, the ability to enter host cells without an envelope is expected to increase emergence potential. Similarly, isometric and complex structural arrangements contain many contacts between proteins relative to their helical counterparts. These arrangements are therefore more stable against physical damage, reducing the rate of inactivation and increasing expected frequency of encounter.",

If this holds for virus populations, recombination and reassortment may be the primary evolutionary factors permitting adaptation to propagation within a new host species; however, several virus species well known for their ability to propagate within a novel host species demonstrate that Figure 1 . The expected interaction between the ecological relationships of current and potential host species and the frequency of viral encounter. The darkest boxes represent interactions where the frequency of encounter is likely to be high, the lightest boxes represent interactions where encounter is expected to occur at very low frequency, and medium boxes represent interactions where the frequency of encounter will be highly dependent on the stability of the infectious virion in the environment, as described in the text. For all ecological relationships between species, the actual frequency of encounter via different transmission routes will depend on the exact nature of the relationship. substantial genetic change is not necessary for adaptation to propagation in all cases. SARS coronavirus, for example, appears to have adapted to transmission between humans through a series of point mutations in multiple genes (Holmes, 2005) . Several mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the SARS coronavirus glycoprotein that increased binding affinity to human ACE2 (the receptor for entry into the cell) are well documented and appear to have been especially important (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004; Li et al., 2005) . Table 1 groups mammalian virus families according to each of the molecular traits discussed above for which data are available. Mammalian viruses are used for the purposes of illustration because they are particularly well studied and because mammals represent many of the source and recipient host species of primary interest (e.g., humans, domestic livestock, and domestic carnivores). A rough assessment of expected emergence potential is made by assigning scores for encounter, infection, and propagation potential, which are given and described further in Table 2 . The score indicates how many traits a virus group possesses that are expected to increase success in that step, based on two standard reference texts (van Regenmortel et al., 2000; Tidona and Darai, 2001 ). Thus, virus families can be ranked based on molecular characteristics alone in order of the a priori expectation that they will be able to complete a particular emergence step.",

One exception is monkeypox virus (Poxviridae), which replicates in the cytoplasm but has high replication fidelity and, according to the simple genome-packaging division used here, little recombination/reassortment potential. It is worth noting that recombination of Poxviridae species has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments (see, for example, Yao and Evans, 2001) . Thus, rather than implying that recombination/reassortment potential is not an important contributor to infection of novel host species, this exception may indicate that the simple molecular traits considered here are insufficient to capture the full range of recombination mechanisms available to host-jumping viruses. Of the mammal viruses lacking all three traits associated with infection of a novel host (genome reassortment a Recombination potential is determined by the number of copies of the genome that are packaged in a virus particle (although other, unknown factors also facilitate recombination); reassortment potential is determined by the number of genome segments (single versus multiple). High recombination or reassortment potential is expected to increase potential for both infection and propagation. b Replication fidelity is determined by the origin of the polymerase (host or viral) and the associated proofreading activities. Virus groups that rely on a host polymerase for replication are subject to host proofreading mechanisms and have high replication fidelity. Most virus groups that encode their own polymerase have no proofreading and therefore low replication fidelity; however, polymerases encoded by members of the Poxviridae, Adenoviridae, and Herpesviridae are known to have 3' to 5' exonuclease activity (King et al., 1997; Huang et al., 1999; Willer et al., 2001) , which is the primary type of error correction expected to affect viral replication fidelity. Viruses in these groups are therefore expected to have high replication fidelity. Low replication fidelity is expected to promote the generation of genetic diversity and therefore increase potential for infection and propagation. c The site of replication is considered to be the cytoplasm if all steps in the replication cycle take place within the cytoplasm of the infected cell; the site of replication is denoted as the nucleus if any step in the replication cycle (e.g., genome replication or transcription into mRNA) requires nuclear entry. The ability to complete replication within the cytoplasm is expected to increase relative infection potential, as nuclear entry provides an additional barrier to replication. d The presence (+) or absence (-) of a lipid envelope will affect the stability of a virion in the environment. e The arrangement of structural proteins within the virion is denoted as isometric, helical, or complex. Isometric and complex arrangements are more structurally stable than helical ones due to the larger number of protein contacts. f Virions of some genera of the Poxviridae are enveloped upon exiting the cell; however, an intact envelope is not required for the virus particle to remain infectious (Tidona and Darai, 2001) . g The lone member of the family Asfarviridae, African Swine Fever virus, encodes a viral polymerase responsible for genome replication (Fauquet et al., 2005) . No studies were found in Web of Science searches that examined whether the viral polymerase has 3' to 5' exonuclease activity; however, the other families of large DNA viruses do encode polymerases with known proofreading activity (King et al., 1997; Huang et al., 1999; Willer et al., 2001) and it is assumed here that the polymerase encoded by African Swine Fever virus has undocumented exonuclease activity.",

This is not surprising in light of the expected roles of host-host and host-virus interactions in determining encounter, which are outlined above and depicted in Figure 1 . Determining whether the proposed interactions work as predicted will be extremely difficult. In fact, observation of encounter independent of infection may be impossible, whether in the field, in the laboratory, or using a synthetic database approach. One useful approach may be to look within a particular category of ecological relationships and at potential source-potential recipient host pairs. The relative frequency of different sites of excretion of viruses infecting the source host could then be compared to the relative frequency of different sites of excretion of viruses transmitted from the source host to the recipient host. Databases used for previous analyses of emerging infections in livestock, domestic carnivores, and humans (Cleaveland et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2001; Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005) could be combined with data on the site of excretion as a first step in quantifying the interactions between ecological relationships, site of viral excretion, and risk of encounter. While this approach will measure infection rather than addressing encounter directly, infection implies that encounter and factors that affect infection directly, such as the molecular traits discussed here, can be controlled for in the analysis. Consistent patterns of shedding in the source host across host pairs with a particular type of ecological relationship will indicate that viruses shed through particular sites of excretion are more likely to be encountered than others. As ecological relationships between species change, knowledge of these patterns will provide an indication of the risk of encounter with viral species harbored by a newly contacted host species. In the pet trade, for example, where species that are isolated in nature live in artificial, commensal-like conditions, sometimes at high densities, the expectations laid out in Figure 1 suggest that viruses shed via respiratory secretions, urine, feces, or skin lesions-or those shed in the saliva if animals are kept in close enough quarters for biting to occur-are likely to be transmitted between species. This type of change in ecological relationships was responsible for the emergence of monkeypox virus in the US in 2003, as African rodents were brought into contact with prairie dogs, which then transmitted the virus to humans (Guarner et al., 2004) . Practical application of this type of analysis is likely to be case-specific: the approach may be useful when evaluating threats in a specific situation, such as when interested in risks to a particular endangered wildlife species (specific recipient host) or when interested in risks associated with introduction of a particular species of animal into the wildlife pet trade or wild animal markets (specific source host).",

            "text": "Factors determining a virus's ability to propagate appear to depend heavily the distribution of susceptible and permissive cells within the host. Malaysian Nipah virus, for example, infects lung tissue of domestic pigs, causing severe respiratory symptoms that easily disseminate virus particles (Hooper et al., 2001) . Humans living and working near infected pigs can also become infected; however, very few virions are able to replicate in human lung tissue. Instead, virions replicate in cerebral tissue, producing an encephalitis (Hooper et al., 2001) . Replication in the brain does not promote propagation, and transmission between humans does not occur. A variant of Nipah virus found in Bangladesh, on the other hand, replicates in human lung tissue, causes respiratory disease, and can propagate within the human population (Hsu et al., 2004) . Even differences in tissue tropism within a given organ system may affect propagation potential. One hypothesis as to why H5N1 HPAI has so far failed to produce large chains of humanto-human transmission is that its viral attachment is concentrated in the lower respiratory tract, whereas access to the upper respiratory tract is insufficient to produce large amounts of aerosolized virus (van Riel et al., 2006) . Some ability to generate genetic diversity may be necessary for significant transmission within a novel host species (Antia et al., 2003) , as was seen with SARS (Holmes, 2005) ; however, a more accurate assessment of propagation potential requires a detailed understanding of the determinants of cellular susceptibility and permissivity. Large-scale characterization of receptors used for cellular entry and of the distribution of these receptors within humans, domestic animals, and wildlife could provide an invaluable tool in predicting specific interactions between viruses and potential hosts. While this task may seem daunting, host-jumping viruses often gain cellular entry via membrane proteins conserved between source and recipient host groups (Woolhouse, 2002) . Thus, characterization and distribution studies should target potential receptor proteins that are conserved among and between vertebrate lineages to maximize the practical benefit of this type of basic research.",

            "text": "Knowledge of the factors that increase a pathogen's ability to jump to, and propagate in, a new host will be invaluable in the effort to prevent, prepare for, and predict viral threats to human and animal health. We currently have a good general understanding of the three steps required for a host jump to occur: encounter is heavily dependent on ecological relationships between species and often requires close contact between a recipient host and the site of viral excretion in the source host; infection depends on a viral species' evolutionary potential and the barriers to replication that it must overcome in a new host cell, which in turn are tied to specific, conserved viral molecular characteristics; and propagation may be facilitated by a viral species' evolutionary potential but also relies on conservation of underlying mechanisms of cellular entry and other determinants of tissue tropism. The next step toward being able to predict viral host jumps between species of interest is to quantify our understanding of the determinants of encounter and infection and thereby develop indicators of risk from a given viral group. Virus groups for which the risk of encounter and infection is substantial, particularly those with inherently high evolvability, should be prioritized for receptor characterization, and those found to rely on broadly-conserved receptors should be considered at high risk for emergence. Researchers interested in characterizing the risk to a particular target species, such as humans, domestic animals, or endangered wildlife, may then be advised to determine the distribution of receptors-and any other determinants of susceptibility and permissivity that can be characterized-within the species of interest. GLOSSARY Current/established host. A species supporting active viral infection. Dissemination. The distribution of infectious virus particles in the environment. Emergence. The appearance (or reappearance) of an infection in a new host population or species, or a change in interaction between host and pathogen due to pathogen evolution or changes in host immunity. Host jumps (see below) are the primary type of emergence discussed here. Emergence potential. The probability that a given virus population will be able to infect and reproduce in a potential host species. Encounter. Contact between an infectious virus particle and a species other than its source host species. Envelope. The host-derived lipoprotein membrane that surrounds the protein core of some virus particles.
