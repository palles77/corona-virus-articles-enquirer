Clinical translation of this approach will require chimeras that are effective when administered systemically and are amenable to chemical synthesis. To these ends, we enhanced the silencing activity and specificity of aptamer-siRNA chimeras by incorporating modifications that enable more efficient processing of the siRNA by the cellular machinery. These included adding 2-nucleotide 3\u00b4-overhangs and optimizing the thermodynamic profile and structure of the duplex to favor processing of the siRNA guide strand. We also truncated the aptamer portion of the chimeras to facilitate large-scale chemical synthesis. The optimized chimeras resulted in pronounced regression of PSMA-expressing tumors in athymic mice after systemic administration. Anti-tumor activity was further enhanced by appending a polyethylene glycol moiety, which increased the chimeras' circulating half-life.",

            "text": "We previously developed a simple RNA-only approach for delivering cytotoxic siRNAs targeting prostate cancer-specific pro-survival genes (Plk1 and Bcl2) directly to prostate cancer cells via an RNA aptamer 25 . The aptamer portion of these chimeras binds PSMA 25, 26 , undergoes cell internalization and delivers its siRNA cargo to the intracellular RNAi machinery. This results in the silencing of the siRNA target gene and pronounced cancer cell death in vitro. When injected intratumorally, the PSMA-targeting chimera substantially decreased tumor volume in a xenograft mouse model of prostate cancer 25 , inducing apoptosis only in tumors expressing PSMA and having no adverse effects on PSMA-negative tumors or normal cells. Although the first-generation PSMA-binding aptamer/Plk1-siRNA (A10-Plk1) chimera inhibited tumor growth when administered intratumorally 25 , systemic administration will be necessary for treatment of advanced prostate cancer, thus presenting a variety of additional challenges. In particular, systemic administration requires greater therapeutic doses (leading to higher treatment costs), and carries a greater risk for harmful side effects owing to greater therapeutic exposure of nontargeted tissues. Improvements that would minimize the necessary dose of the chimera would reduce both the cost of treatment and the risk for harmful side effects. Toward this end, we have modified several aspects of the A10-Plk1chimera. The resulting optimized chimeras exhibit potent antitumor activity when administered systemically to mice bearing PSMA-positive prostate cancer tumors.",

First, a chimera with a 2-nt (UU)-overhang at the 3\u2032 end of the siRNA duplex (OVH chimera) was designed to favor recognition by the RNase enzyme Dicer 6 . Second, a wobble base pair was engineered at the 5\u2032 end of the guide (silencing) strand of the OVH chimera by introducing a mutation (C\u2192U) in the passenger strand (G-U wobble chimera). This modification was intended to increase silencing specificity by favoring loading of the guide strand into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) 7, 8, 27 . Third, we swapped the passenger and guide (Fig. 1 ) strands of the siRNA duplex (swap chimera). This configuration was intended to accommodate 5\u2032 terminal modifications of the shorter RNA strand without loss of function 28, 29 . This modification also takes advantage of strand-loading bias introduced by the interaction of the 3\u2032 overhang with the PAZ domains of Argonaute2 (Ago2) and/or Dicer. This configuration favors loading of the guide strand (strand containing 3\u2032 overhang) into RISC 30, 31 . Fourth, a stem loop chimera, where the siRNA duplex (stem) is continuous with the aptamer (loop), was designed to mimic endogenous miRNA precursors.",

These results suggest that Dicer enters from the 3\u2032-end of the longer RNA strand and cleaves ~21 nt upstream.

Loading into RISC was assessed by small fragment northern (strand-bias assay) 34 . This assay allows a quantitative measure of the guide strand of the siRNA duplex that is incorporated into RISC and thereby protected from nuclease degradation. The strand that is not incorporated into RISC is rapidly degraded. The assay suggests that modifications made to the first-generation chimera substantially enhanced loading of the correct strand into RISC. Although the addition of the 2-nt (UU)-overhang at the 3\u2032 end of the siRNA duplex alone enhanced loading of the correct strand into RISC, incorporation of a wobble base at the 5\u2032 end of the guide strand had no effect. Notably, swapping the passenger strand with the guide strand resulted in a substantial increase in loading of the guide strand into RISC (Fig. 4b ). An even greater effect on strand loading was observed with the stem loop chimera, which has the same passenger guide configuration as the swap chimera (Fig. 4b) .",

To determine whether treatment with the various PSMA chimeras results in reduced cellular proliferation, 22Rv1 (1.7) cells were transfected with each of the chimeric RNAs using a cationic lipid reagent and cell proliferation was measured by 3 H-thymidine incorporation (Fig. 5a ). Mock-treated cells (treated with control nonsilencing siRNA) were used to determine the normal rate of cellular proliferation before treatment. Cisplatin (positive control) was used to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell death. As previously observed, silencing of Plk1 by the A10-Plk1 chimera (at 400 nM) substantially inhibited cell proliferation 25 . Lowering the concentration of A10-Plk1 to 4 nM reduced the effect on cellular proliferation by ~sixfold, whereas the second-generation chimeras still inhibited cell proliferation at such low concentrations (Fig. 5a ). This correlated with cells arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, as measured by propidium iodide (PI) staining of DNA content and flow cytometry (Fig. 5b) . Nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing drug, was used as a positive control to arrest cells in G2/M. Next, we determined whether the second-generation chimeras induced apoptosis in treated cells and whether modifications of the siRNA moiety increased their apoptotic activity. 22Rv1 (1.7) cells were treated with 4 nM of the various chimeras in the absence of transfection reagent. Cisplatin was used as a positive control for induction of apoptosis, which was assessed by measuring production of active caspase 3 (Casp3) by flow cytometry (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). As expected, the modifications introduced within the Plk1 siRNA sequence greatly enhanced cell death from 22% (for blunt chimera) to 75 and 85% (for swap and stem loop chimeras, respectively) at a concentration of 4 nM. The swap and stem loop chimeras efficiently induced apoptosis at concentrations 100-fold lower than was necessary for the A10-Plk1 chimera (Table 1) . Together these data suggest that the modifications made to the second-generation chimeras greatly enhance silencing as well as Plk1-mediated mitotic catastrophe and subsequent cell death.",

PSMA expression in tumors was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3a ). For the in vivo experiment, we compared the cytotoxic effects of the swap chimera to those of the blunt chimera. Athymic mice (at least ten mice per treatment group) were subcutaneously injected in the flanks with either 22Rv1 (1.7) or PC-3 cells. Both cancer cell lines express luciferase 36 , which allows measurement of tumor growth using bioluminescence imaging ( Fig.  6a and Supplementary Fig. 3b ). Mice with 22RV1 (1.7)-derived tumors were injected intraperitoneally each day for a total of 10 d (starting on day 0) with either PBS or 1 nmol each of the indicated chimeric RNAs. Mice bearing PC-3 tumors were treated only with PBS or the swap chimera. No difference in tumor volume was observed in PC-3 tumors after treatment with either PBS or the swap chimera, indicating that the swap chimera did not have nonspecific cell-killing effects (Fig. 6a) . A pronounced reduction in tumor volume was observed for 22Rv1 (1.7) tumors treated with the swap chimera (Fig. 6a) . In contrast, an increase in tumor volume was observed for tumors treated with PBS or a nonsilencing PSMA chimera, A10-3.2-Con ( Supplementary Fig. 3b) . Notably, ~70% of all swap-treated tumors completely regressed by the end of the treatment. Of the remaining, ~30% (Fig. 6a , see inset indicated by arrow for representative tumor-bearing mice), the growth rate of all tumors was slowed by as much as 2.3-fold (Fig. 6a) . Although regression of PSMA-positive tumors was most evident in swaptreated mice, tumor growth was significantly slowed in mice treated with the blunt chimera (compare PBS with blunt) (P < 0.001). No morbidity or mortality was observed following the 10-d treatment with the chimeric RNAs, suggesting that these compounds are not toxic.",

The in vivo circulating half-life of the swap-2\u2032F chimera was substantially increased (from <35 min to >30 h) by the addition of the 20 kDa PEG (Fig. 6e, left panel) . We next addressed whether the PEGylation of the swap chimera leads to increased in vivo efficacy. Mice bearing 22Rv1 (1.7) tumors were intraperitoneally injected with a low dose (250 pmols) of the swap-2\u2032 F or swap-2\u2032F-PEG chimeras or with PBS. A total of 5 injections were performed over the course of 10 d. Tumor volume was determined as in Figure 6a . The swap-2\u2032F-PEG chimera inhibited tumor growth at substantially lower doses (Fig. 6a ,e, right panel; 10 \u00d7 1 nmol versus 5 \u00d7 250 pmols). We then determined whether inhibition of tumor growth in treated mice was correlated with silencing of Plk1 gene expression by the PSMA-Plk1 chimeras (Fig. 6f, left  panel) . Plk1 mRNA expression was significantly reduced in swap-(P < 0.01) and swap-2\u2032F-PEG-treated (P < 0.05) tumors compared to PBS control or to A10-3.2-Con.",

We found that addition of a 20 kDa PEG to the 5\u2032-terminus of the smaller RNA strand promotes increased retention of the chimera in serum (Fig. 6e) without affecting chimera targeting and silencing ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . The PEGylated reagent leads to prolonged-silencing in vivo (Fig. 6f , right panel) and to inhibition of tumor growth, at lower doses, in mice bearing PSMA-positive prostate tumors (Fig. 6e, right panel) . Although it is possible that the greater degree of silencing induced by the PEGylated chimera at the 5-d time point is a result of prolonged exposure of the tumor to this reagent, an alternative possibility is that this difference is due to the lingering effects of a greater initial knockdown.",

We found that the first 39 nt of the A10 PSMA aptamer are sufficient for targeting the chimeras to PSMA expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells.

Cancer cell-specific targeting could substantially reduce the amount of siRNA needed for effective therapy while reducing systemic cytotoxicity. Most targeted delivery approaches for siRNAs described to date involve the use of complex formulations of synthetic polymers [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , proteins 14, 15 or charged peptides 12, 13 . Although such approaches are proving effective in preclinical studies, their multicomponent formulations complicate production and safety assessment 41 . A one-component system, which involves the direct conjugation of an siRNA to an RNA aptamer, reduces the complexity of the reagent and thus simplifies manufacturing.",

Blunt, truncated version of first-generation chimera (A10-Plk1) described previously 25 . The aptamer portion of the chimera has been truncated from 71 + nt to 39 nt. OVH, overhang chimera similar to blunt, but with 2 nt (UU)-overhangs at the 3\u2032 end of the siRNA duplex. G-U, G-U wobble chimera identical to OVH, but with a wobble base pair at the 5\u2032 end of the antisense siRNA strand (silencing/guide strand). Swap, sense and antisense strands of siRNA duplex are reversed. Stem loop, hairpin chimera where the siRNA duplex (stem) is continuous with the aptamer (loop). Structural predictions were generated using RNAstructure V 4.6. Binding of truncated versions of PSMA A10 aptamer and optimized chimeras to cells expressing PSMA. RNAs were end-labeled with 32 P. (a) LNCaP cells and PC-3 cells were incubated with either the full-length PSMA aptamer A10 (71 nt) or truncated versions of the PSMA aptamer, A10-3 (57 nt) or A10-3.2 (39 nt). 32 P-labeled bound/internalized RNAs were determined by liquid scintillation counter (LSC) or filter binding assay (data not shown). (b) Relative affinity of A10 PSMA aptamer and truncated A10 aptamers to cells expressing PSMA. Varying amounts (0-2 nM) of end-labeled A10, A10-3 and A10-3.2 were incubated with fixed LNCaP cells. Bound counts were determined by filter binding assay. (c) First-generation chimera (A10-Plk1) and optimized chimeras were incubated with either PC-3 cells (black bars) or LNCaP and 22Rv1 (1.7). Cells were processed as in a. Bound counts were determined with LSC. Analysis of chimera processing by the RNAi machinery. (a) In vitro Dicer processing. The 32 P-labeled PSMA-Plk1 chimeras were incubated with recombinant human Dicer enzyme for either 1 or 2 h. The Dicer cleavage or uncleaved (No Dicer) products were visualized after 15% nondenaturing PAGE. (b) Assessment of strand bias: loading of siRNA silencing strand into RISC. Small fragment northern blot of RNA isolated from 22Rv1 (1.7) cells transfected with 200 pmols of each of the optimized aptamer-siRNA chimera constructs. Loading of the siRNA silencing strand into RISC protects the siRNA strand from degradation (this can be detected with a specific probe using a modified northern blot assay). The strand that is not loaded is rapidly degraded. U6 RNA was used as a loading control. Duplex, Plk1 siRNA duplex; A10-Plk1, first-generation chimera. Blunt, OVH, G-U, swap and stem loop chimeras are described in Figure 1 . Probe controls show hybridization efficiencies of the sense and antisense probes. The varying intensities of unprocessed chimeras (upper bands on blots) are due to differential probe binding to these species and do not reflect their amounts (this same trend was observed when equal amounts of each chimera was directly loaded on gel and processed as described here (data not shown)). In vivo efficacy of optimized PSMA chimera in a xenograft model of prostate cancer. (a) 10 6 luciferase-expressing (PSMA-positive or PSMA-negative) prostate cancer cells were injected into the flanks of nude (nu/nu) mice 2 weeks before treatment with optimized chimeras. Treatment with the optimized chimeras commenced when tumors reached a volume of ~0.4 cm 3 . 1 nmol of either blunt, swap or A10-3.2-Con was administered intraperitoneally in mice bearing 22Rv1 (1.7) tumors. As a control for specificity, a mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer bearing PSMA-negative prostate cancer cells (PC-3) was also treated with the swap chimera. A total of ten treatments were administered for each treatment group. Treatment occurred every day for 10 consecutive days. Tumors were measured with calipers every other day for the course of the experiment. Saline (PBS) treated animals were used as a control. Animals were euthanized 2-3 d after the last treatment. n \u2265 10 mice per treatment group. Bottom panels: Bioluminescence imaging of 22Rv1 (1.7) and PC-3 prostate tumors was carried out after treatment with optimized chimeras (day 10). Examples show tumor growth in four",
