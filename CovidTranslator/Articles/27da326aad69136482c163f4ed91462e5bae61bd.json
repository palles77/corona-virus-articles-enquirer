The aerosol size was measured using an Andersen sampler. Eight first stage HEPA filters (numbered 1-8) were distributed in contaminated labs and exhausts from each of the first stage HEPA filters were aggregated and filtered through one second stage HEPA filter before being released to the environment. In total, 8 first-stage and 1 second-stage HEPA filters from the BSL-3 air purification system were analyzed. No S. marcescens was detected in first stage filters 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 and the second stage HEPA filter. The filtration efficiencies against aerosolized S. marcescens were >99.9999%. First stage filter numbers 3 and 6 had filtration efficiencies of 99.9825% and 99.9906%, respectively. When filter number 3 was replaced by a new filter and the bracket for filter number 6 was sealed, no aerosolized S. marcescens was detected in the filtered air. Our work suggests that the BSL-3 laboratory HEPA filter air purification system is effective against bacterial aerosols, with little to no bacterial leakage into the environment.",

Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H5N1 avian influenza, H1N1 influenza and many other emerging diseases have either proven fatal or caused international alarm. Following the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, the concept of aerosol transmission has been widely accepted (Tang, Li, Eames, Chan, & Ridgway, 2006) . Infectious diseases remain the major causes of morbidity and mortality in China, despite substantial progress in their control and treatment (Wang et al., 2008) . China is significantly impacted by emerging infectious diseases because of its population size and density. The public health system must be prepared to handle the challenges presented by new infectious diseases, while at the same time controlling existing infectious diseases. One of the most critical roadblocks to developing biodefense countermeasures is a lack of specialized research resources, in particular, specialized biocontainment laboratories. To address infectious microbial threats, the government has committed resources to implement new research strategies, including the development of biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories.",

            "text": "BSL-3 laboratories are designed to work with risk group 3 microorganisms in large volumes or high concentrations of risk group 2 microorganisms that pose a high risk of aerosol transmission (WHO, 2004) . The general public often opposes high level biosafety laboratories because of the potential for leakage of infectious microorganisms to the environment (Kaiser, 2004; Nisbet, 2007) . High-efficiency particulate (HEPA) air filtration systems are used to reduce the airborne release of microbial aerosols. HEPA filters are usually tested using physical particles as challenge aerosols (ASTM, 2009 ), even though their use is frequently to reduce exposure to biological particles. Attempts to evaluate the performance of respiratory protective equipment against biological particles have typically been performed using airborne bacteria and viruses (Balazy et al., 2006; Eninger et al., 2008; Qian, Willeke, Grinshpun, Donnelly, & Coffey, 1998) . Studies on respiratory protective equipment against airborne biological agents have recently been reviewed by Rengasamy, Zhuang, and BerryAnn (2004) . There is, however, a lack of direct measurements on the efficiency of BSL-3 laboratory HEPA filtration systems against aerosolized biological particles. The BSL-3 laboratory in this study was constructed for group 3 bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To ensure there is no environmental leak risk, the performance of the BSL-3 laboratory HEPA air filtration system was studied using microbiological aerosol methodology. The bacterial aerosol was generated in the BSL-3 lab containment area and then sampled before and after the testing filters when the BSL-3 lab was operated under normal working conditions. This methodology could be applied anywhere to determine the efficacy of BSL-3 laboratory HEPA filtration systems for reducing airborne contamination by airborne bacteria and evaluate bioaerosol leakage risks for the environment. This is the first attempt to evaluate the HEPA filtration system of BSL-3 lab against airborne bacteria aerosol under normal working conditions.",

It was used as a substitute for high risk bacteria. After incubation, the red colonies of S. marcescens could be discriminated from other microorganisms (Fig. 2 ). S. marcescens was aseptically inoculated in a flask using 150 mL of nutrient broth (10 g peptone, 3 g beef extract, 5 g NaCl and 1 L deionized water at a pH of 7.3 \u00b1 0.2) (HuanKai Microbial Sci. & Tech Co., Ltd, Guangdong, China) and then incubated for 24 h at 30 \u2022 C with shaking (160 rpm).

The operating principle of the DV40 nebulizer is similar to that of the collision nebulizer where compressed air shears liquid into droplets. The larger size fraction of droplets was removed and the smaller fraction was ejected by the nebulizer. S. marcescens was aerosolized by applying clean compressed air using a GAST pump (GAST Manufacturing Inc., MI, USA) to the nebulizer at the flow rate 10 L/min and the aerosolization time was 5 min. Before and after aerosolization the concentration of S. marcescens was determined using the serial dilution culture method described in Section 2.1. Each media was tested three times and the best aerosolization media was selected. The results from different aerosolization media were analyzed using SPSS 11.0 and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

            "text": "There is constant concern about the health and safety of individuals and the environment being exposed to pathogenic microorganisms. Along with safe microbiological techniques, primary barriers (safety equipment and personal protective equipment) minimize the occupational exposure of laboratory workers and limit the transmission of microorganisms from these workers to others. Secondary barriers (facility safeguards) provide supplementary microbiological containment, serving mainly to prevent the escape of infectious agents into the environment when a failure in the primary barriers occurs (Kimman, Smit, & Klein, 2008) . Air filtration systems with HEPA filters are one of the most important secondary barriers to prevent the escape of infectious agents from a BSL-3 lab to the environment. The adverse health effects of biological particles, particularly their pathogenicity, do not depend on the mass of the inhaled particles, but on the number of particles inhaled. Traditional vaccines may not provide adequate protection to humans when infection occurs via inhalation (Ivins et al., 1995; Reed & Martinez, 2006) . For example, inhalation of one Coxiella burnetti bacterium can induce Q fever (Tigertt, Benenson, & Gochenour, 1961) . Studies evaluating protection efficiencies of BSL-3 lab HEPA filtration system using biological aerosols are scarce, highlighting a significant gap in current knowledge. The HEPA filtration system of a specially designed BSL-3 laboratory for the autopsies of patients with SARS was evaluated using a physical particle simulant test (Li et al., 2005) . Air filter sets were tested for their efficiency in protecting laboratory animals against potential airborne infections (Mrozek et al., 1994) . There have been no reports evaluating the performance of air filtration systems in BSL-3 labs using the deliberate release of model microorganisms in an actual working laboratory setting. Because of the unique aerosol properties of bioaerosols, special equipment used for protection against the aerosol transmission of diseases was required to undergo bioaerosol protection testing (Rengasamy et al., 2004) . Because of aerosol safety issues involved with the generation of high microbial aerosol concentrations, the method uses non-pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, a bacterial model (S. marcescens) was used to test the efficiency of an air purification system in a BSL-3 lab. S. marcescens has been used previously as model bacterial aerosol because of its high aerosol stability and low pathogenicity (Furuhashi & Miyamae, 1981; Heidelberg et al., 1997; Ko & Burge, 2007; Ko, First, & Burge, 2000; Lai, Burge, & First, 2004; Patel & Nou, 2008) . The BSL-3 lab studied was used to do bacterial research, so S. marcescens was an excellent candidate as a bacterial model organism. In the future, a viral model aerosol should also be used to investigate the risk associated with performing viral research.",

            "text": "The aerosolization and collection processes can inactivate or kill some microorganisms. Microorganisms are subjected to numerous stresses during the aerosol generation and collection processes within a device (Liu et al., 2012) . Maintaining their integrity and activity depends on the nature of the nebulizers, samplers, and media. In this study, S. marcescens aerosol generation and collection methods were studied. The aerosol particles size was also measured. In this study, the CMD of S. marcescens aerosol was 1.77 m. Because a dryer was not used, water aerosolized by the DV40 nebulizer was not evaporated, increasing the number of larger particles that can carry single bacteria or bacterial agglomerates. S. marcescens aerosol was deliberately released into potentially contaminated areas when the BSL-3 lab was in normal operation. This test method not only evaluated the HEPA filters, but also the installation parameters of the filters, such as airproofing of the fixed filter bracket, airproofing glue, the fixed screw, and whether the HEPA filter was damaged during the installation. In our study, filters 3 and 6 showed filtration efficiencies against S. marcescens of 99.9825% and 99.9906%. Only HEPA filter 3 was leaking from the filter itself, as determined by aerosol testing after it was removed from the filtration system. It may have been damaged during the transport and the installation processes. Filter 6 was determined to be intact by aerosol testing and it was concluded that S. marcescens aerosol was leaked through other routes. After the fixed filter bracket was airproofed using airproofing glue, there was no S. marcescens aerosol detected, so indicating that the aerosol was leaking from the fixed bracket. There was no S. marcescens aerosol detected in the second stage HEPA filters.",

(2008) recommended developing evidence-based practices and criteria to evaluate effectiveness wherever this is possible and feasible. This may optimize, and perhaps, simplify future biosafety measures and stimulate compliance with applicable regulations. In this paper we studied a testing method for evaluating the efficiency of air filtration systems in a BSL-3 lab using the deliberate release of bacterial aerosol in a working laboratory setting. The method included a substitute bacteria, bacterial aerosol nebulizer, samplers, aerosolized bacteria, and collection media. In the BSL-3 lab, the S. marcescens aerosol concentration was >10 3 cfu/L and mimicked a seriously contaminated status and no S. marcescens was detected in the exhaust air. The air filtration system of this BSL-3 lab had excellent filtration efficiency against bacterial aerosol.",
