            "text": "Asthma is a growing epidemic worldwide. Exacerbations of asthma have been associated with bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections and air pollution. We correlated the asthma admission rates with fluctuations in respiratory virus activity and traffic-related air pollution, namely particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u2264 10 \u03bcm (PM 10 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), and ozone (O 3 ). A probabilistic risk assessment framework was developed based on a detrended fluctuation analysis to predict future respiratory virus and air pollutant associated asthma incidence. Results indicated a strong association between asthma admission rate and influenza (r = 0.80, p b 0.05) and SO 2 level (r = 0.73, p b 0.05) in Taiwan in the period 2001-2008. No significant correlation was found for asthma admission and PM 10 , O 3 , NO 2 , and CO. The proposed fluctuation analysis provides a simple correlation exponent describing the complex interactions of respiratory viruses and air pollutants with asthma. This study revealed that there was a 95% probability of having exceeded 2987 asthma admissions per 100,000 population. It was unlikely (30% probability) that the asthma admission rate exceeded 3492 per 100,000 population. The probability of asthma admission risk can be limited to below 50% by keeping the correlation exponent of influenza to below 0.9. We concluded that fluctuation analysis based risk assessment provides a novel predictor of asthma incidence.",

Asthma is primarily characterized by airflow obstruction resulting from inflammation and remodeling of small airways. Asthma is a multidimensional disease, with several systemic manifestations, and it is associated with a number of co-morbid diseases (Pearce and Douwes, 2006) . It is clear that much more clinical and basic research is needed to understand the complexity of asthma, so that more effective management of asthma and its various co-morbidities are possible in the future.",

            "text": "It is generally recognized that air pollution exacerbates asthma in children (Schildcrout et al., 2006) . Recent studies have shown that both PM 10 and NO 2 have been associated with increases in the frequency of asthma symptoms and with lung function decrements in children (Ostro et al., 2001; Schildcrout et al., 2006; Jerrett et al., 2008; Weinmayr et al., 2010) . Current evidence indicates that PM 10 increases cough, lower respiratory symptoms, and lower peak expiratory flow (PEF) (Ward and Ayres, 2004; Nel, 2005) . Recently, Weinmayr et al. (2010) , using meta-analysis, provided strong evidence that PM 10 may be an aggravating factor of asthma in children. Papi et al. (2006) indicated that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was significantly exacerbated by respiratory viral infections that caused reduction of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) and airway inflammation. On assessing the effects of a winter influenza season on patients with COPD, Gorse et al. (2006) found that laboratory-documented influenza-caused illness was associated significantly with lower FEV 1 . Ko et al. (2007a) reported that the most prevalent viruses detected during acute exacerbations of COPD in Hong Kong were the influenza A virus and coronavirus. They indicated that among 196 patients with a mean age of 76 years, mean FEV 1 was 40% of predicted normal and the FEV 1 /FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio was reduced to 58% of normal. Singh and Busse (2006) and De Serres et al. (2009) also suggested that the influenza virus frequently causes acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD.",

Frey et al. (2005) indicated that chronic asthma could be treated as a dynamic disease of the respiratory system. Frey et al. (2005) employed DFA to predict the risk of airflow obstruction by calculating a conditional probability. They also revealed that DFA could characterize long-range temporal patterns of lungfunction. Thus, Frey (2007) and Frey and Suki (2008) suggested that correlations can be used to assess the risk of future asthma episodes and to improve the assessment of asthma severity for children and adults. On the other hand, DFA has also been applied to investigate the timescaling properties of air pollution time series including NO 2 , SO 2 , O 3 , and PM 10 (Varotsos et al., 2005; Shi et al., 2008) .",

To assess the risk of asthma incidence, we corrected DFAderived \u03b1 v from respiratory virus activity and asthma admission rate to construct a mechanistic relationship: asthma admission rate = f(\u03b1 v ).

A value of p b 0.05 was judged significant. To quantify the uncertainty and its impact on the estimation of expected risk, a Monte Carlo (MC) technique was implemented. The MC simulation algorithm depends on the statistics of input parameter and all possible distributions of parameters can be simulated considering random sampling of probability outcomes. The Monte Carlo simulation was performed with 10,000 iterations to generate 2.5-and 97.5-percentiles as the 95% CI for all fitted models. The Crystal Ball\u00ae software (Version 2000.2, Decisionerring, Inc., Denver, Colorado, USA) was employed to implement the MC simulation. Fig. 1 illustrates the computational algorithm implemented in this study. Fig. 3 illustrates the daily positive rate data of total respiratory viruses (including adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, and RSV) and influenza in the Taiwan region from 2001 to 2008. We found that Kaohsiung had relative higher annual mean values (8 years) of PM 10 (~76 \u03bcg m \u2212 3 ), SO 2 (~8 ppb), and O 3 (~31 ppb) levels than Taipei (~50 \u03bcg m \u2212 3 for PM 10 ,~4 ppb for SO 2 , and~24 ppb for O 3 ), whereas there was no significant difference in CO (~0.7 ppm) and NO 2 (~24 ppb) levels (Table 1, Fig. 2) .

Generally, NO 2 effects were often the strongest and appeared to be generally independent of the impact of other pollutants on asthma or asthma-like symptoms (Guo et al., 1999; Barnett et al., 2005; Gauderman et al., 2005; Tsai et al., 2006; Jerrett et al., 2008; Weinmayr et al., 2010) . However, differences have been observed among cities with different climates during short-or long-term exposures (Bouhuys et al., 1978; Oftedal et al., 2009) . Bouhuys et al. (1978) found that, in US towns, high concentrations of SO 2 , NO 2 , and total suspended particulates were not associated with lung function loss when sex, race, age, height, and weight were adequately taken into account. Chen et al. (2007) observed no clear dose-response fashion relationships between health risk response and increasing amounts of air pollutants such as NO 2 , SO 2 , and CO. Oftedal et al. (2009) reported that no positive associations were found between long-term NO 2 exposures and asthma onset or respiratory symptoms in 9-10-year old children in Oslo. It has been suggested that airborne viral infections are a major risk factor for exacerbations of chronic asthma and COPD (Mallia and Johnston, 2006; Varkey and Varkey, 2008) . In addition, airborne virus infections cause virus-induced damage and innate inflammation (Cameron et al., 2006; Proud and Chow, 2006) . Mallia and Johnston (2006) indicated exacerbations were associated with virus-induced airway diseases. In asthmatic subjects, virus isolation studies have found that influenza infections have been detected in most cases of hospitalization, resulting in near-fatal and acute exacerbations (Teichtahl et al., 1997; Tan et al., 2003) .

We think there is room for further improvement, especially by including experimental analysis of airborne virus infection on respiratory symptoms (Holt et al., 1999) , the effect of respiratory virus infection on lung function in asthmatics (Frey and Suki, 2008) , a DFA of airborne pollutants with climatic factors (Chen et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2009; Murdoch and Jennings, 2009) , and socioeconomic status (Shankardass et al., 2009) .",

We also found that the probability of asthma admission can be limited to below 50% by keeping the correlation exponent of influenza (\u03b1 i ) below~0.90. If the acceptable probability of exceedance were 50%, this would limit the annual asthma admission rate to 3425 per 100,000 populations or lower. We concluded that fluctuation analysis-based risk assessment provides a novel predictor for assessing the potential incidence of asthma. The risk profile of asthma admission rate converting from exceedance probability profile of influenza \u03b1 i . Inset shows the most likely (95%), likely (70%), and unlikely (30%) probabilities of asthma admission risks.",
