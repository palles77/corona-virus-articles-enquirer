            "text": "To enter cells enveloped viruses use fusion-mediating glycoproteins to facilitate the merger of the viral and host cell membranes. These glycoproteins undergo large-scale irreversible refolding during membrane fusion. The paramyxovirus parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) mediates membrane merger through its fusion protein (F). The transmembrane (TM) domains of viral fusion proteins are typically required for fusion. The TM domain of F is particularly interesting in that it is potentially unusually long; multiple calculations suggest a TM helix length between 25 and 48 residues. Oxidative crosslinking of single cysteine substitutions indicates the F TM trimer forms a helical bundle within the membrane. To assess the functional role of the PIV5 F protein TM domain, alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed. Two residues located in the outer leaflet of the bilayer are critical for fusion. Multiple amino acid substitutions at these positions indicate the physical properties of the side chain play a critical role in supporting or blocking fusion. Analysis of intermediate steps in F protein refolding indicated that the mutants were not trapped at the open stalk intermediate or the prehairpin intermediate. Incorporation of a known F protein destabilizing mutation that causes a hyperfusogenic phenotype restored fusion activity to the mutants. Further, altering the curvature of the lipid bilayer by addition of oleic acid promoted fusion of the F protein mutants. In aggregate, these data indicate that the TM domain plays a functional role in fusion beyond merely anchoring the protein in the viral envelope and that it can affect the structures and steady-state concentrations of the various conformational intermediates en route to the final postfusion state. We suggest that the unusual length of this TM helix might allow it to serve as a template for formation of or specifically stabilize the lipid stalk intermediate in fusion.",

            "text": "Membrane fusion is a fundamental biological process that occurs in intracellular trafficking, exocytosis, resealing of plasma membranes, protein trafficking, and in the entry of enveloped viruses. This ubiquitous process is mediated and tightly controlled by a combination of specific protein machinery and lipid composition 1 . Lipids spontaneously assemble into bilayer structures such as liposomes; however, lipid bilayer membranes do not spontaneously fuse 2 . The spontaneous negative or positive curvature of a lipid can enhance or diminish fusion, respectively, but energy must be expended to overcome hydration repulsion between membranes and to disrupt the bilayer structure. The energy for this remodeling may be derived from the thermal fluctuations of the membrane or from specialized fusion proteins 2 . Many biological processes, such as neuronal synaptic vesicle fusion, endosomal fusion, and exocytosis, employ the SNARE superfamily proteins 3 . SNAREs are found in all eukaryotic organisms. All SNARE proteins have a common heptad-repeat that forms four-helix coiledcoil structures, and this coiled-coil SNARE complex forms in trans to promote fusion of the two membranes in which the SNARE proteins are anchored 4 . Enveloped viruses use an analogous strategy and mediate fusion with target cells through specialized fusion proteins. The paramyxovirus parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) requires two surface glycoproteins for this process: the attachment protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) that binds sialic acid and the fusion protein (F) that physically merges the two membranes. Paramyxovirus fusion occurs at the plasma membrane and does not require the low pH of the endosome to trigger fusion 5 .",

Similar processing occurs for other class I viral fusion proteins, such as influenza virus HA, HIV gp160, retrovirus Env, Ebola GP, and SARS CoV S 5 . The paramyxovirus F precursor protein (F0) is cleaved into the membrane-anchored F1 subunit and the smaller N-terminal F2 fragment. F1 contains two hydrophobic regions, the N-terminal fusion peptide (FP), located at the new N-terminus after cleavage, and the transmembrane (TM) domain, and two heptad repeat regions, HRA and HRB. HRA is located immediately C-terminal to the FP, and HRB is proximal to the TM domain 5 .",

Recently, the crystal structures of both the uncleaved prefusion conformation of the paramyxovirus F protein and the uncleaved postfusion conformation were solved 6; 7 . The prefusion form contains a globular head containing three domains (DI-DIII) attached to a trimeric coiled-coil stalk formed by the HRB region. The HRA region in the prefusion form is composed of 11 distinct segments that wrap around the DIII core in the globular head 7 . This is in contrast to the postfusion form of F where HRA is extended into a long \u03b1-helix as part of the 6-HB. For the postfusion structure an unanticipated finding emerged as the available data indicate the F TM domain and/or cytoplasmic tail are important for the folding of F into the metastable prefusion form of F 6 : secreted F lacking a TM domain converts to the postfusion form.",

            "text": "Upon receptor binding, biochemical studies indicate HN induces a conformational change in F and the HRB three-helix stalk separates 8 . It is hypothesized that following the melting of the HRB helices and destabilization of the head (Fig. 1B) , HRA refolds to form an extended \u03b1helical coiled-coil, which enables the insertion of the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane and forms the pre-hairpin intermediate 7 (Fig 1C) . The F protein then refolds where HRB binds into the grooves between the HRA monomers and forms the six-helix bundle , bringing the FP and TM domain into juxtaposition within the same membrane 7; 9; 10; 11 ( Fig 1D) . A conceptually related final post-fusion structure is formed for all enveloped virus fusion proteins. The postfusion structure either consists of a \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structure like the 6-HB in PIV5 F or \u03b2-strand structures in other fusion proteins, like Dengue virus E, Semliki Forest virus E1, and vesicular stomatits virus (VSV) G 12 . In all cases the fusion peptide and TM domain are together in the same membrane. The formation of the 6-HB and the associated free energy change is tightly linked to the merger of the target and viral membranes 8; 13 . The collapse of the pre-hairpin intermediate distorts the bilayers to possibly form an initial pointlike protrusion 14 . Whether the insertion of the fusion peptide perturbs the lipid bilayer and lowers the distortion energy is unknown 14 . Following the initial bilayer contact, membrane merger proceeds to the lipid stalk intermediate, where the outer leaflets of each bilayer merges but the inner leaflets remain separate. This stalk then expands to form the hemifusion diaphragm. Continuation of this expansion leads to formation of the fusion pore that allows for the transfer of aqueous contents 15 .",

            "text": "In addition to aiding in protein folding and stability, the TM domains of many viral envelope fusion proteins have been shown to have a role in fusion 16; 17; 18; 19; 20; 21; 22; 23; 24 . When the TM domain of influenza virus HA was replaced with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, it resulted in a fusion protein that could mediate hemifusion by allowing the transfer of a lipid but not aqueous fluorescent probe, suggesting a role of the TM domain in pore formation and enlargement. This GPI-anchored HA was embedded only in the outer leaflet of the membrane, and it was proposed that the TM domain, which spans the entire membrane, affects the positive curvature on the inner leaflet that would allow for pore formation 17; 19 . In addition, specific residues in the TM domain have been shown to be important for fusion of influenza virus HA 18 , VSV G 20 , HIV gp41 23; 24; 25 , and baculovirus GP64 21 It has a 25-residue hydrophobic segment (spanning from 485 to 509) that is somewhat longer than the typical hydrophobic length of 20 residues for a vertically inserted TM helix. The Nterminus of the predicted TM helix is devoid of sidechains such as Trp, Tyr, Arg, or Lys that typically anchor the end of the helix in the headgroup region of the bilayer, and the sidechains of the fifteen preceding residues are uncharged and can partition easily between bilayer and aqueous phases 26; 27 . This region forms the end of the coiled-coil HRB stalk and a short linker segment in the pre-fusion form of F. Finally, the C-terminal end of the TM helix is predicted to occur at the positively charged K510, but the seven-residues following this residue are predominantly hydrophobic amino acids. Thus, if K510 snorkels into the headgroup region, the TM helix might extend beyond this point. This finding is reminiscent of the TM helix of HIV gp41 23 , which contains an absolutely conserved and functionally essential positively charged residue within the hydrophobic region of the TM helix. In summary, the TM helix of F appears to be longer than usual and has an unusually large number of potential orientations in membranes; these features piqued our interest and in part motivated the present study.",

This is particularly important question, because TM helices of fusogenic proteins often have sequences known to mediate helix-helix association, such as the GXXXG motif, and mutation of these sequences sometimes, but not always, lead to proteins that are properly expressed but have impaired function 20; 28; 29 . CryoEM studies on the human immunodeficiency virus fusion protein (Env) differ as some reports indicate the TM domains of the fusion protein are apart, like the legs of a tripod 30; 31 , whereas other studies indicate the TM domains are together and form one helical bundle 32 . By singly substituting each residue of the TM domain with cysteines, we have examined the structure of the TM domain in the lipid membrane. The addition of an oxidative cross-linker and formation of disulfide bonds clearly showed that one face of the TM helix mediates the formation of a homomeric TM helical bundle, most likely a trimer. To address the role of specific residues within the TM helix we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis, and determined that two residues, 486 and 488, are critical for PIV5 F fusion. The aggregate of analysis of the steps of fusion indicate these mutants do not support hemifusion and are trapped at the lipid stalk stage just prior to formation of the hemifusion diaphragm. Our results indicate a specific amino acid sequence of the TM domain is necessary for completion of fusion. The amino acid side chains at residues 486 and 488, which are predicted to be in the outer leaflet of the F TM domain, are critical for the merger of the two lipid membranes and fusion completion. The block in fusion observed with mutation of F residues 486 and 488 could be overcome by addition of compounds that affect the curvature of the membrane bilayer.",

Although it is thought likely that the TM domain of F would be \u03b1-helical because the hydrophobic packing of an \u03b1-helix would aid in spanning a lipid bilayer, this has not been determined. It is also unknown if the TM domains of the PIV5 F monomers interact to form a trimer. It has been shown recently that TM peptides of influenza virus HA associate with each other in model membranes 33 . In the prefusion form of F, HRB forms a three-helix bundle (3HB) and HRB is separated from the TM domain by only seven residues. Therefore, it seems likely that the F TM domain monomers would be in close proximity in the membrane if not in a 3HB. We used oxidative disulfide cross-linking to examine the structure of the F TM domain. This method has been used to investigate the arrangement of TM domains for several membrane proteins, such as the Escherichia coli chemoreceptor 34; 35; 36 , the aspartate receptor 37 , the influenza virus M2 ion channel 38 , and CD39 39; 40 .",

Furthermore, the extent of cross-linking under these conditions is similar to that observed with previously characterized membrane proteins of known three-dimensional structure, suggesting that the TM domain folds into a well-defined structure 38; 43 . One unusual feature, however, is that three consecutive residues near the outer leaflet of the bilayer (489-491) form crosslinks quite efficiently, suggesting some malleability in this region of the protein. To better determine the nature of the interface, the extent of disulfide cross-linking was quantified and fit to a sine wave. The raw CuP cross-linking data was normalized by dividing the amount of disulfide formed by the total amount of protein (disulfide linked plus not linked). The CuP data at 37\u00b0C was used for most of the TM domain, positions 492-509. Because cross-linking was stronger in the outer leaflet of the bilayer, low temperature (4\u00b0C) CuP data was used for residue positions 485-491 so that data from the two regions would be on the same scale (and to maintain linearity of the image plate response to radioactivity).

One way to allow insertion of a single residue into alpha-helices is by inserting a pi-bulge 44; 45 . Fig. 3D shows an example of a three-fold symmetric bundle created by using the backbone of a TM helix containing a pi bulge from the Na-dependent aspartate transporter structure (pdb 2nwl, 2.96 \u00c5, 46 ). The sequence of the TM region of F was threaded onto this backbone, and Gly497 was positioned within the pi-bulge. The effect of a pi-bulge on the positioning of the residues that crosslink efficiently (when mutated to Cys) can be seen by comparing it to the result expected for an ideal helix and without a pi bulge (Fig. 3D ). The pi bulge allows both the interfaces above and below the bulge to occur on the same face of the helix. A bundle was created from this helix by applying C3 symmetry followed by energy minimization (Fig. 3E) .",

As the stutters in HA result in different local distortions 48 , pre-and postfusion HA structures 49; 50 were searched for one that matched the cross-linking data as described in Supplemental Methods. Threading the sequence of the TM helix onto this backbone template gave a model in good qualitative agreement with the crosslinking data (Fig. 3F ).

Further, the entire TM domain was replaced en bloc with 25 leucine residues (Fig.  4A ). Cell surface expression of the F protein mutants TM01-TM09 was equivalent to wild type (wt) PIV5 F (Table 1) . However, mutant TM10 was not expressed at the cell surface and thus F TM10 is likely to be a malfolded protein that is not transported through the exocytic pathway to the cell surface 51 . Previously, when the TM domain of PIV5 HN was replaced with leucine residues, there was no discernable effect on the cell surface expression of HN and no effect on its biological function 52 . The ability of the F TM domain alanine scanning mutants to cause cell-cell fusion was determined by using three assays: (1) syncytia formation, (2) a luciferase reporter assay and (3) a dye transfer assay. F TM domain mutants TM03-TM09 formed similar sized syncytia as compared to wt F protein, but mutant F proteins TM01 and TM02 did not cause syncytia formation although these proteins were well expressed at the cell surface (Fig.  4B ). Whereas several of the TM mutants showed some decrease in fusion in the quantitative luciferase reporter and dye transfer assays, TM01 and TM02 caused a consistent and major reduction in fusion in all assays used ( Fig. 4C and D).",

All these mutants were expressed at the cell surface at levels similar to wt F (Table 1) . F TM domain mutants V485A, S487A, and I489A formed syncytia at levels similar to wt F, but F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A did not cause syncytia formation (Fig. 5A ). These mutants also showed a substantial decrease in fusion in the luciferase reporter and dye transfer assays (Fig. 5B, C) . In all cases where fusion occurred, both the lipidic dye, R18 (data not shown), and the aqueous content mixing dye, 6-CF, were transferred to the CV-1 cells, whereas F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A did not cause the transfer of R18 or 6-CF. Thus, these mutants do not cause either lipid mixing or contents mixing. Previously, we determined that an increase in temperature can be a surrogate for HN triggering fusion 8; 53 . To examine temperature dependent triggering of the F TM domain mutants RBCs were labeled with 6-CF and bound to effector CV-1 cells expressing HN and F proteins and labeled with SYTO-17 at 4\u00b0C. The target-effector complexes were then incubated at 29\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, or 42\u00b0C for 15 min, and the number of fusion events was measured by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5C ). For wt F, the number of dye transfer events increased with increasing temperature. The amount of fusion mediated by F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A increased between 29\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, but increasing the temperature beyond 37\u00b0C did not enhance fusion. The mutants L486A and I488A did not exhibit a hemifusion phenotype, i.e. transfer of the lipidic dye R18 to target cells in the absence of transfer of the aqueous dye 6-CF. It is possible that these mutations either stabilize the F protein and prevent F protein from attaining its lowest energy postfusion conformation or affect protein/membrane interactions that stabilize an intermediate in the fusion pathway. For example these mutant F proteins may be trapped at a folding/fusion intermediate that cannot be overcome by an increase in temperature.",

The earliest stage of fusion that has been determined was inferred from functional properties of the N-1 peptide (which is derived from the HRA region of F). N-1 peptide can bind to the HRB region of F after HN has bound to target cells at 4\u00b0C and inhibits fusion 8 . Based on the atomic structure of prefusion F this step in fusion has been called the open-stalk conformation with the HRB helices melting and breaking the interactions at the base of the head but leaving the head domain largely intact 7 . To determine if F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A can attain the F open-stalk conformation, a modified N-1 peptide, N-1-HAt, was synthesized that contains an 11 residue HA tag (YPYDVPDYASL) at the C-terminus of N-1. Peptide binding was determined by the ability of the HA tag MAb to immunoprecipitate wt F protein. It was found that the N-1-HAt bound to F at 4\u00b0C when target RBCs containing the HN receptor sialic acid were present but N-1-HAt did not bind to F as well in the absence of target RBCs. (Fig. 6A) . To test if F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A reached the open-stalk stage of fusion, N-1-HAt peptide was incubated with cells expressing HN and one of the mutant F proteins at 4\u00b0C in the presence of 0.5% hematocrit target RBCs (Fig. 6B) . The HA tag MAb 12CA5 was used to immunoprecipitate the F protein containing bound peptide, and the total F in the lysate was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody specific for F protein. N-1-HAt bound to wt F and F TM domain mutants L486A, and I488A, and the band for these mutants was generally more intense than that of the wt. This observation indicates the HRB region was accessible in all F proteins, and that the alanine substitutions in the TM domain might stabilize somewhat the formation of the openstalk conformation of F protein.",

At this stage of fusion, the C-1 peptide, derived from the HRB region of F, specifically inhibits PIV5 F-mediated fusion 54 by binding in the grooves on the outside of the HRA coiled-coil 10 . To capture the pre-hairpin conformation the C-1 peptide was used in an RBC retention assay 8 . To examine the F TM domain mutants for pre-hairpin formation, target RBCs labeled with 6-CF were bound at 4\u00b0C to CV-1 cells that co-expressed F and HN and were labeled with STYO 17. When the RBCs that have bound at 4\u00b0C to the CV-1 cell are warmed to 37\u00b0C, the majority of RBCs either fuse or are released due to the neuraminidase activity of HN that is active at 37\u00b0C but not at 4\u00b0C 8; 55 . In the presence of C-1 peptide the F protein forms the pre-hairpin intermediate and the RBCs remain bound to the CV-1 cells because the fusion peptide has inserted into the RBC membrane but further refolding is blocked and fusion is inhibited 8 . Addition of C-1 peptide did not affect the number of RBCs bound at 4\u00b0C (Fig. 6C) . However, when cells expressing F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A with bound RBCs were warmed to 37\u00b0C in the absence of C-1 peptide, there was a near complete loss of bound RBCs, suggesting that these mutants are not trapped at the prehairpin intermediate (Fig. 6C ). To determine if these mutants reached the pre-hairpin intermediate or are unable to transition between the open-stalk conformation and the prehairpin intermediate, 40 \u03bcM C-1 peptide was added. At 37\u00b0C there was an increase in the number of RBCs retained as compared to L486A and I488A at 37\u00b0C without the addition of peptide, although the number was not as large as for wt F (Fig. 6C) . These data indicate that the F TM domain mutants form the pre-hairpin intermediate, but the reproducible lower amount of C-1 binding for mutants L486A and I486A could indicate some impairment in pre-hairpin formation for these two mutants.",

Because for F S443P extensive syncytia formation occurs at room temperature in the absence of HN co-expression, F S443P and related mutants 57 have been termed hyperfusogenic. It is thought that F mutation S443P destabilizes the interactions between the top of the HRB three-helix bundle and the linker to the IgG-like Domain II 7 hence lowering the energy barrier for conversion to the open stalk conformation. Two other hyperfusogenic mutants that lower the temperature requirement for fusion and enable HNindependent fusion are Gly to Ala mutations in the fusion peptide G105A (previously referred to as G3A) and G109A (G7A) 58; 59 . Both mutations are highly destabilizing: the G109A not only destabilizes the F protein on cell surface expression but also inactivates the F protein relatively quickly and inactivates F for fusion if target cells are not present 59 .",

            "text": "It seemed possible that if F TM domain mutants are blocked in causing fusion at a stage beyond the pre-hairpin intermediate then incorporation of a hyperfusogenic mutation into the TM domain mutants might overcome the fusion block, probably due to the increased kinetics of fusion that is thought to be caused by triggering a greater number of F trimers at any one time. The L486A and I488A mutations were introduced into three hyperfusogenic backgrounds, S443P, G105A, and G109A F, to create the double mutants S443P/L486A, S443P/I488A, G105A/L486A, G105A/I488A, G109A/L486A, and G109A/I488A (Fig. 7) . The F double mutants were expressed in HeLa CD4 LTR \u03b2gal cells and cell surface abundance determined by flow cytometry. S443P/L486A, S443P/I488A, G105A/L486A and G105A/I488A were surface expressed similarly to wt F whereas the surface expression of G109A, G109A/L486A, and G109A/I488A was only 10% of wt F (Table 1) . Expression in BHK-21F cells showed that F mutants S443P/L486A, S443P/I488A, G109A/L486A, and G109A/I488A exhibited extensive syncytia formation (hyperfusogenic) and syncytia formation was independent of HN expression (data not shown). F G105A/L486A and F G105A/I488A showed higher levels of syncytia formation than F L486A and F I488A but less than F G109A protein consistent with earlier data for F mutant G105A 59 . Thus, whereas F TM mutants L486A and I488A cannot cause fusion, the addition of the hyperfusogenic mutants to create double mutants lowers the energy barrier to fusion and overcomes the block to fusion caused by the L486A and I488A mutations. These data indicate that the F TM domain mutations L486A and I488A have not caused the F proteins to convert to an inactive \"spent\" conformation and the F TM mutant proteins have not veered off the fusion pathway. It may be that increasing the number of active F molecules increases the probability of a successful fusion event -perhaps the membrane state and the number of active F molecules are parameters that interact in a manner unknown to determine a successful outcome. Alternatively, the \"lifetime\" of the prehairpin intermediate may be different between mutant and wt, and the presence of a greater number of active F molecules could enhance the probability of successful fusion. This second explanation is also consistent with the peptide-pulldown results (Fig. 6) .",

It is thought that formation of the F protein six helix bundle brings the membranes of the virus and the target cell together 8; 10 and exclusion of water molecules permits formation of the hemifusion stalk. This stalk is an initial lipid connection between the proximal membrane leaflets 60 . The stalk then expands to form the hemifusion diaphragm, which is a single bilayer segment, before the fusion pore forms 60 . Lipids can affect membrane fusion based on their molecular shape. The cone shaped lipid stearoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) has a positive spontaneous curvature, which is predicted to hinder the transition to hemifusion when present in the outer bilayer. The cone shaped lipid oleic acid (OA) has a negative spontaneous curvature, which favors hemifusion when present in the outer bilayer 61 . The addition of LPC and OA to cells expressing HN and F proteins has been shown previously to inhibit and favor an increase in fusion, respectively 8 . To examine whether addition of cone shaped lipids would overcome the block in fusion of F TM domain mutants LPC was added to CV-1 cells expressing HN and wt F, F L486A, or F I488A prior to and during binding of R18-and 6-CF-labeled RBCs at 4\u00b0C. On warming to 37\u00b0C neither lipid mixing (R18 transfer) nor cytoplasmic content mixing (6-CF transfer) occurred between the RBCs and the CV-1 effector cells (Fig. 8A ). In contrast, addition of OA to the effector cells not only increased wt F fusion, but also caused a significant increase in lipid and contents fusion for F TM mutants L486A and I488A (Fig. 8A) . Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a drug that causes positive curvature of the lipid bilayer, ruptures the hemifusion diaphragm and causes pore formation 61 . The addition of CPZ to effector cells did not cause an increase in lipid or contents fusion for F TM domain mutants L486A or I488A (Fig. 8B) ",

Therefore, further substitutions were made at F TM domain residues 486 and 488 to test how the distinct potentials of different amino acid side chains to partition into different regions of the membrane 26; 62; 63 would affect fusion activity. L486 and I488 were each substituted with I/L, V, F, C, A, G, T, W, or Y (Fig. 9) . I, L, V and F are residues that prefer to be buried deep in a bilayer, experiencing a favorable free energy of transfer from water to the bilayer center. By contrast, C, A, G, and T, show relatively flat potential profiles, indicating that transfer to the bilayer is neither strongly favored nor disfavored. Finally, W and Y have a strong tendency to localize in the headgroup region of the bilayer, relative to either the bilayer center or the aqueous phase. The fusion activity of each of the mutants expressed in Vero cells was determined using a luciferase gene reporter assay. Fusion activity was severely decreased (less than 50% of wt F) for residue 486 or 488 substitutions A, G, T, W, and Y. Substitution for C yielded \u223c60% to 80% fusion, and substitutions for I/L, V, and F showed no difference in fusion activity as compared to wt F protein (Fig. 9A) .",

The E(z) potential was used to test further how the substitutions would affect the propensity of the TM sequence to insert into a bilayer 26 . This potential, which is based on a statistical analysis of the crystallographic database of 153 membrane proteins 65 , defines the potential for a given residue to reside at various depths in the membrane, and it is useful for determining which regions of a TM domain have the greatest preference to reside in specific regions of the bilayer. Fig. 9B shows a plot of the E(z) potential scores generated by computing the mean score for successive 20-residue segments across the sequence. The results are plotted for the average, and for segments with scores plus or minus a single standard deviation from the mean. In each case the sequences funnel down to a relatively sharp minimum. Because each point reflects the score for a 20-residue sequence, the minimum identifies the 20-residue segment with the highest propensity to lie vertical to the bilayer surface. This figure also compares the profiles of the F protein with that for the other two integral membrane proteins of the paramyxovirus PIV5 (SH and HN) 66; 67 , and the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus 68 , the latter which contains both a TM helix as well as a C-terminal cytoplasmic helical segment (Fig. 9C) . The sequences of SH, HN, and M2 funnel in the usual manner, and 20-30 residue stretches are observed with a high propensity to span the bilayer. Interestingly, however, the F protein sequence shows an unusually broad minimum, indicative of a much more extended sequence with some propensity to lie within the bilayer. This property is conserved among the paramyxovirus F proteins tested (measles virus, mumps virus, Newcastle disease virus and human parainfluenza viruses 2 and 3) although the profile for PIV5 is the broadest (Supplemental Fig. 3 ). For PIV5 F the absolute minimum in the curve suggests the TM helix begins at residue 485 in good agreement with the air-oxidation cross-linking data, showing this to be near the headgroup region. However, with a very small energetic cost, the native TM helical bundle could translocate up or down through the membrane, or lie at an oblique angle.",

Fig. 9D illustrates the effects of the mutations on the cumulative E(z) potential score for the N-terminal region for the mutations at residues 486 and 488. To help visualize the effects, the graphs were computed for double-mutants, but the same trends hold for the individual mutants. The mutations change the 20 residue window of the protein with the most membrane favorable sequence. Instead of the 20 residue window 485-504 being the most membrane favorable, the best window becomes 493-512. Additionally, with the exception of Trp, all the mutations have the effect of moving the most membrane suitable 20 residue window from 485-504 in the wild type to 493-512 in the mutants. Clearly other regions of the protein are important for determining the boundary of the TM helix so it is difficult to interpret this as a literal movement of the TM in the resting state. Nevertheless, if helical movements are important for the fusion mechanism, these changes would upset the energetics of fusion.

The canonical TM is shown in green, while the N-terminal (blue) and C-terminal (red) regions that are more suitable for the membrane than one standard deviation above the mean are also shown.

            "text": "To study the features of the paramyxovirus PIV5 F protein TM domain for membrane fusion activity alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used. The F protein TM domain was found to exhibit sequence dependence for fusion activity and it was also observed that a block of 20 leucine residues could not substitute for the entire PIV5 F TM domain even to obtain cell surface expression of F. Upon further substitution, residues L486 and I488 were found to play a key role in fusion, where altering the hydrophobicity of the side chain at these residues profoundly affected fusion activity (Fig. 9A) . Although F mutants L486A and I488A were deficient for fusion, biological activity could be rescued by the addition of the destabilizing mutations F S443P, F G105A, or F G109A (Fig. 7) , indicating F L486A and I488A were not trapped in an intermediate conformation nor had the mutant F proteins veered irreversibly off the fusion pathway. It is generally thought that F-mediated membrane fusion requires the action of several trimers and the hyperfusion phenotype of destabilizing mutants may be due to more synchronous F activation events in an otherwise stochastic process. Thus, addition of a destabilizing mutation to F proteins that are blocked for fusion may simply alter the lifetimes of conformational intermediates, driving the fusion process by mass action. Detailed analysis indicated F L486A and F I488A form the prefusion conformation of F, the open-stalk intermediate, the pre-hairpin intermediate, and F can be converted to a conformation that is close to, or at the post-fusion form ( Fig. 1 A-D) . As discussed above the precise timing of the conversion of the prehairpin conformation to the postfusion form with the formation of the lipid intermediates is not known, but refolding of F may occur across all the lipid intermediate stages. Evidence from studies of HIV gp120/gp41 suggest some 6HB formation occurs after a pore has formed 13; 73 Thus, it seemed likely that the block in fusion for the F L486A and F I488A proteins corresponds to their inability to complete the lipidic stages of fusion (Fig. 1C-D) . The data obtained using OA to confer negative spontaneous curvature of the membrane and concomitantly causing a large increase in fusion activity of F L486A and F I488A indicates that fusion is delayed/arrested at the lipid stalk intermediate (Fig. 1 panels f-i) . These findings suggest that the TM domain might play an active role in the lipidic steps in fusion, as discussed previously 16; 17; 18; 19 . In fusion, the formation of the 6HB and the postfusion form of F brings together the TM domain and the FP, which excludes water between the membranes, and this local dehydration allows for membrane contact 2 . There is a high-energy requirement for the presumptive next stage, the lipid stalk 74 .",

            "text": "One goal of this work was to define the structural features of the TM domain and to relate these to potential roles in the mechanism of fusion. The available atomic structures of ion channel proteins indicate that the multiple TM domains are mostly \u03b1-helical 69 and for the very few known viral proteins, the structures of the TM domains of integral membrane proteins are \u03b1helical 71;72;75 . Even less is known as to whether the TM \u03b1-helices are together in the membrane forming helical bundles or whether each \u03b1-helix is separate from the others. Clearly for the influenza virus M2 ion channel the TM domains form a four-helix bundle 71; 72 . CryoEM studies on the human immunodeficiency virus fusion protein (Env) differ as some reports indicate the TM domains of the fusion protein are apart, like the legs of a tripod 30; 31 , whereas other studies indicate the TM domains are together and form one helical bundle 32 . The substitution of F TM domain residues with cysteine and cross-linking induced by air oxidation confirmed the N-terminal boundary of the TM in the membrane, and treatment with CuP indicates the TM domains in the F trimer form a TM helical bundle. Further, the extensive cross-linking of residues in the outer leaflet of the bilayer suggests that in this region the helices have significant flexibility or are only partially folded, thereby allowing three consecutive residues to become very highly cross-linked (Fig. 3B) . Quantification of the extent of disulfide bond formation and modeling studies indicate that the data fit best a model in which the F TM domain forms a 3HB within the membrane. A break in the regular 7-residue period seen for coiled coils, suggest that a residue was inserted near the center of the bilayer resulting in either a pi bulge at residues 497-500 (Fig. 3D ,E) or a \"stutter\" geometry ( Fig 3F) . The PIV5 TM domain contains glycine at residues 494 and 497, but they do not appear to be essential to function or to mediate tight inter-helical interactions. Residue L486 is predicted to be at the interface of the 3HB although the fusion data (in the presence of oleic acid) indicate this residue is likely to interact with the lipids of the bilayer. Presumably, the structural malleability that enables the residues close to the ectodomain to form disulfide bonds also enables residue L486 to populate different conformations that either face the interior of the predicted 3HB or interact with the lipid bilayer.",

The length would allow the helix to move dynamically into different orientations and/or lie at extreme angles in the membrane. In this work, the extra-viral end of the TM helix in the resting state was inferred from the Cys cross-linking as well as the E(z) potential, which were in good agreement. However, if this were the only orientation sampled by the helix during fusion then mutation of residue I488 to Trp should not negatively impact function because it would be on the exposed face of the 3HB located in the headgroup region, where Trp is quite stabilizing. If, however, dynamic changes in the orientation within the bilayer were required, then this anchoring substituent would upset the energetic balance between the states adopted along the reaction coordinate. Given that the mutants appear to be defective in lipid stalk formation, and that the TM helix has a hydrophobic region both preceding and following it, we consider it possible that the TM region might act as a template to stabilize the lipid stalk intermediate. The N-terminal hydrophobic extension would encourage the diffusion of lipids out of the outer leaflet of the bilayer and along the stalk-like template, and initiating the formation of the lipid stalk (Fig. 10) . Decreasing the hydrophobicity of the protein by mutating I488 or L486 to less polar residues, or stabilizing the initial configuration by inclusion of Trp and Tyr would increase the energetic cost of translocation of the helix through the membrane and migration of lipids up the stalk.",

Our calculations and experimental results suggest that the energy of the system is finely balanced, allowing this translocation to occur at minimal energetic cost. In the resting state, the TM bundle is stably inserted in the bilayer, but vertical translocations within the bilayer should occur at a relatively small energetic cost due to the lack of N-terminal anchoring residues and the hydrophobicity of the residues on both sides of the TM helix. Importantly, hairpin formation might provide a strong driving force for translocation of the TM helices in the bilayer. This conformational transition has the net affect of pulling the FP and the TM helix (located in opposing bilayers) towards one another, effectively applying a mechanical force favoring translocation of the N-terminus of the TM helix out of the bilayer, and the C-terminus of the TM helix deeper into the bilayer. The concomitant increase in length of the hydrophobic N-terminal extra-cellular region would provide a greater surface to serve as a template for non-bilayer lipidic intermediates. Finally, we note that in the pre-hairpin intermediate the 3HB of HRA has a very hydrophobic surface prior to docking of the HRB helix and formation of the water-soluble post-fusion six-helix bundle. Thus, the 3HB of HRA could serve a similar role to encourage the initiation of a lipidcoated stalk projecting from the target cell's membrane.",

Additionally, Dengue E protein (a class II fusion protein) has two TM helices, one of which has a long membrane suitable region that has an E(z) score one deviation from the average of 153 TM domains (Supplemental Fig. 4A ). VSV (class III) has a single TM helix that that also has a long membrane suitable region (Supplemental Fig. 4B ).

Because cross-linking is stronger towards the outside of the membrane and saturation can occur on the image plates of the Fuji Image Analyzer (Valhalla, NY), two sets of cross-linking data were combined for the analysis. First, cross-linking data using CuP at 37\u00b0C was used for most of the transmembrane positions, residues 492-509. To put the residues that are in the outer leaflet on the same scale, low temperature (4\u00b0C) CuP data was used for residue positions 485-491. Given the normalized data, a sine wave was fit according to the following formula: where x is the residue number, y is the normalized degree of cross-linking, a is the amplitude of the sine wave, b is the phase offset, c is the \u03b1-helical periodicity, and d is the y offset of the sine wave. Values were fit by non-linear regression.

Vero cells were cotransfected to express HN, and wt F or mutant F proteins, and a luciferase reporter construct. At 16 h p.t. BSR T7/5 cells were overlaid on the Vero cells, and 6 h post overlay, the luciferase activity of each sample was read. Dashed line indicates 50% of wt F fusion. Shown is the average of three experiments each done in triplicate and normalized to wt F. The next three panels show sequence suitability of protein sequences in the membrane quantified by the E(z) scale. (B) The mean (solid line) and one standard deviation above and below the average (dashed line) E(z) score for 153 transmembrane helices of known structure containing a minimum of 20 residues 65 . 20 residue sliding windows were used for each helix sequence, with the residues renumbered such that the lowest scoring (most membrane suitable) window occurs at residue number 0. The results for all 153 proteins were averaged after the renumbering. (C) E(z) results for four viral transmembrane proteins: PIV5 F, PIV5 HN, PIV5 SH, and influenza (flu) A M2. Horizontal lines show the mean (solid) and one standard deviation above and below (dashed) values for the 153 transmembrane helices in (A) . (D) E(z) results for four double mutants of PIV5 F. Residue positions L486 and I488 were mutated to alanine (A), threonine (T), tryptophan (W), and tyrosine (Y). Windows that do not include either mutation are shown in thick black (common region). (E) Atomistic model of the proposed extended transmembrane region of PIV5 F. The canonical TM is shown in green, while the N-terminal (blue) and C-terminal (red) regions that are more suitable for the membrane than one standard deviation above the mean are also shown. This region is expected to be more suitable for the membrane than any window in 24 of the 153 TM domain sequences. ",

(C) After formation of the open-stalk conformation, HRA rearranges to form the extended \u03b1-helical bundle, and the FP is inserted into the target cell membrane (the pre-hairpin intermediate).
