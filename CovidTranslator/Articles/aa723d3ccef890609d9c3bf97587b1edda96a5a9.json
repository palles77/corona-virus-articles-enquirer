However, no single virus has been demonstrated as the etiologic agent. Multiple different infections may be involved, first in priming the immune system for autoimmunity and then in triggering the actual disease. A model based on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis, has been developed, which shows that an initial early infection with a virus having molecular mimicry to self-epitopes can prime for disease that occurs after a subsequent non-specific immunologic stimulus, such as a different infection. The role of multiple infections in the development of autoimmune disease may explain why no one virus has been implicated.",

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain virus triggers of autoimmune disease. One mechanism is molecular mimicry, whereby the immune response to the virus cross-reacts with self, resulting in autoimmunity (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Another is epitope spreading, in which an initial immune response to a single epitope of a selfprotein progresses to an immune response to other self-epitopes of the same protein (intramolecular spreading) and then to other self proteins (intermolecular spreading) (8-l 1). A related mechanism is bystander activation, whereby virus infection causes infhunmation and tissue damage in the surrounding area, thus releasing host antigens, which together with induced immune host factors initiate autoimmunity (12,13). It has been proposed that multiple virus infections may be required for the development of autoimmunity. The initial infection may prime the immune system, while a subsequent infection with the same or antigenically related virus may trigger the autoimmune reaction (14).",

It is an autoimmune disease of the CNS characterized by inflammatory demyelinating lesions that coalesce into large plaque-like regions within white matter (24).

On the other hand, exacerbations of MS have been correlated with viral infections (30) (31) (32) (33) . Several animal models of MS are based on viral infections; for example, canine distemper virus infection of dogs, visna virus infection of sheep, and murine coronavirus and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of mice (11, 29, (34) (35) (36) (37) .

The initial infection primes the immune system, while a subsequent infection or other non-specific immunologic stimulus can trigger the disease. The mice used are 3to Qweek-old (mimicking pre-puberty) female SJUJ mice, which are genetically susceptible to EAE. In our model, we use one of two different methods for the initial priming infection. The first is the injection of plasmid cDNA encoding ubiquitin fused to PLP. The second is infection with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding CNS proteins. These agents approximate what could occur during virus infection when virus proteins, having molecular mimicry with self-CNS proteins, are synthesized within the cytoplasm of infected cells. Tbe subsequent infection or non-specific immunologic stimulus for the first priming method was either phosphate buffered saline (PBS) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding p galactosidase. PLP,39-,s, emulsified in CFA was used as a positive control and PBS alone as a negative control. The subsequent non-specific immunologic challenge for the second priming method was CFA, either with or without whole Bordetella pertussis organisms, Mice primed with the cDNA plaamid and triggered with CFA developed clinical and pathological signs of EAE, similar to that seen in the control group primed with cDNA plasmid and triggered with PLP,,,,,, (positive control). Mice primed with the cDNA plasmid and triggered with the recombinant vaccinia virus encoding P_galactosidase developed pathological signs of EAE without any clinical signs. Also, mice primed with the recombinant vaccinia virus encoding CNS proteins and challenged with CFA plus B. pertussis developed pathological lesions of EAE; however, no clinical signs were evident. The presence of pathological lesions in the absence of clinical symptoms has also been observed in MS in humans. Through the use of magnetic resonance imaging, disease activity in the form of pathological lesions has been observed to be 5 to 10 times higher than the disease activity recognized by clinical evaluation (39) (40) (41) .",

A working definition of C. d#icile-associated disease (CDAD) includes (i) diarrhea, defined as at least six watery stools over 36 h, three unformed stools in 24 h for 2 days, or eight unformed stools over 48 h; (ii) pseudomembranes seen at endoscopy of the lower gastrointestinal tract or detection of toxins or toxigenic organisms in stool; (iii) no other recog-nized etiology for diarrhea; and (iv) a history of treatment with antimicrobial or antineoplastic agents within the previous 8 weeks or a response to specific therapy for CDAD (2). Many antimicrobial and antineoplastic agents have been demonstrated to induce CDAD, but the most common are the antimicrobial agents clindamycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, and the cephalosporins (3).Diagnosis of CDAD is important because the disease can be severe and it is a major nosocomial problem. A variety of methods are currently available for the laboratory diagnosis of CDAD,",
