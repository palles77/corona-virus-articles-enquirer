CotB is a protein in the B. subtilis spore coat. In this system, three repeats of the immunodominant ovalbumin T-cell epitope (OVA 323-339 ) were linked with the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) to construct a fusion protein, CTB-OVA epi, which was then fused to the C-terminal of the CotB protein so that CTB-OVA epi was expressed in vegetatively-growing B. subtilis. The expression and localization of the CTB-OVA epi protein was confirmed by western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry. The results indicated that a CotB-based surface display system was successfully used to express the CTB-OVA epi protein on the surface of vegetative B. subtilis cells.",

More recently, vaccine delivery systems have been developed using the surface display of foreign antigens on live bacterial surfaces, and these are able to provide better levels of immunity against pathogens (Hansson et al. 2001) . When a heterogeneous immunogen is expressed on the surface of non-pathogenic bacteria and then orally administered alive, long-lasting immune responses can be elicited (Hansson et al. 2001) . The surface structures of the bacteria that act as adjuvants might explain the strong antigenicity of the surface-expressed foreign protein (Hansson et al. 2001) .",

            "text": "In Gram-negative bacteria, heterologous surface display has been widely used and is now becoming a promising research area. E. coli plays a major role as an expression host that can display heterologous proteins on the cell surface (Jose et al. 2002; Narita et al. 2006) . However, there have been few reports on the use of heterologous surface display on Gram-negative bacteria for the purpose of producing edible vaccine vehicles. Compared with Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria are more rigid because they have a much thicker cell wall. Grampositive bacteria also lack an outer membrane so the secretion of heterologous proteins is correspondingly simple . Therefore, Gram-positive bacteria are considered as good candidates for the development of recombinant live vaccines using a surface display expression system. Furthermore, some Gram-positive bacteria are non-pathogenic or food-grade, and can thus safely be used to generate live bacterial vaccines. For instance, Streptococcus gordonii has been employed to display the tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFC) on the surface of bacteria . Lactobacillus has also been employed to express the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus spike protein and human papillomavirus antigen proteins on the surface of bacteria for the production of edible vaccines Poo et al. 2006) . In this study, we were interested in developing a cell surface display system based on B. subtilis since it offers several of the advantages mentioned above. In addition, B. subtilis is closely related to an edible bacterium, Bacillus subtilis (natto). CotB has already been employed as an anchoring protein to display the tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFC) of Clostridium tetani on the surface of B. subtilis spores (Isticato et al. 2001 ). However, little is known about whether the heterologous protein can be expressed on the surface of vegetative cells of B. subtilis. Therefore, we planned to use B. subtilis as a tool for the production of live recombinant bacteria via the display of a fusion antigen protein on its vegetative cell surface.",

The cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) was employed as a fusion partner because it is a nontoxic and very useful adjuvant and carrier for enhancing the induction of mucosal antibody responses to the linked antigen (Lebens and Holmgren 1994) .

In this study, to achieve a high level of protein expression, MWP promoters derived from Bacillus brevis 47 were employed. The consensus RBS sequence (AAAGGAGG) was determined by searching the whole genome sequence of B. subtilis (Ohashi et al. 2003) . This sequence was based on experimental data showing that the optimal RBS was AAAGGAGG and the optimal distance between the RBS and start codon was 7-9 nucleotides (Ohashi et al. 2003) . The forward primer MWP-Fw and the reverse primer MWP-RBS-Rv, which is complementary to the 3 0 end sequence of the MWP promoters, were used to amplify the PCR product mwp-RBS from the genome of Bacillus brevis. Using the mwp-RBS fusion gene as the template, the 5 0 end sequence of the cotB gene was linked to the 3 0 end of mwp-RBS using the overlap extension PCR method. The forward primer MWP-Fw and the reverse primer MWP-RBS-cotB-Rv, which is complementary to the 5 0 end sequence of the cotB gene and the 3 0 end sequence of the MWP promoters, were used to amplify the PCR product, namely the mwp-RBS-cotB fusion gene (containing 15 bp of the 5 0 end sequence of cotB).

            "text": "We report here the use of a novel, CotB-based surface display system to express the CTB-OVA epi antigen protein on the surface of vegetative cells of B. subtilis. It has previously been reported that at least 20 polypeptides are organized to form the two layers of the B. subtilis spore coat (Driks 1999; Henriques and Moran 2000) . Some of these polypeptides have been associated with the outer part of the coat, but for all of them the exact location within the coat and the protein domain required for surface exposure are not known (Zheng et al. 1988 ). However, the proteinaceous nature of this multilayered coat suggests the possibility of using its structural components as fusion partners for the expression of heterologous proteins on the spore surface (Isticato et al. 2001 ). The CotB protein was used as an anchoring motif to express the tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFC) of Clostridium tetani on the surface of B. subtilis spores (Isticato et al. 2001 ) by integrating the cotB gene (1) B. subtilis 168 cells harboring the pHY300-ctb-ova epi plasmid were grown at 37\u00b0C for 8 h in LB medium (negative control). (2-4) B. subtilis 168 cells harboring the pHY300-cotB-ctb-ova epi plasmid were grown at 37\u00b0C for 8 h in LB medium. Cells were labeled with the primary rabbit anti-CT antibody, followed by the secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with FITC. Bright-field images (a) and the corresponding fluorescence (b) micrographs are shown (91,500) Fig. 5 Flow cytometric analysis of B. subtilis harboring the pHY300ctb-ova epi and pHY300-cotB-ctb-ova epi plasmids. Transformants were grown at 37\u00b0C for 8 h in LB medium containing 10 lg/ml of tetracycline. Cells were labeled with the primary rabbit anti-CT antibody, followed by the secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with FITC. A total of 50,000 cells were analyzed in each experiment and TTFC gene into the B. subtilis genome. The TTFC was successfully displayed on the surface of B. subtilis spores by the CotB coat protein, which was expressed in the outer layer of the B. subtilis spore coat (Isticato et al. 2001 ). However, the procedure of gene integration was complex and time-consuming and the incubation period for sporulation usually required 24 h. In addition, the spores also needed to be washed and purified (Isticato et al. 2001) . In this study, we hypothesized that CotB could be employed as an anchoring motif to display the antigen protein on the surface of vegetative cells of B. subtilis directly, thus simplifying the procedure for protein expression. B. subtilis is non-pathogenic, and is closely related to an edible bacterium, Bacillus subtilis (natto), which is used to produce fermented soybean ''natto'' (Itaya and Matsui 1999; Qiu et al. 2004 ). Therefore, the potential for development of vaccine delivery systems using B. subtilis is significant and promising.",

            "text": "In this study, we constructed a recombinant expression vector based on the pHY300 vector by inserting the cotB and CTB-OVA epi genes into this plasmid. The expression of the antigen proteins was only induced after the recombinant B. subtilis strains were grown in LB medium at 37\u00b0C for 8 h, without requiring other induction factors. This procedure simplified the preparation of the surface displayed bacterial vaccine to a great extent. However, the expressed CTB-OVA epi antigen protein on the cell surface of B. subtilis was degraded over time, probably due to proteases produced by B. subtilis. The amount of CTB-OVA epi protein expressed by this surface display system was not particularly high, according to the difference in fluorescence intensity between cells displaying CTB-OVA epi and the negative control. However, this functional CotB-based surface display system for the vegetative cells of B. subtilis is not only able to provide better levels of immunity against pathogens than the ordinary system but also establishes a good foundation for using B. subtilis (natto) as a organism for the future production of edible vaccine vehicles. Here we have described the expression of an antigen protein from a gene in the genome of B. subtilis. In future experiments, the CotB-CTB-OVA epi gene will be integrated into the genome of B. subtilis for the stability of the antigen gene. Further work to increase the yield and examine the immunity of the displayed protein on the surface of B. subtilis cells is still required.",
