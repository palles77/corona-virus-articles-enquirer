Acta vet. scand. 2001, 42, 113-121. -The present report describes the clinical, pathological, serological and virological findings in calves from 2 larger Danish beef herds experiencing outbreaks of pneumonia. The calves had been vaccinated with an inactivated bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) vaccine 2 months prior to the outbreak. The clinical signs comprised nasal discharge, pyrexia, cough and increased respiratory rates. A total of 28 calves died in the 2 herds. The laboratory investigations revealed that BRSV was involved and probably initiated both outbreaks. Furthermore, the serological results suggested that the vaccine induced only sparse levels of antibodies probably due to the presence of maternally derived antibodies at the time of vaccination. Necropsy findings in 5 calves revealed changes typical for infectious pneumonia with involvment of BRSV. In conclusion, vaccination of calves against BRSV in 2 Danish beef herds failed to protect the calves against severe or even fatal BRSV mediated respiratory disease 2 months later.",

            "text": "Respiratory disease is one of the most important health problems in young Danish cattle with substantial financial losses for the industry (Tegtmeier et al. 1999 , Uttenthal et al. 1996 . Thus, approximately 20% of the materials from bovines submitted to The Danish Veterinary Laboratory (DVL) for necrosy originate from cattle with a history of respiratory symptoms. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) has been recognised in recent years as the major viral component of the bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex (Larsen 2000) . This is based on the high prevalence of seropositive individuals (Uttenthal et al. 2000 , Uttenthal et al. 1996 and the strong correlation between respiratory disease and detection of the virus in diagnostic samples (Larsen et al. 1999 ). BRSV has a predilection for the lower respiratory tract and may damage the respiratory tract epithelium directly followed by changes induced by, i.e. inflammatory mediators (Kimman et al. 1989a ) and/or it may increase the ability of bacteria to invade the lung and cause a secondary bacterial infection (Babiuk et al. 1988) . So far it has not been possible to prove a clear link between protection and level of actively produced or passively acquired antibodies in natural BRSV infection. Thus, calves less that 6 months are most frequently infected with BRSV despite the presence of maternally derived antibodies. Furthermore, reinfections occur even in sero-positive calves (Van der Poel et al. 1993) . Antibodies may be partly protective, however, since the incidence and severity of disease seems to be inversely related to the level of specific maternal antibodies (Kimman et al. 1988) . Several inac-tivated and modified live BRSV vaccines are commercially available in North-America and Europe, yet none have been registered for use in Denmark (September, 2000) . In 1997 approximately 20 Danish beef herds, with confirmed BRSV positive status, received a temporary permission to use an inactivated vaccine against BRSV in calves. The present report describes the clinical, pathological, serological and virological findings in vaccinated calves in 2 Danish beef herds experiencing outbreaks of pneumonia in January 1998.",

Similarly, the presence of BRSV antigen in 2 of the necropsied calves, and the serological responses suggested that this was also true for the outbreak in herd B. Previous studies on the pathogenesis of BRSV infection have shown that BRSV antigen may be detected in nasal swabs material from days 2-3 until days 8-10 post infection (Larsen et al. 1999 , Vilcek et al. 1994 . Studies on the kinetics of BRSV specific antibody isotypes in serum have revealed that IgM and IgA may be present from day 8-10 until days 14-25 (Kimman et al. 1988 ). IgG1 being detectable from days 10-17, peaking on days 24-38 and remaining detectable for up to 8 months (half-life 21-32 days) (Schrijver et al. 1996 , Kimman et al. 1988 ). The IgG2 isotype did not appear in serum until days 25-86, peaking on days 38-90 and lasting for at least 9 months. Thus, the detection of antigen in the nasal cavity and the lack of IgM and IgA at the first sampling in herd A indicated these samples were taken shortly after infection, i.e. prior to day 8-10. Contrary to the situation in herd A, the lack of antigen in nasal swabs and the presence of IgM and IgA in herd B indicated that the first samples were taken later than 8-12 days after infection. At this time detectable amounts of IgG1 and SNT antibodies may have been produced in response to the active infection, especially in vaccinated calves (see below). The relatively high titers of IgG1 and SNT encountered in herd B at the first sampling do not necessarily represent antibodies induced by the vaccine. Similarly, the low IgG1 and SNT titers at the first sampling in herd A may represent either residues of maternal derived antibodies or antibodies induced by the vaccine.",

The failure of the vaccine to induce higher titers of antibodies may be due to either poor immunigenicity or the presence of moderate or high levels of maternally derived antibodies at the time of vaccination. Thus, presence of maternally or naturally acquired antibodies have been shown to suppress both the local and systemic antibody responses following experimental BRSV infection (Ciszewski et al. 1991 , Kimman et al. 1987 . Interestingly, these studies also revealed that a memory response might be mounted even in the absence of a detectable primary response in seropositive calves. Therefore, vaccinated calves may display a stronger and more rapid systemic antibody response at challenge. Indeed, the high IgG1, IgG2 and SNT titers in the second sample in both herds were in surplus of the titers normally seen in naturally infected calves (Uttenthal et al. 2000) .",

Kimman and co-workers investigated the effect of routes of administration and maternal antibodies on the protective effect of modified live and inactivated vaccines (Kimman et al. 1989c were isolated from one or more of the 5 lungs, in addition to the BRSV antigen detected in 2 cases. These findings were in accordance with previous microbiological studies on pneumonic calf lung tissue, where multiple pathogens frequently were isolated (Tegtmeier et al. 1999) . The presence of one or more of the isolated microorganisms may likely have contributed to the development and severity of pneumonia. However, viral agents, such as BRSV, are usually considered the primary pulmonary pathogen, capable of destroying the respiratory epithelial lining to a degree allowing other agents to colonize (Babiuk et al. 1988 ). In a former study (Tegtmeier et al. 1999) , performed on pneumonic lung tissue submitted to the DVL for diagnostic purposes, BRSV antigen was often detected in cases of suppurative bronchopneumonias, in which syncytial cells and interstitial emphysema could be observed. Syncytial cells and interstitial emphysema were features present in all 5 cases necropsied in the present study, thereby indicating that BRSV was, or had been, present in the examined lungs. The significant rise in BCV specific antibodies in 3 out of 5 calves in herd B and the presence of high titers of BCV antibodies in most of the other sampled calves in both herds confirm previous findings, that BCV is common in Danish cattle (Larsen et al. 1999) . However, the association between the presence of BCV and BCV antibodies and outbreak of respiratory disease is still controversial (Martin et al. 1998 ). Experimental infections with BCV failed to induce fulminate respiratory disease (Heckert et al. 1991) , but the detection of BCV in nasal swabs and specific rise in BCV titers were strongly correlated to outbreaks of respiratory disease in a large survey recently performed in 20 Danish dairy herds (Alban et al. 1999) . Thus, presently BCV may be considered involved in the BRD complex, but the virus is probably not capable of inducing fulminate res-piratory disease without the presence of other contributing factors. Interpretation of BCV serological and virological data is further complicated by the fact that the diagnostic assays employed did not distinguish between BCV strains involved in BRD and strains involved in enteric infections.",
