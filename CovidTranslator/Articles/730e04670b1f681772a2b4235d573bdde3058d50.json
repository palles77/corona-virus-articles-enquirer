            "text": "We have investigated the role of two polymorphic sites (R190W and N192K) on the binding and activation of the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) by viral and formyl peptides. WEDWVGWI, a peptide with antiviral activity derived from the membrane proximal region of feline immunodeficiency virus, binds with high affinity to FPR. The three tryptophans in the peptide are all essential for FPR binding, just as they were essential for antiviral activity (Giannecchini, S. et al., J. Virol. 77 (2003) 3724). Formyl-NleWEDWVGWI behaved as a weak partial agonist with FPR W190/N192 but a stronger partial agonist with FPR R190/K192 and FPR R190/N192. Formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI behaved as a full agonist toward all three FPRs but exhibited a much higher EC 50 with W190/N192 FPR (300\u00b145 nM) than for R190/K192 FPR (40\u00b13 nM) or R190/N192 (60 \u00b18 nM). Formyl-MYKWPWYVWL preferentially activated R190/K192 and R190/N192 FPRs by >5 fold compared to W190/N192 FPR. Formyl-MFEDAVAWF, a peptide derived from a protein in Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis and formyl-MFTFEPFPTN, a peptide derived from the N-terminus of chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus with an added N-terminal methionine exhibited the greatest selectivity for R190/K192 and R190/N192 FPRs with ~10 fold lower EC 50S than that observed with FPR W190/N192. Thus, individuals with the W190 polymorphism may display a reduced ability to detect certain formyl peptides.",

            "text": "Neutrophils play an essential role in innate immunity. In addition to activating phagocytosis and secreting superoxides and hydrolytic enzymes, the neutrophil must be able to chemotax, or migrate toward the source of a chemoattractant [1, 2] . The formyl peptide receptor (FPR) is a chemoattractant G protein-coupled receptor found on the surface of phagocytes and it is thought to play an important role in allowing phagocytic cells to recognize the presence of bacteria [3] and damaged cells, since only eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts initiate their protein synthesis with formyl-methionine [4] . FPR expressing cells also exhibit chemotaxis toward peptides derived from the GP-41 envelope protein of HIV-1 [5, 6] . A peptide derived from herpes simplex virus type 2 elicited chemotaxis and superoxide production in neutrophils in a process that appeared to involve FPR [7] . In addition, we recently observed that peptides from the proximal membrane region of the fusion proteins of human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, coronaviruses 229E and HKU, and Ebola virus were potent inhibitors of FPR [8] . Thus FPR appears to respond to the presence of virally derived peptides in addition to bacterially derived ones (For a review of ligands affecting FPR see [9] ). Two proteins secreted by S. aureus are inhibitors of FPR ( [10] [11] [12] ). Chemotaxis inhibitory factor of S. aureus (CHIPS) inhibits FPR and the C5a receptor and a homologue of CHIPS, FPRL1 inhibitory protein (FLIPr) inhibits FPRL1 and to a lesser extent FPR, but not C5a. The N-terminus of CHIPS is essential for binding to FPR since removal of the n-terminal phenylalanine reduces affinity for FPR ~1000 fold. Peptides derived from the N-terminus are also inhibitors of FPR but with ~10,000 fold lower affinity than CHIPS.",

Numerous studies have indicated that patients with aggressive periodontitis exhibit a ~2 fold reduction in chemotaxis toward fMLF [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] indicating that a reduced ability to exhibit chemotaxis toward formyl peptides may be associated with this disease.

We identified several formyl peptides that exhibit high selectivity for activation of R190/K192 and R190/N192 compared with W190/N192.

            "text": "Since downregulation is a hallmark of receptor activation [33] and the trafficking of FPR expressed in CHO cells to endocytotic vesicles following treatment with fMLF has been thoroughly investigated [34] , we chose this assay as a highly precise way to evaluate ligand activation of receptor. Figure 2A shows a time course of loss of surface receptor for the three FPR variants following treatment with 3 \u03bcM formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe. All exhibited t \u00bd of ~ 5-6 min but W190/N192 downregulated to a lesser maximum extent. Figure 2B shows recovery of surface receptor after treatment with formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe for 1 hr. All three variants exhibited partial recovery of surface receptor after downregulation with slightly higher recovery observed with W190/N192. We then determined the peptides concentration dependent downregulation surface expression of the receptor to assess whether the peptides exhibited agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist activity. As we observed for other viral peptides [8] , WEDWVGWI did not cause any down regulation at concentrations up to 25\u03bcM, but 25\u03bcM WEDWVGWI inhibited the downregulation with 300 nM formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe by 5 0% in all three FPRs (data not shown). However, formyl-NleWEDWVGWI behaved as a partial agonist (figure 2B) when compared with formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe (figure 3A). Only weak partial agonist activity was observed with W190/N192 (34\u00b13%, P<0.0001 vs either R190/K192 or R190/N192), and greater partial agonist activity was observed with R190/K192 (55\u00b12%) and R190/N192 (58\u00b14%). W190/N192 also exhibited a higher EC 50 for downregulation than R190/K192 or R190/N192 but the difference was not significant. Formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI behaved as a full agonist for all three FPRs (figure 4A), but the EC 50 for W190/N192 (300\u00b140 nM, P<0.0001 vs either R190/K192 or R190/N192) was 5-7 fold higher than either R190/K192 (40\u00b13 nM) or R190/N192 (60\u00b18 nM) despite the observation that the K i s differed by only two fold. The observed EC 50 s were more than 10 fold below the respective K i s for R190/K192 and R190/N192 and 3 fold below the K i of W190/R190, implying that formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI was 3 times more effective in activating R190/ K192 and R190/N192 than W190/N192. This large difference in EC 50 vs K i is in marked contrast to what we observe with formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe (figure 3A) where the EC 50 s are similar to the K i s we previously reported [8] ; EC 50 =175\u00b120 vs K i =160\u00b125 for W190/N192; EC 50 =75 \u00b15 vs K i =62\u00b18 for R190/K192; EC 50 =50\u00b17 vs K i =67\u00b116 for R190/N192. Thus, formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI appears to behave as a \"super agonist\" with R190/K192 and R190/N192, so that occupation of only 5% of the receptors is able to bring about the internalization of 50% of them. We also tested formyl-NleNleWEDAVGWI (figure 3B) for its ability to cause down regulation of the receptor. Its behavior was essentially identical to that seen with formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI. This is in contrast to WEDAVGWI which was >10 fold weaker than WEDWVGWI in binding to the three FPRs. We also tested formyl-NleNleWED. This peptide exhibited very little downregulation at concentrations up to 50 \u03bcM with all three FPRs. Thus the VGWI portion of the peptide, formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI, appears to be essential for FPR activation.",

Bacteria (taxid:2) was used as the search organism. Two sequences of reasonable similarity to MMWEDAVGWI at their N-terminus were identified (Only N-termini would be formylated).

FTFEPFPTN produced very little inhibition of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-FITC binding also with at most 30% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM with the three FPR variants. Formyl-MFTFEPFPTN was very effective at inhibiting all three variants (Table 1) and exhibited significantly different K i s for W190/N192, R190/K192 and R190/N192 with K i s of 71\u00b14 nM, 16\u00b10.7 nM, and 9.5\u00b10.2 nM, respectively (P<0.0001 for each variant vs each of the other two).

The results are shown in Table  II . The sequence prediction of rhodopsin is also given since its crystal structure is known [37] . TMH V in rhodopsin begins at E202 and is the first residue predicted to have a non zero value for helix propensity. Underlined residues in the rhodopsin sequence are identical in FPR. W190/N192 exhibits a reduced helix propensity of 113 vs 140 for R190/N192 or 137 for R190/ K192 (summation of helix propensity for residues N-terminal to FPR P213 or rhodopsin P215; underlined in Table II) . PRISPED analysis of all three FPR sequences suggest that TMH V is longer than that observed with rhodopsin as we previously suggested [8] based on Kyte and Doolittle [38] analysis, but the predicted beginning of helix V varies depending upon the FPR sequence. Most interesting is the predicted effect W190/N192 has on the helix propensity of the residues N-terminal to FPR P213. P213 was previously shown to be important in FPR structure, since P213A did not fold properly and was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum [39] . Since proline is secondary amine, it cannot hydrogen bond and this destabilizes the helix N-terminal to the proline. In rhodopsin, the carbonyl of H211 hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate of E122 (which can only occur if H211 is not hydrogen bonded to P215, a residue highly conserved in GPCR [40] ). The H211 carbonyl is important in rhodopsin activation, since its hydrogen bonding with E122 is disrupted upon rhodopsin activation [41] . We have previously shown that F110, which is analogous to E122 of rhodopsin, is important in FPR activation, since the F110A mutant exhibits very poor coupling to G protein, and very poor chemotaxis toward fMLF [42] . While FPR F110 cannot hydrogen bond to the carbonyl of FPR G209 (analogous to rhodopsin H211), aromatic rings do exhibit energetically favorably interactions with carbonyl oxygens [43] . F110 interaction with the G209 carbonyl and disruption of the F110-G209 interaction by ligand binding could be important in FPR activation. The fact that W190/N190 is predicted to exhibit lower helicity near G209 may alter its ability to be activated in response to ligand binding.",

Here we observed that the three W in the peptide WEDWVGWI are all essential for FPR binding, just as they are essential for antiviral activity [31] . This could be due to changes in structure of the peptide since WEDWVGAI was shown by NMR in DMSO-water solution to adopt a different structure than WEDWVGWI [31] . Nonetheless, the correlation between antiviral activity and ability to interact with FPR is an intriguing one, especially since FPR is able to interact with the proximal membrane region of many viruses [8] .",

Most of the peptides evaluated interacted similarly with R190/K192 and R190/N192 FPRs, but both formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL and formyl-MFTFEPFPTN activated R190/K192 ~ 2fold more effectively than R190/N192. W190/N192 was activated much more poorly than either R190/ K192 or R190/N192 by all the formyl peptides investigated here and exhibited much greater differences in EC 50 s than observed for formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe. This was true even though W190/ N192 bound formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI and formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL with similar affinity to that observed with R190/K192 or R190/N192.

One possibility is that WEDWVGWI occupies the formyl-Met (or formyl-Nle) binding pocket but FTFEPFPTN does not.

We have also shown that W190 quenches the fluorescence of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-AlexaFluor, indicating W190 must reside close to the AlexaFluor moiety when this peptide is bound to FPR [8] . These findings are both consistent with the larger effects observed with W190/N192 with longer peptides since only peptides much longer than three residues are likely to interact near R or W190. In addition, provided that formyl-MFTFEPFPTN is a good model for CHIPS binding, this might indicate that the polymorphism W190/N192 would be more resistant to inhibition by CHIPS and thus those with this polymorphism might control infections with S. aureus better than those with the R190 polymorphism. Recent studies have indicated that a high percentage of normal individuals (24/24) express antibodies to CHIPS [47] , so that a polymorphism that was more resistant to its effect might exhibit a selective advantage, since W190/N192 retains most of its ability to interact with formylated tri peptides.
