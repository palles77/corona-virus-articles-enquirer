The high fatality rate is likely to decline as milder clinical cases emerge. Similar to SARS, common symptoms in patients with MERS-CoV include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Most patients have had pneumonia and the majority was reported to have multiple co-morbid conditions. 3, 4 The rapid deployment of effective therapeutics is a high priority as there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine for MERS-CoV. The clinical experience from SARS suggests that a number of interventions including ribavirin with and without corticosteroids, interferon alfa with corticosteroids, ribavirin with lopinavir and ritonavir, and convalescent plasma may improve the outcome in patients but the data are not conclusive. 5 The purpose of this review is first to summarize the effectiveness of these treatments, in an attempt to identify a therapeutic approach that could help select the most appropriate therapeutic options for patients with MERS-CoV infections.",

It is phylogenetically related to the SARS coronavirus and has also been associated with severe respiratory illness as well as nosocomial transmission in healthcare settings. Current international recommendations do not support any specific therapies; however, there are a number of agents, which were used during the SARS epidemic of 2003. It is possible that these might be active against the related MERS coronavirus. We have reviewed the literature on the safety and efficacy of therapies used in patients with SARS with a view to their potential use in patients with MERS-CoV infections.",

It is rather surprising that patients with long treatment delay had a good response. This is partly related to that the allocation to different regimens was not randomized and the criteria not described in the paper. Parameters that influenced treatment response were time from symptom onset to treatment day (P=0.003), time from admission to treatment day (P=0.001), time to maximal radiographic score from treatment day (P=0 .001), maximal radiographic score (P=0.009), SaO2 at maximal radiographic score (P= 0.13). or case series; agents included were ribavirin, interferon, Lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), and convalescent plasma.

Although infection control, molecular diagnostics and international public health have improved considerably since the 2003 SARS epidemic, there are still no proven or licensed therapies for any coronavirus infection. The high mortality associated with MERS-CoV led us to conduct this systematic review to summarize the available options for treatment for novel coronavirus infection based on previous reports of therapy of SARS, a related coronavirus.",

There were seven reports of the use of ribavirin in SARS patients although only four reported control groups. The mortality benefit was inconsistent with mortality rates of between 5% and 42.8%, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] two studies showed improvements of symptoms in 71.4%-80% of patients, and ICU admission rates of 13%-20%. 8, 9 The major problem with ribavirin was the significant incidence of adverse events especially hemolysis which was reported in 68.5%. 10 The timing of the start of antiviral agents is important in most virus infections. One study compared oseltamivir versus ribavirin and showed no obvious response to ribavirin, however, the treatment were started after 10-14 days of symptoms which might have led to the poorer outcomes. 11 There was only one randomized controlled trial: this compared ribavirin versus interferon-1a and showed no advantage of ribavirin over interferon in patients with SARS. 13 In addition, there were observational studies comparing Interferon-1a with untreated controls. 23 Interferon led to improvements in clinical and laboratory parameters compared with control patients. 23 However, there was no standard regime used and adverse events were not well documented.",

The use of the discussed agents would require monitoring hematological and biochemical parameters during treatment to detect and prevent adverse effects associated with therapy. Possible dosages of discussed agents especially with unavailability of intravenous ribavarin are listed in Table 5 . The table also includes the possible dosage of pegelated interferon-a (PegIFN-a) that is commonly used in the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. PegIFN-a was 50-100 times more effective in vitro for MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV. 25 The long half-life of PegIFN-a and the associated adverse effects calls for extra attention for the use of shorter-acting interferon. 25 The use of interferon therapy with ribavirin is not recommended in patients with hepatitis C virus infection and renal dysfunction (Clcr <50 mL/minute).",
