To move a topic higher up the agenda involves three elements: problems, proposals, and politics. These elements combine to create a 'policy window' [5] . In a policy window, decision-makers choose to pay attention to a specific topic. However, why one topic gets attention while others do not, is a matter of study. This choice is usually influenced by focusing events, which are 'dramatic episodes that attract attention' [6] .

Semmelweiss used a scientific demonstration to implement a new prevention strategy, but despite a first successful experience, his work faded away relatively quickly, with no further improvement. Conversely, Nightingale made better use of the policy window by using a scientific demonstration in combination with her personal influence and administrative empowerment to pursue future developments [7] . In her time, Nightingale was considered a heroine by British soldiers, and by the media. She wrote many letters to politicians about the improvement of care in hospitals not only in Britain but also in India, where she influenced sanitary reform.",

At that time, Brazil already had a national standard for hospital infection control committees (since 1983) but with no effective adherence in many hospitals. Only after the president's death were there more attempts to audit preventive structures in hospitals. Nevertheless this potential focusing event was forgotten and large-scale improvement did not happen as hoped. A celebrity drama may produce an initial commotion, but in general it does not last long enough to promote sustained improvement. In fact, more than 10 years later, another severe nosocomial outbreak which caused the deaths of 60 haemodialysis patients in Caruaru, Northwest region, emerged as a focusing event [10] . This highlighted the urgent need for sanitary audits to evaluate the quality of healthcare, and so, after many years of hesitancy, the national programme for HCAI prevention was transferred in 1999 to the Brazilian National Sanitary Agency which launched progressive action to achieve standardization and begin monitoring and evaluation [11] .",

These concerns were exemplified during the first years of the HIV epidemic, which brought much learning to infection prevention in healthcare. Infection prevention was further boosted by media coverage during other pandemics including severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza, Ebola and, more recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome [12] . High-profile epidemics have highlighted the pivotal role of infection prevention and control programmes in healthcare services to international bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO). These events also raise awareness of preventive measures among healthcare workers as they have an increased risk of contracting infectious diseases. Pandemics can reinforce standard precautions, especially around the use of gloves, alcohol hand rubs, and single-use devices. The increased uptake of such measures increases the use of hygiene-related products, which tends to amplify the number of suppliers and large-scale production, thus generating a reduction in their costs. Reduction of costs should minimize hesitation from administrators in purchasing these items at the necessary quantity.",

Unfortunately, scientific evidence does not reach a wide public and is rarely in the media.

It is proposed that scientific evidence would have greater effect during a policy window if it were used by researchers and professionals to demonstrate improvement in the quality of health with minimal economic impact. One can argue that the wider public might be a driver for public policies in HCAI. However, as with other issues, the public does not usually generate robust movements unless there is a substantial financial cost. Often, the public do not differentiate between an isolated clinical tragedy and a healthcare crisis. Society and professionals may have different perceptions about this problem and policy alternatives to solve it. For healthcare professionals, especially physicians, infection prevention is often seen as an intrusion because measures interfere with their work. However, it is possible that the worldwide movement for patient safety will lead to a change in paradigms [15] .",
