Travel-associated cases of the disease COVID-19 were reported outside of China as early as January 13, 2020 and the virus has subsequently spread to nearly all nations (World Health Organization, 2020a , 2020b . The first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States was a travel-associated case from Washington state on January 19, 2020 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a) . The majority of the early COVID-19 cases in the U.S. were either i) associated with travel to a \"high-risk\" country or ii) close contacts of previously identified cases, per the testing criteria adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b) . In response to the risk of more travel-associated cases, the U.S. placed travel restrictions on multiple countries with SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including China on January 31, Iran on February 29, and Europe on March 11 (Taylor, 2020) . However, community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the U.S. in late February when a California resident contracted the virus despite meeting neither testing criteria (Moon et al., 2020) .",

By sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from local cases and comparing their relatedness to virus genome sequences from other locations, we used 'genomic epidemiology' (Grubaugh et al., 2019a) to identify the likely sources of SARS-CoV-2 in Connecticut. We supplemented our viral genomic analysis with airline travel data from major airports in southern New England to estimate the risk of domestic and international importation therein. Our data suggest that the risk of domestic importation of SARS-CoV-2 into this region far outweighs that of international introductions regardless of federal travel restrictions, and find evidence for coast-to-coast U.S. SARS-CoV-2 spread.",

Using our amplicon sequencing approach, 'PrimalSeq' (Grubaugh et al., 2019b; Quick et al., 2017) , with the portable Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION platform, we generated the first SARS-CoV-2 genome approximately 14 hours after receiving the sample (CT-Yale-006), demonstrating our ability to perform near real-time clinical sequencing and bioinformatics. Our complete workflow included RNA extraction, PCR testing, validation of PCR results, library preparation, sequencing, and live base calling and read mapping. We shared the genomes of these viruses publicly as we generated them (GISAID EPI_ISL_416416-416424). We combined our genomes with other publicly available sequences for a final dataset of 168 SARS-CoV-2 genomes ( Figure 1, Data S2 ).

Our first nine SARS-CoV-2 genomes clustered into three distinct phylogenetic clades, indicating multiple independent virus introductions into Connecticut. Two of the genomes, CT-Yale-001 and CT-Yale-006, clustered primarily with viruses from China and Europe, respectively ( Figure 1A ). However, neither of the corresponding COVID-19 cases were travel-associated, which indicates that these patients were part of domestic transmission chains that stemmed from recent international virus introductions. The other seven SARS-CoV-2 genomes clustered with a large, primarily U.S. clade, within which the majority of genomes were sequenced from cases in Washington state ( Figure 1B ). Due to a paucity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from other regions within the U.S., we could not determine the exact domestic origin of these viruses in Connecticut. We also cannot yet determine whether the higher number of substitutions observed in CT-Yale-007 and CT-Yale-008 ( Figure 1B ) compared to the other Connecticut virus genomes within this clade was the result of multiple introductions or of significant undersampling. Importantly, however, our data indicate that by early to mid March there had already been interstate spread during the early COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. We constructed a maximum-likelihood tree using 168 global SARS-CoV-2 protein coding sequences, including 9 sequences from COVID-19 patients identified in Connecticut from March 6-14, 2020.

            "text": "By combining daily passenger volumes ( Figure 2B ) with COVID-19 prevalence at the travel route origin ( Figure 2C -D ) and accounting for differences in reporting rates, we found that both domestic and international SARS-CoV-2 importation started to increase dramatically at the beginning of March, 2020 ( Figure 2E ). Without accounting for the effects of international travel restrictions, our estimated domestic importation risk from the selected five U.S. states surpassed international importation risk by March 10. Using previous assumptions around travel restrictions (Chinazzi et al., 2020) , we also modeled two scenarios where federal travel restrictions reduced passenger volume by 40% and by 90% from the restricted countries ( Figure 2E ). Due to the overall low prevalence of COVID-19 in China, we did not find any significant effects of travel restrictions from China that were enacted on February 1st ( Data S3 ). Also, we did not find significant changes to the importation risk following travel restrictions from Iran on March 1, likely due to the relatively small number of passengers arriving from that country ( Data S3 ). While we did find a dramatic decrease in international importation risk following the restrictions on travel from Europe (March 13), this decrease occurred after our estimates of domestic travel importation risk had already surpassed that of international importation ( Figure 3E ). The dramatic rises in both domestic and international importation risk preceded the state-wide COVID-19 outbreak in Connecticut ( Figure  3E ), and the recent increase in risk of domestic importation may give rise to new outbreaks in the region. We selected three international airports in the region that are commonly used by Connecticut residents: Hartford (BDL), Boston (BOS), and New York (JFK). We used data from January to March, 2019, to estimate relative differences in daily air passenger volumes from the selected origins to the airport destinations. These daily estimates were then combined by either international or domestic travel. ( C-D ) The cumulative number of daily COVID-19 cases were divided by 100,000 population to calculate normalized disease prevalence for each location. ( E ) We calculated importation risk by modelling the number of daily prevalent COVID-19 cases in each potential importation source and then estimating the number of infected travelers using the daily air travel volume from each location. Data, criteria, and analyses used to create this figure can be found in Data S3 .",

            "text": "The combined results of our genomic epidemiology and travel pattern analyses suggest that domestic spread recently became a significant source of new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the U.S. We find strong evidence that outbreaks on the East Coast (Connecticut) are linked to outbreaks on the West Coast (Washington), demonstrating that trans-continental spread has already occured. As of March 25, there are >1000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced from around the world, including >350 from the U.S. ( https://nextstrain.org/ncov ); however most of the latter were obtained from a small number of U.S. states. Therefore, we cannot yet determine the exact origins of the viral introductions into Connecticut. Recent domestic travel history of the nine reported cases was not available, but it is unlikely that all of the infections originated in Washington state. Furthermore, due to low genetic diversity between these early sequences from Connecticut and Washington, we cannot yet determine how often the virus may be spreading between the U.S. coasts or whether an introduction from a common source is responsible for phylogenetic grouping. As testing capacity increases and more viral genome sequences become available from new locations, more granular reconstructions of virus spread throughout the U.S. will be possible (Grubaugh et al., 2019a) . Specifically, elucidating the phylogenetic relationship of viral genomes collected in Connecticut to those collected in neighboring states, especially those with a high burden of disease like New York, will improve our understanding of critical interstate dynamics.",

Because we do not have access to current airline data, we could not exactly quantify the impact of government restrictions on international travel. In addition, even without explicit government restrictions, general social distancing and work-from-home guidelines are reducing all airline travel. We did not account for these decreases in either our international or domestic travel data. While such variations may lower our domestic risk estimates, we also did not account for the large volumes of regional automobile and rail travel, especially along the corridor that connects Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C. to Connecticut. As such, the interconnectedness and large volumes of daily travel within the U.S. indicate that domestic spread of SARS-CoV-2 has become and will likely continue to be the primary source of new infections.",

In China, local outbreak dynamics were highly correlated with travel between Wuhan and the outbreak dynamics therein during the early months of the epidemic . Similarly, if interstate introductions are not curtailed in the U.S. with improved surveillance measures, more robust diagnostic capabilities, and proper clinical care, quelling local transmission within states will be a Sisyphean task. We therefore propose that a unified effort to detect and prevent new COVID-19 cases will be essential for mitigating the risk of future domestic outbreaks. This effort must ensure that states have sufficient personal protective equipment, sample collection materials, and testing reagents, as these supplies enable effective surveillance. Finally, stateand local-level policymakers must recognize that the health and well-being of their constituents are contingent on that of the nation. If spread between states is now common, as our results indicate, the U.S. will struggle to control COVID-19 in the absence of a unified surveillance strategy.",

These patients are all Connecticut residents, but we do not have access to location data associated with each of these early SARS-CoV-2 genomes to avoid patient identification. Swabs were placed in virus transport media (BD Universal Viral Transport Medium) immediately upon collection. Samples (200 \u00b5L) were subjected to total nucleic acid extraction using the NUCLISENS easyMAG platform (BioM\u00e9rieux, France) at the Yale Clinical Virology Laboratory. The recommended CDC RT-qPCR assay was used to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020c) . A total of 10 samples from 10 different individuals with cycle-threshold (CT) values less than 35 were selected to move forward with next generation sequencing (NGS). Of these, we were successfully able to generate sequencing libraries from nine samples. SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were processed for NGS using a highly multiplexed PCR amplicon approach for sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT; Oxford, United Kingdom) MinION using the V1 primer pools (Quick et al., 2017) . Sequencing libraries were barcoded and multiplexed using the Ligation Sequencing Kit and Native Barcoding Expansion pack (ONT) following the ARTIC Network's library preparation protocol (Quick, 2020) with the following minor modifications: cDNA was generated with SuperScriptIV VILO Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), a total of 20 ng of each sample was used as input into end repair, end repair incubation time was increased to 25 minutes followed by a 1:1 bead-based clean up, and Blunt/TA ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) was used to ligate barcodes to each sample. cDNA synthesis and amplicon generation was performed concurrently for each sample. Samples were processed by CT value to reduce the likelihood of contamination from high titer samples to low titer samples. Barcoding, adaptor ligation, and sequencing was performed on samples with CT values between 25-35 (low titer group) prior to samples with CT values below 25 (high titer group) ( Data S1 ). Two samples, Yale-006 and Yale-007, were diluted 1:100 in nuclease-free water prior to cDNA synthesis. A no template control was created at the cDNA synthesis step and amplicon generation step to detect cross-contamination between samples.

See Data S2 for a list of sequences and acknowledgements to the originating and submitting labs. No data that was only released on GISAID was used without consent from the authors (see Acknowledgements ). We aligned consensus genomes using the augur toolkit version 6.4.2 (Hadfield et al., 2018) . Specifically, we aligned sequences using mafft (Katoh et al., 2002) , masked sites at the 5' and 3' ends of the alignment as well as a small number of sites that likely vary due to assembly artefacts (see https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov ), and reconstructed a phylogeny using IQ-Tree (Nguyen et al., 2015) . These trees are further processed using augur and treetime to add ancestral reconstructions . Sequences in this sample differ from the root by 10 or fewer mutations. Bootstrap values are not a meaningful measure of branch support in this case. Instead, we directly show mutations supporting the major splits in the tree. The mutations defining these clades are compatible with the tree topology and are not homoplastic. The probability that all clade defining mutations arose multiple times independently in a manner compatible with the tree topology is vanishingly small.

Kennedy International Airport (JFK, New York, New York; ranked 6th). Air passenger data from 2020 is not currently available; thus, we used data from January to March 2019 to represent general trends in passenger volumes, as done previously (Bogoch et al., 2020) . We took the average of the 3-month passenger volumes to estimate the daily number of travelers entering each airport from the specified origin. To account for passenger reductions following U.S. government alerts and restrictions (Taylor, 2020) , we modeled two scenarios: a 40% reduction in passenger volume and a 90% reduction in passenger volume. These thresholds were determined based on previously reported estimates and assumptions around travel restrictions (Chinazzi et al., 2020) .",

Because of the evidence of pre-symptomatic transmission (Tindale et al., 2020), we also assumed that cases become infectious one day before symptom onset. To account for substantial uncertainty around reporting rates, we assigned different reporting rates to individual locations based on the testing criteria enacted in that location (Niehus et al., 2020) . For each country and state, we first extracted testing criteria from the department or ministry of health website. We assumed that countries or states with similar testing criteria policies captured similar proportions of true infections. Using the respective testing criteria, we categorized countries or states as having narrow, moderate, or broad testing levels. We then assigned reporting rates to each testing level by using the mean and 95% confidence interval of the reporting rate estimated by Nishiura et al. (Nishiura et al., 2020) : 0.092 (95% CI= 0.05-0.20). The reporting rate for the broadest testing level, \u03c1=0.20, also corresponded to the reporting rate in Mainland China (Chinazzi et al., 2020) . We thus assigned Iran, Florida, Washington, and Illinois to a \"narrow\" testing level (\u03c1=0.05); Spain, Italy, and Louisiana to a \"moderate'' testing level (\u03c1=0.092); and China, Germany, and California to a \"broad\" testing level (\u03c1=0.20, Data S2 , \"testing-criteria\" ).",
