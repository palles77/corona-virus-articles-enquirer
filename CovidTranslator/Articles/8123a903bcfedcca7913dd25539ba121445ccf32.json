Major outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 2 and H1N1 3 have focused attention on the need for a stronger understanding of public health while other documents, such as those produced by the IOM 4 and the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada, have described the need to increase the emphasis of effective teaching in public health and preventive medicine. 5 While there is a strong call for greater teaching, there is a relative dearth of articles that include evaluation of different methods of teaching. At the University of Toronto (U of T), the Determinants of Community Health (DOCH) course incorporated public health education across all 4 years of the medical curriculum. This paper describes the f\u0131rst 10 years of experience and evaluation of this course.

Health, Illness, and the Community, taught during the f\u0131rst 2 years of medical school, had a strong focus on experiential learning and required students to attend community-based education sessions. 6, 7 In contrast, the Determinants of Health course continued with the didactic approach to education, adding tutorial groups in which students worked on problem sets. Both courses had been operational for approximately 6 years when a decision was made to integrate the three courses (two from Health, Illness and the Community and one from Determinants of Health) into DOCH, which would span all 4 years of the medical curriculum.

On the other hand, similar sessions on public health where students visit a school and assess the health of a population of school children are slightly lower (Table 3) . Overall, lectures delivered by patients or members of the community (e.g., a drug addict presenting on the heroin replacement program) had the highest ratings, followed by community visits.

First, the improvement in the ranking and increase in the average score of U of T graduates relative to those of all Canadian graduates was accomplished with no change in the amount of curricular time. The total number of educational hours offered in the Health, Illness, and the Community/Determinants of Health curriculum was the same as that of the DOCH curriculum. The essential difference was the organization of the material into a longitudinal curriculum and a change in the timing of the course (moving 1 week from the third year to the fourth year of the curriculum). The other comparison is between U of T and the other medical schools. During this time, no other Canadian medical school used a longitudinal curriculum. Taken together, these results indicate the relative effectiveness of teaching public health in a longitudinal fashion. The use of a longitudinal curriculum has helped to keep the course focused. There was one overall course planning committee and one course director who was responsible for the curriculum planning and delivery of all 4 years. The course planning committee had student representatives from all 4 years. Since many curricular topics have a community health component, there has been a strong pressure to keep adding more and more topics to the DOCH course, particularly those that did not f\u0131t well with the other courses being offered.

            "text": "Perception that the material learned in DOCH 2 will be useful in future practice 3 for assessing these potential new components relative to the student learning objectives. In many instances, the new components were rejected or moved to another time due to this incompatibility. For example, the suggestion of teaching how to interview patients with disabilities living in the community was felt to f\u0131t with the clinical skills course. The inclusion of such material would have lead to potential confusion among the students about the core content of public health. The student satisfaction scores were used in planning class activities and to increase the student appeal of the course. The examples shown in Table 3 were chosen as they were typical of the student evaluations over the years. As can be seen, the f\u0131rst-year community f\u0131eld visits ranked extremely high. On the other hand, the values for the second year were lower. The latter were interpreted to be due to the fact that the lectures on research methodology were general in nature and the students had to apply material to their individual project. Based on these evaluation scores, more relevant speakers were identif\u0131ed and other educational resources were developed, such as web-based modules to help students with specif\u0131c educational needs (e.g., many students conduct surveys, so a module on survey research was added). A second reason for the lower scores is that secondyear students have to take an active role in engaging with the sponsoring agencies to complete their projects.",
