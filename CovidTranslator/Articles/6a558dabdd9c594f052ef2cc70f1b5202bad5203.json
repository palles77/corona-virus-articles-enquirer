However, outbreaks of respiratory infection in Hutterite colonies occur regularly, as viruses are introduced from exposure to people outside the community. As the colonies are not very large, it is possible to obtain detailed demographic, health, and immunization information from all members. 8 The implementation of a cluster randomized trial aimed at reducing influenza in the Canadian Hutterite community allowed us to prospectively collect data on other respiratory viruses. In this report, we sought to determine age-specific incidence of laboratoryconfirmed respiratory virus infection occurring in the Hutterite community and to document the temporal relationship of virus-specific attack rates.",

Research nurses assessed all study participants twice weekly using a standardized checklist of self-reported symptoms or signs from study participants or parents. One representative from each household (e.g., the mother) was designated to complete the checklist for all family members and provide this when the research nurse made a site visit. The nurse would review the checklist. If anyone reported new symptoms, the nurse interviewed the study participant to confirm their symptoms and date of onset. A nasopharyngeal specimen was obtained if two or more of the following symptoms were present: fever ( \u202138\u00b0C), cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, headache, sinus problems, muscle aches, fatigue, ear ache or infection, or chills. Research nurses would also contact the household representative if the self-reported checklists were incomplete, to follow-up on missing data.

To calculate incidence, we counted only the first viral infection for a specific virus, as the numerators (age-specific), while the denominators were age-specific person-days, which included the entire period of surveillance for participants who were not infected with the specific virus along with the person-days up to the point of infection for those who were infected. If a participant was swabbed more than once within 14 days, and if the same virus was detected on \u20211 occasion in this time frame, then only the first episode detected was used in the analysis. To quantify the temporal relationship between the respiratory viruses, we defined an epidemic midpoint as the date when 50% of the cumulative cases of virus detected were reached over the period of surveillance. 9 This was calculated for both influenza and non-influenza viruses. We calculated incidence using events per 1000 person-days and estimated differences in rates assuming a Poisson distribution. 10 ",

The incidence generally decreases in teenaged participants and in young adults and then either reaches a plateau or increases slightly with advanced age. This could be explained by the higher incidence of viral respiratory infection in age <5 compared to older individuals, but also by the lower detection rate of respiratory virus in the elderly due to reduced viral shedding in older age groups. 13 Influenza B infection, unlike influenza A, was not observed among adults >30. The most likely explanation is due to the relative conservation of influenza B immunity in older individuals, as previously reported. 14, 15 The incidence of entero \u2044 rhinovirus and coronavirus infection in older individuals was relatively higher than that of other viruses, consistent with previous studies. 16 Our study has several limitations. First, the respiratory virus test is performed only within symptomatic participants during the influenza season, and the respiratory virus shedding in asymptomatic control is not evaluated. Second, because the study is performed during the 2008-2009 influenza season, it potentially underestimates the annual incidence of respiratory viruses other than influenza which may have different season or which may cause biannual epidemic. Third, it is performed in Hutterite colonies that do not represent the general population of Canada. Another limitation is that there were three colonies dropped out of the study after randomization. However, as the characteristics of these colonies do not differ from those of the 46 colonies that participated the study, we consider this did not affect the results.",
