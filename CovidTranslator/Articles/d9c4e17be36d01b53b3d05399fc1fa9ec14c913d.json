Design: A retrospective chart review. Setting: A tertiary referral hospital. Participants: Ten patients with AIP who presented with idiopathic ARDS and showed diffuse alveolar damage on surgical lung biopsy specimens from July 1995 to March 2004. Measurements and results: The median age of patients was 65.5 years (age range, 38 to 73 years). Patients presented with a median duration of severe dyspnea of 9.5 days (range, 2 to 34 days) at the hospital visit. All patients required mechanical ventilation beginning at median time of hospital day 1 (range, hospital day 0 to 5), which continued for a median duration of 9.5 days (range, 4 to 98 days). Patients received ventilation in the pressure assist-control mode with a median tidal volume of 6.97 mL/kg (range, 6.05 to 8.86 mL/kg) and median positive endexpiratory pressure of 11 cm H 2 O (range, 8 to 16 cm H 2 O). An aggressive diagnostic workup for respiratory infection, including BAL at a median time of hospital day 2 (range, hospital day 1 to 5) was performed. High-dose steroid pulse therapy was initiated on median hospital day 3.5 (range, hospital day 1 to 8), while surgical lung biopsy was performed on median hospital day 4 (range, hospital day 2 to 7). Eight patients (80%) survived to hospital discharge. Conclusion: Earlier intervention, such as an aggressive diagnostic approach, mechanical ventilation with lung-protective strategy, and the early institution of immunosuppressive may improve clinical outcome in patients with AIP.",

[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Ac-cording to these reports, this uncommon disease is characterized by the rapid development of acute respiratory failure in a previously healthy individual and high mortality despite intensive treatment, including mechanical ventilation. However, some reports on AIP 10 -13 showing higher survival rates have suggested that AIP might not be a fatal disease. To date, no guideline on the management of AIP has been published. Patients with AIP usually require mechanical ventilation and some receive therapy with corticosteroids, but it is unclear whether this treatment is effective in patients with AIP.",

Among them, 42 patients were found to have a pathologic diagnosis of DAD. Internal review board approval for chart review was obtained, and informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. Medical records and pathologic findings for these 42 patients were reviewed to diagnose AIP. Our diagnostic criteria for AIP were as follows: (1) acute respiratory failure developing within 2 months; (2) the presence of DAD on surgical lung biopsy specimens; (3) the absence of underlying chronic pulmonary disease or previously abnormal chest radiograph findings; (4) the absence of any known inciting event or predisposing condition for ARDS such as respiratory infection, collagen vascular disease, exposure to environmental or occupational toxic agents, drugs, or radiation, and prior interstitial lung disease; and (5) no recent history of shock or use of vasopressors prior to hospital admission. 1, 3, 7, 8 Following a review of the medical records for each case, 29 patients were excluded from the study because they had known causes of DAD. Their etiologies for DAD were infections (n \u03ed 13), drugs (n \u03ed 7), collagen vascular diseases (n \u03ed 4), acute exacerbation of usual interstitial pneumonia (n \u03ed 2), and others (n \u03ed 3). Then, pathology slides for the remaining 13 patients with DAD were further reviewed by two experienced lung pathologists (J.H. and M.K.). When the lung pathologists did not concur on the diagnosis, the case was excluded from the analysis. An alternative histopathologic diagnosis was suggested by one of the pathologist in three cases (bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia in two patients and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia in one patient). Thus, of the initial 42 patients who showed the presence of DAD on surgical lung biopsy specimens, 10 patients were determined to be definitive AIP cases and were included in the final analysis.",

As outlined above, our diagnostic and therapeutic approach was quite decisive. Appropriate cultures and serology for microbial agents were performed on median day 1 with the institution of empirical antibiotics as recommended by American Thoracic Society. All patients eventually warranted mechanical ventilation with a lung-protective strategy. BAL was performed on median day 2. Once infection was deemed unlikely, high-dose steroid pulse therapy was started on median day 3. To confirm the diagnosis of AIP, surgical lung biopsy was performed on median day 4. With this aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach, 80% of our patients with AIP survived to hospital discharge although they had presented with acute lung injury/ARDS, as indicated by a rapid respiration rate, low Pao 2 /Fio 2 ratio, and the need for mechanical ventilation in all patients. The high survival rate of our patients is sharply contrasted with the rate in early reports on AIP patients and is more similar to the rates in more recent reports (Table 3 ). In the reports from before 2000, the mortality rate of patients with AIP was very high, ranging from 59 to 100%. 4 -9 Even in the study by Vourlekis et al 10 in 2000, which had reported an overall mortality rate of 33%, the mortality rate is 50% if patients who were referred from other hospitals are excluded. The only series showing a similar mortality rate was the one by Quefatieh et al 12 in 2003, which reported a 12.5% hospital mortality rate in eight patients with AIP.",

The pathologic features of our patients support this finding because nonsurvivors and one patient with residual fibrosis showed markedly increased fibroproliferative reactions with severe architectural distortion (Fig 2, bottom left, E, and bottom right, F) compared to other survivors without residual fibrosis (Fig 2, top left, A, top right, B,  middle left, C, and middle right, D) .

            "text": "The role of corticosteroids in the treatment of AIP is controversial. Corticosteroids can inhibit the production of a number of proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, oxygen radicals, eicosanoids, and complement products, which are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of AIP. Therapy with corticosteroids also can inhibit the fibrotic response, which may be beneficial in AIP patients. 18 Olson et al 8 analyzed the impact of corticosteroid therapy on patient survival in their series of AIP patients and found no association. But a dra- matic response to corticosteroids in AIP patients has been reported in isolated cases. 11, 13 All patients in the series by Quefatieh et al 12 received corticosteroids, prompting the authors to suggest that the earlier and more frequent use of corticosteroids may have favorably influenced the outcome of their patients with AIP. We chose to use pulse steroid therapy followed by the prolonged administration of corticosteroids. To our knowledge, this report is the first one that has used a standard corticosteroid regimen in AIP patients. Pulse steroid therapy has been reported to be effective in patients with fulminant lupus pneumonitis. Domingo-Pedrol and coworkers 19 reported the successful treatment of patients with lupus pneumonitis with the administration of 1,000 mg/d methylprednisolone for 5 days followed by 60 mg of prednisolone. Also, Freter and coworkers 20 used 750 mg/d methylprednisolone for 3 days followed by 60 mg of prednisolone in their patient. Since the lung injury seen in AIP patients is also immune-mediated and is similar in severity to that seen in patients with fulminant lupus pneumonitis, we used comparable doses of these drugs in our patients. Ichikado et al 21 used a similar steroid regimen to treat their AIP patients. Pulse steroid therapy is also reported to be more effective than lower dosages of steroids in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. 22 In treating patients who are suspected of having AIP, it is our practice to investigate extensively to rule out respiratory infection as an etiology of respiratory failure. Blood and sputum cultures, and serologic tests for Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and Chlamydia pneumoniae are performed. BAL is done with stains and cultures of BAL fluid for bacterial organisms, acid-fast bacilli, Pneumocystis carinii, and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus. Also, lung tissue obtained during surgical lung biopsy is processed for tissue culture and immunostaining for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and adenovirus. The results of these microbiological studies were extensively reviewed in our patients to rule out infection. In some of the patients, the severity of their conditions necessitated the initiation of steroid therapy before all of the results of microbiological studies had been reported, and in two patients steroid therapy was initiated before BAL was performed. But in every patient, BAL was performed within 24 h of the initiation of steroid therapy.",

Viral cultures are tricky and are slow to grow, special studies on lung specimens take time, and the serologic diagnosis could take weeks to confirm. In fact, of our original 42 patients with DAD, 4 of 13 patients with DAD of infectious origin received steroid pulse therapy due to unexplained rapid progressive lung infiltration in a previously healthy individual after confirming the presence of DAD in a biopsy specimen with negative culture findings. Legionella pneumonia was later diagnosed in one patient because of a fourfold increase in the antibody titer, and three patients were later found to be positive for adenovirus on immunostaining of their lung specimen. Two patients who were positive for adenovirus on immunostaining died.

But, we think that the early institution of treatment may be important in improving the prognosis of AIP patients and that our overall management approach was beneficial to these patients as a whole (survival rate, 72%). Besides, therapy with corticosteroids, including pulse therapy, has been used to treat different viral pneumonias especially when they are life-threatening. 23 Mechanical ventilation can cause lung injury, if alveolar overdistension or cyclic collapse and reopening of alveolar units occur during tidal breathing. 24, 25 To minimize ventilator-associated lung injury, lungprotective strategies have been proposed for patients with ARDS, emphasizing the need to \"open the lung and keep the lung open\" while avoiding alveolar overdistension. 26 It is widely accepted that the use of low tidal volume to limit airway pressure and alveolar overdistension can improve survival in patients with acute lung injury, 27 although the clinical usefulness of therapy with high PEEP in patients already receiving ventilation with low tidal volume has been questioned. 28 The improvement in the survival of ARDS patients over the last few years is thought to reflect changes in the ventilatory approach in these patients. 29 In our institution, from as early as 1996 our standard approach to ventilating acute lung injury patients was low tidal volume (ie, 6 to 8 mL/kg) with a moderate level of PEEP. Thus, most of our patients received mechanical ventilation in this manner, which may have contributed to the favorable outcome seen in our series. The tidal volume data in Table 1 were calculated from measured body weight, which is known to be about 20% higher than the predicted body weight (used by the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network 27 ) in Western countries. So, the tidal volumes used in our patients may have been slightly higher than those used in the lower tidal volume group of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network study 27 but were still lower than those used in the higher tidal volume group. Also, all of our patients had peak airway pressures (a good surrogate for plateau pressure since patients were ventilated with pressurelimited ventilation) of \u03fd 30 cm H 2 O, at least until the time surgical lung biopsies were performed, suggesting that the overstretching of the alveoli should have been minimal. But it is not possible to evaluate the contribution, if any, that our ventilatory approach had on mortality in our patients based on our data alone.",

One explanation may be a sampling error due to the relatively small size of the sample and the possibility that patients whose lungs were less severely injured might have been preferentially included in the study. But with a rare disease such as AIP, it is very difficult to have a large number of patients, and other studies of AIP also had numbers of patients that were comparable to those in our study. Also our patients were severely ill, as evidenced by low the Pao 2 /Fio 2 ratio and the high respiration rate. Thus, it is unlikely that the differences in mortality that were seen in our patients were due entirely to this factor. Also, it is impossible to rule out that patients with more severe AIP might have died before reaching our hospital or could not undergo open-lung biopsy due to the severity of their condition. This is a limitation of the retrospective design of this study and previous studies of AIP as well, and it will not be adequately addressed until a prospective study is performed.",
