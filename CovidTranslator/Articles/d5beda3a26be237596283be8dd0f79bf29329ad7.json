Due to mismatch between choice of empirical antibiotics and in vitro susceptibility test results, administration of effective antibiotics was delayed by 6-times in the case of antibiotic-resistant E.coli and K.pneumoniae infections compared with susceptible strains (72 hours vs 11 hours) (Lautenbach et al. 2001) . Also, patients infected with resistant strains are more frequently associated with more severe underlying illness requiring longer hospitalization. For example, patients with CRE infections are more likely to be a transplant recipient, require mechanical ventilation, a prolonged hospitalization, ICU stays, or use of central venous catheters (Borer et al. 2009 ). Patients infected with resistant strains are more likely to develop complications and long-term sequelae. For example, MRSA infection caused higher incidence of complications by 69% compared with MSSA infection. The most frequent complications are a progression of the local infection (RR 3.25) and pneumonia (RR 2.28) (Cecchini et al. 2015) .",

According to the World Bank report to estimate the AMR impact on global GDP in -2050 (World Bank, 2016 , in the optimistic \"low-AMR\" scenario, global economic output is projected to be 1% lower by 2030 ($1 trillion) and 1.1% lower by 2050 than in the base case. In the pessimistic \"high-AMR impact\" scenario, global economic output would be 3.2% lower in 2030 ($3.4 trillion) and 3.8% lower by 2050 than in the base case. It means that in the \"high-AMR\" scenario, economic damage will be greater than that in 2008-2009 global financial crisis which caused 3.6% drop in the global GDP. Economic impact of AMR differs by countries with different economic level. Low-income and lower middle-income countries would have greater impact of economic loss (5.6% loss of GDP) due to AMR compared with high-income countries (3.1% loss of GDP), particularly in the \"high-AMR\" scenario. Global economy is negatively affected by AMR in various aspects such as international trade, livestock production, and healthcare expenditures. By 2050, the volume of global real exports may decrease by 1.1% in the \"low-AMR\" scenario and by 3.8% in the \"high-AMR\" scenario. In the \"high-AMR\" scenario, healthcare expenditures in 2050 would be as 25% higher than the baseline values for low-income countries, 15% higher for middle-income countries, and 6% higher for high-income countries. The additional expenditures in 2050 would be $1.2 trillion annually in the \"high-AMR\" scenario. In the US, CDC estimated the cost of AMR as a total of $55 billion per year : $20 billion in excess for direct healthcare costs and $35 billion for indirect societal costs due to loss of productivity (CDC, 2013) . In Europe, the overall economic burden of AMR was estimated to be at least 1.5 billion euros; 60 % for direct costs and 40% for indirect costs (ECDC/EMEA, 2009 ). Data on the economic impact of AMR in major pathogens showed that healthcare costs significantly increase in the treatment of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant strains (Maragakis et al. 2008) ; MRSA bacteremia (US$ 6,916), MRSA surgical site infection (US$ 13, 901) , VRE infection (US$ 12, 766) , and ESBL or KPC-producing E.coli or Klebsiella infection (1.7fold increase).",

Over time, however, rising levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among a wide range of pathogens has placed such gains at risk of being lost. Reducing AMR is now a top-level global public health priority. In principle, the major high-level goals consist of optimizing the use of such drugs in health and agriculture and minimizing environmental contamination; sustaining the development of new classes of antimicrobials drugs and other medicines and making them affordable and accessible to all who need them; and much more effective application of infection control and prevention principles. For decades, technical solutions have been the primary approach used for addressing AMR. More recently, FAO, OIE and WHO in combination with like-mined champions have embarked upon a more political and broader \"one health\" approach to increase awareness and engagement beyond scientific and medical groups. This change is the basis for the 2015 Global Action for AMR, the 2016 High Level Meeting on AMR held at the UN General Assembly and attention to AMR by groups such as the G20. While such results have been instrumental in broadening the awareness and attention paid to AMR, it is now critical to adopt concrete and focused activities to consolidate and build upon these gains. The fundamental building blocks will be proposed and discussed.",

However, using whole genome sequencing analysis, at least two of the clones have different clades that have evolved independently of each other. In clonal complex 8 nine phylogenetic clades with at least eight independent events of methicillin-resistance acquisition have been identified. Subsequently, it has been hypothesised USA300 did not evolve from the healthcare-associated ST8-IV USA500 clone, the historic CA-MRSA from Western Australia, or the PVL-positive MSSA clone from Trinidad and Tobago or Western Africa, but most likely from PVL-positive MSSA circulating within the USA. The ancestor of the USA300 clade emerged in central Europe in the mid-19 th century and exported to North America in the early 20 th century. Once in North America the clone progressively acquired the USA300 characteristic genetic specifications, diversified and spread globally including Africa. Within the USA300 clade two closely related ST8-IV clones are recognised: USA300, primarily isolated in North America (ST8-MRSA-IVa, spa t008 lukS-PV/lukF-PV, ACME positive, msrA-mediated macrolide resistance genes) and the USA300 Latin American Variant, primarily isolated in South America (ST8-MRSA-IVc, spa t008, lukS-PV/lukF-PV, ACME negative, tetK, copper and mercury resistance genes). Similarly, ST59 MRSA is also not a single clone but consists of two major clades, one originating in the USA and the other in East Asia.

            "text": "The co-emergence of multiple CA-MRSA lineages that have risen independently in most parts of the world has been striking. To date no single genetic or epidemiological factor has been identified that accounts for the extraordinary success of some genetically distinct CA-MRSA clones. Over time, some CA-MRSA clones will replace HA-MRSA clones, which will have significant clinical and public health implications. Along the way they will become increasing antibiotic resistant making the distinctions between HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA blurred and antimicrobial treatment difficult. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been a major cause of healthcare-associated infections with significant morbidity and mortality, and it has become one of the most important nosocomial pathogens in many countries worldwide since 1980s. In particular, several MRSA clones have been successful in spreading and causing infections in the hospitalized patients. The prevalence rates of MRSA in S. aureus isolates from the hospitalized patients have become high enough to spread into the community. Interestingly, during the past two decades, the emergence of community-associated (CA-) MRSA clones has greatly affected the global epidemiology of S. aureus infection. Circulating CA-MRSA clone varies according to the region, and it includes ST8 (USA300), ST80, ST30, ST59, ST72, ST772 and ST22 which mostly belong to SCCmec type IV or V. As a result, the proportion of MRSA in community-acquired S. aureus infections has been significantly increasing in many countries. Furthermore, many reports have shown that CA-MRSA clones have replaced traditional hospital-endemic MRSA clones. Such an influx of dominant CA-MRSA clones into the hospitals has been making the 'search and destroy' policy which have contributed to maintain low MRSA rates in some countries difficult to maintain. In addition, there has been concern that healthcareassociated infections such as surgical site infection caused by CA-MRSA may increase. In this talk, an update on CA-MRSA epidemiology in healthcare-associated infection and concerns on infection prevention and control will be discussed. The newly emerging Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a severe respiratory infection with a high mortality rate (\u223c35%), and has been a global threat due to continuous outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula and international spread by infected travelers since 2012. From May to July 2015, a large outbreak initiated by an infected traveler from the Arabian peninsula swept South Korea, and resulted in 186 confirmed cases with 38 deaths (case-fatality rate: 20.4%). Here, we show the rapid emergence and spreading of a mutant MERS-CoV with reduced affinity to the human receptor, CD26, during the Korean outbreak. We isolated thirteen new viral genomes from fourteen infected patients treated at a hospital and found that twelve of them possess a point mutation in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of viral spike (S) protein. We also analyzed clinical data and specimens from fourteen MERS patients treated in a hospital who collectively represent a wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from mild febrile illness to fatal pneumonia. Comparative and kinetic analyses revealed that high viral loads, weak antibody responses, and lymphopenia accompanying thrombocytopenia were associated with disease mortality, whereas persistent and gradual increases in lymphocyte responses might be required for effective immunity against MERS-CoV infection. The correlation of the virological and immunological responses with disease severity and mortality, as well as their responses to current antiviral therapy, may have prognostic significance during the early phase of MERS. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) was discovered as an infectious disease caused by a novel bunyavirus in China in 2011 (N Engl J Med, 2011 . The causative agent for SFTS is named SFTS virus (SFTSV), which is a tick-borne virus and belongs to the Family Buniyaviridae, Genus Phlebovirus. The virus infection causes generalized infections with a high case fatality rate. In late 2012, it was discovered that SFTS was also endemic to Japan (Takahashi T, et al., JID, 2014) . SFTS is endemic to China, South Korea, and Japan. Since the discovery of SFTS endemic to Japan in January 2013, approximately 240 patients with SFTS have been reported to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. The case fatality is about 25%. Most of the patients were aged over 40's.",

Most fatal SFTS patients showed symptoms of hemorrhage and deterioration in consciousness. One of the patients showed a symptom of bloody vomit.

            "text": "In the presentation, I will present the overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology evaluated through pathological autopsy, and the development strategy of antiviral drug therapy for SFTS. This disease, SFTS, continues to be endemic to China, Korea, and Japan for the future. We can not escape from the risk being infected with SFTSV. On the other hand, there is a potential that favipiravir has a therapeutic effect in the treatment of SFTS. Safe and efficacious vaccine against SFTS should be developed. Furthermore, I will discuss the issues to be addressed to reduce the SFTS disease burden. The challenges posed by infectious diseases in the 21 st century are forever growing more complex and numerous. There are no magic bullets or simple solutions that we can employ in our battle against the array of pathogens that every day attack humans, animals and plants. But there is much that we can do to mitigate the changing landscape of infectious diseases threats. This presentation will expand upon Dr. Osterholm's previous plenary session lecture. It will go into detail describing the major steps we can and must take to tip the balance between the growing threat of infectious diseases and our ability to anticipate these threats and prevent and control them before they can result in increased morbidity and mortality. The polymyxins, colistin ( polymyxin E) and polymyxin B, are effective antibiotics against most multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negatives and are currently considered as the last-line drugs for treating severe bacterial infections. Polymyxin resistance among Gram-negatives has increased gradually for the last few years, and knowledge of its multifaceted resistance mechanisms is expanding. Typically, colistin resistance is due to chromosomally mediated modulation of two-component regulatory systems leading to modification of lipid A that resulted in reduced affinity to polymyxins. Clones of polymyxin-resistant Gram-negatives have spread in some hospitals, but have not significantly affected the use of polymyxins. These resistance genes are generally not transmissible between bacteria and so have not disseminated widely. However, a newly discovered plasmid-mediated polymyxin resistance gene mcr-1 has been detected in many countries in different geographical regions of the world since its first report in 2016. Therefore, it seems inevitable that plasmid-mediated transfer of polymyxin resistance will seriously reduce the lifespan of the polymyxins as the backbone of regimens against infections due to MDR Gram-negatives. This review provides an update on epidemiology and mechanisms of polymyxin resistance among different commonly encountered MDR Gram-negative bacilli. Some unresolved questions with respect to polymyxin resistance are also discussed. One of the few remaining options for the infectious disease caused by multiple-drug resistant Gram-negative bacilli is colistin. Accordingly, emerging mobile colistin resistance mcr-1 for phosphoethanolamine transferase became a death threat to public health. Various Enterobacteriaceae carrying mcr-1-plasmids from human beings, animals, and environments were reported in Asia, Europe, Africa, and North and South America. In South Korea, by the retrospective screening for the animal-oriented Escherichia coli strains, the mcr-1 positive isolates have been identified. To evaluate mcr-1-positive clinical strains, a total of 9396 Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected between 2010 and 2015 were screened and, finally, three strains, two Escherichia coli belonging to either ST1011 or ST101 and one Enterobacter aerogenes, harboring the gene were identified. All possessed IncI2 mcr-1-plasmids and colistin MICs were 4 g/ml in E. coli strains and 32 g/ml in E. aerogenes. The bla CTX-M-55 gene for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was co-carried in the mcr-1-plasmid of E. aerogenes and extra plasmids carrying bla CTX-M-55 , bla CTX-M-27 , and bla NDM-9 were co-harbored by E. coli strains. One of the E. coli strains produced complete conjugal machinery presenting the best efficiency of plasmid transfer while E. aerogenes having a truncated prepilin peptidase PilU resulting in complete loss of conjugal activity. The plasmid in E. coli transferred efficiently to E. coli recipients compared to K. pneumoniae and to Enterobacter cloacae probably due to the species-specificity allowed by rearranged shufflon. Previously identified 11 mcr-1-positive E. coli strains of animal-origin from South Korea also possessed IncI2 mcr-1-plasmid and the non-self-transferable mcr-1-plasmid in E. aerogenes was closely associated to those, while the self-transferable mcr-1-plasmid in E. coli strains were alike to each other. The plasmid carrying the gene, or the bacterial host harboring the plasmid, has come from animals as the previous reports illustrated. Better stewardship for the proper usage of antimicrobials as well as a collaborating surveillance study as a concept of one-health is needed.",

            "text": "Unlike the mcr mechanisms that readily spread horizontally via plasmids, colistin resistance in these XDR species usually arises through selective pressure in patients upon treatment with colistin, though outbreaks have also been reported on occasions. Development of colistin resistance in these strains means few or even no remaining active agents. However, patients who are affected by these bacteria are medically complex, heterogenous, and difficult to enroll into clinical trials for many reasons. Consequently, clinical data associating colistin resistance, antimicrobial therapy given and patient outcome are scarce and retrospective in nature for the most part. For K. pneumoniae, limited data suggest that mortality of infection from colistin-resistant strains may be lower when treated with gentamicin-containing regimens than those without gentamicin, but this approach is only applicable when the infecting strain is susceptible to this agent. Fortunately, the approval of ceftazidime-avibactam has ameliorated concerns over colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae at least for the time being, as therapy with ceftazidime-avibactam appears to improve clinical outcome of infected patients over those treated with colistin-based regimens. Interestingly, gastrointestinal decolonization with gentamicin may reduce infections and mortality in those known to be colonized with colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae, but the recent spread of mcr genes in humans brings into question the long-term viability of this approach. There are even less clinical data regarding the treatment of infections caused by colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. In vitro data variably support colistin-based combinations with partner agents including carbapenems, rifampicin, fosfomycin, and even gram-positive agents like vancomycin in the case of A. baumannii, but without accompanying robust clinical data. There are several novel agents with activity against colistin-resistant strains in late-stage clinical development. They include novel beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, a siderophore cephalosporin, an aminoglycoside and tetracyclines. Most of them target carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, while some are also active against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. These new agents are bound to change the paradigm for the treatment of infections caused by colistin-resistant Gram-negatives, but uncertainties are still likely to remain, including which agent to use, how to optimize dosing in to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity as well as potential for development of resistance, and whether use of more than one agent would still be needed.",

            "text": "In the United States, telehealth represents a rapid, convenient, and cost-effective solution for non-life threatening conditions, including acute respiratory infections, urinary tract infection (UTI), and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Over 1.25 billion outpatient \"bricks and mortar\" visits occur annually in the US, and it is estimated that one third of these visits (417 million) can be handled through telehealth. Furthermore, one third of this subgroup of consults (140 million) are related to infectious disease causes. Until recently, the provision of diagnostic testing, in conjunction with telemedicine physician consults, was difficult due to diverse geo-locations of patients, physicians and testing laboratories. For example, in the virtual world of telehealth, a patient can be located in California, with the physician licensed to practice in California located three time zones away in New York. Linkage of the physician and patient is now easily accomplished by electronic means (e.g., video conferencing, phone calls, text messaging). However, obtaining specimens from the patient and then transporting the specimen to the appropriate testing laboratory has been a challenge, such that most telemedicine consults are performed without diagnostic testing and empiric treatment is provided. This approach, especially with acute respiratory infection, could result in overuse or underuse of antibiotics. This lecture will describe new approaches to diagnostic testing for infectious diseases in the telehealth ecosystem. Included is a description of the infrastructure requirements required and/or recently developed to accommodate specimen acquisition and testing through aggregation (\"uber\"-ization), of both physicians and laboratory patient service centers, provision of \"round the clock\" mobile collection (in-home collection) services and self-collection and self-testing. Also, the cost-savings of these approaches, in contrast to traditional bricks and mortar approaches will be discussed. Rapid molecular, point of care testing instruments are now available for the accurate and complete (no confirmation testing required) testing for Group A Streptococcus for throat swab specimens, and Influenza and RSV for nasopharyngeal swab specimens; future testing capabilities include sexually transmitted diseases like Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and human papilloma virus (HPV). These new devices will accommodate the next inflection point in virtual medicine: point of patient testing, including testing the patients in their homes. The World Bank estimates that epidemics will cost $6 trillion dollars in the 21 st centuryroughly $60 billion per year. The $6 billion cost of the Ebola epidemic was its economic impact (in countries that can least afford it); however the impact of Ebola on families, social customs, and health infrastructure will have long term consequences. In addition, funding for epidemic diseases waxes and wanes with the passage of the epidemic, and as a consequence longer term preventive solutions, such as vaccines, have little means for progressing. In 2016 several nations and charitable foundations launched a new enterprise known as CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. CEPI will fund the development of vaccine candidates for diseases of epidemic potential, the initial candidates are MERS, Nipah and Lassa fever. We will review product development activities in these diseases and also detail attempts by international organizations to try to develop a framework around responses to public health emergencies of international concern.",

One health approaches, 'One hdealth, one medicine', have been globally recognized to control zoonotic diseases. World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) has reported 60% of human pathogens are animal origin and more than 75% of emerging animal diseases are zoonoses. This means collaboration and cooperation between animal and human medicine together can only solve the problem. Recent huge outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Korea have been more pay attention to implement one health approaches in practice. We experienced several HPAI epidemics past ten years and the MERS in 2015 and had to bear huge damages. One health becomes a key approach to control zoonotic diseases systemically and effectively. A 'One health' approach to minimize the antimicrobial resistance in humans and animals need collaboration among the responsibility of all three parts; human health, animal health and environmental health-communities. Surveillance of antimicrobial usage and resistance provides important data for the identification of resistance problems and contributing factors for the development and spread of resistance at a national and local level. Through the painful Korean experience of these zoonotic diseases and global challenge to AMR brings us to establish the effective preventive method and early diagnosis as critical control strategies. Prevention and control of infections is essential in fighting antimicrobial resistance. Thus, to minimize infections in animal and human and to decrease the volume of antimicrobials used, collaborative efforts should be implemented to improve animal and human health.",

In Bangladesh date palm sap is collected from date palm trees for consumption either as fresh or as fermented beverage. The sap is collected in clay pots attached to the top portion of the tree, where the tree has been denuded of bar, so that the sap can ooze overnight into the collection pots. Outbreaks of disease typically occur in the winter months, the interval in which date palm sap is collected. As well, case-control studies have identified consumption of date palm sap beverage as a risk factor at the individual level. Videos using infrared cameras have documented that fruit bats visit date palm trees at night and contaminate the collection pots by licking the oozing sap and by urinating in the collection pots. Ethnographic studies of affected populations has enabled development of a behavior change intervention to reduce consumption of date palm sap. In addition, bamboo skirts placed around the denuded bark area of the date palm trees and collection pots have been developed to obstruct contamination of collected date palm sap by bat saliva and urine.",

Early studies on hand hygiene improvement in healthcare were focused on single interventions promoting the importance of handwashing and introducing the use of antimicrobial soaps. In 1994, our group in Geneva conducted the first large-scale epidemiological research on hand hygiene, identifying major risk factors for noncompliance and demonstrating the critical role of alcohol-based handrubs (ABHRs) as major system change to replace handwashing with soap and water, while included in a multimodal strategy to change HCW behavior. The strategy combines easy access to ABHR ( proven to bypass the time constraint on HCWs), HCW education, performance monitoring and feedback, reminders in the workplace and institutional safety climate. The strategy (referenced as the \"Geneva Model of hand hygiene promotion) was proven successful, and hand hygiene improvement was associated with significant reduction in healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and spread of multi-resistant organisms. Between 2000 and 2006, the \"Geneva Model of hand hygiene promotion\" was replicated in single, as well as multiple healthcare institutions, at local, regional and national level, with success. Since 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) mandated our group to lead the First Global Patient Safety Challenge (Clean Care is Safer Care) with the main objectives to raise awareness about HAI worldwide, mobilize nations toward IPC activities and promote best IPC practices, in particular hand hygiene.

Patterson Professor of Medicine, UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas USA Candidemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality especially in hospitalized and immunocompromised patients. Despite advances in antifungal therapy, the number antifungal drugs and drug classes for treating these serious infectious remains limited. Management is further complicated by the fact that it remains difficult to establish an accurate diagnosis which is compounded by the need for early therapy. Fluconazole remains a useful antifungal agent especially for follow-on therapy after stabilization of infection but resistance is high for some species including C. glabrata. Thus, the echinocandins have become recommended as primary therapy in most patients. However, development of echinocandin drug resistant strains has been reported worldwide. The development of drug resistance has often been tied to antifungal drug use, particularly for some species like Candida glabrata. While multidrug resistance is uncommon, increasing reports of multidrug resistance to the azoles, echinocandins and polyenes have occurred in several Candida species, most notably Candida glabrata and more recently Candida auris. New agents are under development for candidemia, including echinocandins improved pharmacokinetic profiles and those available for oral use. In addition, other agents with new targets of action are also undergoing preclinical development. Diagnosis of infection and detection of antifungal resistance is critical to the successful management of patients with these infections.

We observed significant decrease in HIV-RNA in the 16 mg/kg cohort of KD-247 with two in six cases who achieved >1 log reduction of HIV-RNA. Long-term suppression of viral load was observed for one patient despite significant decrease in plasma concentration of KD-247, suggesting effects of antibody other than neutralization. We previously reported that the neutralization escape mutants to KD-247 became sensitive to chemokine CC receptor (CCR)5 inhibitors such as maraviroc or cenicriviroc. Conversely, resistance mutants to CCR5 inhibitors became sensitive to several neutralizing antibodies including KD-247. Furthermore, a series of in vitro experiments suggested synergistic effects of the combination of KD-247 and CCR5 antagonists including maraviroc (Figure) .

            "text": "Group Cpf1 is a recently reported effector endonuclease protein of the class 2 CRISPR-Cas system. Cpf1 has several differences from Cas9: cleavage with 5' overhangs, shorter guide RNA, and a longer distance between the seed sequence and cleavage site, which could provide potential advantages for some cases of genome editing such as nonhomologous end joining-based gene insertion and efficient genome editing using homology-directed repair. However, limited information is available about Cpf1 activity profiles in mammalian cells, precluding its wide use for genome editing. Furthermore, both selection of highly efficient guide RNAs and collection of big data for determination of parameters of RNA-programmable nucleases are currently laborious and costly due to lack of a reliable high-throughput approach to determine RNAprogrammable nuclease activity in mammalian cells. Here, we performed en masse evaluation of guide RNA and Cpf1 activity using synthetic target sequences and deep sequencing. Using this in vivo high-throughput approach, we determined on-and off-target activity profiles and protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences of Cpf1. We found that sequence features of high activity AsCpf1 guide RNAs are distinct from those of SpCas9 and that the PAM of As and LbCpf1 in mammalian cells is TTTV, rather than TTTN, which was previously determined using an in vitro system. Evaluation of off-target activity showed that Cpf1 target sequences can be divided into three regions: a 6 base pair (bp) seed, a 13 bp trunk, and a 6 bp promiscuous region. These results should serve as a useful guide to select Cpf1 as a genome editing tool. More importantly, our in vivo high-throughput evaluation system will greatly facilitate both the selection of efficient and precise guide RNAs and the generation of big data for the development of advanced prediction programs for on-and off-target activities. TasP works if an infected person knows his/her HIV status. A diagnosis should have been made as early as possible, and treatment offered promptly, so that the time gap between infection and viral suppression can be narrowed. Around the world, late diagnosis is still common. Early diagnosis often hinges not just on easy access to voluntary testing, freedom from stigma, but also the availability of screening. Selftesting and the submission of specimens (urine, saliva, dried blood spots) for laboratory testing are some solutions, albeit the existence of technical problems, and the need for establishing linkage to care. Periodic testing campaigns could impact HIV epidemiology, as illustrated in our modelling study parametrized by Hong Kong's surveillance data. For patients enrolled in treatment programs, optimization of regimen is crucial to ensure lifelong maintenance of HAART without adverse reactions. In the developed world, integrase inhibitor is now used in first-line regimens, which has the capacity of reducing viral load to undetectable range within weeks. Their access and that of single tablet regimens, are however limited in places where most HIV patients are. For some antiretrovirals, for example abacavir and efavirenz, knowledge of the host genotype (HLA-B5701 and CYP2B6-516GT respectively) could minimize the occurrence of adverse reactions which might otherwise compromise adherence. Notably adherence is the key to lifelong maintenance of virus suppression, and there is no simple solution to guarantee adherence over years, or tens of years.",

Except for a small number of cases presenting as acute infection, the seroconversion time is often unknown. Using modified back calculation methods to estimate the seroconversion year of over 3,000 patients in Hong Kong, we found that the interquartile range of their underdiagnosed intervals was 1-4 years with a range between 0 and 10 years. The lengths of undiagnosed intervals were associated with age and the routes of HIV transmission. Obviously people with low perceived risk of HIV infection had longer undiagnosed interval and were more likely to be late for diagnosis. From mathematical modelling, increase of undiagnosed intervals would offset infections averted by TasP even if good coverage and high adherence were assumed. Apparently, TasP is a necessary yet insufficient intervention to achieve HIV elimination. TasP targets people infected with HIV, whereas interventions for non-infected individuals would contribute to the reduction of the size of populations requiring TasP. One good example of the latter is pre-exposure prophylaxis, but it's only accessible to handfuls of people at risk around the world. Effective protocols are needed, and risk compensation is a new concern. Let's not forget promotion of protected sex, provision of methadone maintenance (and other harm reduction measures) for injection drug users, and community-level behavioral interventions.

Overall, HCAIs remain one of the key challenges of hospital care and significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality. Papers published in the last 2 years remind us that further reductions of HCAI rates are possibleoften with the help of simple and rather inexpensive interventions. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is critical for the effective treatment of life threatening infections, such as bloodstream, respiratory tract and complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). These clinical syndromes are difficult to diagnose due to complex aetiology and challenging clinical sample types (e.g. blood, sputum). Current culture based diagnosis often has sub-optimal specificity and sensitivity and is too slow to impact on patient management. Shotgun metagenomics sequencing has the potential to change the way we diagnose infection, combining rapidity with comprehensiveness beyond that of current methods.

Due to these features, ARSs are the first to be exposed to broad spectrum of stresses and challenges. In fact, they have shown diverse roles as rapid responding signal mediators beyond protein synthesis. Here we show our recent findings on ARSs as primary defense system against bacterial and viral infections. For instance, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WRS), is rapidly secreted out from monocytes upon bacterial infection and primes innate immune responses. The secretion was far more rapid than the induction of innate immune system. In another case, glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) plays a unique role in viral clearance. EPRS blocks PCBP2mediated ubiquitination of MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein), leading to the inhibition of viral replication.

The ESRC Working Group on AMR Report 2014 stated that although AMR involves biological processes, the context which determines the operation of these biological mechanisms is shaped by social, cultural, political, and economic processes. 1",

The contribution of behavioural science in improving antibiotic stewardship is crucial but has only been recognized lately. 2 Antibiotic prescribing is a complex behaviour, carried out by an informed individual often making a subjectively rational choice. A recent report by the Department of Health and Public Health England summarised the evidence on behavioural change and antibiotic prescribing in healthcare settings. It pointed out the lack of underpinning psychological theory and behavioural science in most of the studies which have been done so far. 3 As a result interventions may not be effective in changing behavior.",

A combination of enhanced infection control and antimicrobial stewardship is often recommended to combat antimicrobial resistance in hospitals. Multiple strategies are recommended by professional societies for antimicrobial stewardship, with differing levels of evidence and effectiveness. Several recent well conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that antimicrobial stewardship is effective in reducing broadspectrum antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance without increasing adverse clinical outcomes. Restrictive strategies produce more immediate effects but persuasive strategies are associated with more sustained impact. In addition to commonly adopted strategies of pre-authorization and prospective review and feedback, a greater variety of antimicrobial stewardship interventions are now recommended. In particular, evidence-based clinical care paths for common infections are associated with improved mortality. However antimicrobial use in hospitals is part of the greater context of antimicrobial use and resistance within the One Health continuum.

A myriad of new technologies are in use or under development, including matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), rapid multiplex (i.e., panel) nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), point-of-care microbiology NAATs, and rapid phenotypic bacterial susceptibility testing, to name a few. These technologies provide new tools to combat antimicrobial resistance, which is especially important in an era of rising resistance. Today, there is increased use of unneeded broad spectrum therapy because of the need to address the possibility of resistance until such a time as results of conventional diagnostic tests are available. This situation can potentially be ameliorated by more rapid diagnostics. In addition, over-prescription of antibacterial agents in general can potentially be addressed by rapid tests which exclude the need to prescribe antibacterial agents in the first place. An overview of new rapid diagnostics for infectious diseases that can potentially help combat antimicrobial resistance will be presented.Ideal new diagnostics are more rapid, less expensive, and more accurate than existing diagnostics. Unfortunately, not all new diagnostics meet all these criteria, with cost often being high. To address this situation, outcomes studies evaluating new diagnostics have assumed an important role. Outcomes that should be addressed include antibiotic and further test avoidance, patient outcomes (e.g., length of stay, morbidity, mortality), patient and provider satisfaction, and infection transmission. Results of outcomes studies then need to be used to inform the development of practice guidelines for use of these tests (which may vary from practice-to-practice) and also to inform ideal reconfiguration/development of tests by diagnostics companies. Our experience with a recent randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating a rapid multiplex NAAT for testing positive blood culture bottles will be presented.It is an exciting time for diagnostics, with new technologies and opportunities for studies to determine how best to use these technologies in patient care.",

Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, KoreaSepsis is a significant syndrome in medicine and one of a major contributing cause of death world-widely.Prompt recognition and aggressive management is the key element of improving survival from this brutal disease. Unfortunately, sepsis is very complex immunologic event according to etiology and individuals' characteristics. As a result, a degree of organ dysfunction result from sepsis, an effect of protocolized treatment, and outcome could not be same.Resuscitation with fluid and vasopressors is an initial and essential treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock. Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) continues to revise the treatment guideline and the initial steps for treatment are converged to use crystalloid fluid and use norepinephrine to whom do not respond to fluid therapy. In 2001, Rivers et al suggested protocolized quantitative resuscitation method, otherwise known as early goal-directed therapy (EGDT). This method was attractive in hospital settings because of clear notification of parameters, target, and drugs. The uncertainty of the effect of the individual component of bundle approach in treating severe sepsis/septic shock has been debated and EGDT has been challenged following the failure to show a mortality reduction in subsequent large multicenter randomized controlled trials. Effective fluid resuscitation means an effective restoration of tissue perfusion. Although mean arterial pressure (MAP) can be a representative marker of tissue perfusion, central venous pressure (CVP) and serum lactic acid do not. As you already know, we do not have precise parameters of individual patient's hemodynamic status and also evaluating an effect of therapy we do. What is the proper volume of resuscitating fluid and how to monitor are also important issues we should have interest? Although the crystalloid fluid is recommended as an initial therapy of resuscitation, the benefit, and harm of colloidal fluid, and alternative fluid is still evaluating.Vasopressor therapy is needed to who do not respond fluid resuscitation. But there are many unresolved questions such as target MAP, optimal timing, and duration. Norepinephrine has been recommended since the first SSC guideline, because more potent and effective at reversing hypotension, and less adverse events compared to dopamine. Epinephrine and vasopressin are regarded as next-line or partner drug with norepinephrine. The effect of other vasopressors such as angiotensin II and endothelin-1 are evaluating.Medical experience clearly says that fluid resuscitation and vasopressor are very essential and initial element to improve the survival of the sepsis and septic shock patients. But we do not exactly know how to do accurately and properly. I will briefly present the current consensus and controversies about fluid resuscitation, monitoring of patient's hemodynamics, and use of vasopressors in septic patients in this lecture. The antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) is recognized as the most important tool for proper use of antibiotics. However, in order to properly implement ASP, systematic training and tools are needed for medical staff prescribing antibiotics.Basic education consists of face-to-face training for medical staffs. However, face-to-face education alone is difficult to maximize its effectiveness. When medical staffs prescribe, a variety of tools are being used to prescribe antibiotics properly.The most basic program is the antibiotic prescription restriction program. This program is a system that antibiotics which can only be used for certain resistant strains in hospitals are used with the permission of an antibiotic manager (usually an infectious diseases specialist).Most hospitals in Korea with infectious diseases specialists have this system. The Infectious disease division of Hallym Universuty Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital have a list of restricted antibiotics that contain vancomycin, linezolid, carbapenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, tigecycline, liposomal amphotericin B, echinocandin, voriconazole as restricted antibiotics.Since the 2000s, antibiotic prescription programs have been introduced in Korea and used in various hospitals. The purpose of this program is to recommend appropriate antibiotics according to the impression at the time of admission to the patient. When the causative bacteria are cultured, they help to prescribe appropriate antimicrobial agents according to the cultures. Advanced programs automatically adjust the antibiotic dose according to the renal function. The number of antibiotic doses is also automatically recommended. When antibiotics need to be mixed with other solutions, it is automatically recommended that the solutions be mixed.Currently, these antibiotic prescription programs have begun to apply the learning function of artificial intelligence and recommend antibiotics that frequently used depending on the name of diagnosis. If you are using antibiotics which could be expected to be drug interactions, you can also show alarms via pop-ups.In 2016, the Korean Society for Chemotherapy developed a mobile app to help prescribe antibiotics. From 2017 to 2018, the Korean Society of Chemotherapy and Korea CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) are conducting this project together. The antibiotic program is a collaborative project with hospital and clinic antibiotic prescription programs.This lecture will discuss antibiotic prescription programs used in Korea and discuss the developmental direction of this program.",
