With experience of both muscle spindle electrophysiology and intensive care medicine, in 1973 he started collaborating with Ricardo Miledi at the University College London in work on myasthenia gravis (MG). The discovery of antibodies to acetylcholine receptors in serum of these patients by Jon Lindstrom and colleagues, and the demonstration of passive transfer of disease to mice by injection of patients' IgG by Klaus Toyka and Dan Drachman, led JND to test the effects of plasma exchange as a treatment. The remarkable efficacy of this therapywhich lasted for several weeksshowed convincingly that myasthenia was indeed caused by humoral immunity. The discoveries that followed in JND's and others' laboratories owe much to the implications of this simple clinical experiment. Over the next 20 years, he and his team in London and then Oxford systematically investigated the role of the thymus and involvement of T cell immunity in MG, defined the existence of humoral immunity to voltage-gated calcium channels in the Lambert Eaton syndrome, and showed similarly that some cases of acquired neuromyotonia were associated with antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC).",

            "text": "Josep Dalmau, MD, PhD Limbic encephalitis refers to an inflammatory process involving the hippocampi, amygdala and less frequently frontobasal and insular regions. This disorder used to be considered extremely rare, invariably associated with cancer, and unresponsive to treatment. However, recent studies indicate that limbic encephalitis is more frequent than previously thought, and a substantial number of patients may recover. This increased recognition of limbic encephalitis is due in part to the development of clinical diagnostic criteria and the identification of antibodies directed against two broad categories of antigens: 1) intracellular or classical paraneoplastic antigens, including Hu, Ma2, and CV2/CRMP5, among others, and 2) cell surface antigens including, voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), and others expressed in the neuropil of the hippocampus. While the disorders related to the first category of antibodies associate with cancer (lung, testis and other), prominent brain infiltrates of T-cells, and limited response to treatment, the disorders related to the second category of antibodies associate less frequently with tumors, appear to be antibody-mediated, and respond better to immunotherapy. While studying limbic encephalitis, we identified a large group of allied disorders in which the limbic system is often involved, but other areas of the brain are also affected. Of particular interest is the disorder that associates with antibodies to extracellular epitopes of NR1/NR2 heteromers of the NMDA receptor. Patients with this syndrome are often young women with ovarian teratoma, although the disorder can also affect men and children with or without tumors. Most patients present with severe psychiatric symptoms and are first seen by psychiatrists. Subsequently patients develop seizures, dyskinesias, autonomic instability or hypoventilation. There is a correlation between antibody titers and outcome. The antibodies are directed against the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, differentiating this disease from a number of disorders attributed to antibodies against NR2 subunits. In vitro studies indicate that patients' NR1 antibodies can modulate the number of NMDA receptors. There are other autoimmune encephalitides for which the target antigens are on the cell surface of neurons and neuronal processes of the hippocampus. The phenotype of these patients is different from that of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and resembles more a classical limbic encephalitis with frequent relapsing-remitting seizures and memory deficits. Work in progress suggests that the autoantigens are ion channels or receptors critically involved in processes of learning and memory. In all, the study of these disorders provides a link between immunologic processes and neuronal events involved in memory, cognition, seizures, and neuronal degeneration.",

However, these plasma cells stained with the specific marker CD138 were confined to the perivascular spaces and were not found in the brain parenchyma. In multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, cells in the brain parenchyma, considered to be plasma cells, contain subplasmalemmal linear densities (SPLDs) and are frequently binucleate. Both these features are not present in plasma cells. Instead, these cells could be plasmacytoid cells, which are the precursors of epithelioid cells in sarcoidosis and have also been found to contain SPLDs. In sarcoidosis, giant cells due to fusion are common, so that the binucleate cells in MS could also arise by cell fusion rather than division. The plasmacytoid cell has now been identified as a type of dendritic cell. These cells are increased tenfold in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with early MS.",

If confirmed, a specific non-myelin autoantigen may be implicated in the pathogenesis of MS. Furthermore, as these plasmacytoid dendritic cells secrete large amounts of interferon alpha, this cytokine could cause axonal damage in MS patients. The implication of CD8 T cells in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal models is increasingly being appraised. CD8 T cells in the central nervous system (CNS) of MS patients have been shown to be highly activated with an effector memory phenotype. Contribution of CNS factors to the acquisition of such phenotype by CD8 T cells has not been elucidated. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is crucial for the generation and maintenance of memory CD8 T cells. IL-15 produced by cells in the tissue microenvironment of other inflammatory diseases has been revealed as a potent activator of infiltrating CD8 T cells leading to an enhanced cytotoxicity towards target cells. Our goals are i) to investigate whether IL-15 is present in the CNS in the context of MS ii) to determine whether IL-15 in situ can enhance deleterious CD8 T cell responses against CNS target cells thus contributing to the observed tissue damage.",

Upon co-culture with activated astrocytes, CD8 T cells acquired an effector memory phenotype with increased perforin and granzyme B levels (flow cytometry). Moreover, these CD8 T cells were more cytotoxic towards primary cultures of human adult oligodendrocytes (51Cr release). These astrocyte-mediated functional enhancements of CD8 T cell function were all abrogated by anti-IL-15 blocking antibodies.

IL-15 bioavailability in the CNS may be implicated in the exacerbation of tissue damage targeting oligodendrocytes during MS pathogenesis.

Although anti-Aquaporin (AQP) 4 antibody can differentiate NMO from MS clinically, the possible link between the two demyelinating diseases remains a mystery.

Such autoimmune dynamic was stable and obtained in a wide range of parameters close to the normal functioning of the immune system. In addition, we found that stochastic stimulation of the immune system strongly influences the timing at which relapses appear, preventing their prediction. We also found some unexpected predictions because the increase in the activity of effector T-cells in some circumstances generates a strong control response that prevents the presence of relapses. Finally, we introduced perturbations into the model mimicking immunotherapies aimed to increase the activity of either effector or regulatory T-cells. We demonstrate that the effect of such therapies was highly dependent on the timing and the underlying dynamic of the immune system, implying that immunotherapies must be developed in a personalized manner and focused in obtaining a healthier dynamic in the control module of the peripheral tolerance, more than in keeping the absolute number of T-cells in certain ranges.",

Moreover, in helminth-infected MS patients TLR-2 engagement induced preferential expansion of IL-10 secreting B cells in a MyD88-dependent manner. To examine whether this differential activation of regulatory B cells had an impact on T cell immune responses, B cells previously stimulated with TLR-2 ligands were cocultured with allogenic CD4+ FoxP3-T cells, and examined by flow cytometry for FoxP3 expression and IL-17 and IFN-gamma production. TLR-2 stimulated B cells were highly efficient in inducing FoxP3 expression on alloreactive T cells, converting over 50% to FoxP3 positivity, whereas TLR-4, TLR-5 and TLR9 engagements did not alter FoxP3 expression. Likewise, following TLR-2 stimulation, B cells induced the generation of IL-10 producing FoxP3-Tr1 cells. Moreover, the percentage of CD4+ T cells expressing IFN-gamma and IL-17 was significantly lower in cultures containing B cells stimulated with TLR-2 agonists, compared to those activated via TLR-4, TLR-5 or TLR-9.

It was postulated that because of molecular mimicry with cross-reacting and yet undefined epitopes, autoreactive T cells are activated, peripheral tolerance is broken, and disease is initiated or reactivated. The immune impairment of MS is extremely complex. Because the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway was shown to be associated with the production of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10, an impairment in these molecules could be associated with the development of MS.

School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Dublin, Ireland MS patients treated with IFN beta have been reported to have reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN gamma and increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10. However, the precise mechanism of action of IFN beta is unclear. Antigen presenting cells, particularly dendritic cells (DC), play a crucial role in directing T cell responses via the production of regulatory cytokines including the IL-12 family members and IL-10. IL-12 promotes the induction of IFN gamma-secreting T helper (Th) 1 cells, whereas IL-10 promotes the development of IL-10-secreting regulatory T cells. Recently, the IL-12 family member IL-23, together with IL-6 and IL-1, has been shown to promote the development of Th17 cells, which have been demonstrated to play a pathogenic role in autoimmune disorders. A protective role for IL-27, another IL-12 family member, has been demonstrated in the experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) model, where it antagonises the induction of Th17 cells by up-regulating IL-10.

Tissue damage was prevented by decreasing the amount of axonal damage as quantified by confocal microscopy of labelled axons. Finally, we found no toxicity at any of the doses tested.",

The prediction was that the cytokine domain would bind the respective cytokine receptors on antigen presenting cells (APC) and simultaneously promote anti-inflammatory or tolerogenic activity by those APC while targeting the NAg domain to the class II MHC antigen processing pathway for enhanced presentation. The targeted presentation of NAg by these cytokine-conditioned APC would predictably inhibit NAg-specific T cells that interacted with those APC. These fusion proteins were expressed, purified, and subcutaneously administered in saline to test for inhibition of EAE. Three different cytokine-NAg fusion proteins were potent inhibitors of EAE. These fusion proteins incorporated the IL-2 cytokine as the N-terminal domain (the IL2NAg fusion protein), the secreted IL-16 cytokine as the C-terminal domain (the NAgIL16 fusion protein), or the IFN-beta cytokine as the N-terminal domain (IFNbetaNAg fusion protein). These fusion proteins were administered to rats once per week for a total of three injections over 3 weeks. Then at least one week later, rats were challenged with NAg in CFA to induce EAE. Compared to NAg alone, these fusion proteins strongly attenuated the subsequent active induction of EAE. These fusion proteins also inhibited EAE when administered after encephalitogenic challenge during onset of EAE.

Pharmacol. 69: [1579] [1580] [1581] [1582] [1583] [1584] [1585] [1586] [1587] 2006) . We have also demonstrated that celecoxib inhibits EAE by a COX-2-independent mechanism (Brain 129: 1984 (Brain 129: -1992 (Brain 129: , 2006 ) that is mediated by downregulation of cytokines, adhesion factors and chemokines. In the present study, we have analysed the mode of action of TMF-celecoxib in more detail and have, as well, assessed its effect in the EAE model.",

A comprehensive analysis of 25 ERresident chaperones/foldases and associated co-factors showed that TMF-celecoxib induces significant transcriptional upregulation of GRP78, DNAJB9, ERO1LB and HERPUD1. HERPUD1 is part of a molecular mass protein complex involved in retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins prior to degradation. Further experiments using siRNA \"knockdown\" as well as immunoprecipitation of selected ER chaperones reveal a picture of multiple chaperone interactions involved in ER retention of these cytokines by TMF-celecoxib. We have also for the first time assessed the efficacy of TMF-celecoxib in EAE. TMF-celecoxib appeared to decrease the clinical score, and its effect was indistinguishable from celecoxib. Further analysis is being performed to assess its effect on IL-12, IL-23, IFN-gamma and IL-17 secretion in the EAE model. TMF-celecoxib may constitute the first drug for treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, that works through a mechanism disrupting cytokine folding in the ER. Its total lack of COX-2 inhibitory activity is beneficial, since inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis has been associated with deleterious alterations in endothelial cells, potentially contributing to development of cardiac events. Multiple sclerosis is the most common demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Though the etiologic agent of MS is still unknown, epidemiologic data suggest that an environmental agent, such as a virus, may initiate the disease. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a murine picornavirus that induces a demyelinating disease in susceptible strains of mice when injected intracranially. Theiler's virusinduced demyelination (TVID) lesions are similar to those seen in MS patients. Thus, TVID is a valuable animal model for the study of MS. Currently, interferon-beta (IFNB) is a major treatment option for MS patients. Unfortunately, IFNB treatment is not successful in all MS patients and often produces undesirable side effects. Thus, the search for alternative therapies is an area of intense investigation within the field of MS. Interferon tau (IFNT) is a Type I IFN produced in ruminants during pregnancy that is less cytotoxic than IFNB, but equally effective for immunomodulation. Cross-species reactivity of IFNT is key to its use as a treatment for human immune-mediated diseases, such as MS. The therapeutic potential of oral IFNT in the treatment of MS is now being assessed in Stage III clinical trials. The objectives of this study were to test the ability of IFNT to ameliorate TVID and to elucidate mechanisms of immunomodulation.",

Sema4D-deficient mice are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Another semaphorin, Sema4A provides a costimulatory signals to T cells and has a non-redundant role in the regulation of Th1/Th2 responses. Treatment of mice with anti-Sema4A antibody inhibited the development of EAE. Thus semaphorins have significant roles in the peripheral immune systems in pathological conditions such as EAE. However, it is unclear whether semaphorins are related with immune responses in the other systems such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or the central nervous systems (CNS). Here we investigate the expression of a semaphorin in the CNS of EAE and its relevance to the BBB. EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with MOG35-55 peptide and spinal cords of the mice were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. The semaphorin is expressed in the infiltrating cells around the meninges in the spinal cord of EAE. Some of the cells expressing semaphorin were lymphocytes and the others were presumably macrophages. The plexin, one of the candidate receptors for the semaphorin, was expressed in lectin-positive cells which were supposed to be microglia and endothelial cells (ECs). From this expression pattern, we considered the possibility that the semaphorin is associated with immune cell trafficking through BBB. In the analysis in vitro, the semaphorin enhanced the expression of adhesion molecules on ECs.",

ADAM-17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) is the principal convertase of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which is a major immunomodulatory cytokine. In addition, ADAM-17 also cleaves a number of other membrane-bound proteins, including the chemokine and adhesion molecule, fractalkine (CX3CL1), which has been implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. ADAM-17 expression in endothelial cells in MS white matter and in the spinal cord of rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has been shown by our laboratory to be up-regulated. Here we studied the in vitro expression of ADAM-17, its inhibitor (TIMP-3), and fractalkine in a human brain endothelial cell  line, hCMEC/D3, at the mRNA and protein level under pro-inflammatory  conditions. ADAM-17, TIMP-3 and fractalkine were up-regulated at the mRNA level under TNF treatment, however, only fractalkine was significantly so. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that this increase in fractalkine expression also occurred at the protein level. To determine the shedding activities of ADAM-17 we then performed an ELISA assay. Cells treated with TNF at 100 ng/ml released 775.7 ng fractalkine/mg protein, which is 10 times greater than the amount of fractalkine bound to the cell membrane under the same conditions. We then sought to determine the protein expression of ADAM-17 following TNF treatment. A significant increase in ADAM-17 protein expression could not be determined using either immunocytochemistry, or western blotting and densitometry. We thus hypothesize that the increased shedding of fractalkine is due to increased enzyme activity of ADAM-17 and not increased protein expression of the protease. Activity assays for ADAM-17 under pro-inflammatory conditions using an InnozymeTM activity kit are ongoing to test this hypothesis. We are also investigating the immunohistochemical co-localisation and expression levels of ADAM-17 and fractalkine in MS and control brain tissue. The extent of associated inflammatory, demyelinated and neurodegenerative processes within the tissue is assessed in parallel.",

The levels of CXCL10 were significantly higher in the CSF of RRMS patients both during relapse (298.2 \u00b1 143.8 pg/ml) and stable phase of the disease (323.7 \u00b1 183 pg/ml) in comparison with the control group (152.4 \u00b1 97.7 pg/ml, p b 0.001). The CSF levels of CCL5 were significantly higher in patients with relapses in comparison with stable RRMS, p b 0.005. The CXCL11 levels did not differ significantly from control values. There was no effect of MP therapy on the serum levels of CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL11.",

Expression of the chemokine CCL2 has been demonstrated within active lesions in MS, but not in control brain. A low percentage of T cells and the majority of peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid monocytes express CCR2, the receptor for CCL2. CCL2 is thus considered to play a key role in the recruitment of PBMCs at the BBB in MS. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMPs 2 and 9, are involved in MS pathogenesis, including BBB disruption, and are colocalised with CCL2 in CNS inflammatory lesions. MMPs can cleave chemokines, thereby altering their activity. We investigated processing of CCL2 by MMPs 2 and 9, and the effects on chemotactic activity. Effects of in vivo immunomodulatory treatment on PBMC migration in response to CCL2 are currently under investigation, and will demonstrate whether drug treatment has specific effects which could be further influenced by truncation of CCL2.",

Genome architectural features consisting of low-copy repeats (LCRs), also called segmental duplications, can stimulate and mediate NAHR. There are positional hotspots for the crossovers within the LCRs. We recently elucidated a DNA replication mechanism for nonrecurrent rearrangements that we termed FoSTeS -Fork Stalling and Template Switching. Rearrangements introduce variation into our genome for selection to act upon and as such serve an evolutionary function analogous to base pair changes. Genomic rearrangements may cause Mendelian diseases, complex traits such as behavioral and psychiatric traits (e.g. autism, schizophrenia), or represent benign polymorphic variations. The latter copy number variations (CNVs) are ubiquitous in the human genome. In fact, any two humans contain more base-pair differences due to structural variation of the genome than resulting from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). The mechanisms by which rearrangements convey phenotypes are diverse and include gene dosage, position effects, unmasking of coding region mutations (cSNPs) or other functional SNPs, creating gain-of-function fusion genes or loss of function gene mutations at the breakpoints, and perhaps through effects of transvection. De novo genomic rearrangements have been shown to cause both chromosomal and Mendelian disease, as well as sporadic traits, but our understanding of the extent to which genomic rearrangements, gene CNV, and/or gene dosage alterations are responsible for common and complex traits remains rudimentary. During cellular differentiation, both permissive and repressive epigenetic modifications must be negotiated to create cell-type specific gene expression patterns. At cell fate decision checkpoints, dynamic developmental decisions are made to establish specific epigenetic patterns, but the mechanisms by which these heritable states are created, especially the loss of repressive methyl marks, have been elusive. The Tbox transcription factor family is critically important in several developmental systems ranging from embryogenesis to the differentiation of adult tissues. In the immune system, the T-box factors T-bet and Eomes are responsible for cellular differentiation events in several cell types, most notably Th1 cell differentiation. We have explored the mechanisms by which developmentally important transcription factors contribute to the establishment of epigenetic patterns by utilizing T-bet as a model. A comprehensive mutagenesis study surprisingly suggested that in addition to DNA binding, the highly conserved T-box domain is responsible for recruiting chromatin-modifying activities to target gene promoters. By examining point mutations known to be responsible for several different human genetic diseases found within the T-box factors Tbx3, Tbx5, Tbx20, Tbx22 and T-pit, we have found that two distinct surfaces of the T-box domain recruit chromatin-modifying activities to promoters and are required for the functional activation of T-bet target genes. Our data suggest that T-bet is required and sufficient to alleviate repressive H3K27 methylation marks and that this is mediated through a functional interaction with the demethylase JMJD3. After repressive modifications are removed, a permissive chromatin environment is created by the T-box dependent recruitment of an H3K4 methyltransferase to the target genes. Collectively, the data suggest that the ability of the T-box DNA binding domain to functionally establish the epigenetic state of its target genes is required for its ability to initiate cell-type specific developmental gene expression patterns. Characterization of encephalitogenic T cells is critical for identifying therapeutic targets for multiple sclerosis (MS). To this end, we have used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to suppress molecules expressed by encephalitogenic T cells to determine if the molecule is essential for immune-mediated demyelinating disease. Using a siRNA specific for T-bet, a transcription factor, we found T-bet to be critical for the differentiation and effector function of encephalitogenic T cells. Systemic administration of T-bet specific siRNA inhibites the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and treatment of established EAE with this siRNA ameliorates disease. We found that the interferon-\u03b3, STAT1, and IL-23 receptor genes are all directly regulated by T-bet. In addition, the pathogenic capacity of both myelin-specific Th1 and Th17 cells is greatly diminished when T-bet is suppressed. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of myelin-specific Th1 cells results in the generation of host-derived Th17 cells found only in the CNS. Thus, it appears that the CNS is a conducive environment for the differentiation of Th17 cells. However, systemic administration of T-bet siRNA following adoptive transfer of Th1 cells prevents the generation of Th17 cells in the CNS, indicating that T-bet plays a role in the differentiation of Th17 cells. In addition, myelin-specific T cells from mice with spontaneous EAE fail to transfer EAE if T-bet is suppressed, confirming a critical role for T-bet in spontaneous autoimmune demyelinating disease. In an effort to determine the role of myelin-specific Th17 cells in pathogenesis, we have found Th17 cells differentiated in vitro with IL-6+TGF\u03b2 do not transfer EAE and are a distinct population from the pathogenic Th17 cells generated in vivo. This data suggest that T-bet may be a viable therapeutic target for MS, capable of suppressing both Th1 and Th17 cells.",

            "text": "The intestinal mucosa forms the largest body surface exposed to exogenous antigens, both innocuous and pathogenic non-self antigens. Consistent with chronic antigen exposure, the gut mucosa also lodges a large collection of activated lymphocytes that under physiological conditions remain in an immune quiescent state. This so-called \"gut physiological inflammation\" is controlled by distinct regulatory mechanisms, including different types of regulatory DCs and T cells. An important molecule in this context is TGF-\u03b2, abundantly produced in the gut and crucial for both systemic and mucosal immune-regulation. Among multiple roles, TGF-\u03b2 has the capacity to block Th1 and Th2 differentiation and to convert na\u00efve CD4 cells into Foxp3-expressing induced Treg cells. Paradoxically, TGF-\u03b2 also displays pro-inflammatory roles and in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-21, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF, TGF-\u03b2 promotes the conversion of na\u00efve T cells into effector Th17 cells. This contrasting deviation puts TGF-\u03b2 as a principal controller of immune responses and underscores a central role of this cytokine in orchestrating the pro-and anti-inflammatory nature of adaptive immunity. Nowhere else is a critical regulation of this balance between productive and suppressive immunity, of more significance that at the mucosal surface of the gut where efficient immune protection against pathogens has to coincide with maintenance of the mucosal barrier integrity and selftolerance as well as tolerance towards the vast load of harmless nonself antigens derived from food and beneficial commensal bacteria. We identified a metabolite of the nutrient vitamin A, retinoic acid, as a key regulator of TGF-\u03b2-dependent immune responses, capable of inhibiting the IL-6-driven induction of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and promoting the peripheral differentiation of anti-inflammatory Foxp3 + induced Tregs. This intestinal induced regulatory mechanism allows for environmental factors to control aberrant endogenous immune responses from the outside in. The induced immune tolerance is not irreversible however and in the presence of innate danger signals retinoic acid effects condense or synergize with innate responses to promote or enhance protective immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen presenting cells that influence the activities of all types of lymphocytes, including B, NK and T cells. Two main pathways of DC development are recognized: 1) the myeloid DCs (mDCs) with two unique subsets: Langerhans cells and interstitial DCs; and 2) the plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), a main source of the antiviral and immunomodulatory type 1 interferons. Subsets of DCs display unique combinations of surface markers, such as lectins, that endow them with distinct phenotypes and functions. DCs also are an unavoidable target in the prevention, treatment and development of disease. In the settings of infection and cancer, microbes and tumors can exploit DCs to evade immunity, but DCs also can generate resistance, a capacity that is readily enhanced with DC-targeted vaccines. In the context of patient care, DCs are providing new approaches to disease pathogenesis and therapy. In particular it is clear that DCs play a critical role in the process of vaccination. To address this, we are exploring new vaccine designs that harness DCs. In cancer, DCs are generated ex vivo by culturing either blood monocytes or bone marrow progenitor cells with cytokine combinations. These DCs are then loaded with tumor antigens in different forms and injected back into the patients. This has resulted in the induction of clear tumorspecific immune responses as well as clinical responses. We are expanding this strategy to other cancer types as well as to infectious diseases, such as HIV. Novel strategies have been proposed to directly target the antigens to DCs in vivo. Multiple DC surface molecules have been considered as targets, as they need to allow internalization of the antigen cargo and its processing for presentation on both MHC class I and class II molecules. We are characterizing DC subsets that may be effective targets for anti-DC antibodies. These antibodies can be fused to antigens and carry them directly to the desired DCs for maximum immune response against a variety of infectious diseases.",

In the context of MS and its animal model EAE, the precise function and phenotype of the encephalitogenic disease-mediating T cell remains elusive. For more than 10 years, the cytokine secretion profile of effector TH cells divided them into TH1 and TH2 cells and \"immune deviation\" from pathogenic TH1 to regulatory TH2 cells was widely held to be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of MS. This paradigm was dismantled when it was discovered that IL-23 rather than its TH1 inducing sister cytokine IL-12 is essential for the development of autoimmune disease. IL-23 was demonstrated to drive the expression of IL-17 in TH cells and the term TH17 cells was coined. The clear association of this newly described T H 17 phenotype with autoimmune pathogenicity now implicates T H 17 cytokines as critical mediators of chronic autoimmune diseases. However, this notion relies almost exclusively on correlations and associations and a causative link between TH17 cytokines and pathogenicity has yet to be made. In order to study the actual function of TH17 cytokines in the context of autoimmunity in vivo, we generated a number of transgenic and gene-targeted mice and discovered that the current notion of the pathogenic TH17 cells is again far too simplistic and erroneous. I will discuss that TH17 cytokines, while clearly associated with pathogenicity, do not or only marginally contribute to the development of autoimmune CNS-disease and that the master cytokine IL-23 drives pathogenicity independent of TH17 polarization. B cell contribution to MS pathophysiology has generally been considered based on their potential to react to particular CNS antigens and produce CNS-directed autoantibodies. The presence of abnormal CSF immunoglobulin (Ig) with typical oligoclonal band (OCB) pattern, pathologic features of demyelinating lesions and molecular analyses of B cell lineagetogether have implicated contribution of CNSspecific antibodies in MS (e.g. complement-mediated injury, antibody-directed cytotoxicity (ADCC). While elegant approaches have confirmed that at least a portion of the CNS Ig bind myelin targets, it remains unclear whether all CNS antibodies directly contribute to pathogenesis, are generated as a consequence of tissue injury, or represent epiphenomenon of active CNS inflammation. Certain CNSdirected antibodies may actually be beneficial such as through the support of remyelination, or by helping to remove debris including growth inhibitory molecules such as Nogo, thereby providing a more permissive environment for axonal regeneration.",

Distinct B cell subsets have been identified that function as effective APC to T cells and normal human B cells are now recognized to actively contribute to the regulation of immune responses in part through secretion of distinct effector cytokine profiles in a context-dependent fashion. In some patients with MS, chronically activated B cells have been described in structures reminiscent of germinal centers that may affect the CNS independent of T cells as well as promote ongoing T cell activation and propagation of the MS disease activity. A deficiency in the ability of MS patient B cells to produce the downregulatory cytokine IL-10 has been reported, implicating them directly in the dysregulated MS immune process. Promising results from early phase MS studies of B cell depletion with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) further support a role for B cells in disease pathogenesis, and the rapid onset of action of this strategy (without obvious effects on IgG levels) suggests that antibody-independent functions of B cells likely contribute to the observed therapeutic effect.",

In MS, evidence supporting a pathogenic role for EBV comes from epidemiological, immunological and histopathological studies. The presence of abnormal deposits of EBV-infected B cells/plasma cells in post-mortem brain tissue from cases with acute, relapsing-remitting and progressive MS courses is compatible with abnormalities in humoral immunity, such as persistence of B-cell clones that expand and produce immunonoglobulins intrathecally and formation of intrameningeal B-cell follicles (as latent EBV infection promotes B-cell activation and growth), and with increased immune reactivity to EBV in the patients' blood and cerebrospinal fluid (as both the latent and lytic EBV proteins are potent immunogens and elicit strong B-and T-cell immune responses). EBV could promote chronic brain inflammation through mechanisms that involve autoimmunity (e.g., molecular mimicry or rescue of self-reactive B cells) and/or virus-induced immunopathology resulting from the inability of the immune system to control viral infection in the CNS properly. In this talk, I shall present findings that expand previous evidence of dysregulated EBV infection in the MS brain and discuss a scenario in which cytotoxic immune responses targeting intracerebral EBV deposits may play a major role in maintaining a chronic inflammatory condition in the MS brain. Accumulating data indicate that B lymphocytes and antibodies are involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that depletes circulating CD20+ B cells in humans. We report the results from an investigator-initiated trial of rituximab in relapsing MS patients.",

The high prevalence of autoimmune diseases in industrialized countries may, in part, be due to reduced early life exposure to common microbial agents and a more hygienic environment.

The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was first used to image living subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS) \u223c25 years ago. Despite limitations of early relatively low field scanners and crude imaging sequences it was immediately evident that MRI provided an important portal to the pathology of this disease; pathology that previously could only be adequately sampled once in a patient's lifetime. Early studies based completely on the constraints placed on the relaxation properties of water molecules imposed by the structural characteristics of their microenvironment provided an early look at well established MS lesions or plaques. The introduction of paramagnetic contrast agents and their use in longitudinal serial scanning of patients unveiled the very dynamic nature of lesion formation and evolution over time. MRI has secured an important place in the diagnosis of the disease, in monitoring the evolution of the disease process and in the investigation of the potential benefit of new treatments for the disorder. MRI also provides important information for the categorization of disease activity that may be crucial for understanding the results of investigations into the aberrant immune responses of MS patients; phenomena that appear to be fundamental to our current understanding and approaches to manage this potentially devastating disorder. At least in the early clinical phases of MS, MRI not only aids in securing the diagnosis of the disease, but also enables short-term prognosis as to the disease's course. While the specificity of MRI findings for the pathologic changes that are present in affected tissues places some limitations on the correlation between quantitative MRI findings and clinical disability that currently constrains the use of MRI is a true surrogate, they have not undermined the ability of serial MRI to measure the biological efficacy of new therapeutic agents. Central issues that are actively being addressed include whether composite measures of conventional MRI parameters can provide better concomitant and predictive correlations with clinical disease status in the short or long term, if better pulse acquisitions or higher field imaging can better delineate cortical pathology and its evolution, and do the more global changes in brain pathology as seen with advanced MRI approaches reflect distributed change in neuronal pathways that are the consequences of classic focal lesions or do they bespeak an independent neurodegenerative process. Subtle changes in T cell effector function are clinically critical, e.g. in autoimmune disease, allergy, and insufficient immune responses to cancer. As the foundation for the design of molecular therapeutics it is thus important to understand, how modest changes in receptor engagement on the T cell surface are processed under varying physiological circumstances in the complex T cell signaling network to regulate T cell effector function. The ability of signaling intermediates to interact with each other in such networks is encoded by extensively studied biochemical properties. In addition and much less well understood, the concentrations of signaling intermediates inside live cells vary in time and space. We refer to these variations as 'spatiotemporal patterns'. They are critical for how the efficiency of signaling is regulated in live cells, as enrichment of two proteins in the same location at the same time increases their interaction probability. Spatiotemporal patterning needs to be studied in a systems approach. The spatiotemporal patterning of an individual signaling intermediate only becomes of interest when it can be compared to the patterns of multiple other components of the same network. First, we have therefore determined the spatiotemporal patterns of 26 elements of T cell activation in the activation of primary T cells by antigen presenting cells. The most striking finding was that every signaling intermediate had a unique spatiotemporal pattern. Such diversity of spatiotemporal patterning is of critical significance. Since spatiotemporal patterning differed dramatically between signaling intermediates, the likelihood of signaling intermediates to interact with each other varies substantially in time and space during T cell activation; spatiotemporal patterning has to be a significant regulator of T cell activation. Second, we have provided causal support for this hypothesis. Addressing a particular signaling intermediate, the central regulator of cell polarity Cdc42, we have shown that subcellular localization not overall cellular activity is most critical for Cdc42 function. Together, these data establish that the regulation of spatiotemporal pattering in T cell activation is a critical element in the control of the efficiency of T cell activation. Molecular therapeutics targeting such regulation may be of great utility in modulating T cell activation in autoimmune disease, allergy, and insufficient immune responses to cancer.",

            "text": "In the past few years, the use of modern quantitative MR techniques has indeed reshaped the picture of MS leading to the formulation of the so called \"axonal hypothesis\" (i.e., changes in metabolism, morphology, or density of the axons are important determinants of functional impairment in MS). In this context, metrics derived from magnetization transfer and diffusion-weighted MRI enable us to quantify the extent of structural changes occurring within T2-visible lesions and normal-appearing tissues (including gray matter) with increased pathological specificity to irreversible tissue damage over conventional MRI. Proton MR spectroscopy adds valuable pieces of information on the biochemical nature of such changes. Finally, functional MRI is providing new insights into the role of cortical adaptive changes in limiting the clinical consequences of MS-related irreversible tissue damage. As a consequence of the extensive application of these MR techniques our current understanding of the pathophysiology of MS is that it is not only a disease of the white matter, characterized by focal inflammatory-demyelinating lesions, but is also associated to more subtle and diffuse damage throughout the white and gray matter of the entire CNS. The inflammatory and neurodegenerative components of the disease process are present from the earliest clinical phases of the disease, but appear to be, at least partially, dissociated. In addition, recovery and repair play an important role in the genesis of the clinical manifestations of the disease, involving both structural changes (e.g., clearance of inflammation and remyelination) and plastic reorganization of the cortex. This new picture of MS has important implications in the context of treatment options, since it suggests that agents that protect against neurodegeneration or promote tissue repair may have an important role to play alongside agents acting on the \"more classical\" inflammatory component of the disease. Anti-GQ1b ganglioside antibodies are found in the acute phase sera of more than 90% of the Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS) patients. These antibodies are believed to be the pathogenic factors leading to neuromuscular paralysis. We have previously shown in an in vitro mouse model using diaphragm muscle-nerve preparations that anti-GQ1b antibody binds presynaptically at the neuromuscular junction and activates the complement system, culminating in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC; C5b-C9). Functional and electrophysiological analyses showed block of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction, after an initial period of a dramatically high and asynchronous release of acetylcholine, and associated paralysis of the muscle. Morphology showed MAC deposition at the neuromuscular junction and neurofilament degradation. Since complement involvement with the formation of MAC is an important factor in membrane injury in general, it forms an attractive pharmacotherapeutic target.",

A high degree of galactosylation of IgG antibodies has been associated with clinical remissions in rheumatoid arthritis. Differences in glycosylation might also play a role in the autoimmune myasthenic syndromes. Autoantibodies are mainly IgG1 and IgG3 in AChR MG and LEMS, but IgG4 in MuSK MG. Both AChR MG and LEMS occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome or as an idiopathic autoimmune disease in association with the HLA B8-DR3 haplotype.

Most patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) have IgG1 antibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) or muscle specific kinase (MuSK). The remaining patients, termed seronegative myasthenia (SNMG) have been shown recently to have antibodies that bind to AChRs when they are densely clustered on the surface of transfected cells (as they are at the neuromuscular junction). MuSK antibodies are thought to be predominantly of the IgG4 subclass. Antibodies against aquaporin-4, a membrane water channel expressed in astrocytes and choroid plexus epithelial cells, are found in a high proportion of patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO), clinically characterised by optic neuritis and myelitis, and are also IgG1.

There has been some debate on the classification, and naming of the disorder; recent findings showed an underlying humoral abnormality in NMO, characterized by the presence of a highly specific serum antibody against aquaporin-4, the most abundant water channel in the CNS (called NMO-IgG or Aqp4-Ab). In this study, we aimed at evaluating the NMO-IgG/Aqp4-Ab status among Turkish patients with NMO, and to find out any clinical significance.",

Sex ratio (F:M) was 16:5 (3.2). Disease followed monophasic course in five patients and multiphasic course in 16. First clinical episode was optic neuritis in 14, transverse myelitis in two, and both in five cases. 17 of the sera were taken at an acute attack, four were taken at remission. NMO-IgG/Aqp4-Ab was positive in 12/21 (57%) patients. Among the NMO-IgG seropositive cases, nine had an EDSS of six or more, whereas only two patients in the seronegative group had such severe disability (p b 0.05), and the NMO-IgG positive cases had a mean EDSS score of 5.5 + 1.6 compared with 3.8 + 1.9 in NMO-IgG negative cases (p b 0.05).

However, the number of trials needed to achieve the task nearly doubled for the saline-injected APPSwe/PS1 transgenic mice. M-CSF also increased the number of microglia in the parenchyma (2.4 fold and 2.7 fold increase in cortex and hippocampus, respectively) and decreased the number of Abeta deposits. Senile plaques were smaller and less dense in the brain of M-CSF-treated mice compared to littermate controls treated with vehicle solution. Interestingly, a higher ratio of microglia internalized Abeta in the brain of M-CSF-treated animals and the phagocytosed peptides were located in the late endosomes and lysosomes as shown by colocalization with the LAMP-2 marker. Less Abeta40 and Abeta42 monomers were also detected in the extracellular protein enriched fractions of M-CSF-treated transgenic mice when compared to vehicle controls.",

Genetic factors are believed to be of importance for outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, so far mainly allelic variation in apolipoprotein E4 has been studied in human TBI. A strategy for the identification of genes regulating complex traits is to perform linkage analysis in large intercrosses of susceptible and resistant strains. Previously we have identified several gene regions that regulate different aspects of inflammation and neurodegeneration induced by spinal ventral root avulsion (VRA) in inbred DA and PVG rats. These quantitative traits (QTL) include Vra1, which regulate axotomyinduced nerve cell loss, and Vra4 that regulate expression of MHC class II on microglia.

This supports the notion that qualitative differences in class II mediated antigen presentation to be of pivotal importance in these conditions.

This is the first study that identified genetic factors determining the immunogenicity of a protein-based diseasemodifying agent. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an essential role in host defense responses. Following recognition of pathogen-associated molecules and self molecules TLR generally trigger pro-inflammatory factors and enhance antigen-presenting cell functions. In our previous studies, we demonstrated the presence of various TLRs in and on human astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes. Marked differences, however, separate TLRs on either type of glial cell. In microglia, a rather diverse set of TLRs are expressed and at least TLR3 and TLR4 can be found only inside endosomal vesicles. Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes on the other hand, express a more limited set of TLRs, and only on their cell surface. Upon activation of astrocytes a selective and strong induction of TLR3 was observed. Gene profiling and functional data indicated that TLR3 activation on astrocytes acts as a repair mediator.",

Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure gene expression by astrocytes and microglia isolated from naive mice and from mice that received ligands for TLR3 (Poly-I:C) and TLR4 (LPS) by intrathecal injection. As expected naive microglia expressed a wide range of TLR receptors and co-receptors (e.g. TLR's 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and CD14), and naive astrocytes predominantly expressed message for TLR3 and TLR6. At 18 h following injection of LPS or Poly-I:C, both astrocytes and microglia showed significant upregulation of TLR2 message.

Using mouse primary microglial cultures, we show that the CD38, via its calcium-mobilizing metabolite cyclic-ADP-ribose (cADPR), helps promote microglial activation and AICD induced by LPS plus IFNgamma (LPS/IFNg), suggesting that CD38 links the two processes. Accordingly, CD38 expression and activity, as well as intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the primary microglia were increased by LPS/IFNg treatment. Moreover, CD38 deficiency or treatment with cADPR antagonists conferred partial resistance to LPS/IFNg-induced AICD and also reduced [Ca2+]i. Microglial activation, indicated by induced expression of nitric-oxide-synthase-2 mRNA and production of NO, secretion and mRNA expression of TNF\u03b1 and IL-12 p40, and expression of IL-6 mRNA, was attenuated by CD38 deficiency or cADPR-antagonist treatment. The observed effects of CD38 on microglial activation is probably mediated via a cADPRdependent increase in [Ca2+]i, and the effect on AICD by regulation of NO production.",

In the adult mammalian brain, multipotent and self-renewing neural progenitor cells (NPCs) may generate new neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. NPCs may thus serve as a regenerative tool by which brain damage could be compensated. However, repair processes in response to inflammatory (and other) forms of brain injury are characterized by the failure of neuronal regeneration and the predominant occurrence of astrocytes (known as astrogliosis). Moreover, inflammation, which generates an oxidative milieu, has recently been reported to directly inhibit neurogenesis within the brain. We therefore intended to clarify possible molecular pathways underlying inflammation-mediated inhibition of neurogenesis and enhancement of astrogenesis in chronic autoimmune neuroinflammation.",

According to our data, Sirt1, a class III NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase involved in various cellular processes that comprise energy metabolism, transcriptional silencing, and DNA repair, mediates the observed redox effects, as mild oxidation in NPCs leads to increased Sirt1 deacetylase activity at the promoter of the proneuronal transcription factor Mash1.

One of the most essential functions of astrocytes is to regulate the level of extracellular glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. Astrocytes express glutamate transporters, most prominently excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), which performs the vast majority of synaptic glutamate clearance. This prevents excitotoxicity, the overactivation of glutamate receptors on the cell surface of neurons. However, during neuroinflammatory conditions, cytokines have been shown to inhibit astrocyte glutamate uptake. CD38 is a 45 kD ectoenzyme involved in the synthesis of potent calcium mobilizing agents, cyclic adenosine diphospho-ribose (cADPR), and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP+). Our previous studies demonstrated that astrocyte CD38 expression was upregulated upon immune or viral stimulation and, it played an important role in astrocyte inflammatory responses upon cytokine stimulation. We performed this study focusing on the effects of IL-1beta, a proinflammatory cytokine on the expression of EAAT2 in astrocytes and its results on astrocyte glutamate uptake ability.

The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) facilitates the recognition of conserved antigenic motifs of various pathogens, leading to the downstream production of inflammatory mediators. TLR2 is pivotal for glial recognition of S. aureus, a prevalent CNS pathogen, and eliciting proinflammatory mediator release. Recent studies from our laboratory have revealed a correlation between the loss of TLR2 signaling and aberrant Th17 infiltrates in the S. aureus brain abscess model, which may provide insights as to how TLR2 interfaces with adaptive immunity during CNS parenchymal infections. Since IL-17 exerts many proinflammatory activities, we propose that the exaggerated release of IL-17 in TLR2-deficient mice is a compensatory mechanism to mount an effective anti-bacterial immune response in the face of the loss of this important PRR. In other studies, signaling via the TLR/IL-1R adaptor MyD88 was essential for the induction of CNS innate immunity in the experimental brain abscess model. Specifically, the absence of MyD88 signaling significantly impaired the production of a wide range of proinflammatory molecules, attenuated neutrophil and macrophage influx into the CNS, and resulted in the exaggerated necrosis of infected tissue. Collectively, these studies reveal important roles for the TLR/IL-1R family of molecules in regulating both innate and adaptive immune responses during gram-positive infections in the CNS parenchyma.",

Serum antibodies from related disorders such as Pediatric Autoimmune Neurologic Disorder Associated with Streptococci with obsessive compulsive behaviors, vocal tics or tic-like movements demonstrated that the level of the CaM kinase II activity was increased at an intermediate level and the reactivity with lysoganglioside was not as evident although present in some patients. However, comparison of matched acute and convalescent PANDAS sera taken before and during the exacerbation demonstrated an elevation in CaM kinase II activity associated with disease. Study of an animal model of Sydenham chorea revealed that immunization with group A streptococcal antigen led to behavioral changes which correlated with antibody deposition in the striatum as well as reactivity of serum IgG with dopamine receptors and the induction of CaM kinase II activity. These data are consistent with the current hypothesis that disinhibition of basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical pathways may be involved in Sydenham chorea and with its treatment with haloperidol, a D2 receptor antagonist.",

The development of this syndrome coincides with a drop in viral load and recovery of T cell counts in the blood. Left untreated it may result in death over a few weeks. Neuropathological evaluation shows massive infiltration of T cells with a predominance of cytotoxic and CD8 cells. This is associated with glial cell activation and neuronal injury but relative sparing of myelin. To study the pathophysiology of this syndrome, we first determined the mechanism of activation of T cells by an HIV protein, Tat that is not impacted by antiretroviral drugs. Tat-mediated activation of T cells occurs independent of T cell receptors but is NF-kB dependent. Using human neuronal cultures, we found that supernatants from these activated T cells are neurotoxic. Granzyme B is a major neurotoxic substance released by the activated T cells. Granzyme B causes neuronal injury independent of perforin and the mechanism of neuronal injury by granzyme B sequentially involves the activation of a Gi-protein coupled receptor, notch-signaling pathways and over expression of potassium channel, Kv1.3 followed by neurite trimming and neuronal cell death by apoptosis. Pharmacological or molecular blockade of Kv1.3 results in protection against T cell mediated neuronal injury. Previous studies have suggested a role for Kv1.3 in activation of T cells. Thus, Kv1.3 represents a novel therapeutic target for this syndrome. Bone marrow stern cell in the rescue of brain diseases",

            "text": "Microglia are the immune cells of the central nervous system. They patrol the brain environment with their ramifications and they respond quickly in the presence of pathogens and brain damages. Bone marrow derived cells (BMDCs) have the ability to populate the CNS and differentiate into functional parenchymal microglia as well as perivascular microglia. Even though BMDCs can enter the brain parenchyma throughout the CNS in normal mice, it seems that they are preferentially attracted to regions afflicted by neurodegeneration or neurological insults. Of great interest is the fact that blood-derived microglial cells are associated with amyloid plaques and these cells are able to prevent the formation or eliminate the presence of amyloid deposits in mice that develop the major hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). These cells are also recruited in the brain of other mouse models of brain diseases and acute injuries. The exact mechanisms involved in these events have yet to be fully characterized. It is likely that stressed or damaged neurons send signal to resident microglia or produce specific chemokines to cause recruitment of BM-derived microglia. A number of proteins can act as endogenous ligands for tolllike receptors (TLRs) expressed on the surface of microglia and then trigger NF-kB signaling and gene transcription. This would necessarily lead to a subtle inflammatory response and consequently proliferation and chemoattraction of myeloid cells. Of interest is the fact that there is no need of a massive neurodegeneration and BBB breakdown. We can therefore propose that neurons, especially those in danger, have the ability to interact with microglia and stimulate their proliferation and recruitment, although the physiological relevance of this phenomenon is still largely unknown. We can speculate that this natural process takes place to provide survival signals and help to stressed, injured or infected neurons. A timely controlled innate immune response may also limit CNS toxicity by eliminating foreign materials and debris, thus contributing to create an environment that is more permissive for regeneration and recovery. Since toxic and secreted proteins are frequently the cause of many brain diseases, such a cellular therapy may prove to be quite effective to prevent and remove the main trigger of neurodegeneration. Hematopoietic stem cells represent therefore a fantastic new vehicle for delivering key molecules to improve recovery, repair and elimination of toxic proteins.",

Transforming growth factor-beta TGF-beta) has pleiotropic effects, both beneficial and harmful in the central nervous system (CNS). Transgenic mice overproducing this cytokine from astrocytes have higher numbers of T cell in their brains without showing overt signs of inflammation. However, when immunized against an endogenous or ectopically expressed CNS antigen, T cell infiltration and inflammation are aggravated. Consistent with these observations, TGF-beta1 synthesis in glial cells and TGF-beta signaling in the CNS were activated several days before the onset of paralysis in mice with autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Sequentially, after glial cells were modulated, TGF-\u03b21 signals then were induced in infiltrating T cells in inflammatory lesions. Pharmacological inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling ameliorated the paralytic disease, reducing the accumulation of pathogenic T cells and expression of IL-6 in the CNS. Priming of peripheral T cells was not altered, nor was the TH17 pathway, indicating that this effect was directed within the brain, yet affected the immune system. The early production of TGF-\u03b21 in the CNS creates a permissive and dangerous environment for the initiation of autoimmune inflammation. Inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling may have benefits in the treatment of the acute phase of autoimmune CNS inflammation. Late pregnancy is beneficial in MS. The third trimester has been associated with an approximate 80% reduction in relapse rate. Estriol, the estrogen unique to pregnancy, reaches highest levels in the third trimester. Estriol treatment was previously shown to ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) when used at a dose equivalent to what occurs naturally during late murine pregnancy. Numerous mechanisms are involved in estriol mediated protection from disease. These include both anti-inflammatory as well as neuroprotective mechanisms. Anti-inflammatory mechanisms have previously included the induction of favorable changes in cytokines, chemokines and T regulatory cells. Here we will present our recent observations of effects of estriol treatment on matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Neuroprotective effects include a sparing of axon densities and myelin white matter, as well as neuronal staining in gray matter. Estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and ER-beta differentially mediate these anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Together these observations in EAE provide a rationale for a clinical trial of treatment with estriol, at a pregnancy dose, in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). This trial will include both antiinflammatory as well as neuroprotective outcome measures. A distinct female predominance exists for a variety of human autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS). This differential gender susceptibility has also been observed in many experimental animal models of autoimmune disease, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The increased levels of sex hormones produced during pregnancy are reported to reduce the clinical symptoms of MS. Interestingly, the clinical symptoms of MS worsen post-partum, which is marked by reduced sex hormone levels. The work from our laboratory illustrates the large number of complex processes affected by estrogen that might contribute to the striking ability of 17-beta estradiol (E2) and its derivatives to inhibit clinical and histological signs of EAE in mice. These effects require sustained exposure to relatively low doses of exogenous hormone and offer better protection when initiated prior to induction of EAE, although oral ethinyl estradiol (EE) could partially reverse clinical EAE when given after the onset of disease. The main areas to be discussed include E2-mediated inhibition of encephalitogenic T cells, the role in E2 regulation of the newly described GPR30 membrane receptor (mER) and the E2 agonist G1, inhibition of inflammatory cell migration into central nervous system tissue, neuroprotective effects that promote axon and myelin survival, and finally new data showing synergistic treatment effects of E2 in combination with T cell receptor peptide therapy in MS patients. E2 effects on EAE were mediated through Esr1 (alpha receptor for E2) and GPR30, but not Esr2 (beta receptor for E2) and resulted in the dramatic down-regulation of IL-17 recently demonstrated to be the major pathogenic cytokine in EAE. Chimera studies demonstrated that E2 does not directly inhibit pathogenic T cells, but rather mediates its suppressive effects through other cell types, including macrophages and dendritic cells. Of mechanistic importance, immunosuppression that can prevent EAE also involves E2-dependent up-regulation of Foxp3 and PD-1 that contribute to the activity of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg). New findings indicate that G1, an E2 agonist that binds selectively to mER (GPR30), can mediate full protection against EAE by upregulating the PD-1 pathway in Treg cells as well as the antiinflammatory cytokine, IL-10. The protective effects of E2 and E2 agonists in EAE suggest their potential use as therapy for MS.",

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (iatrogenic chimerism) is often complicated by chronic graft-vs.-host disease which is a condition that resembles some autoimmune diseases and is strongly determined by the donor-recipient HLA-relationship. Considering these observations together led to the hypothesis that naturally acquired Mc from pregnancy and the childmother HLA relationship impacts risk of subsequent autoimmune disease.

To study immune tolerance to this autoantigen, we generated a transgenic mouse in which the AChR alpha chain was expressed in the normal physiological pattern (muscle N brain \u226b thymus) and used this model to assess the mechanisms regulating tolerance to AChR. Since AChR is expressed in the thymus, we expected that central tolerance would dominate, but several lines of evidence suggest that peripheral mechanisms may play a more significant role. First, T cell tolerance is maintained with age in spite of thymic involution; responses to the self determinant, but not to foreign antigens, were still seen in very old mice (28-30 months of age). Second, T cell tolerance remains functional in Aire knockout animals carrying the transgene. Third, when crossed to mice carrying a transgenic TCR specific for this ligand, tolerance was easily broken. Fourth, adoptive transfer of TCR transgenic T cells labeled with CFSE revealed a slight decrease in the number of cell divisions seen in an AChR\u03b1 transgenic host as opposed to a non-transgenic host. Fifth, using thymus transplant approaches, we demonstrated that T-cell tolerance to AChR\u03b1 is dependent on transgene expression in the muscle, but not in the thymus. Lastly, the tolerant state could be overcome by treating the mice with anti-CD25; this is consistent with a mechanism of tolerance that is regulated peripherally by regulatory T (T reg ) cells. To explore this further, a second transgenic founder line was generated in which the AChR\u03b1 transgene is expressed at a slightly higher level (2-3 fold) in both muscle and thymus. Preliminary thymus transplant and adoptive transfer experiments with this new founder line suggest that central tolerance may also be involved. Ongoing studies with the second transgenic line are designed to assess whether Aire and/or T reg cells play a role and if so, whether the level of expression and/or the distribution of the ligand among thymic epithelial subsets is critical.

AChR immune C3 deficient mice lymph node cells (LNC) produced less IL-6 and EAMG resistant IL-6 deficient mice had less serum C3. Moreover, increased serum C1q-circulating immune complex (CIC) levels correlated with EAMG disease severity in RIIIS/J mice. The CIC promotes EAMG severity by stimulating the production of IL-6, C1q and C3 via Fc gamma receptor interaction. However, MBL and C5a receptor deficient mice were equally susceptible to EAMG as wild-type mice, implicating that MBL pathway and C5a are not involved in EAMG development. Both complement accumulation and IL-6 up-regulation were also observed in the recently discovered CD4-independent EAMG in C57BL6 mice induced by LPS-AChR immunization. Anti-C1q antibody administration before and following AChR immunization suppressed EAMG by reducing LNC IL-6 production and neuromuscular junction deposits of IgG, C3 and C5b-C9 complexes. Treatment with anti-C1q antibody twice a week for four weeks in mice with ongoing clinical EAMG reduced the clinical severity of disease and LNC IL-6 production.

We have provided the evidence that active immunization with MuSK protein reproduces myasthenia gravis in rabbits. Next we focus on how MuSK antibodies cause MG. The pathogenic roles of MuSK antibodies in MG have been questioned as the number of AChRs is not reduced and complement is not deposited at the NMJ of biceps brachii muscles MuSK-positive patients with MG. The mechanisms of MG caused by AChR antibodies are well delineated, but the revealed mechanisms are not able to simply apply to MG with MuSK antibodies. MuSK antibodies have been identified as predominantly IgG4 subclass, which does not activate complement. We found that agrin-induced clustering of AChR was strongly blocked in the presence of MuSK antibodies, whereas absorption of the antibodies with purified MuSK products prevented this blocking effect. These results showed that the MuSK antibodies effectively inhibited the formation of agrininduced AChR clustering. Intriguingly, the monovalent Fab fragments of MuSK antibodies from rabbits with EAMG also inhibited AChR clustering by agrin on C2C12 cells, indicating that complement-mediated mechanisms are not necessarily required for such inhibition. We then examined the reduced expression of AChR at NMJ in soleus muscles of paretic and normal rabbits by fluorescence microscopy. In addition, the structure of NMJ in our paretic rabbits, as well as the size and branching of the motor terminals, were significantly reduced. Electron microscopic observations of NMJ in rabbits with EAMG induced by injection of MuSK protein demonstrated a significant loss of complexity of convoluted synaptic folds but no destruction, and EAMG model cited here resembles the phenotype of humans with MG and MuSK antibodies. Our results showed that MuSK antibodies inhibit both anterograde and retrograde signals required for maintaining the synaptic structures in mature NMJ. The EAMG model with MuSK antibodies will facilitate the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of MG with MuSK antibodies and functional roles of MuSK molecules in mature neuromuscular junctions.",

Additionally, fluorescent labelled beads can be used to quantify absolute numbers of these cell populations in the CNS. During Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), we could show that even before onset of disease, certain cell types already infiltrate in considerable amounts, amplify after onset of symptoms and peak at the maximum disease score. After relapse, the immune response is constricted, and the composition of immune cell types is altered substantially compared to before onset of disease. By using markers for specific cell subsets (naive/effector/ memory cells, regulatory cells) in combination with intracellular cytokine staining, we can follow the transition stages of CD4+ T cell differentiation in the inflammatory lesion. Finally, the presence of antigen-presenting cells (APC), like macrophage or dendritic cell subsets, and changes in their maturation can be monitored over the course of the disease. This protocol has also successfully been applied to the study of brain-infiltrating cells in a mouse model for stroke.",

Using a congenic line between these two rat strains, we confirmed a role of this locus not only in regulation of proinflammatory cytokines but also in regulation of MOG-EAE. Further fine-mapping of this region was performed in an advanced intercross line (AIL). Influence on EAE was dissected in G10 generation of AIL and influence on LPSinduced IL-6 and TNF production and pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) was dissected in G12. The initial EAE QTL was resolved into two loci. The first locus regulates clinical phenotypes in EAE and overlaps two QTLs regulating anti-MOG IgG2b and IL-6 production. This locus of 5 Mb harbors approximately 10 genes, including RGMa, a gene playing a role in spinal cord injury in mice.

Cumulative disease score, peak severity, days affected and severity index all increased with age of immunization in males but not in females. Incidence was not affected by age or sex but there was a seasonal effect. Since castration of young SJL/J mice restores relapsing remitting EAE susceptibility, we compared testes gene expression and hormone levels in young susceptible (B10.PL) and resistant (SJL/J) male mice. Serum progesterone levels remained constant in SJL/J males while levels in B10.PL males fluctuated over time. Specifically, serum progesterone was significantly lower in SJL/J mice from 4-8 wks and converged with B10.PL levels at 10 wks. This time frame correlates with previously published changes in susceptibility to EAE and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses. Microarray analysis of 4 wks old testes found 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, the enzyme that converts pregnelone to progesterone, was significantly lower in SJL/J mice compared to B10.PL suggesting that lower serum levels of progesterone are due to reduced progesterone synthesis in the testes. To verify that progesterone levels are related to EAE susceptibility, we planned to implant progesterone pellets and induce EAE. When placebo pellets were implanted and EAE induced, the previous sexual dimorphism was eliminated. Implantation of the sham pellet increased EAE severity to equal female EAE severity while non-implanted males had significantly less severe EAE suggesting stress of implantation abrogates the sexual dimorphism.",

An important neuropathological feature of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), but also other lesions within the brain, is the formation of an astroglial scar. Firm interaction of the astrocytes with extracellular matrix proteins is likely to be involved in astrogliosis. Indeed, an increased appearance of various extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin, at the lesion sites in MS has been described (Sobel and Mitchell, 1989; van Horssen et al., 2005) . This astrogliosis represents a major mechanical impediment to remyelination and axonal regeneration in MS. Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is a multifunctional enzyme, well known for its protein crosslinking activity. At the cellular level, TG2 has been implicated in adhesion and migration of fibroblasts and monocytic cells onto extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin (Akimov and Belkin, 2001; Balklava et al., 2002) . These data suggest a pivotal role of TG2 in cell-matrix interactions.

Microglia and infiltrating macrophages are considered major producers of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which plays a key role in ischemic tissue injury and brain inflammation. We report that TNF produced by microglia, but not macrophages, is neuroprotective in experimental stroke in mice. We found that cortical infarction was significantly exacerbated in TNF-knock out mice compared to wildtype mice. Bone marrow-chimeric TNF-knock out mice grafted with wildtype bone marrow cells developed larger infarcts than bone marrow chimeric wildtype mice grafted with TNF-knock out bone marrow cells, identifying a neuroprotective role for microglial-but not macrophage-derived TNF. Increased infarction in TNF-p55 receptor (R)-knock out mice compared to TNF-p75R-knock out and wildtype mice suggested that microglial-derived TNF exerted neuroprotective effects through TNF-p55R. The absence of TNF was associated with reduced microglial population size and expression of Toll-like receptor 2 in unmanipulated brain, and enhanced proinflammatory gene expression in unmanipulated and ischemic brain. Our findings identify a neuroprotective role for microglial-derived TNF in the acute phase after focal cerebral ischemia and suggest that microglia determine to what extent endangered cortical neurons survive after ischemic stroke. The pathogenesis of neurogenerative disorders, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 associated dementia (HAD), is exacerbated by an imbalance between metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). As the TIMPs have exhibited diverse non-classical effects including anti-apoptotic effects, the induction of TIMP-1 in neuroinflammation likely serves multiple functions in addition to modulating MMP activity.

This phenomenon is thought to be caused by inadequate levels of the anti-inflammatory hormone cortisol after stress. Cortisol is the end product of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis, also known as the stress-axis, and is routinely used in its synthetic form, prednisone, to treat relapses of MS. Post-mortem and in vivo studies clearly show that the stress-axis is chronically activated in MS. However, in a postmortem study of 16 MS brain donors, we recently found a highly significant inverse relationship between the responsivity of the stress-axis and severity of MS (Huitinga et al., Ann.

This has impact on the type and magnitude of immune responses following antigenic challenge, for example in vaccination. Little is known about the underlying mechanisms. One possibility could be the circadian and sleep-dependent modulation of immune responses by CD4+CD25+ natural regulatory T cells (nTreg). These cells have been shown in a variety of studies to negatively regulate adaptive immune responses. We could show that during normal sleep, the suppressive activity of nTreg was highest at night and almost no suppressive activity was present in the morning.

IL-27 favors na\u00efve CD4 T cells differentiation into Th1 cells to the detriment of Th17 or Th2 differentiation. In the absence of IL-27 receptor, mice had enhanced susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), due to the absence of IL-27 inhibitory signaling on Th17 development. Conversely, IL-27 has been demonstrated to promote CTL functions of mouse CD8 T cells, but no information on human cells exists. Moreover, no human CNS source has been identified. Our goals are to investigate the impact of IL-27 on human CD8 T cell functions and to determine the potential human CNS sources of IL-27. CD8 T cells from healthy donors were shortly stimulated in vitro and then analyzed using flow cytometry-based assays. Addition of IL-27 to anti-CD3 activated CD8 T cells led to a significant dosedependent increase of proliferation, and IFN-gamma and Granzyme B production. IL-27 had less impact on human CD4 T cells but significantly boosted their proliferation. Expression of both IL-27 subunits p28 and EBI3 was assessed by real-time PCR. Resting human adult microglia expressed very low/undetectable p28 and basal levels of EBI3 mRNA.

However, indications for the use of thymectomy in this population based on randomized trial data are lacking. Over the last 30 years, corticosteroids and other pharmacological immunotherapies have been used increasingly in MG, either alone or with thymectomy. Over this time period, outcomes for MG have improved dramatically. Whether thymectomy has contributed to this positive development remains a point of contention, and recent data will be reviewed.The MGTX study group received funding by NINDS for a 5-year single-blinded, two-arm trial. Approximately 70 centers are participating worldwide with the intention of enrolling 200 generalized MG subjects. The primary study aims to answer three questions: does extended transsternal thymectomy (ETTX) combined with a strictly defined prednisone protocol, when compared with the prednisone protocol alone (1) result in a greater improvement in myasthenic weakness, (2) result in a lower total dose of prednisone, thus decreasing the likelihood of concurrent and long-term toxic effects, (3) enhance the quality of life by reducing adverse events and symptoms associated with the therapies? Inclusion criteria are MG Foundation of America Classes 2 to 4, acetylcholine receptor antibody positivity, age at least 18.0 years and b65.0 years, and disease duration b5 years. Patients can be prednisone na\u00efve or not. Recruitment for the study commenced in late 2006. Diverse regulatory obstacles have been encountered due to the international nature of the trial. The average time for sites to satisfy local and U.S. federal regulations has been 14.5 months. As of July 2008, 61 centers were ready for enrollment and were screening all MG patients encountered. A total of 4575 MG patients have been screened, the vast majority ineligible. Fifty-one patients have been enrolled. The pace of recruitment has increased in 2008. An additional 17 sites are in various stages of regulatory approval. Entry criteria have been modified slightly to favor inclusionincreasing the upper age limit from 60 to b65 years and disease duration from 3 to b5 years. A result favoring thymectomy would establish its benefits unequivocally; failure to show a difference would suggest that thymectomy is an unnecessary procedure in this non-thymomatous population and should lead to cost savings. Thus the results will impact on clinical practice.

Since A2a and A2b-mediated signaling results in opposite effects than A3-mediated signaling, the predicted relative contribution of A2a and A2b over A3 to adenosine-mediated signaling would be enhanced by N50 fold in TLR-activated microglia. As a consequence, adenosinemediated inhibition of TLR-induced TNFa and IL-12p40p70 was much more potently inhibited in activated than in resting microglia. We could demonstrate that both the sensitivity to adenosine-mediated inhibition, as well as the overall inhibitory potential were enhanced in activated microglia. Microglia acquired this enhanced inhibitory phenotype b8 h upon TLR-mediated activation, and the enhanced inhibitory potential was sustained for N72 h. By using specific antagonists, we determined that the simultaneous increase in A2a, but not that of A2b, mediated signaling, and decrease in A3-mediated signaling were responsible for the described effects.

To gain insights into the potential mechanisms by which this T cell subset may induce nervous tissue injury, we study an animal model (herein referred to as L31 mice) that spontaneously develops a CD8+ T cell-mediated demyelinating disease associated with axonal damage primarily due to the transgenic expression of the B7.2 (CD86) T cell costimulatory ligand on microglia. We previously reported that the CD8+ T cells that accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS) of L31 mice are potent IFN-gamma producers and that responsiveness to this cytokine is a prerequisite for disease development. Since IFN-gamma is a powerful inducer of MHC-I expression and a common mechanism by which CD8+ T cells mediate destruction of MHC I-expressing cells is through the perforin pathway, we hypothesized that IFN-gamma production by CNS CD8+ T cells promotes upregulation of MHC-I expression on neurons and/or oligodendrocytes, which could become targets of a MHC-I-restricted perforin-dependent CD8+ T cellmediated cytotoxic attack.",

During various inflammation-related processes, including cell adhesion and migration, TG2 has been suggested to play a major role. Therefore, we propose that TG2 can contribute to some of the pathological processes underlying MS.",

Subsequently, we studied whether TG2 contributes to clinical disease during cr-EAE. KCC009, a specific irreversible inhibitor of TG2 was injected i.p. daily in cr-EAE animals from first clinical signs onwards. All animals were sacrificed when the PBS-treated controls reached the relapse phase of cr-EAE. Our data showed that inhibition of TG2 activity reduced clinical symptoms during cr-EAE dramatically and has an effect on the neuropathological outcome of cr-EAE. There was no significant effect on the mRNA levels of different genes which are normally higher expressed during cr-EAE such as CD68, inflammatory mediators, and genes involved in adhesion and migration processes. Immunohistochemical analysis with OX6, a MHC class II marker detecting monocytes, activated macrophages and microglia showed that KCC009 treatment attenuated monocyte infiltration in the spinal cord of cr-EAE animals whereas microglia remained activated in KCC009 treated animals.",

Since rhesus monkey cells produce more hydrogen peroxide than marmoset cells this may lead to more and faster disruption of compact myelin explaining the acute disease and destructive lesions in rhesus monkey EAE. We will discuss the expression of sialic acids and MAG in the brains of rhesus and marmosets with EAE. Moreover, data on the damage to DNA and proteins caused by ROS will be discussed.

Nevertheless, we found, that IL-17 production is not only restricted to CD4+ T cells, but even a greater number of CD8+ T cells.

CD4+ T cells constitute up to 40% of this CD3+ population, and 10-20% of these expressed IL-17. Furthermore, gamma delta T cells were detected in the CNS. Whilst these constitute only around 2% of the total CD3+ population, we show that 70% of these produced IL-17, but not IFNgamma. These findings correlated with increased expression of IL-1beta, IL-23, IL-6, TGF-beta, IFN-gamma, IL-17A and TNF-alpha mRNA in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and spinal cord of mice on day 14. In contrast, IL-17 mRNA expression, as well as that of IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-23, was significantly increased in the spleens of mice on day 7 of EAE, but subsided at the peak of disease.

We have observed histological changes in the livers of individuals with MS including the recruitment of neutrophils. We were interested to discover whether our model of EAE also exhibits cellular and molecular changes that might contribute to systemic pathology. We have previously shown that neutrophil recruitment to the liver after brain injury is associated with hepatic chemokine production and the expression of classical Acute Phase Proteins (APPs).

Intracerebral microinjection of stimulatory DCs exacerbated the onset and clinical course of EAE accompanied with an early T cell infiltration and a decreased proportion of regulatory FoxP3expressing cells in the brain. In contrast, the intracerebral microinjection of DCs modified by tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) induced their tolerogenic functional state and delayed or prevented EAE onset.

Since TH17 cells also produce IL-17F, which evidently acts through the same receptor complex as IL-17A, it is feasible that it could compensate for the loss of IL17A in IL-17Anull mice.

DCs play a crucial role in regulating beneficial immune responses and in the development of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). GM-CSF preferentially induces the expansion of CD11b+ myeloid DCs (CD45hi CD11c+). This DC subset can be further differentiated into a F4/80-negative and a F4/80positive fraction. We previously found that, in contrast to F4/80-DCs, the F4/80+ DCs isolated from the EAE-diseased central nervous system (CNS) inhibited T cell proliferation and EAE occurrence.

In contrast, MHCII expression is affected only marginally in thymic epithelial cells and B cells. pI is thus critical for driving CIITA and MHCII expression in the APC (microglia, macrophages and DC) that are most likely to be implicated in the effector phase of EAE. We therefore studied the susceptibility of pI\u2212/\u2212 mice to EAE induced by active immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide 35-55, as well as by the adoptive transfer of MOGreactive encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells.

Taken together these results demonstrate that the block in EAE development in pI\u2212/\u2212 mice lies at the level of antigen presentation during the effector phase in the CNS. To determine whether the absence of MHCII expression by CNS resident microglia or blood-derived APC is responsible for the resistance of pI\u2212/\u2212 mice to EAE, we generated reciprocal bone marrow-chimeras between wild type and pI\u2212/\u2212 animals.

As such, dangerous self-peptide can differ from a less dangerous one only at flanking residues through prohibiting induction of potent Treg. We next checked the dominancy of PLP peptides in SJL/J mice by immunization with spinal cord homogenate. Surprisingly, PLP136-150 was more dominant than PLP139-151 among immuno-dominant epitope in SJL/J mice, and PLP136-150-primed LN cells could react effectively than PLP139-151-primed ones.

To assess the relevance of the neuroinflammatory response, behavioral, neurochemical, neuropathological, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood analyses were performed in male adult C57Bl/6 mice exposed to systemic administration of MPTP. The data collected were correlated with longitudinal [at both early (3-24 h) and late (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks) time points upon MPTP administration] wide gene expression analysis of mRNA species involved in inflammation, immunity, stemness, self-renewal, neural differentiation, migration, DA metabolism and signaling, using TaqMan\u00ae Low-Density-based Array (TLDA) in ventral mid brain (VM) and striata (Str). Here we describe that MPTP-induced DA neurodegeneration and self-repair is likely to be associated to a localized biphasic astroglial response, a spatiotemporal recovery of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) immunoreactivity (IR) paralleling the spatiotemporal return of synaptosmial DA uptake capacity. Temporal reconstitution of damaged DA cell bodies and axon terminals appeared also paralleled by a switch of nigrostriatal astroglial phenotype. Among a total of 93 mRNA species analysed, we have identified a major time-and region-dependent up-regulation of inflammatory chemokines, such as CCL3/MIP-1a, CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL11-I-TAC and key transcripts involved in DA neurodevelopment, especially the morphogen wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) 1. Activated astrocytes of the VM were identified as potential elements of the Wnt signalling pathway sustaining nigrostriatal self-repair. This work suggests a surprising self-repair ability of the nigrostriatal DA system following MPTP neurotoxicity. It further implicates the MPTP-reactive \"in situ\" inflammation as key event in the molecular cascade linking tissue injury to repair. A deeper understanding (and manipulation) of the neurodevelopmental cues undergoing recapitulation upon CNS tissue injury is likely to have important implications for the treatment neurodenegerative diseases including PD. Increasing evidence suggests that spinal microglia could be an important player in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. We reported previously that peripheral nerve injury induced an early and transient spinal microglial cell proliferation which is in close correlation with spinal microglial activation and the development of neuropathic pain. To further test our hypothesis on the role of new microglia to the genesis of neuropathic pain symptoms, in this study, we investigated the effects of TGF-\u03b11, a potent antiproliferation and anti-inflammatory cytokine on spinal microglia reaction following peripheral nerve injury and the impact on nerve injury induced-hypersensitivity. Rats having a partial ligation on the left sciatic nerve (Seltzer model) had a sharp decrease in paw withdrawal thresholds bilaterally in response to mechanical Von Frey Hair stimulation. Withdrawal latency to heat insults (Hargreaves) was significantly lower unilaterally on the injured side. Correspondingly, following nerve lesion, microgliosis was induced on the spinal cord. A significant increase on the number of BrdU+ cells and the intensity of iba-1 (marker for microglia) immunoreactivity (ir) was observed on the ipsilateral side dorsal horn, with a slight increase on the contralateral side as well. Intrathecal infusion of rat recombinant TGF-\u03b2 (2 \u03bcg and 5 \u03bcg) for 14 days, starting on the day of nerve ligation, inhibited spinal microgliosis on the ipsilateral side dorsal horn by a reduction of BrdU+ cells from 22.71 in saline treated rats to 7.6 (2 \u03bcg), 10.5(5 \u03bcg) in TGF-\u03b21 treated rats, and a reduction on the iba-1 ir intensity (83.21/saline vs. 61.23/2 \u03bcg TGF-\u03b2 and 49.81/ 5 \u03bcg TGF-\u03b2 ). Intrathecal treatment of TGF-\u03b21 reduced partially nerve injury induced mechanical allodynia at both injured and non-injured sides, and completely abolished thermal hyperalgesia at the ipsilateral side. Together, our results suggest that peripheral nerve injury triggered a spinal microglial cell proliferation and these newly generated spinal microglia are involved in the genesis of hypersensitive pain behaviour. Inhibition of spinal glial response with a central TGF-\u03b21 treatment, which is effective in limiting spinal microgliosis, could relieve partially mechanical allodynia, however completely prevented the development of thermal hyperalgesia. which deductively are cytotoxic T lymphocytes, show similarities concerning V-beta/J-beta usage, length of the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), and some biochemical characteristics of the CDR3 amino acids suggesting common driving antigen(s) without shared clones.

We wanted to define the specific contribution of infiltrating monocytes to spinal cord recovery.",

This ablation of monocyte-derived cells found in close proximity to the injured site, resulted in impaired recovery of motor function. Restoration of the monocyte pool restored the healing process. Immunization, which was previously shown to augment recovery from severe spinal cord injury, resulted in enhanced recruitment of these myeloid cells. Importantly, these cells exhibited characteristics of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and restricted the local immune response via, at least in part, the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10).",

Fingolimod is converted in vivo to its active phosphate by sphingosine kinase and then binds to S1P1,3,4 and 5 receptors (S1PRs) with high affinity. Binding of fingolimod to S1P1 on lymphocytes causes their sequestration within peripheral lymph nodes, thus reducing lymphocytic infiltration into the CNS, which is considered an important part of the mechanism of action of fingolimod. In addition, fingolimod readily crosses the blood brain barrier and CNS cells also express S1P receptors, suggesting further direct effects within the CNS. In the current experiments we determined if fingolimod can protect from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) after the onset of demyelination.",

Microglia were isolated from primary mixed glial cell cultures prepared from neonatal C57BL/6J mice. Peritoneal macrophages elicited with 2 ml of 4% thioglycolate injected intraperitoneally into C57BL/6J mice were collected. Neuronal cultures were prepared from the mice at embryonic day 17. Microglia and macrophages were cultured with 1 micro g/ml LPS for 24 h in the graded concentrations of CBX or DON. Glutamate concentration of the conditioned media was determined with the Glutamate Assay Kit colorimetric method. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were detected by RT-PCR. Neurotoxicity in the conditioned media of microglia and macrophages treated with CBX or DON was determined by dye exclusion method with propidium iodide. EAE in C57BL/6J mice were induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide. DON and CBX were injected intraperitoneally into the mice every other day from day-2. Microglia and macrophages stimulated with LPS produced glutamate. LPS-stimulated macrophage conditioned media induced robust neurotoxicity, which was completely inhibited by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801. Both the DON and CBX effectively suppressed glutamate production and subsequent neurotoxicity by activated microglia and macrophages. EAE severity was significantly reduced in 2.0 mg/kg CBX-treated mice, and EAE onset was delayed and EAE severity was significantly reduced in 1.6 mg/kg DON-treated mice compared with PBS-treated control.",

Although the pathogenic mechanisms involved in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis/multiple sclerosis (EAE/MS) are not well understood, accumulating data suggest that oxidative stress plays a major role in lesion development. Metallothioneins (MTs) are a family of low-molecular weight, cysteine-rich proteins that act in protection against oxidative stress. In the central nervous system (CNS), two neuroprotective antioxidant MT isoforms (MT-I and MT-II), and a brainspecific isoform (MT-III), acting as an inhibitor of neuronal growth, have been identified. The abundance of MT isoforms induced in CNS by tissue injury suggests a role for MTs in several neuropathologies. The present study was aimed at evaluating the expression profiles of the three brain MT isoforms during EAE progression and following murine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) treatment. In parallel, oxidative stress conditions were monitored by assessing the activity of the main antioxidant enzymes.",

While MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are thought to be mediated and regulated by CD4+ Tcells, several reports from us and others show that CD8+ T cells play an important role in MS/EAE immunology. Glatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone) is an immunomodulatory MS therapy that is believed to mediate its effects through Th1 to Th2 immune deviation. We have shown that GA therapy induces robust CD8+ T cell responses, which are suppressor and cytotoxic in nature and may mediate immune effects through HLA-E-mediated killing of activated CD4+ T cells. We further show that CD8+ T cells are, in fact, essential in mediating the effects of GA on EAE. We also address the role of CNS-specific CD8+ T cells in the disease process. While these cells are widely believed to be pathogenic in nature, we show that both in human MS and in EAE, CNS-targeted CD8+ T cells have an immune suppressor role. We also demonstrate that untreated MS patients are functionally deficient in not only CD4+, but also CD8+, regulatory T cells (T reg s). Interestingly, all human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells attain a transient FOXP3+ state following multiple modes of stimulation. Importantly, in this state they behave unequivocally like bonafide T reg s as assessed by in vitro suppressor assays. Thus, we believe that MS is a disease of perturbed immune regulation characterized by the inability to sustain induced T reg s. We are therefore evaluating the interplay between antigen presenting cells and T cells to dissect the ability of immune populations to modulate T cell development into suppressor vs. effector cells.",

The majority of the patients experience relapsing-remitting symptoms followed by a secondary progressive phase leading to permanent disability once chronic disease has set in. The current treatment of MS relies on immunologic manipulation. However, it is becoming clear that repair should be considered as a goal for treatment. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model of MS, and provides a powerful tool for investigating the pathogenesis of MS. Although current evidence shows that remyelination and regeneration occur spontaneously to some extent, it is not nearly sufficient enough in MS or EAE. Remyelinating oligodendrocytes arise from differentiation of neural progenitors and lack of progenitor function has been proposed to play a role in remyelination failure in MS. Understanding how inflammation can impact the function of neural stem cells (NSCs) acutely and chronically is critical for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting endogenous and exogenous NSCs.",

For example, T celldepleted mice exhibit impaired cognitive performance, which could be reversed following injection of exogenous T cells from genetically matched donors. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of T cells in the brain are not well understood. We now suggest that cognitive impairment is a result of a malfunctioning meningeal immune surveillance in T cell deficient mice. Myeloid cells, occupying subarachnoid and ventricular spaces, exhibit a skewed pro-inflammatory phenotype in the absence of T cells and produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by meningeal myeloid cells are proposed to diffuse into brain parenchyma and to affect astroglial activation. Immune deficient mice possess higher levels of activated astrocytes along with a reduced expression of the synaptogenic protein, thrombospondin1 (TSP1), as compared to wild type mice. Moreover, immune deficient mice have fewer hippocampal synapses when compared to wild type counterparts. We show that while anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-4, increases TSP1 expression in astrocytes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta and TNF-alpha inhibit its expression, which is, supposedly, responsible for reduced synapses and for cognitive impairment observed in immune deficient mice. Our results not only shed a light on a potential mechanism underlying cognitive dysfunctions associated with immune decline but might also lead to a development of new future therapies for cognitive and mental conditions that target meningeal. Neuroinflammation, marked by gliosis and infiltrating T-cells, is a prominent pathological feature in human ALS as well as in models of neurodegenerative diseases. Transgenic mice ubiquitously overexpressing mutant Cu 2+ /Zn 2+ superoxide dismutase (mSOD1), a chronic neurodegenerative model of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), exhibit such neuroinflammatory changes. We have documented that the innate immune system plays a pivotal role in determining the rate of disease progression in mSOD1 mice by demonstrating that microglia either lacking or with reduced mSOD1 expression enhance motoneuron protection and slow disease progression in such models. These studies were carried out in mice that are unable to develop myeloid cells, but in which both peripheral and central immune systems are modified.",

They are only apparently distinct process because as soon as the pathological process becomes chronic they have the tendency to become strictly interrelated. As such, primary neurodegeneration triggers a secondary inflammatory reaction while primary inflammatory reactions lead to neurodegenerative phenomena. Several molecular and cellular events sustaining intrinsic brain repair mechanismsoccurring within the CNS as a consequence of chronic inflammatory and/or degenerative processeshave been described so far. They can be divided into three distinctalthough strictly interrelatedcategories: inflammation-driven processes, CNS plasticity and neuro (glio)genesis. By one hand, humoral and cellular inflammatory components shift sense (function) over time from a tissue-damaging mode to a mode promoting tissue repair (e.g. neurotrophic support from inflammatory cells). By the other hand, the recruitment of alternative \"non-damaged\" functioning neuronal pathways (cortical maps)occurring mainly via axonal branching and synaptogenesis takes place as a consequence of brain damage. Whether or not (and to what extent) the recapitulation of precise developmental pathways underlies the whole phenomenon of brain plasticity is still matter of investigation. Finally, endogenous neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs)the self-renewing and multipotent cells of the CNS capable of driving neurogenesis and gliogenesis in adult lifemay adapt targeted migration into damaged areas and promote repair via several mechanisms of action (e.g. neuro and gliogenesis, immunomodulation, neuroprotection). It is still a matter of investigation whether (or not) equally robust brain repair/protection can occur following the recruitment within the CNS of trans-differentiating stem cells of a different embryonic origin (e.g. developmental plasticity vs. cell fusion). Multiple sclerosis (MS)the most common demyelinating disease of the CNS affecting young adultsis an autoimmune disease encompassing both inflammatory (myelin and axon destruction) and degenerative (axonal and neuronal loss) features. Spontaneous brain repair (remyelination) occurs early during MS evolution but fails over time. Recent evidence clearly indicate that there are immunological, developmental and cellular events aiming at restoring tissue integrity in MS patients that operate early during disease evolution but lose their efficacy over time. This supports the ensuing idea that MS progression can be viewed as a dysfunction of the intrinsic brain repair mechanisms rather than caused by an uncontrolled, and still undiscovered, pathogenic alien(s). Antibodies against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) are implicated in myasthenia gravis as well as in autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG). AAG presents as severe generalized sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic failure. This disorder is also known as acute pandysautonomia or idiopathic subacute autonomic neuropathy. The most disabling manifestations are orthostatic hypotension (OH) and gastrointestinal dysmotility. An autoimmune pathogenesis was suggested by the subacute onset, frequent association with antecedent viral illness, occasional association with cancer or other autoimmune disorders, and spontaneous recovery in some patients. Many cases have a rapid onset, but others have a chronic progressive course.",

In particular, they are present in about 60% of the acute-phase sera of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). Some of them may be directly involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms by biding to the regions where the respective target ganglioside is localized. We have recently found the presence of the IgG antibody that specifically recognizes a new conformational epitope formed by two gangliosides (ganglioside complex, GSC) in the acute-phase sera from some GBS patients. The IgG antibodies against GD1a/GD1b and/or GD1b/GT1b complexes are associated with severe GBS requiring artificial ventilation. In contrast, the binding activity of the antibody highly specific to GD1b is weaker towards GSC comprising GD1b than to GD1b alone because GD1b undergoes conformational change in that GSC. GD1b is localized in large sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia. Monospecific anti-GD1b IgG has been shown as a causative factor of sensory ataxic neuropathy. However, GBS patients with monospecific anti-GD1b IgG do not always have ataxia. We investigated whether the reactivities of anti-GD1b IgG to such GSCs are different between GBS with ataxia and that without ataxia. As a result, the reactivities to GD1b mixed with GD1a, GT1b, GQ1b and GalNAc-GD1a were significantly more reduced in ataxic patients than in non-ataxic patients (p b 0.001). It suggests that the IgG antibodies associated with ataxia are highly specific to GD1b. Thus, highly specific anti-GD1b IgG may bind to GD1b tightly to cause ataxia in GBS. Most of the patients with Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) have anti-GQ1b IgG antibody. Our recent investigation showed that some MFS patients have antibodies with higher titer against GSCs including GQ1b; such as GQ1b/GM1 and GQ1b/GD1a. Based on the results of anti-GSC antibody assay, there are three types of IgG antibodies in MFS; those specific to GQ1b itself, those specific to GQ1b/GM1 complex, and those specific to GQ1b/GD1a. Gangliosides along with other components as cholesterol are known to form lipid rafts, in which the carbohydrate portions of two different gangliosides may form a new conformational epitope. Within the rafts, gangliosides are considered to interact with important receptors or signal transducers. More study is needed to elucidate the mechanisms how the antibodies against gangliosides or ganglioside complexes cause nerve dysfunction. Increasing evidence suggests that CD8 + T cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). CD8 + T cells are found in greater number than CD4 + T cells in acute and chronic MS lesions, and preferential oligoclonal expansion of CD8 + T cells has been observed in the blood, CSF and brains of MS patients. Furthermore, therapeutic depletion of CD4 + T cells did not improve disease in MS patients, however, depleting all lymphocytes reduced new lesions and relapses. We have previously demonstrated in a murine model that CD8 + T cells specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) induce central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity upon adoptive transfer. To investigate the pathogenesis of MBP-specific CD8 + T cell-mediated autoimmune disease, we generated T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic models using two different MBP-specific CD8 + T cell clones. One model exhibits strong central tolerance while the other model exhibits a unique form of tolerance that allows MBP-specific CD8 + T cells to populate the periphery without inducing disease. Using the first model, we show that negative selection is mediated in the thymus by cross-presentation of MBP by non-bone marrow derived cells, and by synthesis and direct presentation of MBP by bone marrow-derived cells. Using the second model, we demonstrate that the unique state of tolerance, which is maintained during exposure to many immunogenic stimuli, can be broken by viral infection. Our data indicate that the ability of viral infection to trigger disease depends upon expression of endogenous TCR chains on the MBP-specific TCRtransgenic T cells. Expression of a particular endogenous TCR alpha chain confers specificity to a viral epitope, and T cell activation via the virusspecific TCR allows the T cells to respond to endogenous MBP using the transgenic TCR. Interestingly, viral infection of CD4 + MBP-specific TCR transgenic mice does not trigger autoimmune disease. These data provide a potential mechanism by which infectious agents may activate myelin-specific CD8 + T cells to trigger CNS autoimmunity.",

For example, inflammatory demyelinating lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) are repaired in many, but not all patients. Although strategies to promote myelin repair are eagerly sought, factors that govern remyelination in vivo have been elusive. Chemokine receptor CXCR2 facilitates inflammatory demyelination, by promoting myeloid leukocyte entry into the CNS. Blocking CXCR2 on these cells might suppress inflammatory tissue damage. During postnatal CNS organogenesis, however, CXCR2 positions oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the spinal cord, to receive timely growth-factor stimulation. CXCR2 is present in clinical and experimental demyelinating lesions, raising the question whether reengaging CXCR2's developmental properties might enhance remyelination.

Both cytokines are linked to stages in the development and maintenance of CNS inflammation, such as seen in MS or EAE. All known therapeutic agents, including the mAb ustekinumab or drugs interfering with transcription of the p40 subunit via inhibition of NFkappab, block simultaneously IL-12, p80, p40 and IL-23 via the p40 subunit. As yet, no drugs are available that can selectively interfere with either IL-12, p80 or IL-23.",

The translational effectiveness of immunotherapy for AD is likely to be dependent on how well animal models predict the type of immune response that will occur in humans. Notably, the evidence from the AN1792 clinical trial indicates that the overwhelming antibody response was to the free N-terminus of the amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptide (DAE). However, previous studies in mice identified an internal sequence, EFRH, near the N-terminus as the major B-cell epitope in A\u03b2. Importantly, anti-A\u03b2 antibodies generated in mice bind the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is expressed on the surface of cells, whereas the antibodies generated in the AN1792 clinical trial do not recognize APP.

Neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs) have the capacity to self-renew and generate functional differentiated cells (e.g., neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes). Due to their plasticity, NPCs could potentially be implemented in cell-based therapy to treat neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Besides the beneficial role provided by cell replacement, NPCs exert neuroprotection from inflammatory damage acting through multiple mechanisms alternative to cell replacement. Transplantation of NPCs in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), has been demonstrated to ameliorate the disease. NPCs injected intravenously or subcutaneously migrate in the central nervous system (CNS) but also accumulate, survive and persist in non-CNS sites. Undifferentiated NPCs are found within lymph nodes even after 100 days from transplantation. At these peripheral districts, NPCs seem to have immunomodulatory effects.

            "text": "Advances in understanding the molecular determinants of axonal growth within the adult CNS are likely to lead to therapeutic methods to promote neurological recovery after acquired injuries of the brain and spinal cord. Clinical trials of oncolytic viruses (OVs) for cancers have revealed that these agents are well tolerated. However, clear-cut evidence of efficacy has been elusive. A fundamental issue continues to limit the efficacy of cancer virotherapy: the response of the host to the ongoing viral infection. This response occurs at the level of intracellular tumor defenses to the viral infection, extracellular stromal reactions to the propagating virus, and, importantly, active host defenses consisting of innate immune as well as inflammatory angiogenic responses. The combination of these host responses severely limit and curtail tumor cell infection and viral replication, thus limiting anticancer efficacy. We thus believe that such host responses will have to be circumvented, even temporarily and/or partially, in order to fulfill the promising anticancer effects of these agents. Immune privilege and a paucity of dendritic cells (DC) in the brain contribute to immunological ignorance against glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive intracranial primary brain tumor. Herein we uncovered that activation of GBM antigenspecific T-cell dependent immune responses were mediated through the release of endogenous high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) from dying tumor cells in response to herpes simplex type 1 thymidine kinase (TK) gene therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Tumor-derived HMGB1 activated TLR2 signaling on GBM infiltrating, bone marrow derived DCs, which induced a systemic CD8+ T cell dependent anti-GBM immune response. DCs were recruited to the tumors following intratumoral expression of Fms-like Tyrosine Kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) and TK. Using chimeric mice we demonstrated that tumor infiltrating DCs were derived from the bone marrow. TLR2 signaling was required for the infiltration of DC into the tumor and for the subsequent activation of DCs for efficient antigen presentation. ELISPOT and antigen specific T-cell proliferation assays indicated that clonal expansion of tumor antigen specific T-lymphocytes was induced by treatment of glioma bearing mice with Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK (+GCV); crucially, this did not occur in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice. We then identified the endogenous TLR2 ligand responsible for TLR2 activation on tumor infiltrating DCs. HMGB1 was released from tumor cells in vitro, in response to Ad-TK (+GCV) and in the serum of GBM bearing Ad-TK treated mice in vivo. TLR2 signaling induced by media from Ad-TK (+GCV) treated tumor cells; could be blocked with either glycyrrhizin, which binds to both of the box domains on HMGB1 and prevents subsequent HMGB1 signaling, or with antibodies to HMGB1. These data indicate that HMGB1 is an endogenous, GBM derived TLR2 ligand. Administration of either glycyrrhizin or anti-HMGB1 immunoglobulins to tumor bearing, Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK treated mice, abolished GBM regression and long term survival, highlighting the critical role played by HMGB1-mediated TLR2 signaling to elicit T-cell dependent tumor regression. In summary, our data provide the first experimental evidence for the role of TLR2 signalling, and its endogenous ligand, i.e., HMGB1, in regulating immune surveillance against brain tumor antigens. The discovery of a central role for HMGB1 and TLR2 signalling in overcoming immune ignorance to brain tumor. Epilepsy has an incidence of about 1-3%, affecting an estimated 2.5 million Americans and more than 50 million individuals worldwide. Seizures can occur singly or temporally. Seizure disorders in some adults and children are often associated with infections such as viral infections. Many of these infectiontriggered seizure disorders are often refractory to many currently established anti-epileptic drugs. About 30% of patients with epilepsy are refractory to current anti-seizure medications. The goal is to define and characterize a novel virus infection-induced seizure model in C57BL/6 mice and determine the virus-host interactions that lead to seizure and epilepsy. C57BL/6 mice were infected with the DA virus (DAV) strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus or mock infected. Mice were followed for seizures, weight change, body temperature, motor function (righting reflex, rotorod) and neurologic changes including inflammation, perivascular cuffing and pyknotic/dying neurons. In addition, various knockout mice were infected to determine the role for IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma. C57BL/6 mice are susceptible to seizures induced by DAV infection. Approximately 50% of C57BL/6 mice develop acute behavior seizures 3-10 days p.i. Following a variable latent period, about half of the seized mice had spontaneous seizures, epilepsy. Motor function and coordination are impaired in seized mice. Pyramidal neuron pyknosis/death and inflammatory changes in the hippocampus correlated with seizure activity. IL-1R1 and MyD88 deficient mice developed seizures in similar numbers to wild-type infected mice but fewer numbers of infected IL-6 and TNF-R1 deficient mice developed seizures than wild-type infected mice. Interestingly more IFN-gammaR deficient mice developed seizures than wild-type infected mice. Cytokine mRNA levels were monitored by array analyses and real-time PCR. Innate immune responses to infection by DAV results in neuronal cell death and seizures. These seizures resolve and then following a latent period mice develop epilepsy. The characterization of this model will enable the investigation of viral and immune contributions in the central nervous system to the development of seizure disorders in humans.",

Adaptive immune responses clear adenovirally infected cells from the brain, or brain tumor cells, with high efficiency. In order to unravel the cell and molecular biology of T cell mediated clearance of virally infected cells from the brain, we have developed a novel approach to elucidate the communication pathways between T cells and infected brain cells, or brain tumor glioma cells. We previously demonstrated that T cell-mediated clearance of virally infected cells in the brain is IFN\u03b3 dependent, and does eventually lead to the death of infected brain cells. We have also shown that ISs mediate intercellular communication between T-cells and infected target antigen presenting cells in the brain. We have demonstrated the polarization of IFN\u03b3 in CD8 T cells which had established close synaptic contacts with virally infected astrocytes. To determine whether IFN\u03b3 only acts exclusively on target cells contacted by T cells, or whether it is secreted non-specifically into the extracellular space within the brain, we developed a novel method to detect vectorial IFN\u03b3 release at the level of ISs. Here we describe the construction of novel adenoviral bi-cistronic vectors encoding a constitutively expressed gene (e.g. eGFP; used as a marker to identify infected brain cells), and a second gene under the control of the IFN\u03b3 inducible GAS element (e.g. Cre recombinase, or luciferase). These vectors were tested both in vitro and in vivo for IFN\u03b3 inducible reporter gene expression. When injected into Rosa26 mice the antiviral T cells induced the expression of \u03b2-galactosidase, indicating that they established contacts with infected cells and released IFN\u03b3, which induced expression of Cre, and removal of the STOP codon within the Rosa26 locus that allowed expression of \u03b2-galactosidase; the release of IFN\u03b3 at immunological synapses is currently being examined. Our method allows us to utilize IFN\u03b3 regulated transgene expression as a means to elucidate the existence of targeted vectorial release of T cell cytokines, and to evaluate the function of immunological synapses in orchestrating the function of neuro-immunological circuits during antiviral and anti-tumoral immune responses in the brain in vivo.

We found that prevention of autoimmune diabetes by acute viral infection results from regulation of antiviral immunity. Following challenge during the prediabetic phase with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is increased while PD-1-expressing autoreactive CD8 + T cells decline and CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) are enhanced in terms of number, TGF-\u03b2 production and capacity to control T1D even when disease is virally induced. PD-L1 up-regulation delays overt diabetes and facilitates the action of virally enhanced Tregs in a synergistic phenomenon enabled by inflammation and Toll-like receptor 2. These results reconcile current discordance about the role of viruses in T1D and provide novel insight into disease etiology and potential treatment.",

            "text": "Innate immune evasion mechanisms of neurovirulent murine coronavirus Susan R. Weiss The neurovirulent murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), possesses mechanisms to ensure propagation and persistence despite the existence of host defense strategies. The type I IFN response is an important host defense in vivo as demonstrated by the increased susceptibility to MHV of IFN receptor knockout mice. We have shown that MHV induces IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis, albeit only at very late times post-infection, but does not induce IFN-\u03b2 protein synthesis in mouse L2 fibroblast cultures. The only cell type, prior to our studies, reported to produce type I IFN in response to MHV is plasmacytoid dendritic cells. However, we have observed that, while MHV does not induce IFN-\u03b2 in several types of primary cell cultures derived from the murine central nervous system, it does induce IFN-\u03b2 in macrophages/microglia in the brain as well as in cultures of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM). Furthermore MHV induction of IFN-\u03b2, at least in BMM, is dependent on MDA5. We and others have reported that MHV is highly resistant to the antiviral effects of IFNs in fibroblast cultures, but that coinfection with MHV, does not provide protection to the IFN-sensitive Sendai virus when IFN is administered prior to MHV-Sendai co-infection. However, pre-treatment of cells with MHV, can provide protection from the anti-viral effect of IFN-\u03b2 on Sendai, but not on other IFN sensitive viruses including NDV, Sindbis, and VSV. Using a reporter linked to an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), we found that MHV infection prevents activation of the ISRE by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and by Sendai infection. Interestingly, MHV does not prevent translocation of STAT1 to the nucleus following IFN-\u03b2 treatment, suggesting that MHV is able to actively block STAT1 at a later step such as binding to the ISRE. Similarly, MHV prevents type I interferon independent activation by Sendai of an ISRE driven reporter gene. However, it does not inhibit translocation of IRF-3 to the nucleus, suggesting that binding of IRF-3 to the ISRE may be inhibited by MHV infection. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we have shown that MHV-infection can downregulate a number of wellcharacterized ISGs important for recognition of viral dsRNA and antiviral defense. We are currently investigating the significance of these IFN-induced genes in the defense against MHV and the mechanism by which MHV downregulates their expression. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) belong to a family of nuclear hormone receptors involved in inflammation, lipid and glucose metabolism, cell proliferation and differentiation. Previous work from our laboratory has examined the efficacy of using a PPARg agonist after spinal cord injury (SCI) and noted modest behavioral and anatomical improvements. In this study, we examined the expression pattern after SCI of PPARd, the most prevalent PPAR isotype in the central nervous system where it is involved in brain lipid metabolism, differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) and myelination. It also appears to play a protective role in certain disease models like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Parkinson's and cerebral ischemia. In this study we used a rat spinal contusion model to investigate whether PPARd expression is changed after spinal cord injury (SCI). Contusive SCI was performed at the T8 level on Sprague-Dawley rats and spinal cord tissue was collected at 1-28 day post-injury (dpi); uninjured spinal cords served as controls. Cross-sections spanning the injury site were used to examine the number, distribution and phenotype of cells expressing PPARd. It was observed that after injury, PPARd+ cell numbers gradually increased throughout the first week. By 7 dpi, expression levels were significantly elevated and reached almost twice that of uninjured controls. Cell numbers remained elevated through at least 28 dpi. PPARd was localized primarily in neurons, NG2+ cells (putative oligodendrocyte progenitors), oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. This rise in expression could reflect an endogenous neuroprotective mechanism that may influence cell survival and promote myelination. Future studies will examine whether providing a PPARd agonist after SCI is beneficial and will test the role of endogenous PPARd signaling in CNS repair by performing SCI and demyelination injuries in PPARd knock-out mice.

            "text": "Alzheimer Research Laboratory, Case Western Reserve University, Department of Neurosciences, Cleveland, OH, United States Alzheimer's disease (AD) is typified by deposition of A\u03b2 peptides in the brain owing to an imbalance between production and clearance of A\u03b2 peptides. Apolipoprotein E isoforms are associated with age-related risk for Alzheimer's disease and play critical roles in A\u03b2 homeostasis in the brain although the basis of this remains a central unanswered question in AD pathogenesis. Liver X Receptors (LXRs) are ligandactivated transcription factors that regulate basal and inducible expression of the key cholesterol homeostatic genes ABCA1 and ApoE. Importantly, LXRs also act as potent inhibitors of inflammatory gene expression. We report that LXR signaling impacts the development of AD-related pathology. Oral treatment of one year old Tg2576 mice with the LXR agonist GW3965 resulted in a significant reduction in amyloid plaque burden and Abeta peptide levels in the brain that was accompanied by suppression of microglial-mediated inflammation. Genetic loss of either Lxr\u03b1 or Lxr\u03b2 in APP/PS1 transgenic mice results in increased amyloid plaque load and a significantly enhanced inflammatory response. These findings demonstrate that LXRs play critical roles in Abeta clearance and deposition from the brain. Importantly, LXR agonist treatment of Tg2576 mice dramatically attenuated behavioral deficits in these mice. LXR activation enhanced the clearance of A\u03b2 by facilitating the proteolytic degradation of soluble Abeta by neprilysin and IDE through an ABCA1 and ApoE-dependent mechanism. The capacity of ApoE to promote Abeta degradation is dependent upon the ApoE isoform and its lipidation status. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism through which ApoE facilitates the clearance of Abeta peptides from the brain and suggest that LXR agonists may represent a novel therapy for AD through this mechanism. The enhanced expression of lipidated forms of ApoE, through the activation of liver X receptors, stimulates Abeta degradation. Indeed, aged Tg2576 mice treated with the LXR agonist GW3965 exhibited a dramatic reduction in brain A\u03b2 peptide levels and plaque load. LXR agonist treatment also reversed contextual memory deficits observed in these mice. We report that ApoE plays a previously unappreciated role in facilitating the proteolytic clearance of soluble Abeta from the brain. Abnormal or excessive inflammation is thought to contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Although this topic has been widely studied in both basic and clinical enterprises, the mechanisms of brain inflammation and indeed the relationship between neurodegeneration and inflammation are poorly understood. Microglia are the principal brain-resident immunocompetent cells, and are relatively potent sources of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. Thus, experiments were designed to better understand the intricate relationship between intracellular oxidative pathways in microglia and intercellular inflammatory signaling. To this end, the production and/or disposition of oxygen free radicals in microglia were manipulated to determine the resultant effects on oxidative and inflammatory indices. Data show that the production of intracellular oxidants in microglia and macrophages is generally crucial to the subsequent production and release of cytokines and the adoption of a neurotoxic phenotype. However, the development of significant oxidative stress in microglia can also be associated with decreases in the release of inflammatory mediators, and the ability of free radicals to control inflammatory signaling in microglia/macrophages may be based on oxidative alterations to the multicatalytic proteasome. Together, these findings suggest that free radical production in brainresident monocytic cells could be a key mechanism regulating brain inflammation in response to various stimuli, and that interventions aimed at free radical regulation in microglia may provide novel and effective therapeutic avenues to ameliorate neurotoxic brain inflammation. Supported by RO1 NS046267, P20 RR15592, and P01 DA19398. The biological significance of post-traumatic spinal cord inflammation is controversial. Resident microglia and infiltrating leukocytes (e.g., monocytes/T-cells) cause neuronal cell death, axonal injury and demyelination. However, these same cells can promote neuron survival, axon regeneration, remyelination and revascularization. Over the past few years, we have used numerous strategies to manipulate resident and recruited immune cells in an effort to understand their reparative and injurious function in the context of rodent models of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Data will be presented that illustrate the conflicting effects of activated CNS macrophages with an emphasis on newer data that suggest a role for a subset of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in regulating various aspects of CNS repair (e.g., axonal regeneration, remyelination, gliosis) and/or down-regulating destructive neuroinflammation. Myelin-reactive and non-CNS reactive lymphocytes are also recruited to the injured spinal cord where they have been reported to have beneficial and detrimental effects. Data will be presented illustrating the pathogenic potential of B lymphocytes and self-reactive antibodies in models of SCI.

Cytokines from these activated glial cells may be involved in the pathophysiology of neuronal degeneration and regeneration. In this study, we have examined the neurotoxicity by microglia-derived factors. The most neurotoxic factor from activated microglia was glutamate. All the recombinant cytokines examined was not toxic to neurons. However, TNF-a exerted neurotoxicity via inducing glutamate in microglia and IFN-g induced minor neurotoxicity that was mediated through IFN-g-R and AMPA receptor complex. Upon stimulation with TNF-a, microglia produced glutamate by glutaminase using extracellular glutamine, and released it through gap-junction, but not through glutamate transporters. Both glutaminase and gap-junction inhibitors suppressed glutamate release and neurotoxicity by microglia. We then examined whether glutaminase inhibitor (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine: DON) and gapjunction inhibitor (Carbenoxolone: CBX) suppress neuronal damage in vivo, using animal models. Both DON and CBX significantly suppressed delayed neuronal cell death in hippocampus after brain ischemia, and also increased survival of the animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Blockade of the unique mechanisms in glutamate production and release by microglia may be useful therapeutic strategy against neuronal degeneration.",

Several studies have been conducted to investigate the pathological actors involved in T-cell activation/proliferation, such as chemokines, cytokines, integrins with the aim to identify a new anti-inflammatory therapy for MS. Osteopontin (OPN) is a proinflammatory cytokine that has been shown to bind to CD44 receptor family as well as a series of alpha-vbeta integrin receptors. These receptors are present on cells relevant to MS, such as leukocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. Literature evidence indicates that knocking out OPN in mice improved clinical outputs in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and that OPN treatment in EAE OPN knock out mice exacerbated clinical score and CNS inflammation (Hur E.

In 2005 B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia (B CLL, Binet B, Rai II, un-mutated IgVH, ZAP negative) was diagnosed, neurological disability measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was 6.0 at that time. Patient was haematologically treated with cladribine (continuous infusion for 7 consecutive days with the dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day, 2 cycles), there was no remission of B CLL, but EDSS improved to 5.0. HO treatment continued with alemtuzumab (30 mg subcutaneously three-times weekly, 12 weeks) with complete B CLL remission and further EDSS improvement to 4.5. Since 2006 there is an excellent clinical MS stabilization, last EDSS (Apr 2008) was 4.5. There was no increase of lesion load, gadolinium enhancement or atrophy progression based on magnetic resonance imaging (scans performed before B CLL treatment and in April 2008). Conclusion: New promising MS drugscladribine and alemtuzumabare currently a part of RRMS clinical trials, but probably could be individually beneficial in SPMS phase as well. Supported by MZ CR c.

            "text": "Microglia are innate immune cells in the brain engaged in antiviral responses. Of the 11 Toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR3 and TLR4 are unique in that they can transmit signals through a MyD88-independent, TRIF-dependent pathway resulting in the activation of IRF3 and IFN-beta gene expression. This latter aspect critically contributes to antiviral immunity.In order to gain insight into the specific TLR signaling pathways that regulate gene expression and antiviral activity, human fetal microglia were challenged with specific TLR ligands (poly IC or LPS) and their responses compared using four different approaches: (1) microarray analysis; (2) analysis of antiviral activity against HIV; (3) immunoblot analysis of cell signaling pathways (NF-kappaB, IRF3, MAPK, PI3K, GSK-beta, etc); and (4) dominantnegative expression of IRF3. The emerging picture shows that the cell signaling and gene expression profiles triggered by poly IC and LPS in microglia are remarkably similar. Surprisingly, we find that LPS (similar to poly IC) potently inhibits HIV infection/replication in microglia.These results demonstrate that IRF3-mediated type I IFN expression and subsequent induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) is a major molecular pathway leading to innate antiviral immunity in microglia. We hypothesize that the undesirable aspect of TLR signaling leading to chronic inflammation and CNS damage results from proinflammatory gene activation that is mediated by NF-kappaB but not IRF3.

            "text": "Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an immune-mediated peripheral nervous system disease characterized by symmetrical sensory and/or motor symptoms. Even if its aetiology remains unknown, T-cell activation and macrophage-associated demyelination suggest a critical involvement of immune response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of T-bet, pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 in CD4+, CD8+T cells and monocytes from peripheral blood of CIDP patients and controls. Moreover we evaluated the production of IFNg, IL17 and IL10 by Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) from CIDP patients in different phases of disease. Finally we evaluated the expression of transcription factors in T cell and macrophage infiltrates on sural nerve biopsies.Sixteen patients with relapsing-remitting CIDP (11 in acute and 5 in remission phase) defined by Joint Task Force (EFNS-PNS 2005) criteria were included in our study. No patients had received immunosuppressive drugs, IVIg, plasma-exchange and corticosteroid treatment during 6 months before the inclusion in the study. The transcription factor expression (pSTAT1, pSTAT3 and T-bet) was analysed by intracellular flow cytometry. PBMC were cultured for 24 h and the supernatants were collected to measure cytokines (IL17, IFNg and IL10) by ELISA. Transcription factor expression in lymphocyte and macrophage infiltrates on sural biopsies was performed by intracellular immunohistochemistry. We found an up-regulation of pSTAT1, pSTAT3 and T-bet expression in monocytes from peripheral blood of CIDP patients in acute phase of disease than in ones from CIDP patients in remission phase and controls. Therefore we observed higher pSTAT3 expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from relapsing CIDP patients than in the ones from remitting CIDP patients and controls. We found a higher spontaneous production of IFNg, IL17 and IL10 by PBMC from relapsing CIDP patients than controls. IL17 production was significantly higher in relapsing than remitting CIDP patients, and IFNg levels from remitting CIDP patients were higher than ones from controls. By immunohistochemistry on sural nerve biopsy we observed a T-bet up-regulation in endoneural macrophages.Our data show for the first time that there is an up-regulation of type 1 and type 17 immune pathways in peripheral blood subpopulations and in lymphomonocyte infiltrate of relapsing CIDP. It is increasingly clear that the loss of neurons is important in the pathogenesis of permanent disability in multiple sclerosis. While some of this death may result from damage to demyelinated axons, the possibility remains that inflammatory mediators could also contribute to neuronal and axonal dysfunction and eventually cell death. The hypothesis of this study was that neuronal gene expression would be differentially regulated in vitro by cytokine mixtures typical of Th1 and Th2 T-cells and monocyte/macrophages (M/M).Neurons were obtained from brains of neonatal rats and incubated with the different cytokine mixtures or additional medium (controls) for 6 h. Neurons represented 88-90% of the cells, 10-12% were astrocytes. There were no oligodendrocytes or microglia noted. There was no evidence of cytotoxicity compared to control cultures as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. RNA was extracted and analyzed using Affymetrix REA 230 2.0 microarrays. We compared gene expression induced by cytokine mixtures to control cultures as well as comparing gene expression induced by the cytokine mixtures with one another. The cutoffs for this screening analysis was p b 0.05 with a 1.2 fold increase or decrease. In comparison to control cultures Th1 cytokines induced changes in gene expression in 1339 genes, M/M induced changes in 1190 genes and Th2 in 363 genes. Th1 and M/M induced changes in 444 genes in common, Th2 vs. M/M in 45 genes and Th1 vs. Th2 in 4 genes in common. There were changes in 816 genes unique to Th1, 682 unique to M/M and 238 unique to Th2. 40 genes were changed by all three cytokine mixtures. In preliminary comparison of these results with neuronal cultures to our results with the same cytokine mixtures incubated with CNS mixed glial cell cultures we note both similarities of genes regulated by these cytokines but also differences (other cytokines, chemokines and their receptors, Toll Like Receptor 2, Notch, GABA A receptors).Additional analysis and confirmation of changes in expression in genes of interest are underway and could lead to increased understanding of the effect of cytokines on CNS neurons in inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis and other diseases in which inflammation may play an important role. Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) is a rare neurological disorder of childhood characterized by uni-hemispheric inflammation, progressive neurological deficits and intractable focal epilepsy. The etiology and pathogenesis of this severely disabling inflammatory disease is still unknown. An intriguing feature of RE is the restriction of the inflammatory process to one brain hemisphere, setting it apart from any other inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Destruction of neurons by cytotoxic CD8 T cells has been proposed as a pathogenic mechanism underlying this enigmatic disorder.We challenged this hypothesis by analyzing the clonal composition and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of CD4 and CD8 T cells using polymerase chain reaction based spectratyping clonality analysis (immunoscope) from peripheral blood and corresponding central nervous system (CNS) specimens.Severe perturbations of the TCR repertoire were found in brain infiltrates from all specimens (n = 5). Clonal expansions, as evidenced by peripheral blood analysis (n = 14), belonged to the CD8+ T cells subset, while CD4+ cells showed normal distributions. Analysis of corresponding CNS/blood specimens revealed overlapping but also CNS-restricted expansions of certain TCR clonotypes. Longitudinal analysis of peripheral blood samples demonstrated dominance but also longitudinal persistence (up to at least 15 months) of specific CD8 T cell clones over time.Our data suggests the expansion of pathogenic T cells within the CNS as driving force in the disease progression of RE. These T cells, Axonal damage is considered the major cause of irreversible disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). Which mechanisms underlie axonal damage, however, and whether they are secondary to myelin damage remains to be clarified.Recently, we demonstrated that autoimmunity to the cytoskeletal protein neurofilament light (NF-L) induces axonal damage and neurological disease in mice. To characterize the neuropathology and compare it with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Biozzi mice were immunized with NF-L or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The distribution, pathological features and characterisation of the inflammatory infiltrates of spinal cord lesions were compared.Here we show that in NF-L-disease the lesions are predominantly located in the dorsal column displaying extensive axonal degeneration, but are also abundant in the grey matter. In contrast, lesions in MOG-EAE were restricted to the lateral and ventral columns and displayed less axonal damage and little grey matter involvement. In both cases myelin damage occurred but the numerous empty myelin sheaths in NF-L-disease suggest that myelin damage was a secondary event. Immunocytochemistry showed significant differences in the cellular infiltrates observed in the two models.In summary, autoimmunity to NF-L induces a distinct lesion topology, axonal damage and grey matter lesions supporting the notion that axonal loss and grey matter pathology may be the direct consequence of a primary autoimmune attack against axonal antigens such as NF-L. Continuous delivery of ganciclovir (GCV) at the site of a sciatic nerve lesion decreased the number granulocytes and macrophages by 98% and 89%, respectively, in the sciatic nerve distal stump of CD11b-TKMT-30 mice, but had limited effects on T-and B-cell recruitment. Axonal regeneration and recovery of locomotor functions from a sciatic nerve lesion were severely compromised in these mice, with large deficits persisting even at 49 days postlesion. Further studies revealed that this effect was due to an unsuitable growth environment in the nerve distal stump and not to alteration in the intrinsic capacity of neurons to regenerate, because: (1) neuronal cell bodies reacted normally to injury by overexpressing regeneration-associated genes, (2) clearance of inhibitory myelin debris was prevented, (3) neurotrophin synthesis, which we found to be specifically expressed by granulocytes and/or monocytes/macrophages in the sciatic nerve distal stump, was abolished, and (4) angiogenesis was compromised. Finally, we found that spinal cord injured axons that can grow into peripheral nerve grafts, sometimes in close association to blood vessels, failed to regenerate in the absence of CD11b+ cells.",

Chronic dysimmune polyneuropathy (CDP) encompasses several subtypes of neuropathies (np) with abnormalities in immune system activation and response. Peculiar electrophysiological, clinical and histological parameters are associated to anti-myelin-associatedglycoprotein (MAG) np, but immunological changes related to the presence of antiMAG antibodies are as yet unsolved. We investigated whether Type 1 and Type 2 cytokines patterns could be correlated with different CDP and particularly with antiMAG-np.Sixty-nine patients (30-90 years) with possible CDP were enrolled: 36 patients with chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-neuropathy (CIDP), 19 with chronic-idiopathic-neuropathy (CIN), and 14 with IgM antiMAG np entered the study. The control group included 89 healthy subjects (HC) and 18 with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) without np. The percentage of IL1b, IL2, IFNg, IL10 and TNFa-producing-CD4+ and CD8+ and IL1 b, IL10, IL6 and TNFa producing CD14+ cells were analyzed by flowcytometry. Mean cytokine values were compared in the five diagnostic categories by ANOVA. The direction of the statistical significance was tested by the Scheffe post-hoc test. Significant differences across diagnostic categories were found for IL1b, IL2, TNFa and IL10producing CD4+ cells (p b 0.0001), for IL1b, IL6, IFNg, TNFa, IL10producing CD8+ cells (p b 0.0001), and for TNFa, IL6-producing CD14+ cells (p b 0.0001). TH1/TH2 cytokines ratio was higher for all 3 groups of cells, when comparing CIDP and anti-MAG np. IL6 CD4 +, CD8+ and CD14+ values were highest in CIN compared with the other groups. Highest IL10 CD4+, CD8+ and CD14 +cells were reported for anti-MAG, differently from the other groups and specifically not present for MGUS.Different patterns and perhaps different roles of cytokines in nerve injury can be associated to different CDP. Interestingly, the highest IL10 level, reported for anti-MAG np, could be postulated as an antiinflammatory mechanism peculiarly associated to this np. These immunological findings are consistent with morpho-immunological reports showing that anti-MAG neuropathy has little or no inflammatory findings in sural nerve biopsies.",

            "text": "Chairs: S. Ziegler, R. Caspi Preliminary in vitro experiments show that human NPCs are able to inhibit T cell proliferation in response to mitogens and polyclonal stimuli (phytohemagglutinin and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimuli, respectively). NPCs reduce T cell activation in a dose-dependent manner both in presence or absence of cell-cell contacts, as observed in transwell experiments. Other preliminary results indicate that, when cocultured with human NPCs, monocyte-derived DCs display impaired differentiation and maturation. In addition to these initial evidences, possible effects exerted by NPCs on other cell types, such as B cells, will be investigated, ultimately trying to identify a mechanism at the basis of this immunomodulation. Studying the earliest phases of the development of demyelinating lesions can be difficult given the current animals models available. We have modified the currently existing Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) model of multiple sclerosis to permit the study of the lesion site hours to days after insult. In this model, TMEV is directly injected into the spinal cord of mice, thereby allowing for precise localization and aging of the lesion site.Following surgical exposure of the spinal cord, female SJL/J mice were injected with 2 \u00d7 104 pfus of TMEV (Daniel's strain) directly into the spinal cord white matter. Using antibodies directed against myelin proteins, immunohistochemistry revealed large areas of demyelination within three days of virus injection. Staining with a polyclonal antisera to TMEV revealed that the area of demyelination overlapped regions positive for TMEV antigens. Animals injected with cell culture medium (virus vehicle) did not show demyelination. Infectious virus was assayed in tissue isolated from the injection site, which revealed the presence of replicating virus at levels nearly 3 logs greater than the initial inoculum. Immune cells were recruited to the site of the demyelination within 5 days post-injection: CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were all found at the lesion site, as well as F4/80 reactive macrophages. Real-time RT mediated PCR was used to assay levels of various myelin gene transcripts from lesion sites dissected from the spinal cords as a function of time post-injection. Alterations in gene transcript levels were unique for myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG).Together, these data characterize a new model with which to study TMEV-induced demyelination at the earliest phases of lesion development. This should now permit definition of events that occur in the hours and days after insult, in particular with regards to the exact sequence of mediators and events that are triggered as a function of the infectious insult. Studies are ongoing to determine the earliest immune system participants in the demyelination process in this model.",

The clinical features were consistent with sIBM. Anti-HTLV-I antibodies were present in the serum of all the patients. The muscle biopsies showed endomysial T cell infiltration with rimmed vacuoles, deposits of phosphorylated tau, abnormal filaments in the nuclei and cytoplasm of the muscle fibers, all diagnostic of IBM. The muscle fibers expressed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I antigens and were invaded by CD8+ cells and CD4+ cells. In a single patient with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2, in situ HLA-A\u204e0201/Tax11-19-pentamer staining showed the pentamer-positive cells surrounding the muscle fibers. Double staining of immuno-gold silver staining (IGSS) and polymerase chain reaction in situ hybridization (PCR-ISH) revealed that HTLV-I proviral DNA was localized on helper-inducer T cells, but not on muscle fibers. HTLV-I proviral loads in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) from each patient were comparable to those seen in HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM)/tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP).This study suggests that HTLV-I infection may be one of the causes of sIBM, as has been reported in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a rare disease affecting young children as well as adults due to infection with herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). HSV-1 is a nearly ubiquitous virus commonly infecting humans however most do not develop HSE, suggesting that children with HSE possess an underlying genetic susceptibility to HSV-1. These patients are otherwise healthy and able to mount a normal adaptive immune response to HSV-1, pointing to the likelihood that they harbor an unidentified form of primary immunodeficiency disease affecting their innate immune response to HSV-1 infection. We have recently identified the first two genetic etiologies of HSE, autosomal recessive UNC93B deficiency and autosomal dominant TLR3 deficiency, validating our hypothesis. The goal of this study was to use a candidate gene approach to identify other gene(s) involved in HSE by cellular and immunological phenotyping.",

            "text": "The cellular and immunological phenotype is focused on one of the major components of antiviral innate immunity, namely, the production of and response to type I interferons (IFNs). Patients with mutations in UNC93B and TLR3 show reduced production of type I IFNs after viral and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stimulation, revealing a specific UNC93B-TLR3-IFN pathway as relevant to HSE immunity. We have identified at least two other patients among our cohort of HSE patients with reduced production of type I IFN following viral and dsRNA activation for further genetic investigation using a candidate gene approach. We have excluded UNC93B and TLR3 deficiencies in these patients based on sequence analysis suggesting the existence of mutations in genes other than those we have already identified. Further immunological testing revealed that these patients' fibroblasts showed a specific decrease in interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) dimerization consistent with the lack of IFN production. Sequencing and expression of all known genes in this critical pathway are in progress under the assumption that a mutation lies in one of these genes. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease thought to be initiated by an autoimmune Th1 and Th17 response specific to antigens of the central nervous system. Contrary to this, recent data suggest that neurodegenerative mechanisms are primary triggers of some forms of MS. In this scenario, a major role could be played by the release of potential self-antigens from dying oligodendrocytes (ODCs).To test this hypothesis we developed a mouse model (MOGiCre/ iDTR) that allows us to selectively initiate ODC cell death in an inducible manner by transgenic expression of a diphtheria toxin receptor in ODCs and peripheral injection of diphtheria toxin (DT). Injection of DT resulted in pronounced demyelination, and was clinically characterized by ataxia, tremor, development of a hunchback and complete paralysis. Due to the massive demyelination at the peak of the disease a dramatic neuronal degeneration was observed. Surprisingly, many of the diseased mice recovered completely even after complete hind limb paralysis. The later may be a result of an accumulation of ODC precursors in the demyelinated brain areas, as observed by us. None of the sick animals showed signs of classical EAE or brain infiltration of immune cells, although the animals showed an activation of microglia followed by strong gliosis. Thus, we investigated whether and under which conditions dying ODCs release antigens that can prime T-cell responses towards myelin. Injection of CFSE-labeled, MOG-reactive Tcell receptor transgenic cells showed no or only moderate T-cell proliferation after ablation of ODCs. In addition, release of antigen by dying ODCs did not lead to tolerance induction.We conclude that factors in addition to ODC-death lead to the neurological symptoms observed in EAE, and that at least in mice, dying of ODCs does not contribute to EAE induction or even tolerance.",
