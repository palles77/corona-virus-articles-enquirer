It is increasingly apparent that NCDs are actually communicable conditions, and although the vectors of disease are nontraditional, the pandemic label is apt. Arguing for a change in terminology extends beyond pedantry as the move carries serious implications for the public health community and the general public. Additional resources are unlocked once a disease reaches pandemic proportions and, as a long-neglected and underfunded group of conditions, NCDs desperately require a renewed sense of focus and political attention. This paper provides objections, definitions, and advantages to approaching the leading cause of global death through an alternative lens. A novel framework for managing NCDs is presented with reference to the traditional influenza pandemic response.",

The latter two have unseated lung infections and diarrheal diseases from the top 10 since 1990. Over the same period the number of deaths from NCDs has increased from 27 million to 38 million, currently representing 70% of all global mortality [1] . Once confined to a clutch of high-income countries, NCDs are now the leading cause of death in developed and developing countries alike.",
