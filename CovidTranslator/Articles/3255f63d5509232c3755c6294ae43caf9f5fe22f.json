Emergency Department (ED)-based syndromic surveillance systems have been introduced for early detection of infectious outbreaks. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a forecasting model of respiratory infectious disease outbreaks based on a nationwide ED syndromic surveillance using daily number of emergency department visits with fever. Methods: We measured the number of daily ED visits with body temperature \u2265 38.0\u00b0C and daily number of patients diagnosed as respiratory illness by the ICD-10 codes from the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) database of Seoul, Korea. We developed a forecast model according to the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method using the NEDIS data from 2013 to 2014 and validated it using the data from 2015. We defined alarming criteria for extreme numbers of ED febrile visits that exceed the forecasted number. Finally, the predictive performance of the alarm generated by the forecast model was estimated. Results: From 2013 to 2015, data of 4,080,766 ED visits were collected. 303,469 (7.4%) were ED visits with fever, and 388,943 patients (9.5%) were diagnosed with respiratory infectious disease. The ARIMA (7.0.7) model was the most suitable model for predicting febrile ED visits the next day. The number of patients with respiratory infectious disease spiked concurrently with the alarms generated by the forecast model. Conclusions: A forecast model using syndromic surveillance based on the number of ED visits was feasible for early detection of ED respiratory infectious disease outbreak.",

If the observed number of febrile ED visits exceeded the upper 95th percentile of the average number of febrile ED visits according to day-of-week during 2013 and 2014, we defined it as the second criteria. If the daily number of febrile ED visits satisfied both alarm criteria, we activated the forecast alarm. We established 3 alarm durations: 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day alarms. For example, if 7-day alarm is activated, alarming lasts until the 7th day from the day of most recent alarm generation. We simulated and validated the forecast model using ED-based syndromic surveillance from the data of 2015. We also tested the correlation between the number of observed febrile ED visits and patients diagnosed with infectious respiratory disease as their final diagnosis in ED.",

For respiratory infectious diseases, monitoring the number of patients diagnosed with respiratory infectious disease might be a more accurate indicator to predict respiratory infectious disease outbreak than monitoring the number of febrile patients at ED presentation. However final diagnosis at ED is difficult to collect in a timely manner, resulting in time delay of detection for outbreak. In the NEDIS system, time to complete collection of ED final diagnosis information takes up to 14 days from day of ED admission and differs according to each hospital. By contrast, body temperature is checked for all patients during initial triage after ED arrival, and body temperature informati0n is sent to the central NEDIS server directly with triage information without time delay. Body temperature can be used intuitionally for diagnosis or chief complaint without additional data cleaning and coding procedures. After MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea, thermal scanning devices were installed for the mass screening of febrile patients entering EDs. Until now there has been no universal guideline for screening and alarming based on information obtained from thermal scanning in EDs. The volume of febrile ED patients could be estimated automatically by thermal scanning device, and application of thermal skin device to the forecast model using ED-based syndromic surveillance may be an efficient method of monitoring the outbreak of respiratory infectious disease.",
