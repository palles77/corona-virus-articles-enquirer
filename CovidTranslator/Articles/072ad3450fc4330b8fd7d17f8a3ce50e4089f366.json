The virus is believed to have originated from bats and transmitted to human through intermediate animals such as civet cats. The re-emergence of SARS-CoV remains a valid concern due to the continual persistence of zoonotic SARS-CoVs and SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) in bat reservoirs. In this study, the screening for the presence of SARS-specific T cells in a cohort of three SARS-recovered individuals at 9 and 11 years post-infection was carried out, and all memory T cell responses detected target the SARS-CoV structural proteins. Two CD8 + T cell responses targeting the SARS-CoV membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were characterized by determining their HLA restriction and minimal T cell epitope regions. Furthermore, these responses were found to persist up to 11 years post-infection. An absence of cross-reactivity of these CD8 + T cell responses against the newly-emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was also demonstrated. The knowledge of the persistence of SARS-specific celullar immunity targeting the viral structural proteins in SARS-recovered individuals is important in the design and development of SARS vaccines, which are currently unavailable.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first emerged 12 years ago as a highly contagious infectious disease, caused by a then novel human coronavirus, termed SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] . The virus spread to 25 countries in a short period of three months, affecting a total of 8098 people globally including 774 deaths, a fatality rate of 10% [2] . SARS-CoV is believed to have originated from bats [3] [4] [5] and transmitted to human through intermediate animals such as civet cats [6] . Although no SARS cases have been reported since 2004, the re-emergence of SARS-CoV is of public health concern due to the continual persistence of SARS-CoVs ) and 8 accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9) proteins [7] . Animal studies have indicated the importance of T cells in the clearance of SARS-CoV during primary infection and protection from disease [8] [9] [10] . In humans, decreased T cell numbers (lymphopenia) correlated with severe disease, indicating the critical role of T cell-mediated immune response in disease development [11, 12] . While SARS-specific antibody level in SARS-recovered individuals is undetectable at 6 years post-infection, SARS-specific memory T cells persisted up to 6 years following recovery [13] . The long-term persistence of memory T cell immunity could be important in protection against SARS-CoV re-infection. In this study, the presence of SARS-specific T cells was screened in three SARS-recovered individuals at 9 and 11 years post-infection. characterization of CD8 + T cell responses against the structural M and N proteins was carried out, including the determination of HLA restriction and the minimal T cell epitope. In addition, crossreactivity of SARS-specific CD8 + T cells against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was investigated.",

Analysis of ELISpot results was performed with the positive threshold set as the number of spot-forming units (SFU) two times above the mean SFU of unstimulated cells. As shown in Fig. 1 , higher frequencies of IFN\u2425producing SFUs were observed for in vitro-expanded PBMCs from SARS subject 1 compared to the healthy individual, suggesting the presence of SARS-specific memory T cells at 9 years post-infection. These responses were low in frequency since in vitro expansion of PBMCs was required for their detection. This is in agreement with previous reports that reported the decline of memory T cell responses in SARS convalescent individuals over time [13, 15] .",

Three are CD4 + T cell responses, of which two recognized the S protein (S104 and S109) and one recognized the N protein (N21). In addition, CD8 + memory T cell response specific for the SARS-CoV M protein (M29) was detected. Subsequently, PBMCs were obtained from two other SARS-recovered individuals (SARS subjects 2 and 3) at 9 and 11 years post-infection respectively and screened for SARS-specific memory T cells using the same method. Memory T cell responses specific against SARS-CoV structural proteins were also found ( Table 1) . As with that observed in SARS subject 1, N21 CD4 + response and M29 CD8 + response were found in SARS subjects 2 and 3, respectively. SARS subject 3 also possessed a CD4 + T cell response targeting S217. As summarized in Table 1 , subject 1 had more SARS-specific memory T cells at higher frequencies compared to the other two subjects. It was noted that subject 1 had more severe disease presentation (Supplementary Table 2 ), which could be related to the more robust T cell responses detected. However, the number of subjects recruited in this study is too small to draw a conclusion to this correlation. The knowledge that SARS-CoV structural proteins are highly immunogenic in eliciting protective and immunodominant T cell responses is well-established [16] [17] [18] . The CD4 + T cell epitopes identified here, which are specific against S104 (S protein residues 516-530), S109 (S protein residues 541-555), S217 (S protein residues 1081-1095) and N21 (N protein residues 101-115), have been previously reported from a cohort of SARS-recovered patients at 1 year post-infection, suggesting the immunoprevalence and dominance of these responses in convalescent SARS patients [16] . Here, the identification of T cell responses against SARS-CoV structural S, N and M proteins at 9 and 11 years post-infection suggests the long-term persistence of these responses.",

Using T cells from subject 1, the M29 CD8 + T cell response was determined to be restricted by the HLA-B*1502 allele. As revealed by ICS, M29restimulated CD8 + T cells exhibited CD8 + IFN\u2425 + response at 27.6% when stimulated with M29 peptide (Fig. 2, left panels) . Additionally, CD107a expression of T cells induced by M29 peptide was determined to be 12.7% (Fig. 2, right panels) . The increase in CD107a expression, a marker for T cell degranulation and target cell-killing function via the perforin-granzyme pathway [19] , indicates that the memory T cells were capable of degranulation and likely to exhibit target cell-killing function upon activation by M29 peptide. Table 1 Summary of T cell responses in SARS-recovered subjects at 9 or 11 years post-infection, identified from screening by ELISpot and confirmation by ICS. Percentages of T cell responses represent that of CD4 + or CD8 + T cells over total T cell population after in vitro expansion in the presence of SARS peptide mixtures. HLA class I molecules preferentially bind and present peptides of 8-11 amino acids to be recognized by HLA receptors on CD8 + T cells during T cell activation [20] . Since the M29 peptide is a 15mer peptide, the identification of the position and minimal number of amino acids within the M29 region, known as the minimal epitope, capable in eliciting the M29 CD8 + T cell response was carried out. To do so, truncated peptides within the M29 region ranging from 8-to 12-mers were tested for their abilities to induce IFN\u2425 secretion by M29-restimulated T cells. As shown in Table 2 , the 9-mer peptide, M29 147-155 , corresponding to residues 147-155 of M protein, was most efficient in inducing the CD8 + T cell response, resulting in the highest percentage of IFN\u2425-producing cells of 32.9%. This 9-mer also represents the minimal epitope of M29 CD8 + T cell response, as the removal of either the N-terminus histidine (H) residue (M29 148-155 ) or the C-terminus leucine (L) residue (M29 145-154 ) completely abolished IFN\u2425 production ( Table 2) .",

            "text": "A novel human coronavirus, MERS-CoV, first emerged in 2012 [26, 27] . Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is a betacoronavirus which causes serious and sometimes fatal lower respiratory tract infections and extrapulmonary manifestations [28, 29] . Contrary to SARS-CoV which is a lineage B betacoronavirus, MERS-CoV belongs to lineage C [30] . To investigate if SARS-specific M29 and N53 CD8 + T cells can cross-react with M and N peptides of MERS-CoV, sequence alignments were done to identify corresponding M29 and N53 minimal epitopes of MERS-CoV ( Fig. 4A and B) . When M29and N53-restimulated T cells were stimulated with MERS-CoV M29 minimal epitope peptide (HLKMAGMHF) and N53 minimal epitope peptide (TKSFNMVQAF), no CD8 + IFN\u2425 + responses were observed (Fig. 4C) , indicating the inability of these SARS-specific T cells to be activated by MERS-CoV peptides. Therefore, T cell immunity against SARS-CoV is highly specific and M29 and N53 CD8 + T cell responses are unlikely to provide cross-protection against MERS-CoV infection. This is expected as MERS-CoV is distantly related to SARS-CoV and is more closely related to other bat coronaviruses [30] . Nonetheless, sequence alignments revealed that the M29 and N53 minimal epitopes are fully conserved between human and zoonotic strains (Fig. 4A and B) , including civet SARS-CoV SZ3, bat SL-CoVs Rp3 and Rf1, and the bat SARS-CoV Rs3367 which is capable of utilizing both human and bat ACE2 receptors for cell entry [5] . Hence, it is likely that the SARS-specific M29 and N53 CD8 + T cells can confer cross-protection against infections of these zoonotic SARS-CoV and SL-CoV strains.",

In this study, it was demonstrated that SARS-specific memory T cells persist in three SARS-recovered individuals at 9 and 11 years post-SARS in the absence of antigen. All memory T cells detected were specific against SARS-CoV structural S, N and M proteins. Two immunodominant CD8 + T cell responses specific against M (M29) and N (N53) proteins were further characterized by defining the minimal epitope and HLA restriction. These CD8 + T cell responses continued to persist in a SARS-recovered subject up to 11 years post-infection. The persistence of T cell responses suggests that SARS-recovered patients could be protected from re-infection.",
