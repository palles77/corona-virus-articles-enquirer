We will focus on the systems that are most useful for cell biologists, and discuss their advantages and limitations. Vacciniamediated expression can be used for assessing cellular localization, posttranslational modifications, oligomerization, and transport and turnover rates. The system provides a rapid method for screening mutant proteins for expression and targeting. It is an excellent way of quickly deciding which mutant proteins might be worth further study using stable expression systems. Some uses of vaccinia vectors will not be discussed here, including methods for largescale production of proteins. For detailed methods for large-scale production of proteins from cDNAs, or other vaccinia methods not discussed here, see Earl and Moss (1991) , Moss er al. (19901, and Moss (1991) .",

Widespread vaccination with vaccinia virus (probably derived from cowpox virus) resulted in the worldwide eradication of smallpox. The double-stranded linear genome of vaccinia virus is nearly 200 kb, and there are over 250 potential genes (Goebel et al., 1990; Moss, 1991) . The virions are enveloped and are approximately 200 x 300 nm in size, with a characteristic brick shape (Fig. 1) . Several features of the vaccinia life cycle make it unique as a eukaryotic expression vector, At least 25 kb of DNA can be inserted into the vaccinia genome without detrimental effects on viral replication or assembly. Vaccinia replicates completely within the cytoplasm of the host cell, and thus imports or directs the synthesis of its own polymerases and transcription factors. In addition, the virus has a wide host range, so most cultured mammalian cell lines are susceptible to infection. The virus is easy to grow and purify in large quantities, and is relatively safe to work with.",

            "text": "Considering the size of vaccinia virus, the complexity of replication and assembly is not surprising (Figs. 1 and 2) . After binding to the host cell, the viral envelope is believed to fuse directly with the plasma membrane (Doms et al., 19901 , releasing the core virion into the cytoplasm. Little is known about the uncoating steps, but transcription of early genes begins within 1 hr of infection. The virion core contains all the enzymes it needs for transcription of the early genes. Transcribed RNAs are capped, methylated, and polyadenylated in the cytosol by viral enzymes. DNA replication begins with 3-4 hr, and occurs in discrete juxtanuclear regions of the cytosol termed \"viral factories\" near the Golgi complex. After transcription of intermediate and late viral genes (by different viral RNA pol ymerases), viral assembly begins. This complex process appears to involve two separate membrane \"enwrapping\" events, each of which results in a double lipid bilayer surrounding the core particle. The first double membrane is derived from the \"intermediate compartment\" between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi (Sodeik er al., 1993) . The viral DNA is inserted into a crescent-shaped region of the intermediate compartment membrane which then fuses around it, generating intracellular mature virus (IMV), formerly called intracellular \"naked\" virus. The second enwrapping membranes are derived from the trans-Golgi network (Schmelz et al., 1994) plasma membrane, releasing virions with three membranes into the extracellular space. However, some strains of vaccinia are inefficiently released from cells. Approximately 95% of the commonly used WR strain remains cell associated. Other strains (e.g., IHD-J) produce substantial amounts of extracellular virus. Since both forms of intracellular virus (singly and doubly enwrapped) are infectious, virus is usually purified from cell homogenates rather than from the culture medium.",

The T7 RNA polymerase is expressed efficiently in the cytoplasm early after infection. Transfection of cells immediately after infection with a vector containing the gene of interest cloned behind a T7 promoter results in rapid and efficient expression of the encoded protein.

This plasmid is then transfected into vaccinia-infected cells. Homologous recombination of the plasmid and the vaccinia genome generates a recombinant virus with an inactive TK gene. A lysate from the infected cells is used to infect a thymidine kinase negative (TK-) cell line, usually human osteosarcoma 143B cells (Mackett et ul., 1984) . Recombinant viruses are enriched by growing the cells in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), since only recombinant viruses (and TK mutants) are able to replicate. If the plasmid transfer vector used for recombination contains the P-galactosidase gene (see subsequent discussion), recombination viruses can be distinguished from TK mutants by color screening using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-@-~-galactoside (X-gal; Chakrabarti et ul., 1985) .",

The use of an early vaccinia promoter to drive the foreign gene is essential for cell biology applications, since the protein will be expressed before most of the cytopathic effects of the virus infection become evident. The vector we use for production of recombinant virus is pSCl Iss (Fig. 4A ) or its derivative pSC65. pSCl lss contains the promoter P,., that is transcribed both at early and late times after infection; pSC65 contains a synthetic earlyhate promoter. Following the promoter is a short polylinker into which the foreign gene is cloned. Another vaccinia promoter, P,, (a late promoter), drives expression of the bacterial @-galactosidase gene and allows color screening of plaques to help identify recombinants.

The 5' and 3' untranslated regions should be kept short. Also, it is important to check for a transcription termination sequence that is recognized by the early RNA polymerase. The sequence TTTTTNT (T,NT, where N can be any nucleotide) will cause termination of transcripts about 50 bp downstream (Yuen and Moss, 1987) . Thus, silent mutations that eliminate any T,NT sequences should be introduced by site-directed mutagenesis prior to subcloning. Although proteins can still be expressed from recombinant viruses made with pSCl Iss or pSC65 when their cDNAs contain T,NT sequences, expression will only occur during the late phase of virus infection (A) pSCllss is used for producing vaccinia recombinants. The foreign gene (with its own start and stop codons) is subcloned into the Stic I or Sol I sites behind the vaccinia P7,1i promoter. (B) pAR2529 is used for T7 polymerase-mediated expression after infection with vTF7-3 (Section 1V.A). Other plasmids such as pBluescript (Stratagene) can also be used: however, the absence of the T7 polymerase terminator sequence and the presence of the G-C rich region in the Bluescript polylinker upstream of the foreign gene can reduce mRNA production and consequently decrease protein expression.",

We have had this problem with several proteins that accumulate in the intermediate compartment and cis-Golgi network. Either the recombinant is never obtained, or DNA encoding the foreign gene is lost, giving the virus a growth advantage over virus that still contains the foreign gene. In this case, one alternative is to use adouble infection system (Moss el al., 1990; Earl and Moss, 1991) . The cDNA encoding the foreign gene is cloned into a recombination vector with the T7 RNA promoter instead of the P,,s promoter (pTM-I), and a recombinant virus is produced as described already. Since the protein is not expressed, it will not inteifere with recombinant virus production. Expression is mediated by co-infecting the cells with another vaccinia virus encoding T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7-3). Alternatively, the infection/transfection system can be used (Section IV,B). 2b.

The expression level of each protein can be varied with the amount of virus or DNA used, depending on the method of expression (e.g., Zagouras et ul., 1991) . 4. Because this expression system operates cytoplasmically, it can be used to express genes from RNA viruses that contain cryptic splice sites that are used when the cDNA is inserted into a vector that must be transcribed in the nucleus (Machamer and Rose, 1987) . 5. Infection with recombinant vaccinia viruses results in high expression levels in >90% of cells on a dish soon after infection. This method is therefore ideal for subcellular localization of expressed proteins by immunoelectron microscopy (Machamer et d . , 1990; Krijnse Locker et d., 1992) . Early times postinfection (<6 hr) should be analyzed to avoid complications from viral cytopathic effects. Localization of proteins expressed via the vaccinia-T7 polymerase hybrid system is more difficult since the celluIar morphology can be altered by the DNA carriers used for transfection, especially cationic lipid. 6. Vaccinia virus-mediated expression can be useful for production of biologically active proteins. Because proteins are expressed in mammalian cell lines, glycosylation and other post-translational modifications that may be necessary for activity are preserved.",

            "text": "1. A serious disadvantage of the vaccinia virus system is that the expression level may be so high that it overwhelms cellular translation and translocation machinery. This can result in decreased efficiency of membrane translocation, post-translational modifications, and transport through the secretory pathway. At very high expression levels, newly synthesized proteins that enter the secretory pathway may accumulate in the ER. We have observed reduced rates of transport of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein to the cell surface, compared with VSV-infected cells, when the protein is expressed with the vaccinia-T7 hybrid system (Fig. 7) . Whereas VSV G becomes resistant to endoglycosidase H (as it moves through the Golgi complex) with a half-time of <25 min in VSV-infected HeLa cells, the half-time is considerably slower (-40 min) in vTF7-3-infected and -transfected cells. The difference in transport kinetics may be less dramatic in other cell types.",

For example, an early effect of the infection is rounding of cells (probably due to changes induced in the cytoskeleton), which can make conventional immunofluorescence difficult to interpret (Fig. 6 ) . In addition, host cell protein synthesis is inhibited in infected cells. Vaccinia encodes homologs of cellular proteins including superoxide dismutase, epidermal growth factor, and profilin (Goebel et al., 1990) , expression of which could affect cell morphology and behavior in unpredictable ways. Although viral DNA replication and early assembly steps can be blocked (by treating infected cells with hydroxyurea or rifampicin, respectively), early cytopathic effects such as cell rounding are unfortunately not prevented.",

HeLa cells grown in 35-mm dishes were infected with vTF7-3 followed by LipofectACE-mediated transfection with 2 pg pAR/G per dish, as described in Section IV,B, or with VSV (20 pfuicell). At 3.75 hr postinfection. cells were rinsed once in PBS, starved for 15 min in methionine-free DMEM. and pulse-labeled for 5 min with 50 pC \"S in uioo-labeling mix (Amersham) in 0.5 mi methionine-free DMEM per dish. Cells were chased in growth medium. At the indicated chase times, individual dishes were lysed in detergent solution and immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-VSV antibody, as described in Section IV.C.1. Samples were eluted in 20 pI 50 m M Tris pH 6.8. 1% SDS for 3 min at 100\u00b0C. Eluents were divided in half, and either 10 &I 0.1s M citrate, pH 5.5, or the same amount of buffer containing 0.3 mU endoglycosidase H (endo H) was added. After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C. concentrated Laemmli sample buffer with 0-mercaptoethanol was added; the samples were heated to 100\u00b0C for 3 min and electrophoresed on Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The percentage of VSV G protein that was resistant to endo H at each time point was quantitated by densitometric scanning of fluorographed gels. Nettleman, 1989) . BL-2 restrictions also apply. If available, a virus-only laminar flow hood is recommended to avoid accidental infection of cell lines during routine tissue culture, although we have not had problems with accidental infection when the ultraviolet light is left on for an adequate time following work with infected cells.",
