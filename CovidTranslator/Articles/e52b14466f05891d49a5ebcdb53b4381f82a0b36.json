Some viruses (e.g., influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus) are clearly associated with pulmonary exacerbations and worsening lung function in healthy children and in children with cystic fibrosis [6] .",

Other viruses such as adenovirus (19/154 of positive samples) or Enterovirus (15/154) can be found in the respiratory tracts of even asymptomatic children and can persist for months after respiratory infection [9, 10] . By contrast, other viruses detected in our study such as parainfluenza (11/154), influenza (9/154), respiratory syncytial virus (5/154), and metapneumovirus (3/154) are usually present only in symptomatic children and are very rare in healthy children [11, 12] .",
