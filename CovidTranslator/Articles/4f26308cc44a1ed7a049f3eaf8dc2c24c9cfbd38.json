Adoptive transfer of these polyclonal CD4 \u00f7 T cells from immunized mice prevents death in lethally infected recipients without significantly reducing virus titer in the central nervous system (CNS). These observations raise the possibility that the recruitment of mononuclear cells into the CNS may play a critical role in survival from a lethal CNS infection. Transient DTH response to nonviral antigens induced an accumulation of monocytes in the CNS that was maximal at 48 h post-challenge and virtually resolved by 5 days post-challenge. By contrast the induction of prolonged DTH responses resulted in the accumulation of a large number of monocytes that persisted in the CNS for at least 5 days post-challenge. Neither type of DTH reaction suppressed virus replication or prevented death from concomitant lethal JHMV infection.",

            "text": "Many viral infections are accompanied by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses; however, the role of the DTH response in viral pathogenesis or resistance is unclear (Liew, 1982) . DTH is an antigen-specific response mediated by T cells which express the CD4 cell surface marker and respond to antigen presented in the context of major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II molecules. Antigen-induced activation of TDT H cells results in the release of lymphokines, increased vascular permeability and the local accumulation of antigen-nonspecific monocytes (Liew, 1982; Askenase and Van Loveren, 1983; Geczy, 1984) . Our laboratory has previously shown that the adoptive transfer of CD4 \u00f7 cell TDT H clones specific for the neurotropic JHMV strain of mouse hepatitis virus protects mice from death due to a lethal infection . Protection requires only a small number (5 x 104) of these clonal T cells, is MHC class II (I-A) restricted, is prevented by immunosuppression of the host and results in the accumulation of large numbers of perivascular mononuclear cells . These characteristics are consistent with the induction of a DTH response (Liew, 1982) . The data suggest that the DTH-stimulated local accumulation of monocytes within the central nervous system (CNS) may play a pivotal role in providing protection to the host from a lethal infection. In addition, protection was not accompanied by a reduction of virus in the CNS, which suggests that the DTH response may play a role in the establishment of persistent JHMV infection in the CNS, leading to chronic JHMVinduced demyelination (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981) .",

The CD4* phenotype and MHC restriction of TDT H cells are identical to T cells that provide help in the augmentation of both antiviral antibody and the CTL responses. Although adoptive transfer of JHMV-specific CD4 + T cell clones prevents death from lethal JHMV infection, it does not result in a significant increase in serum antiviral antibody titer, suggesting that protection is not due to T cell-mediated help provided to antibody producing B cells . CTL responses are pivotal in protection and reduction of viral titer in several systemic infections (Sethi et al., 1983; Byrne and Oldstone, 1984; Morrison et al., 1986) . Although JHMV-specific CTL have been recently described (Kyuwa et al., 1988) , it is not clear if they play a significant role in protection from lethal JHMV infection.",

In this paper we demonstrate that JHMV elicits an /-A-restricted, CD4* T cell-mediated DTH response that provides protection from lethal infection upon adoptive transfer to naive recipients. However, the induction of DTH responses by nonviral antigens resulting in the recruitment of monocytes into the CNS during a lethal JHMV infection is not protective. This suggests that the antigen-nonspecific components of a DTH response in the CNS are not critical to survival from lethal JHMV infection.",

The T cells were cloned by limiting dilution and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 50/~g/ml of streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 5 x 10 -5 M 2-mercaptoethanol, JHMV antigen, irradiated (2000 Rad) syngeneic spleen cells as a source of antigen-presenting cells, and partially purified mouse interleukin-2 (Woodward et al., 1984) . The clone used in this report is designated 4BI0 and has the cell surface phenotype Thy-l.2 +, Lyt-l.2 +, CD8-and CD4 + (Woodward et al., 1984; Stohlman et al., 1986) . One passage prior to use, the 4B10 clone was cultured in the presence of ultraviolet-inactivated JHMV antigen to prevent carry-over of infectious virus. Viable cells were isolated by centrifugation on Lympholyte M (Cedarlane Laboratories), and 1 x 10 6 cells were transferred i.c. to recipients on the same day as i.c. challenge with 5 x 103 pfu of JHM.",

To compare the JHMV-induced DTH response in the C57BL/6 mice used in our previous studies to that in other mouse strains, groups of 6-week-old mice of various strains were immunized with JHMV and challenged 5 days later. Table 1 shows that there are indeed strain-specific differences in responsiveness to JHMV using an identical immunization and challenge protocol. However, C57BL/6, which were previously reported to be low responders (Kyuwa et al., 1984) , are clearly high responders. The JHMV-induced DTH response is not linked to H-2, since CBA (H-2 k) and A.SW (H-2 s) responded, while C3H (H-2 k) and SJL (H-2 s) mice showed a minimal or no response, as previously reported (Kyuwa et al., 1984; Stohlman et al., 1985) .

To ensure that the active cells derived from the JHMV-immunized donors had the appropriate pattern of genetic restriction, nylon wool-purified T cells from JHMV-immunized C57BL/6 (H-2 b) donors were adoptively transferred to congenic strains and DTH responses were measured 24 h later.

These data show that histocompatibility at I-A is necessary for responsiveness and thus confirm that these cells have both the surface phenotype and genetic restriction typical not only of a TDT~ cell (Liew, 1982) but also of the JHMV-specific TDT H cell clones previously described (Woodward et al., 1984; Stohlman et al., 1986) .",

The other half of each group was monitored for survival. None of the immunized mice challenged with these nonviral antigens survived the concurrent JHMV infection, nor was there a reduction in CNS viral titer following challenge with KLH (Table 3 ). All mice died between 10 and 12 days post-infection, suggesting that the concurrent DTH responses had essentially no effect upon survival. Histological examination of both infected and uninfected mice immunized with these antigens and challenged i.c. revealed a peak of mononuclear infiltration within the CNS at 48 h following secondary challenge. However, the responses in uninfected mice had diminished to almost undetectable levels by the fifth day post-infection, indicating that the response to these nonviral antigens was transient. In comparison, JHMV infection results in a progressive increase in cellular infiltration in the CNS that is initially evident by 4 days post-infection ( Fig.  1A ; Weiner, 1973) . Thus, it is possible that the DTH-induced presence of monocytes within the CNS during the initial stages of JHMV infection was not of sufficient magnitude or duration to suppress virus replication or provide any substantial measure of protection.",

The increase was noted by 5 days post-infection (unpublished data). KLH, which resulted in the most vigorous DTH response as measured by footpad swelling, also induced the most vigorous cellular infiltration into the CNS (data not shown). To approximate the prolonged mononuclear infiltration seen during infection, KLH was emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant (KFCA), and injected into KLH-immunized mice. This resulted in a prolonged bilateral accumulation of mononuclear cells in the CNS that was not localized to the area of injection (Fig.  1C ). This vigorous response to KFCA in KLH-immunized mice had no apparent adverse clinical effects, and no deaths occurred. By contrast, naive mice receiving KFCA exhibited little perivascular cuffing or cellular infiltration in the CNS. Table  3 (experiment No. 3) shows that KFCA also elicited a vigorous DTH response in the footpad (70.0 :t: 11.0 \u00d7 10 -2 mm) in KLH-immunized mice, compared to naive mice (11.3 5:8.0 \u00d7 10 -2 mill). The phenotype of the TOT n cell reactive to KFCA is CD4 \u00f7 and Thy-1 \u00f7 (data not shown), identical to the cell responsible for the DTH response to KLH (Table 2) . KFCA injected i.c. into KLH-immunized mice co-infected with JHMV produced a prolonged cellular infiltration and perivascular accumulation of mononuclear cells consistent with a typical DTH response (Fig.  1D) ; however, it was unable to either confer survival or suppress virus replication (Table 3, experiment No. 3) . This further indicates that a DTH-induced accumulation of monocytes, even throughout the peak period of virus replication in the CNS, was not protective. In addition, no change in survival time was noted in KLH-immunized mice receiving KCFA i.c. with a concurrent JHMV infection compared to naive mice.",

We have sought to determine if the protection afforded JHMV-infected mice by the adoptive transfer of JHMV-specific CD4 \u00f7 T cells ) is due to the DTH-induced accumulation of antigen-nonspecific monocytes within the CNS. DTH responses are initiated by the interaction of CD4 \u00f7 T cells with antigen in an /-A-restricted manner, resulting in both T proliferation and the release of a variety of lymphokines. This is followed by an increase in vascular permeability and the local accumulation of bone marrow-derived antigen-nonspecific monocytes which produce a variety of monokines and hydrolytic enzymes (Nash and Geli, 1981; Liew, 1982; Askanase and Van Loveren, 1983; Geczy, 1983) .",

Transient responses early in infection were unable to suppress virus replication or confer survival to lethally infected mice, suggesting that the presence of monocytes early in infection did not alter the outcome of a lethal infection. KFCA was retained in the brain parenchyma and induced a persistent and panencephalitic DTH response in KLH-immunized mice. Mice exhibited perivascular cuffs of mononuclear cells resembling the response in JHMV-specific CD4 \u00f7 T cell clone recipients . However, in spite of clear evidence of a DTH response to KFCA by both footpad swelling and histological examination of the CNS, these mice also succumbed to a lethal JHMV infection. This indicates that the presence of increased numbers of monocytes throughout the infection was also unable to alter the course of the lethal disease. These data also suggest that the lymphokines released by the DTH-inducer T cells, the monokines and hydrolytic enzymes released by the monocytes and the loss of vascular permeability do not contribute directly to survival from a lethal JHMV infection.",

Although there are numerous virus infections in which macrophages are believed to play a role in survival from lethal infections, it has recently been shown that mononuclear phagocytes do not play an important role in the clearance of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Lehman-Grube et al., 1987) . JHMV replicates equally well in vitro in macrophages from both resistant and susceptible strains of mice (Stohlman et al., 1982b) . This is in contrast to both the MHV-2 and MHV-3 strains, whose in vitro replication in macrophages correlates with mouse strain-specific resistance (Bang and Warwick, 1970; Virelizier and Allison, 1976 ). In addition, macrophages from naive mice can suppress the replication of JHMV in a second susceptible cell line in vitro; however, we suggested that this suppression was not of critical importance in survival, since macrophages from both susceptible and resistant strains of mice suppressed virus replication to the same extent (Stohlman et al., 1982b) .",

In addition, mice surviving infection in the absence of virus reduction via the adoptive transfer of DTH-inducer T cell clones, nylon wool-purified DTH-inducer T cells or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have persistent JHMV infections with ongoing chronic demyelination (Buchmeier et al., 1984; Stohlman et al., 1986; unpublished observation) . Neither the DTH-inducer T cell clones or the nylon wool-purified T cells from mice immunized with JHMV exhibit demonstrable cytotoxic activity against virus-infected targets expressing MHC class I or class II molecules. Histological analysis of the CNS of mice protected by the adoptive transfer of T cell clone 4B10 suggests that mice are protected from death due to the inhibition of viral replication in neurons (unpublished data). A similar phenomenon has been previously described following protection mediated by the adoptive transfer of anti-JHMV monoclonal antibodies (Buchmeier et al., 1984) . These mechanisms may be different since protection afforded by DTH-inducer T cell clones does not alter the antiviral antibody response ; however, the effect, i.e., the reduction of neuronal infection appears to be similar. With the demonstration that the antigennonspecific components of the DTH response do not constitute a major protective mechanism in JHMV infection, efforts are now being directed toward understanding the role of viral-specific immunity in survival from lethal JHMV infection.",
