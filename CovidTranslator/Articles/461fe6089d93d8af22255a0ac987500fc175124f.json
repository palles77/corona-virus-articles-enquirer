Toxic changes in the cytoplasm (basophilia, vacuolation and Dohle bodies) may also be present. -In a recent report, a nucleated cell count > 13 \u00d7 10 9 /L (13 000/\u03bcl) was highly sensitive and specific for septic peritonitis, although cats with FIP were not included. -Protein content characteristic of an exudate may be confirmed by Rivalta's test (see Feline infectious peritonitis). -Chyle -opaque and white to pink (slightly cloudy and straw-colored in fasting animals), SG variable, protein 2.0-7.0 g/L (20-70 g/dl), and total nucleated cell count < 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L (10 000/\u03bcl) containing a large number of small lymphocytes (chyle is comprised of lymph and chylomicrons). The fluid in the tube separates into a cream-like layer when refrigerated. Chylous effusions are also characterized by fluid triglyceride level greater than serum triglyceride level, fluid cholesterol level lower than serum cholesterol level, and a fluid cholesterol:triglyceride ratio < 1 (with the values measured in mg/dl). -Blood -cloudy and red (centrifugation results in a clear supernatant above red sediment), SG, protein and total nucleated cell count consistent with peripheral blood. Effusion may contain clots but does not clot further after withdrawal. Platelets disappear within several hours, and erythrophagocytosis by macrophages begins within 1 day, and this can be used to help age the effusion. -Bile -clear to cloudy and dark yellow with a green or orange tinge, SG > 1.018, protein > 25 g/L (2.5 g/dl), total nucleated cells > 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L (5000/\u03bcl) with cell composition similar to modified transudate, but may become a highly cellular septic exudate.

It may be a transudate, but total nucleated cells are often > 3 \u00d7 10 9 /L (3000/\u03bcl) with cell composition similar to modified transudate, and it may become a highly cellular septic exudate. \u2022 While in theory a specific disease process causes a specific type of fluid, in reality the type of fluid may vary somewhat. In particular, the disorders that generally cause pure transudates are occasionally associated with modified transudates, and vice versa. This may be due to modification of fluid production by concurrent disorders as well as variable criteria for characterizing the fluids. The implication of this fact is that a specific differential diagnosis should not be ruled out strictly on the grounds that the type of fluid is not the classic type for that disorder.",

Normal peritoneal fluid is a transudate (ultrafiltrate) that comes from interstitial fluid produced by local capillary beds, which diffuses across the serosa into the peritoneal cavity. The serosa is equally permeable to diffusion of the fluid back into the interstitium, but most is reabsorbed from the abdomen by uptake by lymphatics, especially of the diaphragm. The ultrafiltrate contains protein that is in equilibrium with plasma protein. The mechanisms that promote formation of subcutaneous edema will thus promote formation of peritoneal fluid.

Hypoalbuminemia occurs by the same mechanisms as in dogs, i.e. reduced hepatic production, or renal, gastrointestinal or cutaneous loss. Hypoalbuminemia severe enough to cause spontaneous effusions or edema (typically \u2264 10-15 g/L [1-1.5 g/dl) is rare in cats. As albumin levels drop there is a progressive risk for exacerbation of ascites formed by other mechanisms, for example, increased hydrostatic pressure. When spontaneous fluid accumulation occurs, subcutaneous edema may develop preferentially to pleural and peritoneal effusions. Peritoneal fluid is a transudate. -Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. This may occur from fluid overload, decreased arteriolar resistance, and increased venous pressure. Cats with fluid overload usually develop pulmonary or subcutaneous edema preferentially to pleural and peritoneal effusions. Fluid overload causes a transudate. -Portal venous hypertension is an increase in venous pressure unique to the abdomen. It is classified anatomically as pre-hepatic (which is also pre-sinusoidal), hepatic (pre-sinusoidal, sinusoidal, or post-sinusoidal), or post-hepatic (which is also post-sinusoidal) in origin. Anatomic location affects protein content of the ascitic fluid and is relevant to differential diagnoses. Pre-sinusoidal disorders usually cause a pure transudate. Sinusoidal and post-sinusoidal disorders increase hepatic sinusoidal pressure, which, in addition to portal hypertension, causes effusion of hepatic lymph from the hepatic lymphatics through the surface of the liver. Hepatic lymph is high in protein. Chyle in the peritoneal cavity is an uncommon nonspecific finding indicating that lymphatic rupture has occurred. Chylous effusion may occur with any of the basic mechanisms that promote peritoneal fluid production except for hypoalbuminemia. Most cases are caused by neoplasia, and fewer are caused by inflammation, right heart failure and liver disease. Other causes are rare in cats, including primary abdominal lymphangiectasia and traumatic rupture of a major lymphatic vessel.",

The gall bladder is small with gall bladder rupture and small-to-large with bile duct rupture.Abdominocentesis will reveal a dark bile-stained modified transudate to (usually septic) exudate containing high levels of bilirubin pigment with or without crystals. It should be noted that ascites in an animal that is icteric from pre-hepatic or hepatic causes also contains some bilirubin, because of diffusion of bilirubin from the blood into the ascitic fluid. If there is question as to whether the source of bile is the blood or the biliary tract, the bilirubin level in the abdominal fluid may be compared to serum, with a higher level in the fluid indicating biliary tract rupture. (In one case series of dogs and cats, bilirubin level in the fluid was consistently at least two times the serum level.)",
