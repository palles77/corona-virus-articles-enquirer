            "text": "Background: Patients with chronic inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma, are at higher risk for influenza-like illness (ILI) complications. Viral infections are known to trigger asthma exacerbations, but a thorough description of the clinical characteristics of ILI-associated asthma exacerbations and the role of viruses as a risk factor for severe exacerbation (SE) in ILI has not been published yet. Objective: To investigate risk factors for SE in patients with ILI and asthma. Methods: Patients with ILI symptoms were recruited from 6 hospitals of Mexico (LaRed sites) during 2010 to 2014. Those with a previous asthma diagnosis and ILI symptoms and who were 5 years or older were included. Patients were assigned as cases or controls based on symptoms reported. SE was defined when participants presented with wheezing or dyspnea and required hospitalization. Results: A total of 486 patients with ILI and a diagnosis of asthma were included. There were no differences in the proportion, number, or type of viral illness among those with and without SE. Those with SE were less likely to report ILI symptoms. Muscle pain and nasal drip were predictors for patients not progressing to SE. A delay in seeking medical care was associated with SE (odds ratio, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.46-5.88). Conclusion: The presence of a particular virus did not predict SE. ILI symptoms in asthma patients are not associated with severe exacerbation. Patients with asthma should be encouraged to seek early medical care when ILI symptoms are first noticed to prevent serious complications.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory infections are estimated to cause 3.9 million deaths annually; many of these infections present as influenza-like illnesses (ILIs), 1 which can be caused by many different respiratory viruses. In patients with asthma, respiratory viral infections lead to exacerbations, potentially placing the patient's life at risk and creating an economic burden to the patient, the health care system, and society. 2 Asthma exacerbations are responsible for half the cost of the disease and for 5000 deaths in the United States every year. 3 Several reviews suggest that viral infections are present in up to 50% of adult exacerbations and more than 60% of pediatric exacerbations. 4e6 It is estimated that the prevalence of asthma in Mexico is approximately 5% 7 ; however, there are no estimates of the economic impact of an asthma exacerbation. Despite strong evidence linking viral infections to asthma exacerbations, the mechanisms by which viral infections trigger exacerbations are not fully understood. 8 Despite virus-induced exacerbation being frequently cited, few studies have found this viral involvement in asthma exacerbation. 9e11 The association between viral infections and asthma exacerbations leads to questions regarding why some patients develop severe exacerbations and others do not. It is known that in hospitalized patients with ILIs, a comorbidity associated with severity is asthma. We hypothesized that certain viral infections, patterns of ILI symptoms, and laboratory values may identify patients who develop severe asthma exacerbations that require subsequent hospitalization.",

Recruitment occurred year round, and participants were enrolled in the study if they had at least 1 respiratory symptom and at least 1 of the following general symptoms: fever or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia, and/or chest pain. Once enrolled, participants had a baseline study visit to collect information on demographics, medical history, laboratory tests, and clinical care needed (outpatient, hospitalization, intensive care admission). Follow-up visits were performed on days 14 and 28 during which information on hospitalization, if any, was collected. This study was approved by the institutional review board of each participating institution; all study procedures were performed after obtaining written patient informed consent and corresponding written assent if appropriate.",

Predictors that were statistically significant in univariate analyses were selected for additional analyses with logistic regression to determine their independent association with the outcome.

            "text": "Although it is generally accepted that viral infections can be associated with asthma exacerbations, there is controversy about how frequently exacerbations are triggered by viral infections. Some studies report an association, particularly among children, whereas others have not found that viruses are associated with asthma exacerbation. 15e17 Multiple studies have implicated rhinovirus as an important trigger, especially among children. Rhinovirus infections were found to be associated with hospital readmissions attributed to asthma among children younger than 13 years, a frequent cause of hospital admission due to asthma among children younger than 5 years, 18 and associated with asthma exacerbations among children 2 to 17 years old. 11, 19 It has also been suggested that members of the Rhinovirus family might be more virulent and/or have a greater propensity to cause exacerbation. 20, 21 Given the aforementioned studies, we suspect that we were unable to detect an association because our patient population is mainly adults; therefore, our results are most relevant to adults with asthma, and perhaps we did not find a stronger association because all participants had ILI. Our findings suggest that viral infections alone are not the only contributors to adult asthma exacerbations, and efforts should instead be made to assess other factors known to be involved in severe exacerbations. Asthma control 13,22e25 and environmental allergens 26 together with viral infections are likely responsible for the risk factors for hospital admission. 11 We found that delaying medical care after onset of symptoms was associated with severe exacerbation. Receiving care might have prevented some asthmatic patients from having an exacerbation. Our results suggest that asthmatic patients should be assessed by a medical practitioner as soon as they develop ILI symptoms because delaying care might increase the risk of a severe exacerbation. Our findings mirror those from a recent study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention evaluation . Base model included the following covariates: age, sex, current smoke exposure, overweight or obese, delay since onset of symptoms until seeking treatment in days, and 14 symptom variables (fever, dry cough, cough with phlegm, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, bloodshot eyes, watery eyes, sneezing, nasal drip, nasal congestion, nausea, diarrhea, and malaise). Backwards stepwise regression was used to identify covariates eligible for inclusion in the model (P < .20) and allowed covariates with an adjusted P < .10 to be included in the final model. CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio. of the 2009 influenza pandemic, where they found that although most adults with underlying medical conditions were more likely to report ILI, they were not more likely to seek urgent medical attention compared with those who did not have an underlying medical condition. 27 Together, these findings suggest a need to better understand health careeseeking behaviors and barriers among these patients. We were unable to assess symptoms unique to severe exacerbations during viral infections because all participants in this study had ILI. That is, we had no control group of patients who did not have an exacerbation without ILI.",

Lymphocytopenia is more closely associated with viral infections. 28 The presence of increased leukocytes and neutrophils may be associated with the heterogeneous inflammatory response, possibly attributable to preexisting inflammation due to asthma that might be worsened by exposure to the virus. Production of chemokines by bronchial epithelium in response to a viral infection leads to the entry of neutrophils to the respiratory airways, as confirmed on experimental and naturally induced common cold among asthmatic patients. 29 Neutrophilia in the airways is associated with increased levels of elastase interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 and lactate dehydrogenase, a marker of epithelial injury, but also with bacterial exacerbations. Therefore, it is not always clear which mechanism drives the neutrophil elevation. Although these laboratory parameters are consistent with the high prevalence of viral infections among our patient population, these responses can also be seen in bacterial infections. 29, 30 Our results suggest that in patients with asthma and ILI, these laboratory tests might be useful to predict severe exacerbations, although we were not able to determine whether these increases occurred before the exacerbation and whether the patient has a viral or bacterial infection.",

However, after adjusting for age, current tobacco use, and sex, we did not find an association with exacerbations.

Asthma was self-reported with no information being collected on accuracy of diagnosis, prescribed medications, or adequacy of asthma symptom control. Information regarding environmental exposures was not collected beyond cigarette use and exposure or on pulmonary function. This information might have been valuable to accurately classify participants, particularly those with mild exacerbations.
