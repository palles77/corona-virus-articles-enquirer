Aim: To perform the molecular characterization of the G and F proteins of Brazilian wildtype BRSV strains derived from bovine respiratory infections in both beef and dairy cattle. Materials and Methods: Ten BRSV strains derived from a dairy heifer rearing unit (n \u00bc 3) in 2011 and steers of three other feedlots (n \u00bc 7) in 2014 and 2015 were analyzed. For the BRSV G and F partial gene amplifications, RT-nested-PCR assays were performed with sequencing in both directions with forward and reverse primers used. Results: The G gene-based analysis revealed that two strains were highly similar to the BRSV sequences representative of subgroup III, including the Bayovac vaccine strain. However, the remaining seven Brazilian BRSV strains were diverse when compared with strains representative of the BRSV I to VIII subgroups. The central hydrophobic region of the Brazilian BRSV G gene showed the replacement of conserved cysteines and other residues of importance to antibody reactivity. The deduced F gene amino acid sequences from the Brazilian BRSV strains showed changes that were absent in the representative sequences of the known subgroups. Viral isolation on the nasopharyngeal swab suspensions failed to isolate BRSV. Conclusion: Results suggest that these strains represent a putative new subgroup of BRSV with mutations observed in the immunodominant region of the G protein. However, further studies on these Brazilian BRSV strains should be performed to establish their pathogenic potential.",

This last domain consists of a highly conserved hydrophobic central region composed of 32 aas and four cysteines that form two disulfide bridges (Doreleijers et al. 1996) . Due to its high genetic variation, the G protein may be used for evolutionary analyses of BRSV strains (Valarcher et al. 2000) . Based on G gene analysis, BRSV strains were divided into four subgroups designated as A, B, intermediate or AB, and nontyped (Furze et al. 1994 , Schrijver et al. 1996 . Following, several studies have focused on the genetic evolution of BRSV on the basis of both G and F sequences and currently the BRSV strains are classified into subgroups I to VIII (Valarcher et al. 2000 , Klem et al. 2014 , Bertolotti et al. 2018 , Kre si c et al. 2018 .",

However, we could not perform in-depth analysis of the F gene in this study since the partial amplified sequences were not targeted to important domains of this gene, such as glycosylation sites and/or hydrophobic motifs. Although highly conserved, the detailed comparison of the sequences from the partial F gene of the BRSV strains in this study showed exclusive aa changes in relation to the prototype strains. Interestingly, the comparison of the BRSV strains with another previously described Brazilian strain revealed higher divergences (10.9% and 16.7% at the nt and aa levels, respectively). These results reveal the genetic diversity of the Brazilian BRSV strains, even from a conserved genomic region within the F gene of the virus. The partial G gene analysis showed that the Brazilian strains identified in this study are different from the Bayovac vaccine and other strains of the I to VIII subgroups, with nt divergences varying from 10.7 to 15.5% (11 to 26% at the aa level).

However, when compared with the BRSV sequences in this study, the nt divergences ranged from 15 to 17.3% (26 to 30% at the aa level). Although cut-off values at both the nt and aa levels are not currently established and considering that the nt differences observed in the BRSV prototype strains among each other vary from 5% to 16% (Sarmiento-Silva et al. 2012) , it is highly likely that the Brazilian strains in this study represent a putative new subgroup of BRSV. Furthermore, both G and F gene-based phylogenetic analyses showed major branches consisting of strains representative of each subgroup. However, a different branch in each tree held only the Brazilian strains identified in this study, reinforcing the hypothesis that these are representative of a new BRSV subgroup, tentatively named subgroup IX. Phylogenetic analyses of both the G and F genes also showed that the branches including the Brazilian BRSV strains were further subdivided into clusters according to the herd of origin. The G protein, when compared with the other BRSV proteins, such as F and N, has a higher rate of genetic variability (Valarcher et al. 2000) . Usually, it is possible to observe a very limited difference (Valarcher et al. 2000) or complete similarity between the BRSV strains found in animals of the same herd (Larsen 2000; Larsen et al. 2000) , revealing that a single virus or group of closely related viruses predominantly infect a given herd at a given time (Valarcher et al. 2000) . However, the UEL04-RP and UEL05-06RP strains, which were derived from the same feedlot and collected at the same time from BRD-affected steers, were 13.3% divergent at the nt level (23% at the aa level) between each other and grouped in different clusters. The UEL01-Me and 03-Me strains, also collected at the same time in the same dairy heifer rearing unit, were 100% identical to each other; however, when compared with the strain UEL02-Me, they demonstrated lower nt and aa (87% and 79%, respectively) similarity. These findings suggest that there are different lineages of BRSV circulating in Paran a state and even in a single herd at the same time.",

We expected to find a conserved hydrophobic domain between residues 173-186; however, substitutions of cysteines and other residues that have a great influence on immunological activity were observed. Additionally, the Brazilian BRSV strains lacked both the Asn 179 and Leu 183 residues, which were replaced by Lys and Ser, respectively. Cysteine residues are important factors for the intramolecular disulfide bond and steric structure of the protein. Cys 173 -Cys 186 and Cys 176 -Cys 182 constitute the outer and inner disulfide bridges, respectively, while Asn 179 is involved in three hydrogen bonds that link the two helices of the Cys 176 -disulfide bridge via backbone oxygen with the Leu 183 amide in the second helix (Doreleijers et al. 1996) . In addition, although the cysteine noose was shown to be unnecessary for effective virus infection both in vitro and in vivo (Teng and Collins 2002) , it was considered necessary for binding the virus to the cell (Akerlind-Stopner et al. 1990 , Valentova et al. 2012 . Therefore, it is likely that the lack of the three cysteines that were replaced by Leu, Tyr, and/or Arg and other residue mutations at positions 179 and 183 observed in the Brazilian BRSV strains in this study represent a loss of disulfide bridges and structural changes in the G protein.",

This demonstrated that natural in vivo infections with mutants lacking the four cysteines involved in the two disulfide bridges are possible. In contrast to previous Brazilian studies , the nasopharyngeal swabs from which these BRSV strains were obtained were negative for other respiratory tract pathogens, suggesting that these Brazilian BRSV strains might have induced the disease. Additionally, BRSV strains in this study were not isolated in cell culture, suggesting that these may be attenuated strains of the virus.

Changes in the BRSV G protein may even confer cross-protective immunity in animals infected with heterologous strains; however, some aspects such as the degree of protection, scope, and duration of immunity conferred by different subgroups are not yet fully known. The identification and characterization of genetically different BRSV subgroups circulating in beef and dairy cattle herds and further studies on their antigenic properties are critical to the adoption of effective strategies for the control and prophylaxis of BRD and to minimize economic losses. Only with the knowledge of classical and molecular epidemiology of BRSV in a region and/or in a country and the temporal distribution is it possible to implement and evaluate the efficiency of immunoprophylactic programs against BRSV infection in cattle herds around the world.",

A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories [\u00feG, parameter \u00bc 0.9582]). The analysis involved 102 nucleotide sequences. Bootstrap values higher than 60% are shown. Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying the Neighbor-joining and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach and then selecting the topology with a superior log likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 (Kumar et al. 2016).",
