Virions of the different genera differ greatly in size and shape (see Fig. 1 -3) and in chemical composition. In this chapter, we present brief descriptions of the chemical composition and structure of representative viruses of currently accepted genera. Since the first edition of this book was published, the wide exploitation of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and molecular hybridization has yielded much new information about viral proteins and nucleic acids, which has made it possible to relate chemical composition and viral structure in a meaningful way. Accordingly, we now bring the two together in a single chapter.",

            "text": "The most important viruses of genus Polyomavirus are polyoma, which is a virus of mice (review, Gross, 1970) and simian virus 40 (SV40), which was discovered by Sweet and Hilleman (1960) in cultures of monkey kidney cells. Although they are antigenically distinct, both viruses are oncogenic for rodents and both cause transformation of cells in culture (see Chapter 13). The virions are about 45 nm in diameter, have a sedimentation constant of 240 S, and contain about 3 X 10 6 daltons of DNA, that is, about 12% of the particles by weight (Murakami et al., 1968) . The remaining &2>% is protein; there are no detectable lipids or carbohydrates in the virions. molecular weights, are unrelated to the major capsid protein (B. Hirt and R. Gesteland, unpublished results). The exact location of each of the polypeptides within the virus particles is not known, but because the three smallest are relatively rich in basic amino acids, remain tightly attached to the viral DNA when the virions are dissociated in alkali (Anderer et al., 1968; Estes et al., 1971) , and are not found in \"empty\" particles (Frearson and Crawford, 1972) it seems clear that they are internal. Even though these internal proteins are integral parts of the virion, two lines of evidence suggest that they are not coded by viral DNA. First, comparison of the tryptic fingerprints of the proteins of purified polyomavirus and histone fractions of uninfected host cells shows correspondence of several peptides, and second, if cells are labeled with radioactive lysine before infection, the three small virus-associated polypeptides are labeled to a much greater extent than the capsid proteins (Frearson and Crawford, 1972) . The most likely interpretation of these results is that proteins which are present in host cells before infection are incorporated directly into virus particles. Presumably the other three or four polypeptides found in the virions are virus-coded capsid proteins.",

            "text": "Although polyoma virus and SV40 are similar morphologically, their DNA genomes have different base compositions [polyoma virus: 48% G + C (J. Smith et al, I960)) SV40: 4 1 % G + C (Crawford and Black, 1964) ] and do not hybridize with one another (Winocour, 1965) . However, the DNA molecules extracted from the viruses have virtually identical physical properties. In any preparation of polyoma virus or SV40 DNA, most of the molecules are double-stranded, circular and superhelical, with a molecular weight of about 3 X 10 6 daltons (see Fig. 3 -1 and Plate 3-2). These closed circular molecules are known as component I. Because each strand of the double helix is closed upon itself and is base-paired with its partner in the usual Watson-Crick fashion, the two strands are topologically joined and cannot be separated by conditions, such as high pH or temperature, which destroy hydrogen bonds. Consequently, component I DNA shows sedimentation properties which were at first rather puzzling, but for which satisfying explanations are now available (reviews by Vinograd and Lebowitz, 1966; Crawford, 1969, and see Fig. 3-1) . In neutral conditions, the DNA molecules have a sedimentation coefficient of about 21 S; at pH 12.5 or higher, all the base pairs are disrupted without the strands separating and the molecules collapse into dense supercoils, which sediment at 53 S (Vinograd ef al, 1965) . SV40 and polyoma virus DNA's contain about 5000 base pairs. As there are about ten base pairs per turn of the Watson-Crick helix, there must be about (actually 15-20) , is the form found in the virion. At pH >12.5 >11.5. (Modified from Vinograd and Liebowitz, 1966.) 500 turns in component I DNA. For some reason as yet unknown, but presumably connected with the mechanism of replication of the DNA, the component I DNA from both polyoma virus and SV40 contains fewer turns than usual at the moment of completion of the last phosphodiester bond. Consequently, the molecules are under strain, which is relieved by building 15-20 right-handed superhelical turns into each molecule (Vinograd et ah, 1965; Bauer and Vinograd, 1968) . When a single phosphodiester bond in one of the strands of component I DNA is broken, the superhelical turns are lost immediately, because free rotation around the phosphodiester bond opposite the break is possible and the deficiency of Watson-Crick turns can be rapidly corrected. Some \"nicked\" molecules (component II) are always found in preparations of viral DNA. These two components of viral DNA can be separated by two methods. First, component II PLATE 3-2. Papovaviridae. (bar = 0.5\u03bc\u03b7\u03af) . Molecules of SV40 DNA. SV40 DNA exists in two major forms. When it is isolated from the virus particles most of the DNA occurs in the configuration shown in A-as double-stranded closed circular molecules containing superhelical twists. If one of the DNA strands is broken, the superhelical twists are relieved and the molecule assumes a relaxed circular configuration (B) . (Courtesy Dr. P. Sharp.) is less compact than component I, and it sediments more slowly than the closed circular form in neutral conditions (see Fig 3-1) , so that the two forms can be resolved by sedimentation velocity centrifugation. Second, both components I and II bind intercalating dyes such as ethidium bromide or propidium diiodide; because of its closed circular structure, component I cannot bind as many molecules of the dyes per base pair as component II, and as a consequence the two forms of viral DNA have different buoyant densities when centrifuged to equilibrium in gradients of cesium chloride-ethidium bromide (Radloff et al., 1967) or cesium chloride-propidium diiodide (Hudson et al., 1969) (for preparative methods see review by Pagano and Hutchison, 1972) . Like component I, component II DNA carries both infectivity and transforming ability (Pagano and Hutchison, 1972) . 3. The Structure and Chemistry of the Virion Finally, it has been known for some time (reviews, Crawford, 1969; Winocour, 1969 ) that many preparations of polyoma virus DNA and some preparations of SV40 DNA, depending on the host cells used to grow the virus (Ritzi and Levine, 1970; Basilico and Burstin, 1971) , contain linear pieces of DNA. The source of some of these molecules may be component I DNA which has suffered a double-strand break; the majority, however, are pieces of host DNA which also weigh about 3 X 10 6 daltons (Michel et a\\., 1967; Trilling and Axelrod, 1972) . It is not known how these fragments become excised from the host genome and packed into viral coats (pseudovirions).",

The evidence for such a process comes from heteroduplex mapping and hybridization experiments; when the DNA extracted from SV40 grown at high multiplicity is examined by heteroduplex mapping, it is clear that as well as deletions, many inversions and substitutions have occurred (Tai et al., 1972) . While some of the substitutions may reflect rearrangements within the viral genome, others are due to recombination events between viral and host DNA which result in the incorporation of host sequences into the viral genome (Lavi and Winocour, 1972) . Virus stocks grown at low multiplicities do not show these changes. The meaning of all this is not clear. Certainly, it is enough to shake our confidence in the defined nature of SV40 DNA and causes us to be more fastidious in the ways we use to grow Adenovirus 79 virus. However, knowledge of the existence of the phenomenon may provide us with ways to explain how these two small viruses cause malignant transformation, one manifestation of which is the permanent integration of viral genomes into host DNA.",

Pyridine (10%), or heating at 56\u00b0C in the presence or absence of deoxycholate (Russell et al., 1971) , tends to release hexons in groups of nine from the faces of the icosahedron, and occasionally groups of five hexons encircling a solitary penton from one of the vertices of the particle.

A single penton or a single fiber will hemadsorb but not hemagglutinate because it is univalent; such \"incomplete hemagglutinin\" can be converted into \"complete hemagglutinin\" by artificial aggregation using antibody against another viral serotype, which will aggregate pentons by binding to group-specific antigenic determinants in the penton base. Nonstructural antigens (T antigens) are constantly present in transformed cells (see Chapter 13) and appear early and fleetingly during cytolytic infections. Cross-reactivity of T antigens allows subdivision of the human adenoviruses into subgroups of different oncogenicity (Table 3 -2) which correspond in general with the subgroups defined by hemagglutinating properties.",

The hexon, penton base, and fiber are composed of three distinct polypeptides with molecular weights of 120,000, 70,000, and 62,000 daltons, respectively, while two or three additional arginine-rich (but tryptophan-containing) proteins of molecular weight 46,000, 24,000, and 22,000 daltons are located in an inner core that makes up 20% of the mass of the virion (Maizel et al., 1968b) . Since each hexon has a molecular weight of about 350,000 daltons as determined by sedimentation coefficient in zonal centrifugation, it was concluded that the capsomer is a polymer con-\u03c4 \u03b7 , \u03a7 \u03a4 \u03a1 \u0393 \u039b \u03b7 HEM AGGLUTINATION C \" \u03c4 \u03b2 \u039c TRANSFOR-FIBER 84 3. The Structure and Chemistry of the Virion structed of three identical molecules of molecular weight 120,000 daltons. This has recently been elegantly confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies of crystallized hexon protein (review by Franklin et al., 1972) . The two or three other polypeptides often found in trace amounts in association with hexons (Maizel et ah, 1968b; Laver, 1970) are considered by Pereira and Skehel (1971) , but not by Everitt et al. (1973) , to be products of proteolytic cleavage of the hexon polypeptide.",

In fully intact virions that have been recently released from cells, the envelope forms a tight sheath around the capsid (Plate 3-6), but in aged preparations it often becomes larger and irregular, and separates from the capsid. Two concentric membranes can sometimes be distinguished (Plate 3-6). The outer envelope appears to be about 20 nm thick and shows a repeating unit structure sometimes visible as peplomers (Spring et al., 1968) . There is some evidence for a lipid-containing electron-lucent inner membrane which Roizman (1969a) suggests may be required for the capsid to acquire an affinity for the nuclear membrane and thus get its outer envelope. Under some conditions, nonenveloped particles occur in the cytoplasm, usually late in infection and probably because of breaks in the nuclear membrane. Such particles may become enveloped at cytoplasmic membranes or through the plasma membrane (Darlington and Moss, 1969) .",

Becker and Olshevsky (1971, 1972) noted eight main polypeptides in their gels of enveloped herpes simplex virus (Table 3 -3). These accounted for over three-quarters of the total virion protein; there were fourteen additional minor components. Three of the major polypeptides, all glycoproteins, were missing from naked virions; two arginine-rich core proteins were absent from virus grown under conditions of arginine starvation. Robinson and Watson (1971) resolved at least eight polypeptides in nonenveloped capsids of highly purified HSV-1. Using a different protocol for purification, Spear and Roizman (1972) reported no less than twenty-four proteins in the whole virion, of which one-half were glycoproteins in the envelope. In view of the problems associated with purification of herpesviruses and the possibility that some \"viral polypeptides\" may be products of degradation, aggregation, or incomplete glycosylation, confirmation is needed before acceptance of this high figure, particularly for the number of envelope glycoproteins. Nevertheless, contrary to earlier beliefs (Watson and Wildy, 1963), it is unlikely that there are any host proteins in purified virions, although the membranes of infected cells contain both host and viral proteins (Heine et ah, 1972 ).",

Calculation of the kinetics of reannealing between single strands of fragmented DNA that had been subjected to shearing before denaturation gave a molecular weight of 95 million daltons or slightly more, and revealed that there were no repetitive nucleotide sequences (Frenkel and Roizman, 1971). When HSV-1 DNA was denatured and sedimented in alkaline sucrose gradients, several discrete bands of single-stranded material were obtained, suggesting that the DNA was doublestranded and linear with no cross-linking but with breaks at specific points in the individual strands (Kieff et ai, 1971). All the breaks appear to be in one strand, and Frenkel and Roizman (1972b) suggest that HSV-1 DNA molecules exist in four forms, each consisting of one intact strand and one characteristically fragmented strand. Single strand breaks have also been reported to occur in the DNA extracted from Marek's disease virus (L. Lee et al, 1971).

The particles measure 260 X 160 nm, compared with 300 X 240 nm for vaccinia (Nagington and Home, 1962) . Sections show that the core is biconcave and that lateral bodies are present (B\u00fcttner et al., 1964) . Treatment of virions with alkali and selective staining of sectioned material demonstrates an internal structure within the core very like that produced by similar treatment of vaccinia virus (B\u00fcttner et al., 1964) . The most distinctive feature of orf virions is the threadlike structure which makes up their outer surface; a single long thread is wound around the rest of the particle as a rather loose spiral (Plate 3-9).",

These constitute a layer of surface tubules (measuring 10 X 5 nm) on the outside of the core. The failure of concanavalin A to agglutinate vaccinia virions (Zarling and Tevethia, 1971) suggests the absence of surface glycoproteins. According to Holowczak (1970) and Garon and Moss (1971) the carbohydrate component of the vaccinia glycoproteins (unlike those of enveloped RNA viruses-see below) does not vary according to the cell in which the virus is grown, but consists solely of glucosamine. Since vaccinia virions develop in sites remote from the cytoplasmic smooth membranes where cellular glycosyltransferases are located it is possible that the carbohydrate as well as the polypeptide moieties of the vaccinia glycoproteins are virus-specified.",

Degradation at pH 6.5 or by heating yields large subunits, free RNA, and an insoluble precipitate. The large subunits of ME virus sediment at 14 S, and can be further dissociated by urea treatment into 5 S subunits (molecular weights 440,000 and 88,000 daltons, respectively). The 5 S subunits (the capsomers) are protein molecules consisting of one each of three nonidentical polypeptide chains (VPl, VP2, VP3), that are generated by cleavage of a precursor polypeptide (see Chapter 6). Whereas the large 14 S subunits of ME virus are pentamers, the large subunits of FMDV, which sediment at 12 rather than 14 S, appear to be trimer s of similar monomeric subunits (Fig 3-4) . The protein-protein bonds in FMDV break along the edges of the triangular faces whereas with ME virus the bonds break so as to yield pentamer subunits. FIG. 3-4 . Picornaviridae. Diagram representing the dissociation of the icosahedral structure of ME virus (above) and FMDV (below) into 14 and 12 S subunits, respectively. These large subunits are pentamers (ME) or turners (FMDV) of monomeric capsomers, each of which consists of equimolecular amounts of VPl, VP2, and VP3. VP4, the smallest structural protein, is thought to be located at the edges, as shown; other experiments show that the capsomers are so arranged that VPl is at the vertices (of FMDV). (From Talbot and Brown, 1972.) Talbot and Brown (1972) suggest that the fourth structural protein of the virion (VP4) is located at the apposition of the faces of the icosahedron through which the twofold axes of symmetry pass (see Fig 1-2A and Fig. 3-4) . A combination of trypsin treatment and electron microscopy of the antibody-binding site of FMDV suggests that VPl is located at the vertices of the icosahedron.",

Empty virions (\"procapsids\") lack VP2 and 4, but have instead another protein designated VP0 (molecular weight 41,000 daltons). In the presence of guanidine, viral RNA synthesis is inhibited and procapsids accumulate in the cell; on reversal of the block VP0 is enzymatically cleaved to yield VP2 and VP4, and RNA associates with the four capsid proteins to yield infectious virions (Jacobson et ah, 1970; see Chapter 6).",

However, in a comparative study, Boulton and Westaway (1972) reported that the Flavivirus, Kunjin virus, and Sindbis virus yielded RNA's of similar molecular weights (4.2 million daltons), but that either could be split into two equal halves of 2.1 million daltons by treatment with 8 M urea.

Removal of the peplomers had no effect on the ESR spectra, indicating that they are not involved in determining the organization of the lipid. Calculations suggest that the lipid of the virion is disposed as a single bilayer of cholesterol and phospholipid. The inside of the envelope is lined by a 6 nm layer of protein (M) which can be clearly Visualized by electron microscopy beneath the 6 nm electron-lucent lipid layer in the smooth lipid-coated \"cores\" derived by stripping the peplomers from the virion with chymotrypsin or bromelain (Schulze, 1970 (Schulze, , 1972 Compans et ah, 1970b ; Plate 3-15). The M protein layer remains in situ when the lipid is removed from glutaraldehyde-fixed chymotrypsin cores with the nonionic detergent NP40 (Schulze, 1970 (Schulze, , 1972 . Orthomyxovirus.

Two glycoprotein peplomers, the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase, project from the envelope (Fig. 3-6) . The numbers of peplomers per virion have been calculated by measurement of their distribution in electron micrographs, based on different spacings on spherical virions of various sizes. The figures for spherical virions 120 nm in diameter, with a center-to-center spacing between the peplomers of 7 nm (Nermut and Frank, 1971 ) was 738 (Tiffany and Blough, 1970), compared with 620 hemagglutinin and 118 neuraminidase molecules calculated on chemical grounds (Webster and Laver, 1971) . The exact concordance is clearly coincidental, since the relative proportion of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subunits varies greatly in different strains of influenza A virus (Webster et al., 1968) , and a relatively small difference in the diameter of the virion would mean a substantial change in the number of peplomers. In electron micrographs, the peplomers often appear to be arranged in rows so that they form triangles and hexagons (Almeida and Waterson, 1967) .",

RNP extracted from influenza virions by detergent treatment occurs in three size classes that correspond to the size classes of RNA. Electron micrographs (Pons et al., 1969; Schulze, 1972; Compans et al., 1972a) indicate that the RNP is folded back upon itself in a hairpin-like manner and twisted into a double-helical structure with a single-stranded loop at one end ( Fig. 3-6) . The single helix is about 7 nm in diameter and the double helix 15 nm.",

Because of the high rate of genetic recombination observed with influenza virus, Hirst (1962) suggested that the genome might consist of several distinct molecules. It is now clear that this is indeed the case. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis resolves the RNA into six or seven single-stranded molecules of molecular weights ranging from about 0.35 to 1.0 million daltons and totaling nearly 5 million daltons (Bishop et al., 1971; Content and Duesberg, 1971) . Some electron micrographs suggest that the several pieces may be linked together into a single molecule in the virion; RNA from three strains, spread in the presence or absence of urea or formamide, had a mean length corresponding to a molecular weight of 2.5 to 2.9 million daltons and a maximum length corresponding to about 5 X 10 6 (Li and Seto, 1971). However, the RNP, like the RNA, occurs in several size classes. The seven component pieces of RNA do not result from random breakage, because doublestranded pieces of similar length are synthesized in the infected cell (Duesberg, 1968a; Pons and Hirst, 1969) and there is some degree of specificity in the hybridization of these double-stranded molecules with the corresponding singlestranded viral molecules (Content and Duesberg, 1971) .",

The detailed structure of the peplomers has not been determined, but Tiffany and Blough (1970) have made calculations of their probable number for particles of different dimensions, depending on the separation of the peplomers, which has been estimated as about 9 nm. Spherical particles 150 nm in diameter would then contain about ^50, those 300 nm in diameter about 3500 peplomers. The nucleocapsid can be readily extracted from paramyxoviruses as a single tube 1 \u03bc\u03c4\u03b7 long, composed of RNA and helically symmetrical repeating protein subunits (Hosaka et al., 1966) . The nucleocapsids obtained from different species of \"Paramyxovirus vary somewhat in flexuousness and in the pitch of the singlestart helix: 5 nm for Sendai virus, and 6 nm for measles and mumps viruses (Finch and Gibbs, 1970) . They are constructed of between 2400 and 2800 identical protein subunits each of molecular weight about 60,000 daltons (Mountcastle et a\\. r 1970), with an hour-glass shape and arranged in the helix at an angle of 60\u00b0 to the long axis of the nucleocapsid. There are eleven or thirteen subunits in each turn of the helix (Finch and Gibbs, 1970) . By examining nucleocapsids with a tilted stage, Compans et al. (1972b) determined that the sense of the helices of both SV5 and mumps virus was left-handed. Another less flexuous form of nucleocapsid, in which the subunits have molecular weights of 43,000 to 47,000 daltons, is found after treatment of infected cells by trypsin. Mountcastle et al. (1970) suggest that these smaller subunits may also be produced by proteolytic cleavage in vivo, and may account for the accumulation of nucleocapsid in cells persistently infected with paramyxoviruses.",

Glycoprotein peplomers project from the lipid of the envelope. Some of these peplomers are hemagglutinins, in all paramyxoviruses except respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) ; peplomers also have neuraminidase activity in the case of all paramyxoviruses except respiratory syncytial virus and the measles-distemper group. Scheid et al. (1972) , while able to recover two glycoproteins from SV5, found that both hemagglutinating and neuraminidase functions were associated with the larger glycoprotein. Most paramyxoviruses also possess powerful hemolytic and cell fusing potential, but the precise mechanism is still uncertain (review by Poste, 1970) . Hosaka and Shimizu (1972) have performed interesting reconstitution experiments with membrane components extracted from Sendai virions solubilized with NP40. By mixing dialyzed preparations of Sendai virus lipid with isolated peplomers, they were able to produce artificial particles comprised of a membrane with morphologically identifiable peplomers projecting from both sides. Commercial preparations of phosphatidylethanolamine in conjunction with smaller amounts of cholesterol proved a satisfactory substitute for viral lipids. The reconstituted membranes had hemolysin activity, though this was lacking from lipid or peplomers alone. They concluded that the hemolysin characteristic of paramyxoviruses requires the presence of phospholipid (potentiated by cholesterol) to \"activate\" the glycoprotein peplomers.",

It cannot be dissociated into smaller fragments without breaking covalent bonds, and represents the longest known molecule of continuous single-stranded viral RNA. The finding that most virusspecific RNA synthesized in infected cells, including that associated with polyribosomes, hybridizes completely with RNA from virions (Bratt and Robinson, 1967) led to the conclusion that the parental RNA is \"negative\" (anti-message). It was, therefore, not unexpected to find that the virion contained a transcriptase (Huang et ah, 1971; Robinson, 1971a) .

The RNA was resolved into two bands by rate zonal contrifugation (21 and 27 S), while acrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single nucleocapsid protein of molecular weight 25,000 daltons and one or more other proteins in the range 65-75,000 daltons (Pettersson et al,  1971) , the latter being a glycoprotein (Lazdins and Holmes, 1973). By analogy with other viruses, it might be expected that the helical nucleocapsid is enclosed within a protein shell to which a lipid bilayer is closely applied, and from which virus-specified peplomers project; but no relevant investigations have yet been published.",

The peplomers are responsible for the induction of neutralizing antibody to VSV, and constitute the hemagglutinin of rabies virus. After mixed infection of cells, VSV peplomers can be replaced in phenotypically mixed virions (see Chapter 7) by the peplomers of the paramyxovirus SV5, without affecting the overall morphology of the particle (McSharry et al., 1971) . Since the other virion proteins are not affected by protease, except after pretreatment of particles with detergent to remove the lipid, it appears likely that in VSV, as in influenza virus, the lipid is external to the membrane protein \" M \" and the nucleocapsid protein \" N \" (Fig. 3-7) .",

By direct length measurements under the electron microscope, Nakai and Howatson (1968) reached virtually the same answer (3.5 and 1.1 million daltons, respectively). It is now clear that T particles of different sizes may occur, containing RNA with a corresponding variety of lengths. Huang et al. (1970) and Mudd and Summers (1970b) confirmed that the total RNA content of infectious particles was around 3.8 million daltons and demonstrated that it is complementary to messenger RNA obtained from polyribosomes. Such a finding implies the presence of a virion-associated transcriptase, which has been demonstrated (Baltimore et al., 1970) , and shown to transcribe the complete genome into small complementary mRNA molecules in vitro (Bishop and Roy, 1971 ).",

Subgenera C and D, less securely classified in the same genus, comprise, respectively, visna of sheep and the foamy agents of cats, cattle, and primates. The features common to all these viruses are architectural similarity, the possession of a virion-associated RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase), and the presence of a characteristic specific antigen in every member of each of the respective subgenera. All the leukoviruses have a very similar chemical composition and consist of about 60 to 70% protein, 20 to 30% lipid, 2 to 3 % carbohydrate, about 1% RNA, and very small amounts of DNA.

Before describing the morphology of these complex virions it is well to understand Jthe origin and meaning of terms like \"C-type particle\" that are commonly used in current literature. The designations were introduced by Bernhard (1958), after consideration of the morphological appearances seen with the electron microscope in thin sections of mouse mammary adenocarcinomas and mouse leukemia cells. Bernhard's diagram and a modern interpretation of the significance of these particle types is shown in Fig. 3 -8. The essential difference between the morphological development of mouse leukemia virus (and all other viruses of Leukovirus subgenus A) and that of mouse mammary tumor virus (subgenus B) is that in the latter well developed spherical particles (intracytoplasmic A particles) form in the cytoplasm. These viruses (Plate 3-21) then mature by acquiring an envelope as they bud from cytoplasmic membranes to form what are called \"enveloped A particles.\" The B particle, found only with mammary tumor virus, appears to be a degraded \"enveloped A particle,\" in which the envelope has separated from the core. Similar changes occur in other enveloped viruses, e.g., herpes simplex virus.",

The morphological development of members of the other subgenera has not been investigated in much detail. Viruses of subgenus C (e.g., visna virus) resemble the leukemia/sarcoma viruses of subgenus A, i.e., they mature as C-type particles. The foamy viruses of subgenus D, on the other hand, develop as spherical particles in the cytoplasm, rather smaller than the mammary tumor virus (50 nm compared with 75 nm diameter), and then bud to form \"enveloped A particles/7 Structure of Leukovirus; Subgenus A. Analysis of the structure of the leukoviruses has proved extremely difficult. In negatively stained preparations, they are pleomorphic and often \"tailed\" (as in Plate 3-21). This is an artifact because sections and properly fixed preparations (Plate 3-22) reveal that the particles are roughly spherical and about 100 nm in diameter. The lipoprotein envelope contains rather knobby peplomers, that have been identified as being glycoproteins (Rifkin and Compans, 1971 uranyl acetate, revealed clearly that the peplomers were globular structures about 8 nm in diameter that projected from a membrane (probably lipoprotein) about 8 nm thick (Fig. 3-9 ) (Nermut et ah, 1972) .",

The polypeptides of several leukoviruses have been examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, by gel filtration in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, and by their antigenic properties (review, Nowinski et al., 1972) . Although there are minor disagreements between different laboratories concerning the exact number of polypeptide chains and their locations within the particles, in general, the picture is satisfyingly cohesive. However, the whole subject is currently made unnecessarily difficult because of the failure to agree on a system of nomenclature for the polypeptides and antigens. Tables 3-9 and 3-10 show a comparison of the nomenclature and results obtained by different groups, with the avian and murine leukoviruses of subgenus A. The protein corresponding to gs2 appears as a shoulder on RSV3. 0 Proteins corresponding to gs3 and p5 appear superimposed in PAGE (Fleissner, 1971). The strong gs antigen reported at this mobility must thus be gs3. d Protein G contains carbohydrate and has a molecular weight (ca. 115,000) compatible with a complex of mi and m 2/ neither of which appear as distinct monomers in this system. e Identified by molecular weight, gs antigenicity, and amino acid composition. 1 Protein 1 contains carbohydrate and may represent an aggregate of protein 3 ( = m l ) , since ml aggregates strongly even in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (Fleissner, 1971) . For additional evidence that the smaller glycoprotein forms residual aggregates in SDS during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, see The purified virions of all leukoviruses contain seven or eight polypeptides. Two of these are glycoproteins, which are located as peplomers in the viral envelope (Rifkin and Compans, 1971) , and carry a strain-specific antigenic activity which can be identified by neutralization tests, immunofluorescence of infected living cells, and viral interference. The nucleoid contains several polypeptides which carry group-specific antigenic activity, identified by immunodiffusion, complement fixation, and immunofluorescence of fixed cells. The group-specific antigenic activity is distributed among several of the polypeptides of the nucleoid and falls into two classes: (a) an activity that is specific to all leukoviruses isolated from one animal species, and (b) an activity which is common to viruses isolated from different species. All RNA tumor viruses carry groupspecific (gs) antigens, but only the mammalian leukemia/sarcoma viruses possess an \"interspecies\" antigen. As can be seen from Tables 3-9 and 3-10, there is still a confusing nomenclature for the assignment of antigenic activities to individual polypeptides.",

Several of these enzymes are located on the virion envelope, e.g., ATPase, but many of them are associated with the nucleoid so that it is necessary to disrupt the virion envelope with neutral detergent in order to demonstrate them. There is no evidence that bears on whether these particle-associated enzymes are host-or virus-coded, but there seems little doubt that many of them are adsorbed onto viral nucleoids or en-velopes during maturation or are present in vesicles which copurify with the virions. Although direct evidence is still lacking, it seems likely that at least some of the virion-associated enzymes play a role in transformation and viral growth. For instance, it is tempting to believe that the function of the RNAdependent DNA polymerase is to synthesize proviral DNA and that the virionassociated ligase and the nucleases act together to integrate the proviral DNA into the host genome (see Chapter 14).",

They can be charged with amino acids (Travnicek, 1968) , they hybridize to cellular DNA, and the hybridization is competed by cellular transfer RNA's (Baluda and Nayak, 1970) . These experiments show that the RNA tumor viruses contain transfer RNA derived from host cells, presumably during viral maturation. The incorporation of transfer RNA's into virions seems to be selective because different species of transfer RNA's are not present in the same ratios in the virus particles as in the host cells (Travnicek, 1968; Erikson and Erikson, 1970; J. M. Taylor et al., unpublished) . Some of the 4 S RNA in the virus particles is attached to the 60-70 S RNA by hydrogen bonds (Erikson and Erikson, 1971 ) and recent evidence suggests that its function may be to act as primer during DNA synthesis from the viral RNA template (J.

The capsomers of the outer shell have not yet been visualized clearly enough to determine their spatial arrangement. Two interpretations have been suggested: (a) that there are 92 hollow prismatic capsomers arranged on the surface of an icosahedron (Mayor et al., 1965) , or (b) that there are 180 solid capsomers positioned equidistantly from the center of the virion and arranged around 92 holes (Vasquez and Tournier, 1964; Amano et al., 1971) . Both these models require that the number of capsomers visible around the circumference of the particle (peripheral capsomers) should be a multiple of 6. However, careful measurements by Luftig et al. (1972) reveal that there are 20 peripheral capsomers, leading to a calculated total number of capsomers of about 120.

Chymotrypsin first removes \u03c3 3 completely, leaving the virions fully infectious; then \u03bc2 is degraded by stagewise cleavage and this is accompanied by a precipitous drop in infectivity, loss of the virion-associated oligonucleotides, and \"activation\" of the virion transcriptase; the minor protein, \u03c3\u03b9, is lost last, on fivefold vertices.

Because of the small number of capsomers the triangulation number of the capsid is difficult to determine by observing the relationship between neighboring pentamers. Both Els and Verwoerd (1969) and Murphy et al. (1971a) believe the capsid to be icosahedral with 32 capsomers (T = 3). The capsomers are large (8-11 nm diameter), rather widely placed, and have a hollow cylindrical (doughnut) shape. Different members of the genus differ somewhat in size (65-80 nm in diameter, according to Murphy et al., 1971a) but most are smaller than reoviruses (Plate 3-24).

            "text": "Electron microscopic examination shows that HB-Ag consists of spheres and tubules 20 nm in diameter and comprised of subunits resembling capsomers (Plate 3-25). Chemically, most investigators believe that HB-Ag is devoid of nucleic acid, although Jozwiak et ah, (1971) have reported that it consists of 70% protein, 25% lipid, and 5% RNA. The immunogenicity of HB-Ag is damaged by some proteases, especially after prior treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate or diethyl ether, suggesting that it is a lipoprotein. The major lipid components are cholesterol, lecithin, and sphingomyelin, but the antigenic determinants reside in the protein moiety (Kim and Bissell, 1971). Acrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals two major polypeptides, with molecular weights of 26,000 and 32,000 daltons, and a minor polypeptide of molecular weight 40,000 daltons (Gerin etal, 1971) .HB-Ag is antigenically complex. All preparations share a common antigenic determinant, a; three minor determinants, d, x, and y (Le Bouvier, 1971) are distributed differently in different HB-Ag positive sera, which can be divided into three subgroups according to their possession of d, y, or neither.Samples of blood or serum containing HB-Ag are usually infectious for man, but the 20 nm particles of antigen are not the virions. In some sera, the 20 nm HB-Ag particles are accompanied by larger spherical particles with a diameter of 42 nm (Dane et al., 1970; Plate 3-25) , which appear to have a double shell. Study by immunoelectron microscopy of a serum sample that contained predominantly this larger particle (Almeida et al., 1971 ) and examination of sections (Huang, 1971 ) and homogenates of livers of acute hepatitis (Almeida et al., 1970) , led to a tentative picture of the structure and morphogenesis of the virion (Almeida et al., 1971) . The 42 nm particles can be disrupted by detergent treatment to release 27 nm spherical particles that are identical with the spherical particles found in the nuclei of liver cells (Plate 3-25) and in liver homogenates. When the disrupted particles, or the material obtained from liver homogenates, was treated with posthepatitis sera that contained no anti-HB-Ag the 27 nm particle specifically attached antibody molecules, visualized by electron microscopy. Some sera that contained anti-HB-Ag, on the other hand, agglutinated HB-Ag particles and tubules but did not attach to the 27 nm spheres. Tentatively, it is suggested that the virions are spherical particles with a diameter of 42 nm that consist of two protein shells. The inner one is assembled in the nucleus; the outer capsid is added later. The outer capsid consists of capsomers of a different antigenic specificity, which are made in excess, and often aggregate to form small HB-Ag particles.Preliminary claims have been made that morphologically similar but serologically distinct particles may be found in fecal extracts but not serum from cases of infectious hepatitis (Cross et al., 1971) .",

            "text": "This murine virus, originally and more correctly termed lactic dehydrogenaseelevating virus, has a distinctive morphology not matched by any other known virus (de-Th\u00e9 and Notkins, 1965) . In negatively stained preparations, most particles are elliptical in shape, 60-65 nm wide and 70-85 nm long; they appear somewhat smaller in sections. LDV appears to replicate exclusively in macrophages, sections of which reveal both oval and circular profiles. The latter show a core 26-29 nm in diameter, surrounded by several shells or layers, an inner dense shell 7-9 nm wide, and an outer layer of low density 5-7 nm wide limited by a thin outer membrane.Extraction with phenol releases infectious RNA (Notkins, 1965 ), which appears to consist of a single molecule of single-stranded RNA with a molecular weight of about 5 million daltons (Darnell and Plagemann, 1972) . Agents that share the characteristics of scrapie virus (reviews, Gibbs and Gajdusek, 1971; Hunter, 1972 ) are known to cause four diseases, scrapie of sheep, mink encephalopathy, and kuru and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease in man (see Chapter 12). These \"viruses\" are nonimmunogenic, and can be distinguished from each other only by their pathological behavior (see Table 12 -4). Reliable experiments reveal that the infectivity of scrapie is filterable. As assayed by infectivity, the scrapie agent passes through membranes of 43 but not 27 nm average pore diameter. High resistance to ionizing and ultraviolet irradiation (Alper et al., 1966; Haig et al., 1969) suggest that the nucleic acid has a very small target area, equivalent to 2 X 10 5 daltons, which is hardly enough to code for one small protein. Infectivity is highly resistant to heating, formalin, proteases, and nucleases but susceptible to ether, periodate, urea, and phenol (Table 3-12) . However, it should be remembered that all these tests have been carried out with impure preparations, and heat resistance, for instance, is greatly reduced after fluorocarbon treatment. There seems to be a close association between the infectivity and cellular membrane fragments (Lampert et al.,  1971b; Kimberton et al., 1971) .",

One advantage of a valid system of viral classification is that the findings should, in general, apply reasonably well to other species within these taxa.Basic features of the structure of animal viruses have already been presented in Chapter 1 (Tables 1-1 and 1-8, and Fig. 1-3) . Here we shall set out, largely in tabular form, some general aspects of their chemical composition and add to the generalizations already given in Chapter 1.",

            "text": "Present evidence suggests strongly that the majority of polypeptides associated with purified virions are virus-specified. Two kinds of exceptions are worth noting: (a) chance inclusion of minor proteins associated with cellular membranes in the envelopes of some enveloped viruses, e.g., ATPase in avian myeloblastosis virus particles grown in myeloblasts, but not in virions grown in cells that lack ATPase in their membranes (de-Th\u00e9 et al., 1963) ; (b) cellular proteins that may be included in the cores of some icosahedral viruses, e.g., the basic proteins of the polyomaviruses.Proteins in the virion are of four main kinds, capsid, core, envelope, and enzymatic (Tables 3-13 and 3 -14) . In most isometric viruses, several polypeptide molecules (of one or more kinds) combine to form the basic morphological units (capsomers) of the capsid, whereas the capsomers of all tubular nucleocapsids are monomers of a single polypeptide species. It is clear that the term \"core\" is employed rather too all embracingly, to mean different things by different workers. The core of reo virions is more correctly described as an inner capsid since it shows typical icosahedral symmetry; herpes virions have several concentric capsids. The \"core\" of adenovirions appears to consist of histonelike proteins bound intimately to the DNA. That of the poxviruses is probably extremely complex and it is likely that further research will reveal that its seventeen polypeptides are distributed in several layers.RNA animal viruses with tubular nucleocapsids have envelopes that contain two kinds of proteins, an inner nonglycosylated membrane or matrix protein, and projecting peplomers which are always glycoproteins.

Some Polyomavirus \"pseudovirions\" contain only host DNA, and in the same genus other virions carry sequences of host DNA covalently bonded to viral DNA. The complex virions of leukoviruses always include some low molecular weight cellular RNA's and often considerable quantities of cellular DNA, while arenaviruses regularly contain cellular ribosomes.Viral nucleic acid takes many forms. In DNA viruses, the genome usually consists of a single molecule, linear or cyclic, which may contain single-stranded breaks (Table 3 -16). The parvoviruses, however, contain single-stranded DNA and separate virions encapsidate + or -strands. Parvovirus DNA carries so few genes (about 3) that some members of the genus are defective, whereas the largest DNA viruses (poxviruses) carry well over 100 genes (see Chapter 7). The RNA animal viruses present a very diverse picture in the nature of their RNA and in the ways in which the viral genetic information is eventually translated into polypeptides (Table 3- ",
