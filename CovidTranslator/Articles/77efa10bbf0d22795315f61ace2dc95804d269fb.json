From the perspective of the route of transmission of COVID-19, mainly for the close contact and the spread of respiratory tract, the infectious, many for family gathering, patients not only concerned about their illness, more concerned about the infection of members of the family; 2. From the perspective of COVID-19, the new virus had never found in the human body, because of Wuhan viral pneumonia cases were found in 2019, was named the world health organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020, so the people the knowledge of the new disease, less about the characteristics of the virus and disease diagnosis, treatment and prognosis are exploring, so the uncertainty is adding to the patients with tension and fear of disease; 3. In a short period of time, a large number of COVID-19 patients broke out, the news media continuously reported, the death of some patients, all make the patients' psychological bearing capacity is low, in the course of illness is prone to depression, or even negative ideas. Therefore, in the process of disease treatment, patients not only need medical treatment, but also need psychological support. It is worth noting that in the process of receiving the intervention, a small number of patients began to reject the psychological intervention and deny the psychological problems. After our patient and careful explanation and communication, they finally accepted our help, which also reflected that our medical staff needed to take the initiative to publicize and provide help to more patients.",
