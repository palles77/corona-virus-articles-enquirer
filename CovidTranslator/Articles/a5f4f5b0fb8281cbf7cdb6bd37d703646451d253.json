            "text": "For these and other reasons, disaster epidemiology has historically been somewhat marginalized from the broader discipline of epidemiology. However, the role of epidemiologists in responding to disasters has expanded dramatically in the last two decades. Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) methods, adapted from the World Health Organization's Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) method of estimating immunization coverage, began to be implemented regularly after humanitarian emergencies, beginning with the famines in Somalia (Boss, Toole, & Yip, 1994) , and after disasters, beginning with Hurricane Andrew (CDC, 1992; Hlady et al., 1994; Malilay, Flanders, & Brogan, 1996) . Emergency department surveillance systems were implemented to capture illness, injury, and mortality data to quantify the health impacts of disasters such as floods in Louisiana (Ogden, Gibbs-Scharf, Kohn, & Malilay, 2001) and Hurricane Floyd in North Carolina (CDC, 2000) . Other types of epidemiologic investigations, such as retrospective and prospective cohort studies, began to be implemented to study the long-term effects of disasters such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (Savitz et al., 2008 , the Indian Ocean Tsunami (Nishikiori et al., 2006) , and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (Stewart et al., 2011) . The systematic use of the term \"disaster epidemiology\" since the 1990s has helped to establish the discipline as a formal subset of epidemiology and encourage its ongoing development (Malilay et al., 2014) .",

Globally, the number of people at risk continues to grow along with the populations of megacities located in vulnerable coastal areas, as does the cost of disasters relative to real global GDP (Bouwer, Crompton, Faust, H\u00f6ppe, & Pielke, 2007) .

Since data on immunization coverage and the burden of vaccinepreventable diseases (e.g., tetanus, diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, and polio) were not available, cluster sampling methods were utilized to collect rapid data on vaccination coverage. The data gathered from these initial assessments helped to identify gaps in vaccination coverage and provide data to support the implementation of new programs to address them (Table 1 .1).",

Systems that did exist focused on 1960se1980s communicable diseases such as malaria, influenza, yellow fever, dengue, tuberculosis, and cholera; however, little microbiological laboratory capacity was available to support these surveillance programs (Raska, 1966) . Even in low resource settings, the need for postdisaster epidemiologic surveillance was made clear after a major earthquake killed 23,000 and injured 77,000 in Guatemala in February, 1976. The Ministry of Health's surveillance network was severely affected by the destruction of health facilities and the loss of communication and transportation infrastructure (Spencer et al., 1977) . The lack of public health surveillance data was having a major impact on decisions related to opening field hospitals, conducting vaccination campaigns, and controlling rumors of epidemics (Spencer et al., 1977) . Even with limited capacity, a surveillance system was established to collect data on cases of selected diseases, the number of available hospital beds, the availability of medications, and potential outbreaks. Following a major winter storm that impacted the Northeastern United States in February, 1978, surveillance of emergency rooms and town clerks was established to track morbidity and mortality related to the storm (Glass et al., 1979 ). The surveillance system allowed public health officials to provide evidence that disease outbreaks and environmental contamination events were not occurring, and therefore quell widely circulating rumors.",

Some epidemiologic studies were also implemented to address the potential long-term impacts of disasters on health. For example, five years after a major flooding disaster associated with Hurricane Agnes (Fig. 1.1) , factors such as property loss, financial difficulties, use of alcohol, and perceived distress during the recovery period were associated with continued high blood pressure, somatization, and anxiety among residents of an affected town in Pennsylvania (Logue, Hansen, and Hansen 1980) .

In addition to postdisaster questionnaires, Bertazzi suggested that follow-up studies should be implemented to better understand longer-term health impacts and that these studies should include the collection and maintenance of biological samples to evaluate the initial extent of exposure as well as changes over time. For example, multiple follow-up studies were conducted by the Bhopal Gas Disaster Research Center and the Indian Council for Medical Research following exposure to methyl isocyanate gas that leaked from a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984, to enable tracking of long-term mortality and morbidity (Dhara & Dhara, 2002) . Multiple cohorts, including cleanup workers and children born to mothers exposed to radiation from the 1986 meltdown of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, continue to be followed to monitor for health outcomes such as suicide and cancers (Ivanov et al., 2012; Rahu, Rahu, Tekkel, & Bromet, 2006) .",

At the same time, increased media attention to disaster relief efforts, as well as the growth of global communication networks put more pressure on disaster response agencies to identify potential public health issues sooner and rapidly implement interventions to mitigate the health consequences of disasters in affected communities. Even with advancing computing technologies, rapid 1990s assessments were still frequently conducted using nonprobability sampling methods. The level of resources required to conduct RNAs remained relatively high, typically requiring outside assistance from various experts to develop assessment instruments, conduct interviews, and analyze data. However, during the 1990s, advancesdled by WHO and CDCdwere made to demonstrate the use of modified cluster sampling to perform RNAs (Hlady et al., 1994; Malilay et al., 1996; Turner, Magnani, & Shuaib, 1996; WHO, 1999) . These advances, as well as the regular use of portable computers to collect and analyze data on-site and immediately postdisaster meant that data-driven disaster relief activities could begin more quickly than traditional methods would have allowed (Lillibridge et al., 1993) .",

Several reports published in the 1990s demonstrated the effective use of surveillance data in disaster management, when it is vital to fully understand the impact of a disaster on a population's health. For example, following the Rwandan genocide of 1994, mortality and morbidity surveillance systems were established to track the health impacts among Rwandan refugees settled in Zaire (Goma Epidemiology Group, 1995) . Ongoing morbidity surveillance was used to observe patterns in disease, assess needs, and effectively implement interventions. For example, the system was used to track cases of diarrheal disease, such as cholera and dysentery, which tended to be highly prevalent among these large refugee populations and could be easily transmissible in small areas. After the 1991e92 famine in Somalia, reviews of data from multiple assessments led researchers to call for the establishment of a surveillance system to track mortality, morbidity, and nutritional status so that data could be used to develop interventions programs and policies (Boss et al., 1994) . The standardization of surveillance systems and the sharing of the data collected made it possible for other response groups to utilize similar approaches in other disaster settings.",

Other researchers modified the cluster sampling approach to conduct national surveys to measure multiple objectives (Turner et al., 1996) . In addition, cross-sectional or prevalence studies were also beginning to be used in disaster epidemiology investigations due to their relative efficiency and costeffectiveness. For example, Chen et al., (2015) conducted face-to-face interviews with victims of the 1998 Hunan, China floods who had been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to better understand risk factors for chronic PTSD.

Since an outside team traveling to reach a disaster-effected area to conduct an RNA can sometimes take more than a week and developing protocols to support the implementation of the assessment can take additional time, disaster-effected and displaced populations may be waiting too long to gain maximum benefit from the assessment findings. For example, during the first several weeks after a disaster, the risk factors and conditions that support the transmission of communicable diseases may begin to increase (Asari, Koido, Nakamura, Yamamoto, & Ohta, 2000) . One way of shortening the length of time it takes to begin an assessment is to use geographical informational system (GIS) tools to speed up the processes of sample selection (Waring, Reynolds, D'Souza, & Arafat, 2002) . Handheld devices such as tablets, smart phones, and global positioning system devices can be used to collect data electronically, reducing the time needed for data collection (CDC, 2004) . Electronic data collection also eliminates double data entry, which can be an important consideration when dealing with the time constraints inherent in conducting assessments during public health emergencies (Horney, Ramsey, Smith, Johnson, & MacDonald, 2011) .",

Standardized assessment tools that could be used to eliminate inconsistencies that can arise when disaster managers adopt different protocols to conduct assessments at different times and locations and in response to different types of disasters were developed. For example, after Hurricane Katrina, numerous agencies and organizations conducted needs assessments of evacuees. Among evacuees relocated to West Virginia after Hurricane Katrina, individual-level data were collected via a rapid assessment developed by the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources and CDC. Rapid assessment data were then linked with Red Cross household registration records by name and age to ensure the rapid procurement of services needed to meet the immediate needs of evacuees (Ridenour, Cummings, Sinclair, & Bixler, 2007) .",
