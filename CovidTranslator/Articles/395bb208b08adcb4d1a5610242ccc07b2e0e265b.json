            "text": "Although most cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occur in smokers, only a fraction of smokers develop the disease. We hypothesized distinct molecular signatures for COPD and emphysema in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of current and former smokers. To test this hypothesis, we identified and validated PBMC gene expression profiles in smokers with and without COPD. We generated expression data on 136 subjects from the COPDGene study, using Affymetrix U133 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Multiple linear regression with adjustment for covariates (gender, age, body mass index, family history, smoking status, and pack-years) was used to identify candidate genes, and ingenuity pathway analysis was used to identify candidate pathways. Candidate genes were validated in 149 subjects according to multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, which included 75 subjects not previously profiled. Pathways that were differentially expressed in subjects with COPD and emphysema included those that play a role in the immune system, inflammatory responses, and sphingolipid (ceramide) metabolism. Twenty-six of the 46 candidate genes (e.g., FOXP1, TCF7, and ASAH1) were validated in the independent cohort. Plasma metabolomics was used to identify a novel glycoceramide (galabiosylceramide) as a biomarker of emphysema, supporting the genomic association between acid ceramidase (ASAH1) and emphysema. COPD is a systemic disease whose gene expression signatures in PBMCs could serve as novel diagnostic or therapeutic targets.",

Although cigarette smoking is the major environmental risk factor and is present in greater than 80% of patients with COPD (2) , only approximately 20% of smokers develop COPD. Previous studies have shown that there are heritable risk factors (3, 4) , but the relationship between genetic risk and the molecular changes associated with COPD remains unknown. Although the traditional definition of COPD is based on spirometry measurements, recent work suggests that distinct COPD subtypes are independent of spirometry, such as those with emphysema predominance (5) , chronic bronchitis (6) , or frequent exacerbations (7) . The molecular mechanisms for these phenotypes remain largely unknown, but several studies using small panels of selected biomarkers suggest that inflammation plays a role in distinguishing phenotypes (8, 9) .",

As an alternative, we propose the use of peripheral blood to study gene expression profiles in smokers with and without COPD because of its noninvasive availability and ease of use for biomarker screening. The utility of peripheral blood gene expression profiling for the identification of molecular signatures has been demonstrated in a wide range of diseases and disorders, including cancers and neurologic disease (19) . Furthermore, studies of COPD have found overlapping gene expression signatures between blood and lung tissue (20) or alveolar macrophages (21) . However, those recent COPD studies of blood involved small sample sizes (n \u00bc 24-38) (20, 21) and therefore low statistical power to observe real differences, or they primarily examined subjects with less severe COPD (22) . To overcome these limitations, we describe an investigation, which to our knowledge is the largest to use gene expression profiling (n \u00bc 211) in blood, with a comprehensive representation of COPD severity.",

Subjects were initially divided into either a hypothesis (n \u00bc 136) or a replication/testing (n \u00bc 75) group. The hypothesis group was designed to represent a COPD cohort with a broad range of airflow obstruction, and was balanced with respect to demographic and clinical covariates (Table 1) . To validate our top findings using an independent platform (as will be discussed), 74 subjects in the hypothesis group were randomly selected as a confirmation group, in addition to the 75 independent replication subjects (see Figure E1 and Table E1 in the online supplement).",

ASAH1 has been associated with the lysosomal storage disorder Farber disease (39) . ASAH1 is highly expressed in the thyroid, lymphocytes, and lung (according to the Gene Atlas) (40) . The knockdown of rat alveolar macrophage ASAH1 improves the cigarette smokeinduced inhibition of apoptosis (41) . In a recent whole-blood microarray study using 67 training and 65 test subjects, ASAH1 whole-blood expression was the top candidate biomarker for distinguishing subjects with and without airflow obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC , 0.7 versus FEV 1 /FVC > 0.7, respectively) (22) . In our study, ASAH1 expression in PBMCs was higher in subjects with severe COPD and emphysema in both the training and test cohorts. As further evidence of this pathway's importance in emphysema and COPD, our metabolomic investigations identified a glycoceramide (galabiosylceramide) as a biomarker of emphysema. Interestingly, an abnormal accumulation of galabiosylceramide occurs in Fabry syndrome (angiokeratoma corporis diffusum), and patients with Fabry syndrome are prone to manifest COPD (42) and emphysema (43) . Ceramides are bioactive lipids that mediate cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration, and ceramidases such as acid ceramidase (ASAH1) catalyze the hydrolysis of ceramides into sphingosine (44) . Thus, acid ceramides play a role in metabolizing ceramides such as galabiosyceramide. We believe that this is the first report identifying galabiosylceramide as a biomarker of COPD. However, additional work will be needed to understand more about the role of the glycoceramides in the pathogenesis of emphysema.",

            "text": "The major limitation of this study is its cross-sectional basis. This limitation may be assumed to be of minor importance, because the biologic variability of microarray gene expression is very low over short time periods (1 wk), suggesting the stability of the gene expression phenotype (52) . However, the stability of PBMC gene expression over longer time periods is unknown, and we do not know whether these gene expression profiles are predictive of declines in lung function or the progression of emphysema. Furthermore, in the parent COPDGene study (23) , smokers with normal spirometry were defined as control subjects. Based on these control subjects, we are not able to assess the effects of smoking alone in PBMC expression. Others reported that gene expression is associated with smoking in the oxidative stress response, antiapoptosis and cell-death signaling, and carcinogen metabolism (53) (54) (55) . However, we found that in our final candidate genes, the correlation of smoking variables with expression was either nonexistent or relatively small compared with the effects of other covariates. Several studies profiled lung tissue in COPD and emphysema subjects. We did not find a significant overlap in the PBMC genes identified in the present work and in those previous studies (data not shown). These results do not suggest a common signature between PBMCs and lung tissue, but the comparisons are also based on small sample sizes (n < 30), which compromises their statistical power. Future work in larger studies or in paired analyses with blood and lung tissue from the same subjects will be able to provide more definitive conclusions. Finally, because of cost and statistical power, the expression profiling was restricted to one racial and ethnic group (non-Hispanic whites). Although this is was a large study with an independent replication cohort, additional gene expression studies in never-smokers and in other ethnicities and races, and different clinical or research studies, would improve the generalizability of our findings. Despite these limitations, by using COPDGene, we were able to leverage a large, well-phenotyped cohort of subjects with COPD. The candidate genes identified in this study suggest new disease targets and further mechanistic studies that can be designed to identify which candidate genes might be important causes of COPD.",
