Feed ingestions, weight gains, slaughter (SW) and carcass weights (CW), carcass conformation and fat scores, and meat characteristics (24 hours postmortem): colour, pH, water holding capacity, chemical composition and texture (Warner Bratzler (WB) test, sensory panel), were studied. NW calves showed the highest SW and CW (P b 0.001). Yellowness (b*), redness (a*) and chroma (C*) were higher in NW than W2 calves (P b 0.05). Shear firmness was higher in W2 than in NW and W5 veal. W2 veal was less elastic (P b 0.05), tender (P b 0.05) and juicy (P b 0.01) than NW and W5 veal.",

Recognition of the unique quality of Galician beef prompted the European Union (EU) to accept, in 1996, the Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) of Galician Veal \"Ternera Gallega\", which comprises pure RG and its crosses (CEE, 1996) . The PGI \"Ternera Gallega\" classifies the animals as calves (98%) and yearling bulls (2%) depending on whether slaughter was earlier or later than ten months of age, respectively. Two classes of veal are commercialized, the \"Normal\" class calves (40%) suckle their mothers for at least two months and are weaned before being slaughtered, and the \"Suprema\" class calves (60%) suckle their mothers throughout their life (Ternera, Gallega, 2008) .",

Moreover, the PGI \"Ternera Gallega\" is of major importance in Spain regarding the commercialization of high quality meat, 48% is marketed in Galicia, 50% in other areas of Spain and 2% exported (Ternera, Gallega, 2008) . Owing to the importance of \"Ternera Gallega\", the objectives of this study were to determine the effect of weaning status on animal performance, carcass quality and physical characteristics of the Longissimus thoracis (LT) from RG calves and establish that meat from non-weaned compared to weaned calves, justifies the higher prices of \"Suprema\" class meat. Variations of \"Normal\" class veal, induced by the artificial lactation system with early weaning were also studied.",

Every steak was then trimmed of external connective tissue, cut into 2 cm 3 samples, wrapped in codified aluminium paper and stored warm until analysis. To avoid the effect of order presentation and first-order and carryover effects, the samples were presented to panellists in different orders (Macfie, Bratchell, Greenhoff, & Vallis, 1989) . The sensory analysis was performed in individual cabins fitted with red light (ISO 8589, 1988) . The panel included eight selected and trained panellists (ISO 8586-1, 1993) . The test used a quantitative descriptive method within a complete and balanced design that included 12 plates containing three samples, one of each treatment on each plate. Testing was in four sessions with three plates per session. On a ten point scale, panellists assessed four attributes of the texture profile: tenderness (defined as the opposite of the force required to bite through the sample with the molars), juiciness (amount of moisture released by the sample after the first two chews), chewiness (number of chews needed to swallow the sample) and elasticity (capacity of recuperation of the sample initial shape after being deformed between the molars without being broken). A score of 1 stood for tough, dry, not chewy and firm and 10 stood for tender, juicy, chewy and elastic.",

These results could be due to compensatory growth (O'Donovan, 1984; Ryan, Williams, & Moir, 1993) after an under nutrition period because of the adaptation of the W2 calves to suckle from a bucket instead of their mothers. Moreover, since W2 calves started having solid food earlier, their rumen development could have happened sooner (Baldwin, McLeod, Klotz, & Heitmann, 2004; Tamate, McGilliard, Jacobson, & Getty, 1962) than in NW and W5 calves, which favours a higher intake capacity. W5 calves showed the lowest ADG values (Table 1) ; however, after being weaned, these animals ingested higher amounts of feed (CI) than the NW group. The extra concentrate ingested by W5 calves was not enough to compensate the energy supplied by dam's milk in the NW group over the same period.",

Many studies consider that nutrition has no major influence on meat ultimate pH (Crouse, Cross, & Seideman, 1984; Dufrasne, Hornick, Gauthier, Korsak, & Istasse, 1995; Hornick, Clinquart, Gauthier, van Eenaeme, & Istasse, 1995; Hornick et al., 1998) , however other authors (Albert\u00ed, & Sa\u00f1udo, 1987; Albert\u00ed, Sa\u00f1udo, Lahoz, Jaime, & Tena, 1988; Sierra, Sa\u00f1udo, Olleta, & Forcada, 1988) found higher pH values in meat from animals finished on concentrate for long periods. In NW and W5 animals, the finishing period with concentrate was three months shorter than in W2 group (Table 1) , this could account for the higher LT pH in W2 meat. It is important to note that the pH values were below 5.8, in the normal range for beef (Garrido, & Ba\u00f1\u00f3n, 2001; Renerre, 1996) . When the pH is over this value the meat is unattractive (Monserrat, S\u00e1nchez, Fern\u00e1ndez, Viana, & De La Calle, 1997) , termed DFD (dry, firm and dark) (Garrido, & Ba\u00f1\u00f3n, 2001) and is less acceptable to consumers than normal pH meat (Viljoen, Kock, & Webb, 2002) . Other authors have reported that weaning status had no influence on the pH of ruminants' muscles (Blanco et al., 2009; Oliete et al., 2006; Velasco, Ca\u00f1eque, Lauzurica, P\u00e9rez, & Huidobro, 2004) .",

Further milk supplementation in a concentrate diet had no effect on the water holding capacity of beef from Belgian Blue bulls (Hornick et al., 1996) ; however, the drip losses were higher and cooking loss lower than in the present study, probably due to a longer ageing period.
