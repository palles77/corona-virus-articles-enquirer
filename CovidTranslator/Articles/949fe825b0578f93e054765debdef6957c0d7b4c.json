            "text": "Abstract Accumulating studies have shown that bats could harbor various important pathogenic viruses that could be transmitted to humans and other animals. Extensive metagenomic studies of different organs/tissues from bats have revealed a large number of novel or divergent viruses. To elucidate viral diversity and epidemiological and phylogenetic characteristics, six pooled fecal samples from bats were generated (based on bat species and geographic regions characteristic for virome analysis). These contained 500 fecal samples from six bat species, collected Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening with consensus primers, closely related viral species in bats have been detected [2] [3] [4] . However, the high assay specificity of these methods has limited the detection of divergent or unknown viruses. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has facilitated metagenomic analyses to simultaneously screen for all viral families. NGS has been successfully applied to detect novel viruses in different types of samples (including lungs, liver, brain, pharyngeal swabs and anal swabs) [7] and is expected to provide more in-depth information on previously unidentified viruses and viral taxonomy. Studies from the US [8, 9] , France [10] , New Zealand [11] and China [12] [13] [14] [15] have analyzed the virome profiles of bats with NGS technology and have identified various unknown mammalian viruses. Most of these studies analyzed viral contigs by homogenizing different organs and tissues of bats; however, this approach is restricted by the unclear tissue distribution and route of transmission of bat viruses. The paucity of knowledge on bat-derived viruses warrants more extensive investigation and surveillance of different bat species in various geographic areas. The digestive tract is connected to the outer environment through ingestion of foods and liquids, providing a niche for virus transmission from bats to humans and other animals. Investigation of the virome in fecal samples from bats, and subsequent epidemiological and phylogenetic characterization, of any viruses, would significantly advance our understanding, especially with regards to prevention and management of zoonotic diseases in different geographic regions.",

            "text": "Similarly to previous studies [5] [6] [7] [8] , a considerable number of viral sequence reads could be classified into virus families: plant, fungal, bacterial, insect, archaeal and algal in nature. The identification of insect viruses, fungal viruses and plant viruses presumably corresponds to the habits and habitats of the bats, including insect-eating, cave-dwelling and social stucture. In addition, the identification of phages likely reflects the bacterial flora harbored inside the bats. Since we focused on the putative role of bats in zoonotic disease transmission, only mammalian virus contigs were analyzed further. Similarly to previous studies, most mammalian viruses were typical zoonotic viruses, including viruses classifiable as Influenza virus A, as well as members of the genera Mastadenovirus, Rotavirus, Mamastrovirus, Coronavirus, Hantavirus, Rhabdovirus and Parechovirus, and also members of the family Papillomaviridae. Metagenomic analyses in other studies have identified the full-length sequences of adenoviruses [8, 10, 12, 14] , papillomaviruses [13, 14, 27, 28] , parvoviruses [8, 13, 29] , circoviruses [29] , herpesviruses [11] and rotaviruses [12] . However, it is challenging to make specific or direct comparisons with our study due to significant methodological variations; for instance, the sample type (e.g., fresh guano, urine and roost guano), virus enrichment procedures (e.g., nuclease treatment, centrifugation and filtration) and amplification methods and/or high-throughput sequencing platforms [30] . The most important finding of our study was that the influenza A virus and coronavirus sequences we identified in bats shared their highest genetic identity with previous isolates from humans, suggesting possible cross-species transmission. However, contig sequences representing viruses classifiable Similar to the findings of Yuan et al [15] , retroviruses were one of the most commonly found viruses in bats. Rousettus leschenaultii from Hainan was found to harbor phylogenetically distant gammaretroviruses from those found in Myotis lucifugus, Megaderma lyra, Myotis davidii and Myotis ricketti, which suggested that bats might be suitable vectors for retrovirus transmission [31, 32] . Interestingly, we found that the AdV contigs from HN.RL (representing the IVa2 genes) were clustered with human adenovirus-C and shared higher amino acid sequence identity with human adenoviruses than previously reported bat AdVs. This might indicate the possible evolution of novel viral strains. Owing to the limited size and number of contigs generated by Illumina sequencing, conventional PCR assays are warranted to generate longer and more abundant sequences for further phylogenetic analysis [33, 34] .",

According to recent classification criteria: 1) PVs belong to different PV genera when they share less then 60% nucleotide sequence identity across the entire L1 ORF [28] ; 2) the taxonomic status of PV types, subtypes and variants is based on the conventional criteria that the sequence of their L1 genes should be at least 10%, 2-10% and maximally 2% dissimilar from one another. Because the bat L1 sequences shared a maximum of 58.9% nucleotide identity with the L1 sequence of HPVs-92, these PVs cannot be placed in one of the existing genera. The bat PVs therefore represent tentative members of a novel, yet innominated, PV genus. Our findings argue against the mainstream theory that PVs are highly species specific and co-evolve with their host. Compatible with the results of Garcia-Perezstrict et al [35] , this hypothesis of virus-host co-evolution is rejected by the existence of 11 closely related bat PVs in Scotophilus kuhlii and Rhinolophus blythi and by the lack of congruence between bats and bat PV phylogenies. Second, the possible inter-transmission of PVs to infect two different bat species (Scotophilus kuhlii and Rhinolophus blythi) argues against strict host specificity. However, the L1 sequence detected herein was only 450 bp in length, which does not represent the whole of the L1 gene. Further studies with additional genomic sequences are required to examine the potential pathogenic role of PVs in other bat species, which would provide insights into the ecology and evolution of PVs in bats. These findings might help address whether the prevailing paradigms regarding PV evolution should be reconsidered.",

Two distinct simian RVA strains (RRV and TUCH) have multiple genotypes more typical of caninefeline rotaviruses [40] , suggesting potential transmission of canine-like RVA strains to simians. Although the genetic relationship of VP7 sequences between the four bat RVA strains and ITA/RRV is relatively distant, they might share a common ancestor. In light of the fact that the four bat RVA strains are not closely related to any known RVA strain, we speculate that these viruses are true bat RVA strains rather than viruses transmitted from other species.",

In another study only 12 picornaviruspositive respiratory and alimentary specimens were identified from 1108 bats and 18 species [18] . The lack of CVs and PiVs detected in our study may be accounted for by low carrying rates for these two viruses. Other causes might be variations in duration of the virus shedding in feces, or geographical/seasonal/bat species differences.",
