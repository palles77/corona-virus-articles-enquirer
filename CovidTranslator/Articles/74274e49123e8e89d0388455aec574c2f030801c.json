            "text": "The RNA genomes of coronaviruses, which range from 26 to 32 kb in length, are the largest viral RNA genomes. Coronaviruses cause diseases of the upper and lower respiratory tracts, gastroenteritis, and central nervous system infections in a number of avian and mammalian hosts including humans (Masters, 2006) . Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a member of the order Nidovirales, and are classified into three different antigenic groups on the basis of their genetic and antigenic relationships. However, divergent coronaviruses have been identified recently in bats and wild carnivores, which suggests that the taxonomy should be revised (Dong et al., 2007) . Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the prototype member of the group 3 coronaviruses. As is the case for other coronaviruses, IBV contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S glycoprotein is a large type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion (Hofmann et al., 2004) . It consists of the N-terminal S1 and Cterminal S2 subunits, which are generated during post-translational cleavage of S. The N protein is a phosphoprotein that interacts with the viral RNA genome to form a long, flexible, helical nucleocapsid. The E protein is a minor virion component that possesses ion channel activity that is important for virus entry and assembly.",

            "text": "The M protein is the most abundant constituent of coronaviruses and gives the virion envelope its shape. It is a multispanning membrane protein with a small, N-terminal domain that is located on the exterior of the virion, or in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. This ectodomain is followed by three transmembrane segments and a large C-terminus that comprises the major part of the molecule. This latter domain is situated within the interior of the virion or on the cytoplasmic face of intracellular membranes (Masters, 2006) . M proteins are moderately well conserved within each coronavirus group, but they are quite divergent across the three groups. The region of the M protein that is most conserved among all the coronaviruses is a segment of approximately 25 residues that encompasses the end of the third transmembrane domain and the start of the endodomain; a portion of this segment even retains homology to its torovirus counterpart (den Boon et al., 1991) . The ectodomain, which is the least conserved part of the M protein, is glycosylated. For the M protein of IBV, the entire ectodomain was found to be protease sensitive. However, at the other end of the molecule, no more than 20~25 amino acids could be removed from the C-terminus by protease treatment (Rottier et al., 1984; Cavanagh et al., 1986) . These results suggest that almost the entire endodomain of M is associated tightly with the surface of the membrane or that it Liu et al. (2006b) has an unusually compact structure that is refractory to proteolysis (Masters, 2006) . Specific interactions between proteins, such as between an antibody and its antigen or between an enzyme and its inhibitor, are mediated through the molecular recognition of subsites on both binding partners. Antigenic epitopes are well-characterized subsites that mediate the interaction between an antibody and its antigen. B-cell epitopes are antigenic determinants that are recognized and bound by membrane-bound receptors on the surface of B lymphocytes (Baggio et al., 2002) . They can be classified into two types: linear (continuous) epitopes and conformational (discontinuous) epitopes. Linear epitopes are short peptides that correspond to a contiguous amino acid sequence within a protein (Barlow et al., 1986; Langeveld et al., 2001 ). In contrast, conformational epitopes are composed of amino acids that are not contiguous in the primary sequence, but are brought into close proximity within the folded protein structure. It is believed that a large majority of B-cell epitopes are discontinuous (Walter, 1986 ) and many methods have been used to identify B-cell epitopes (Roggen, 2006) .",

            "text": "Characterization of the location of viral protein epitopes and their degree of conservation is important to allow the antigenic structure and virus-antibody interactions to be understood at the molecular level. It is also very important for vaccine design and other clinical applications. Until now, mapping of the antigenic epitopes of IBV structural proteins has focused mainly on the S and N proteins. The S1 glycoprotein induces the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies that show cross-reactivity in an ELISA and cellmediated immune (CMI) responses Galli, 1994, 1995) . Several antigenic epitopes that induce the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies have been mapped within the hyper-variable region of S1 at amino acid residues 24~61 and 132~149, and also outside the hyper-variable region at amino acids 291~398 (Niesters et al., 1987; Kusters et al., 1989; Koch et al., 1990; Kant et al., 1992; Moore et al., 1997; Johnson et al., 2003) . All the epitopes identified were dependent on conformation Kant et al., 1992) , and the main tool that was used to map antigenic epitopes on S1 was MAbs. Two antigenic regions have been identified within S2. They are located near the N-terminus of the subunit between amino acids 546~577 of the intact S protein Lenstra et al., 1989) . The N protein induces high titers of antibodies that show cross-reactivity in an ELISA and also CMI responses (Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994; Seo et al., 1997) . B-cell epitopes have been mapped to the C-terminal portion of N (Seah et al., 2000) , and a region between amino acid residues 78~94 was identified that induces a T-cell response (Boots et al., 1991) . In addition, several other previously-unknown antigenic epitopes on the S and N proteins of IBV have been identified in a recent study (Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2005) . However, little is known about the ability of the M protein of IBV to induce antibodies that show cross-reactivity between different serotypes, and antigenic epitopes in the M protein have not been identified.",

This indicated that the sequence that is shared by MP4-2 and MP4-3 (MP5: 198 KRFATFVYAKQSV 209 ) contained the epitope that is recognized by MAb 15E2. To map the epitope in greater detail, a series of truncated peptides that were derived from MP5 were obtained and subjected to western blotting. The results showed that the minimal sequence required appeared to be 199 FATFVYAK 206 , because deletion of F 198 or K 205 destroyed the binding of the GST fusion peptides by MAb 15E2 (Fig. 5A) . Therefore, this linear site is the MAb 15E2-defined epitope in the M protein of IBV strain CK/CH/LHLJ/04V. The results were confirmed by ELISA using the same truncated peptides as coating antigens (Fig.  5A) . Thus, we concluded that the linear B-cell epitope in the M protein of IBV that is recognized by MAb 15E2 can be localized exactly to 199 FATFVYAK 206 (Fig. 5C ).

It has been reported that the S protein interacts with the transmembrane region of M (Cavanagh, 2007) . However, the roles of the M protein in IBV replication, immunogenicity, and pathogenicity need to be investigated further. In this study, we expressed the C-terminal 129 amino acids of the IBV M protein (MP2) and found that this fragment showed good reactivity with antibodies against IBV. This indicated that this recombinant protein had similar antigenicity to the native IBV antigen and could be used as an immunogen for animal immunization. The S and N proteins of coronaviruses, rather than the M protein, are the main protein inducers of the host immune responses (Ignjatovic and Sapats, 1994) . Hence, in the present study, we immunized mice first with IBV CK/CH/LHLJ/04V virus particles and then performed two booster immunizations with recombinant M protein to produce MAbs by hybridoma technology.

Two methods, western blotting and ELISA, were used to screen for the epitope. It was demonstrated that the minimal sequence (\"core sequence\") of the MAb 15E2-defined epitope appeared to be 199 FATFVYAK 206 , because deletion of any of the residues from either end of 199 FATFVYAK 206 destroyed the ability of MAb 15E2 to bind. MAb 15E2 was not a neutralizing antibody, as demonstrated by the determination of EID50. The absence of neutralizing activity against IBV may indicate that this region has low immunogenicity or, more probably, that this region is not exposed on the surface of the virion. Indeed, the epitope 199 FATFVYAK 206 is located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (or inside the virion) according to the structure of coronavirus M protein. Interestingly, both the ascites that contained MAb 15E2 and that which contained a control MAb unrelated to IBV could \"neutralize\" IBV CK/CH/LHLJ/04V, as compared with PBS. However, unpurified ascites was used in the present study and it is likely that non-specific components in the ascites rather than MAb 15E2 itself killed the IBV in the in vitro neutralization test.",

            "text": "Given that MAb 15E2 lacks neutralizing activity, it is of little importance for the design of potential subunit vaccines to protect against IBV. However, considering the conservation between chicken and turkey coronaviruses, MAb 15E2 and its defined epitope may be useful for diagnostic purposes. It has been proposed that coronaviruses isolated from turkeys (TCoV) and chickens (IBV) should be considered as distinct species (Cavanagh, 2005) . The S gene of TCoV strain MG10 showed only 57% identity to different strains of IBV. However, the M genes of the two viruses shared 93% identity (Cao et al., 2008; Gomaa et al., 2008) . In this study, the epitope that was identified in the M protein of IBV is highly conserved in turkey coronaviruses. Until now, little has been known about the antigenic epitopes within the structural proteins of turkey coronaviruses. The conserved epitope shared by the M proteins of turkey coronaviruses and IBV is of significance because not only are the two viruses of economic importance to the poultry industry, but they also show antigenic and biological similarities when compared with other coronaviruses. In recent years, coronaviruses have been identified from the beluga whale (Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008) and three different wild birds (bulbul, thrush, and munia) (Woo et al., 2008) . Comparative analysis of their complete genome sequences revealed that they all belong to group 3 of the coronaviruses. However, the coronaviruses from the whale and wild birds were clustered into subgroups 3b and 3c, respectively, by phylogenetic analysis using the chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol), helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid proteins (Woo et al., 2008) and are distantly related to IBV and TCoV, which belong to subgroup 3a. In this study, we found that only two to four residues in the MAb 15E2-defined epitope region of the M protein were shared invariably between IBV and coronaviruses in subgroups 3b and 3c. This was similar to the amino acids shared between IBV and coronaviruses in groups 1 and 2. The roles of the residues in the epitope region that are conserved among different groups and subgroups of coronaviruses require further investigation. Group 3 coronaviruses were also identified in or isolated recently from pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) (Cavanagh et al., 2002; Cavanagh, 2005) , graylag geese (Anser anser), feral pigeons (Columbia livia), and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) (Jonassen et al., 2005) , and a green-cheeked Amazon parrot (Amazon viridigenalis Cassin) (Gough et al., 2006) . Due to the fact that the sequence of the M gene in these coronaviruses is not known, we could not determine the degree of conservation of the Mab 15E2-defined epitope sequence in these viruses.",

The M proteins of IBV and SARS-CoV contain only N-linked sugars and Nglycosylation is initiated by the polypeptide in the endoplasmic reticulum at asparagine residues (de Haan and Rottier, 2005) . In the present study, the molecular weights of the proteins in IBV CK/CH/LHN/00I that reacted with MAb 15E2 were obviously lower than those of the proteins in the other IBV strains selected. The MAb 15E2-defined sequence in strain CK/CH/LHN/00I (GenBank accession no. EF602456) (Liu et al., 2008b) showed a high degree of conservation with that of strain CK/CH/LHLJ/04V ( 199 FATFVYAK 206 ) in the present study. Hence, the bands in strain CK/CH/LHN/ 00I that react with MAb 15E2 during western blotting should be specific. The discrepancy in the molecular weight of the M protein between CK/CH/LHN/00I and the other IBV strains selected may be related to different degrees of glycosylation within the M protein. However, additional investigations may be required.",

To our knowledge, this is the first report of the mapping of a B-cell epitope in the M protein of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus. To date, several methods have been used to map antigenic epitopes (Roggen, 2006) . The advantage of mapping epitopes via expression in prokaryotes is that, once the subclones have been generated, it is possible to screen a large number of MAbs rapidly. Therefore, the truncated recombinant proteins that were used in this study may be useful tools for mapping other potential epitopes on the IBV M protein in future studies. ",
