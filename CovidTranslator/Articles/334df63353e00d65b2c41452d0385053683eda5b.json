Moreover, the input/output transmission networks of the SARS epidemic are built according to the definition of in-out flow. The spatiotemporal distribution of the SARS in-out flow, spatial distribution and temporal change of node characteristic parameters, and the structural characteristics of the SARS transmission networks are comprehensively and systematically explored. The results show that (1) Beijing and Guangdong had the highest risk of self-spread and output cases, and prevention/control measures directed toward self-spread cases in Beijing should have focused on the later period of the SARS epidemic; (2) the SARS transmission networks in mainland China had significant clustering characteristics, with two clustering areas of output cases centered in Beijing and Guangdong; (3) Guangdong was the original source of the SARS epidemic, and while the infected cases of most other provinces occurred mainly during the early period, there was no significant spread to the surrounding provinces; in contrast, although the input/output interactions between Beijing and the other provinces countrywide began during the mid-late epidemic period, SARS in Beijing showed a significant capacity for spatial spreading; (4) Guangdong had a significant range of spatial spreading throughout the entire epidemic period, while Beijing and its surrounding provinces formed a separate, significant range of high-risk spreading during the mid-late period; especially in late period, the influence range of Beijing's neighboring provinces, such as Hebei, was even slightly larger than that of Beijing; and (5) the input network had a low-intensity spread capacity and middle-level influence range, while the output network had an extensive high-intensity spread capacity and influence range that covered almost the entire country, and this spread and influence indicated that significant clustering characteristics increased gradually. This analysis of the epidemic in-out flow and its corresponding transmission network helps reveal the potential spatiotemporal characteristics and evolvement mechanism of the SARS epidemic and provides more effective theoretical support for prevention and control measures.

This retrospective and macroscopic research helps thoroughly recognize the spread mechanism of existing infectious diseases on a spatialtemporal scale and provides some probable scientific basis for researching other unknown infectious diseases.

Some microscopic research, such as the simulation and prediction of the SARS epidemic process based on system dynamics and a multi-agent system [12, 13] and simulation of the spread mechanisms based on models of small-world network and scale-free network [14, 15] , has concentrated on the activity rules of individuals and influences of control parameters of the epidemic spread mechanism; however, character transformation between individuals and influences of individual spatial activity during the epidemic process have rarely been considered.",

During the entire epidemic process, susceptible individuals first became infected, then became infectious, received treatment after the symptoms appeared and, finally, recovered. There are many epidemic characters for individuals. Meanwhile, there are corresponding spatial locations for the various individual characters and the spatial-temporal changes of these individuals during the process of susceptible-infectedsymptomatic-treated-recovered cause different infectious strengths and ranges. From another perspective, regions have inputs and outputs of the epidemic spread according to the location changes of individuals with various epidemic characters, and there are interaction mechanisms between individuals and regions. Similar to other complex networks that exist in the real world, such as gene networks in biological systems, computer networks and social networks, the interactions between individuals and regions form a complex dynamic network of epidemic spread, and by analyzing the structure and characteristics of the epidemic spread network, some potential spread mechanisms may be recognized and shown to be the driving effects of various factors in the SARS epidemic.",

The original data were stored as data sheets, and the individual onset time, which was selected as temporal information, was directly applied for quantitative analysis in a Time-Date format. Three typical locations (working unit/home address, onset location and reporting unit) were selected for modeling the SARS epidemic in-out flow; this information was stored in Text format in the original data, and the description scales were not uniform. Therefore, the spatial data processing first required that the scales of the three locations should be converted into a consistent province or municipality, and second, the selected data had at least two integrated locations; thus, individuals whose data had two or three missing locations were eliminated. There were about 99.75% of original individual cases in mainland China selected in the final dataset, and the three location data were matched artificially and manually with geographical administrative maps with a scale of 1 : 1000000.",

In several studies of epidemic transmission and spatial-temporal simulation, only a single variable of spatial information, such as onset location, was considered. Susceptible individuals had periods of being infected, exposed and treated, which corresponded with multiple spatial data, such as the infected, onset and treatment locations. In contrast with other epidemic models, the in-out flow model primarily focuses on the location transformation process of infected individuals during the epidemic transmission period, and this model explores the spread mechanism of epidemic transmission inputs and outputs between regions on various scales. Epidemic in-out flow can be defined by considering the three typical location data of individuals during an epidemic period: working unit or home address (S1), onset location (S2) and reporting unit (S3). S1 is considered the main residence of individuals because the working unit and home address are the two most important locations. S2 is used as the approximate infection location of the individuals. The exposure period of most infectious diseases is short, and the spatial-temporal information of infected individuals is difficult to collect; therefore, the onset location is used instead of the infection location. S3 commonly represents the treatment location of the infected individuals and is collected using the last medical units.",

Additionally, those who have the residence of Beijing and also receive treatment in Beijing are self-spread cases of Beijing. Moreover, considering the infection location of the individuals, the inputs and outputs could be categorized as primary and secondary types.

Based on the definition of an epidemic in-out flow, there were two types of input and output flows in mainland China during the SARS epidemic spread period. Different regions had various inputs and outputs in a time sequence, and the in-out flows of different regions comprised directed and weighted transmission networks that were dynamically changing. Two types of SARS transmission networks, including an input network and output network, described the transformation directions and weights of infected cases and indicated the dynamic interactions between provinces or municipalities during the epidemic spread process.",

The input flow network showed the input cases from other nodes to a particular node, and the output flow network indicated the output cases from a particular node to the other nodes, while the weight values of the edges indicated the statistical number of input/output cases. In the input and output flow networks, the values of the in-degree and out-degree of the nodes were calculated, indicating the levels of the input/output risk of the nodes. As illustrated in Figure 3 , the spatial distribution of the node in-degree in the input flow network showed that the overall connection density was not high because there was only a small number of edges (84), and most of the weight values of the connecting edges were as low as 10 or less, except for the weight values of the edges between the central provinces (Beijing and Guangdong) of the SARS epidemic. Additionally, a few provinces surrounding these central provinces were at a level of 10-33. Furthermore, the distributions of the in-degree values of the nodes did not show significant spatial clustering characteristics. In detail, the in-degree values of Beijing and Guangdong were highest at 21 and 22, respectively, and the higher values were those of a few surrounding provinces, with values of 10-20, while the in-degree values of the other provinces were less than 10. The spatial distribution of the node out-degree in the output flow network is shown in Figure 4 . The corresponding overall connection density was very high because there were as many as 265 edges in the output network, and the weight values of a certain number of edges were above 50, while the weight values of the edges from Beijing to Guangdong and Guangdong to Beijing were very high at 90 and 121, respectively. The distribution of the node out-degree had significant characteristics of spatial clustering, with Beijing and Guangdong as the clustering centers, and Sichuan in the west also had an impressive out-degree value. Some findings obtained based on the above analysis were as follows: (1) the SARS transmission network of mainland China had significant characteristics of spatial clustering in the output flow and two clustering centers: Beijing and Guangdong; (2) there were a small number of edges and low weight values, and there was no distinct clustering characteristics in the input flow network, which indicated that there was only a small range of risk spread caused by infected cases from onset to treatment, and control measures for infected cases, such as isolation, were remarkably effective; and (3) Sichuan had a particularly large range of output spreading, which indicated that it was necessary to implement priority control measures in provinces with mainly an output floating population during the SARS epidemic.",

The results suggested that (1) the out-degree of Guangdong in the input flow network appeared as early as the beginning of January 2003, and its corresponding in-degree began in early February, indicating that Guangdong was the early original source of the SARS epidemic, from which the infections in many other provinces were at an early time ; (2) the in-degree and out-degree of Beijing in the input flow network appeared to occur as late as in early-mid March, and the in-degree and out-degree of Beijing's three surrounding provinces (Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia) also appeared late, indicating that control measures had taken effect in the early-mid period of the SARS epidemic in regions centered in Beijing, while the input cases from other provinces increased dramatically in the mid-late epidemic period due to the substantial increase of the range of epidemic spread; (3) the in-degree and out-degree of Guang-dong in the output flow network appeared early, and the in-degree increased to a maximum value in early February and was then maintained at the same value, indicating that Guangdong was the primary origin of the SARS epidemic in the early period and that there were continuous output cases from Guangdong to the other provinces throughout the entire epidemic period; and (4) in the output flow net-work, the in-degree and out-degree of Beijing and its three surrounding provinces (Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia) appeared late and gradually spread to the national level during the mid-late period. The following interpretation was obtained from the above comprehensive analysis: Guangdong and Beijing were the two most severely affected provinces during the SARS epidemic in mainland China, but the characteristics and features of their epidemic spread were essentially different from each other. In particular, Guangdong was the original source of the SARS epidemic during the early-mid period and continued to output infections to other provinces throughout the whole epidemic period, but no clustering area formed with Guangdong as the center. However, although there was no obvious interaction of the input and output flows between Beijing and the other countrywide provinces until the mid-late period, Beijing had a distinct high-level capacity for spatial spreading and formed a clustering area for the SARS epidemic with its surrounding provinces (Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia).",

However, there were a certain number of cold nodes with clustering coefficient values equal to 1, mainly because the number of nodes connected to nodes with a full connection load was too small to reflect the clustering characteristics. In the output flow network, with its distinctly high connection density, the statistical results of the node clustering coefficient could directly characterize the clustering feature; in addition, the betweenness centrality of most nodes was high. The combination analysis of the spatial distributions of the clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality in the input flow network and output flow network, which are shown in Figures 6 and 7 , respectively, indicated that (1) the distribution of the clustering coefficient in the input flow network had no significant clustering characteristics and the clustering coefficient of hotspot nodes of the SARS epidemic, including Beijing and Guangdong, was also not high, indicating that although there were several other nodes from which the input cases of hotspots nodes arose, these source nodes were too cold to form a cluster with each other; (2) in the output flow network, the distribution of the clustering coefficient of the nodes had significant clustering characteristics, and the connection density between the nodes connected to Beijing and Guangdong was very high, while the distribution of the nodes connected to Beijing and Guangdong was relatively concentrated mainly in the north, east and southwest of main-land China; (3) in the input flow network, the betweenness centrality distribution was also concentrated mainly in Guangdong and Beijing with its surrounding provinces showing that the spatial floating of the input cases had some clustering characteristics; and (4) several provinces surrounding Beijing and Guangdong formed a distance clustering trend in the output flow network, indicating that the spatial floating of output cases mainly covered a range between Beijing, Guangdong and their surrounding provinces.",

The betweenness centrality value of Guangdong continued to increase, indicating that Guangdong carried the most information of input flow throughout the entire period; in contrast, Beijing and its surrounding Hebei, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia carried only a small part of the information of input flow during the early period and gradually increased through the late period; (5) in the output flow network, the betweenness centrality value in Guangdong appeared early, with a high value, and rapidly increased to the maximum value without decreasing until late in the epidemic, indicating that Guangdong began to output cases to many provinces since the early epidemic period, and that its output flow rapidly covered an almost nationwide scope; in the mid-late period, after another hotspot clustering area was formed in Beijing and its surrounding provinces, where the influence sphere of the output flow from Guangdong gradually weakened; and (6) the betweenness centrality value of Beijing appeared during the early period and increased gradually in the output flow network while forming a larger sphere of influence, and the nodes surrounding Beijing maintained the same output flow spread level, while during the late period, Hebei had an even higher level of spread range than Beijing, indicating that control measures for the nodes surrounding Beijing should be strengthened during the later epidemic, especially for the Hebei Province.",

The temporal changes of the structural characteristics of the two types of networks were analyzed in a one-day time interval. Figure 9 illustrates the temporal changes of the diameter, average distance and average degree of the input/output flow networks. The results showed that (1) the overall connection density of the input flow network was low, and its diameter, average distance and average degree were at a low value, with a slow integrated increasing trend; (2) in the input flow network, the maximum values of the average degree and average distance were 2.54 and 4.94, respectively, indicating that the number of nodes with input flow spreading was small and that the spreading range was also low; (3) the maximum value of the diameter in the input flow network was 20, indicating that the spreading range of the input flow belonged to a middle level on the national scale; (4) in the output flow network with high connection density, the average degree value appeared early and expanded rapidly to a maximum value of 14 during the mid-late period, indicating that the number of objects affected by the output flow was large; (5) the average distance value in the output flow network appeared early in the epidemic, increased rapidly to a maximum of 14 and then had a small irregular decreasing trend, indicating that the spreading intensity of the output flow was very strong during the early-mid period and effectively controlled to a certain extent, when control measures were strengthened later in the epidemic; and (6) in the output flow network, the diameter value rapidly increased to a maximum value of 41 and showed a clear decreasing trend in the late epidemic period, indicating that the spreading range of the output flow covered the nation in only the mid-epidemic period and was apparently controlled until the mid-late period with strengthened control measures.",

The exploration and study of the spatiotemporal characteristics and patterns of epidemic spread extensively aid the understanding of the spread mechanism and provide theoretical support for the prevention and control of future novel epidemics. Extensive research on epidemic spread mechanisms has been conducted in pathology, epidemiology, medical statistics, spatial information science, sociology, and anthropology, among other fields, and the results have provided detailed explanations regarding spread mechanisms, spatiotemporal distribution and prevention/control measures. However, the systematic understanding and explanation of spatiotemporal change patterns of the individual susceptible-infected-symptomatictreated-recovered epidemic process and dynamics that direct the transmission network between individuals and regions caused by interactions of information and material flow are still lacking. In this paper, the SARS epidemic in mainland China in 2002-2003 was used as an example. Based on key data regarding individual location change in the process of being infected, disease onset, receiving treatment and recovery, the concept of in-out flow was defined to effectively explain the spatiotemporal evolution pattern of the individual location transformation in the SARS epidemic and characteristics of information and material flow in the dynamic transmission network caused by the input/output interactions between regions. The transmission network of the SARS epidemic was built based on the in-out flow, and the spatiotemporal distribution of the SARS in-out flow, the spatial distribution and temporal change of node characteristic indicators, and the network structure characteristics were comprehensively and systematically implemented, resulting in a series of new conclusions. Future research based on these two new perspectives, including the epidemic in-out flow and transmission network, may help explain the spatiotemporal spread pattern of infectious diseases and provide new study ideas and practical implications, including results revealing the characteristics and laws of the SARS epidemic in mainland China.",
