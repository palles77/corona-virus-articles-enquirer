Methods: This study employed a mixed-methods approach. An online questionnaire surveyed academic coordinators of clinical education (ACCEs, n \u00bc 14) on the availability, destinations, and number of ICIs from 1997 to 2007. Semi-structured telephone interviews were then conducted with eight PT students, seven ACCEs, and three supervising clinicians to investigate their ICI experiences. Interview transcripts were coded descriptively and thematically using NVivo. Results: ICIs are currently available at 12 of 14 Canadian PT schools. A total of 313 students participated in ICIs in 51 different destination countries from 1997 to 2007. Over this period, increasing numbers of students participated in ICIs and developing countries represented an increasing proportion of ICI destinations. Key themes identified in the interviews were opportunities, challenges, and facilitating factors. Conclusions: ICIs present unique opportunities for Canadian PT students. Recommendations to enhance the quality of future ICIs are (1) clearly defined objectives for ICIs, (2) additional follow-up post-ICI, and (3) improved record keeping and sharing of information on ICI destination countries and host sites.

            "text": "Global health is an increasingly important area of study and practice for physical therapists. Global health draws on a philosophy of health and human rights and seeks to provide a certain standard of health and health care for individuals worldwide. 1 Global health addresses the impact of factors beyond government agencies and non-governmental organizations and involves considering the health needs of people worldwide above the concerns of particular nations. 2 The global health landscape has changed in the last decade, largely as a result of globalization; such changes include increased income inequality and poverty, both of which are related to disability and affect the accessibility and delivery of health care, in both developed and developing countries. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Physical therapy (PT) may have a unique role in addressing disability and its relationship to poverty through rehabilitation and mobility. 5 Furthermore, it has been suggested by the World Confederation for Physical Therapy (WCPT) that, as health professionals, ''physical therapists are obliged to work toward achieving justice in the provision of health services for all people.'' 7(p.6) In order to meet the future challenges facing PT as a profession with global responsibilities, physical therapists need to receive relevant education that prepares them to work internationally and establishes a core foundation of social responsibility. 3, 8 The profession's growing role in global health requires entry-level education that emphasizes not only clinical competence but also adaptability, problem solving, and an understanding of the impact of globalization on health systems and individual wellness. 3, 9 One strategy to prepare PT students for their future professional responsibilities is through clinical internships in other countries. An international clinical internship (ICI) can be defined as any clinical internship completed anywhere outside Canada by a PT student as part of his or her formal clinical education through a Canadian PT programme. Clinical internships are essential for the consolidation of theoretical knowledge and practical skills for PT students; 10 ICIs may also provide opportunities for students to gain an appreciation for cultural differences in perceptions of health and illness and to experience different models of health care delivery. 5, 9 In addition to providing work experience in an international setting, ICIs may also prepare PT students for work in the changing ethno-cultural background of Canada. Between 2001 and , the number of Canadian residents born outside of Canada grew by 13 .6%, and in 2006, one in five Canadian residents were foreign born. 11 Additionally, the delivery of health care in Canada is influenced by global health issues, particularly as increased international travel brings people from around the world to Canada. 12 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a notable example of how global health issues affect Canadians, with devastating consequences on health care systems, patients, and health care providers. 13 An integral objective of international clinical experience is to allow students to adapt their knowledge, skills, and professional behaviour to unfamiliar situations within unique cultural and ethical frameworks. 5, 14 Jung et al. have described international experiences for PT students' ICIs within a single university programme, 14 and other authors have outlined the importance of incorporating international themes in PT curricula, including fostering an appreciation of globalization and the political context of health care. 3, 9 However, there is no published research that specifically addresses ICIs as part of PT clinical education. Understanding the ICI experiences of PT students may give Canadian PT educational institutions a crucial starting point from which to define their role. Despite the lack of research specifically involving PT students, evidence supporting international clinical experience (ICE) as part of formal education for medical and nursing students has been encouraging, showing a positive impact on personal and professional development. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] The supporting literature from the medical and nursing professions has included ICE in both developed and developing countries. Global health experience in developing environments has been shown to expose students to clinical situations and patient relationships different from those they typically experience in developed settings. 1,21 Following ICEs, nursing students reported gaining an appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of their own country's health care system as well as insights into disparities in global health care systems. 16 Medical and nursing students also reported a greater awareness of cultural differences, as well as increased self-confidence, self-awareness, coping skills, and leadership skills. 14, 16 As a positive demonstration of the lasting effects of such experiences, nursing students who participated in international education were more likely to continue to pursue international experiences in their future employment, volunteer, and education opportunities. 17, 18 Canadian PT students may benefit from ICIs in ways that parallel the positive effects demonstrated for students in other health professions; however, ICI experiences for Canadian PT students have yet to be examined. The present study addresses this gap in the literature by describing the history, current trends, and future implications of ICIs in Canadian PT clinical education. The research objectives were (1) to describe the history and current status of ICIs for Canadian PT students; (2) to explore the opportunities, challenges, and lessons learned regarding ICIs for Canadian PT students from the perspectives of ACCEs, students, and supervising clinicians involved in ICIs; and (3) to determine the implications for future ICI programmes for Canadian PT students and for future research. This information may be used to further develop clinical education programmes that address the new and evolving roles of Canadian physical therapists, both in Canada and abroad.",

Consequently, the learning objectives of ICIs may need to change to reflect the unique opportunities presented by these two trends. ICIs in developing countries may present unique opportunities for students to develop a greater appreciation for cultural differences, resource management, and community health needs. Our findings suggest that ICIs in developing countries may be beneficial to PT students both because the skills and experiences gained in these internships can contribute positively to their personal and professional development and because students develop more interest in and gain a better appreciation of health issues affecting developing communities. Similarly, research has demonstrated that international health experiences help students in other health disciplines to acquire knowledge and skills relevant to appreciating patients' cultural differences, the multi-factorial influences on health, problem-solving skills, and evidence-based medicine. 17, [19] [20] [21] Research also suggests that international education opportunities foster an appreciation for the impact of globalization on health care delivery and help strengthen the commitment to practice in under-served areas. 18, 21 Our findings suggest that whether students worked alongside or were supervised by members of other health professions, ICIs incorporating IPE were positive learning experiences. Research has demonstrated that IPE has led to improved communication among health professionals, which facilitates goal setting and clarifies patient objectives, ultimately improving patient care. 29 Collaboration between professionals can also increase cultural knowledge and provide solutions in situations where cultural differences affect health care delivery. 30, 31 ICIs allow student exposure to global health issues in settings where inter-professional relationships can enhance the successful delivery of health care.

Follow-up activities that currently exist for students following ICIs include debriefing sessions with ACCEs to discuss and reflect on the ICI and presentations by students to share their ICI experiences with others. For many students, ICIs take place at the end of the PT curriculum, and formal follow-up activities are not always possible. Establishing formal follow-up opportunities for students, and building on the follow-up activities that already exist, could enable students and ACCEs to discuss opportunities and challenges experienced during the ICI, allowing for improved ability to develop specific future preparatory activities, learning objectives, and relevant contingency plans. Follow-up activities for students also provide an opportunity to engage in ''reflection on action,'' in which students consider challenging situations that occurred during their clinical experience. 32 Structured time for reflective practice following ICIs could contribute to students' professional development; through this reflection, students can identify areas of strength and areas for improvement, as well as developing an action plan for the future. 33",

The limited nature of the formal record-keeping systems currently in place has potential effects on both the resources available to schools attempting to organize ICIs and the results of this study. Record-keeping difficulties limit the ability of PT programmes to evaluate ICIs effectively and hinder the establishment of ongoing relationships with host sites. Limited record keeping and difficulty in accessing information on ICIs were identified as challenges by ACCEs during the interviews and further documented by incomplete reporting of the number of students and destination countries on the questionnaire. This lack of data limits both the quantitative and the qualitative results of our study, as our findings reflect only the information that ACCEs were able to provide. The survey allowed ACCEs to answer ''unknown'' when asked for the number of students participating in ICIs or the destination countries for a given year, so that they could complete the survey even if they did not have access to complete records for the entire period under study. Though ACCEs representing all Canadian PT programmes completed the questionnaire, information obtained on the history of ICIs was incomplete, and therefore we are not able to produce meaningful descriptions of ICIs at individual universities. This study represents an initial description of the history and current state of ICIs undertaken by Canadian PT students.",

Though half of all Canadian ACCEs participated in interviews, relatively few students and supervising clinicians were interviewed. Barriers to recruiting students included privacy restrictions at universities, which precluded the distribution of student contact information and unsolicited invitations to par-ticipate in research based in unaffiliated institutions. Recruiting supervising clinicians was particularly challenging: recruiting primarily through e-mail and online forums may have tended to exclude clinicians outside Canada who work in settings with limited access to the Internet. In addition to electronic mailing lists related to international health and physical therapy, we also employed snowball sampling. Distributing recruitment information through these outlets creates a potential recruiting bias toward individuals who have an interest in international health and favour ICI experiences for students. To facilitate recruitment of students and supervising clinicians in future studies, it would be beneficial to have access to more extensive records of students and clinicians who have taken part in ICIs.",

With clear learning objectives, all groups involved are better informed as to the overall purpose of the ICI. Ultimately, the resource-intensive process of organizing and preparing for an ICI is not only justified but facilitated by the establishment of specific learning objectives. Follow-up activities may provide information to enhance the preparation of students, PT schools, and host sites for future ICIs. Follow-up also benefits host sites, as information sharing allows ICIs to better address the host community's health care needs. In addition, follow-up assists both in establishing appropriate objectives for subsequent internships and in providing information to improve record keeping. Success in organizing ICIs, preparing students, and conducting follow-up requires a substantial amount of record keeping on the part of ACCEs. With access to information about previous student experiences, ACCEs are better able to facilitate the organization process and help future students select an ICI that meets their learning objectives. We recommend that ACCEs continue to collect information about ICIs, so that they can support future students in accessing information about positive learning opportunities and potential challenges.",
