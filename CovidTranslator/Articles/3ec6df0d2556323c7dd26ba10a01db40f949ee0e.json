These neutrophils predominate in relatively nontoxic environments such as immune-mediated diseases ( Fig. 2-7A ), neoplastic lesions , and sterile conditions caused by irritants such as urine and bile ( Fig. 2-7C ). Degenerate neutrophils display early signs of oncotic necrosis with observable cellular and nuclear swelling with decreased nuclear stain intensity. In cytology, this early recognizable change is termed karyolysis (Fig. 2-8 ). Karyolysis is attributed to decreased mitochondria function to produce ATP that maintains transmembrane ion pumps resulting in an influx of sodium, calcium, and water (hydropic degeneration) as well as to damaged cell membranes that result in release of endonucleases that degrade RNA and DNA. This often indicates rapid cell death in a toxic or injurious environment (Perman et al., 1979) . Degenerate neutrophils predominate in bacterial infections, particularly gram-negative types that produce endotoxins. Cytologically, under conditions of neutrophil degeneration, small infectious agents must be found intracellularly to confidently report it as septic neutrophilic inflammation ( Fig. 2-9 ).",

Lymphoglandular bodies are cytoplasmic fragments from fragile cells, usually lymphocytes, which are discrete, round, lightly basophilic structures (Flanders et al., 1993) . Nuclear streaming refers to linear pink to purple strands of nuclear remnants (Fig. 2-21 ) produced by excessive tissue handling during cytologic preparation or with necrotic material when sampled. Clear to light-pink amorphous strands representing collagen (Fig. 2-22A ) may be admixed with spindle cells and endothelium within a fibrovascular stroma. However, when these collagen fibers undergo damage (as in the collagenolysis associated with mast cell tumor), degranulating eosinophils release collagenase that produces dense, hyalinized pink collagen bands (Fig. 2-22B ). Amyloid is an uncommon pathologic protein found in tissues composed of several types between cells (Woldenmeskel, 2012). It appears amorphous, eosinophilic, and hyaline and may be associated with chronic inflammation, plasma cell tumors (see Fig. 3-54E&F) , or familial amyloidosis (Fig. 2-22C) .",

C, Sediment preparation smear. Cytocentrifuge preparations spread out nucleated cells and may lyse erythrocytes. Samples centrifuged for 5 minutes may result in artifactual erythrophagocytosis by macrophages. This finding should always be compared with the direct smear to be confident it is a real finding. It was not real in this case because the direct smear contained no evidence of erythrophagocytosis. (Modified Wright; HP oil.) D, Scratches. Linear clear streaks in the stained background typically arise from slides contacting other slides during staining or accidental wiping of the slide. E-F, Hemoglobin crystals. Dog. Variable magnifications of pink needle-like crystals that may arise from slow drying of a highly blood contaminated sample. (Modified Wright; HP oil.) G, Ultrasound gel. Dog. Presence of magenta granular precipitate should be ignored if known to be a specimen from material taken under ultrasound guidance. The material is significant when taken from the site of a previous vaccination (seeFig. 3-4). (Modified Wright; HP oil.) H, Stain precipitate and bacteria. Dog. The lower left dark granular material represents residue following methanolic Romanowsky staining. Compare a similar granularity and color to coccoid bacteria in the upper right. (Modified Wright; HP oil.) I, Talc powder or starch granules. Cat. This foreign material is characteristic by the cross mark in the center of the crystal cell. (Modified Wright; HP oil.) FIGURE 2-45 Crystals and crystal-like structures. A, Calcium mineralization. Lung aspirate. Cat. Refractile crystalline material stains light blue in the area of tissue necrosis. (Modified Wright; HP oil.) B, Urate crystals. Joint aspirate. Tortoise. Gout arthritis is noted by the presence of long thin needle-like crystals. (Unstained; HP oil.) C, Cholesterol needle crystals. Perianal mass aspirate. Dog. The background contains numerous linear streaks of various lengths and widths having sharp sides. It is likely the result of tissue damage with release of cell membrane lipids. (Modified Wright; HP oil.) D, Mycobacterial infection. In the proteinaceous background, lipids from the bacterial cell wall create negative streaks of uniform width and length in contrast to crystals. (Romanowsky; HP oil.) (D, Courtesy of Andrew Torrance, Exeter, UK.) FIGURE 2-46 Linear structures. A, Curschmann's spiral. Skin aspirate. Dog. Long linear corkscrew strand is indicative of inspissated mucus that may be found in sites other than the respiratory tract. (Modified Wright; HP oil.) B-C, Blood vessel. Nasal aspirate. Cat. Two magnifications are shown to demonstrate the curving pattern and morphologic components of a capillary. Note the endothelial-lined tube with red blood cells inside. (Modified Wright; IP and HP oil.) D, Synthetic fiber. Blood. Cat. Blue transparent thread found on top red cells as a contaminant structure. The variable width and color are helpful features. (Modified Wright; HP oil.) E, Fungal hyphal segment. Urine. Dog. Degenerate neutrophils surround the structure, which is septated. (Modified Wright; HP oil.) F, Aspergillus fruiting body with conidia. Nasal plaque imprint. Dog. The swollen part of the conidiophore termed the vesicle is covered by a dense cap or phialides from which small round conidia arise, each measuring 3 \u03bcm in diameter. (New methylene blue; HP oil.) G, Muscle fragments. Tissue aspirate. Dog. Presence of deeply basophilic rectangular pieces suggests skeletal muscle. Confirmation is made by higher magnification to see cross-striations (Fig. 2-1) (Modified Wright; IP.) H-I, Fingerprint keratin bars. Near the glass slide edges are numerous individualized squamous epithelial cells represented by dense dark keratin bars. These surface epithelial cells related to excessive handling of the slide may confuse the diagnosis if they appear within the center of the slide and specimen. (Aqueous Romanowsky; LP and IP.)",
