SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta coronavirus genus and its genome is single-stranded, non-segmented positive-sense RNA, which is 29,881 nucleotides in length (2) . It has 84% nucleotide homology with bat SARS-like coronavirus, 78% homology with human SARS virus, and approximately 50% homology with MERS virus (3, 4) . So far, the full-length genomic sequences between virus samples are almost identical (3) , suggesting that no significant mutations have occurred in the virus (5) .",

Therefore, reliable and rapid laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to managing patient care and preventing hospital transmission. For clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, nucleic acid detection or sequencing is currently used in conjunction with pulmonary CT (7) . Real-time reverse-transcription fluorescent PCR (RT-PCR) is the clinical standard for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection (8) . Now, in order to detect SARS-CoV-2 early and control the disease spreading on time, we developed a faster and more convenient method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, named RT-LAMP (reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification). ORF1ab gene, E gene and N gene were selected and primers for them were designed. We have used the RT-LAMP method to detect pathogenic microorganisms and achieved good results (9, 10) . In 2003, RT-LAMP had been reported as a quick and easy diagnostic All rights reserved.

The amplification efficiency of the LAMP method is extremely high, the reaction can be completed within one hour. This method relies on self-recycling strand displacement DNA synthesis by Bst DNA polymerase, and previous studies have described detailed amplification mechanisms (13) . This reaction relies on the recognition of DNA targets by six independent sequences, making this assay highly specific. When the template is RNA, the amplification reaction can be occurred in one step by adding reverse transcriptase, and called RT-LAMP.",

The method can complete nucleic acid amplification in 30 minutes at 60-65 \u2103 constant temperature environment. By RT-LAMP, reverse transcription and amplification can be carried out simultaneously useing RNA as template directly. The detection result can be directly judged through the color change by naked eyes, but without needing special instruments. Besides, RT-LAMP analysis is extremely specific because it uses six to eight primers to identify eight different regions on the target DNA. The RT-LAMP assay reported in this paper has many advantages such as operation simpe, reaction fast and detection accurate. The LAMP method has been used to detect hepatitis B virus DNA, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Mycobacterium avian and Mycobacterium intracellular(13, 16).",
