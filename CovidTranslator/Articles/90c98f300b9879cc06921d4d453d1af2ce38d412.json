Nurses from first through fourth year, medical students from first through fifth year, and residents all study and practice in the medical university and accompanying hospital. Without adequate knowledge or perceived seriousness of contracting a given pandemic, students will not be inclined to comply with recommended behavioral adaptations. As Brug et al have stated, one must first be aware of the potential risk to be motivated enough to begin to adopt any protective measures. 5 Having adequate knowledge and awareness about an infectious outbreak begins with an appropriate implementation of lectures by the university that are essential in affecting the level of concern of medical students. Compliance with infection control measures is directly related to the level of concern; the greater the concern level, the more likely the students will adhere to the appropriate prevention guidelines. The objective of the study is to assess the awareness, perceptions, and behavioral intentions of medical students to the H1N1 pandemic.",

            "text": "Greater perceived risk of susceptibility can lead to greater compliance of health behaviors. 5 We found that only 32% of the students believed themselves to be at a risk of contracting H1N1. This finding is comparable with another study conducted by Eastwood et al, 9 which showed that only 25% of the residents considered themselves to be at a risk of contracting the virus. It is not surprising to find a low perception risk among the students because of the low number of laboratory-confirmed outbreaks reported in the newspaper and media. 4 The use of face masks was met with the most resistance (15%, 36/241) among students aged 18 to 20 years. This finding is consistent with May et al, 10 who reported young adults between 16 and 24 years were the least willing to comply with the use of face masks. The implementation of a face mask in the event of an illness was met with the most resistance from students who did not perceive themselves to be at risk. The low usage of face masks is of concern, placing both patients and colleagues at risk of contamination. The optimism of not being at risk results in a false sense of security and therefore a lack of precaution. Educating students on the utilization of proper CDC guidelines is required to prevent iatrogenic infections. A study conducted by Wong et al assessed the potential spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome among previously healthy medical students and found that specific control measures can prevent the spread of pathogens by respiratory droplets. 11 The recommendation to stay at home when ill was met by resistance in most students. This behavior poses a serious threat of student to colleague and student to patient transmission if infected students do not remain isolated. Brown et al, 12 however, reported the contrary, finding that the majority of their respondents were more likely to self-isolate during an influenza. The factors that led to their decision were not assessed, but universities need to enforce proper compliance to health guidelines and set up alternative teaching sources for students. A study performed by Agahaizu et al 13 on newly emerging infectious diseases revealed that, because of lack of regulation of infection control guidelines, symptomatic health care workers continued to attend their duty and therefore became a risk for transmission of infection.",
