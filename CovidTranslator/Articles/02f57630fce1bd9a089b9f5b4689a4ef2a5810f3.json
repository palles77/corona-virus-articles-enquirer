The first section also includes a number of tables that provide systemic differential diagnosis for ocular signs in the two species. These tables are arranged in the anatomic order of the ocular structures to which they refer (i.e., disorders of the eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, sclera, uvea, etc.) in order to facilitate finding the list of differential diagnosis for a given disorder. The following two sections, also containing similar tables, are devoted to ocular manifestations of systemic diseases in horses and ruminants.",

It may cause inflammation or demyelinization of the optic nerve and tract, lateral geniculate nucleus, optic radiations, and visual cortex. Patients may present with actue, bilateral blindness and fixed, dilated pupils due to severe optic neuritis (Figure 18-1) . The inflammation may be isolated, prodromal, or concurrent with other neurologic signs of canine distemper. The diagnosis of canine distemper is complicated because many dogs are infected but not clinically ill. Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies may be present in conjunctival epithelial cells 5 to 21 days after exposure and may be demonstrated in cytologic smears. Immunofluorescence (IF) techniques for the detection of these inclusion bodies may be used on different cytologic smears, including conjunctival epithelial smears. Recently, CDV amplicons were detected by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of conjunctival swabs of all dogs experimentally with CDV, from day 3 to 14 after infection. The detection rate of these amplicons in conjunctival swabs was significantly higher during most of the experimental period compared to other tissue samples. Ocular treatment, which is essentially symptomatic, consists of topical ophthalmic antibacterial preparations for conjunctivitis and corneal ulcers. Cases of KCS may be treated with artificial tears, topical antibiotics, and lacromimetics. Treatment of severe corneal ulceration may require surgical intervention. Systemic and topical steroids as well as topical atropine are indicated in cases of uveitis. However, atropine should be used with extreme caution if the animal is also suffering from KCS, and steroids may not be used if the cornea is ulcerated. Systemic administration of antiinflammatory dosages of glucocorticosteroids is indicated in an animal with acute optic neuritis following confirming diagnosis of distemper, even if there is no other sign of clinical disease.",

The virus is shed in the feces and urine of infected animals, and dogs are exposed through the oronasal route. After an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, seronegative animals infected by CAV-1 exhibit systemic clinical signs that range from those of a mild upper respiratory disease to those of a severe systemic disease, including hepatomegaly, icterus, and bleeding that may progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation. The prevalence of the disease has been dramatically reduced with the introduction of vaccination. Immunization with attenuated CAV-1 and, to a lesser extent, CAV-2 strains led to ocular signs of anterior uveitis and corneal edema in some animals. Dogs are currently vaccinated mostly with attenuated strains of CAV-2. Ocular signs of infectious canine hepatitis are seen within 7 to 21 days of infection or vaccination. The signs are due to the presence of immune complexes in the eye and occur during convalescence. The initial signs include blepharospasm, miosis, hypotonicity, and anterior chamber flare ( Figure 18 -2) due to anterior uveitis. Corneal edema (\"blue eye\") may develop within 1 to 2 days, although it is bilateral in only 12% to 28% of cases. The edema may be severe and lead to formation of keratoconus. Such cases may progress and cause corneal scarring and pigmentation. Persistent or long-lasting corneal edema may also occur, and the Afghan hound has been described as predisposed to chronic edema and glaucoma. However, in most cases the edema is transient, and animals recover spontaneously within a few days to 2 to 3 weeks.",

Topical tetracycline is frequently added because coinfections with Mycoplasma spp. and/or Chlamydophila felis (formerly Chlamydia psittaci) are common. Topical treatments are frequently continued for several weeks after resolution of clinical signs to prevent recurrence. Stress is a very important factor in the pathogenesis of the clinical disease, and events such as the introduction of a new animal to the household or traveling to cat shows may exacerbate the symptoms. For this reason, frequent treatment with multiple drugs may sometimes aggravate the clinical signs of the disease. If worsening of signs is noted, the clinician is advised to carefully consider reducing treatment rather than increasing it. FELINE CALICIVIRUS INFECTION. Feline calicivirus (FCV), which belongs to the family of caliciviruses, affects only members of the Felidae family. The genus consists of one serotype and many different strains varying in antigenicity and pathogenicity. It is widespread in the domestic cat population, especially in crowded conditions. The epidemiology is very similar to that of FHV-1, and despite extensive vaccinations, many cats are carriers of FCV. Some of these cats remain carriers for life and shed the virus continuously. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection may potentiate FCV shedding from carriers. Infection by FCV occurs through the oronasal and conjunctival routes. The clinical signs may vary owing to differences in virulence and tropism of the different virus strains. They include fever, anorexia, oral and tongue ulceration, and mild respiratory signs (sneezing, nasal discharge). Certain FCV infections may manifest as shifting lameness and pyrexia for 24 to 48 hours, and oral and respiratory signs may be absent. FCV is also involved in chronic gingivitis. Recently, highly virulent strains of FCV have emerged that are associated with high mortality and a new range of clinical signs (FCV-associated virulent systemic disease). The ocular lesions of FCV include mainly conjunctivitis, but the disease is milder than that induced by FHV-1.",

The virus is responsible for a third of feline cancer-related deaths through cell transformation and may also lead to anemia and immunosuppression. The prevalence of FeLV-related diseases has been declining over the past 10 years owing to the introduction of a protective vaccine. The clinical signs of FeLV infection vary with the virus subtype and the body system involved. The ocular disease in FeLV-infected cats may relate to lymphoma, and transformed lymphocytes invade the globe through the uvea, leading initially to a mild uveitis characterized by corneal precipitates.

Macrophages carry FIPV to the tissues and viscera. The exact mechanism responsible for the higher virulence of FIPV compared with FECV is currently unknown. It is postulated, however, that in immunosuppressed cats under a heavy FECV infection and replication load, mutations of FECV are more likely to occur, leading to its increased virulence and transformation to FIPV. Cats become infected with FCoV mainly through ingestion, and the virus replicates in enterocytes and is shed through the feces. It may also replicate in the tonsils, in which case it is shed in the saliva.",

The incidence of FIP is higher in cats from catteries, shelters, and multiple cat households. Stress may predispose cats to the disease. FIP is an immune complex disease resulting from interactions between the virus, or its antigens, and specific antiviral antibodies, complement, and inflammatory cells. The reaction leads to a pyogranulomatous vasculitis that affects the organs supplied by these blood vessels, including the retina (see Chapter 15, Figure 15 -35). Cats with clinical FIP may exhibit an effusive (wet) or a noneffusive (dry) disease. The effusive disease is usually the more acute form. The noneffusive form develops over a longer period and is postulated to result from partial immunity to the virus.",

In mammalian hosts the parasite is seen as the intracellular nonflagellate form, the amastigote, within macrophages. The disease incubation period before the appearance of clinical signs may last months to years, during which the parasite disseminates in the body. Some dogs develop clinical disease, whereas others remain asymptomatic carriers that are infectious to sandflies and can thus transmit the disease to other dogs and humans.

This type is characterized by loss of pancreatic beta cells and subsequent insulin deficiency, leading to hyperglycemia. In contrast, NIDDM is uncommon in dogs, is observed more commonly in cats, and is characterized by insulin resistance. Consequently, insulin concentrations are variable and can be normal, decreased, or increased; however, hyperglycemia is always present. Ketoacidosis is seen more commonly in IDDM than in NIDDM. A transient form of DM has been described in cats, and rarely in dogs, in which some factor predisposes the animals to insulin antagonism and resistance, resulting in persistent hyperglycemia. The elevated glucose concentrations may lead to beta cell refractoriness and even to glucose toxicity and irreversible lesions in beta cell functions.

The tendency for development of a diabetic cataract depends on the activity of aldose reductase in lenticular cells. Aldose reductase is the key enzyme in the formation and accumulation of sorbitol, fructose, and dulcitol in the lens. The resulting hyperosmolarity of the lens leads to fluid ingress with subsequent swelling, fiber rupture, and eventual cataract formation. Activity of aldose reductase in dogs is high in the lens regardless of age, whereas in cats it is significantly higher in those younger than 4 years than in older cats. Because DM occurs primarily in older cats, the relatively low aldose reductase activity protects the feline lens from cataract formation. Blindness due to diabetic cataracts can be corrected only with surgical removal of the lens, although experimental work using aldose reductase inhibitors to prevent the development of diabetic cataracts has shown promising results. The prognosis for successful outcome of surgery is reportedly unaffected by the presence of DM, although perioperative medical management has to be modified to include NSAIDs instead of glucocorticoids, and the incidence of longterm complications may be higher. See Chapter 13 for additional discussion of diabetic cataracts.",

Relative polycythemia is also referred to as erythrocytosis; this term is usually reserved for milder elevations of the hematocrit, most commonly due to hemoconcentration secondary to dehydration, and is a transient condition. True polycythemia can be primary or secondary. Primary polycythemia (polycythemia rubra vera) is a rare myeloproliferative disorder more commonly observed in cats (associated with FeLV infection) than in dogs. It is characterized by an abnormal proliferation of erythrocytes, platelets, and granulocytes; serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations are usually normal or mildly decreased. Secondary polycythemia may be appropriate and inappropriate and is associated with general hypoxemia or hypoxia, respectively. Chronic cardiopulmonary disorders, such as pulmonary neoplasia and right-to-left cardiac shunts, lead to hypoxemia, whereas renal neoplasia or neoplastic disorders of other abdominal organs may cause renal arterial blood flow obstruction and, consequently, renal hypoxia and a resultant increase in EPO concentrations. Hemoglobin disorders may also cause hypoxemia but are extremely rare in dogs and cats. All of these mechanisms lead to increases in production of EPO and its release from the hypoxic kidney, resulting in higher serum EPO concentrations, and, subsequently, in greater erythropoiesis and secondary polycythemia. EPO-secreting tumors have been reported rarely in humans and dogs (leiomyosarcoma, schwannoma) and were associated with secondary inappropriate polycythemia. Polycythemia leads to hyperviscosity, which reduces blood flow in the microcirculation resulting in local tissue hypoxia. The ocular signs include dilated and tortuous dark red to brown conjunctival vessels, and the owner may complain of a \"red eye.\" Similar changes are seen in the retinal vasculature, and retinal vessels are described as having a \"boxcar appearance\" (i.e., intermittent dilatation and constriction of vessels).

The disease usually causes fever and respiratory signs. The name is derived from the propensity of the organism to produce abscesses of lymph nodes, particularly around the head and upper neck, which can lead to suffocation through obstruction of the pharynx. Other lymph nodes, such as the mesenteric nodes, may also be involved; this condition is known as \"bastard strangles.\" Pharyngeal lymph nodes often drain before the horse recovers. The eyes may be involved in a mild inflammatory reaction, including dacryocystitis and transient KCS. The ocular discharge is often serous initially and mucopurulent later. Intraocular manifestations include anterior uveitis, panuveitis, chorioretinitis, retinal detachment, vitreous abscess, and optic neuritis. Ocular discharge and chorioretinal depigmentation in the nontapetal fundus of several horses have been described in one report. The depigmentation resolved spontaneously. In one case, anterior uveitis developed 10 days after Strangles and subsequently progressed to corneal stromal abscesses and 400 panophthalmitis. The organism was cultured from the eye.

Initially there is chemosis and hyperemia of the conjunctiva accompanied by increased lacrimation and blepharospasm. Later, conjunctivitis, keratitis, depigmentation of the lateral limbus, and intraocular lesions are observed. Small, raised, white nodules (0.5 to 2 mm in diameter) in the limbal conjunctiva and punctate, subepithelial corneal opacities of similar size are commonly present. Corneal lesions are often wedge-shaped with the base of the triangle at the limbus and are characterized by varying degrees of superficial and deep neovascularization and cellular stromal infiltrates. Lesions may progressively enlarge. With chronicity, patches of depigmentation occur. Recurrent episodes of keratoconjunctivitis are common. Both anterior and posterior uveitis are also observed. The former is characterized by photophobia, epiphora, miosis, aqueous flare, iris congestion, and hypotony. The latter is seen funduscopically as hyporeflective areas representing retinal edema. Inflammation around the optic papilla in a butterfly-shaped pattern may be present (see Figure  18 -23) but is often hard to see owing to vitreous and aqueous opacification. Intraocular changes usually occur together with the eyelid lesions, suggesting that the initial invasion is in the eyelids. Intraocular filariae have been reported within the anterior chamber. O. cervicalis has also been implicated as a cause of equine recurrent uveitis.",

Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) is a multifocal, progressive disease of the CNS, most commonly caused by Sarcocystis neurona, although there have been reports of Neospora spp. as a cause. Clinical signs vary with the areas of the CNS affected. Originally the disease was described as causing asymmetric ataxia and associated muscle atrophy; however, involvement of cranial nerves and lesions of the cerebrum has also been reported. Ocular changes, including exposure keratopathy secondary to facial paralysis and decreased tear production, have been reported. Ptosis, enophthalmos, and prominence of the supraorbital process due to muscle denervation atrophy, Horner's syndrome, nystagmus, and blindness have also been reported. Horner's syndrome is a neurologic condition relating to an interruption of the ocular sympathetic pathways. In horses, the signs of Horner's syndrome primarily include ptosis, sweating, and warmth on the denervated side. Other signs seen in small animals with Horner's syndrome, such as miosis and enophthalmos with elevation of the third eyelid, are not prominent in the horse. VIRAL ENCEPHALITIS. The viruses of the Togaviridae family of arboviruses cause encephalitides in horses. The most prominent are members of the alphaviruses, which cause Eastern, Western, and Venezuelan equine encephalitides.

The clinical signs of all of the encephalitides are similar. Fever is often reported early in the disease. Neurologic signs related to diffuse encephalitis-depression, constant walking, head-pressing, constant chewing movements and ataxia-have been reported with Eastern and Western equine encephalitis. Additional signs, such as blindness, circling, excitement, and aggressive behavior, may also develop. As cortical damage worsens, paralysis of larynx, pharynx, and tongue may develop along with loss of brainstem function, leading to head tilt, nystagmus, strabismus, and pupil dilation.
