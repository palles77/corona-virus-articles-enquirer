Sequence analysis of the recombinant junctions of 13 nonsibling intertypic recombinants showed that intertypic RNA recombination is not site-specific, nor does it require extensive homology between the recombining parents at the crossover site. To discriminate between breaking-rejoining and copy choice mechanisms of RNA recombination, we have inhibited the replication of the recombining parents independently and found opposite effects on the frequency of genetic recombination in intratypic crosses. The results strongly support a copy choice mechanism for RNA recombination, in which the viral RNA polymerase switches templates uring negative strand synthesis.",

Replication and transcription of poliovirus RNA are accomplished by a virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Baltimore et al., 1963) . The genomic RNA molecules serve as templates for synthesis of full-length negative strands of RNA; these in turn encode the positive strand RNA molecules of the progeny virus. Cells coinfected with two different temperature sensitive mutants of poliovirus or other picornaviruses release wild-type virus at a low frequency (Hirst, 4962; Ledinko, 1963; Pringle, 1965) , raising the possibility that recombination can occur among RNA genomes, with no involvement of a DNA intermediate. By contrast, RNA Dacteriophage have not been observed to undergo genetc recombination (Horiuchi, 1975) .",

The first, molecular exchange, is similar in concept to the pairing, breaking, and rejoining events in homologous recombination of DNA. The enzymatic and autoc~talytic splicing reactions that generate many eukaryotic messenger RNAs exemplify breaking and joining mechanisms causing RNA rearrangements. The second mechanism, a \"copy choice\" proposal, suggests that the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase, having initiated replication on one viral RNA, could switch templates and continue replication on a second viral RNA molecule. The concept that genetic recombination in DNA g breaking and rejoining of parental DNA molecules is well accepted currently. It is of interest, however, that until 30 years ago most geneticists believed that DNA recombination proceeded by a copy choice mechanism (Belling, 1933; Hershey and Rotman, 1949) . T was dispelled by the discovery that phage lambda nants contain atoms physically derived from bot ts (Meselson and Weigle, 1961) .",

Sequencing of the wild type, 3NC-202guaR, and intertypic recombinant Rlll genomes throughout the regions of the genomes encoding protein 26 was performed by limited chemical degradation (Maxam and Gilbert, 1980) of cDNA made by reverse transcriptase-catalyzed elongation of Y-end-labeled DNA oligonucreotide primers (see Experimental Procedures). One point mutation, changing methionine #187 to a leutine, correlates with the guanidine dependent phenotype. Recent sequencing studies have shown that two other isolates of guanidine dependent poliovirus variants bear two point mutations each, one of which is the same methionine to leucine change at position #187 (Pincus et al., 1986) . For this reason, and because of the low frequency with which goaD mutants are obtained, it is possible that there is another sequence alteration responsible for the uaD phenotype. Extensive sequencing of the region of the genome encoding protein 2C has not revealed such a change; it has been observed previously that determinants of guanidine resistance in some alleles lie outside the 2C region (Pincus et al., 1986) . section and wild-type (guanidine-sensitive) virus coinfect the same cells at high multiplicities of infection, recombination between the two RNA genomes occurs. If the recombination event takes place between the guaD and the temperature sensitive components of the guaR allele, recombinant virus bearing the guaD allele of the 3NC-202guaR parent and 3'sequences from the wild-type parent will be formed ( Figure I ). Having lost both temperature sensitive components of the 3~C-2~2guaR parents, these recombinant viruses will be the only progeny capable of forming plaques at 39% in the presence of guanidine, and thus can be easily selected.",

Yields of various viruses are given as plaque forming units/ml of virus stock; the infected cells were incubated at 32% (permissive conditions for both parental viruses). Recombination frequency is given as the yield of recombinant virus divided by the sum of the yields of the parental viruses. Background resulting from leakage and reversion of the markers can easily be identified phenotypically. For this reason, the numbers of these kinds of plaques, and the predicted \"recombination frequencies\" resulting from this background, are shown in parentheses. HeLa monolayers that were infected with approximately I:100 dilutions of virus stocks I-6 ( from intratypic crosses such as infection 3 (Table 2) are typified by RI11 (Table 1) . Its guanidine dependent phenotype supports the idea that recombination in this cross occurred between the guaD and temperature sensitive components of the guaR allele of 3NC-202guaR ( Figure 1 ). Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of Rlll revealed that it did not contain the GTC (valine) to GCC (alanine) change at amino acid #250 of protein 2C (Table 1) apparently responsible for the temperature sensitive phenotype of the guaR allele. Thus, the calculated recombination frequency of 1.3 x 10e3 recombinants (Table 2) in this cross reflected the frequency of recombination within a region of only 190 nucleotides. This point will be substantiated further by sequence analysis of intertypic recombinants between the same genetic markers. Intertypic crosses were performed by coinfecting cells with 3NC-202guaR virus and wild-type virus of Lansing serotype 2, derived from an infectious cDNA clone constructed by V. Racaniello (1985) . Mahoney type 1 and Lansing type 2 poliovirus genomes share 85% overall homology on the nucleotide level (La Monica et al., 1986) . As in the intratypic cross, an increase in plaque forming units under nonpermissive conditions resulted from mixed infection of the two parental viruses. The ease of detection of both intratypic and intertypic recombinants in this cross was apparent upon inspection of the results of plating virus stocks from Infections l-6 (Table 2) under nonpermissive conditions (Figure 2 ). Although small plaques resulting from spontaneous mutation of the wild-type parental genomes were visible, recombinant progeny could be distinguished clearly in both crosses (Infections 3 and 6) by the larger size of the recombinant plaques as well as their increased frequency. Thus, both intratypic and intertypic recombination could be observed using these genetic markers; the frequency of intratypic recombination was more than 100 times higher than in the intertypic cross.",

The application of this method to the analysis of intertypic recombinants is diagrammed in Figure 3a . The RNA derived from each intertypic recombinant should be completely homologous at its 5' end to the SP6 probes, which were transcribed from plasmids constructed from the Mahoney poliovirus serotype 1 cDNA. In a direction 3' of the crossover junction, recombinant RNA should contain sequences derived from the serotype 2 parent, and should therefore display limited noncomplementarity to the type l-derived probe. The crossover junction could be detected because RNA duplexes with noncomplementary regions as small as one nucleotide pair can be cleaved at the mismatched site by RNAase A (Winter et al., 1985; Because of the method of selection for recombinant% the 5' half of the genome is expected to be derived from the serotype 1, 3NC-202goas parent, and the 3' half of the recombinant should be derived from the wild-type, serotype 2 parent. A uniformly labeled RNA transcrip? complementary to the serotype 1 parent should be protected from RNAase digestion throughout the length of the complementary region (Zinn et al., 1983) ; when the recombinant genome becomes identical with that of its type 2 parent, single base mismatches between the anneaied RNAs are formed that can be cleaved by RNAase A, as indicated by arrows. (b) An autoradiogram of a sequencing gel displays the fragments of labeled RNA that ware protected from RNAase digestion by hybridization with different RNA samples. From left to right, labeled RNA complementary to Mahoney serotype 1 poliovirus RNA from nucleotides 4600 to 4886 was annealed to RNA prepared from mock-, Mahoney serotype 1; and Lansing type 2-infected HeLa cells, and cells infected with 5 isolates of intertypic recombinant viruses. R2 and R3 may have been siblings, as they were progeny of the same mixed infection. The preparation of cytoplasmic RNA and details of the SP6 mapping procedure are described in Experimental Procedures. SP6 RNA analysis of several recombinants is shown in Figure 3b . The SP6 transcript used as a probe in this experiment contained nucleotides complementary to bases 4660 to 4666, in the region of the poliovirus genome encoding protein 2C. No protection of the SP6 probe was provided by RNAs prepared from mock-or type 2-infected HeLa cells, whiie a single protected band was seen with RNA prepared from type l-infected cells. Each of the recombinant RNAs protected a smaller bands, from RNAase digestion. The sizes of these bands established the approximate location of the crossover sites; pairs of bands presumably represent alternative partial cutting sites. The crossover junctions for all 13 intertypic recombinants were located within the sequences represented by the SP6 transcript shown in Figure 3 . SP6 transcripts complementary to genomic regions 5' of these nucleotides (Experimental Procedures) were totally protected by RNA from all 13 recombinants and parental serotype 1 virus; SP6 transcripts complementary to genomic regions 3' of the recombination junctions (Experimental Procedures) were not protected by RNA from any of the 13 recombinants, yielding patterns indistinguishable from the serotype 2 parental viral RNA (data not shown). Thus, each of the 13 recombinants appeared from SP6 mapping to have been generated by a single recombination event.",

The junction between the type 1 and type 2 sequences lay in an 18 base region of homology between the two viral serotypes. Also, it has been reported that the frequencies of intertypic recombination between polioviruses in tissue culture are consistently lower than the frequencies of recombination between two viruses of the same serotype, albeit using different genetic markers (Tolskaya et al., 1983; McCahon et al., 1975) .

The lower frequency of intertypic recombination could possibly reflect a lack of viability of many intertypic recombinants. Throughout the 190 nucleotides in which the crossover events occur, only 3 of the 39 nucleotide changes between serotypes 1 and 2 predict amino acid changes in protein 2C. Nevertheless, the plaque phenotypes of the 13 intertypic recombinants, while all relatively guanidine-dependent and temperature-insensitive, vary significantly and unpredictably. It is possible that single nucleotide changes in other regions of the genome, not evident from the SP6 probe analysis perhaps because they are in the type 2 region, may have improved the otherwise poor viability of the intertypic recombinants, modifying their phenotype. A requirement for such nucleotide changes would explain a much lower frequency of intertypic recombination in this region. Nonetheless, it is also likely that the lower intertypic recombination frequency reflects some preference for homology between recombining parents for recombination to occur. No addition or deletion of bases was seen for any of the intertypic recombinant& arguing, perhaps, that there is some alignment of the parental molecules. It is clear from Figure 4 that identity between the two parental RNA molecules immediately at the crossover junction does not seem to be necessary for RNA recombination. Thus, if there is a role for overall homology between the two parental genomes, it may result from a need for a general alignment of the parental molecules or for stabilization of some structure targer than that immediately at the crossover site.",

Coinfection of wild-type guanidine sensitive virus with virus bearing the guanidine resistance allele used in this study does not alleviate this inhibition (unpublished results, Table 3 ). Thus, the replication of the 3NC-2U2guaR temperature sensitive parental virus and the wild-type guanidine sensitive parental virus could be inhibited independently of each other in recombinant crosses, and the effect on the frequency of recombination could be determined. Different models of the mechanism of RNA recombination predict different outcomes for this experiment, as diagrammed in Figure 5 . If RNA recombination occurs by a breaking and joining mechanism, it is difficult to predict whether ongoing replication would be required or not. One can assume, however, that the requirements for the two recombining parents would be symmetrical. For example, if only the physical presence and not the replication of the 3NC-202guaR parental RNA were necessary for it to be a substrate for breaking and rejoining enzymes, it is difficult to imagine why the wi~d~ty~e parental RNA would have to be replicating to provide a substrate for the same enzymes. Thus, the prediction of a breaking and rejoining model of RNA recombination is that inhibiting the replication of the 3NC-202guaR virus with high temperature and inhibiting the replication of the wild-type virus with guanidine should have the same effect on the frequency of RNA recombination.

Infections 1 to 3 were identical with those shown in Table 2 , but with shorter incubation times. Infection 3 was a simple coinfection of wild-type 1 and 3NC-202guaR viruses; recombinants arose at a frequency of 1.8 x 10-4. Infection 6, on the other hand, was a coinfection in which wild-type virus was allowed to grow and replicate in the presence of a large pool of nonreplicating 3NC-202guaR virus. This was accomplished by first infecting HeLa cells with 3NC-202guaR virus for 4 hr under permissive conditions, shifting to 39% for 30 min to inhibit 3NC-202guaR replication, superinfecting with wild-type virus at 39%, and allowing the wild-type virus to grow at 39% for 2.5 hr in the presence of the nonreplicating 3NC-202guaR virus. As can be seen from Infection 6 in Table 3 , and control Infections 4 and 5, this protocol yielded comparable titers of both parental viruses.

Experiments designed to show that guanidine does not inhibit recombination, involving crosses between wild-type virus and a virus with a temperature sensitive marker 5' of the guanidine resistance locus, have been difficult because of the lack of availability of a characterized mutant with a sufficiently low reversion rate in the 5' half of the poliovirus genome.

Thus, these data suggest that RNA recombination in poliovirus results from a template switch made by the viral polymerase during negative strand synthesis. The sequences of intertypic recombinants (Figure 4) suggested that RNA recombination is not particularly site-specific. Thus, the apparent preference of the polioviral replicase to switch templates during negative strand rather than positive strand synthesis presumably results from different structures or availabilities of the templates for negative and positive strand synthesis during viral replication. Support for this idea comes from the finding that most recombination events between foot-and-mouth disease mutants occur very early in the infectious cycle (McCahon and Slade, 1981) . Genetic recombination on the RNA level has been demonstrated in a murine coronavirus (Makino et al., 1986) and in a multipartite plant virus (Bujarski and Kaesberg, 1986) , as well as in picornaviruses. Possibly related RNA rearrangements include the generation of defective interfering particles in positive and negative strand RNA viruses, the fusing of noncontiguous RNA sequences during coronavirus transcription (Baric et al., 1985) and the duplication of small segments of RNA in viroids (Keese and Symons, 1985) . Copy choice, or \"polymerase jumping\" mechanisms, have been invoked to explain many of these phenomena. There are, however, only a few experimental indications to support this view. The most compelling of these indications comes from coronaviruses; UV mapping and pulse-chase experiments have suggested that coronavirus transcripts, most of which display specific internal deletions relative to the viral genome, do not originate from larger precursors, but instead are transcribed in a discontinuous manner (Jacobs et al., 1981; Stern and Sefton, 1982; Baric et al., 1985) . That template switching of the polioviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is apparently responsible for RNA recombination in poliovirus strengthens the idea that other RNA rearrangements may occur by this mechanism as well, and it revives copy choice as a viable mechanism for some kinds of genetic rearrangements.",

One isolate, 3NC 202guaR, showed good growth characteristics (relatively large plaques and a low level of reversion during plaque assay) in the presence and absence of 0.5 mM guanidine.

(1983) , under the following conditions: cytoplasmic RNA from mock-infected or poliovirus-infected cells was hybridized with 32P-labeled SP6 transcripts at 60\u00b0C: the RNAase A-and RNAase T&containing buffer was 100 mM in NaCI, and the RNA hybrids were treated with the RNAase solution for IO min at 15%. These digestion conditions appear to optimize the recognition of single base mismatches by RNAase A (data not shown; R. Myers, personal communication). Individual SP6 transcripts complementary to nucleotides 3581 to 4886, 4886 to 6304, 8304 to 7387, and 4600 to 4886 of the Mahoney type 1 poliovirus genome were used to analyze the recombinant genomes. The crossover sites of the intertypic recombinants were sequenced by dideoxynucleotide chain termination (Sanger et al., 1977) essentially as described by Emini et al. (1984) , except that the reverse transcriptase (BRL) reactions were terminated by the addition of 150 ul of a solution containing 1.5 M ammonium acetate, 10 Kg/ml of tRNA, and 0.5 ml of ethanol. The solutions were then frozen; the RNA was collected by centrifugation and rinsed with cold 80% ethanol before being loaded on a sequencing gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was visualized by autoradiography without further treatment. The primers for dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the 13 recombinants were synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides CACATTTCAGTTGCC, complementary to nucleotides 4912 through 4926, and GTTGAGGCCAAAACG, complementary to nucleotides 4772 through 4785 of the Lansing type 2 poliovirus genome (La Monica et al., 1986) .",
