EDC proved to provide good yields of the analogs from the respective \u03c9-amino-1-or -2-hydroxyalkylphosphonates and nucleobase-derived acetic acids. New phosphorus-nucleobase linkers are characterized by two fragments of the restricted rotation within amide bonds and in four-atom units (P-CH(OH)-CH 2 -N, P-CH(OH)-CH 2 -C and P-CH 2 -CH(OH)-C) in which antiperiplanar disposition of P and N/C atoms was deduced from 1 H and 13 C NMR spectral data. The synthesized analogs P-X-HNC(O)-CH 2 B [X=CH(OH)CH 2 , CH(OH)CH 2 CH 2 , CH 2 CH(OH)CH 2 ] appeared inactive in antiviral assays on a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM, while two phosphonates showed cytostatic activity towards myeloid leukemia (K-562) and multiple myeloma cells (MM.1S) with IC 50 of 28.8 and 40.7 \u03bcM, respectively.

This was inspired by the successful application of the isosteric replacement of this bond by a methylene ether [-CH 2 -O] moiety in studies on the biological activity of natural peptides [6] [7] [8] . However, the introduction of the amide [P-CH 2 -HN-C(O)-] residue significantly increases donor-acceptor interactions within a new linker. It also modifies its conformational flexibility due to the restricted rotation around the amide bond. In our first approach [5] , four series of the phosphonate amides of general formulae 5 and 6 were synthesized (Fig. 2) .",

Hence, we reasoned that installation of additional polar functionalities in the aliphatic linker could improve acyclic nucleoside-enzyme interactions, and thus significantly increase the activity. Herein, we wish to describe our studies on the synthesis and the biological activity of the new amides 7-9 having the hydroxy groups within the aliphatic linker. To synthesize the final acyclic nucleoside phosphonates 7-9, the approach involving the formation of the amide bond between the respective acetic acid derivatives 13a-13h and \u03c9-aminophosphonates 10-12 was followed (Scheme 1) [5] .",

The phosphonate 10 is a known compound [15, 16] and it was prepared by the ammonolysis of diethyl 1,2-epoxyethanephosphonate 14, but the authors failed to provide a full characterization of the material they obtained. The phosphonate 12 is also known [15] and it was obtained in a similar manner from diethyl 2,3-epoxypropanephosphonate 15, though the authors were unable to prove the purity of the product. Our experience with the 2,3-epoxypropanephosphonate framework [17] assured us that phosphonates 10 and 12 of the highest purity could be obtained from the epoxides 14 and 15, respectively, when dibenzylamine will be applied instead of ammonia followed by hydrogenolysis (Scheme 2) [18] .",

Since 1 H NMR spectra of all nucleotide analogs 7a-7h exhibited almost identical patterns regarding a P-CH(OH)-CH 2 -NHC(O)-CH 2 fragment, we concluded that in a methanolic solution they exist in the same conformation. Detailed analysis of a 1 H NMR spectrum of 7d, including a 1 H{ 31 P} one, clearly revealed an antiperiplanar disposition of the phosphoryl and amide groups projected as 18 (Fig. 4) . Vicinal couplings H1-H2a (3.6 Hz) and H1-H2b (9.2 Hz) fit well into the ranges expected for the gauche and antiperiplanar arrangement of these protons [30] . Furthermore, values of both 3 J(P-H2a/H2b) coupling constants are close (7.2 and 8.5 Hz). These values were well correlated with those characteristic of the gauche hydrogen-phosphorus relationship [31, 32] . The stability of the conformation 18 primarily results from the steric bulkiness of the substituents at C1 and C2 but may also be enforced by a C2-N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(H)-C1 hydrogen bond within a five-membered ring as depicted in 19 (Fig. 4) . This suggestion finds support in a large downfield shift of the H2a proton (3.73 ppm) as compared with the H2b proton (3.38 ppm) which can only be observed when an amide C=O acts as a deshielding group. This is only possible when a C2-N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(H)-C1 hydrogen bond is strong enough to enable a free rotation around a C2-NH bond.",

The coupling of the respective \u03c9-aminophosphonates and nucleobase-derived acetic acids was accomplished in good yields by application of EDC. Phosphonate-nucleobase linkers in the synthesized analogs contain two fragments of restricted rotation, namely the amide bonds and P-CH(OH)-CH 2 -N (compounds 7a-7h), P-CH(OH)-CH 2 -C (compounds 8a-8h), and P-CH 2 -CH(OH)-C (compounds 9a-9h) residues in which, as judged from 1 H and 13 C NMR spectral data, antiperiplanar disposition of P and N/C atoms results both from the steric bulkiness of O,O-diethyl phosphoryl group and intramolecular H-bonding.

Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required reducing virus-induced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. Cytotoxicity of the test compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology.",
