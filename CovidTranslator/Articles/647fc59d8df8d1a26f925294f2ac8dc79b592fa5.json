            "text": "The introduction of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAT) has significantly improved the diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) [13, 20] . The time-to-result has decreased considerably, allowing timely patient management and infection control. In addition, the availability of NAT can reduce costs in selected situations and possibly reduce antibiotic usage in the case of viral infection [21] . Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in particular demonstrated its usefulness and reliability not only during the 2009 influenza pandemic [14, 26] . However, the increasing number of respiratory pathogens to diagnose puts a tremendous challenge on NAT methodology. In recent years, new molecular technologies have fostered the shift from single-pathogen detection to a multiplex approach to simultaneously detect a range of respiratory agents [24] . Indeed, it has been shown that real-time PCR can be performed in a multiplex fashion, but the multiplexing of real-time PCR assays can have a detrimental influence on sensitivity due to complex primer/ probe interactions. As an alternative, suspension microarray assays on Luminex platforms allow multiple target detection in a single reaction tube [1, 25] . Importantly, most currently available assays include either viral or bacterial targets only, rendering a combination hereof an attractive option for laboratories. Since viral and bacterial infections are often indistinguishable on clinical grounds, definite aetiological diagnosis retains the utmost importance for optimal patient care. In addition, complex interactions between viral and bacterial co-infections have been demonstrated, but there is little information on the clinical relevance of this finding [4] . To streamline diagnostics and to elucidate the possible relevance of viral/bacterial co-infections, including bacterial targets is, therefore, highly desirable. In particular, atypical bacteria represent reasonable targets, since they are refractory to standard culture techniques and are non-colonising bacteria. Within a network of academic as well as industry partners (Qiagen), we have, therefore, developed a novel multiplex PCR using suspension microarray technology for the combined detection of viral as well as atypical bacterial targets (SYMP-ARI study). Previous studies have shown that multiplex suspension microarrays outperform traditional techniques, e.g. direct immunofluorescene or virus culture [1, 20] . However, in most studies, a combination of different diagnostic methods has been used as the reference and not all were of prospective nature. The aim of this study was to evaluate a new microarray assay for 23 pathogens in comparison to individual real-time PCR. The real-time PCR assays were optimised to reach ultimate sensitivity and reduce hands-on time. In a first step, both methods have been validated on a panel of known positive archived samples. Hereafter, both assays were deployed on prospectively collected samples including children and adults to assess assay performance.",

Cycling was done on a GeneAmp 9700 cycler (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) with the following protocol: 50\u00b0C for 35 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 15 cycles of enrichment cycling (94\u00b0C for 30 s, 52\u00b0C for 90 s, 72\u00b0C for 60 s), 10 cycles of two-step cycling (94\u00b0C for 15 s and 70\u00b0C for 90 s) and three-step cycling (94\u00b0C for 25 s, 52\u00b0C for 15 s, 72\u00b0C for 15 s). A final extension step was done at 72\u00b0C for 3 min. After the cycling protocol, 5 \u03bcl of RT-PCR product, 10 \u03bcL of SYMP-ARI bead mix and 35 \u03bcL of detection buffer were incubated at 52\u00b0C for 10 min. Subsequently, 7.5 \u03bcl of streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate mixed with 7.5 \u03bcl detection buffer was added to each reaction well. Hereafter, the reaction was incubated at 52\u00b0C for 5 min. To terminate the reaction, 180 \u03bcL of stopping buffer was added to each well. Detection was performed in a 96-well plate format on the Luminex 100 machine (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., Toronto, Canada) using Luminex 100 IS software (Luminex). The median fluorescent intensity (MFI) was determined and MFI values above a threshold level of 150 were regarded as positive.

From a technical standpoint, the incorporation of 19 viral and four bacterial targets into a single multiplex assay was successful, as demonstrated on a panel of previously characterised samples. To fully appreciate the role of viruses in ARI, we decided to include 19 viruses which have currently been associated with ARI. Including such a broad range of pathogens into one assay further provides the opportunity to study the relevance of multiple infections and possible interactions between ARI pathogens. A recent study points to the clinical relevance of this issue [4] . We further decided to include the atypical bacteria Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila into the panel, since these are non-colonising bacteria, hard to cultivate and, thus, provide a valuable target for molecular assays. Previous studies have already demonstrated the feasibility of NAT to detect atypical bacteria in formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded specimens [2] . As infections with Mycoplasma pneumoniae were associated with severe illness in a cohort of children, its testing might also be of value for risk assessment [3] . Interestingly, Brunstein et al. reported on the infectivity-enhancing activity of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae [4] . Since the combination of influenza and concurrent infection with S. pneumoniae can worsen outcome, the inclusion of S. pneumoniae into the panel might be a future option [22] . However, asymptomatic colonisation with S. pneumoniae does occur and may limit the validity of positive PCR results. In general, molecular detection methods for the rapid identification of ARI pathogens outperformed classical methods in numerous studies [12, 30, 31] . Therefore, we did not include classical methods like direct fluorescence antigen (DFA) detection and virus isolation into our test algorithm. Instead, a panel of published and optimised monoplex PCR assays was used for comparison. Use of individual real-time PCR assays also allowed a reliable estimation of the relative target gene concentration.",

A low number of positive samples certainly limits the validity for some targets, requiring larger studies in order to reliably assess sensitivity and specificity. Similar to Gadsby et al., we found that the most discrepant results were associated with Ct-values >35. This was seen for viral as well as for bacterial targets. Of note, with the exception of rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus 1 and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, this finding is most likely not associated with sequence mismatches between the primers and the target, but, rather, with low target gene concentrations.

In our study, the sensitivity of the adenovirus assay was rather good, with Rhinovirus \u2212 a value of 90 %. It is unlikely that only one type was detected, since specimens were prospectively collected over a 6-month period at different study sites. Still, without further sequencing, it remains unclear as to which adenovirus serotypes were prevalent in our study. Importantly, adults especially may benefit from highly sensitive molecular methods, since they shed ARI pathogens in lower multiplicity than children. However, for the adult cohort, the observed detection rates in this study are slightly lower than those reported by Pabbaraju et al. [25] . It remains speculative whether this finding might be attributable, in part, to the different sample types used. In light of the lower detection rates in adult patients, application of the novel microarray assay might be restricted to younger patients.

Critically, the number of samples was not adequate for some of the targets, thus, limiting the validity of our results. Nevertheless, a number of bacterial infections were detected by both methods in this study. These may valuably guide the clinician's decision to initiate specific treatment. Of note, Legionella pneumophila remained undetectable in this study. It cannot be ruled out that pharyngeal specimens are not the optimal specimen type, and the use of sputum might provide better results. For better standardisation, however, we decided to collect only one specimen type per patient in our study.",

Here, each positive result above the threshold of the PCR reaction was communicated to the clinicians. A recent study by Rand et al. [28] demonstrated 15.9 % mixed infections in a cohort of 200 patients. We observed multiple infections at a slightly lower prevalence of 11.6 and 8.7 %, respectively. However, the clinical significance of dual or triple infections remains unclear to date. Interestingly, RNA viruses were frequently associated with multiple infections, whereas the viral/bacterial combination has rarely been seen. Of note, real-time PCR was significantly more sensitive in the detection of multiple infections, whereas the multiplex assay frequently missed the second pathogen. In most instances, this was due to low target gene concentrations, as indicated by Ct-values above 35 in the monoplex PCR.",

[11] . In their study, symptomatic patients displayed significantly higher pathogen concentrations than asymptomatic controls. Moreover, it is suggestive that, e.g. the length of therapy could be based on quantitative data. However, the correlation of MFI values with target gene concentrations has not been firmly assessed for multiplex bead-based assays. Another issue of concern is the sampling of respiratory specimens, which is far from being standardised [19] . The optimal specimen type needs to be determined (and might vary between different agents) and more data on the clinical relevance of virus detection in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens are desirable.",

However, the most common pathogens all yielded kappa values >0.67 (95 % CI 0.55-0.78), indicating substantial (rhinovirus, HMPV and human bocavirus) to almost perfect agreement (RSV-A, RSV-B). An analysis on the patient sample level yielded concordant results for 230/ 300 [77 % (95 % CI 72-81 %)] samples. In the 70 samples with discrepant results, 14/70 (20 %) showed a false-positive deviation, 49/70 (70 %) a false-negative deviation and 7/70 (10 %) in both directions. Discrepant results included a broad variety of pathogens. The most discrepant results were observed for rhinovirus, with a total of 24 (12 false-negative, 12 false-positive results), followed by RSV-B with ten (nine false-negative, one false-positive results), HMPV with nine (eight falsenegative, one false-positive results) and human bocavirus with nine discrepant results (nine false-negative results), respectively. Interestingly, for false-negative samples, significantly lower target gene concentrations as indicated by higher Ct-values were recorded for bocavirus, HMPV and RSV-B, but not for parainfluenza virus 1, rhinovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae(Table 3). To further analyse the rhinovirus discrepant results, we sequenced the VP1 gene of nine of the monoplex-positive/multiplex-negative and eight of the monoplex-negative/multiplex-positive samples. A total of 12/17 (71 %) samples comprised the novel rhinovirus type C, as demonstrated by sequence analysis (data not shown). In the monoplex-positive/multiplexnegative group, 6/9 samples yielded the novel rhinovirus C, whereas in the monoplex-negative/multiplex-positive group, 6/8 samples were positive for rhinovirus C, respectively. Of note, three rhinovirus-positive samples with concordant results (monoplex PCR-positive and multiplex PCR-positive) concomitantly yielded a false-positive enterovirus signal in the multiplex PCR. However, the corresponding enterovirus MFI value in each of the samples was lower than the rhinovirus MFI value, indicating a possible cross-reactivity of the enterovirus assay.Finally, a comparison on the patient sample level of samples with multiple detections showed that only 12/35 (34 %) samples yielded concordant results (11 with dual infection, one with triple infection). To further analyse these samples, the Ct-values of monoplex PCR-positive samples with dual detections were compared with respect to concordant and discordant multiplex results. Pathogens were",

The mean and median age of all patients was 31 and 12.5 years, respectively. Adults contributed 146/300 (49 %) samples and paediatric patients contributed 154/ 300 (51 %) samples. Of the adult patients, 140/146 (96 %) were immunocompetent, whereas 6/146 (4 %) were immunocompromised. Of the paediatric patients, 149/154 (97 %) were immunocompetent and 5/154 (3 %) were immunocompromised. The collection of samples comprised 112 nasopharyngeal aspirates and 188 pharyngeal swabs. For 290 samples, exact information on the time of symptom onset and sampling was available. The median time between the onset of acute respiratory symptoms and sampling was 4 days [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3.9-5.1 days]. Gold standard monoplex PCR Monoplex PCR detected \u22651 pathogen in 165/300 (55 %) samples. Single infections were observed in 130/300 (43 %) samples. As expected, the positivity rate was significantly higher in paediatric patients [126/154, (82 %)] compared to adults [39/146, (27 %)] (Fisher's exact test, p<0.0001). Of note, the time between symptom onset and sampling was not different between monoplex PCR-positive and -negative samples (Mann-Whitney U-test, p>0.05). The most frequently identifiable pathogen was rhinovirus, with 42/300 (14 %) detections, followed by RSV-B with 36/300 (12 %) and HMPV, with 27/300 (9 %) detections. The least detectable pathogens were enterovirus, with 3/300 (1 %), Legionella pneumophila, with 2/300 (0.6 %), and parainfluenza virus 4 and coronavirus NL63, with 1/300 (0.3 %) detections, respectively. Seasonal influenza viruses A/ H1N1 and A/H3N2, influenza virus B and Bordetella pertussis were not detectable within this study group. In 17/300 (5.6 %) samples, a bacterial pathogen was identified, with Mycoplasma pneumoniae being the most frequent [11/300 (3.7 %)] (Table 2). Multiple detections (\u22652 pathogens) occurred in 35/300 (11.6 %) of samples, almost exclusively in paediatric patients (median age 1 year; 95 % CI 0.8-3.6 years), with the exception of one 19-year-old study subject. Two specimens harboured five and six different pathogens, respectively. However, the majority [29/35 (83 %)] of multiplepositive samples were dual infections (Table 4). Rhinovirus was the co-pathogen most frequently detected (16/35), followed by human bocavirus (14/35) and RSV-B (10/35). Parainfluenza virus 4, CoV NL63, Bordetella pertussis and Legionella pneumophila were not involved in multiple infections. Finally, the MS2 phage, which served as an internal control, was detected in 300/300 (100 %) samples, indicating the robustness of the assay. Novel multiplex PCR Overall, multiplex PCR yielded positive results in 140/300 (46 %) samples. As experienced with monoplex PCR, significantly more samples were positive in paediatric patients [114/154, (74 %)] compared to adults [26/146, (18 %)] (Fisher's exact test, p<0.0001). The most frequently detectable pathogen by multiplex PCR was rhinovirus [42The least detectable pathogens were parainfluenza virus 4, coronavirus OC43 and Chlamydia pneumoniae, with a single detection (0.3 %), respectively. Seasonal influenza viruses A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 and influenza virus B, coronavirus NL63, Bordetella pertussis and Legionella pneumophila were not found. Notably, this version of the multiplex assay was not designed to type pandemic influenza virus A/H1N1 (2009). Instead, the detection of pandemic influenza virus A/H1N1 (2009) was achieved by exclusion criteria (positive result for universal influenza virus A and concomitantly negative for seasonal A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and A/H5N1). Hence, 6/300 (2 %) samples that were positive for universal influenza virus A but negative for seasonal influenza virus A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 indicated the presence of pandemic A/H1N1 (2009). This finding was confirmed upon the use of an A/H1N1 (2009)-specific real-time PCR.",
