Inhibition only occurred when NH4C1 was present during the first 2 h after infection. Syncytium formation was studied during replication of IBV-Beaudette in Vero cells. Some cell-ceU fusion occurred at pH 7.0 and pH 6.5 but it was optimal at pH 6.7. IBV strain UK/123/82 did not replicate in Vero cells and was studied in CK cells in which it grew well but without forming syncytia. In contrast to IBV-Beaudette, NH4C1 had virtually no effect on the replication of UK/123/82. The results show that the IBV spike glycoprotein induces membrane fusion at near neutral pH although some IBV strains may require a mildly acidic environment for the efficient uncoating of the virion RNA.",

In IBV and some other coronaviruses the S protein is cleaved to form an amino-terminal S 1 and a carboxy-terminal $2 subunit [ 1, 22] . A subset of the coronaviruses, which includes bovine coronavirus (BCV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) but not avian IBV, contains a third glycoprotein (HE) which has haemagglutinating and acetyl-esterase activities [22] . The ribonu-308 D. Li and D. Cavanagh cleoprotein (RNP) comprises a single, positive-sense RNA molecule of some 30,000 nucleotides surrounded by a phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N) [22] .",

Host cells infected with either virus fused to form syncytia when the culture medium was at pH 7.5 or greater but not at pH 7.0 or less [6, 8, 21] . These results indicated that the membrane fusing activity of the spike glycoprotein (S) did not require triggering in an acidic environment, in contrast to orthomyxoviruses, togaviruses and flaviviruses [8, 9, 10, 12] . Moreover, the results suggested that release of the RNP might occur following fusion of the virion envelope with the cell surface (plasmalemma) which can occur with paramyxoviruses [12, 16] and many mammalian retroviruses [14] .

To assess whether NH4C1 would have any effect on the replication of IBV-Beaudette, Vero and CK cells were preincubated with 0, 5, or 10 mM NH4C1 at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Both cell types were then inoculated with the same dilution To determine if NH4C1 would affect the attachment of virus to cells, Vero cells were held at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min with virus in the presence of 30 mM NH4Ct to permit attachment but not entry of the virus into the cells. The cells were then washed and incubation continued in the absence of NH4C1 at 37 \u00b0C for 13 h after which time the cells were fixed and examined using fluorescent antibody. The number of groups of infected cells (45) following attachment in the presence of NH4C1 was virtually the same as without NH4C1 (51); the total number of cells was 164 and 175, respectively. Thus NH4CI had not decreased the attachment of the virus to cells.",

            "text": "Further experiments were performed to determine whether NH4C1 exerted its affect on IBV-Beaudette at an early, but post-attachment, or late stage in the infection cycle. In one experiment Vero cells were infected with IBV-Beaudette (m.o.i. 0.03) and incubated for a total of 14h with NH4C1 present or absent as shown in Table 2 , experiment 1. The cells were then fixed and the infected cells detected using fluorescent antibody. Table 2 shows that the presence of NH4C1 before infection and from 2 to 4 h after infection had no effect on the number of groups of cells which had produced virus proteins. In contrast, the presence of NH4C1 during the first two hours of infection reduced the number of cells successfully infected by the inoculum by approximately 95%. The intensity of fluorescence of successfully infected cells was similar, irrespective of when NH4C1 had been present. A second experiment (Table2) confirmed the results of experiment 1, NH4C1 having reduced the number of groups of infected cells by approximately 80% when present during the first 2 h of infection. In both experiments, for groups 1-4, the total number of infected cells was 3-to 6-fold greater than the number of cells which had been infected by the inoculum. This showed that following removal of NH4C1 replication had proceeded normally. In the second experiment ( Table 2 ) one group of cell cultures (group 5) had NH4C1 present from 2 h until 14 h. In this case the number of cells productively infected by 14h was virtually the same as the number of cells infected by the inoculum, i.e., the continued presence of the NH4C1 had inhibited the second cycle of infection. The results showed that NH4C1 had affected an early stage in the replication cycle. The replication of IBV UK/123/82 was studied in CK cells as this strain did not replicate in Veto cells. UK/123/83 did not induce syncytium formation. CK cells were pre-treated with NH4C1, at either 10 mM or 30 mM, for 30 min and then infected with either UK/123/82 or Beaudette at a moi of 0.1 CDs0/ml and 0.3 pfu/ml, respectively, in the presence or absence of the relevant concentration of drug. After 1 h the inoculum was replaced and the incubation continued with NH4C1 present for the periods indicated in Table 3 . At the end of the experiment the medium was harvested for virus titration. Table 3 shows that whereas 10 mM and 30 mM NH4C1 resulted in a 100-and 10-fold decrease, respectively, in the titre of IBV-Beaudette, there was no effect on UK/123/82. The effect of NH4C1 on the first cycle of replication of UK/123/82 was further studied by immuofluorescence, the drug (30mM) being present for 30 min before infection and for the first 2 h after infection. The CK cells had been grown on coverslips and were fixed at 10 h after infection. The results in Table 4 show that the drug decreased the number of cells productively infected with IBV-Beaudette by 78% whereas there was only a 13% decrease in the case of UK/123/82.",

Secondly, the fusion of virion envelopes with cell membranes, as examined by raising the pH within endosomes with NH4C1. Although the pH conditions optimal for these two processes need not be the same, our observations on syncytium formation in Vero cells and the lack of an inhibitory effect of NH4C1 on UK/123/82 replication in CK cells lead to the same conclusion, namely that the S protein of IBV is fusogenically active at around neutral pH. NH4C1 can raise the pH of endosomes to almost pH 7.0 [24] . The finding that NH4C1 only partially inhibited the replication of IBV is in keeping with our finding that Beaudette-induced syncytium formation did occur at pH7.0 but was less extensive than at pH 6.7 (Fig. 1) . The increased endosomal pH may have resulted in a reduction in the rate of membrane fusion such that some virions were transferred to and destroyed in lysosomes. The failure of NH4C1 to inhibit replication of IBV UK/123/82 shows that fusion of this virus with cell membranes, leading to genome uncoating, occurred at about pH 7.0.",

Fusion of BCV virions (Mebus strain L9) with the plasmalemma, but not endosomal membranes, of HRT-18 cells has been observed by electronmicroscopy [19] . In addition NH4C1 only reduced the output of BCV to a small degree (35%), leading to the conclusion that BCV genome uncoating did not require acid pH and that it occurred at the cell surface. Electron microscopic analysis of the entry of IBV-Beaudette into chicken chorioaltantoic membrane cells and CK cells showed entry by phagocytosis and micropinocytosis [-2, 17] . There was no evidence for fusion of IBV-Beaudette at the plasmalemma although fusion within vesicles was not observed either. Whether fusion occurs at the cell surface or within a vesicle, even with a virus for which an acidic environment is not required, will depend on the rate of fusion relative to the speed of endocytosis [13] .",
