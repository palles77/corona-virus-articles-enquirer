The diseases are feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), in which the virus is widely disseminated, and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), a mild disease in which the virus is usually limited to the villi. These two viruses were found to differ in their growth in cell culture. FIPV grows to higher titer, forms larger plaques and switches offhost cell protein synthesis more effectively than FECV. Cross neutralization studies showed antigenic differences between the strains. There also appeared to be a difference in the nucleoprotein molecular weight of the viruses causing these two different disease syndromes.",

The first is known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), and is characterized by peritonitis and/or pleuritis with occasional central nervous system and ocular involvement (7) . The inflammatory infiltrate consists of lymphoeytes, plasma cells, and macrophages resulting in either nonsuppurative or a granulomatous inflammarion. The second disease is caused by feline enteric eoronavirus (FECV) and is a subclinical or mild enteric infection in which, lesions are located in the upper third of the villi of the small intestine (16) . Although these viruses are associated with very different disease syndromes, evidence has suggested that the viruses are antigenicMly and biologieMly similar (12) . It was reported that both virus strains produce relatively large plaques in cell culture and grew to fairly high titers (1) . In addition, their polypeptides appeared to be the same molecular weight by immunoblotting (1) . Although the strains eausing peritonitis and enteritis in eats were antigenieally and biologicMly similar; neither protected against infection with the other (17) . Therefore, we investigated the antigenic biological and biochemical properties of these viruses in more detail.",

The neutralizing titers for FIPV 79-I146 and NOR 15 were similar irrespective of the antiserum used. By comparison, the FECV 79-1683 strain had a 32 fold difference in neutralization titer using antisera against 79-1146 and a 8 fold difference when antisera against 79-1683 was used. These results suggest that 79-1146 and NOI~ 15 strains are antigenically similar by virus neutralization and are distinct from the 79-1683 strain of feline eoronavirus. ",

The low level of cross reactivity with heterologous serum compared to homologous serum suggests considerable antigenic variation between the two groups. However the sera were not very high titer despite immunization of rabbits with biologieMly cloned purified virus, perhaps due to the fragility of the peplomer protein which induces neutralizing antibody (6) . No differences were seen in the molecular weights of the peplomer but this might be undetectable in such a high molecular weight protein where the relevant epitope may be only a very small part of the entity. Previous studies with convalescent sera from naturally and experimentally infected cats did not show these differences in vitro (16, 17) but did in vivo where FIPV strains did not protect against FECV infection and prior FECV infection even seemed to enhance the pathogenicity of FIPV.",

The FECV strain did not switch off host cell synthesis even in the presence of aetinomyein D. Host cell protein synthesis was also shut offby infection with murine coronavirus and different strains vary in the extent to which they do it, (25) . Highly lyric strains of MCV synthesize M1 3 structurM polypeptides synchronously whereas the nucleoprotein appears earlier than the other two polypeptides in less lytic infections (19, 23) . In this study, all 3 st, ruetural polypeptides appeared synchronously in cells infected with FIPV or FECV strains. It is interesting that the more vigorously growing strains which produce more varied and severe disease (FIPV) shut off host cell synthesis more effectively than the less pathogenic FECV strain. Despite the aforementioned differences, there is currently no evidence that the in vitro differences between the virus strains studied are associated with or linked to the differences in the pathogenicity of FIPV and FECV strains in vivo.",
