            "text": "The pathogenesis of infectious diarrheal diseases is largely attributed to enterotoxin proteins that disrupt intestinal water absorption, causing severe dehydration. Despite profound health consequences, the impacts of diarrhea-causing microbes on the evolutionary history of host species are largely unknown. We investigated patterns of genetic variation in mammalian Guanylate Cyclase-C (GC-C), an intestinal receptor frequently targeted by bacterial enterotoxins, to determine how hosts might adapt in response to diarrheal infections. Under normal conditions, GC-C interacts with endogenous guanylin peptides to promote water secretion in the intestine, but signaling can be hijacked by bacterially-encoded heat-stable enterotoxins (STa) during infection, which leads to overstimulation of GC-C and diarrhea. Phylogenetic analysis in mammals revealed evidence of recurrent positive selection in the GC-C ligand-binding domain in primates and bats, consistent with selective pressures to evade interactions with STa. Using in vitro assays and transgenic intestinal organoids to model STa-mediated diarrhea, we show that GC-C diversification in these lineages results in substantial variation in toxin susceptibility. In bats, we observe a unique pattern of compensatory coevolution in the endogenous GC-C ligand uroguanylin, reflecting intense bouts of positive selection at the receptor-ligand interface. These findings demonstrate control of water physiology as a previously unrecognized interface for genetic conflict and reveal diarrheal pathogens as a source of selective pressure among diverse mammals.",

Using statistical models that compare ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations (dN/dS) across species 5,6 , we find strong evidence of recurrent positive selection in GC-C (Table S2 ). Similar patterns of abundant nonsynonymous substitutions are widely reported for genes encoding dedicated immune functions that are targeted by pathogen factors 7 . This suggests that GC-C may similarly be subject to recurrent selection based on temporary advantages conferred by mitigating pathogen interactions. Unlike dedicated immune proteins, however, GC-C is functionally constrained by its physiological function of regulating water secretion through interactions with endogenous ligands. Indeed, the GC-C signaling axis is found in all vertebrates 8 , a pattern associated with functional conservation. To better understand the role of toxin interactions in GC-C evolution, we compared sequence evolution in the paralogous natriuretic peptide receptors (NPR1-2), which share similar overall structure and function with GC-C. NPR1 and NPR2 are not known to interact with pathogen-derived toxins 9 , and in contrast to GC-C, bear signatures of purifying selection with highly conserved sequences across primates (Tables S1,S2). Rapid evolution of GC-C is therefore associated with its unique interaction with pathogens.",

These commonly include toxin variants STp and STh encoded by strains of Enterotoxigenic E. coli 10 . Pathogenic strains from other bacterial genera, including Yersinia and Vibrio species, also encode distinct STa variants 11, 12 . These peptides show considerable sequence variation in contrast to the endogenous GC-C ligands guanylin and uroguanylin that are nearly identical among primates ( Figure 1A , S1). To further examine how GC-C evolution in primates might be influenced by toxin interactions, we mapped rapidly evolving codons with significantly elevated dN/dS ratios to the primary structure of GC-C. Strikingly, all six positively-selected sites mapped to the extracellular ligand-binding domain of GC-C, whereas the intracellular domain is highly conserved ( Figure 1B, Table S3 ). These patterns of diversification of both STa and the GC-C ligandbinding domain support a model of recurring conflicts between diarrhea-causing bacteria and hosts over control of water secretion in the intestine.",

            "text": "Bats are known to harbor many types of viruses, including several human pathogens 14 . This widespread association with viruses is attributed to high density population structures and the ability of long-distance flight 15 . Notably, frequent infection with coronaviruses likely sparked high levels of sequence diversification in the viral entry receptor ACE-2 among bats 16 , illustrating the intensity of selection pathogens place on these species. In addition to viruses, bats can carry bacteria that act as human pathogens, including genera that encode STa 17 . Furthermore, STa variants have been detected in DNA isolated from the feces of wild bats 18 . Our detection of signals of intense positive selection in the GC-C ligand-binding domain of bats suggests that diarrheal pathogens may have profoundly impacted the evolution of bats, similar to their established coevolutionary relationship with viruses ( Figure 1B ). To test if rapid evolution of GC-C ligand-binding domains result in functional differences in STa susceptibility, we generated cell lines stably expressing GC-C from seven primate and five bat species. Functional diversity in these GC-C variants was assessed by measuring intracellular cGMP production in response to chemically synthesized uroguanylin and STa variants from four strains of pathogenic bacteria. HEK293T cells expressing human, chimpanzee, gorilla, gibbon and African green monkey GC-C generated similar levels of cGMP upon stimulation with STa variants from pathogenic E. coli (STp and STh), Yersinia enterocolitica (Y-ST), and Vibrio mimicus (V-ST) (Figure 2A , S5). In contrast, cells expressing GC-C from orangutan and rhesus macaque were significantly more susceptible to STp, showing a large increase in cGMP production relative to other species (Figure 2A ). Dose-response curves comparing maximal activation of human and orangutan GC-C to each toxin revealed similar maximal responses for human GC-C, while orangutan GC-C exhibited increases in relative vulnerability to STp and STh toxin variants compared to Y-ST and V-ST ( Figure 2B , 2C). Thus, variation in GC-C among primates results in differing levels of susceptibility to diverse toxins, providing evidence that ancient STa-like peptides influenced the course of GC-C evolution.",

            "text": "Differences in toxin susceptibility were even more pronounced among GC-C encoded by bats. We cloned GC-C from representatives of the vesper bats: Myotis lucifugus (little brown bat), Eptesicus fuscus (big brown bat), and Miniopterus natalensis (Natal longfingered bat), as well as Old World fruit bats: Pteropus vampyrus (large flying fox) and Pteropus alecto (black flying fox) for expression in cell lines. This sampling captures roughly a 50 million year interval of divergence from the common ancestor of chiropteran bats 19 . We discovered a wide range of susceptibility to STa variants across bat species. While GC-C from the vesper bats E. fuscus and M. natalensis responded similarly to all four toxins at high concentrations and produced modest levels of cGMP comparable to human GC-C, cells expressing M. lucifugus, P. vampyrus, and P. alecto GC-C produced nearly 10-fold more cGMP in response to toxin treatments ( Figure 2D -F). Intriguingly, both P. vampyrus and P. alecto failed to respond to treatment with 10 \u00b5M Y-ST in notable contrast to GC-C encoded by M. lucifugus ( Figure 2D ). Additional comparisons across a wide range of toxin concentrations revealed that P. vampyrus GC-C is only activated by Y-ST stimulation at concentrations exceeding 10 \u00b5M, well outside probable concentrations encountered during infection 20 ( Figure 2E ). Thus, consistent with strong signatures of positive selection for GC-C from bats, susceptibility to STa variants widely differs between bat species, with some receptors appearing resistant to activation at physiologically plausible concentrations of toxin.

Cultured organoids composed of intestinal enterocytes have recently emerged as a means to directly assay symptoms of secretory diarrhea 21 . In this system, GC-C mediated water secretion induces organoid swelling upon ligand stimulation, directly modeling symptoms of diarrhea. We cultured organoids derived from the small intestine of GC-C -/mice to investigate the relationship between cGMP production and water secretion across species. We chose to compare organoids expressing GC-C from humans and the fruit bat P. vampyrus, which displayed heightened susceptibility to STp, but marked resistance to Y-ST. While mouse GC-C -/organoids fail to respond to ligand stimulation, complementation with human or P. vampyrus GC-C via lentiviral transduction rescued swelling in response to STa ( Figure  3A , 3B). Organoids expressing P. vampyrus GC-C displayed considerably increased water secretion during STp treatment as measured by the total change in organoid area compared to organoids expressing human GC-C ( Figure 3A ). Consistent with our in vitro analysis, treatment with Y-ST resulted in minimal swelling of organoids expressing P. vampyrus GC-C compared to human ( Figure 3C , 3D). Thus, differences in susceptibility to STa variants likely have a direct influence on the level of water secretion and symptoms of diarrhea experienced by host species during infection.",

Sequence comparisons revealed that secreted uroguanylin peptides are generally highly conserved across mammals with little variation occurring outside the most N-and C-terminal residues ( Figure S4 ). In bats, however, uroguanylin sequences are highly variable, with frequent mutations occurring in core residues of the peptide ( Figure 4A ).

Treatment of cells expressing P. vampyrus GC-C with uroguanylin from M. lucifugus did not stimulate cGMP production, whereas treatment with P. vampyrus uroguanylin robustly activates catalytic activity ( Figure 4C ). Conversely, M. lucifugus GC-C responds more strongly to its speciesmatched uroguanylin than to the P. vampyrus peptide ( Figure 4B ). Intriguingly, E. fuscus GC-C responds weakly to all uroguanylin variants tested, including its own peptide ( Figure  4B ).

This intermediate state of low affinity with endogenous peptides is tolerated while toxin susceptible variants are culled from the population, given that survival is possible when GC-C signaling is disrupted 23 . Subsequent compensatory mutations in uroguanylin that optimize signaling interactions with GC-C might then outcompete mismatched variants with compromised receptorligand interfaces.
