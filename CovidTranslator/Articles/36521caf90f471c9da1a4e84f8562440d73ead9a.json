Although the number of cases outside of China remains small, mathematical modeling has identified the risk of spread of the disease to population centres and transit hubs in other countries, 5 with the possibility that the COVID-19 outbreak could become a global pandemic.",

This is primarily achieved by calculation of the basic reproduction number, denoted as \" , which measures the number of secondary cases that can be expected to be generated from a single case of the disease. 6 Initial research from the first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak estimated the basic reproduction number to be between 2.20 and 3.58, indicating large uncertainty in estimates of its infectiousness. 7, 8 Other unpublished estimates also placed the value of \" within this range, 9 with wide uncertainty. 5 All of these estimates of the basic reproduction number were based on data to the end of January, and did not use a long series of data from the period after the closure of Wuhan city. The data series for these reports also did not include significant periods of time after the Chinese New Year (24 th January, 2020), when a large number of people return to their home towns from large cities, with the attendant risk of significant spread of the disease. Wuhan city has a population of 11 million people 10 , but during the Chinese New Year as many as 5 million residents leave the city, and 70% of those who leave travel within Hubei province 11 , with the risk of significant spread of the disease within China, and especially across Hubei province, during the Chinese New Year period.",

We applied five methods to estimate \" in order to ensure that our estimate was robust to differences in assumptions about epidemic processes, differences in assumed underlying parameters, and about the nature of the dynamics of the affected population. We estimated the basic reproduction number for the whole period to be 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09 -3.70), a very high number indicative of a very fast rate of spread. We also estimated the basic reproduction number separately for the pre-closure period, finding that in the first 13 days of available high-quality data on the epidemic that the basic reproduction number was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63 -5.13), a very high number indicative of a highly infectious disease. Compared to this, we calculated the postclosure value of \" to be 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16 -3.65), still a very high number but significantly lower than that observed in the earlier days of the epidemic. This lower basic reproduction number, and the recent apparent reduction in numbers of new infections, justifies the decision to close Wuhan city, and also shows the potentially high impact of self-quarantine and voluntary exclusion methods. A separate study (not published) conducted by one of the study authors found that 25% of students in Guangdong did not leave their home in the Chinese New Year period, 90% increased their handwashing frequency, and over 80% used a mask when moving in public places. These voluntary measures, combined with the closure of Wuhan city, may have averted the spread of this disease and reduced its ability to reproduce through social changes. The reduction in infectiousness is particularly striking given the huge movement of people that typically occurs during Chinese New Year, and the risk of exposure in public transport and family gatherings at this time.",

Basic reproduction numbers in the 5-7 range are consistent with extremely contagious diseases such as mumps and smallpox, and indicate a disease with a very high risk of becoming a global pandemic. This finding has significant implications for cities like Singapore, Japan and London which are beginning to experience the first signs of spread of the disease without importation. In light of the epidemic threat identified here, these cities should consider implementing more aggressive prevention policies as necessary, while respecting human rights and the dignity of affected individuals and of those who might be disadvantaged by stricter quarantine and control mechanisms.",

First, the empirical data that previous studies used were collected before 25 th Jan, 2020. Testing protocols and diagnostic tools changed during the early period of the study 23 , and the number of diagnosed cases collected before 15 th January were considered underestimated and less reliable. This would flatten the epidemic curve in early studies, and the estimation of R0 based on these data may be underestimated and have larger confidence intervals. Second, previous studies only estimated the R0 based on a single method, and these estimates may have been affected by the implicit assumptions in these models. For example, a previous paper using the assumption of exponential growth found a value of \" of 2.68 (95% Credible interval 2.47 -2.86) 5 using an SEIR model with Metropolis-Hastings MCMC estimates of uncertainty, but our modeling has shown that this method likely underestimated the basic reproduction number during the pre-closure period. Our model avoids the limitations of specific modeling choices by combining several methods with a Poisson Loss weight, using the most current and accurate case diagnosis. Through this approach we calculate a more robust estimate than previous studies, and find a higher value of \" . Ours is also the first study to compare the pre-and post-closure periods in the data, and thus the first study to make a judgment about the effectiveness of this strategy. Given the high risk of epidemic from COVID-19, it is important to assess the value of this strategy before the disease takes hold in another global city.",

We did not estimate the values of the parameters defining the transition rate from exposed to infectious, or infected to recovered, but fixed them at previously published values. This was a necessary decision because the clinical features of the disease are not yet fully understood, and may affect estimates. However, our intuition after fitting these models is that the maximum likelihood estimate of the force of infection naturally adjusts to fit the value of the recovery rate, and produces a broadly similar value of the basic reproduction number as a result. Furthermore, to adjust for the still-arbitrary nature of these estimates of key parameters, we used some methods that do not depend on any assumptions about these aspects of the disease process. Another limitation of this study is the uncertainty introduced by the use of multiple modeling methods, which we combined with a weighted average. However, we believe that by presenting varying methods with different assumptions along with a weighted average, we enable researchers and policy-makers to make judgements about the dangers of the epidemic without relying on any particular set of assumptions about a disease that is not yet well understood.",
