            "text": "Symptoms of viral upper respiratory infection (URI) usually overlap with those of allergic rhinitis (AR), such as nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. Patients with AR mistakenly believe they have repeated viral infections that manifest as the common cold. Furthermore, it is difficult to differentiate the symptoms of AR aggravation from viral URI symptoms. Although the 2 are clearly distinctive, they share common clinical features. The pathogenetic relation between the 2 conditions is not fully understood. It is theoretically possible that allergen-induced inflammation and mucosal swelling in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses of patients with AR may make them more susceptible to viral or bacterial infections. 1, 2 Despite these assumptive inter-relations between the 2 conditions, the role of respiratory viruses as an aggravating factor of AR has not been established. Some previous studies have focused only on the severity of URI symptoms in patients with AR. In 1 cohort study, adult patients with AR showed not only a higher incidence of respiratory infections, especially in the number of severe episodes, but also a longer total duration of respiratory infection compared with adult patients without allergy. 3 In contrast, a prospective study has reported that there are no significant differences in the frequency and duration of URI between adult patients with AR and patients without allergy. 4 Viral respiratory infections act synergistically with allergen sensitization and exposure to exacerbate allergic asthma. 5, 6 Domestic exposure to allergens acts synergistically with viruses in sensitized patients, increasing the risk of hospital admission.",

However, to date, the exact pathogenetic role of respiratory viruses present in the upper airway of patients with AR has not been elucidated. Therefore, in this study, as a basic step for better understanding the role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of AR, the detection rate of respiratory viruses in patients with perennial AR (PAR) without URI symptoms was compared with that in control patients, and the symptom severity of AR was evaluated according to the presence of respiratory viruses.",

It has been reported that the Seeplex detection kit has high sensitivity and specificity comparable to the conventional viral culture. Coinfection was better detected by the multiplex PCR kit than by viral culture and immunofluorescence. 14 The overall detection rate of a respiratory virus was higher in patients with PAR than in controls. Specifically, a larger proportion of patients with respiratory virusepositive PAR had multiple viruses in their nasal lavage fluid compared with control patients without allergy. Although the clinical significance of multiple virus detection is debatable, the impaired innate immune response in patients with allergy could lead to multiple viral infections. Some researchers have reported that patients with allergic asthma and/or AR have impaired innate immune responses to respiratory viral infections. 15e18 Impaired interferon production associated with allergic sensitization may increase susceptibility to respiratory viral infection and compromise viral clearance, leading to long-term viral shedding.",

These results suggest that HRV could play a major role in the pathogenesis of AR or exist for a long period in an inflammatory state. In addition to HRV, the detection rate of PIV was relatively high in nasal lavage samples from the PAR and control groups, showing no significant difference between the 2 groups. This finding may be due to tropism of PIV to epithelial cells. 23 Viral respiratory infections induce inflammation of the nasal and sinus cavities. 24 Patients with seasonal AR inoculated with nasal HRV-16 outside the pollen season exhibited an increased responsiveness to the allergen, in part, through HRV-induced stimulation of eosinophil and neutrophil activities. 25, 26 In addition, the combination of respiratory virus detection and allergen exposure increases the risk of acute asthma exacerbation. 5, 6 Therefore, the authors sought to determine whether the persistence of a respiratory virus could aggravate mucosal inflammation in the patient with AR and subsequently cause more severe symptoms. However, in this study, there was no statistically significant association between AR symptom scores (TNSS) and the presence of respiratory viruses. This result suggests that patients with respiratory virusepositive PAR might not have more severe allergic symptoms compared with patients with respiratory virusenegative PAR. This result may be influenced by the use of oral antihistamine in the PAR group. Because discontinuation of oral antihistamine was not tolerable for the PAR group, this treatment could not be stopped in these study patients.",

The authors studied patients with PAR and not those with seasonal AR and enrolled roughly equal sample sizes over the months. Because the nasal allergy symptoms of patients with PAR can develop throughout the year, the authors tried to identify the association between the severity of allergic symptoms and respiratory viral infection. A limitation of this study is that nasal lavage samples were used to detect respiratory viruses. Nasal lavage fluid might have higher false-positive rates owing to an increased risk of trapping viruses that are floating in the ambient air. However, it was a distinctive observation that overall and multiple virus detection rates in patients with PAR were higher than those in patients without allergy. Therefore, this study was still valuable in showing a relation between adult patients with PAR and the presence of respiratory viruses. To the authors' knowledge, there has been no previous study that has investigated the detection of respiratory viruses in patients with PAR who have no evidence of viral URI. The present results raise the possibility that patients with PAR are vulnerable to respiratory viral infection and have persistent respiratory viral infections, in particular HRV.",
