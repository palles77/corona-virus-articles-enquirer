            "text": "Dicer-substrate siRNAs equipped with CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotides overcome the major hurdle in cell-specific siRNA delivery. The CpG-siRNA molecules are actively internalized by TLR9 + cells, without the need for transfection reagents, leading to RNA interference both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms of CpG-siRNA processing in target cells. We show that shortly after uptake into early endosomes (EE), CpG and siRNA parts of the conjugate are uncoupled in the presence of Dicer endonuclease. Diced siRNA molecules are translocated from endosomes to endoplasmic reticulum, where they can interact with the RNA interference machinery. We previously observed that even though TLR9 is not involved in CpG-siRNA uptake, it is indispensable for induction of gene silencing. To explain the role of TLR9 in intracellular processing of CpG-siRNA, we used primary macrophages derived from wild-type and Tlr9-deficient mice. Macrophages lacking TLR9 showed extended endosomal colocalization of CpG and siRNA parts of the conjugate. However, Tlr9 ablation did not interfere with the interaction of CpG-siRNA with Dicer as shown by in situ proximity ligation assay. Using CpG-siRNA labeled with pH-sensitive dye, we finally identified that lack of TLR9 in macrophages resulted in significant retention of the siRNA in endosomes. Thus, TLR9 facilitates the critical step following CpG-siRNA uncoupling, which is cytoplasmic release of the diced siRNA. These findings suggest that the class of immunostimulatory siRNAs may benefit from activation of",

            "text": "Since its discovery by Fire and Mellow in 1998, siRNA has proven to be a powerful tool for modulating the expression of almost any gene in various species. Several studies demonstrated the feasibility of in vivo siRNA delivery, leading to therapeutic effects not only in mice [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] but also in non-human-primates [6, 7] . More recently, gene silencing after systemic siRNA administration was demonstrated in humans [8] . However, there are still severe hurdles to wide therapeutic application of this technology, such as cell-specific siRNA delivery and efficient release into cytoplasm [9] . There have been several innovative attempts to solve these problems using modular design of siRNA conjugated to cell-specific antibodies [1] or RNA aptamers [4, 5] . Others used combinations of siRNA with lipid reagents or cholesterol to enable siRNA uptake without the need for molecule encapsulation using potentially toxic lipid reagents [9] . Nevertheless, most of delivery methods result in endosomal rather than cytoplasmic siRNA uptake [10] .",

            "text": "Due to rapid progress of this field, the rational design of siRNA reagents is hampered by gaps in our understanding of their intracellular processing. For many delivery strategies the mechanisms of siRNA release into cytoplasm are still unclear. In case of modified siRNAs that undergo rapid protonation in endosomes, the suggested release mechanism is swelling and burst of endosomes called a \"proton sponge effect\" [10] . This process does not explain the cytoplasmic release of siRNA conjugates linked to antibodies or RNA aptamers which is usually limited due to their large size [10, 11] . Timely siRNA release is critical because loaded early endosomes (EE) undergo a series of transformational events called maturation, resulting in significant decrease of endosomal pH and recruitment of proteases and RNAases [12] . The conversion of early into late endosomes may take as little as 20 min, and additional 20 min are required to fuse with lysosomes leading to the degradation of the vesicle content [12] . In addition, location of various downstream components of siRNA processing machinery is not well defined. Dicer endonuclease was originally found in the cytoplasm [13] , but later studies indicated that it might be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [14] . More recent reports found that Ago2 endonuclease, a major component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), likely resides on multi-vesicular bodies (MVB), which are intermediates between early and late endosomes [15] . These findings agree well with one of two major hypotheses of RISC complex assembly, which identifies Ago2 on the surface of EE and MVBs [10] . A slight variation of this assumption is that RISC is located in P-bodies, which in turn are associated with GW-bodies located on the cytoplasmic side of MVB membranes [10, 15] . In contrast, others have shown that RISC colocalizes with large subunits of ribosomes anchored to the rough ER, thus blocking translation of target mRNA [16] .",

Very recently, we optimized CpG-siRNA design to target human immune and cancer cells. Blocking of STAT3 or BCL-X L survival signaling inhibited in vivo growth in several xenotransplanted blood cancer models [21] . In addition, the conjugate retained its immunostimulatory properties and activated various populations of human DCs and B cells [21] . An unexpected finding of our recent studies was that both TLR9 expression and activation were required for the target gene silencing but not for the conjugate uptake. In vitro studies using CpG-siRNA in Tlr9 \u2212/\u2212 cells failed to detect RNA interference (RNAi) in target cells. Here, we delineate the critical initial steps and the role of TLR9 in CpG-siRNA processing. We believe that identifying biomarkers for target selection and molecules indispensable for the therapeutic effect will accelerate the clinical translation of the CpG-siRNA strategy for cancer therapy. Finally, we anticipate that this information will support and accelerate the rational design of other types of immunostimulatory siRNAs.",

Even though TLR9 did not participate in the CpG-siRNA uptake, it was critical for silencing of various target genes in vitro in mouse and human cells. Altogether, these results prompted us to elucidate the role of TLR9 in facilitating CpG-siRNA-mediated gene silencing effect. First, we assessed the process of CpG-siRNA internalization by target immune cells. We have previously demonstrated that CpG-siRNAs can rapidly enter target cells through endocytosis. CpG FITC -Stat3 siRNA 5\u2032SS-Cy3 was clearly detectable in endosomes within less than 30 min of incubation, as shown by transmission electron microscopy ( Fig 1A) in agreement with our previous study [18] . The CpG-siRNA was actively internalized by target immune cells under normal physiological conditions and the process was abrogated at 4\u00b0C (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The internalization of CpG ODNs is reportedly mediated by surface receptors from scavenger family [25, 26] . Due to functional redundancy of scavenger receptors (SRs), we decided to assess the effect of dextran sulfate, a general competitive SR inhibitor [27] , on CpG-siRNA uptake, as described before [25, 26] . As shown in Fig. 1B , pre-incubation of RAW 264.7 cells with dextran sulfate blocked the internalization of CpG-siRNA 5\u2032SS-Cy3 as measured using flow cytometry. In contrast, the control chondroitin sulfate, which does not bind SRs [27] , failed to affect the conjugate internalization.",

To assess the timing and efficiency of CpG-siRNA cleavage, we developed an in situ confocal imaging approach based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between both parts of the conjugate. CpG-siRNA molecules were equipped with FITC label (donor) in the linker region and with Cy3 label (acceptor) added via another linker to the 5\u2032 end of the siRNA antisense strand. Flexibility of the linker regions permits close proximity of both fluorochromes required for the energy transfer from the excited donor to the acceptor, which results in emission in Cy3 spectrum (max. at 570 nm). The donor-acceptor pair would be separated after the conjugate cleavage by Dicer endonuclease into 3 parts: CpG FITC -linker-stick, 21-mer siRNA and short Cy3-labeled terminal fragment of AS siRNA. To verify that changes in FRET intensities result from processing of the siRNA part of the conjugate, we compared emission spectra of dual FITC/Cy3-labeled CpG-Stat3 siRNA without or with nuclease resistant 2\u2032O-methyl (2\u2032OMe) modified siRNA. As shown in Fig. 2A and 2B, in RAW 264.7 cells the FRET effect induced by the unmodified conjugate was transient, decreasing by half within 2.5 h. In contrast, the FRET signal induced by 2\u2032OMe CpG-siRNA remained elevated and even slightly increased at 2.5 h. These results suggested that CpG-siRNA processing occurs early after internalization and requires cleavage of the siRNA part of the molecule.",

First, we confirmed using confocal microscopy that already 0.5 h after CpG-siRNA 5\u2032SS-Cy3 uptake, most of the conjugate was colocalized with Dicer in endosomal vesicles (Fig. 2C) . In fact, both Dicer and TLR9 were found in similar vesicular localization in RAW 264.7 cells even before treatment ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . Thus, CpG-siRNA uncoupling can occur right after internalization into TLR9/Dicer containing endosomes. For direct proof of interaction between Dicer and its substrate, CpG-siRNA, we used the in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) which enables visualization and quantification of the interaction between two molecules in intact fixed cells [28] . Briefly, the molecules examined are identified by a pair of unconjugated primary antibodies, and IgG secondary antibodies equipped with DNA primers which form circular template only when in close proximity. The circular DNA becomes a template for rolling circle DNA polymerase, which amplifies DNA repeats. Further, those repeats are recognized by complimentary oligonucleotides labeled with a fluorophore, and a fluorescent signal is detected using confocal microscopy. Using antibodies specific to Dicer and fluorescein in CpG FITC -siRNA, we found that both molecules colocolized in mouse macrophages as early as 0.5 h after treatment, reaching maximum at 1 h and decreasing thereafter (Fig. 2DE) . These results demonstrate that Dicer interaction with CpG-siRNA coincides with siRNA uncoupling as observed by FRET assays, thus underscoring the role of Dicer for initial CpG-siRNA processing.",

Our initial confocal microscopy studies on mouse macrophages showed that Ago2 is detectable on a subset of EE under basal conditions ( Supplementary Fig. 3) , and also associated with the ER but only after CpG-siRNA treatment (Fig. 3A) . To follow further trafficking of fluorescently labeled siRNA molecules in RAW 264.7 cells, we used a duallabeled CpG FITC -Stat3 siRNA 5\u2032SS-Cy3 , which allowed us to visualize both parts of the conjugate before and after cleavage. We also included 2\u2032OMe CpG-siRNA as a negative control, similar to as shown in Fig. 2A . Confocal microscopy analysis showed that initially colocalized CpG FITC and siRNA 5\u2032SS-Cy3 parts of the unmodified but not 2\u2032OMe-modified conjugates were clearly separated at 3 h (Fig. 3B, top row) . The siRNA 5\u2032SS-Cy3 molecules were found both in vesicles and within the endoplasmic reticulum as confirmed by staining for the ER maker, calnexin (Fig. 3B ). In contrast, the CpG FITC was contained in a distinct vesicular compartment (Fig. 3B ). Using staining with Rab 7, the late endosomal marker, we confirmed that the CpG fragment in fact remains in maturing endosomes likely bound to TLR9 (Supplementary Fig. 4 ). To confirm that siRNA can efficiently escape from early rather than maturing endosomes, we used chloroquine, a commonly used inhibitor of endosomal acidification that causes bursting of maturing endosomes [29] . We compared levels of Stat3 silencing induced in RAW 264.7 cells by CpG-Stat3 siRNA or control nontargeting CpG-Luc siRNA in the presence or absence of chloroquine. As shown in Fig. 3C , chloroquine did not affect Stat3 gene silencing confirming that siRNA molecules are efficiently uncoupled and released without significant endosomal retention. Finally, we verified whether the effect of 2\u2032OMe-modified oligonucleotides in our experiments is not a result of their ability to act as potent TLR7 antagonists [30] . Our control experiments did not detect any difference in the siRNA transport to ER in the presence or absence of 2\u2032OMemodifed CpG-siRNA ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ).",

To assess whether TLR9 plays a role in the endosomal release of the diced siRNA, we used primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from WT and Tlr9 \u2212/\u2212 mice. First, we addressed a question of whether TLR9 expression is required for the CpG-siRNA interaction with Dicer. The PLA assay in macrophages treated with CpG FITC -Stat3 siRNA indicated that Dicer endonuclease colocalizes with CpG-siRNA in both WT and Tlr9 \u2212/\u2212 cells, independently from TLR status ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). However, this transient interaction was significantly extended in Tlr9 \u2212/\u2212 cells, which suggested impaired CpG-siRNA processing or endosomal release. To explain this observation, we incubated primary WT and Tlr9 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages with dual-labeled CpG FITC -Stat3 siRNA 5\u2032SS-Cy3 and assessed the intracellular conjugate processing by confocal microscopy. The release of diced siRNA 5\u2032SS-Cy3 from EE was delayed in Tlr9 \u2212/\u2212 cells and the colocalization of both fluorescent signals was still detectable after 2.5 h of treatment in contrast to WT cells (Supplementary Fig. 6 ).",

The fluorescent intensity of emission for pHrodo inversely correlates with the pH of the environment, thus permitting the detection of changes in pH due to transition from EE (pH 5.9-6.0) either to cytoplasm/ER (pH 7.0-7.2) or to late endosomes (pH 5.0-6.0) (Supplementary Fig. 7A ) [31] . Using time-lapse imaging, we recorded and digitally quantified changes in the pHrodo intensity in primary WT and Tlr9 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages treated with CpG-siRNA 5\u2032SS-pHrodo . As shown in Fig. 4AB , the intensity of fluorescent signal from pHrodo in WT cells decreased rapidly by more than 60% between 1-2 h of incubation and was barely detectable after 4 h. In contrast, the signal intensity in Tlr9 \u2212/\u2212 cells dropped initially by about 30% but then remained relatively unchanged for up to 4.7 h. To verify that observed changes in pHrodo intensity in fact resulted from the conjugate cleavage and cytoplasmic release of the siRNA 5\u2032SS-pHrodo , we repeated the experiment using 2\u2032OMe-modified CpG-siRNA similar to as in Fig. 3 (and Supplementary Fig. 7BC ). Confirming our earlier observation (Fig. 2AB) , only a small fraction of the unprocessed conjugate was released from endosomes in WT cells. In Tlr9 \u2212/\u2212 cells the release of intact conjugate was negligible, resulting in increase of the pHrodo signal with progressing endosome acidification ( Supplementary Fig. 7BC ).",

            "text": "Mature and fully functional TLR9 is located in EE [29] , thus it is not directly responsible for ligand internalization. Our results identified that CpG-siRNA undergoes endocytosis by dextran sulfate-sensitive receptors of scavenger family. This observation agrees well with previous reports that suggested role of several scavenger receptors in CpG ODN internalization, including SR-B1, CXCL16 and others due to their functional redundancy [25, 26] . In addition, binding to cofactors can also affect oligonucleotide delivery especially in vivo as shown for granulin-bound CpG ODNs, with drastically enhances delivery to endosomes [32] . Thus, CpG-siRNAs can be internalized also by TLR9-negative but SR-positive target cells. However, SR are known to be expressed mostly in immune cells with ability to internalize macromolecules, such as dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, which also express TLR9. Thus, CpG-siRNA uptake by mouse or human target cells usually correlates with constitutive or inducible TLR9 expression, as in differentiating monocytes [21] . In all scenarios, CpG ODN is quickly internalized into EE and binds to TLR9 present in the same location as quickly as in 5 min after treatment [33] . We found similar rapid kinetics of internalization also in case of CpG-siRNA conjugates. Interestingly, our FRET studies indicated that endonuclease-dependent uncoupling of the siRNA from the CpG part occurs early after uptake of the conjugate, while still in the EE. The extended 25/27mer siRNA molecules are known to be targets of Dicer, which trims these molecules to 21/21mer siRNA [17] . We have previously shown in vitro that Dicer cleaves CpG-siRNA in a similar manner, releasing 21/21mer siRNA [18] . Our current study verifies these results in both living and fixed cells using FRET and confocal imaging. We demonstrate for the first time that Dicer colocalizes with TLR9 in the endosomal compartment and transiently interacts with the target oligonucleotide in EE as early as 30 min after the conjugate uptake. It remains to be determined whether Dicer operates inside the endosome or rather on the endosomal membrane, where other components of the RNAi machinery are located [15] .",

Our experiments with chloroquine, an inhibitor of endosomal maturation, confirmed that siRNA release is very effective and likely occurs before conversion of EE to MVB and late endosomes. The uncoupled siRNA molecules seem to escape from EE before they undergo acidification, fuse to lysosomes, and start degrading their content [34] . Following the endosomal escape, siRNA molecules must enter into RISC in order to initiate the RNAi. As suggested by recent studies, major RISC components, such as Ago2, are present on a cytoplasmic side of membranes of both endosomes and ER [10, 16] . Our results show that Ago2 is constitutively present on some EEs as well as partly associated with ER but only in cells treated with the CpG-siRNA conjugate. We also found that after uncoupling from the CpG-siRNA conjugate, diced siRNA is translocated to ER. According to multiple references, siRNA processed by Dicer is immediately passed over to Ago2 through the TRBP protein, a part of the RISC loading complex, which binds to both Dicer and Ago2 [11, 34, 35] . Binding to Ago2 effectively protects the AS (guide) strand of siRNA from hazardous nucleases throughout the RNAi process [36] . We anticipate that the presence of Ago2 on EE and on the ER can facilitate the transfer of siRNA from one location to another, as suggested by our results indicating relocation of newly formed endosomes from the cellular membrane towards the perinuclear cisterns of the ER. Such transport mechanism implemented by motor proteins dynein and kinesin would eliminate the need for release of naked siRNA into the cytoplasm, where viscosity and concentration of nucleases can be high [10, 37] .",

These processes are related to antigen cross-presentation, which allows for delivery of phagosomal antigens to MHC class I complexes in various immune cells from DCs and macrophages to B cells [39] . In antigen cross-presentation, phagosomes fuse with the ER to acquire a number of ER-specific proteins, which are critical for transmembrane transport of various molecules [40] . TLR9 activation is known to stimulate phagocytosis and cross-presentation of antigens in the cytosol [41] [42] [43] . Specifically, TLR9 can regulate microtubule-assisted transport of EE toward the ER, and the early release of endosomal content before acidification [10, 41, 42] . Our results suggest that a similar TLR9-regulated mechanism may be employed for the release of siRNA diced from the CpG-siRNA conjugate. TLR9 does not seem to be required for recruitment of Dicer, which is already present in TLR9-positive EE. However, our experiments in Tlr9 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages provide evidence that TLR9 does facilitate endosomal release of uncoupled siRNA. Our further studies should establish whether a canonical downstream TLR9 signaling regulates the release of siRNA uncoupled from CpG-siRNA conjugates. In addition, the involvement of other endosomal TLRs, such as TLR3 and TLR7, in conjugate processing and siRNA release cannot be excluded and will be addressed by experiments in specific TLR-deficient cell models.",

We have also demonstrated that this approach is suitable for direct elimination of human TLR9-positive cancer cells, such as certain blood cancers [18] [19] [20] [21] . Intriguingly, our studies identified differences in the efficiency of target gene silencing in human cells using siRNA conjugated to A-and B-types of CpG ODN (Kortylewski, unpublished data) . Since various types of CpG ODNs differ in timing and type of downstream TLR9 signaling, it is likely that these events can be critical determinants of CpG-siRNA efficacy. Our findings imply that TLR9 triggering might also enhance the endosomal release of siRNA delivered by other than CpG ODN strategies, including RNA aptamers or monoclonal antibodies. We believe that understanding the requirements for effective induction of RNAi in target cells will facilitate further optimization of not only CpG-siRNA but potentially also other siRNA delivery approaches for human cancer therapy.",
