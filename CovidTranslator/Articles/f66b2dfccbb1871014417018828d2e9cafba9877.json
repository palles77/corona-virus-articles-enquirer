First, in a follow-on from the RV144 clinical trial in Thailand that demonstrated safety and modest efficacy for an HIV preventive vaccine [7] , the HVTN702 trial is testing an ALVAC-C prime with an ALVAC-C+ bivalent envelope (gp120 env) protein/MF59 boost (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02968849). About half of the target population of 5400 adults have been enrolled in South Africa as of February 2018. Second, the HVTN705 trial, which is using an Ad26 vector prime with an Ad26+ gp140 env protein boost, is aiming for global cross-clade protection (NCT03060629). This study will enroll 2600 women in six African countries. Based on recent recommendations in high-risk populations, all participants are offered the state-ofthe-art HIV risk reduction method, pre-exposure prophylaxis [8, 9] . Additional studies evaluating different adjuvants and priming regimens are running in parallel to inform clinical development. HIV immunization strategies will pose delivery challenges because they will target high-risk adult populations that are not routinely vaccinated and require complex vaccination regimens: GVIRF participants noted that implementation research will be crucial to efficiently protecting these populations.",

Early analysis showed that both were well-tolerated. While neither vaccine showed statistical significance in preventing initial infection, BCG re-vaccination demonstrated a statistically significant 45.4% reduction of sustained infection and H4:IC31 gave a statistically significant 30.5% reduction of sustained infection [12] . These results are informing further TB vaccine product development and may support identification of correlates of protection. Studies of additional vaccine candidates are expected to generate efficacy data in 2018. (Since this meeting, results have been published showing that the recombinant M72/AS01 vaccine was significantly protective against tuberculosis disease [13] ). Priorities for TB vaccine research include developing a controlled human infection model and understanding how alternative clinical endpoints such as prevention of infection, disease, recurrence, or reinfection can be used to inform disease control strategies.",

While RTS,S is predicted to have substantial health impact [15] , GVIRF participants observed that there remains a need for malaria vaccines with high and durable efficacy that are effective against both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, that can interrupt transmission, and that are suitable for use in older children and adults (including pregnant women).

CMV-based vector vaccines elicit and maintain high frequency ''effector memory\" T-cell responses in mucosal sites, lymphoid tissues, and parenchymal organs of nonhuman primates. Because they efficiently re-infect and persist despite robust anti-CMV immunity, CMV-based vectors can be used repeatedly to induce responses against successive antigens [23] . A highly attenuated human CMV-vectored HIV vaccine is now in cGMP manufacturing and slated for clinical testing in 2019. PLLAV are E. coli-produced DNA vaccines that upon administration replicate in mammalian cells, assemble into virus particles, and infect and are amplified by surrounding cells. They can function as a live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine, as demonstrated by proof-of-concept studies in small animals and non-human primates. This approach has the potential to serve as a platform technology for other targets, including pathogens of epidemic potential such as Lassa fever virus.",

For rabies, the first prophylactic mAb (Serum Institute of India, Rabishield), has been approved in India. To facilitate broader licensure and use of rabies mAbs, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) is clarifying regulatory considerations, and WHO is evaluating policy recommendations. For HIV, the Antibody Mediated Prevention studies are testing a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 mAb, VRC01 (e.g. NCT02411539). These studies are expected to provide results in the 2020 timeframe. For respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a prophylactic mAb that requires monthly administration (AstraZeneca, palivizumab) has been on the market for over a decade. A Phase 2B study of an extended half-life RSV prefusion F-protein mAb in healthy preterm infants is nearing completion with results expected in 2018 (NCT02878330). If successful, this product would be more affordable than the existing mAb and require only a single administration. For influenza, broadly protective mAbs have applications in the treatment of severe influenza, prevention of infection when vaccination is not feasible (such as early during a pandemic), and for vaccine antigen discovery. The influenza mAb pipeline includes candidates with confirmed effects on virus shedding when administered post-challenge in CHIMs [24] .",

To reduce the risk of type 2 cVDPV emerging just as population immunity began to decline, the switch was made in synchrony in minimal time and included the destruction of tOPV stocks. In addition, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was introduced into the routine immunization schedules to limit the risks of an immunity gap to type 2 poliovirus [35, 37, 38] . Since the switch, the number of countries detecting type 2 cVDPV has decreased by 83% [39] ; it is, however, still causing outbreaks, particularly in areas with low vaccine coverage.
