            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has continued to cause sporadic outbreaks in Thailand since 2007 and a pandemic variant containing an insertion and deletion in the spike gene was responsible for outbreaks. In 2014, there were further outbreaks of the disease occurring within four months of each other. In this study, the fulllength genome sequences of two genetically distinct PEDV isolates from the outbreaks were characterized. The two PEDV isolates, CBR1/2014 and EAS1/2014, were 28,039 and 28,033 nucleotides in length and showed 96.2% and 93.6% similarities at nucleotide and amino acid levels respectively. In total, we have observed 1048 nucleotide substitutions throughout the genome. Compared to EAS1/2014, CBR1/2014 has 2 insertions of 4 ( 56 GENQ 59 ) and 1 ( 140 N) amino acid positions 56-59 and 140, and 2 deletions of 2 ( 160 DG 161 ) and 1 ( 1199 Y) amino acid positions 160-161 and 1199. The phylogenetic analysis based on full-length genome of CBR1/2014 isolate has grouped the virus with the pandemic variants. In contrast, EAS1/2014 isolate was grouped with CV777, LZC and SM98, a classical variant. Our findings demonstrated the emergence of EAS1/2014, a classical variant which is novel to Thailand and genetically distinct from the currently circulating endemic variants. This study warrants further investigations into molecular epidemiology and genetic evolution of the PEDV in Thailand.",

PEDV is a causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a devastating enteric disease characterized by watery diarrhea, dehydration and high mortality in pigs younger than one week of age (Pensaert and De Bouck, 1978) . PED was first reported in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1976 (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978 Pensaert and De Bouck, 1978; Wood, 1977) . The disease was subsequently reported in several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and Thailand, and became endemic, causing significant welfare and economic problems (Li et al., 2012; Park et al., 2007a; Song and Park, 2012; Temeeyasen et al., 2014; Vui et al., 2015) . Since 2013, there has been an emergence of a highly virulent PEDV in the North American continent and its subsequent reports from several countries worldwide.",

            "text": "The genome of PEDV is approximately 28 kb in length and comprises seven open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a and ORF1b, spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N) (Kocherhans et al., 2001) . Two thirds of the genome is occupied by ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode nonstructural proteins. The other 4 structural proteins, S, E, M, and N, are located downstream of the ORF1a/1b gene. ORF3 is located between S and E and encodes an accessory protein. The S gene encodes S glycoprotein, which can be divided into the S1 and S2 domains. The S glycoprotein plays an important role in binding to specific host cell receptors. The S1 domain of S glycoprotein stimulates the production of neutralizing antibodies by the host (Chang et al., 2002; Cruz et al., 2006 Cruz et al., , 2008 Duarte and Laude, 1994; Sun et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2007) . The ORF3 gene is the only accessory gene and is an important determinant of virulence in PEDV (Park et al., 2008; Park et al., 2007b) . Vaccine-derived isolates have a unique deletion of 17 amino acids at positions 82 to 99 (Park et al., 2008; Park et al., 2007b) . The other E and M genes are associated with viral envelope formation and release (Kocherhans et al., 2001) . The N protein is the predominate antigen produced in coronavirus-infected cells and is thus a major viral target (Kocherhans et al., 2001) . Two PEDV variants, classic and pandemic, are currently recognized (Sun et al., 2015) which typed as genogroups 1 and 2, respectively (Chen et al., 2014) , and can be distinguished by the spike gene. The pandemic variant contains two insertions of 4 ( 56 GENQ 59 ) and 1 ( 140 N) amino acids at positions 55-60 and 140, respectively, and a deletion of 2 amino acids ( 160 DG 161 ) at positions 160-161 (Li et al., 2012) .",

The region exhibiting the highest percentage of sequence difference between the two isolates ( Fig. 4) and thus potentially discriminating the pandemic variants from the classic variants was located approximately in the 120-to 260-bp region of the S gene and involved 11 amino acid changes and 4 insertions/deletions.",

The two PEDV variants were isolated from a herd that experienced two episodes of PED outbreak 4 months apart in 2014. The isolates responsible for the first and second PED outbreaks were CBR1/2014 and EAS1/2014, respectively. To determine the genetic relationships of the 2 PEDV variants, phylogenetic analyses of the whole genome, and spike and ORF genes were separately constructed, and the results demonstrated that the two PEDV variants were groups in a different cluster in all 3 trees constructed. A previous report demonstrated that PEDV isolated in Thailand in 2007-2013 was grouped in cluster G2, the pandemic group (Temeeyasen et al., 2014) . CBR1/2014 clustered in cluster G2, suggesting that the isolate is an endemic Thai PEDV variant. By contrast, EAS1/2014, the PEDV isolate detected in the second outbreak, clustered in G1, the classical variant group, and is more genetically related to LZC, SM98 and CV777. These findings suggest that EAS1/2014 is a novel isolate recently isolated in Thailand and may have been externally introduced into the herd to cause the second outbreak, rather than the product of continuing evolution of existing PEDV in the herd. The antigenic distinction and route of introduction remain to be further elucidated.",

The short time interval between the first and second outbreaks may indicate a low level of protective immunity against PEDV in the herd and/or the introduction of antigenically distinct PEDV isolates. We therefore explored the antigenic differences between the CBR1/2014 and EAS1/ 2014 isolates, particularly the S and ORF3 genes, which encode neutralizing epitopes and attenuation markers, respectively.

CBR1/2014 contains 2 amino acid insertions, 56 GENQ 59 and 140 N, and a 1 amino acid deletion at 160 DG 161 . However, EAS1/2014, a novel isolate, contains no insertions or deletions at these sites. In addition, differences between these two variants were identified at amino acid position 504-643 and 769-776, which encode neutralizing epitopes (Chang et al., 2002; Cruz et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008) . Therefore, differences in the neutralizing epitope region may explain the shorter duration of protection compared to the 6-month homologous protection reported previously (Goede et al., 2015) . These 2 variants may provide partial protection. In addition to the S gene, the ORF3 gene was further analyzed. ORF3 is an important determinant of virulence in PEDV (Park et al., 2008; Park et al., 2007b) and can be used to differentiate between attenuated vaccine and field isolates. Vaccine-derived isolates have a unique deletion of 17 amino acids at positions 82-99 (Park et al., 2008; Park et al., 2007b) . However, the novel isolate EAS1/2014 does not contain the 17-amino-acid deletion in the ORF3 gene that serves as a marker of the attenuated vaccine strain (Park et al., 2008) .

In ORF1, the regions between nt 2995-3090 are the hypervariable region between the nsp2 and nsp3 genes and are reported to be the putative region for a recombination event (Huang et al., 2013) . The positive selection in the N gene is consistent with a recent finding suggesting that the N gene also contains a hypervariable region. Interestingly, the S and ORF3 genes were neutrally selected even though both genes have hypervariable regions. This neutral evolution indicates that the evolution was due to mutation and antigenic drift, not genetic selection. The neutral selection in the S and ORF3 genes suggests that the virus was externally introduced rather than continuously evolved in the population, resulting in the emergence of a novel viral isolate.",
