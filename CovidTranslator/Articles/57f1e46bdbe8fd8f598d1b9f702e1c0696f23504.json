Detailed population-genetic study in village Chepure, which includes 20 large families where BEN is present in 646 (from first to fourth degree) relatives of probands, shows a familial character of disease as well as significant genetic influences in expression of the illness. Our study of genetic homozygosity degree includes an analysis of the presence, distribution and individual combination of 20 to 30 selected genetically controlled morphophysiological traits in the sample of BEN patients and in the control-healthy group. Assuming that BEN is genetically controlled disease, we made a hypothesis that an increased homozygosity level, as well as the changed variability among the patients, could be populationgenetic parameter for the prediction of the illness. Taking into consideration our experience, as well as the experience of numerous scientists who studied the nature of the inheritance of mono-and oligo-genically controlled qualitative traits, we applied a methodology to estimate the proportion of such homozygously recessive characters (HRC-test). This population-genetic study did not only show statistically significant difference of the mean values of genetic homozygosity (BEN: 8.7 \u00b1 0.3; control: 7.6 \u00b1 0.3), but of the differences in the type of distribution too, as well as the differences in the presence of certain individual combinations of such traits.",

However, knowing the type of inheritance and variability, it can be seen that a series of morphophysiological traits are under control of one or a small number of genes. Several studies, which established distribution and frequency of a series of extremely expressed recessive traits, show quite a difference in the presence of such traits among observed groups of individuals (i.e. comparison between ill and healthy individuals, pupils from special and regular schools, carriers of different blood types) [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . The studied homozygous characteristics are obviously controlled by genes located on different human chromosomes, so that they could be considered as markers of these chromosomes, as well as of numerous surrounding genes controlling different components of fitness. The amount of recessive homozygosity estimated by our HRC-test is practically an estimation of genetic loads present in human population, or in any specific sample of human individuals [9, [20] [21] [22] .",
