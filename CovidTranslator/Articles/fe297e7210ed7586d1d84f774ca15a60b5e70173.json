Since then, this highly contagious COVID-19 has been spreading worldwide, with a rapid rise in the number of deaths. Novel COVID-19-infected pneumonia (NCIP) is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. A variety of chest imaging features have been reported, similar to those found in other types of coronavirus syndromes. The purpose of the present review is to briefly discuss the known epidemiology and the imaging findings of coronavirus syndromes, with a focus on the reported imaging findings of NCIP. Moreover, the authors review precautions and safety measures for radiology department personnel to manage patients with known or suspected NCIP. Implementation of a robust plan in the radiology department is required to prevent further transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members.",

These patients presented with symptoms of severe pneumonia, including fever, fatigue, dry cough, and respiratory distress. Novel COVID-19infected pneumonia (NCIP) is believed to have originated in a wet \"seafood market\" in Wuhan. The virus, which has been reported in 28 countries as of this writing, has shown human-to-human transmission and is feared to have the potential to cause a pandemic [2, 3] . The mean incubation period is estimated to be 5.2 days, which allows air travelers to spread the disease globally [4] . Evidence shows that virus transmission can occur during the incubation period in asymptomatic patients. Moreover, high sputum viral loads were found in a patient with NCIP during the recovery phase [5] . As of February 5, 2020, more than 25,000 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, with a rapid rise in the number of deaths. The World Health Organization has announced the outbreak a global health emergency.",

A recent report in The Lancet described the clinical manifestations of NCIP in 41 patients [16] . According to that report, abnormal chest imaging findings were observed in all patients, with 40 having bilateral disease at initial imaging. This early report on the presentation of the NCIP in intensive care unit patients indicated bilateral subsegmental areas of air-space consolidation, whereas in non-intensive care unit patients, transient areas of subsegmental consolidation are seen early, with bilateral ground-glass opacities being predominant later in the course of the disease (Figs. 1-3) . Serial chest radiography of a 61year-old man who died of NCIP showed progressively worsening bilateral consolidation during a course of 7 days. Another report on 99 individuals with confirmed NCIP described similar imaging findings, with bilateral lung involvement in 75% and unilateral involvement in 25% [17] . Another study of five individuals in a family cluster with NCIP [18] described bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities, with more extensive involvement of lungs parenchyma in older family members. The reported imaging features most closely resemble those of MERS and SARS. No pleural effusion or cavitation has been reported so far in confirmed cases of NCIP, but pneumothorax was reported in 1% of patients (1 of 99) in a study by Chen et al [17] . Overall, the imaging findings are highly nonspecific and might overlap with the symptoms of H1N1 influenza, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, or atypical pneumonia. The acute clinical presentation and history of contact with a Journal of the American College of Radiology COVID-19-infected patient or history of recent travel to an eastern Asian country (eg, China, South Korea, or Japan) should raise clinical suspicion for the diagnosis of NCIP. Although further investigations on the clinical and radiologic aspects of the COVID-19 are ongoing, imaging will continue to be a crucial component in patient management.",

The novel COVID-19 is highly contagious and is believed to transmit mostly through respiratory droplets, but there is uncertainty as to whether the virus can be transmitted by touching a surface or an item that is contaminated (ie, a fomite). A thorough understanding of the routes of virus transmission will be essential for patients' and health care professionals' safety. Droplets have the greatest risk of transmission within 3 ft (91.44 cm), but they may travel up to 6 ft (183 cm) from their source [19] . For the purpose of diagnostic imaging in individuals with NCIP, whenever possible, portable radiographic equipment should be used to limit transportation of patients. On the basis of experience with SARS, the use of a satellite radiography center and dedicated radiographic equipment can decrease the risk for transmission from known infected individuals. If a patient needs to be transported to the radiology department, he or she should wear a surgical mask during transport to and from the department.",
