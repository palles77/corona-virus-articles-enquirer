Since 2015, healthcare-associated transmission has decreased as infection prevention and control practices have improved (6) ; however, sporadic cases continue to be reported, often associated with contact with dromedaries (4,7). Surveillance and routine investigation of recent MERS cases are critical to monitor the epidemiology of this emerging pathogen. We characterized exposures and demographics of MERS cases reported to the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health during July 1-October 31, 2017, and June 1-September 16, 2018, and performed molecular characterization of available specimens to describe circulating viruses during these periods.",

To further characterize exposures among sporadic cases (no known epidemiologic link to a hospital outbreak or known case) reported during July 1-October 31, 2017, we conducted telephone interviews using a standardized questionnaire addressing demographics and activities during the 14 days before symptom onset (exposure period). For deceased or unavailable patients, we interviewed proxies. We did not conduct interviews for cases reported during June 1-September 16, 2018; this period was selected because of specimen availability. Cases were confirmed by testing respiratory specimens with MERS-CoV real-time reverse transcription PCR assays (8) .

We obtained whole-genome sequences from 11 specimens and full or partial spike gene sequences from 5. One virus sequence obtained in 2018 from a patient from the Tabuk region was most similar to those in the 2017 clade; the other 10 virus sequences showed 99.5%-99.9% nt identity and formed a separate clade. This clade included a sequence from a 2018 case-patient from Saudi Arabia who traveled to the United Kingdom. Sequence variability among the 2018 viruses supports the disparate geographic origin of these cases.
