Similarly, multivalent or polyvalent interactions can be defined as specific simultaneous associations of multiple ligands (or epitopes) present on a molecular construct or biological surface that binds in a cooperative way to multiple receptors expressed on a complementary entity.",

In fact, multivalency in Nature is very often expressed by fractal or ''dendritic'' architectures that represent perhaps the most pervasive topologies observed in vegetal and animal kingdoms. 2 Typical examples of these patterns may be found at different scales of dimensional length (meters to microns), and typical examples can be observed in abiotic systems (such as snow crystals, fractal erosions, manganese dendrites in rock) or in the biological world. The reasons for such extensive mimicry of these dendritic topologies at virtually all scales of dimensional length are not entirely clear. However, one might speculate that these evolutionary architectures have been optimized over the past several billion years to provide structures manifesting maximum interfaces for optimum energy extraction/distribution, nutrient extraction/distribution, information storage/retrieval, and adhesive processes. For example, trees use fractal dendritic patterns above and beneath the ground in order to enhance the exposure of their leaves to sunlight to harvest light and maximize the photosynthesis process, and of their roots to collect water from the soil.",

The arterial and central nervous system networks, together with the kidneys and lung structures also consist of a great number of cells growing into dendritic structures in order to gain the largest exchange of material or information with the surrounding tissues. 3 Recently, the implication of dendritic patterns observed under the feet of the gecko has also been clarified to explain the exceptional ability of these animals to climb rapidly up smooth vertical surfaces. 4 Microscopic examinations have shown that a gecko's foot has nearly five hundred thousand keratinous hairs or setae, each composed of an impressive dendritic network of tiny foot hairs ''spatulae.'' Measurements have revealed that one seta is 10 times more effective at adhesion than predicted from maximal estimates on whole animals. Values of the adhesive force support the hypothesis that individual setae operate by weak attractive quantum chemical forces from molecules in each foot-hair interacting through Van der Waals forces with molecules of the surface.",

For HIV-1, several hypothesis have been formulated concerning their role in infection process, and it has been speculated that the N-linked hyperbranched high mannose oligosaccharide (Man 9 GlcNAc 2 ), exposed at the exterior envelope glycoprotein gp120, helps the ''hidden'' virus to escape neutralizing antibodies. 5 Indeed, these glycans are produced by the host cell, and are largely unrecognized by the immune system machinery.",

Indeed, carbohydrates are expressed on the majority of mammalian cell surfaces, and are bound to proteins, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, or conjugated to such cellular constituents as proteoglycans that are entangled in the cell membrane and clustered in multiantennary configurations. In other terms, these oligosaccharides constitute signal transductors between extra-and intracellular media. [6] [7] [8] Hence, these glycosylated structures are responsible for the presentation of target structures for microorganisms, toxins and antibodies, control the half-life of proteins, modulation of protein function, or provision of ligands for specific binding events. In addition, they have recently emerged as antigenic determinants in cell-cell recognition, signaling events, and as ligands for bacterial and viral infections. 9, 10 As such, they constitute the first line of contact for the adhesion and tissue colonization by several pathogens expressing carbohydratebinding proteins (lectins). Conversely, several infectious microorganisms use or escape the immune defense mechanisms by masking important receptors or antigenic determinants by exposing self-carbohydrate structures. As mentioned earlier, the consequences of these ''masking'' events are that the bacterial or viral pathogens are transported to target tissues by self cellular systems.",

            "text": "Despite their critical importance, carbohydrate-protein interactions are paradoxically characterized by rather weak association constants (millimicromolar), with limited specificity and selectivity on a per-saccharide basis. 11, 12 Nature usually compensates for this situation by exposing numerous copies of the same carbohydrate ligands on the extracellular domains of the cells. Consequently, these interactions are transformed into very potent attractive forces, dramatically and naturally reinforced, when multiple ligand copies are presented to similarly clustered receptors. This phenomenon, resulting from a synergic and cooperative effect, is known as the ''glycocluster or dendritic effect,'' 13 and has been initially observed with asialoglycoprotein receptors found on hepatocytes. 14 In its widespread version, it is usually assumed that this effect has its source in the enhanced affinity of a given multivalent glycoside toward a CRD (carbohydrate-recognition domain) by fully occupying one active site at a time.The phenomenon is now widely accepted of having its basis in stabilization by macroscopic ''crosslinking glycocluster effects.'' It has thus come well established that multivalency may offer numerous benefits in terms of affinity and receptor selectivity versus monovalent interaction, and can induce particular clustering organization on the cell surface, notably to provide a strategy for controlling signal transduction pathways within cells. 15 Surprisingly, however, mammals utilize only nine different monosaccharides, which are organized in a massive amount of structural diversity. The variations of anomeric configurations and linkage positioning between saccharides are thus responsible for unraveling several distinctive ''glycocodes.'' 16 As a consequence, the different architectures and topological expressions that result are at the origin of the required high affinity and selectivity for a particular tailored recognition event.",

Numerous key functions of carbohydrates depend on the observed microheterogeneity, added to well-defined cluster organization. In order to study, characterize, understand, and manipulate these critical interactions, striking advances have been made in isolation, purification, structural analyses, and partial or selective degradation processes. Alternatively, chemical or chemoenzymatic synthesis of multivalent carbohydrate ligands is, however, likely to remain the method of choice to afford tailored multivalent architectures developed as effectors or inhibitors of biological mechanisms.

After assessing the bacterial/viral genomes, proteomic analysis, and search for carbohydrate-binding protein homology through bioinformatics, the presence of a carbohydrate-binding protein is then confirmed. For bacterial or viral lectins, the isolated proteins can be labeled with fluorogenic probes. The ligand-binding specificity of the fluorescent lectins is then determined by glycan microarrays such as the one freely accessible from the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (or the like) to identify the best oligosaccharide ''lead.'' 17 The most recent microarrays are usually constituted of approximately 400 natural and synthetic glycans (version 3.10). [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Once essential carbohydrate residues (epitopes) responsible for the biological activity of interest are identified, the lead candidates are then validated by using a range of binding assays such as ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), ELLA (enzyme-linked lectin assay), ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry), SPR (surface plasmon resonance), FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer), X-ray crystallography, and analogous techniques. The relative binding affinities of confirmed oligosaccharide ligands are next evaluated with a panel of simpler oligosaccharides with, ideally, a monosaccharide as the simplest target to ease potential manufacturing purposes and lead optimization that can be obtained by classical QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship).",

In this context, ''artificial glycoforms'' have played crucial roles in our understanding of multivalent interactions, which encompass chelation, 23 receptor clustering and steric stabilization, 24 subsite binding, 25 and statistical rebinding phenomena. 26 Hence, research on synthetic multivalent macromolecules has intensified, giving rise to a myriad of original glycoconjugate structures which constitute high-affinity multivalent ligands that target surface receptors (namely enzymes, lectins, toxins, and such pathogens as viruses or bacteria). These novel nanometersize structures have thereupon shown great potential as potent effectors or inhibitors of surface-surface interactions, including cell-cell and cell-pathogen interactions that occur in biological systems. 27 The following sections illustrate synthetic creativity recently devoted to generating a plethora of multivalent structures used in the biomedical field and with therapeutic goals in particular. Synthetic neoglycoconjugates in which carbohydrate residues are attached to carriers thus present numerous advantages in terms of characterization, structural uniformity, and availability. Hence, presentation of the sugar epitopes as multiple copies on an appropriate scaffold (molecular, dendritic, polymeric) creates a multivalent display that can efficiently mimic the natural mode of affinity enhancement that arises from multiple interactions between the binding proteins and the carbohydrate ligands. In general, the carbohydrate ligands are usually found at the periphery of these macromolecules. Efficient conjugation reactions are required for complete substitution and the structural integrities of the multivalent glycoconjugates are evaluated by such conventional techniques as NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Progress encountered in terms of their synthetic accessibility and efficiency has allowed optimization of their modulation and activity. These factors remain necessary for investigating how these multivalent structures can best influence the targeted binding activity. These investigations are critical for highlighting the potential of multivalent carbohydrate inhibitors as high-affinity ligands or as effectors capable of clustering cell-surface receptors, and may permit generation of structures having tailored biological activities.",

The uniformity of these multivalent neoglycoconjugates is ensured by the controlled arrangement of the constitutional building blocks. To this end, a large panel of linkage functions have been used, but the ones most frequently used are amides, thioureas, and recently 1,2,3-triazoles obtained via dipolar cycloadditions of alkyne and azide precursors through a process now termed ''click chemistry.'' [50] [51] [52] [53] The required functionalities are installed with equal success on either the sugars or on the scaffolds. This particular application has become widely used, since the sugar attachment can be effected with both protected or free sugars. The protecting groups most repeatedly employed on the sugars have been esters because it is usually more difficult to remove large number of ether or acetal-protected sugars (for example, benzyl ethers). Moreover, the lectin-binding efficiency and specificity of multivalent glycoconjugates have been found to be dependent not only on the epitope density but also on the nature of the core and the geometrical characteristics of the multivalent assembly.",

In particular, the design of such systems, including the valency, the introduction of suitable functions and flexible linkers with optimal lengths, has been tailored. Thus, their optimization has rapidly led to the dramatic enhancement of neoglycoconjugate-protein interactions, and has been useful for determining such critical parameters as optimal association geometries, including optimal distances between saccharide epitopes. It is noteworthy that the majority of these scaffolds have also been used for constructing more complex multigeneration glycodendrimers, in particular orthogonally derivatized AB x systems, such as TRIS or gallic acid derivatives.

            "text": "In order to synthesize the target complex glycoclusters, several commercially available or readily derivatized aliphatic scaffolds constituting small multifunctional building blocks have been used to permit rapid access to these multivalent structures (Fig. 2) . Historically, one of the first branched glycoside clusters was based on a readily available AB 3 building block, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (1, TRIS), used by Lee in the late 1970s. 59 Owing to the synthetic advantages in terms of symmetry that ensure orthogonal and rapid functionalization, this building block constitutes an ideal candidate for clustering of saccharides. Hence, 1 and its derivatives have been extensively used by several groups for direct glycoside attachment on hydroxyl groups to generate trivalent clusters. 60 However, although the chemistry of glycocluster synthesis was established, the first such glycoconjugates were generally subject to unfavorable steric factors upon binding to proteins. In this context, K\u00f6tter et al. used extended TRIS derivatives, such as 4-(3-hydroxypropyl)-4-nitroheptane-1,7-diol (2) to prepare highly branched glycomimetics (Fig. 3) . 61 Based on these trivalent building block and peptide-coupling methodologies, the rapid synthesis of tri- (3, 4) and nonavalent mannosylated clusters (5, 6) varying in the chemical characteristics of their spacer moieties and lengths was accomplished. 62 The C-6-linked trimannosylated cluster 4 displayed the highest binding potency toward the type-1 fimbrial lectin from Escherichia coli (FimH), as tested by inhibition of agglutination and ELISA, for which 4 showed an IC 50 of 11 mM. Unfortunately, the corresponding nonavalent dendrons 5 and 6 presented only very poor or no inhibitory potencies. To explain these a priori unexpected results, it has been postulated that the cluster did not present enough hydroxyl groups for efficient interactions with the lectin surface, or did not present hydroxyl or other functional groups in the appropriate orientation for lectin binding. Alternatively, it is well known that the FimH binds mannosides from the nonreducing end.",

The direct conjugation of reducing sugars with diethylenetriamine (7) has been previously reported as allowing efficient and rapid access to divalent carbohydrate derivatives in excellent yields. 63 A few years later, Hayes et al. extended this strategy, describing an elegant one-pot methodology that allowed synthesis of higher valent derivatives through reaction of more-highly functionalized amine clusters with unprotected D-mannose (9) and dimannosides (Scheme 1). 64 Several linkers of different lengths, flexibility, and valency, including di-, tri-, and tetra-valent amines, were readily incorporated to generate multivalent targets in good yields. Notably, tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (8) and pentaerythrityl tetraamine (13) , [prepared from tetrabromide (11) via azide substitution to 12 followed by reduction to 13 with hydrogen on 10% Pd/C], gave the corresponding tri-and tetra-mannoside clusters 10 and 14, respectively, using the free reducing sugar D-mannose (9) . C 3 -Symmetrical glycoclusters, based on a trivalent central core, and exhibiting three and six peripheral mannosides have similarly been prepared by Dubber and Lindhorst, who examined the potential of reductive amination for introducing an aldehyde group of a D-mannose derivative as the carbohydrate ligand on tris(2aminoethyl)amine (8) as the branching core. 65 To this end, the glycoclusters were synthesized from (2-mannosyloxy)ethanal (16) , which was obtained by ozonolysis of Fig. 3 .

However, the instability of the trivalent conjugate arising from autocatalytic deacetylation led the authors to use an excess of aldehyde to ensure complete double N-alkylation. In more-complex carbohydratebased multivalent architectures, this situation may afford undesired partial structures. Scheme 1.

Efficient inhibition of hemagglutination (HAI) by the gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus suis at nanomolar concentration was achieved with these constructs. 72 Synthesis of the most potent tetravalent soluble inhibitors started with 2-bromoethyl galabioside (18) , which was treated with sodium azide followed by O-deacetylation under Zempl\u00e9n conditions and hydrogenolysis to afford 2-aminoethyl galabioside (19) in 80% overall yield. Concerning the central core, the commercially available pentaerythritol tetrabromide 11 was treated with methyl 3-mercaptopropanoate and cesium carbonate to give tetraester 20, which upon hydrolysis led to the corresponding tetraacid 21 in excellent yield. Carboxylic acid activation via formation of a pentafluorophenyl ester, using pentafluorophenol and diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) and subsequent peptide coupling in the presence of amine 19, allowed the synthesis in 18% yield of the desired deprotected glycocluster 22 containing four galabioside residues. Biological studies indicated, through the series of multivalent conjugates, a clear connection between inhibitory efficacy, the number of galabiose units present on the potential inhibitor, and the flexibility of the structures. Interestingly, the tetravalent galabioside was several hundred times more efficient than the monomeric galabioside in inhibiting the agglutination of human erythrocytes by the S. suis bacterium, resulting in complete inhibition at a concentration as low as 2 nM.",

The tetravalent cluster 27 has been efficiently synthesized according to two different synthetic pathways. In the first route, a C 3 hydroxy linker was introduced within the aglycone moiety of 24, and a Williamson ether synthesis with pentaerythritol tetrabromide (11) led to a mixture of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-dentate (26) conjugates, even when an eightfold excess of the corresponding alcohol and forcing reaction conditions were used. In the best case, the protected tetravalent cluster 26 was isolated in 62% yield. To circumvent these difficulties, an alternative strategy was investigated, involving the use of a modified pentaerythritol derivative to serve as a longer spacer-equipped tetraol (23) for the subsequent glycosylation step, using imidate 25. To this end, pentaerythritol was initially perallylated and the extended tetraol 23 was obtained by an hydroboration-oxidation sequence on the double bond in the presence of 9-BBN, NaOH, and H 2 O 2 . Then, the perbenzoylated mannosyl trichloroacetimidate 25 was used as the glycosyl donor for the Lewis acidassisted mannosylation reaction. Deprotection of the resulting tetramer 27 under Zempl\u00e9n conditions afforded the desired cluster 28 in excellent yield. Evaluation of antiadhesive properties of the mannosylated clusters was assessed using ELISA inhibition assays, in comparison to the monovalent reference methyl a-D-mannopyranoside (MeaMan). Results indicated that tetravalent cluster 28 was more than 250 times more potent (thus 62.5 times on a valency-corrected basis) in inhibiting mannose-specific adhesion than MeaMan, with an IC 50 of 12.6 mM. The observed inhibition of bacterial adhesion was most probably explained by the binding of cluster glycosides to single CRDs, which are distributed along type-1 fimbriae, rather than by multivalent binding, which would reflect interaction of the sugar clusters with more than one CRD.",

            "text": "Preliminary biological data on this series of mannosylated clusters indicated interesting potency in the inhibition of agglutination of E. coli x7122 by baker's yeast, with approximately a hundred times improved efficiency than those obtained with monomeric D-mannose. The pioneering observations of Sharon, who first demonstrated the binding preferences of type-1 fimbriated E. coli to mannopyrannosides bearing aromatic aglycones, 80 led to the hypothesis for the existence of ''subsite-assisted aglycone binding.'' 81 Based on these premises, the group of Roy et al. pursued their investigations to enlarge the panel of mannopyranoside clusters via single-step multiple Sonogashira coupling. 82 The necessary carbohydrate precursors were built with either p-iodophenyl, propargyl, or 2-azidoethyl aglycones, whereas the central cores consisted of (di)pentaerythritol-based azide or propargyl derivatives. The first target tetramer (51) was synthesized from p-iodophenyl a-D-mannopyranoside 49, previously prepared from peracetylated a,b-D-mannopyranose by glycosidation with triflic acid as a promoter. Then, Sonogashira coupling between tetrakis(2-propynyloxymethyl)methane (32) and 49, followed by subsequent O-acetyl deprotection of 50 provided the key tetravalent cluster 51 in good yield (Scheme 8). Noteworthy is the fact that those transition metal-catalyzed cross-couplings have been optimized during this study, recommending the use of 5 mol% Pd(PPh 3 ) 2 Cl 2 in the presence of 10 mol% Cu(I) catalyst, piperidine as a base in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), with slow addition of the tetrakis alkyne to prevent homocoupling and degradation. Alternatively, tetramer 55, possessing the reversed linkage functionality, that is, the propargyl group installed on the mannoside residue and the aryl iodide on the pentaerythritol scaffold, was also similarly prepared to investigate the effect of the aryl pharmacophore positioning on binding. In this context, the central tetrakis[(4iodophenyloxy)methyl]methane 53 was efficiently elaborated by nucleophilic substitution of pentaerythritol tetrabromide 11 using p-iodophenol 52 under basic conditions in 78% yield. Treatment of 53 with prop-2-ynyl a-D-mannopyranoside 29 under the optimized Sonogashira coupling conditions just described provided tetramer 54, which upon further O-deacetylation gave unprotected tetramer 55 in 73% yield over two steps. According to the same strategy, but using Et 3 N in DMF at 60 C instead of the foregoing Sonogashira cross-coupling conditions, the corresponding hexavalent cluster 58 was efficiently obtained, using dipentaerythritol derivative 56 and mannoside 29 after conventional Zempl\u00e9n deprotection of 57. Three different types of biological assays were put in place to evaluate the relative binding properties of these tetra-and hexa-valent mannosylated clusters. Initially, the cross-linking abilities of these molecules were investigated by using a kinetic turbidimetric assay (nephelometry), with the tetrameric phytohemagglutinin Con A from Canavalia ensiformis as a model. Significant activity of the glycoclusters was observed when they were used as ligands in interactions with protein receptors, with the rapid formation of cross-linked lattices toward Con A, especially for tetramer 51. In fact, this last example was the best candidate, and it induced an almost quantitative precipitation of the lectin within 2 min. Obviously, clusters having the Scheme 8. Alternative strategy toward the synthesis of hexakis mannopyranosides. 82 alternative triazole heterocycles or the extended series from the Sonogashira coupling were less efficient. These results were rationalized by the authors on the basis of the relative stability of the resulting insoluble complexes, with molecular modeling of tetramer 51 showing that each mannopyranoside residue was at the apex of a tetrahedron in which they were 18.6 and 16.0 \u00c5 apart. This distance could easily accommodate the clustering of four different tetrameric Con A lectins.",

According to this study, tetramer 51 was designated as the best ligand known, with a K D of 0.45 nM (1.8 nM/Man) in the subnanomolar range, corresponding to 1222-fold and 3-fold enhancement over the reference monomer methyl a-D-mannopyranoside and the strongest monosaccharide ligand known (HeptaMan), respectively. Once again, the position of the phenyl ring appeared to be rather important with regard to modulating the activity of tetravalent conjugate 55 (K D \u00bc 273 nM), which differed from 51 only by the inverted alkyne-phenyl ring sequence. These results thus further demonstrated that clusters possessing an aryl moiety in the vicinity of the anomeric oxygen atom showed the best overall qualifications. Conjugates obtained by the click chemistry already described have also been studied. Spatial rearrangement of the hexamer having the triazole rings appeared to be a determinant for affinity, as 42 was nearly five times better than the analogous tetramer 31 (K D of 3 and 14 nM, respectively), thus illustrating the influence of multivalency on this scaffold. The distance between the anomeric oxygen atom and the triazole ring was also a critical factor for affinity.

Given that the mannose-specific lectin Con A induces MT1-MMP expression and mimics biological lectin-carbohydrate interactions, these clusters were tested to evaluate their potential to block Con A activities on MSC. The results indicated that specific tetra-and hexavalent mannoside clusters, especially 51, 55, and 58, reversed Con A-mediated changes in MSC morphology, and antagonized Con A-induced caspase-3 activity and proMMP-2 activation. They also inhibited Con A, but not the cytoskeleton-disrupting agent Cytochalasin-D-induced MT1-MMP cell-surface proteolytic processing mechanisms, and effects on cell-cycle phase progression. The antiproliferative and proapoptotic impact of Con A on the MT1-MMP-glucose-6-phosphate transporter signaling axis was also reversed by these mannosides. In conclusion, this family of mannosylated clusters very effectively inhibited a spectrum of MT1-MMP-mediated cell responses that could be potentially transposed to target tumor-promoting processes.

In this context, Linhardt's group has described a straightforward approach to generate clustered nonnatural n-glycosylamines of a-sialic acid, which are known to be resistant to neuraminidase-catalyzed hydrolysis as opposed to the natural O-glycosides. 87 Influenza viruses use their hemagglutinin to bind to sialic acid residues located on the surface of the host cell and gain entry into the cell. Once the cell is infected, the new virions use their neuraminidases (or sialidases) to escape from the infected cells. Thus, these neuraminidases have been targeted to stop viral infection by blocking the virus inside the infected cells. To this end, a small library of mono-and divalent 1,2,3-triazole-linked sialic acids has been constructed via click chemistry, together with corresponding tetravalent cluster, generated from tetrapropargylated core and a-sialic acid azide. Preliminary neuraminidase-inhibition assays, involving fluorescence measurements induced by the release of 4-methylumbelliferone produced by the hydrolysis of the substrate [2 0 -(4-methylumbelliferyl) N-acetyla-neuraminic acid] by the enzyme [neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (Clostridium welchii)], have been addressed.

Based on these preliminary assumptions, structural analogues of elicitors could result from molecules containing an aromatic core supporting pendant sugar epitopes. By substitution of structural sugar components with benzenoid groups, the rigidity of the polymeric matrix would be preserved with only minimal distortion to the three-dimensional framework.

Persulfurated Glycoclusters.-Recently, two research groups have independently described the synthesis of persulfurated glycoclusters, organized around an aromatic core, that showed interesting lectin-binding activities. in an ongoing research program to study mannose-binding proteins (MBPs) by the systematic syntheses and biological evaluation of multivalent glycomimetic inhibitors against bacterial adhesion, Chabre et al. have described the synthesis via ''click chemistry'' of dense sulfurated glycoclusters containing up to 18 peripheral a-D-mannopyranoside residues (Scheme 13). 103 The synthetic strategy employed hexavalent sulfurated scaffolds 88, initially obtained by thioacetylation of a commercial hexabromomethylated precursor with potassium thioacetate, which was further functionalized with TRIS derivatives 2-bromoacetamido-tris[propargyloxy)methyl]aminomethane (89) . This trivalent moiety was synthesized in an efficient three-step sequence using Boc N-protection of TRIS, followed by propargylation under basic conditions. Quantitative removal of the Boc protecting group under acidic conditions and reaction with bromoacetyl chloride led to precursor 89, which was then treated with hexathioacetate 88 under basic and reductive conditions to afford the octadecapropargylated dendritic scaffold 90 in excellent yield. Its treatment with 2-azidoethyl tetra-O-acetyl-a-D-mannopyranoside (33) using ''click chemistry,'' and subsequent deprotection under standard Zempl\u00e9n conditions provided the densely packed cluster 91 containing 18 peripheral mannoside residues. Initial evaluation against the BclA lectin from Burkholderia cenocepacia by ITC revealed promising candidate ligands having strong affinities (Chabre et al., unpublished results).",

Glycoclusters with a Calixarene Core.-Cyclic polyaromatic calix[n]arenes, owing to their oligomeric nature and shapes that can be tailored by the size of the macrocycle ring and by the nature of the substituents on the lower rim, are attractive multivalent scaffolds with controllable valency. Hence, they constitute valuable candidates onto which glycosides can be exposed at the periphery. More particularly and analogously to CDs, calix [4] arenes blocked in the cone conformation can, to some extent, mimic a small portion of the multiantennary cell surface, presenting a series of glycosylated residues on the exterior of a lipophilic cavity. Moreover, the cavity and the spacers between the upper rim of the calix[n]arenes and the sugar units can be useful for cooperatively binding molecules in a host-guest chemistry process. In this way, the inclusion complexes could be directed toward selected biological targets which specifically recognize the carbohydrate units, with the glycocalix[n]arenes acting as novel types of site-directed molecular delivery systems. They thus provide a versatile platform of well-defined shape for the construction of more-sophisticated structures, including neoglycoconjugates that may be named ''calyx sugars.'' Furthermore, because of their low cytotoxicity, calixarene derivatives have found wide applications in the biomedical field as enzyme inhibitors, anticoagulant and antithrombotic agents, antiangiogenic and anticancer, antiviral, antimicrobial, and antifungal products. 105 Since the first examples of lower and upper rim glycocalixarenes were obtained in 1994 by Marra et al., 106 employing the Mitsunobu reaction or copper(II)-catalyzed glycosylation, the development of efficient synthetic methodologies has allowed the emergence of several examples of O-, N-, or C-glycosyl calix[n]arenes, and these have recently been reviewed (101-106, Fig. 8 ). 107, 108 Severe drawbacks resulting from the absence of suitable spacer arms and low water solubility recorded for the first calix[n]arene-glycoconjugates have been overcome during subsequent years with the use of adapted chemical ligations and suitably derivatized carbohydrates. As example, 2-thio-a-sialosides have been efficiently conjugated to a calix [4] arene scaffold via nucleophilic substitution, providing extended and water-soluble clusters 109 that may exhibit up to 16 dense clustered epitopes. 110 Wittig olefination, 111, 112 Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira cross coupling, 113 click chemistry, 114, 115 and azide-nitrile cycloaddition 116 [118] [119] [120] [121] (which can act as hydrogen-bonding groups) have been described and have afforded elongated nanostructures with tailored spacer arms. These have shown promising applications as drug delivery systems via host-guest supramolecular chemistry.",

In 2005, elegant work disclosed from combined efforts of the Ungaro and Bernardi groups has described the synthesis of a divalent cholera toxin (CT) glycocalix [4] arene ligand (109) having higher affinity than the natural GM1 oligosaccharide 107 (Fig. 9 ). 125 The bacterial CT is produced by toxicogenic strains of the gram-negative bacillus Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, the life-threatening acute diarrhea, that mainly affects third-world populations. This heterohexameric AB 5 complex is composed of structurally independent, catalytically active heterodimeric A (CT-A, enzymatic) and homopentameric B (CT-B, targeting) subunits. This last moiety effects recognition and anchoring to the cell membrane. With 80% sequence homology in common with the heat-labile enterotoxin secreted by some strains of the E. coli bacterium (LT), their mode of action remain similar: both toxins exploit the intrinsic complicated trafficking mechanisms of the host cells to gain access to the cytosol, where they exert their detrimental activity. As a prelude to the infection, once in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract of the human host, the toxins recognize the receptor ganglioside GM1 [bGal1!3bGalNAc1!4(aNeu5Ac2!3)bGal(1!4)b Glc1!1Cer] (107 with an IC 50 of 14 nM for CT)) on the surface of epithelial cells through the B subunits arranged in a pentameric pattern which trigger endocytosis. 126 Acute structural studies and biochemical data concerning the fundamental interaction of GM1 with CT demonstrate the critical role of the two sugars at the nonreducing end of GM1, namely galactose and sialic acid. Taking these specific structural properties into consideration, the rational design of artificial receptors for the toxin as monovalent or multivalent ligands has been envisaged. 127 While preparation of the ganglioside GM1 represents a tedious synthetic challenge, one of the strategies of impeding CT-B/GM1 interactions concerns the design and synthesis of functional and structural 128 In this context, divalent presentation of this promising candidate has been investigated by the authors using the fixed cone conformation of calix [4] arene to allow introduction of the molecules onto the upper rim, and their projection into the same portion of space, thus mimicking, to some extent, a small portion of the natural cellsurface ganglioside. The synthesis of the divalent neoglycoconjugate was based on initial functionalization of the corresponding diacid with an aminated spacer and further introduction of squaric acid moieties.",

Interestingly, high-affinity carbohydrate ligands for both major activating receptors, NKR-P1 and CD69, have been found. More particularly, GlcNAc was recognized as a high-affinity receptor in this study. Furthermore, multivalency through multiantennary, branched GlcNAc-containing structures was found to be crucial for a highly specific recognition and binding event to NKR-P1 and CD69 receptors in vitro. Hence, this study was initiated to determine differences in the binding capability of calix [4] arene-based glycoconjugates to recombinant receptors, as well as their effects on proliferation and cytotoxic cell-effector function. Results indicated that, in the case of NKR-P1, the binding affinity of b-D-GlcNAc-substituted calixarenes carrying two or four sugar units was comparable to that observed with known linear chitooligomers. The influence of GlcNAc substitution of the calixarene skeleton on binding affinity for CD69 receptor was more profound, and the corresponding tetravalent cluster containing thiourea functionalities displayed very potent inhibitory activity, with -logIC 50 as high as 9.3, making it one of the best ligands for this receptor. The use of glycoconjugates with lower valency led to a dramatic decrease of the binding activity. In addition, the immunostimulating activity of the tetravalent glycoconjugate indicated a proliferation and stimulation of natural cytotoxicity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at concentrations of 10 \u00c0 4 and 10 \u00c0 8 M, as observed for lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, at these concentrations, it induced an increase in the spontaneous death of tumor targets. Generally, calyx sugar derivatives were superior to the corresponding dendritic PAMAM-GlcNAc 8 analogues (see next).",

Three propyloxy groups and one pendant P 3 CS unit at the narrow rim block the synthetic core in a rigid cone-shaped conformation, ensuring the preorientation of the antigenic units on the same side with respect to the median plane of the macrocycle. The all-syn orientation of Tn antigens was crucial for better mimicking of the cancer cell surface, while the presence of a glycine spacer should avoid steric hindrance and ensure flexibility, both advantageous in the antigen-immune system interaction. The authors evaluated the immunogenicity of the tetra-Tn construct 116 in mice by using a monovalent glycoconjugate 117 as reference compound. The aim was to investigate the role of the cluster effect in amplifying the antibody production with respect to a single presentation of the Tn antigen unit. In the serum-dilution range considered, mice immunized with tetramer 116 showed a substantial and significant production of antibodies. Even when the concentration of monovalent compound was increased fourfold with respect to the parent monovalent derivative 117, the reactivity elicited by the clustered construct was significantly higher. These data clearly showed that a cluster effect provoked the higher immunostimulating activity of the tetravalent cluster as compared to the monovalent analogue. The authors thus presented still further convincing evidence for a vaccine candidate built on a nonpeptidic platform that induces a more-effective immune response due to the cluster effect and presentation in an optimized arrangement of Tn antigens.

In the solid-phase model system involving VAA lectin and using the absorbed glycoprotein asialofetuin (ASF), the inhibitory potency of the hexa-and octavalent galactoside clusters were 5 and 8 mM, respectively, corresponding roughly to a 100-fold enhancement as compared to free galactose. As demonstrated with solid-phase and cell-binding assays, clustering on macrocycles was also particularly effective toward galectin-4. In fact, among the human lectins, different response patterns were registered, the tandem-repeat-type galectin-4 reacted very sensitively to the presence of these test compounds. The IC 50 value for the lactoside cluster was lowered by a factor of 300-fold relative to the free sugar, when calculating the sugar concentration in the assay.

            "text": "Two general approaches have thus been used to access glycoporphyrins. 139 The first is based on Lindsey's method involving the coupling of pyrroles or dipyrromethanes with glycoaldehydes species through acid-catalyzed condensations, followed by oxidation of the reaction mixture, for instance with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ) (Fig. 11 ). 132 By this strategy, O-, 140,141 C-, and S-linked glycosyl compounds 142 can be obtained, and have been examined in detail. 143 Interestingly, higher valency glycoporphyrins can be obtained by following the pyrrole-aldehyde condensation strategy, generating O-glycosylated porphyrin dimers possessing ether linkages. 144 The second methodology involves direct introduction of glycosylated moieties onto a suitably functionalized meso-arylporphyrin scaffold, accessible from a natural source (protoporphyrin-IX) or by total synthesis. Several O-, 133, 145, 146 S-, 147 and N-glycoporphyrins 148 (125) (126) (127) (128) (129) have thus been prepared (Fig. 12) . Moreover, in order to explore the influence of the clustered peripheral saccharides around the porphyrin scaffolds, and to evaluate their photophysical properties, the synthesis of dodecavalent porphyrins bearing four trivalent glycodendrons via amide ligation (129) has been achieved. 149 PDT is certainly the most promising application for this kind of neoglycocluster. Its concept is based on the concentration of PS in target cells and upon subsequent irradiation with visible light in the presence of oxygen, leading to specific destruction of the target cells or tissues. There is general agreement that the principal mechanism whereby cell destruction occurs involves the disruption of the cellular, mitochondrial, or nuclear membranes by singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) generated by the action of the PS. 150 Photofrin , the first PDT formulation introduced, has been approved in several countries including USA, Canada, Netherlands, France, Germany, and Japan for treatment of bladder, esophageal, gastric, cervical, and lung cancers, and several other diseases. Although Photofrin is effective against a number of malignancies, it is not an ideal PS because of the lack of a well-defined structure, its weak absorbance in the red region of the visible spectrum and the long-lasting skin photosensitivity induced. Mainly because of these drawbacks, several other derivatives have been synthesized with the required peripheral substituents, such as carbohydrate residues to control water solubility, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and affinity-selectivity for cancer cells. 143 Five novel diethylene glycol (DEG)-linked O-and S-galacto or manno-conjugated m-tetraphenyl porphyrins have been prepared and their biological and photobiological properties investigated in vitro against a human retinoblastoma cell line (Y79). 133 Preliminary studies established that human retinoblastoma cells express sugar receptors that exhibit a preferential affinity for galactose and mannose residues. 151 The precursor 5,10,15-m-tri(p-phenol)-20-phenylporphyrin (130) was used for synthesis of all of the glycoconjugates studied (Scheme 16). The trivalent O-glycosylated DEG porphyrins 132a (b-Gal), 132b (a-Gal), and 132c (a-Man) were obtained by treating 130 with the requisite bromo-substituted glycosides (131), followed by deprotection under Zempl\u00e9n conditions, with yields ranging from 22% to 50% over two steps. The corresponding thioglycosylated porphyrin analogues 132d (b-Gal) and 132e (a-Man) were obtained according to a slightly modified strategy involving the preliminary synthesis of the bromo-substituted porphyrin glycol 133 via standard Williamson etherification and final introduction of peracetylated 1-thioglycopyranoses 134 under basic conditions, with improved overall yields of 62-75%.",

The results indicated efficient internalization of the glycoconjugates, preferentially in the membranes of all cytoplasmic organelles, with the extent of uptake dependent upon the nature of the sugar component, its anomeric configuration, and the linker used. An increase in the spacer length linking the tetrapyrrolic ring and the sugar moiety resulted in higher cellular uptake in the case of 132a (O-b-Gal), 132d (S-b-Gal), and 132c (O-a-Man), while a considerable decrease in drug internalization was observed for 132b (O-a-Gal). Hence, these results highlighted the importance of the amphiphilic/lipophilic character of these clusters, indicating that high lipophilicity led to low cellular uptake. The binding affinity toward the sugar-specific receptors on Y79 cells has also been investigated by examining a possible competition effect between the glycoporphyrins and the corresponding glycosylated albumin, indicating inhibition of uptake values of 40-45%, possibly due to cell-sugar-receptor saturation. In addition, their phototoxicity in darkness, evaluated by measurements of the cell survival fraction, was found to be negligible in all cases. High photoactivity was observed for the two a-galacto-manno porphyrins 132b and 132c (LD 50 \u00bc 0.05 and 0.35 mM, respectively) at 514 nm and low fluence (1 J/cm 2 ).

Synthesis of glucosylated porphyrins bearing cationic head-groups. 153 (DMPC) liposome membrane and measured the interaction of the resulting conjugates with Con A lectin. 154 In this context, the authors designed a new family of glycoconjugated PSs bearing only one glycodendron moiety, with variable length for the spacer linking the carbohydrates to the porphyrin scaffold, on the para position of one mesophenyl group (Fig. 13) . Briefly, the Cbz-glycine spacer was introduced via peptide coupling onto the amino function of a trivalent precursor, followed by deprotection of the three terminal carboxylic acid functions of the scaffold and subsequent introduction of aminoethyl a-D-mannopyrannoside derivative through amide ligation. The suitably functionalized aminodendron (after Cbz-hydrogenolysis) was then coupled to 5-benzoic acid-10,15,20-triphenyl porphyrin through an amide linkage, which after standard Odeacetylation afforded the trivalent glycoporphyrins 144 and 145 in good overall yields. In order to evaluate the conditions of incorporation of compounds 144 and 145 into a liposome membrane, the two derivatives were mixed with DMPC in a 1:1 ratio and the mixtures were spread at the air-water interface. Interestingly, incorporation of the elongated conjugate 145 in DMPC induced the formation of larger vesicles than the phospholipid ones (diameter of 218 vs. 185 nm) while compound 144 mixed poorly, leading to smaller and less stable vesicles probably because of repulsive interaction between sugar moieties in the vicinity of the phospholipid headgroups. Moreover, 1 h of contact between the mixed liposome containing 145 and Con A, led to a dramatic increase of the vesicle diameter (up to 2510 nm) and polydispersity was observed. These striking results were postulated to originate from the long spacer, which would increase the mobility of the mannoside moieties and thus facilitate their interactions with the lectin. In addition, the existence of Con A dimers and tetramers at the pH studied, allowed lectin interaction with more than one porphyrin molecules possibly borne by different liposomes. Such multiple interactions would lead to the formation of a network of vesicles bridged by Con A molecules, resulting in a dramatic increase f. Other Aromatic Glycoclusters.-Clearly, access to other type of clusters has also been addressed, for instance, by using more conventional glycosylation strategy. In this context, the synthesis of trivalent b-D-galactoside 149 using stereoselective Lewis acid-catalyzed tris-glycosylation of 1,3,5-benzenetrimethanol (148) with galactal 147 derived from 146 has been described (Fig. 14) . 155 A second example concerned the synthesis of trivalent clusters (150) containing such disaccharides as lactoside as ligands for galectin-1 and -3, 156 or the more-complex a-L-Fucp-(1!4)b-D-GlcNAc for the inhibition of binding of PAII-L lectin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 157 generated by click chemistry between an aromatic tripropargylated core (derived from trimesyl chloride), and the corresponding glycoside azide. Inhibitory properties of 20 mM against galectin-1 were observed for the conjugate 150 in HAI assays. This comprises a 40-fold enhancement as compared to free lactose, and 13.3fold on a per-saccharide corrected basis. In addition, more-unusual macrocyclic scaffolds, such as phthalocyanine (151) have recently emerged to afford dense glycoclusters for which biological relevance remains to be determined. 158,159",

            "text": "Structurally, carbohydrate derivatives are interesting polyfunctional platforms for the synthesis of oligosaccharide mimetics or glycoclusters. The possibility of selective functionalization of the various hydroxyl groups by well-established methodologies, and control of the relative orientation of the branches by configurational and conformational bias, makes these ''full-carbohydrate glycoclusters'' ideally suited for mapping the geometrical requirements for efficient lectin binding. In this context, several synthetic strategies for efficient derivatization of various carbohydrate scaffolds have been described, notably including perallylation of nonreducing mono-or di-saccharides and subsequent ligation of S-glycosides by thioether linkages through photochemically promoted radical addition. 160 Controlled introduction of such desired functionalities as hydroxyl or amino from terminal allyl functions can also permit the construction of glycoclusters through ether, 161 or thiourea linkages (154-156, Fig. 15 ). 160, 162 Systematic studies aimed at evaluating their biological properties against uropathogenic E. coli have been initially addressed by measuring the relative affinities of Con A towards D-glucose-centered mannosylated clusters 152a and 152b and their corresponding analogues, 153, 154, and 155 by a competitive ELLA assay. 160 Hence, the known allyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-allyl-a-and b-D-glucopyranosides were chosen as the core building-blocks for the preparation of pseudosymmetric pentabranched derivatives. The versatile reactivity of the terminal alkene has been exploited in different ways to produce glycoclusters exhibiting a variety of linking functional groups, such as thioether, ether, and thiourea. With this strategy, the higher-valent D-glucose-centered glycocluster 155 [160] [161] [162] has also been obtained. The IC 50 values of the pentavalent clusters 152a and 152b (27 and 31 mM, respectively) were indicative of strong Con A affinity relative to the reference methyl a-D-mannopyranoside, corresponding to a 6.4 and 5.5-fold enhancement on a per mannoside basis. A tetravalent analogue (153) containing an aglyconic oxygen atom presented identical avidity, indicating that multivalent presentation through four branches is sufficient to elicit a cluster effect. In sharp contrast, replacement of the 1-thiomannose wedges with a-D-mannopyranosylthioureido units virtually abolished any multivalent or statistic effects, along with a dramatic decrease of binding affinity. Alternatively, the 15-valent ligand 155, possessing classical O-glycosidic linkages, was a very efficient inhibitor of the Con A-yeast mannan association (IC 50 of 18.5 mM). However, the valency-corrected relative potency was about one-half that of the pentavalent derivatives. Those results illustrated the potential of carbohydrates as multivalent scaffolds for glycocluster synthesis and underlined the importance of careful design of the overall architecture in optimizing glycocluster recognition by specific lectins. As mentioned in the introduction, the TRIS scaffold is NOT optimized for simultaneous binding without the utilization of elongated spacers that allow several lectins to bind the maximum accessible sugar ligands.",

The construction of these multivalent glycoclusters involves first the introduction of propargyl or azide functionalities on such mono-or oligo-saccharides as maltoside or maltotrioside as central cores and subsequent reaction with glycosylated ligands containing the complementary functionality (157-159, Fig. 16 ). 163, 164 A remarkable example of a biologically relevant D-glucose-centered glycocluster has been achieved by Kitov et al., who designed an oligovalent, water-soluble carbohydrate ligand named STARFISH having subnanomolar inhibitory activity toward Shiga-like toxin I (SLT-I). 23 Shiga toxin (Stx) and Shiga-like toxins (SLTs or VTs (Verotoxins) are ribosome-inactivating proteins that act as N-glycosylases, cleaving several nucleobases from the RNA, and thereby halting eukaryotic protein biosynthesis. Infection by bacteria that produce SLTs results in serious gastrointestinal and urinary tract disorders, and is known to cause a potentially lethal disease, the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), that may result in kidney failure. Stx is produced by Shigella dysenteria, whereas SLTs are produced by the Shiga toxigenic group of E. coli (STEC), including serotype O157:H7 and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). The E. coli toxins can be further divided into SLT-I and SLT-II having conserved structures in the binding sites, and the SLT-II edema variant (SLT-Iie). Like CT, SLTs belong to a family of bacterial enterotoxins harboring a hexameric AB 5 structure, where A denotes a cytotoxic enzyme located above the center of one face of the B 5 -subunit, which represents a symmetrical homopentameric lectin-like carbohydrate-recognizing complex having a doughnut shape that facilitates delivery and entry of the A component into the cell of the host. 165 The SLT-I is virtually identical both in structure and mechanism of action to the toxin expressed by S. dysenteria, having similar B-subunits and differing only in one residue (Ser45 vs. Thr45) in their A-subunits. The in vivo receptor of Stx and SLTs is the trisaccharide portion (P k ) of the neutral glycolipid, globotriosylceramide (GbOse 3 or Gb 3 , aGal-(1-4)bGal(1-4) bGlc(1-1)ceramide), present in greater amounts on the surfaces of kidney glomerular endothelial cells, to which the renal toxicity of Stx may be attributed (Fig. 17) .",

            "text": "When the crystallographic structures of the protein or carbohydrate-ligated proteins are known, it is possible to model multivalent oligosaccharide inhibitors. As mentioned, the SLTs possess five noncovalent B-subunits per molecule and each subunit presents three carbohydrate-binding domains. Therefore, oligovalency ''tailored'' to the structure of the B-subunit pentamer offers the best opportunity for designing higher affinity inhibitors, as 15 binding sites are symmetrically arranged across the toxin surface that engages the cell membrane. Thus, highly selective, potent binding of SLTs to Gb 3 is mainly attributed to the multiple interaction of the B-subunit pentamer with the trisaccharide moiety on Gb 3 . On the basis of these facts, several SLTs antagonists in which this trisaccharide moiety was combined using various dendritic core structures have been reported. Among these, the foregoing study in SYNTHESIS OF MULTIVALENT NEOGLYCOCONJUGATES particular afforded spectacular results and effectiveness in neutralizing SLTs infection. Hence, the use of the crystal structure of the B 5 subunit of E. coli 0157:H7 SLT-IB in conjunction with an analogue of its carbohydrate receptor allowed the design of tailored multivalent glycocluster 160 bearing 10 peripheral functionalized P k residues. Structurally, this decavalent cluster, named STARFISH, comprised a radially symmetrical star-shaped carbohydrate backbone (D-glucose) with pairs of Gb 3 trisaccharides at the tip of each arm, ideally spaced and oriented to be simultaneously engaged by each the B-subunits and thus to permit pentavalent interaction with SLTs. To achieve this display of tethered ligands, a glucose molecule was chosen as the central core for adequate pentavalent presentation, via its derivatization as pentaallyl ethers, free-radical reaction with thioglycolic acid, and subsequent chain elongation of the radial arms. Each of them was designed to span $ 30 \u00c5 from the central core of the toxin and the tether was adapted to bridge binding sites 1 and 2 on each B-subunit. ELISA and solid-phase inhibition assays indicated the highest molar activity of any inhibitor reported, with subnanomolar inhibitory activity against STL-I and II (IC 50 of 0.4 and 6 nM, respectively), thus being 1-10-million-fold higher than that of monovalent ligand. Furthermore, the ability of the inhibitors to protect host cells against a lethal dose of SLT-I in culture could be determined by using Vero cells. Cytotoxicity assays indicated that STARFISH inhibitor 160 provided effective protection of Vero cells cultured in the presence of SLT-I (IC 50 of 1.19 mM) and SLT-II (IC 50 of 1.58 mM), even over a 2-day coincubation period. Interestingly, the crystal structure showed that one STARFISH molecule bound to not just one but to two B-subunit pentamers. Instead of binding sites 1 and 2, the tethered P k -trisaccharides of STAR-FISH bound to two B-subunit monomers from separate toxin molecules. As, in the experiment, the concentration of STARFISH was sufficient to form a 1:1 complex, it was suggested that the formation of a 2:1 sandwich must be thermodynamically favored, as for the CT. Extended investigations have been made by the same group in order to circumvent the differentiation of SLT-I and SLT-II during biological studies. In fact, STARFISH 160 protected mice when it was injected subcutaneously in admixture with a lethal dose of SLT-I but not SLT-II, and it also reduced the distribution of 125 I-STL-I but not 125 I-STL-II to the murine kidney and brain. Modification of the nature and length on the linkage between the oligosaccharide component and the backbone (thereby increasing the flexibility of the tether) was then necessary to protect against the more-toxic SLT-II. 166 Despite a considerable decrease in its inhibitory activity in the solid-phase inhibition assays (with an IC 50 of 300 nM, corresponding to a $ 50-fold increase compared with 160), an equivalent decrease in performance of the so-called DAISY (161) in the more challenging SLT-I and SLT-II verocytotoxicity-neutralization assays was not apparent (Fig. 18 ). Subcutaneous injection of 161 protected mice against oral challenge with SLT-I and also STL-II-producing STEC. Interestingly, 161 did not interfere with the ability of the murine immune system to produce SLTs-specific protective antibodies.",

The monosubstituted hexavalent b-CD mannocluster showed a strong cluster effect in the inhibition of Con A binding to yeast mannan, with an IC 50 of 10 mM that constituted up to a 22-fold increase on a molar basis as compared to monovalent derivative. In addition, the CD derivatives exhibited extremely high water solubility, more than 20-fold higher as compared to the parent CD (15 mM). Furthermore, the potential utility of such systems in active sugar-directed drug delivery to specific saccharide receptors on biological surfaces has been investigated. Thus, the cavity of b-CD was used to carry the anticancer drug Taxotere, for which the water solubility was greatly improved by the construct. Up to 4.5 and 4.7 g/L of Taxotere was solubilized in 25 mM aqueous solutions of a trivalent mannocyclodextrin derivative at 25 C, corresponding to more than a 1000-fold solubility enhancement as compared to the water solubility of the isolated drug (0.004 g/L). 180 ",

An emerging example of this irregular situation is the recognition, binding, and transport of the hyperbranched high-mannose oligosaccharide (Man 9 GlcNAc 2 ) present on HIV gp120 by dendritic cells, with the ensuing transport of the ''hidden'' virus particles to lymph nodes. Danishefsky's group using 14-residue cyclic peptides bearing b-turns provided by two D-Pro-L-Pro sequences appended at the extremity of the scaffolds (181), elegantly constructed the potent HIV-gp120 carbohydrate antigen 182, which was strongly recognized by the human swapped and protective IgG 2G12 antibody (Fig. 23 ). 188 The cyclic peptide containing two or three handles for glycan attachment, together with a single cysteine residue for further carrier protein or biological marker conjugation, was built on a prolinated trityl resin using solid-phase peptide chemistry, while the synthetic oligosaccharide Man 9 GlcNAc 2 -NH 2 , prepared by amination of the reducing sugar, 189 was attached to the aspartic acid residues properly positioned onto the cyclic peptides 181a or 181b using the Lansbury aspartylation procedure, thus providing dimer and trimer (182) , respectively. 190 Studies with SPR indicated that the control peptide lacking the saccharide portion, as well as the monovalent glycopeptides, showed no measurable response, thus confirming the importance of multivalent binding event in this critical recognition process. The corresponding divalent and trivalent glycopeptides proved to be strong ligands against the 2G12 bound surface, indicating topographical homology with the natural gp120 structure. With the confirmed antigenicity of both glycopeptides, the authors then used the sulfhydryl anchor of the divalent antigen for its attachment to the highly immunogenic, maleimido-derived outer membrane protein complex (OMPC) carrier from Neisseria meningitidis. The conjugate addition, performed at near-neutral pH, afforded a vaccine candidate bearing $ 2000 copies of the carbohydrate antigen which was also recognized by 2G12 antibody in an ELISA assay using 181b X = Asp, R = CH 2 CO 2 H 181a X = Ala, R = Me either gp160 or the glycoconjugate as coating antigens. Horse radish peroxidaseconjugated antihuman IgG (HRP-IgG) evidenced detection of the binding event. The results indicated that, while both antigens could bind to the 2G12 antibody, the natural gp160 bound more efficiently. The immunological properties of the semisynthetic vaccine are presently under investigation.",

            "text": "For instance, Burke et al. investigated a templated ligand array based on a conformationally defined macrocyclic scaffold on which three mannoside residues, appended through a solubilizing linker, were displayed (Fig. 25) . 192 The C 3 -symmetric hydropyran cyclooligolide core was previously obtained according to an iterative multistep synthetic sequence notably involving key-step macrolactonization under Keck-Steglich high dilution conditions. 193 In particular, the template rigidity conferred a specific orientation of saccharide residues such that they emanate from a single face. In addition, molecular-modeling studies predicted a maximum separation between mannose residues of approximately 35 \u00c5 . Given that the binding sites within the Con A tetramer are separated by 65-70 \u00c5 , the trivalent ligand 187 could not simultaneously occupy two mannose-binding sites within the tetrameric lectin. Therefore, it could be used to explore mechanisms of multivalent ligand binding in the absence of the chelate effect. SPR competition-binding assay with Con A indicated the absence of nonspecific interactions induced by the template, and highlighted the fact that 187 promoted rather than inhibited binding of Con A to the mannosesubstituted lipid surface. The data suggested that the glycocluster was able to bind two or three Con A tetramers simultaneously and to form soluble clusters with high avidity for immobilized ligands. Assay by FRET showed the reversibility of the phenomenon, and corroborated the fact that clustering of Con A by 187 did not depend on subsequent precipitation or cluster binding to a surface. In addition, this synergistic interaction favored the formation of a Con A cluster rather than the formation of a one-to-one complex of Con A and the trivalent ligand. Another striking example has been provided which exploited cucurbit[n]urils (CB [n], n \u00bc 5-10) (188), a family of macrocyclic cavitands comprising n glycoluril units as multivalent scaffolds for carbohydrates. 194 They possess a hydrophobic cavity accessible through two identical carbonyl-fringed portals, and can form stable host-guest complexes with a wide range of guest molecules. Hence, CB[6]-based clusters 189a-c, presenting an average of 11 carbohydrate moieties attached to the periphery (189a, b-glucose; 189b, b-galactose; and 189c a-mannose, respectively) were prepared via photoreaction of (allyloxy) 12 CB [6] (188) with corresponding acetylthioglycosides, followed by standard O-deacetylation (Fig. 25 ). In particular, the mannoside cluster 189c presented strong avidity for Con A and a 1100-fold excess of Me-aMan was necessary for the disruption of its cross-linking interaction with the lectin. ITC confirmed this affinity and indicated that 189c behaved predominantly as a trivalent ligand to the lectin with a binding constant K \u00bc (1.9AE0.2)\u00c210 \u00c0 5 M \u00c0 1 , which was 25 times higher than that for Me-aMan. The authors further exploited the cavity provided by such conjugates to incorporate, through host-guest interactions, the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-spermine conjugate 190 in order to estimate their potential as drug-delivery vehicles. Targeted delivery experiments in vitro were thus carried out with the (FITC)-spermine derivative as a fluorescent probe as well as a drug model, and the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells that overexpressed galactose receptors as target cells. Intracellular translocation has been estimated by confocal microscopy, and the results confirmed internalization of the CB[6]-galactose-(FITC)-spermine complex 190b via galactose-mediated endocytosis. This study demonstrated the potential of glyco-cucurbituryl derivatives as targeted drug-delivery system and paved the way to other interesting therapeutic applications.",

A semirigid core, having ''fingers'' projecting outward in the direction of the receptor's binding sites and fitting perfectly into the active site have been assembled.",

A few years later, the same group optimized the structure, incorporating five copies of the more potent m-nitrophenyl a-D-galactoside (MNPG) derivatives rather than five copies of b-D-galactose. 199 The $ 100-fold higher single-site affinity enhancement of MNPG for the binding site of the toxin relative to galactose was found to yield a proportionate increase in the affinity and IC 50 measured for the respective pentavalent constructs. Indeed, ELISA experiments involving CTB pentamer revealed an IC 50 of 0.9 mM for 201 (R \u00bc R 2 ), corresponding to about an 18-fold affinity enhancement over 200 (R \u00bc R 1 ). These results demonstrated that improved affinity for a single-site ligand confers a parallel improvement in the affinity of a pentavalent construct presenting five copies of the same ligand. Furthermore, from DLS studies and crystallographic data, it resulted that a 1:1 CTB/201 complex was the major mode of association in solution between the ligand and the toxin. The lead structure 201 was then affined with the incorporation of guanidine-bridged poly(ethylene glycol)s of various lengths, in order to enhance its water solubility. Thus, compound 202 (R \u00bc R 3 ) having an optimized effective Fig. 30 . The best ligands against E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin. [198] [199] [200] [201] dimension for strong affinity, displayed an IC 50 of 6 nM, being lower than that of the natural receptor GM1, and which represented the first multivalent ligand based on a simple galactoside having nanomolar affinity against CTB. 200 During parallel investigations, spectacular improvement has been observed with the construction of a family of complex ligands having five flexible arms, each ending with a bivalent ligand 203 (R \u00bc R 4 ). 201 ELISA tests revealed that the improved decavalent derivatives were significantly more potent, showing affinities for CTB an order of magnitude better than the corresponding nonbranched ligands. More precisely, a more than 10 6 -fold enhancement in inhibitory power over the monovalent ligand was achieved with the best decavalent candidate 203 (with n \u00bc 4) with an IC 50 of 40 nM, a value that lies in the same range as the IC 50 of the natural receptor (50 nM). Dynamic lightscattering studies demonstrated the formation of concentration-dependent unique 1:1 and 1:2 ligand-toxin discrete complexes in solution, with no sign of formation of large aggregates. Crystallographic studies confirmed that the decavalent inhibitor resulted in a ''sandwich arrangement'' of two B pentamers facing each other and bridged by the ligand. The improvement in IC 50 displayed by the decavalent ligands might be attributed to a substantial difference in affinity between the galactose fragment within the pentavalent ligand and the rather short, nonspanning bivalent galactose moiety present in the decavalent ligand.",

They have generated much enthusiasm and numerous research efforts during the past few years. 206 Hence, the chemical and physical features of C 60 , also named Buckminsterfullerene, the most representative example among the fullerenes, have been extensively explored. Their intrinsic properties such as their size, hydrophobicity, threedimensionality, and electronic properties have made them extremely promising nanostructures, offering interesting features at the interface of various scientific disciplines, ranging from material sciences 207 to biological and medicinal chemistry. [208] [209] [210] In order to demonstrate and illustrate their attractive potential in the foregoing applications, an array of studies has been recorded, including cytotoxicity investigations on both unmodified and functionalized fullerenes. Initial results have indicated that these novel and fascinating architectures were not carcinogenic when applied to the skin, nor did they affect the proliferation and the viability of cells when they are internalized. Hence, despite an observed dose-dependent toxicity phenomenon reported for certain related derivatives, the early observations indicate great promise for applications in DNA cleavage, PDT, enzymatic inhibition, antiviral, antibacterial, and antiapoptotic activity. [209] [210] [211] However, the total lack of solubility in aqueous or physiological media is a severe drawback for their quick and efficient development as suitable carriers. In order to circumvent the natural repulsion of fullerenes for water, several methodologies have been adopted, including their entrapment into tailored microcapsules, their suspension with the help of cosolvents, and their chemical derivatization, notably their introduction onto peripheral solubilizing appendages. Furthermore, it has been shown that the multivalent presentation of polar groups around the fullerene spheres can prevent clustering phenomena in reasonably dilute solutions and consequently increase the hydrosolubility of the resulting conjugates. In this context, a variety of chemical functionalities have been utilized to increase both the hydrophilicity (with groups such as OH, CO 2 H, NH 2 , quaternary ammonium, and CD) and to prepare novel compounds possessing biological and pharmacological activity.",

Moreover, this methodology has been advantageously adapted for synthesis of C 60 derivatives containing a 6-(b-D-glycopyranosylamino)pyrimidin-4-one unit. 215 Alternative strategies utilizing the initial introduction of suitable chemical functionality onto the fullerene have been adopted by several research groups, allowing conjugation of the saccharides with complementary functions in the final synthetic steps. This approach has led to improved flexibility with the chemical functions on the carbohydrate moieties, especially the anchoring ones, and a better control on the number of attached saccharide residues. Another example has been provided by Ito et al., who described the use of methanofullerene derivatives as powerful and stable precursors for glycofullerenes. 217 Their study was based on the use of [60] fullerenoacetyl chloride (227), obtained from the tert-butyl [60] fullerenoacetate derivative 226, which had been prepared in 56% yield by treatment of corresponding stabilized sulfonium ylides 225 with C 60 . 218 Subsequent transformation with p-TsOH in toluene gave [60] fullerenoacetic acid, which was directly converted into the corresponding acyl chloride 227 by using thionyl chloride.

Multivalent Structures.-Divalent hybrid glyconanostructures have been prepared via the [3\u00fe2]-cycloaddition reaction between 2-azidoethyl glycopyranoside derivatives and C 60 . The first example described a strategy for synthesis of [60] fullerenols carrying mono-and bis-a-D-mannopyranosides (Scheme 21). 221 The methodology was based on initial thermal coupling of 2-azidoethyl mannopyranoside (33) and an equimolar amount of C 60 in chlorobenzene, giving a mixture of two isomeric monoadducts (a-D-mannosyl [5, 6] -azafulleroid, 233a, and a-D-mannosyl [6,6]-aziridinofullerene, 233b) 222 and a bismannosylated adduct 234. Subsequent simultaneous deacetylation and polyhydroxylation were then conducted in the presence of tetra-nbutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) in aqueous NaOH, to afford deprotected mono- (236) and bisfullerenols (237) with an average of heterogeneously distributed 29 OH groups per C 60 . Biological evaluations, notably involving lectin-induced HAI assay with an a-D-mannoside-specific lectin (Con A), revealed that mono-and bis-mannosyl fullerenols exhibited diminished activity for both binding to Con A and aggregating erythrocytes as compared to the activity of mannosylated neoglycopolymers. A few years later, a similar grafting methodology was used to generate a series of mono-and bis-sugar-pendant [60] fullerene derivatives prepared from a variety of carbohydratelinked azides. 223 The phototoxicity of the corresponding deprotected glycoconjugates was evaluated for potential applications in PDT. Substantial production of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) under laser irradiation (355 nm) was observed for both adducts, notably for the monosugar derivatives, which shown a better photosensitizing ability. In addition, in vitro studies involving HeLa cells confirmed their photocytotoxicity and indicated a carbohydrate-dependent efficiency. In line with previous work, another application has been proposed which described the formation of stable selfassembling structures in aqueous solvents from the deprotected bis(a-D-mannopyranosyl)- [60] fullerene conjugate 235. 224 The diameters of the resulting large aggregates (100-300 nm), resembling bilayer vesicles or unadulterated liposomes, were determined by DLS and AFM. These supramolecular structures were able to encapsulate Ba 2\u00fe ions and such organic molecules as Acridine Red, constituting for instance, promising candidates for slow drug delivery. The ability of these mannofullerenes to bind to a mannoside-recognizing lectin (Con A) was also investigated. Colloidal suspensions of the stable self-assembling structure 235 presented higher blocking activity than the two monoadducts, with an interesting submicromolar MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) value in a lectin-induced hemagglutination assay. This strong protein-binding activity has been rationalized by the authors by the fact that the fullerene scaffold allowed a spatial arrangement of the bis(mannopyranoside) moiety that could mimic 3,6-branched a-D-trimannoside, a natural ligand of Con A. Unfortunately, this methodology often generates mixture of diversely substituted adducts, difficult to separate, in rather low yields and presenting only very limited solubility in water.",

            "text": "An alternative synthetic approach, first developed by Bingel 225 allowed the efficient nucleophilic cyclopropanation of fullerenes via their reaction with bromomalonate derivatives in the presence of base. This approach, the most reliable method for the synthesis of functionalized methanofullerenes, combined the advantages of mild reaction conditions, good yields, and exclusive formation of [6, 6] -bridged adducts. Furthermore, the degree of functionalization could be controlled by the stoichiometry of the malonate derivatives for access to higher adducts in one step (bis up to hexakis). This methodology suffers, however, from the complexity of preparing the bromomalonates, often generating mixtures of mono-and di-bromo derivatives with similar chromatographic properties. An optimized methodology has then been proposed by Camp and Hirsch that avoids the use of bromomalonates by direct treatment of the fullerene with malonates in the presence of CBr 4 (or I 2 ) and DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4 .0]undec-7-ene). 226 It has been exploited in collaborative work describing the synthesis of amphiphilic glycofullerodendrimers and their incorporation into Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett films (Scheme 22). 227 The synthesis of the first C 60 -dendrimer conjugate containing one glycodendron headgroup started from the treatment of C 60 with diethyl malonate (238) in the presence of CBr 4 and DBU to furnish the monoadduct 239a in 57% yield (Scheme 22). A clean formation of 239b from its diester 239a was accomplished in toluene with a 20-fold molar excess of NaH at 60 C. 228 The resulting bismalonate derivative 244 was then engaged in double-Bingel macrocyclization with C 60 to afford the C s -symmetrical cis-2 bisadduct 245 in 22% yield. Subsequent selective cleavage of the tert-butyl ester under acidic conditions provided the desired diacid core 246, 230 which was finally treated with the glycodendron 240 under the foregoing conditions to yield glycofullerodendrimer 247 exhibiting six peripherally protected glucopyranoside residues. With this work, the authors highlighted the preponderant role of the bulky glycodendron headgroups on C 60 that formed a compact insulating layer around the carbon sphere, avoiding the general propensity of amphipilic fullerene derivatives to aggregate irreversibly. Hence, both amphiphilic fullerenes 241 and 247 were able to form stable, ordered monomolecular Langmuir layers at the air-water interface and showed reversible behavior in successive compression-expansion cycles. In addition, the monolayers were transferred successfully as X-type Langmuir-Blodgett films onto quartz slides for anticipated applications as biosensors.",

They also described their supramolecular assembly in aqueous solution. 231 In this context, bis(a-D-mannopyranosyl)fullerene (250) has been synthesized by a sequence involving the bis-(a-D-mannopyranosylated malonate) 248. This resulted from a peptide-coupling reaction between the corresponding 2-aminoethyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-a-D-mannopyranoside, quantitatively obtained from corrersponding azide derivative 33 after Staudinger reduction, and malonic acid, in 56% yield. The subsequent nucleophilic cyclopropanation of C 60 with 248 under typical Bingel-Hirsch conditions, followed by O-deacetylation of 249 under Zempl\u00e9n conditions afforded fully deprotected [6, 6] -monoadduct 250 in an overall isolated yield of $ 6%. It is noteworthy that the protected architecture, presenting robust amide linkages around the malonate anchor points, tolerated basic cleavage of the acetyl protecting groups without side reactions or decomposition of the fullereno sugar. Scheme 23. Synthesis of a bismannoside-C 60 adduct using the Bingel-Hirsch procedure. 231 Unfortunately, its relatively low solubility in aqueous media compelled the authors to enhance the number of peripheral saccharidic units. Toward this goal, they developed fullerene glycoconjugate 258, where two dendritic branches terminated by six deprotected a-D-mannopyranosyl building blocks were connected through two adjacent imino bridges to the all-carbon framework (Scheme 24). Moreover, in this type of C 60 adduct, which constitutes a 1,9-dihydro-1a-aza-1(2)a-homo(C60-I h ) [5, 6] fullerene derivative, the entire 60-p-electron system of the fullerene core was retained. For its preparation, AB 3 glycosylated dendritic building blocks were first synthesized by preliminary protection of Newkome's dendron 251 232 with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl), then treatment with formic acid for orthogonal and quantitative cleavage of the tert-butyl ester to give triacid 252 upon which, peptide coupling with 2-aminoethyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-a-D-mannopyranoside 253 provided trimannoside 254 in 83% yield. Selective removal of the Cbz protecting group by hydrogenolysis gave the corresponding amine in quantitative yield, which was engaged without further purification with a suitable linker bearing a terminal azide group, namely 2-[2-(2azidoethoxy) ethoxy]acetyl fluoride (255) , in the presence of DMAP in CH 2 Cl 2 to provide the azido oligo(ethylene glycol)-terminated glycodendron 256 in 94% yield. Its subsequent thermal coupling with C 60 in toluene afforded a mixture of mono-and bisglycodendron adducts. Separation and purification by column chromatography gave regioselectively the twofold cluster-opened diazabishomofullerene adduct 257, Scheme 24. Direct anchoring of azide-bearing mannosylated dendrons onto C 60 . 231 but in only 8% yield. Finally, quantitative deprotection under standard Zempl\u00e9n conditions provided 258. This C 60 glycoconjugates having six peripheral mannoside residues is the most water-soluble fullereno sugar (> 40 mg/mL) known. Its amphiphilic nature, with a cone-shaped structure, triggered the formation of small supramolecular aggregates in aqueous solutions (observed in DOSY NMR and corroborated by TEM investigations), as uniform spherical micelles with an extremely narrow size distribution. These micellar sugar balls, with a diameter below 5 nm, furnish an original arrangement of saccharides that opens the gate to new biomedical applications.",

SMe 2 . The desired fullerene cyclopentadiene bearing tetrahydropyranyl-protected thiophenol moieties (260) 95% yield. Subsequent installation of five saccharide moieties via a nucleophilic substitution reaction in aqueous THF with 6 equivalents of sodium hydroxide and 2-bromoethyl glycopyranosides 263a-c afforded the fullerene glycoconjugates a-Dmannoside 264, b-D-glucoside 265, and b-D-galactoside 266, in 73%, 79%, and 87% yields, respectively. Despite the generality of this methodology for simple carbohydrate derivatives, its application for introduction of larger oligosaccharides via direct nucleophilic substitution produced side products and led to lower yields. To circumvent this situation, the same authors described the optimization and adaptation of this methodology for the quantitative synthesis of fullerenes bearing five saccharides, such as the glucose 270a, maltotriose 270b, and globotriaosylceramide Gb3-P k trisaccharide 270c derivative (Scheme 26). 235 Hence, more-sophisticated nanometer-scale pentavalent molecular architectures could be readily prepared by use of the key pentaalkynylfullerene intermediate 268 obtained directly by the derivatization of fulleropentathiol 261 with 7-bromohept-1-yne 267 in 73% yield under the foregoing conditions. Click chemistry allowed efficient conjugation of the functionalized saccharide moieties with a terminal complementary azide function (269a-c) on the pentaalkynylated core 268 under mild conditions. Hence, in the typical presence of CuBr.SMe 2 and DIPEA in Me 2 SO, deprotected fullero-derivatives 270a-c were obtained in nearly quantitative yields through optimized conditions involving controlled heating or microwave irradiation.",

            "text": "CNTs are members of the fullerene structural family and consist exclusively of carbon atoms arranged in a series of condensed benzene rings, organized in graphitic sheets that are rolled up into a tubular structure. 236 CNTs made up of a single graphene layer wrapped into a cylindrical structure constitute single-walled CNTs (''SWNTs''), whereas multiwalled CNTs (''MWNTs'') are generated from a central tubule of nanometric diameter and surrounded by several graphitic layers spaced by a distance of about 0.34 nm. Most commonly, the diameter range of CNTs varies between 0.4 and 2 nm for SWNTs and between 1.4 and 100 nm for MWNTs, while their length is in the range of micrometers (up to 100 nm). Moreover, CNTs typically form bundles that are entangled together in the solid state, giving rise to a highly complex ''spaghetti'' network. 237 Intrinsically, CNTs possess very interesting and unique physicochemical properties such as: high surface area, ordered structure with a high aspect ratio, ultralight weight, excellent chemical stability, high electrical conductivity, high thermal conductivity, and metallic or semiconducting behavior according to the arrangement of the hexagon rings along the tubular surface. For these reasons, these nano-objects have raised great enthusiasm and expectations in many different applications, including material, biological, and medical sciences. 238 More particularly, their intriguing structures and properties have led to the emergence of functionalized CNTs as new biologically relevant alternatives for therapeutic and diagnostic applications, 239 including their use as vectors for delivery of therapeutic molecules 240 (plasmid gene delivery, 241 peptides/proteins, 242 and antibiotics 243 ). Indeed, prior to become viable and effective nanomedicines, the toxicological and pharmacological profiles of CNTs had been determined by several research groups and reviewed by Lacerda et al. 244 As with biological studies on fullerenes, functionalized CNTs offer potential as nanomedicines, whereas nonfunctionalized CNTs usually contain amorphous carbon, carbon nanoparticles, and residues from metal catalysts, regardless of the procedures for their production. Indeed, their inherent hydrophobic properties, associated with their innate propensity to form bundles via aggregation through van der Waals forces, constitute major technical barriers for their utilization in medicinal applications. To overcome these drawbacks, modification of their surface is typically achieved by adsorption, electrostatic interaction, or covalent bonding of different molecules and chemical procedures that render them more soluble in biological media. 245 Such modifications generally improve the water solubility of CNTs, decrease the aggregation phenomenon, and transform their biocompatibility and biodistribution profiles.",

The resulting densely attached sugars, as pendant groups on the CNT hybrids, serve as multivalent carbohydrate ligands and show potential biological activities as well as behaving as glycoconjugate polymers. Multivalent presentation of saccharidic residues has been realized via noncovalent stabilization processes through favorable hydrophobic, p-p stacking or electrostatic interactions, or via sidewall-or defect-targeted covalent functionalization.

Glyconanotubes from Noncovalent Interactions.-The initial challenge of obtaining SWNTs soluble in organic or aqueous media by a supramolecular approach was motivated by the necessity for retaining their intrinsic physical properties without affecting the all-carbon scaffold. The first successful example was realized through noncovalent functionalization by wrapping synthetic and biocompatible water-soluble polymers around the SWNTs. The formation of supramolecular complexes in solution between SWNTs and the preformed helical structure of starch (a polymer composed of the linear amylose and branched amylopectin) has been investigated. 246 The enhanced water solubility of the supramolecular complexes was significant, and further investigations suggested that the presence of the preformed helical structures of amylose may not be required. 247 Other studies examplifying complexation of the SWNTs with CDs have also yielded some interesting results. 248 As a natural extension of these preliminary studies, promising applications in the area of glyconanotechnology have been directed toward artificial glycoconjugates carrying bioactive carbohydrates, densely distributed onto CNT platforms, to mimic cell-surface oligosaccharides. A striking example describes a biomimetic surface modification of CNTs, using glycosylated polymers designed to mimic cell-surface mucins (Scheme 27). 249 These high molecular weight glycoproteins are involved in specific molecular cell-cell recognition processes. Additionally, the dense clusters of O-linked glycans confer rigidity, provide strong hydration and passivation against biofouling (cell adhesions), thus ensuring protection of structural functions against nonspecific biomolecular interactions. It has been demonstrated that, in native mucins, the clustered N-acetyl-a-D-galactosamine (a-GalNAc) residues proximal to the peptide were the major contributors to the rigidification of peptide backbones.",

Despite preliminary encouraging observations, quantitative evaluations of the foregoing binding assays were complex: a lack of major tendencies and inconsistent results over a same series rendered the interpretation difficult and inaccurate. Finally, a subsequent study furnished a clear demonstration that CNTs could provide suitable support for rapid and efficient polymeric growth for the synthesis of novel and biocompatible linear and hyperbranched glycopolymers by the ''grafting from'' strategy, with good and high reproducibility (Fig. 34 ). 263 The successful and controlled linear glucopyranoside-polymer grafting onto MWNTs was achieved by atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), while hyperbranched glycopolymers were introduced by self-condensing vinyl copolymerization (SCVCP) of the corresponding functionalized 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-3-O-methacryloyl-D-glucofuranose (305) and inimer 2-(2-bromoisobutyryloxy)ethyl methacrylate (306) via ATRP.

After 32 h at room temperature, the authors recorded enrichment in the L-mer isomer, which in the end comprised 85% of the total isomers (vs. 15% in the native mixture). These experimental observations suggested that the dynamic equilibrium seen at room temperature allowed the spatial arrangement of the three GalNAc residues to selfadjust in order to provide a better complementarity to the multivalent carbohydratebinding sites of the lectin. 269 This tendency was confirmed with studies involving other GalNAc-specific lectins, such as Glycine max, specific for a terminal a-D-GalNAc residue attached to the 3 0 -OH group of galactose. Selective enrichment of other diastereoisomers has been observed, indicating the adaptability of the process for lectins presenting different shape and functionnalities in their carbohydratebinding pockets. The intramolecular lectin's binding sites, being too distant from one another to be reached by the close GalNAc residues, strongly suggest a dynamic cross-linking process. Kobayashi et al. employed hexavalent metal complexes based on the self-assembly of three symmetric 2,2 0 -bipyridine ligands tethering two functionalized glycopyranosides around ruthenium(III) 270 or iron(II) 271 as the core component (Fig. 36 ). They undertook complete comparative studies involving glycosylated Tris-bypyridine iron and ruthenium complexes in order to develop robust biosensors for monitoring saccharide-binding phenomena. Synthesis of the ligands was based on the use of a 2,2 0 -bipyridine-4,4 0 -dicarboxylic acid core onto which amino glycopyranoside derivatives were conjugated via amide functions. Hence, self-assembled glycoclusters Fig. 36 . Self-assembled glycodendrimers using chelating metal cations and divalent bipyridine scaffolds. 270, 271 consisted of direct N-linked glycosylamine appendages to the complex, or through a O-linked p-butanamidophenyl spacer, were produced. Three equivalents of the resulting conjugates were then treated with RuCl 3 or FeCl 2 in a minimum amount of boiling water-alcohol mixture to afford the corresponding tris-bipyridineruthenium and iron complexes as mixtures of separable diastereoisomers.",

Their relative binding properties to specific lectins were evaluated by a HAI assay and by SPR, using a-glucosideand a-mannoside-specific ConA and b-galactoside-specific RCA 120 lectins. Lectin affinities observed for the N-linked-glycoclusters 313-316 were low, but high affinities (IC 50 in the micromolar range) were recorded for the elongated conjugates, thus highlighting the importance of the flexibility and the density of the carbohydrate scaffolds. Flexibility seemed essential for reaching high and specific lectin-recognition, and this was probably induced through optimized conformational organization of the epitopes to fit the binding sites of the lectins. On the other hand, strong binding avidities to lectins were not observed, because of the lability of the iron complexes, which readily dissociated in dilute aqueous solution (< 10 \u00c0 6 M).",

The results indicated that dense saccharide clusters played essantial roles in their specific and strong binding, as compared to monovalent precursors. Furthermore, the complexes exhibited intense emission spectra after excitation of the metalto-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band in water, as compared to nonglycosylated ruthenium complex. The strong luminescence was attributed to the peripheral carbohydrate shell caused by closely packed saccharide clusters, which could possibly isolate the luminescent core from that lost to the outer aqueous environment. The structures were considered by the authors to resemble natural proteins having redox and luminescent cores embedded in the polypeptide shells. Interestingly, binding of lectin to these glycoconjugates decreases their luminescence by disrupting their outer carbohydrate shell structure.",

The results revealed that, despite their small molecular weight, the YDS-adducts and more especially 319, exhibited strong inhibitory potency, with an IC 50 of 8.4 mM, being values of two orders of magnitude higher than that of the parent YDS-Asn. The origin of this excellent virus affinity was unknown, but speculations concerning favorable electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the cationic and aromatic-rich complex center and certain amino acid residues of the hemagglutinin have been formulated. In addition, 318 and 319 exhibited strong luminescence at 605 nm, the intensity of which increased with the number of YDS residues. As evoked in the earlier work, this enhancement was attributable to the bulky oligosaccharides spanning around the luminescent core. Interestingly, the addition of influenza type-A viruses to the 318 and 319 in PBS resulted in luminescence quenching, probably caused by disruption of the saccharide shell and the resulting exposure of the luminescent core to the aqueous environment. Although the exact mechanism was not clear, this strategy could allow for the construction of robust and efficient sensitive biosensors for various toxins, viruses, and bacteria. Scheme 32. Enzymatic transglycosylation of a preformed bisglucobipyridine core self-assembled as a hexavalent cluster around a ruthenium cation. 272 This strategy constitutes an extension of the work of Constable et al. 273 who initially described the self-assembly of peripheral saccharides covalently linked to terpyridine moieties. Divalent iron(II) and ruthenium(II) complexes bearing functionalized b-D-glucopyranosides or b-D-galactopyranosides have been efficiently prepared by this approach (Scheme 33). The peracetylated glucosylated terpyridine ligand 322 was obtained under phase-transfer conditions involving the reaction between the nucleophilic 4 0 -hydroxy-2 0 2 0 :6 0 ,2 00 -terpyridine 321 and tetra-O-acetyl-a-D-glucopyranosyl bromide (320) .

All of the neoglycoconjugates, including simple divalent and tetravalent ligands, inhibited the binding of asiaglycophorin to VVA-HRP with greater efficacy than the monomeric standard inhibitor allyl a-D-GalNAc (IC 50 of 158.3 mM). As anticipated, the elongated dimeric analogue 381 was the most potent (IC 50 of 1.82 mM) and the tetravalent ligand 380 showed less potency (IC 50 of 4.09 mM), probably because of the shorter intrasugar distances between each of the branches. As compared to their nonmetal complexes, the metallic clusters clearly exhibited enhanced inhibitory potencies following the expected ''cluster effect.'' Indeed, the Cu(II)-(bipy-GalNAc) tetramers, 380 and 381 were 61-and 251-fold, respectively, more potent than the monovalent control, while octamer 382 exhibited a 259-fold enhanced avidity.

These results clearly demonstrate that the structural arrangement and flexibility of the molecules play crucial roles in their relative binding affinities.

This supramolecular assembly process has also been directed toward the synthesis of metallic and fluorescent glycodendritic architectures. 278 Thus, homogenous fluorescent and sugar-functionalized metallic dendrimers, containing various numbers and types of monosaccharides have been prepared.

Scheme 41. Mannosylated glycodendrimers on a bipyridine core for ruthenium complexation. 279 The rate of electron transfer within the complexes was investigated by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between photoexcited Ru(II)-templates and a suitable quencher (N, N 0 -4,4 0 -bis(benzyl-3-boronic acid)bipyridinium dibromide, BBV) having high affinity for sugar. As expected, all compounds exhibited different extents of quenching, depending on the degree of peripheral carbohydrate density that efficiently insulated the core properties. The rate of energy transfer induced by photoexcitation of the complexes was also evaluated by quantification of molecular oxygen in the singlet state trapped by a quencher (TEMPO). The rate of appearance of the generated stable species (TEMPO) decreased from 398 to 400, thus supporting the notion that dense carbohydrate insulation of the Ru(II) template presents a shield that stopped effective energy transfer to dissolved oxygen. In addition, the selectivity and sensitivity of these processes have been studied by use of complexes as lectin biosensors. ConA and Galanthus nivilis agglutinin (GNA), both tetramers that contain one and three mannose-binding sites per subunit, respectively, were selected for these investigations. The concept was based on the reconstitution of the fluorescent signal when preliminary complexes between the BBV quencher and mannosylated-complexes were disrupted in favor of the tight interactions that take place between glycodendrimers and lectins. A spontaneous gain in fluoresecence was observed with the addition of 75 nM of ConA to the initial mixture of hexavalent complex and BBV. In contrast, more modest gains in fluorescence were obtained for dendrimers containing 18 mannosides under the same conditions, but a steady and linear increment continued at higher concentrations of ConA. Similar experiments with the higher valency lectin GNA induced the same tendency. Based on these results, detection limits for each Ru-complex were evaluated and compared, indicating that hexavalent glycoconjugate 398 was the most sensitive; whereas a higher detection limit was determined for 399 and 400 which exhibited a broader limited range of linear response. In conclusion, although complex 398 represented the best compromise between encapsulation and efficient quenching properties for sensitive lectin sensing, glycodendrimers 399 and 400 were also suitable sensitive biomarkers to study lectin-carbohydrate interactions, owing to their high quantum yield and excellent lectin-affinity through their high carbohydrate density.",

Measurements indicated the formation of small aggregates of 50 kDa for the first generation (406) whereas the tetravalent analogue 409 formed large particles of 7000 kDa, corresponding to the aggregation of more than 1500 individual molecules per particle. Surprisingly, the particle weight obtained with higher generation dendrimers decreased with increasing mass of the individual molecule. Furthermore, the third-generation glycodendrimers 410, containing eight (RS-or R 1 S-) residues, exhibited similar size and weight, indicating that particle structure depended primarily on the dendritic core architecture, and less on the size and the nature of the carbohydrate group. The synthesis of several dendritic cores containing more branched aliphatic components in their structures, such as cyclohexyl rings, linear alkyl chains, or methylated amides demonstrated that only highly aromatic architectures induced aggregation as a result of p-stacking, hydrophobic interactions, and rigidity. 281 The authors assumed that intramolecular p-stacking led to preorganization, allowing efficient core-core contacts. An optimal core-core interaction was recorded for the second generation, whereas the lowest generation dendrimer was too small and the largest ones were too shielded by the dense carbohydrates. In addition, both the shape and the size of these homogenous nanoparticles (within a factor of 2) was investigated by AFM, indicating a disk-like morphology, having average diameters decreasing with increasing mass of the individual molecule, thus resembling their tendency in solution.",

To assess the compounds as polyvalent IgM ligands, the authors employed two in vitro assays in which the inhibition of both the anti-aGal IgM binding to the xenoantigen and the aGal-mediated lysis of pig erythrocytes were measured. In agreement with previous results, monomeric aGal was inactive at 100 mM in both assays. Whereas no activity was observed for the divalent conjugate, the second-and third-generation dendrimers 409 and 410 were highly potent in both assays (0.025, 0.035 mM and 0.010, 0.010 mM, respectively). The fourth-generation analogue, containing 16 peripheral aGal residues, also showed high potency in the binding assay (0.019 mM) but was significantly less potent in the hemolysis assay (0.18 mM). Generally, potency decreased drastically for the larger dendrimers which did not induce aggregation. The avidity thus correlated with the size of the aggregates, but not with the size of the individual particles. Preliminary in vitro results highlighted the involvment of polyvalent aggregates in antibody binding, without nonspecific interactions of the dendrimer backbone. The most potent compound (410) bearing eight trisaccharidic epitopes, was selected for in vivo profiling in cynomolgus monkeys.",

Definition and History.-A dendrimer is a synthetic highly branched monodisperse and polyfunctional macromolecule, constituted by repetitive units (so-called ''generations'') that are chemically bound to each other by an arborescent process around a multifunctional central core. 282, 283 Thus, as opposed to traditional polymers, which often have poorly defined molecular structures that are clearly an important drawback for medical application in terms of product characteristics, dendrimers are structurally well defined and can be synthesized from a fully controlled iterative approach. Although differences exist in terms of rigidity and compaction, dendrimers are often compared to ''artificial proteins'' with their semiglobular or globular structures, mostly with a high density of peripheral functionalities and a small molecular ''volume.'' 284, 285 It is now accepted that dendritic polymers are the fourth major class of polymeric architecture, consisting of three subsets that are based on the degree of structural control, namely: (a) random hyperbranched polymers, (b) dendrigraft polymers, and (c) dendrimers. The concept of repetitive and controlled synthetic growth with branching was first reported by V\u00f6gtle, who achieved the construction of a low molecular weight ''cascade'' polyamine. 286 However, it was not until 1985 that the groups of Newkome 287 and Tomalia 288 independently described a divergent macromolecular synthesis, giving birth to the first well-characterized true dendrimers, named ''arborols'' and ''PAMAM'' [poly(amidoamine)] dendrimers, respectively. Their strategy thus efficiently avoided problems of low yields, purity, or purification encountered by V\u00f6gtle in his cascade synthesis. In their chapter, Tomalia et al. paved the way to dendritic structures: their definition and construction, and introducing for the first time the term ''dendrimer,'' which arises from the Greek dendron meaning ''tree'' or ''branch,'' and meros meaning ''part.'' Their original and efficient methodology still constitutes the preferred commercial route to the trademarked Starburst dendrimer family, with molecular weights ranging from several hundred to over 1 million Daltons (namely, generations 1-13). Until the mid-1990s, the synthetic challenge of such aesthetic structures stimulated numerous research groups to investigate intensively a range of synthetic strategies. These efforts gave rise to original dendritic structures emerging from two main synthetic strategies used to construct perfectly branched dendrimers: the divergent and the convergent approach. Over time, an accelerated version of the convergent strategy has been developed in order to increase its throughput and efficiency by using clever adaptations of cores or dendrons.",

Application of polymeric systems has been exploited advantageously to enhance hydrosolubility, biocompatibility, lack of toxicity, immunogenicity in order to improve drug stability, and selectivity toward malignant tissues. This enhancement of therapeutic properties observed with the use of ''prodrugs'' has been explained by the physical properties of these polymeric structures, presenting high hydrodynamic volumes that facilitate blood persistence and accumulation in tumoral tissues in particular.This phenomenon, called the ''EPR effect'' (i.e., enhanced permeation retention), may be roughly explained by physiological and biochemical differences observed between tumoral and healthy tissues.

The use of dendrimers in biological systems, and also systematic studies of the most common dendritic scaffolds to determinate their biocompatibility, such as in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity, their biostability or immunogenicity have been extensively reviewed. 290, 291 One typical example concerns the use of dendrimers as ''glycocarriers'' for the control of multimeric presentation of biologically relevant carbohydrate moieties that are useful for targeting modified tissue in malignant diseases for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In such molecules, termed ''glycodendrimers,'' the saccharide portions are conjugated according to the principles of dendritic growth or are ligated to preexisting highly functionalized and repetitive dendritic scaffolds having varied molecular weights and structures. Since they first appeared in the literature in 1993, 292 glycodendrimers and related glycodendrons, with their spheroidal or dendritic wedge structures, have been initially designed as bioisosteres of cell-surface multiantennary glycans that stimulated wide interests within the scientific community.

All of these original synthetic clusters were constructed in such a way that their valencies, shapes, and carbohydrate contents could be varied at will with a controlled integration of dendritic building blocks.

            "text": "b. Glycodendrimer Syntheses.-Historically, the divergent strategy was used to prepare the first dendritic structures. Dendrimers are built iteratively out from a central core, layer by layer, requiring activation/addition steps to afford the desired dendritic structures: the focal and multifunctional molecules are systematically expanded outward using various chemical linkages. The first-generation dendrimer is simply formed by attaching branching units to the core molecules. To form the second-generation dendrimer, the peripheral functional groups then react with a complementary chemical function presented on the branched building blocks. To avoid hyperbranched polymerization, this step has to be carefully controlled by using protected (or inert) groups on the building blocks. Activation (deprotection or chemical transformation) of the newly attached surface groups leads to the second-generation dendrimer. The generation growth quickly allows exponential multiplication of active terminal functions, and the process is repeated until the required degree of branching is obtained. For glycodendrimers, the sugars are then appended at the periphery of the molecules. Although this approach is conceptually straightforward, synthetic problems are sometimes encountered, involving the use of very large excess of reagent (or monomer) in each synthetic step to ensure complete functionalization and the necessity of efficient coupling in regard to the exponentially increasing number of functions. To accentuate the difficulty, and although monomers are generally easy to remove, separation of the required dendrimer from the structurally flawed by-products usually remains challenging, because of their mass, size, and general properties that are very close to the perfect dendrimer. For the sake of simplicity and diminished cost, the inner scaffold portion of the glycodendrimer can be either synthesized by a one-pot procedure using hyperbranched polymer methodologies, or purchased directly. Indeed, several dendrimers having various surface functionalities and building blocks are commercially available: polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM, Starburst , Dendritic Nanotechnologies), polypropyleneimine (PPI, Astramol , DSM Fine Chemicals), polyglycerol dendrimers, and hyperbranched dendritic polymers (Boltorn ), are most commonly used as multibranched dendritic core or glycodendron precursors, and most of them are known to be nontoxic and nonimmunogenic.",

It involves the preliminary synthesis of peripheral branched dendritic arms, named ''dendrons'' or ''glycodendrons,'' from the ''outside-in.'' This concept can be described by envisaging the attachment of X terminal units containing one reactive group to one polyfunctional monomer possessing orthogonally protected functionalities, resulting in the first-generation dendron. Transformation of the unique focal site, followed by treatment with 1 / X equivalent of the protected monomer or a polyfunctional central core affords the next higher generation dendron or a dendrimer. The advantages of the convergent strategy lie with the diminished number of reactions carried out in each step. Moreover, purification of the desired dendrimer becomes less problematic than in the divergent case, fewer by-products are generated and they are structurally very different from the perfect target dendrimer. However, the fact that the focal functionalities of the wedge may be sterically inaccessible from within the infrastructure (depending on the generation) causes difficulties toward subsequent linkage to the core, thus resulting in slower and less efficient reactions as the generation grows. Nevertheless, it is now well established that a large number of surface glycan moieties impede accessibility of the carbohydrate by carbohydrate-binding receptors. Considering these synthetic advantages, this methodology has been used successfully for access to dissymmetric dendritic structures. 300 Cumbersome purifications and synthetic disadvantages observed with both iterative approaches have motivated investigations toward accelerated synthetic methodologies. To improve synthesis efficacy and limit synthetic steps, while preserving monodispersity and functionalization versatility, new strategies have been successfully addressed. These include the development of larger building blocks involved in ''multigeneration'' coupling, as largely described by Fr\u00e9chet et al. In this way, high molecular weight dendrimers and dendrons have been synthesized using highly polyfunctional dendritic cores (''hypercores''), 301 and high-generation dendrons for subsequent coupling reaction (''hypermonomers''), 302 which can also be obtained by an orthogonal protected functions approach (''double exponential growth strategies''). 303 An elegant application has been described 304 based on this design to allow for more rapid dendritic construction, starting with small glycoclusters, which are attached to branching units to form glycosylated hypermonomers and then finally to a suitable central part. More recently, another clever strategy based on ''orthogonal monomer systems'' has been designed. 305, 306 The judicious use of functionalized building blocks that are coupled together without need of protection/deprotection steps has allowed rapid and easy access to homogeneous and heterogeneous dendrimers.",

One of their first applications was to prevent tissue infection by the pentameric bacterial toxin from V. cholerae. The approach for preventing binding of CT-GM 1 consisted in considering the terminal galactose residue (Fig. 9 ) as the anchoring fragment, to which various pharmacophores could be attached to provide optimized small-molecule antagonists against CT. This strategy was based on the fact that this galactose residue bound very specifically at a buried pocket of the receptor-binding site. However, the rest of the binding site is very shallow and lacks well-defined hydrophobic pockets that can be exploited using traditional structure-based drug design to arrive at potent inhibitors. Initial studies were made by screening commercially available galactose derivatives. Using ELISA, it resulted that m-nitrophenyl a-Dgalactopyranoside (MNPG) was the best inhibitor identified, with an IC 50 of 720 mM, corresponding to a 100-fold better affinity for CT than that of the ''lead'' galactoside. 307 In addition, a small library of antagonists showing up to 14-fold improvement as compared to the best MNPG candidate was designed. The library consisted of 3,5-disubstituted phenyl galactosides (as a/b anomeric mixtures), in which a hydrophobic ring-system was linked via a short, flexible aliphatic linker through an amide linkage at the remaining meta position of the MNPG core. 308 Further improvements were obtained by using a simplified strategy based on the use of relatively simple lactose derivatives (Fig. 40) . 309 Fig. 40 . Simple lactoside analogues as surrogates for the more complex GM 1 oligosaccharide ligand against the pentameric bacterial toxin from Vibrio cholerae. 309 inhibitor (411) for CT was developed and had a K D of 248 mM from a direct fluorescence-binding assay. This rather low value was attributed to the presence of the thiourea moiety, and the aryl group that seemed to contribute to the 70-fold binding enhancement as compared to unsubstituted lactose (K D \u00bc 18 mM). An improvement in binding affinity was further observed by the same group with a new lactose 2-aminothiazoline conjugate (412) , formed by a cyclization of the thiourea sulfur atom onto a triple bond and containing a more rigid spacer between the sugar and the aryl group. 310 Fluorescence studies revealed one order of magnitude enhancement in its affinity (K D \u00bc 23 mM) for the CTB subunit, as compared with that of thiourea derivative.",

This context allowed the synthesis of generation 1, 2, and 3 of lactosylated dendrons based on a 3,5-bis(2-aminoethoxy)benzoic acid repeating unit and containing 2 (413), 4 (415) , and 8 peripheral lactoside residues (417) , respectively, bound to the dendritic scaffold via thiourea linkages (Fig. 41) . 309 Binding affinities with the CT subunit were determined by fluorescence assay (FRET) and ranged from 18 mM for lactose to 33 mM for the octavalent glycodendron 417. This value corresponded to an eightfold enhancement as compared to corresponding monovalent lactoside derivative under the same conditions. However, an increase in the branching of the dendron (namely valency) provided only a modest increase in the potency of the ligand, corresponding to a rather constant relative potency per lactose, regardless of the number of peripheral epitopes.",

Octameric glycodendrons bearing GM 1 analogues. [312] [313] [314] Analytical ultracentrifugation and DLS have been used to demonstrate that the multivalent inhibitors induced protein aggregation and the formation of space-filling networks. This aggregation process appeared to take place when using ligands that did not match the valency of the protein receptor. Interestingly, the valency of the inhibitor had a dramatic effect on the mechanism of aggregation, influencing both the kinetics of aggregation and the stability of intermediate protein complexes. In addition, structural studies employing AFM have revealed that a divalent inhibitor induced head-to-head dimerization of the protein toxin, which either prevented the LTBh pentamer from sitting flat on the surface, or gave rise to a protein bilayer. Considering that tetravalent structures were shown to be more potent inhibitors than pentavalent analogues of similar size, the development of a strategy based on the use of mismatched valencies may provide more relevant multivalent therapeutics against pentameric bacterial toxins, thus adding to the arsenal of multivalent strategies.",

Interestingly, O117 LPS resembles Gb3, but there are significant structural differences since Gb3 has a terminal a-(1!4)-digalactoside moiety, whereas the neutralizing polysaccharide has a modified terminal digalactose moiety possessing a bulky N-acetyl group at each 2-position. In contrast to Gb3, which binds to both Stx1 and Stx2, O117 LPS was not able to bind Stx1 or to neutralize its effect on Vero cells, suggesting that the Nacetyl group sufficiently modifies the binding specificity toward Stx1. Tailored biantennary glycoconjugates (435) (436) (437) consisting of three structural components including peripheral carbohydrate-recognition components, flexible aliphatic spacers, and a biotinylated dimer have been synthesized with varied N-acetylation patterns.

More precisely, 437 appeared to be a better substrate for Stx2 than 435. In contrast and surprisingly, 436, constructed with the Gb3 analogue, bound exclusively to Stx1, probably due to the biantennary architecture with a short spacer that constrained binding to Stx2. Finally, the authors proved the ability of 436 to capture Stx1 in clinical applications, without any interference from a complex sample, indicating the feasibility of highly selective and sensitive synthetic glycoconjugate-based detection reagents for Stx by introducing simple manipulations in the structure of known saccharide receptors. Using the same versatile modular synthetic strategy, the same group developed biotinylated bi- (438) and tetra-antennary (439) mannosylated glycoconjugates to capture and detect E. coli cells, and compared the relative capturing ability of these molecules to commercial polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 47) . 318 Instead of aliphatic spacers, tetraethylene glycol linkers were used to diminish nonspecific binding and to impart flexibility for a better fit in the active sites.",

In this context, ''glycomagnetic'' beads completely covered with glycans were incubated with two isogenic strains of E. coli, ORN178 and ORN208. The ORN178 E. coli bears numerous fimbrial adhesins (FimH) possessing binding preferences to a-mannosides. The second strain is a mutant lacking pilus expression. In initial experiments, strain ORN178 mediated the aggregation of beads coated with mannose-bearing divalent compound 438 within minutes of addition to the beads, whereas strain ORN208 did not. Bacterial aggregation has been shown to be dependent on multivalency, and these results suggested that a single bacterium could bind to multiple beads. Moreover, at higher concentrations of E. coli, the tetravalent conjugate 439 was responsible for an increase in capture effectiveness. The authors further compared their competence relative to standard antibody-coated beads for the capture of bacteria. The results indicated that the glycoconjugate-coated magnetic beads outperformed traditional antibody-coated magnetic beads in sensivity and selectivity when compared under identical experimental conditions. In addition, these systems could capture E. coli from environmental samples of stagnant water, with the possibility for targeting specific pathogenic bacteria modulating the nature of the carbohydrate recognition component. These experiments thus clearly revealed the power of glycans in biosensing, and demonstrated that these stable and inexpensive glycomagnetic beads could be used for capture and isolation of pathogens from other complex matrices.",

The key AB 2 -type glucoside building block 440 was used for the preparation of multigeneration glycopeptide dendrons from its orthogonal deprotection, to yield complementary building blocks 441 and 442. Hence, mildly alkaline hydrolysis of the methyl ester groups led to dicarboxylic acid 441, whereas removal of the N-Boc protecting group with a TFA-dimethyl sulfide mixture afforded amino-functionalized glucoside 442. HATU-mediated peptide coupling, together with DIPEA gave protected first-generation glycodendron 443 in 79% yield. Using the N-Boc-deprotection and peptide-coupling reaction sequence, the synthesis of higher generations of glycopeptide dendrons was carried out convergently. Hence, 443 was converted into its amine derivative 444, whose coupling with 441 led to protected G(2) glycopeptide dendron 445 in 60% yield. The same convergent strategy was applied for the construction of the third-generation glycodendron 447 containing eight peripheral glucoside units, via peptide coupling between 446 dendron and 441. Although no biological investigation was proposed by the authors, the stability of O-deacetylated G(1) glycodendron against b-glycosidases from almonds was evaluated and no degradation was observed over several hours.",

Subsequent etherification with bismannosemodified alcohol 468 furnished 469 which after acidic deprotection provided an example of a mixed-type polyether glycodendron. The second way was based on the preliminary desymmetrization of 461 with one of the saccharides, followed by attachment of the other one on the remaining reactive function.

            "text": "Interesting results from biological studies indicated that G(2)-Man 9 479 appeared to be an effective mimic of the HIV-1 gp120 surface glycan, suitable for conjugation to a carrier protein as a vaccine candidate. Furthermore, evaluation of inhibition of DC-SIGN with 479 was studied via gp120/Fc-DC-SIGN ELISA tests. Excellent inhibition activity in the nanomolar range was demonstrated, in contrast to the millimolar range from the reference mannoside. In these experiments, no inhibition was observed for the corresponding nonglycosylated alkynyl dendron 477 (up to 0.1 mM), indicating that the multivalent oligomannose residues were responsible for DC-SIGN binding. The inhibition of glycodendrons interacting with antibody 2G12 and DC-SIGN indicated that these dendritic architectures, especially for G(2)-Man 9 glycodendron 479, had the potential for use in the development of both carbohydrate vaccine candidates and as antiviral agents. Oligomannoside-ending azides used in ''click-chemistry'' toward HIV-1 gp120 mimetics recognized by human antibody 2G12 and DC-SIGN. 325 As with TRIS, the commercially available gallic acid 480 constitutes an ideal candidate as branching unit for rapid dendritic growth. It allows dendron and dendrimer scaffolding to reach 3 n surface groups at the nth generation. Thus, gallic acid and its derivatives can afford highly functionalized glycosylated structures, taking advantage of its geometry for orthogonal transformation. It was initially used by Roy et al. for the construction of hyperbranched dendritic lactosides presenting up to nine peripheral saccharide residues (Scheme 49). 326 The convergent strategy described relied on the synthesis of a thiolated lactoside derivative 482, to be added to a preformed gallic acid derivative containing G(0) or G(1) dendrons (481) capped with functionalized tetra(ethylene)glycol, to afford such glycodendrons as 483. The hydrophilic spacer was chosen to ensure advantageous water solubility of the resulting dendrimer and to counteract the hydrophobic effect of the aromatic gallic acid.",

            "text": "a. Glycopeptide Dendrimers.-As stated earlier, the first glycopeptide dendrimers were described in the literature in 1993. 292 They were built using divergent solid-phase peptide Fmoc-chemistry and L-lysine as a repeating amino acid on a Wang resin. The initial sugar attached was sialic acid, which was introduced to confer strong inhibitory properties against flu virus hemagglutinin, a lectin-like protein recognizing a-sialosides on respiratory mucins. This early hyperbranched L-lysine scaffold was elongated with N-chloroacetylglycylglycine and efficiently coupled to a peracetylated a-thiosialoside. Using dendrons bearing eight surface a-thiosialosides, Roy et al. 332 demonstrated that each saccharide moiety was a 1000-fold better, on a per saccharide basis, than the corresponding monomer, while being stable to viral neuraminidase. These interesting architectures were, however, not as potent as sialopolymers since they could not properly cover the entire surfaces of the spherical virions, a property well exploited by random-coiled polymers. 333, 334 It was later argued that dendronized polymers had improved potencies in this respect (see following PAMAM section). 335 When the same poly-L-lysine scaffold was utilized with mannoside residues bearing an optimized arylated aglycon, the resulting 8-and 16mer glycodendrons showed 100,000-fold increased inhibitory potency against fimbriated E. coli K12 on a per mannoside basis. 336 The structure of the 8-mer mannosylated dendrimer (501) is illustrated in Fig. 53 . The octameric aminophenyl a-D-mannopyranoside had an IC 50 of 2.8 nM (22.4 nM/Man). It was found that a competitive binding assay measuring the binding of 125 I-labeled, highly mannosylated neoglycoprotein (BSA) to type-1 fimbriated E. coli (K12) strain in suspension gave much lower IC 50 values than the equivalent values obtained by hemagglutination or in assays that involved microplate immobilization. Two key features strongly influencing the affinity to E. coli adhesin were: (1) the presence of an a-oriented aglycone bearing a hydrophobic group, and (2) the presence of multiple mannoside residues that can span a distance of 20 nm or longer. The two best inhibitors were a highly mannosylated neoglycoprotein with the longest linking arm between a mannose and protein amino group, and the 16-mer mannosylated dendrimer (fourth generation), with an IC 50 of 0.9 nM (14.4 nM/Man). First described and patented by Denkewalter et al. in the late 1970s, 337 dendronized lysine is one of the most widely used core structures in dendrimer 338 and glycodendrimer synthesis. An excellent series of reviews by the group of Je\u017eek on the synthesis and biological applications of lysine-based glycodendrimers has been published. [339] [340] [341] [342] Such glycosylated lysine dendrimers have been prepared both on solid supports [343] [344] [345] and in solution. [346] [347] [348] Reaction of the peripheral amino groups with a variety of electrophiles carrying pendant sugar residues (such as isothiocyanates, carboxylic acid, and reducing sugars) have lead to glycodendrimer thioureas, amides, and amines, respectively. Sugars bearing activated ester groups have also been coupled to dendritic lysines to provide galactoside-and N-acetylglucosamine-capped glycoclusters, 316, 349 including the important Thomsen Friedenreich (TF) disaccharide antigen [b-D-Gal(1!3)-a-D-GalNAc] known as a breast cancer marker and against which monoclonal antibodies were raised (see, for instance, Fig. 45 ). 350, 351 The corresponding TF-bearing glycodendrimers bound to the antibodies, and were shown to be adsorbed strongly onto the surface of microtiter plates. The analogous b-D-GlcNAc glycodendrimer was also further elaborated as the Lewis X tetrasaccharide antigens 502, using multiple chemoenzymatic processes (Fig. 54) . 352 Analogous mannosylated architectures have also been proposed. MBP acting as receptors can mediate uptake and internalization of both soluble and particulate glycoconjugates, and as such they take part in innate immunity. 353, 354 The broad pattern-recognition displayed by mannose receptors, together with their implication in adaptive immunity, has stimulated considerable efforts toward the selective delivery of enzymes, 355, 356 drugs, [357] [358] [359] oligonucleotides or genes, [360] [361] [362] [363] and antigens [364] [365] [366] to cells expressing them, for therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Another important mannose receptor is a membrane-associated protein restricted on sinusoidal liver cells, peripheral and bone marrow macrophages, and dendritic cells. It also recognizes and internalizes mannosylated glycoconjugates from pathological microorganisms, tumor and yeast cells, such glycoproteins as type-I procollagen, tissue-type plasminogen activator, or various lysosomal enzymes. As such, this mannose receptor contributes to the nonimmune host-defense system. In addition, the macrophage receptor is implicated in major histocompatability complex-mediated antigen (MHC) presentation by dendritic cells (DC-SIGN) (Dendritic Cell-Specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin) (ICAM-3 \u00bc intercellular adhesion molecule). DC-SIGN also belongs to the family of C-type lectins able to bind high-mannose glycoproteins of HIV-gp120, Ebola-gp 1, or Dengue-gp E. DC-SIGN is also known to oligomerize, and it is therefore particularly important to understand the intrinsic binding and multivalent binding requirements of this lectin. In this context, Biessen et al. conceived oligomeric linear L-lysine mannosides bearing the same arylated aglycone just described for 501. 367 Its associated p-isothiocyanatophenyl a-D-mannopyranoside was coupled to the poly-L-lysine backbone through an isothiourea linkage. The structure of the 6-mer 503 is illustrated in Fig. 55 . The affinity of these mannoclusters toward the mannose receptor increased steadily from 18-23 mM (dimer) to 0.5-2.6 nM (6-mer). As a consequence of its high affinity, 503 is a promising targeting device for cell-specific genes and delivery of drugs to liver endothelial cells or macrophages in bone marrow, lungs, spleen, and atherosclerotic plaques.",

Fluorescein-labeled pseudoglycodendrimers with valencies of two to eight were tested by competitive-inhibition assays with mannan, which was evaluated by confocal microscopy using mannose receptors expressed in transfected COS-1-cells. Cells expressing mannose receptor-mediated uptake were assayed on monocyte-derived human dendritic cells by cytofluorometric analysis. The synthetic clusters were shown to be effective ligands against the dendritic cells, with an optimum affinity 367, 368 toward clusters having a valency of four (504). However, the glycomimetics as well as the natural mannosides did not perform , although the results indicated that the mannose receptor could accommodate structures that diverged significantly from previously identified natural ligands and which could be further optimized using QSAR. 369, 370 Additionally, monodisperse lysine dendrimers capped with 2-64 mono-, di-, and tri-a-D-mannopyranosyl residues did not induce dendritic cell maturation. 348 As stated, DC-SIGN is a key mannoside receptor for exogenous pathogens that is used by viruses for entry into the lymph nodes. The inhibition of this process has thus been sought as an interesting strategy for blocking viral adhesion. Consequently, a series of mannosylated Boltorn dendrimers was prepared (see later section) that were rather efficient in this respect.",

They were incorporated onto mannosylated dendrons prepared entirely by SPPS (Fmoc-chemistry) and used for the imaging studies of mannose receptor-mediated entry into dendritic cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy. 371 After pathogen capture, internalization, and digestion, peptide fragments were expressed on MHC molecules. A T cell-specific immune response was thereby initiated. This sequence of biological events was exploited for vaccine design (see next). The heterobifunctional, high-affinity multivalent ligand was assembled on nontoxic, nonimmunogenic poly-L-lysine dendrimers to which the required number of mannosyl residues can be attached simultaneously via a 4-hydroxybutanoic acid linker, a substance occurring naturally in mammals. The synthesis of the model poly-L-lysine dendrons was initially performed on a commercial Tentagel resin preloaded with Fmoc-Sieber amide linker. The low loading level of the commercial resin (0.16 mmol/g) ensured that sufficient space was allowed for the large fourth and fifth-generation dendrons to be assembled without problems of steric hindrance. At the same time, the mild cleavage conditions required for this type of resin did not cause significant acidpromoted glycoside hydrolysis. The 4-(mannopyranosyloxy)butanoic acid was then introduced by classical peptide-coupling reagents.",

The side chain of the focal e-amine, protected by the Mtt group, was used for labeling, in conjunction with the considerably less acid-labile commercial Rink amide linker for maximum versatility. Thus, the Rink amide Tentagel resin was loaded with Fmoc-Lys(Mtt)-OH and the N-terminal Fmoc group was removed by classical treatment with 20% piperidine in DMF. After the reiterative insertion of bis-Fmoc lysine was terminated, the Mtt group was removed at low TFA concentrations with minimal losses of the dendron, and the newly freed amine was directly labeled onto the resin. Accordingly, treatment of the polymersupported G(4) dendron with 3% TFA in CH 2 Cl 2 led to complete removal of the Mtt group within a short time. Lower concentrations of TFA were inefficient. The free amine group of the glycodendrons was then treated with the appropriate fluorescent probes to provide desired mannosylated glycodendrons such as 505 (Fig. 56) .",

Glycopeptide libraries have also been synthesized with divalent carbohydrate structures to optimize multivalent carbohydrate-binding protein interactions at subsite at the vicinity of the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). 81 As stated earlier, dendritic cells and macrophages are valuable antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These cells express MBPs and, as such, they constitute important entry mechanisms for vaccine targeting. Thus, instead of linking short peptide antigens to 374, 375 classical immunogenic protein carriers, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or tetanus toxoid and the like, a study was evaluated toward the possibility of using mannoside-capped polylysine glycodendrimers (511) constructed at the N-terminal of several immunogenic peptides (Fig. 59) . 376 Peptide sequences from HIV-1 gp41 protein (541-555 bearing the LLSGIV motif capable of inhibiting viral fusion, 553-567), 377 SARS-CoV S2 (1081-1105, 1144-1187) , and influenza hemagglutinin HA2 were built on a Rink amide resin. The lysine moieties were then introduced as a G(3) lysine dendron followed by mannosylation, using 4-(mannopyranosyloxy)butanoic acid (512) at the terminal (E) amino groups of the lysyl-peptide dendrimer (513). Preliminary data from the resulting vaccine candidate 511, containing the LLSGIV motif, demonstrated that it could elicit a polyclonal antibody response in rabbit much stronger than the KLH constructs. It was concluded that the mannosylated dendron was stabilizing the peptide from proteolysis. N-Terminally mannosylated peptides carrying one to six mannose residues were also shown by Koning and coworkers to elicit an immune response, with efficiency up to 104-fold greater than peptide antigens alone. 378 The capture of antigenic determinants by APCs that will ultimately appear in MHCs for T helper cell stimulation depends on several factors. If APCs are represented by B cells, multivalency becomes an issue, because both the recognition and the binding events are triggered by cell-surface immunoglobulins. A classical example of successful applications in this regard is presented by the high immunogenicity of bacterial capsular polysaccharides (CPS) which, on their own, can elicit protective antibodies. 379, 380 However, the resulting antibodies are usually limited to low-affinity IgMs, and the immune responses lack memory effects because of the absence of T Fig. 59 . Entirely synthetic anti-HIV vaccine candidate capable of APCs uptake. 376, 377 cell-dependent antigens normally associated to peptides. CPS are thus said to be T independent antigens. Alternatively, if the B cell antigens are not multivalent, such as those found in small peptides or oligosaccharides, they will greatly benefit from being mounted on dendritic scaffolds. Moreover, the key T cell epitopes, needed in the context of MHC complexes, can be typically short 15-mer peptides and yet, be too small for efficient uptake by APCs. Consequently, the design of dendritic glycoconjugates bearing multiples copies of both oligosaccharides (B cell epitopes) and short peptides (T cell epitopes) has been proposed as entirely synthetic vaccine candidates (514) (Fig. 60) .",

            "text": "A few elegant applications of this principle have been recently proposed for triggering neutralizing antibodies against the V-3 loop glycoprotein of gp120 from HIV-1 isolates that recognize and bind to the high mannose oligosaccharide epitope Man 9 GlcNAc 2 183 (Fig. 24 ) that is present in numerous copies on gp120. The proposal was based on the observation that a swapped human antibody, named 2G12, was identified in a patient that successfully mounted a protective anti-HIV immune response (Fig. 61) . 381 Besides glycoclusters based on a central peptide, earlier presented in Section II.4, the group of Kunz was the first to fully demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of eliciting complete immune responses with memory effects, using carbohydrate cancer antigens built on multiple antigen glycopeptide scaffolds. 382, 383 Thus, the immunogenicity of synthetic multiple antigenic glycopeptides (MAGs) displaying four clustered T N -epitopes anchored to an oligomeric branched lysine core was examined (Fig. 62) . Conventional SPS of the peptidic structure was performed by Fmoc-methodology on Wang resin. The dendritic immunogen 516, containing clusters of three consecutive T N -epitopes linked to the poliovirus T cell epitope KLFAVWKITYKDT, was tested in mice as both a prophylactic and as a therapeutic cancer vaccine. As the analogous MAG 515, harboring only four monomeric T N -antigens that have been shown to increase the survival of tumor-bearing mice, added results indicated that 516 showed high immunogenicity and good protection against the development of T N -expressing tumor cells. Poliovirus T cell epitopes capped with monomeric (515) and trimeric T N -antigens (516) that confered high murine immunogenicity. 382, 383 The N-linked pentasaccharide core Man 3 (GlcNAc) 2 glycopeptide bearing the extracellular MMP inducer sequence 517 (emmprin 34-58) has been successfully linked to G(1) PAMAM aminodendrimer by thioester activation (Fig. 63) . The resulting octameric 30 kDa construct was obtained in low yield, but was purified by preparative electrophoresis and fully characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The multivalent architecture was built to evaluate the requirement of emmprin multimerization for inducing MMP expression. 384 The numerous successes achieved in the solid-phase syntheses (SPS) of glycopeptides dendrimers, coupled to their ease of preparation and purification, has also triggered chemists to apply the SPS nucleotide chemistry toward the synthesis of phosphodiester-linked glycodendrimers. As mentioned earlier in the glycoclusters section, the chemistry and geometry of phosphodiesters and triesters are obviously appealing factors for their use as glycodendrimer scaffolds. The following strategy was based on the synthesis of key phosphoramidite building blocks bearing either N-chloroacetyl or alcohol end groups for further branching. 385 DEG spacers were initially transformed into the mono tert-butyldiphenylsilyl derivative 518 which upon treatment with N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidous dichloride (Cl 2 P-N-(iPr) 2 , DIPEA, CH 2 Cl 2 ), provided the essential building block N,N-diisopropyldiphosphoramidite (519) in 84% yield (Fig. 64) . Alternatively, the mono n-chloroacetylated DEG derivative 520, prepared from commercially available 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol (ClCH 2 CO 2 H, EEDQ, 45 C, 4 h, 82%) was similarly treated to provide phosphoramidite 521 (68%). Further couplings of 519 or 521 with alcohols 518 or 520 in the presence of 1H-tetrazole gave the corresponding phosphotriesters 522 or 523 after oxidation with t-butyl peroxide (70-71%). Coupling tris(N-chloroacetyl) derivative 524 (MeOH, Et 3 N) with the thiolated N-acetylgalactosaminide 525 afforded a firstgeneration phosphoglycodendrimer (63%) having three a-D-GalNAc moieties (not shown). Thiol 525 was prepared from allyl N-acetyl-a-D-galactosaminide by reaction with thioacetic acid (HSAc, MeOH, AIBN, reflux, 10 h, 77%) followed by Zempl\u00e9n S-deacetylation.",

Nucleophilic displacement of the hexavalent N-chloroacetylated precursor by 525 as before, provided hexavalent dendrimer 526 (52%). Further processing of the synthetic sequence, coupled with tethering strategies with various spacers, gave access to a family of dendrimers having many different valencies. All of the GalNAc-bearing phosphodendrimers thus produced were tested as inhibitors of the plant lectin V. villosa binding to asialoglycophorin, a natural ligand for hepatocytes receptors. The results indicated a 3-10-fold (hexamer) enhanced affinity over the monovalent ligand, thus supporting once again the glycoside cluster effect.

Several dendrimer scaffolds having various surface functionalities and valencies, constructed from diverse building blocks and according to both general synthetic strategies (Fig. 66 , see also Section V. ones are illustrated in Fig. 66 . Among these readily available and widely used dendritic scaffolds, poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM, Dendritic Nanotechnologies) constitute candidates of choice that have been extensively exploited by many groups of glycochemists, notably for the rapid synthesis of highly branched glycodendrimers. Since the pioneering synthesis of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers proposed by Tomalia et al. using a divergent growth procedure, these attractive molecules have constituted an exciting new class of macromolecular and highly branched architectures with well-defined size, shape, and geometry. They have drawn much interest in several research areas. 284, 288 Accordingly, PAMAM-based dendrimers, having built-in surface amine functionalities, have been the first and most frequently used scaffolds for attachment of sugars. The very first example of saccharide-substituted PAMAM dendrimers was proposed by Okada and coworkers, who described the synthesis of ''sugar balls'' 532 via amide bond formation, starting from sugar lactones (531). 387 Although this process is a straightforward manipulation, it suffered from the disadvantage of sacrificing the reducing sugars, which alternatively served as extended linkers (Scheme 50).",

            "text": "Thiourea Linkages. Attachment of saccharide units to the surface of PAMAM through thiourea linkages offers one of the most efficient ways to develop multivalent ligands quickly and efficiently for the study of protein-carbohydrate interactions. Historically, Lindhorst and Kieburg first published the simple and efficient coupling of different low-generation polyamine scaffolds, including PAMAM, to b-D-gluco-, aand b-D-manno-, b-D-galacto-, b-cellobio-, and b-lacto-configured glycosyl isothiocyanates. 388 An improved version, using a hydrophobic aryl aglycone, later permitted the syntheses of the first four generations of monodispersed neoglycoconjugates having up to 32 mannoside units (534). p-Isothiocyanatophenyl a-D-mannopyranoside 533 389 was used as key precursor (Scheme 51). The resulting glycodendrimers were evaluated as ligands for the phytohemagglutinins from Con A and Pisum sativum (pea lectin), using ELLA and turbidimetric analyses. The relative binding data indicated that incorporation of terminal a-substituted mannoside residues furnished glycodendrimers showing an up to 400-fold increase in binding capacities. Moreover, their ability to bind and form insoluble carbohydrate-lectin complexes was also demonstrated by radial double immunodiffusion and turbidimetric assays, and their capacity to precipitate selectively their homologous protein receptors from crude lectin mixtures made them convenient tools for the rapid and simple isolation of proteins. 390 The same procedure was successfully adapted by the same group a few years later, allowing the introduction of p-isothiocyanatophenyl b-D-lactoside onto PAMAM scaffolds to study their relative binding behavior toward the family of galectins, the influence of the generation, and the binding-site orientation of receptors. 391 In 1997, a similar but simplified procedure, involving aqueous solutions that and avoiding protecting groups, for the synthesis, from methylthiourylene a-D-mannopyranoside or the aromatic derivative, of a G(2) PAMAM dendrimer containing up to six peripheral mannosyl residues was proposed. 392, 393 Parallel investigations by Thompson and Schengrund involved the synthesis of glycodendrimers from poly(propylene)imine and Starburst (PAMAM) dendritic scaffolds, and provided potent inhibitors of CT. 394 using the PITC derivative of oligo-GM1. The IC 50 s values were determined for the oligo-GM 1 -PITC dendrimers, native GM 1 , and the oligosaccharide moiety of GM 1 (oligo-GM 1 ), and studies revealed that the glycodendrimers inhibited binding of the CT to GM 1 -coated wells at molar concentrations 5-to 15-fold lower than native GM 1 and more than 1000-fold lower than that of the free oligosaccharide. G(2) and G(3) sialic acid-containing PAMAM glycoconjugates with p-isothiocyanatophenyl a-sialoside (487) (Fig. 50 ) as precursor have also been described by Zanini and Roy, and their lectin-binding properties evaluated. 395 Preliminary turbidimetric studies with G(2) and G(3) a-thiosialodendrimers, presenting 16 and 32 peripheral sugar units, respectively, demonstrated their ability to bind the slug lectin from LFA, showing well-organized precipitation patterns. Furthermore, their relative efficiency to inhibit the binding of HRPO-labeled LFA to human AGP (orosomucoid) was determined by a competitive ELLA. Interestingly, an increase in multivalency resulted in a steady increase of inhibitory potential, with IC 50 values in the nanomolar range (2.89 and 1.13 for G(2) and G(3), respectively) corresponding to an $ 210-fold jump in inhibitory potential over the monomeric analogue. Subsequently, Baker and coworkers evaluated similar sialic acid-conjugated G(4) PAMAM structures as a mean of preventing adhesion of three influenza A virus subtypes, and furnished one of the first documentations of the function of dendrimer conjugates as antiinfective agents in vivo. 396 HAI in vitro showed the glycodendrimers to inhibit some specific influenza subtype strains at concentrations 32-170 times lower than those of sialic acid monomers. The in vivo studies also demonstrated the ability of the glycodendrimers to protect against experimental infection by influenza A X-31 H3N2 virus in mice.",

This was suggestive of a glycoside cluster-effect (enhanced local concentration). As with G(1) and G(2) glycodendrimers, G(3) was too small for multivalent binding to occur (chelate effect). Dendrimers G(4) to G(6) showed a two orders of magnitude increase in activity against the tetrameric Con A, indicating that multivalent binding was occurring. It is also possible that the change in shape from circular [G(1)-to G(3)-PAMAM] to spherical [G(4) to G(6)] caused the observed binding enhancement. 398 Further studies led the same group to the efficient incorporation of more complex saccharide units such as aMan-(1!2)Man disaccharide 535, manifesting the fact that dimannose functionalized G(3) and G(4)-PAMAM dendrimers 536, having an average of 26 and 48 peripheral groups were very competent for the recruitment of cyanovirin-N (CV-N), an HIV-inactivating protein that blocks virus-to-cell fusion through high mannose-mediated interactions (Scheme 52). 399 Finally, a subsequent investigation provided the first example of the use of glycodendrimers as model systems for studying carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions (CCI). 400 More particularly, lactosylated PAMAM dendrimers with various peripheral carbohydrate numbers, depending on the generation, were synthesized to examine the CCI of lactose with mixed Langmuir monolayers containing GM 3 and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Thiourea ligation between glycosyl isothiocyanate derivatives and the aminated dendritic core, following standard protocols afforded glycodendrimers containing appropriate amounts of lactose, which were further capped with poly(ethylene)glycol chains or other carbohydrates. The results corroborated the concept that lactosyl dendrimers were engaged in a CCI with GM 3 in a Langmuir monolayer. This CCI was dependent on both the carbohydrate density and the density of glycolipid within the monolayer. Moreover, a specific CCI was observed only in the presence of calcium ions and when at least one-fifth of the monolayer was composed of GM 3 .",

            "text": "Preliminary biological studies suggested that the newly synthesized Man-6-phosphate-containing dendrimers could act as adsorbents in related affinity chromatography, with an interesting potential to bind the purified goat-liver mannose-6-phopshate receptor (MPR 300) protein. Additional conjugation of various nonprotected glycosides has been similarly described using p-nitrophenyl activated saccharide esters to conjugate disaccharides or sialic acid components onto PAMAM scaffolds. 406 Reductive Amination. Sashiwa et al. have used reductive amination to provide dendronized chitosan-sialic acid hybrids containing different spacers (Scheme 56). [407] [408] [409] The sialic acid residues were successfully attached to each PAMAM dendrimer by reductive N-alkylation with p-formylphenyl a-sialoside 546, using NaBH 3 CN in MeOH, to furnish hybrid chitosans 547. However, since an excess of aldehyde must be used for high incorporation of sialic acid, the procedure also gave rise to double N-alkylation. The reaction thus gave complex sialic acid constituents, affording undesired mixed structures. To circumvent these drawbacks, N-methylamino derivatives (see Scheme 46) have been subsequently used for the reductive amination, and sialodendrimers have been prepared to target the immunoglobulin exposed Siglecs. 410 Nucleophilic Substitution via Incorporation of Haloacetamido Groups. In 1996, Zanini and Roy described the design and synthesis of a novel family of symmetrical dendrimers presenting even valencies between 2 and 16 residues, based on a 3,3 0iminobis(propylamine). 411 The synthetic approach was based on convergent assembly of suitable multibranched dendrimers containing N-chloroacetylated end groups to provide electrophilic species that could readily react with thiolated carbohydrate derivatives. Many synthetic benefits emanated from this strategy. First, the method was general, high-yielding, and readily amenable to such existing commercially available amine-terminated dendrimers as PAMAM that could be similarly treated with chloroacetic anhydride. Second, the synthesis of this dendritic family presented a viable alternative to PAMAM dendrimers, avoiding the need for large excesses of the reagents commonly used to ensure complete conversion. More importantly, these Scheme 56. Synthesis of dendronized chitosan-sialic acid hybrids. [407] [408] [409] structures are not susceptible to base-catalyzed retro-Michael degradations, in contrast to classical PAMAMs, since the substituents are not b-carbonyl positioned. The authors thus accomplished the efficient preparation of dendritic a-thiosialosides 551-553, starting from the AB 2 -type core 3,3 0 -iminobis(propylamine) (548), which was subsequently transformed to afford various symmetrical N-chloroacetylated dendrons, such as tetramer 549 (Scheme 57). A slight excess of thiosialoside 550 allowed the synthesis of glycodendrimers under mild conditions. They were deprotected to afford the dendritic architectures containing between four (551, Scheme 56) and up to 16 sialoside residues (552, Fig. 67 ), respectively.",

            "text": "The same group conducted a systematic study of similar but tethered sialodendrimers with even valencies between 4 and 12 (553), based on the same AB 2 core 548, and according to the same synthetic strategy. 412 The potential of these sialodendrimers to cross-link and precipitate LFA was confirmed by preliminary turbidimetric analysis. When tested in enzyme-linked lectin inhibition assays using human AGP (orosomucoid) as coating antigen, and HRPO-labeled LFA for detection, tetravalent dendron 551 showed IC 50 values of 11.8 nM, while 552 presented a higher value of 425 nM. On the other hand, these assays indicated that for the corresponding tethered dendrimers, the inhibitory potency increased with a corresponding increase in valency. The highest IC 50 value was obtained for 553 (8.22 nM) and constituted a 182-fold increases in inhibitory potential over the monovalent 5-acetamido-5-deoxy-D-glycero-a-D-galacto-2-nonulopyranosyl azide used as standard (IC 50 of 1500 nM). The same group then extended this approach using solid-phase chemistry. 413 Despite the demonstration that PAMAM dendrimers can exhibit up to 256 functionalized scaffolds are not always the ones with the highest protein-binding activity. In fact, less-functionalized ligands may often present optimal potencies. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon has been suggested and highlights the fact that at high loading, the peripheral saccharide portions might become less accessible to proteins because of an increase in steric hindrance. Another hypothesis is based on the drawbacks of using large dendrimers bearing aromatic aglycones, which can intramolecularly undergo p-stacking, thus further tightening the saccharide units at the dendrimer surface. Furthermore, solubility problems are often encountered with PAMAM dendrimers bearing more than 64 arylated mannoside moieties. Straightforward solutions to this problem have been addressed in the following publications describing the synthesis of sialoside dendrimers 554, where the glycans are interspaced by TRIS residues used as ''dummy'' functionalities ( Fig. 68) . 335 Aiming to validate these concepts, Wolfenden and Cloninger conducted the controlled preparation of a series of heterobifunctionalized mannoside and hydroxyl-G(3) to G(6)-PAMAM dendrimers 555 (Fig. 69) . 414, 415 A systematic study was addressed of the effect of carbohydrate loading on the activity of the dendrimer for a lectin and the influence of the conjugates' size. The degree of functionalization of mannose-hydroxyl groups via thiourea linkages was controlled by the stoichiometric amount of isothiocyanate derivatives of comparable reactivity. MS data allowed determination of the average number of mannose surface residues for each dendrimer generation. Hemagglutination assays were performed by adding rabbit erythrocytes to preincubated solutions of Con A and varying the concentrations of deprotected dendrimers. Comparison of the fourth through sixth PAMAM generations with different loading of surface mannose residues suggested that the binding efficiency was the highest for all generations at 30% to 50% loading. The most interesting observation was that the highest activity did not correlate with the maximum sugar loading, but rather occurred at slightly closer packing of the sugars as the generation increased, suggesting that unfavorable steric interactions precluded optimal binding at high carbohydrate density.",

Polysulfated dendrimers 570 were obtained by random sulfation of 568, and the average number of sulfates was determinated by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The in vitro studies of their effectiveness at inhibiting infection of U373-MAGI-CCR5 cells by HIV-1 Ba-L indicated that the sulfated glycodendrimers were better inhibitors than those of the nonsulfated compounds, but not as effective as the sulfated dextran control 566.",

The ability of 570 to inhibit infection of cultured indicator cells by HIV-1 was compared to that of dextran 566. The results showed that 570 inhibited HIV-1 IIIB as well as dextran sulfate (a known potent inhibitor of HIV-1 infectivity) with EC 50 values in the nanomolar range, and both were comparable in their ability to inhibit HIV infection of both X4 and R5 indicator cells. Furthermore, cytotoxicity studies revealed that neither the glycodendrimer nor 566 were toxic to the cells at the highest concentration (3 mg/mL) tested. Critical parameters such as the number and the position of sulfate groups (especially at C-3), which may constitute a key structural component of an efficient inhibitor, were clarified by this study.",

These nanocontainers ensured efficient entrapment of the bioactive drugs ($ 45%), which allowed their prolonged release profile for up to 144 h (vs. 24 h with PPI). The toxicity of these systems was generally found negligble. In cellular-uptake experiments, MPPI interacted with the lectin receptors present on the surface of MT2 cells or monocytes/macrophages, leading to cellular uptake of drugs 12 times higher than that of the free drugs. Furthermore, this phenomenon may be responsible for the significant, but preliminary anti-HIV activity displayed by MPPI. Despite these promising results, further studies are needed to consider those encapsulated systems as potent carriers for efficient control and targeting the delivery of anti-HIV drugs. c. Hyperbranched Boltorn Dendrimers.-Hyperbranched dendritic Boltorn polymers (Perstorp Speciality Chemicals) are also useful scaffolds, which have been used for the multivalent presentation of various functional groups. Their selection is based on the fact that second, third, and fourth generation polymers (H20, H30, and H40, respectively) are commercially available at a low cost since they are prepared in bulk quantities by polymerization. They are, however, polydisperse. 423, 424 Nevertheless, they can also be synthesized by a simple and iterative approach, using pentaerythritol (572) as the central core and 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propanoic anhydride (bis-MPA anhydride, 573) (Scheme 61). Deprotection in acidic media furnished G (1)-Boltorn polymer (574) To mimic the natural organization of high-mannose structures notably present in pathogens, mannosylated glycodendrimers obtained from these multivalent scaffolds have been synthesized. The commercial hyperbranched polymers of the second, third, and fourth generations were first functionalized with succinic anhydride (576) to furnish poly(acid) 577, which was then capped with 2-aminoethyl a-D-mannopyranoside to give mannosylated dendrimers of various generations [580 for G(3) (Fig. 71) ]. Preliminary studies of these glycodendrimers, perfectly soluble under physiological conditions and nontoxic against several cell lines, evaluated their interactions with Lens culinaris lectin (LCA). 425 The same group demonstrated that these mannodendrimers block the interaction between DC-SIGN and Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein. 426 Interestingly, dendrimer 580, containing an average of 32 peripheral mannosides, was able to inhibit selectively the DC-SIGN-mediated Ebola infection in an efficient dose-dependent manner (IC 50 of 337 nM), and showed no inhibitory effect in infection experiments using DC-SIGN-negative cell lines. These results showed that 580 was a potent inhibitor of Ebola infection mediated by DC-SIGN both in cis and trans (intra-and inter-cellular) presumably via the same inhibition mechanisms involving the interaction between the lectin and the viral envelope. In addition, a carbohydrate-dependent inhibitory effect was confirmed and a multivalent effect of two orders of magnitude demonstrated, since the monovalent manoside was able to inhibit this interaction at only millimolar concentrations.",

A general and facile strategy for functional-group introduction at defined positions on dendrimers is best achieved when dendrimers are synthesized stepwise. From this perspective, Sharpless, Hawker, and their group have provided an example of sophisticated, multifunctional materials that can be constructed in a stepwise, yet facile manner, using the efficient ''click'' methodology, and with a fashion-controlled strategy toward unsymmetrical glycodendrimers in which two distinct moieties (targeting and detection probe) were placed at the chain ends. 254 Dendritic block copolymers up to the fourth generation were coupled via the key step of Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition to prepare rapidly these dual-purpose and multifunctional materials without use of protecting groups. The orthogonal synthetic approach was based on 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propanoic acid (bis-MPA), which constitute the main building block in synthesis of the commercial Boltorn dendrimers. The corresponding bis-MPA anhydride (573) provided access to alkyne ester 583 and azide ester 584 by condensation with the appropriate alcohol (Scheme 63). Removal of the protecting groups and subsequent condensation by ''click chemistry'' allowed the generation growth of the core and afforded the asymmetrical structure 585 having a diol as the focal point.

AB 2 and AB 3 Subunit-containing Glycodendrimers.-(i) Aromatic AB 2 Systems.

Polyazido dendritic scaffolds 589-593, containing up to 16 peripheral azido functions were synthesized by successive formation of amide linkages between dendritic subunits.

The sugar heterogeneity was incorporated in order to increase the biological activities of the dendritic architecture and afford potent new antiadhesin agents against P. aeruginosa. Turbidimetric assays indicated that glycodendrimers possessing a minimum of four fucoside residues on the same side showed rapid cross-linking abilities with tetrameric P. aeruginosa PA-IIL lectin, by forming insoluble complexes. As expected, heterodendrimer 598 containing 4 fucosides and 4 galactosides had the ability to recognize both binding-site domains of PA-IL and PA-IIL.",

One of the first examples of glycodendrimers based on AB 3 building blocks was proposed by Stoddart et al. who designed dense multivalent neoglycoconjugates in which the carbohydrates were located at the periphery of short peptidic chains emanating from an aromatic central core and TRIS-containing branching system. 229 The convergent approach was adopted, with preliminary construction of dendrons based on initial glycosylation of the three hydroxylmethyl groups of TRIS (1) with glucose (Scheme 64). The availability of the single free amino group in 1 following deprotection enabled further elaboration through formation of amide bond. This could be accomplished directly with triacid 599 or, preferably, to avoid steric problems through the intermediacy of the 3,3 0 -iminodipropanoic acid-derived dendron 240. The glycine-derived glucosylated dendron 240 was thus connected with trifunctional scaffold 599 to afford glycodendrimer 600 decorated with up to 18 peripheral glucosides in a single step. Scheme 64. Convergent strategy for the construction of glucosylated dendrimers using TRIS as the branching component. 229 The authors then prepared even larger dendritic derivatives employing two different, yet closely related, convergent accelerated strategies. 304 The resulting D-glycopyranoside-containing glycodendrimers (602), bearing up to 36 saccharide residues, were obtained in good yields by a so-called 12 \u00c2 3 reaction sequence, involving three equivalents of dendritic wedge 601 (12-mer) and one equivalent of the trifunctional core 599 (Scheme 65). This advanced strategy circumvented the problem of incomplete dendrimer formation arising from limited reactivity of the core and accessibility impeded by the decreased interstitial space around it. High-generation glycodendrimers were thus obtained with very precise molecular sizes and shapes, and were completly monodisperse, despite the densely packed surface groups.",

In addition to typical advantages encountered for dendrimers, multivalent carbosilane architectures offered (i) synthetic simplicity to extend the generation at will and thus provide access to derivatives of definite molecular weight and number of terminal functions, (ii) the neutral nature of dendritic scaffolds having chemical and biochemical stabilty, and (iii) biological inertness. These dendrimers (603-606), displaying unique shapes (fan-shape, ball-shape, and dumbbell-shape, respectively) were called ''SUPER TWIGs'' and are presented in Fig. 74 . The same group studied these ''SUPER TWIGs'' as therapeutic agents for treatment of infections by Stx-producing E. coli O157:H7, and demonstrated their inhibition potential. 430 SPR studies showed that dendrimers 604 and 606 presented very low K D values of 4.2 and 1.4 mM, respectively, for STL-I, while the value for 603 was 30 times higher. This indicated that ''SUPER TWIGs'' 604 and 606 bound directly with high affinity to the STL-I B-subunit. In addition, six trisaccharides situated at an appropriate distance (span of $ 30 \u00c5 from the central silicon core) in one molecule allowed full embrace of the predicted Gb 3 -binding sites (CBPs 1 and 2 notably) and were sufficient for high-affinity binding. Furthermore, in vivo inhibitory effects of the ''SUPER TWIGs'' on the lethality of intravenously administred SLT-II in mice, indicated that 604 was a better candidate than 606 for this specific application. SLT-II was used in this study because it is more toxic than SLT-I both in vitro and in vivo, and clinically more significant. The assays indicated that 606 completely supressed the lethal effect of STL-II when administrated along with the toxin: 604treated mice survived more than 2 months without any pathological symptoms, whereas 100% of nontreated mice died within 5 days. The biological results suggested that 604 suppressed the lethality of SLT-II by diminishing the deposition of SLT-II in the brain and consequent fatal damage. Also, 604 protected mice from a challenge with a fatal dose of E. coli O157:H7, even when administrated after establishment of the infection. In the light of these results, a unique dual mechanism of action was proposed to explain this spectacular efficiency: (i) 604 bound to SLTs with high affinity and inhibited its Gb 3 -dependent incorporation into target cells; (ii) it induced active uptake and subsequent degradation of SLTs by macrophages present in the reticuloendothelium.",

Examination of additional structural features allowed the identification of crucial structural parameters. A dumbbell-shaped structure in which two clusters of trisaccharides, symmetrically located through their hydrophobic core and having an optimal length of at least 11 \u00c5 was first required. This indicated that grouping of the trisaccharides was more important than the number of trisaccharides. In the dumbbell shape, at least six trisaccharides needed to be involved for in vivo activity, and terminal trisaccharides with spacers had to be branched from the same terminal silicon atom to be clustered in high density. These structural requirements were essential for the appropriate induction of macrophage-dependent incorporation and degradation of SLT-II, further supporting the pivotal role for this mechanism in the in vivo SLTs-neutralizing activity of ''SUPER TWIGs'' having optimal structure. Interestingly, the data demonstrated the crucial implication of the CBP 3 present on the SLT-II B-subunit, and showed that it was an essential and sufficient site for high-affinity binding of 605. In addition, the core length was a major structural parameter for perfectly embracing the three sites in a multiple way and, consequently, to provide an adequate hydrophobic volume for recognition by macrophages.",

The synthetic strategies leading to these nanostructures have also witnessed considerable progress, that including organometallic chemistry, chemoenzymatic build-up, silicon chemistry, and self-assembly. Most of the initial challenges in complete substitution by the carbohydrate, and structure determination, have been resolved. Undoubtedly, a fundamental contribution toward this goal has been the utilization of classical [1, 3] -dipolar cycloaddition, using the soft and efficient copper-catalyzed, coupling reaction of azide to alkyne. This method, extensively used in this field, has proven extremely versatile. An additional enhancement has been ''accelerated convergent strategies,'' offering clear synthetic advantages and ease of purification. An important addition to the arsenal of sophisticated glycodendrimer methodologies is the recognition that most complex carbohydrate epitopes can be advantageously replaced by simpler 438 saccharides, and most importantly by glycomimetics. In this way, by combining the multivalent scaffolding of carbohydrate ligands, together with their replacement by simpler but higher affinity mimetics, the research community has delivered very potent antiadhesin candidates against viral and bacterial infections, including HIV and Ebola viruses. Key to these discoveries and applications, glycodendrimers have permitted a better understanding and appreciation of the very complex nature of multivalent carbohydrate-protein interactions. The upcoming challenges must address the issues of fine-tuned specificity faced by numerous families of carbohydrate-binding proteins having common and conserved CRDs, such as those identified for instance in galectins and MBPs. Another challenge will be to determine the toxicities of glycodendrimers to allow development of safe therapeutic agents.",

Specific binding of SWNT-bound glycodendrimers to receptors was observed with the FITC-lectins: C. ensiformis agglutinin (Con A), Arachis hypogaea agglutinin (PNA), and Psophocarpus tetragonolobus agglutinin (PTA), which recognized [G(3)] Man-SWNTs 287a, [G(3)] Gal-SWNTs 287b, and Lac 287c, respectively (Fig. 32). Similar results were obtained with the corresponding [G(2)] glycodendrimers. In addition, experiments in which SWNTs were initially functionalized with a mixture of [G(2)] Man 287a and [G(2)] Lac 287c using various molar ratios, and then incubated with a 1:1 mixture of Texas Red-conjugated PNA and FITC-Con A, demonstrated that multiple epitopes displayed on SWNTs could bind simultaneously to discrete proteins. The [G(2)] Man-SWNTs 287a were then successfully engaged with FITC-Con A and CHO cells in the experimental protocol earlier employed to promote specific binding of modified SWNTs to the cell membranes. Similar results were obtained with the other [G(2)] glycodendrimer-functionalized SWNTs with corresponding labeled lectins. Finally, incubation of HEK293 cells with [G(3)] glycodendrimer-SWNTs conjugates did not affect their proliferation, in contrast to the unmodified SWNTs, indicating that glycodendrimers mitigated the cytotoxicity.Besides the preparation of glyconanotube conjugates by supramolecular interactions, another synthetic pathway commonly used involved covalent attachment of the saccharidic units on the CNT scaffolds. The progress recently recorded concerning the derivatization of unfunctionalized CNTs, allowing introduction of suitable anchoring functions at their surface, are the basis of this synthetic alternative.255 b.
