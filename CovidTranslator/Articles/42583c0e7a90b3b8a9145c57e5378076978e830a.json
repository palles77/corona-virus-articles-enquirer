            "text": "A new insect nidovirus (named Yichang virus) from the family Mesoniviridae was isolated, identified, and characterized from Culex mosquitoes in Hubei, China. Results showed a high number of viral RNA copies (up to 10 11 copies/ml) within 48 h in C6/36 cells. In addition, the titers of the Yichang virus reached maximal levels of 10 7 PFU/mL at 6 d post-infection (dpi). The virus produced moderate cytopathic effects when the multiplicity of infection ranged from 0.001-0.1 at 6 dpi, but did not replicate in mammalian cells. Under electron microscopy, the virion of the Yichang virus appeared as spherical particles with diameters of \u223c80 nm and large club-shaped projections. Although subsequent genomic sequence analysis revealed that the Yichang virus had similar protein patterns as those of other mesoniviruses, the nucleotide acids shared less than 20% BLAST query coverage with known viruses in the family Mesoniviridae, and showed a maximum sequence identity of 67% for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The putative protein sequences showed slightly higher identity (28%-68%), and the most conserved domain was RdRp. Based on the phylogenetic and pairwise evolutionary distance analyses, the Yichang virus should be considered a new species belonging to a currently unassigned genus within the family Mesoniviridae.",

Nidoviruses consist of approximately 80 virus species with a wide variety of hosts, ranging from crustaceans to mammals (Adams et al., 2016; Cowley and W.P., 2008; De Groot et al., 2012; Siddell et al., 2005) . Members of Mesoniviridae have been isolated from various mosquito species in Africa (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire), Asia (Vietnam, Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, and China), Australia (Northern Territory), and North America (USA) (Hang et al., 2016; Kuwata et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Nga et al., 2011; Thuy et al., 2013; Vasilakis et al., 2014; Warrilow et al., 2014; Zirkel et al., 2011; Zirkel et al., 2013) , thus suggesting a wide geographic distribution. To date, however, only one mesonivirus, the Nam Dinh virus (NDiV), has been reported in China (Zhou et al., 2017) . Based on phylogenetic and DEmARC (DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering) analyses using either replicase non-structural proteins or large subsets of replicase non-structural polyproteins (3C-like proteinase (3CL pro ) to O-methyltransferase (OMT) domains), Mesoniviridae has been divided into the genus Alphamesonivirus and one unassigned genus (Approved Proposal of the Mesoniviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, ICTV, see Adams et al., 2016) [http:// ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp].",

To acquire the terminal sequences, both 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 RACE were performed with high fidelity polymerase (Primer STAR Max Premix, TaKaRa, Japan). The 5\u2032 RACE procedure was conducted using the 5\u2032 SMARTer RACE Kit (TaKaRa, Japan), as per the manufacturer's instructions. For the 3\u2032 RACE procedure, reserve transcription using the 3\u2032RACE reverse primer (3\u2032RACE-Reverse: CGCACTCAGTCAGTTGCCGTTTTTTTTT) was performed to obtain an extended cDNA with a 20 nt barcode sequence, which was then used as the reverse primer (3\u2032RACE-R: CGCACTCAGTCAGTTGCCG) for the second PCR assay, with the forward primer (3\u2032RACE-F: ATAAGCATTGGGTCCAGAGTTGTCAAAC) designed based on the known sequence in the 3\u2032-terminal.",

Viral RNA copies of each sample collected at different time points were detected by real-time PCR. Amplifications were run on a MyiQ\u21222 Optics Module (Bio-Rad, USA) using a One Step SYBR Prime-Script\u2122 PLUS RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Japan). The standard reaction mixture contained 200 ng of sample RNA, 8 pmol of each primer, 10 \u03bcl of 2 \u00d7 One Step SYBR RT-PCR buffer, 0.4 \u03bcl of PrimeScript plus RTase mix, 1.2 \u03bcl of TaKaRa Ex Tag HS mix, and 4.8 \u03bcl of RNase free dH2O to a total volume of 20 \u03bcl. All samples were analyzed with primers (RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-F: TTCGGTCGCATATACACAGC, RdRp-R: ACTTGTGGTTGGGATTGTCAG). Samples were run in triplicate to reduce the risk of false positive or negative results due to technical errors. Preincubation was performed for 5 min at 42\u00b0C for reverse transcription, followed by 10 s at 95\u00b0C then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C for denaturation and 30 s at 60\u00b0C for annealing and extension. Fluorescence was measured at the end of each cycle after completion of amplification (Langner et al., 2014).",

The amino acids of these spike proteins were quite distinct from those of the other mesoniviruses, based on the low identity ranges of 36%-39% (Table 2 ). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that there were two post-translational cleavage sites, that is internal signalase and furin-type cleavage sites, in the spike glycoprotein precursor (Fig. 1c) , which have also been observed in other mesoniviruses along with many conserved features. The internal signalase cleavage site in the Yichang virus was predicted by SignalP4.1 and was Virus Research 240 (2017) 130-139 located at the site 213 KAHA 216 / 217 YTRIN 219 , which is conserved at the \"TRI\" residue (Zirkel et al., 2013) . The furin-type cleavage site was predicted by ProP1.0, and showed that the multibasic cleavage site 426 SRSKR/WDSS 434 (Yichang virus) was highly conserved among mesoniviruses (Zirkel et al., 2013) (Fig. S1 ). Alignment of ORF2a showed that the Yichang virus had 12 conserved cysteine residues (Fig. S1 ) and four conserved potential Nglycosylation sites across all mesoniviruses (Vasilakis et al., 2014) (Fig. 1c , Table 5 ). The nucleotide capsid protein (abbreviation N) was encoded by ORF2b without a TMD or N-glycosylation site (Fig. 1b) .",

Detailed analysis and comparisons of genome organization revealed some notable differences, such as the presence of block insertions of up to 390 nt (130 aa) in the 5\u2032 terminal quadrant of ORF1a compared with the CavV, Hana, Houston, Meno, (Vasilakis et al., 2014; Kuwata et al., 2013) , but share low amino acid similarities. For example, the common sequence \"SKRKGK\" has been detected in BTaV, KsaV, and KPhV at both the N-and C-terminuses and in DKNV on the N-terminus, but only partially (\"KGK\") found at the N-terminus in the Yichang virus, and not located in the Meno virus at all. The imperfectly repeated sequences (KAEE and RKGN) within each insertion region, which suggest possible origin through recombination or sequence duplication events, were not found in the Yichang virus (Vasilakis et al., 2014) . Moreover, this insertion feature is only found in the Asian strains, although its function remains unknown. Previous analysis of the evolution of nidovirus genomes concluded that genome expansion occurred in a wave-like fashion, in which the three major coding regions (OFR1b, ORF1a, and 3\u2032ORFs) expanded consecutively in a hierarchy that reflects the roles of their encoded proteins in the virus replication cycle (Lauber et al., 2013) . The newly isolated Yichang virus provides evidence that nidoviruses have an inherent capacity for genome expansion, most likely associated with the transitional retention of sequences that serve as a resource for the evolution of new functions. As shown in earlier research (Vasilakis et al., 2014) , the conserved pseudoknot structure is responsible for the activation of the \u22121 ribosomal frame-shift (as observed in our study, Fig. 5a ), rather than the stem-loop of the immediate downstream sequence of the RFS. The predicted structure of the Yichang virus featured only three relatively short regions of complementary pseudoknot domains instead of four, as previously reported (Vasilakis et al., 2014) ; therefore, we speculated that these three regions are important due to their strong conservation. It should be noted that a common 'slippery' sequence (CACUUUU) found in other members of Mesoniviridae was not detected in the Yichang virus, and the Yichang virus sequence could not be read through in this region. Thus, the mechanism of mesonivirus gene expression is still unclear.",
