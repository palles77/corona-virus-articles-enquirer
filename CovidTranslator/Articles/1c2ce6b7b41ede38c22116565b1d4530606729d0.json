Design: The group of subjects consisted of 1800 hospital practitioners and 73 quarantined patients undergoing hemodialysis. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) was administered to the practitioners twice, once during the hospital shutdown and again one month after the shutdown. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered to patients undergoing hemodialysis. Results: During the initial stages of the MERS outbreak, healthcare workers who performed MERS-related tasks scored significantly higher on the total IES-R and its subscales. In the second assessment of the high-risk group, the sleep and numbness subscale scores from the IES-R differed depending on the implementation of home quarantine, and the intrusion subscale scores differed depending on the performance of MERS-related tasks. Conclusion: Medical staff that performed MERS-related tasks showed the highest risk for post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms even after time had elapsed. The risk increased even after home quarantine. Prompt and continuous psychiatric intervention is needed in high mortality infectious disease outbreaks.",

            "text": "An outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection occurred in Korea from May to December 2015, resulting in 186 cases of infection, 38 deaths (20.4% of total cases), and 16,692 exposed individuals experiencing home quarantine for two weeks [1] . It was defined as a disaster and the management of the outbreak was led by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), which was then responsible for the oversight of our hospital. About 3.8% of 186 cases of MERS and 2% of 16,692 home quarantine cases were linked to our hospital. 0.1% of all hospital workers were confirmed to be MERS positive and 18.9% were home quarantined. Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, located in Seoul, shut down its artificial kidney center and implemented cohort quarantine after a patient undergoing hemodialysis for renal failure was confirmed on June 17, 2015 to have MERS, the first in our hospital and the 165th patient nationally. After the 167th patient with MERS was confirmed on June 19, 2015, it was decided, for the first time in Korea, that all 104 patients actively undergoing treatment in the artificial kidney center at X Hospital would be hospital quarantined in private rooms and receive inpatient care, and the hospital was immediately closed until July 13, 2015. According to research on other infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Ebola virus disease, many healthcare workers experience severe emotional stress during the outbreak [2] [3] [4] . It has also been shown that healthcare workers experience burnout, traumatic stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms even after the outbreak [4] . Previous research has found that the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was also increased among survivors of infectious diseases [5] .",

The higher scores persisted above 25 even after time had elapsed (related vs unrelated, 26.08 \u00b1 22.15 vs 17.0 \u00b1 14.09). Thus, this suggests that hospital workers who performed MERS-related tasks were at risk of experiencing PTSD-like symptoms even after some time had passed. While the trauma appears to play the most important etiological role in the PTSD symptoms, there are some predisposing vulnerability factors suggested, such as childhood trauma, personality disorder traits, an inadequate support system, comorbid psychiatric illness, and excessive alcohol intake [18] . Based on this, we assume that some respondents with persisting high IES-R scores during the second survey might have these vulnerability factors rather than the trauma itself, MERS-related task.",

However, both the home quarantine and the non-quarantine groups had mean IES-R scores of 25 or above, which can be categorized as reaching the threshold for PTSD diagnosis. This may be due to the fact that the first survey was conducted at the acute infection stage of the MERS outbreak, and that overall, respondents had high scores with a mean of 26.3. Although the mean IES-R scores in the second survey differed between respondents who were and were not home-quarantined (28.3 \u00b1 20.19 vs 20.74 \u00b1 19.74), the difference was not statistically significant. However, among the second survey respondents, the home-quarantined group had a mean IES-R score of 25 or higher, suggesting that the effect of home quarantine is strong enough to result in levels that would categorize them with a PTSD diagnosis, even after the acute infection period. In the assessment of the high-risk group determined from the first survey, the IES-R sleep and numbness subscores tended to be higher in the home-quarantined group (p = .03) during the second survey. This is consistent with the results of a study conducted during the 2014 Nigerian Ebola viral disease outbreak, which examined the psychological distress of survivors and their close contacts and found that loss of sleep over worry was the second most frequent complaint [19] . Thus, taken together, we suggest that even after time has passed following the acute infection period, sleep and numbness symptoms are persistent in healthcare workers and survivors, emphasizing the importance of assessment and management.",

In the present study of hospital quarantined renal patients, the proportion of depression assessed using an abbreviated MINI was 5.5%, while when it was assessed using HADS was 15.1%. The proportion of patients with GAD assessed using the abbreviated MINI and HADS was 11%. Patients undergoing hemodialysis, who received care while being quarantined for a month at the hospital after the MERS outbreak, showed a good level of adjustment and had low rates of reporting psychological distress (Table 3 ).

Second, as only a survey method was used for the hospital workers, qualitative methods, including interviews, could not be simultaneously conducted. Third, the survey was limited to the MERS outbreak, and did not consider other potential variables, such as preexisting psychiatric conditions or individual personality issues before the outbreak. Another limitation is that the sampling of this study was voluntary and conducted by e-mail and mobile devices. Therefore, the possibility of a self-selection sampling bias as a factor accounting for the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity should be considered. Despite these limitations, this study examined the medical staff and patients at a hospital directly affected by the MERS outbreak, and demonstrated the effect of stress caused by MERS on their sociopsychological health.",
