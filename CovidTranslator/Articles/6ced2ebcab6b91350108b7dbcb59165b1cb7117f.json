Studies on 2-cyano aziridines assigned an additional role to the cyano group for their pharmacological activity. In fact, the CN residue has been reported to react fast with cysteine at room temperature, behaving directly as the inhibitor of the active site of the cysteine proteases. 7 We found that N-protected O-sulfonyl hydroxylamine derivatives 8 in the presence of inorganic bases can behave as good aziridinating agents of EWG (electron-withdrawing group) functionalized alkenes. 9 Therefore the latter were converted in high yields into their corresponding N-acyloxy aziridines bearing the most common EWG and different alkyl or aryl groups. These compounds can be regarded as interesting precursors of various natural or unnatural aminated compounds. Moreover, it is known that aziridines are activated toward nucleophilic ring opening not only through the protonation of the aziridine nitrogen but also by N-acylation. 10",

Addressing our interest in the synthesis of more complex peptidomimetic structures, the selective removal of the Boc protecting group results in a crucial step for obtaining a new functionalization site. Classic acidic conditions are not suitable for Boc removal, due to the presence of labile functional groups. The use of BF 3 $Et 2 O 17 gave free aziridines, but in low yields. Finally, the deprotection reaction was successfully carried out using TBAF/THF 18 and the deprotected 2-cyano aziridinyl peptides 3 were obtained in the yields as reported in Table 2 , after purification by flash chromatography.",
