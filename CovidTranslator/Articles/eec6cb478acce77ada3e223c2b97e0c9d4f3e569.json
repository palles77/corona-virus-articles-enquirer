If time permits, SARS -CoV-2 nucleic acid testing and chest CT scanning should be performed. The need of quarantine is based on the results of these examination.

For healthcare providers involved in suspected or conformed COVID-19 cases, level 3 infection control precautions (consists of disposable hat, medical masks (N95 or above), powered air purifying respirators (PAPR), scrubs, disposable gloves and disposable shoe covers) should be practiced throughout the perioperative period. Clinical observations should be carried out closely after their clinical involvement. If there are exposure risks during the care, at least 14 days of isolation should be mandated 7 .",
