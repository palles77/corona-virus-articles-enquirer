Helicobacter apparently does not cause disease in all ferrets, but is linked to severe lymphocytic plasmacytic inflammatory gastric lesions, diarrhea, anemia, and chronic wasting. Diarrhea can be black and tarry when Helicobacterassociated ulceration is present (Fig. 2) . Helicobacter can be difficult to completely eradicate. As reinfection is common, the organism must be eliminated from all contact animals as well [3, 4] . Gastric biopsies of ferrets that have undergone Helicobacter treatment can reveal healing ulcers, fibrosis, and other evidence of gastric damage that may explain why Recent work in humans and laboratory animal models indicates that Helicobacter is not confined to the stomach and duodenum, and may play a role in inflammatory disease along the entire GI tract. In mice, inflammatory bowel disease is directly linked to the presence of certain subspecies of Helicobacter. It is currently unknown whether this link exists in the ferret, but must be considered [5] [6] [7] . Proliferative bowel disease is thought to be caused by an organism similar to that causing proliferative ileitis of pigs and hamsters. Older literature refers to the causative agent as a Campylobacter-like organism [2] . However, experimental infection with Campylobacter jejunum failed to produce lesions of proliferative bowel disease [8] . The organism was later tentatively identified as Lawsonia intracellularis. However, a more recent study showed that lesions typical of proliferative bowel disease could be produced by coinfection of ferrets with an intracellular Desulfovirbio species and coccidia [9] . Typical symptoms include chronic diarrhea with or without blood or mucus, tenesmus, and possible rectal prolapse. Weight loss and dehydration typically follow [2] .",

Canine distemper virus can also be identified through immunohistochemistry of ante-mortem intestinal biopsy specimens. In 1993, breeders and veterinarians recognized an outbreak of diarrhea later termed epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE). Typical presentation included profuse green diarrhea with excessive mucus. Although morbidity was typically high, mortality was generally low with supportive care. Older ferrets with a concurrent disease were often most severely affected. Typical history included an onset of diarrhea in existing pets shortly after introduction of new, apparently normal, ferrets into the household. Incubation period is typically 48 to 72 hours. Older ferrets that recover from ECE often developed chronic diarrhea and wasting [14] .",

            "text": "Of 135 cases of ferret GI organ and lymph node biopsies submitted to an exotic animal pathology laboratory, 92% reported mild to severe inflammation (Zoo and Exotic Pathology Service, Drs. Reavill and Schmidt, personal communication). Of these submissions, 73% reported symptoms related primarily to the GI tract, such as vomiting and diarrhea. The rest reported less specific symptoms such as weight loss and anorexia, or no symptoms recognized at all. In the latter cases, samples were most often collected during exploratory surgery to investigate adrenal disease, or other non-GI indication. Severity of the lesion did not always correlate with severity of clinical symptoms. Spiral organisms consistent with Helicobacter sp. were identified in gastric samples with varying types and severities of inflammatory infiltration [5] . It has been speculated by Johnson-Delaney that ferrets may have aberrations with one or more tumor suppressor genes.",
