Therefore, artificial tears and blindfolds are used as conservative treatment to Korean J Pediatr 2018;61(10):332-337 prevent eye dryness. The use of corticosteroid, alone or in combina tion with antiviral agents such as acyclovir or valacyclovir, has been reported to be effective in some cases of Bell's palsy; however, the efficacy of this treatment, especially in children, remains unclear. Steroids may reduce inflammation, neural edema, and nerve compression in the facial canal. 4) In adults, treatment with corticosteroid has been demonstrated to have significant benefits, especially if used early in the course of illness. 5, 6) In contrast to adults, the natural course of Bell's palsy in children is not well documented. There is a relative lack of research on the incidence, etiology, treatment strategy, recovery period, and prog nosis of Bell's palsy in children. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and etiology of Bell's palsy, and to examine the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment by comparing the treated and nontreated groups retrospectively.",

The caregivers wanted to confirm the absence of any abnormalities. Therefore, we have given enough explanation and then proceeded with the MRI after obtaining consent. Brain MRI was performed in 91 patients (91%) with Bell's palsy. Twentynine patients (31%) with Bell's palsy showed abnormal MRI findings, that is, thickening and/or enhancement of the facial nerve (Table 2) . Eleven patients (12%) were found to have MRI abnormalities that were not associated with Bell's palsy, such as maxillary or ethmoid sinusitis.",

However, the duration from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 2.9 days in patients under 8 years and 2 days in patients older than 8 years (P=0.03) ( Table 4 ). This suggests that children who were 8 years of age or older complained of symptoms themselves; therefore, the duration between symptom onset and hospital visit was shorter. Severity improvement was 2.1 in the patients under 8 years and 2.0 in those who were 8 years of age or older. Good outcomes were observed in 52 of 54 patients (96.3%) under 8 years.
