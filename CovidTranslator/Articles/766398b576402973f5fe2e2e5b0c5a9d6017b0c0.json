As I prepare to retire from the position of Director of Public Health and Health Officer for our nation's most populous county, I reflect on the time that has passed between that day and now.",

However, as I completed my residency in pediatrics, it became clear to me that to solve the problems of the patients I saw day after day, medicine must be complemented by broader approaches to supporting health at individual, family, and community levels. I became convinced that I could make a greater difference in the health of patients and their families by working at the population level, although it meant giving up the gratification that comes from helping patients one at a time.",

After a year of consulting on how to improve governmental public health in Los Angeles County and collaborating with other public health experts to develop many recommendations that were adopted by the county governing body, I accepted the job as county Director of Public Health. Public health was housed within the larger County Department of Health Services and constituted a small portion of its workforce and budget. Public health issues and concerns were often overshadowed by constant crises in health services financing and quality of care. These uniformly took precedence over public health's efforts to hire new staff and to strengthen internal capacity in areas such as chronic disease control, environmental health, and analytics.",

Local news channel KCBS-TV aired an investigative report that used hidden cameras to reveal egregious food safety violations in Los Angeles restaurants, attracting considerable media attention and provoking public outcry. The news coverage inspired strong public support for holding restaurants more accountable for food safety. A visible restaurant grading system, previously unfeasible due to almost certain opposition by the politically strong restaurant association, was now possible. We were able to develop a system that both changed the incentives for retail food establishments and protected the public's health. Restaurant letter grades (A, B, C), prominently posted at the entrance of all food establishments, quickly became an identifiable trademark of public health. These simple letter grades helped establish a public health \"brand\" and distinguished the field from the direct delivery of health care services. This event also illustrated the importance of our ability to respond rapidly to public health needs. Indeed, being nimble and politically sensitive are important keys to advancing public health programs, whether for health protection, disease prevention, or health promotion.",

For me, it was important for public health to have a face, and that the face was the Health Officer, who under state law had broad responsibility and authority. I believe that in every community, Health Officers should be seen as the leader responsible for protecting human health. In the role of Health Officer, I've made many media appearances focused on educating the public about current health issues and teaching people how to better protect themselves from infectious and chronic diseases, environmental hazards, and other health threats. Visibility has also meant increasing the department's presence at the state and national levels. The involvement of local Health Officers at state and national levels is critical because they give authoritative voice to health problems at local levels, from environmental threats to substance abuse to food. Such local-level problems are often difficult to address due to barriers embedded in state and federal laws or regulations.",

We have modeled how to be an ally in counterterrorism efforts, helping draft a memorandum of understanding with the FBI and staff the Joint Regional Intelligence Center, a cooperative effort to centralize federal, state, and local activities related to responding to suspected terrorist threats.

I have been criticized for advocating for a visible role for public health on controversial issues such as limiting the marketing of sugar-sweetened beverages to children and for advocating that menus of fast food restaurants list calories and composition of their items. I have also been criticized for allocating too few or too many resources to a particular health problem or to 1 or more racial groups or geopolitical units and for not being sensitive enough to the concerns of the organizations we regulate. If you are committed to a proactive health-promoting agenda, you cannot avoid criticism. While a public health perspective or warning may not always be welcome or palatable, it is only by consistently basing policy recommendations and decisions on the best science that the department has become a respected resource for elected officials. In 2002, Tom Frieden, who then directed the New York City Public Health Department, and I organized the Big Cities Health Coalition (BCHC), based on the concept that urban centers share unique opportunities and challenges. The BCHC includes 20 of the largest local public health departments in the United States and is focused on building partnerships, exchanging ideas and best practices, and facilitating program and policy development by member departments. Just as I have focused locally on establishing my department in Los Angeles as the local voice of reliable health information and data, an important role for the BCHC is to identify and analyze the best science and collectively advocate for policies and programs that can improve health at the population level. To be an effective advocate for public health in big cities, the BCHC needs to be the \"go-to\" resource for questions from legislators on health-relevant policy and programmatic issues.",

As such, large metropolitan area public health departments are often the first to recognize and develop strategies to address the most burning issues of the day.

Our work with the City of Los Angeles highlights the importance of support and vision from elected of-ficials; we worked closely with local agencies on the development of the Health and Wellness chapter, as well as on other health-promoting initiatives. A specific example of collaborative planning is that we have made significant progress in transforming many Los Angeles neighborhoods to become more walkable and bikeable through strategic partnerships with other county agencies, local businesses, and community groups. These efforts, among others, have led to the recent recognition of Los Angeles as a bike-friendly community for the first time in 2012 1 after being referred to as \"an almost pathologically bike-unfriendly city\" by Slate Magazine in years prior. 2 Working with elected officials requires sensitivities to their political needs and priorities. Most elected officials, whether in the executive or legislative branch of government, face reelection every 2 to 4 years. Compare this time horizon with those of public health initiatives such as those focused on reducing the rate of obesity, reducing the toll of combustible cigarettes, or reducing exposure to environmental carcinogens. Making changes that will impact these health problems can take decades to show results. Meeting both public health and political goals requires a balanced portfolio of programs and policies that includes those with a rapid political return to help politicians demonstrate progress aligned with the election cycle. For changes with long-term outcomes, public health officials must mobilize allies who can help convince politicians of the long-term benefits.",

While the relative contribution of different environments to health is debated, a commonly used allocation for its contribution to health outcomes is between 10% and 20%. 3 The public must also accept that health care, while important, cannot remedy many of our country's current health problems or improve our poor ranking in health status and key measures compared with other developed nations. Currently, the United States is ranked 26th in life expectancy and 31st in infant mortality out of 40 countries by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 4 To date, we have not yet succeeded in getting the layperson to grasp this critical issue. When asked to name the most important thing that can be done to improve health in Los Angeles County, my response is, \"That's easy: Increase the high school graduation rate.\" This response frequently elicits a blank look. People often do not understand the interconnection of education and health outcomes until they engage in discussions about income and literacy, and how these 2 factors are related to health and longevity.",
