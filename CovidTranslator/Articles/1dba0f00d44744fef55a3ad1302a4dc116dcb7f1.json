Among 566 children with AOM, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common virus identified in either middle ear fluid or nasal wash; it was found in 16% of all children and 38% of virus-positive children. Seventy-one percent of the children with RSV were one year of age or older, which was significantly older than all other viruses combined (P = 0.045). RSV infection was associated with the common bacterial pathogens causing AOM. Past efforts to develop vaccines for RSV have emphasized prevention of lower respiratory tract infection in infants, which is a more serious problem but less common than AOM. Our results suggest that RSV vaccines that work only against infection in older children may have value in preventing AOM, the most common pediatric disease.",

Moreover, children with recurrent AOM require frequent use of antibiotics, making AOM the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription in the United States [2] . As a result, AOM treatment has also contributed to the rapid emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Direct and indirect costs of AOM are estimated to exceed 4 billion dollars per year in the United States [3] .",

Several studies have shown that RSV is the most common virus associated with AOM as well as lower respiratory tract disease in young infants [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The past efforts at development of RSV vaccines have largely targeted the short term benefit against lower airway diseases seen during primary RSV infection, such as acute bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia in infancy. In these efforts, the investigative community has largely ignored to value of prevention of recurrent RSV infections which manifest as less severe diseases such as URI. lt is well known that URI in children can result in bacterial super-infections of the upper airway such as AOM and sinusitis. These diseases, although less severe, are far more common than RSV infection of the lower airway [12] .",

However, the use of antigen detection test for RSV in both MEF and NW was essential because unlike other respiratory viruses, RSV is relatively labile leading to low sensitivity of viral culture compared to that of various antigen detection techniques [12] . In the study of NW samples, we only had one case of influenza virus and two cases of adenovirus that were detected only by the antigen detection tests but not by culture.

The rates of re-infection by age 3, 4 and 5 years are 45%, 33% and 50%, respectively [19] . Most of the re-infections, however, are restricted to the upper airway. Our previous studies and those by other investigators suggest that recurrent infection of the upper airway with RSV leads to AOM in older children [20] [21] . Therefore, RSV vaccines for AOM would need to show efficacy against recurrent RSV infection but not necessarily need to be effective against primary RSV infection in young children. Indeed, the strategy to vaccinate older children may overcome the problem of ineffective immune responses to RSV vaccines in young infants which is in part due to the presence of maternal antibodies and the relative immaturity of the immune system [22] .",

In a small study of 109 premature infants given passive immune prophylaxis with intravenous RSV-Immune Globulin (RSV-IG), the incidence of AOM was reduced by about 80% [27] . However, this polyclonal antibody preparation from pooled human plasma donors also contained antibodies against other viral and bacterial pathogens of AOM which did not allow the evaluation of RSV-specific protection. In contrast to RSV-IG, palivizumab, an RSVspecific monoclonal antibody preparation, was shown not to provide protection against AOM [28] ; this may be due to the fact that palivizumab does not protect against RSV replication in the nasopharynx. There is optimism, however, that the next generation of monoclonal antibody preparation, motivizumab (MedImmune Inc.), which is highly effective against controlling RSV replication in the nasopharynx, may provide protection against AOM. A cold-adapted, live intranasal RSV vaccine has been tested, but this vaccine produced URI, leading to cessation of further studies [29] . Additional attenuation may therefore be needed before future studies can be conducted. Englund and Anderson have summarized the various RSV vaccines that have been tested in the past and the newer vaccine candidates that can be considered for protection against lower and upper airway disease, including AOM [30] [31] .",

In view of the demonstrated benefits of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines, we strongly recommend their use for reduction of AOM in children. As there are no currently licensed vaccines for other bacterial pathogens of AOM, vaccines targeted against respiratory viruses have the advantage of providing protection against such bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, viral and bacterial vaccines together may be able to provide a better benefit than either vaccine alone. Another potential advantage of viral vaccines is that the benefit could extend beyond AOM to other bacterial super-infections that follow virus infections such as acute sinusitis, acute bacterial bronchitis, and even bacterial pneumonia.",

Efforts are needed to develop vaccines that protect against RSV-associated AOM and other bacterial complications. Experience with influenza virus vaccines suggests that effective RSV vaccines could better protect against AOM. There are several hurdles in developing RSV vaccines against AOM, including demonstration of effectiveness in preventing recurrent URI due to RSV in older children.
