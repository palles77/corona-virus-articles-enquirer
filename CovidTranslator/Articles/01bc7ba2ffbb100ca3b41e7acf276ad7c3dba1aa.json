Furthermore, significant economic losses can result from this disease due to high mortality rates, high medical costs, and low weight gain. To avoid a fatal outcome of the disease, it is crucial that vulnerable calves are identified as early as possible. Interleukin-6 is described as an early and reliable prognostic marker in several diseases. In this study, 20 scouring calves were tested by ELISA for their IL-6 serum concentrations. Samples were collected twice, at the beginning of diarrhea and 7 to 10 d later.",

A receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to determine the prognostic value of IL-6 for the progress of clinical symptoms. At the beginning of diarrhea, the IL-6 concentration was significantly higher in nonrecovering calves compared with those that recover 7 to 10 d after the onset of diarrhea. Interleukin-6 proved to be a useful additional parameter in the clinical examination. High initial IL-6 values can support the decision for closer monitoring and an adapted therapeutic strategy for the respective calves. This may help to prevent unnecessary animal suffering and reduce economic losses.",

Infectious and noninfectious causes can lead to severe diarrhea in calves.

Biotechnical measures directly after birth included disinfection of the umbilicus and application of earmarks. Four liters of colostrum was fed to the calves via tube feeder within the first hour of life. The colostrum came from the farm's colostrum bank and was controlled for sufficient quality with a colostrometer. Within 24 h after birth, newborn calves were brought to a special calf location, which was geographically separated from the barn for the milk-yielding cows. The newborn calves were sheltered outdoors in igloos individually and were fed pasteurized waste milk ad libitum in the first week after birth.

Subsequently, all liquid was removed and Detection Reagent A (biotin-conjugated antibody specific to IL-6) was added for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The plate was washed 3 times with wash solution (1\u00d7) and Detection Reagent B (avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase) was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. The plate was washed 5 times with wash solution before substrate solution (TMB substrate) was added for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. Color development was stopped with stop solution (H 2 SO 4 ) and optical densities were measured in all wells at 450 nm in the Sunrise microplate reader (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland) . For data analysis, average optical densities were calculated and blank reduction was performed. Standard curves were generated and sample concentrations were determined using the CurveExpert 1.4 software (CurveExpert, Daniel G. Hyams, Hixson, TN; https://www.curveexpert.net/). A detection limit of 1.56 pg of IL-6/mL was reported by the kit manufacturer. The coefficient of variation for the intra-assay test precision was <7%.",

Data are displayed as means \u00b1 2 SE. lated to handling stress during sampling rather than to diarrhea, as it was similar in both groups. An increase of neutrophils due to stress was already described for cattle in cases of shipping and heat stress (Kegley et al., 1997; Mitlohner et al., 2002) . The differential blood count, measured by the CellDyn 3500 Analyzer, revealed increased numbers of monocytes when compared with the reference values. However, manual counting of blood smears could not confirm the monocytosis. The CellDyn 3500 Analyzer classifies cells by measuring volume and granularity. It is likely that the number of monocytes was overestimated by mistaking them for large lymphocytes (Stoeber and Heubner, 1967) . The detection of diarrhea-causing pathogens revealed differences between the first and the second sampling time point in both groups (recovering, nonrecovering). In the recovering group, 5 calves still shed either BRV or C. parvum at the second sampling time point, although none of them showed diarrhea. This was described in other studies also, were BRV shedding occurred up to 11 d after infection, whereas diarrhea only lasts 7 d (Vega et al., 2015) . Similarly, C. parvum detection in feces was shown to be not always connected to diarrhea in the corresponding animals (Bjorkman et al., 2015) . In the nonrecovering group, 2 animals showed a BRV infection at the second sampling time point, which had not been apparent at the first sampling time point. It was suggested that this was due to a secondary infection, which is frequently described in neonatal calf diarrhea (Bartels et al., 2010; Silverlas et al., 2010) . In the classification of calves as recovered or nonrecovered, the pathogen detection was less important than the results of the clinical examination when focusing on the establishment of a prognostic marker.",

Because calf age differed between the 2 groups, age was evaluated additionally. In a multivariate logistic regression model none of the variables IL-6 and age and showed significance. A possible interaction between these 2 variables was not observed. However, the univariate logistic regression model for IL-6 showed a significance influence of this variable in predicting a prolonged course of diarrhea and was therefore regarded as the most reliable model in this investigation. The odds to develop a prolonged course of diarrhea increase by 14% for each unit of IL-6 and model could explain 34% of the variance. In literature, several other factors are discussed that increase the risk for diarrhea (Pare et al., 1993; Wiest and Klee, 1998; Bendali et al., 1999) . Birth weight and calf housing (e.g., open barn vs. closed barn) were identified as potential risk factors (Pare et al., 1993; Al Mawly et al., 2015) , whereas IgG serum concentrations seemed to have no effect (Pare et Scouring calves (n = 20) were grouped by their clinical recovery status 7 to 10 d after the onset of diarrhea (recovering group, n = 11; nonrecovering group, n = 9).

The AUC was used to measure the accuracy of IL-6 in distinguishing recovering from nonrecovering animals. A value of 1 was regarded as a perfect test, whereas a value of 0.5 corresponds to random chance. The AUC value of 0.808 confirmed IL-6 as a good test for the estimation of the prognosis. Furthermore, the ROC analysis allowed the definition of a cut-off value. For the establishment of IL-6 as a prognostic marker, the sensitivity was given priority over the specificity, as a high number of false positive classifications are less important than a high number of false negative classifications. In practice, this means that it is better to monitor a calf more closely that is misclassified as nonrecovering than to overlook a calf that is prone to develop a prolonged course of diarrhea. The cut-off was set at 38.7 pg/mL, with a sensitivity of 77% and specificity 82%, as this was the concentration with the most appropriate balance between sensitivity and specificity.",

It is recommended that scouring calves displaying IL-6 values above 38.7 pg/mL should be given special attention, as they were prone to develop a prolonged course of diarrhea. These results underline the prognostic potential of IL-6, which was already shown for adult cattle in cases of postpartal endometritis and coliform mastitis (Nakajima et al., 1997; Ishikawa et al., 2004) . Therefore, IL-6 seems highly valuable to forecast complications and possibly life-threatening progression of an infectious disease in cattle.",

Elevated IL-6 values may lead the veterinarian to the decision to monitor scouring calves more closely and to adapt the therapeutic strategy accordingly. Thereby animal suffering and economic losses could be avoided. As the animals in our study only showed infections with BRV or Cryptosporidium parvum, further investigations are needed into all relevant pathogens for neonatal calf diarrhea [e.g., BCV, enterotoxic E. coli encoding F5 (K99) fimbriae].",
