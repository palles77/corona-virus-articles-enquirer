If IBV has the similar characteristics, the peptides with HI activity should be able to inhibit virus infectivity. Therefore we further tested if these phages possessed inhibitory activity in IBV infected cells. Human cell line HeLa was selected to be the host cells because we have proved that freshly digested HeLa cells were susceptible to IBV infection. In fact, this study also performed confirmation of IBV replication in HeLa by amplifying S gene with RT-PCR, sequencing S gene and observing virus particles with electron microscopy (data not shown).

Because the isolated peptide contains only 12 aa residues, it would be possible that the HI activity of its phage is attributed to the steric hindrance of the phage. Although this hypothesis may borrow the support from the evidence that the binding sites for its cellular receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N and for sialic acid-containing receptor in erythrocytes are located on different portions of the S protein in TGEV [21] [22] [23] , the exact mechanism remains to be clarified.",
