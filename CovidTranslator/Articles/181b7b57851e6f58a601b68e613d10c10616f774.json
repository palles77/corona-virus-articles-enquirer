There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. : bioRxiv preprint B cell responses in recovered patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: A six-year follow-up study.",

However, some recent human Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recent SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus (Lu et al., 2020) . It has a genome size of ~30 kilobases which, like other coronaviruses, encodes for multiple structural and non-structural proteins. The structural proteins include the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. With SARS-CoV-2 being discovered very recently, there is currently a lack of immunological information available about the virus (e.g., information about immunogenic epitopes eliciting antibody or T cell responses). Preliminary studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is quite similar to SARS-CoV based on the full-length genome phylogenetic analysis (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) , and the putatively similar cell entry mechanism and human cell receptor usage (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Letko & Munster, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Due to this apparent similarity between the two viruses, previous research that has provided an understanding of protective immune responses against SARS-CoV may potentially be leveraged to aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2.",

In addition, multiple studies have shown that antibodies generated against the N protein of SARS-CoV, a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein during infection (Lin et al., 2003) , were particularly prevalent in SARS-CoV-infected patients (X Liu et al., 2004; J. Wang et al., 2003) . While being effective, the antibody response was found to be short-lived in convalescent SARS-CoV patients (Tang et al., 2011) . In contrast, T cell responses have been shown to provide long-term protection (Fan et al., 2009; Peng et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2011) , even up to 11 years post-infection (Ng et al., 2016) , and thus has attracted more interest for a prospective vaccine against SARS-CoV [reviewed in (W.

These nucleotide sequences were aligned to the GenBank reference sequence (accession ID: NC_045512.2) and then translated into amino acid residues according to the coding sequence positions provided along the reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (orf1a, orf1b, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, and ORF10). These sequences were aligned separately for each protein using the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment program (Katoh & Standley, 2013) . Reference protein sequences for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were obtained following the same procedure from GenBank using the accession IDs NC_004718.3 and NC_019843.3, respectively. (Pickett et al., 2012) by querying for the virus species name: \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus\" from human hosts. We limited our search to include only the experimentally-determined epitopes that were associated with at least one positive assay: (i) positive B cell assays (e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)based qualitative binding) for B cell epitopes; and (ii) either positive T cell assays (such as enzymelinked immune absorbent spot (ELISPOT) or intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) IFN-\u03b3 release), or positive major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding assays for T cell epitopes. Strictly speaking, the latter set of epitopes, determined using positive MHC binding assays, are candidate epitopes, since a T cell response has not been confirmed experimentally. However, for brevity and to be consistent with the terminology used in the ViPR database, we will not make this qualification, and will simply refer to them as epitopes in this study. The number of B cell and T cell epitopes obtained from the database following the above procedure is listed in Table 1 .",

This tool uses the distribution of MHC alleles (with at least 4-digit resolution, e.g., A*02:01) within a defined population (obtained from http://www.allelefrequencies.net/) to estimate the population coverage for a set of T cell epitopes. The estimated population coverage represents the percentage of individuals within the population that are likely to elicit an immune response to at least one T cell epitope from the set. To identify the set of epitopes associated with MHC alleles that would maximize the population coverage, we adopted a greedy approach: (i) we first identified the MHC allele with the highest individual population coverage and initialized the set with their associated epitopes, then (ii) we progressively added epitopes associated with other MHC alleles that resulted in the largest increase of the accumulated population coverage. We stopped when no increase in the accumulated population coverage was observed by adding epitopes associated with any of the remaining MHC alleles.",

We checked whether this is also true at the level of the individual structural proteins (S, E, M, and N). A straightforward reference-sequence-based comparison indeed confirmed this, showing that the M, N, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have over 90% genetic similarity, while that of the S protein was notably reduced (but still high) (Figure 1a ). The similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, was substantially lower for all proteins ( Figure 1a ); a feature that was also evident from the corresponding phylogenetic trees (Figure 1b) . We note that while the former analysis (Figure 1a) was based on the reference sequence of each coronavirus, it is indeed a good representative of the virus population, since few amino acid mutations have been observed in the corresponding sequence data ( Figure S1 ). It is also noteworthy that while MERS-CoV is the more recent coronavirus to have infected humans, and is comparatively more recurrent (causing outbreaks in 2012, 2015, and 2018) (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/), SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV, which has not been observed since 2004.",

The SARS-CoV-derived T cell epitopes used in this study were experimentally-determined from two different types of assays (Pickett et al., 2012) : (i) positive T cell assays, which tested for a T cell response against epitopes, and (ii) positive MHC binding assays, which tested for epitope-MHC binding. We aligned these T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences. Among the 115 T cell epitopes that were determined by positive T cell assays (Table 1) , we found that 27 epitope-sequences were identical within SARS-CoV-2 proteins and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020) ( Table 2) . Interestingly, all of these were present in either the N (16) or S (11) protein. MHC binding assays were performed for 19 of these 27 epitopes, and these were reported to be associated with only MHC binding tests to identify the MHC alleles that bind to these 8 epitopes may reveal additional distinct alleles, beyond the five determined so far, that may help to improve population coverage.",

A total of 8,098 cases of SARS were reported globally, including 774 associated deaths, and an estimated case-fatality rate of 14-15% (https://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_07a/en/).

Consequently, the accumulated population coverage of these epitopes (see Materials and Methods for details) is estimated to not be high for the global population (59.76%), and was quite low for China (32.36%).

Our aim was to determine sets of epitopes associated with MHC alleles with maximum population coverage, potentially aiding the development of subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. For selection, we adopted a greedy computational approach (see Materials and Methods), which identified a set of T cell epitopes estimated to maximize global population coverage. This set comprised of multiple T cell epitopes associated with 20 distinct MHC",
