To better inform programmes and policies focused on preventing and treating LRIs, we assessed the contributions and patterns of risk factor attribution, intervention coverage, and sociodemographic development in 195 countries and territories by drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) LRI estimates.",

In GBD, infectious disease mortality, including that due to LRI, is among HIV-negative individuals. We categorised locations based on their burden in 1990 to make comparisons in the changing burden between 1990 and 2017 and evaluate the relative percent change in mortality rate, incidence, and risk factor exposure to explain differences in the health loss associated with LRIs among children younger than 5 years.",

Although improvements in indicators of sociodemographic development could explain some of these trends, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors are related to the rates of decline in LRI mortality. No single intervention would universally accelerate reductions in health loss associated with LRIs in all settings, but emphasising the most dominant risk factors, particularly in countries with high case fatality, can contribute to the reduction of preventable deaths.",

Yet, no country has a national pneumonia control strategy and pneu monia attracts a small fraction of international development assistance and research and development funding. 2 Several global initiatives have sought to fill this gap and provide guidance on the most efficient interventions to avert illness and mortality and to champion LRI as a pre ventable cause of death. [2] [3] [4] [5] These programmes have typically categorised risk factors and interventions into groups that are defined by the stage in the morbidity pathway at which they occur, including protection against illness, prevention of infection, and treatment of disease. 4, 5 The decline in under5 LRI mortality has not been universal and has varied between countries. 6 Under standing why it declined faster in some countries than in others provides specific, actionable evidence to further reduce disease burden. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) is a systematic, scientific effort to quantify morbidity and mortality, including LRIs and their risk factors. We used results from GBD 2017 to assess which countries have performed best in reducing under5 LRI mortality and compare countries on the basis of mortality rates, case fatality, and changes in risk factor exposure. This Article identifies countries where the change in under5 LRI mortality has been largest, and uses the expansive set of estimates produced for GBD 2017 to analyse these changes, aiming to assess how and why they have occurred and to provide a roadmap for strategies to accelerate declines in mortality.",

Several prominent global burden estimation groups, the WHO Maternal and Child Epidemiology Estimation group, and the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) have iteratively quantified the morbidity and mortality associated with LRIs. Based on these findings, several initiatives have sought to give guidance about effective ways to reduce health loss due to LRIs, including the Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea, The Missing Piece, and a 2013 Lancet Series about effective ways to reduce child mortality. We have previously published estimates of LRI mortality from GBD 2015 and 2016 and in those Articles, have looked at risks and interventions. We conducted a search in PubMed on April 30, 2019, using the search terms \"(\"lower respiratory infection\" OR pneumonia) AND mortality AND global AND risk AND trend*)\". After removing publications using GBD results, we found 49 articles, many of which reported on single risk factors or countries.

We use a conceptual framework to group these risk factors into categories of those that primarily prevent initial LRI episodes (such as the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) and those that primarily protect children with LRIs from dying (such as antibiotic therapy). A major component of GBD is producing internally consistent and externally comparable estimates for all locations and over time, which allows us to identify countries where the incidence or mortality has changed most rapidly and to evaluate the risk factors or interventions are most associated with these changes.

Individual countries or regions must consider their specific context to identify strategies to reduce LRI disease burden.

The estimation strategy for risk factors involved a counterfactual approach that quantifies the level of exposure to the risk factor in a population and the relative risk of LRI given exposure. Typically, the exposure in a population is modelled on the basis of surveys and scientific literature and the risk of LRI is derived from published metaanalyses. Childhood growth failure risks were estimated as a continuous exposure of the height or weight Z scores. Likewise, air pollution was considered a continuous exposure of the amount of fine particulate matter smaller than 2\u00b75 \u03bcm in diameter. Other risk factors, such as low vaccine coverage, are modelled when the exposure is a population prevalence of being exposed to that risk factor (eg, the population prevalence of being unvaccinated for low vaccine coverage). Descriptions of the riskfactor exposure models and relative risks are provided in the appendix (pp 13-66). Risk factors in GBD are part of a comparative risk assessment framework and are modelled independently. 8 Therefore, in our study, the burden associated with each risk factor can be considered as the LRI mortality that could be averted if exposure to that risk factor was eliminated. Since they were modelled independently, our analysis does not quantify the potential impact of combined interventions and combining riskfactor burden by summing risk factors is not appropriate and could lead to greater attribution than disease burden.",

Despite these declines, such progress has not occurred equally across countries, and LRIs remained the leading infectious cause of death among children younger than 5 years in 2017. In most locations, LRI incidence declined more slowly than mortality, suggesting that improvements in protecting against death are probably outpacing improvements in reducing the underlying risk of infection. Although SDI is strongly associated with under5 LRI mortality, changes in SDI were not strongly associated with changes in mortality rates between 1990 and 2017. At the global level, 93\u00b74% of under5 LRI deaths were attributable to a risk factor. Among risk factors estimated in GBD 2017, we have conceptualised the change in under5 LRI burden into two components, the changes in risks that predispose children to disease (prevention risk factors) and those that increase the risk of mortality given disease (protection risk factors). These categories are likely to partly overlap. For example, childhood growth failure, via immunological mechanisms, might make children both more likely to get sick and die from an LRI. Such a distinction is broad but provides a conceptual framework with which to assess the relationship between trends in risk factor exposure, mortality, incidence, and case fatality. One of the main findings from our study is that the drivers of change in LRI mortality are not universal and might be highly specific to each location and that strategies to reduce health loss due to LRI must be tailored to a given setting. For example, the three countries with the greatest absolute decline in LRI mortality rate were Niger (1019\u00b73 fewer deaths per 100 000 children), Laos (944\u00b74 fewer deaths per 100 000 children) and Afghanistan (919\u00b70 fewer deaths per 100 000 children). The Hib and pneumococcal vaccines were responsible for the largest percent change in Niger, whereas changes in childhood wasting explained more than 20% of the decline in Laos and Afghanistan, and lower exposure to household air pollution in Afghanistan decreased LRI mortality rate by 19\u00b73%. By contrast, the two countries that observed the largest relative decline in LRI mortality between 1990 and 2017, China and Turkey, had relatively small changes attributable to changes in risk factors. Under5 LRI mortality in China decreased by 91\u00b72% between 1990 and 2017, whereas the mortality rate decreased by 26\u00b72% because of changes in risk factor exposure. This suggests that other factors might explain the change in some countries.",

Interventions and structural policies that aim to improve childhood nutrition can play a substantial role in protecting children from dying because of infectious diseases, including LRIs. 5 China and Turkey have some of the fastest improvements in the Healthcare Access and Quality Index, a composite metric of amenable mortality. 18 This improvement in preventing amenable causes of death suggests that the healthcare systems in these countries have improved and are likely to have contributed to the rapid declines in LRI mortality. Access to care, adherence to treatment protocols, maternal education, appropriate technology, and adequate healthcare staffing have all been identified as predictors of under5 LRI survival 5 that were not quantified in this study and might be components of a comprehensive LRI treatment strategy.",

            "text": "Appropriate care for LRIs might also depend on the availability and utilisation of health care. Primary health care in some lowincome and middleincome countries has experienced challenges in funding, with general underuse of facilities and neglected human resources. Nigeria had the highest case fatality ratio globally in 2017 (5\u00b77%, 95% UI 5\u00b74-6\u00b70) but had average coverage of antibiotics, suggesting other factors might be driving the high rate. Nigeria is a country of complex demographic, geographic, and cultural characteristics with substantial variation in health and healthcare utilisation and performance indicators. 23 It has the highest population of any country in Africa and by far the most deaths due to LRI among children younger than 5 years. Yet, a review of published literature on child health interventions found only 18 papers from Nigeria. 24 Building evidence from highburden countries should be a priority and is essential to a complete understanding of health loss due to LRI. One qualitative study 25 revealed demandside barriers to healthcare utilisation in Nigeria, suggesting that costs, physical distance, cultural considerations, and knowledge of symptoms and warning signs might all play a role in delayed careseeking and could explain behaviours in other locations. In one study 26 of six countries in sub Saharan Africa, only 30% of care givers recognised fast breathing or difficulty in breathing as a symptom of LRI. Among several countries in western subSaharan Africa, the proportion of care givers who reported seeking treatment for symptoms of pneumonia ranged from 27\u00b74% in Chad to 73\u00b72% in Sierra Leone and was 41\u00b79% in Nigeria. 26 Appropriate care and treatment to protect against LRI mortality are important but the two risk factors responsible for the largest reduction in LRI mortality at the global level and for the largest prevention of incident episodes of LRI are Hib vaccine coverage and household air pollution. Vaccines have been an important part of LRI prevention in many countries. In 2011, 2% of US$30\u00b76 billion in international assistance for health spending was spent on pneumonia, and about 82% of that was through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, suggesting that nearly all pneumonia funding was for vaccines. 27 A different analysis found that between 2000 and 2015, pneumonia received approximately $3 billion in funding for research and development, compared with more than $38 billion that went towards HIV/AIDS research during the same time. 28 Of that $3 billion, about $839 million went to treatment, another $164 million to diagnostics, and $858 million went to vaccines. 28 Globally, Hib and pneumococcal vaccines were responsible for an estimated 11\u00b74% (Hib) and 6\u00b73% (PCV) decrease in LRI mortality. Although nearly every country has introduced the Hib vaccine in their immunisation programmes, several highburden countries such as Nigeria, Chad, and Somalia have not introduced the pneumococcal vaccine. Studies have shown substantial reductions in hospital admissions for pneumonia, invasive Hib, and pneumococcal pneumonia following vaccine introduction. [29] [30] [31] [32] Although more countries might introduce PCV with Gavi support, there is uncertainty regarding the sustainability of these vaccines among countries that approach graduation from Gavi. 33 The continued and expanded use of these vaccines have substantial impacts on under5 LRI mortality and should be prioritised as part of routine immunisation programmes to prevent these deaths.",

            "text": "Two other risk factors that are associated with preventing incident cases of LRI had opposite trends in burden attribution. Between 1990 and 2017, LRI mortality decreased by 8\u00b74% globally due to reductions in household air pollution but increased by 4\u00b71% due to ambient air pollution. A pair of systematic reviews and metaanalyses found that exposure to household air pollution from solid fuel use increased the risk of pneumonia among children younger than 5 years. 34, 35 A pair of randomised controlled trials found little statistical evidence of a reduction in pneumonia incidence with provision of chimneys 36 or cleaner burning cookstoves, 37 and several more studies investigating household air pollution and childhood pneumonia are in progress. 38, 39 This suggests that the provision of chimneys or cleaner burning practices does not result in a sufficient reduction of air pollution to translate into a reduction in health effects. This finding is consistent with the analysis and recommendations by the WHO guidelines. Rapid urbanisation in many countries and a shift from conventional heating sources, such as coal and wood, to natural gas have probably contributed to reduced exposure to household air pollution. 40 Reduced exposure to household air pollution was strongly associated with decreased incidence and mortality, particularly in highburden countries in our study. We have previously described the interplay between develop ment and ambient air pollution that is occurring in many countries that are rapidly urbanising and growing economically. 6 Preventing LRI cases and deaths should be a part of any policy conversation regarding the burning of fossil fuels, and focusing on health effects of carbonbased energy might be a powerful rhetorical tool in developing policy to reduce air pollution. [41] [42] [43] There are several limitations in this study. We have previously described some of the data gaps associated with LRI mortality modelling, specifically among countries with the highest estimated LRI burden. 6 All our estimates are reported with uncertainty intervals and these intervals are larger in areas where we have fewer data. We attempt to improve our models by using patterns from locations where we do have data and by the relationship between LRI mortality and covariates. Many of the covariates used in the mortality modelling are also part of the risk factor attribution. Risk factors in GBD are typically a combination of populationlevel exposure and the relative risk of an outcome. The exposure to each risk factor is a covariate in our model. This analysis is strengthened by our ability to use risk factors to predict time trends in LRI mortality. Yet, the risk factor exposure used at multiple points in this analysis are also modelled values, dependent on data availability. Although we have quantified several interventions for LRI healthloss and antibiotic use, we do not explicitly account for healthcare For WHO guidelines on indoor air quality see https://www.who. int/airpollution/guidelines/ household-fuel-combustion/ IAQ_HHFC_guidelines.pdf seeking behaviours, primary healthcare availability, and specific recommended diagnostics or treatments for LRI. Understanding patterns in diagnostics and the use of pulse oximetry, chest xrays, and oxygen therapy might reveal additional information about the drivers in LRI mortality trends. We do not have a modelled covariate for influenza vaccine coverage. Additionally, our model quantifies LRI deaths in HIVnegative people only because any deaths due to select infectious diseases, including LRI, among people with HIV, are classified as HIV deaths in the International Classification of Diseases; these deaths are captured in the overall HIV related mortality estimation in GBD. 1 To date, we have not separately quantified LRI deaths in HIVinfected people. As GBD is an iterative endeavour, we can examine this in our future work. The global reduction in under5 LRI mortality from 1990 to 2017 should be viewed as simultaneously a major public health achievement and as a call for renewed efforts to continue to reduce the burden of disease. Declines in LRI burden over time have been highly specific by location and are not fully explained by improvements in sociodemographic status alone. These results illustrate the contribution of improvements in air pollution, Hib and PCV vaccine coverage, child nutrition, and effective treatment to reducing disease and death due to LRI. Quantitative estimates of LRI incidence, mortality, and risk factor exposure can serve as a tool to sustain the progress made since 1990 and to design targeted strategies for countries where high LRI burden remains.",
