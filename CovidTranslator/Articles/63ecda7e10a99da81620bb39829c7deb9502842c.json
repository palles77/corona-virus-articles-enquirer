Finally, the HBV template mixed in the 10 l LAMP solution could be detected by SPRLAMP system in 17 min even at the detection-limited concentration of 2 fg/ml. We also analyzed the correlation coefficients between the initial concentrations of HBV DNA templates and the system response ( RU) at varying amplification times to establish an optimal amplification time endpoint of 25 min (R 2 = 0.98).",

Patients are at especially high risk when their serum viral load is higher than 100,000 copies/ml according to a report by the REVEALHBV (risk evaluation of viral load elevation and associated liver disease/cancer-hepatitis B virus) group (Iloeje et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2002) . It is therefore clinically desirable to develop a quantitative diagnostic method to provide a high-sensitivity genetic assay for routine checkups or even for self-monitoring at home. Although polymer chain reaction (PCR) (Carrino and Lee, 1995) has been used in many areas of biotechnology and serves as the gold standard for clinical diagnosis, it requires efficient control of thermal cycles and thus has higher instrumentation costs. PCR is also known to have errors caused by its hybridization mechanism (Cadwell and Joyce, 1992) . There are currently many research efforts devoted to miniaturizing the thermal cycler for point-of-care applications (Cooney et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011) . However, PCR still requires hours of operating time to have enough end products for detection because of the limits of thermal transition rate and thermal conductivity (Zhang et al., 2004) .",

It has a higher DNA yield rate (10 g/25 l) than traditional PCR (0.2 g/25 l) (Mori et al., 2001) . In addition, it has been demonstrated to have resistance to inhibitors in the blood (e.g., heme) because Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) DNA polymerase is used in the reaction (Poon et al., 2006) . At present, LAMP has been applied for fast screening tests for several infectious 0956-5663/$ -see front matter. Crown Copyright \u00a9 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Currently, the LAMP reaction is detected in real time either by measuring the turbidity of its DNA polymerization by-product (magnesium pyrophosphate, Mg 2 P 2 O 7 ) or by using a fluorescent indicator (Tomita et al., 2008) . Both methods are indirect detectors of amplification; both signals are proportional to the amount of produced DNA and the reaction time. Measurement of Mg 2 P 2 O 7 turbidity has one advantage: a simulated chemical reaction can be used to obtain Mg 2 P 2 O 7 for calibration purposes or internal quality verification without using real buffer medium and targeted DNA samples (Lee et al., 2008) . However, LAMP detection by turbidimetry is limited by in-homogeneity of particle size, uneven spatial distribution, re-dissolution of Mg 2 P 2 O 7 particles and turbid samples; these factors result in relatively low sensitivity in short reaction time (approximately 20 min). In addition, this posts even greater challenge for the detection of smaller reaction volumes with smaller reactant amounts, e.g., polymerase, dNTP, buffer medium and extracted samples. One way to bypass this limitation is to use the surface sensing method rather than the traditional volume sensing approaches.",

The reflected light intensity is affected by the dielectric property of the LAMP solution in the vicinity of the Au surface. Monitoring the changes in intensity of the reflected light gives a measure of the change in the refractive index and therefore a measure of the LAMP reaction. We have observed a difference of 3000 RU between the SPR signal maximum (3500 RU) and minimum (500 RU). A mechanical fixture with precision pins was constructed to hold the sensing cartridge at the desired position, allowing reflection and projection of the light to a CCD camera with a focused microlens (TV LENS 12MM 1: 1.4, Japan) . The temperature controller supplied current to the flexible heating filament. The heating filament was coupled through a copper plate, which acted as a heat capacitor to minimize fluctuations and ripples in the temperature inside the SPRLAMP sensing cartridge. This heating block was brought in close contact with the top of the sealed membrane to ensure a homogenous temperature inside the reactor. The heating block also avoided evaporation and condensation of the LAMP solution on the membrane surface during heating.",

Results show that the linearity of the PC prism compares favorably with the linearity of the glass prism; both prisms have a good correlation coefficient (R 2 > 0.99). The response value ( RU = 540.984) of the glass prism at 10% ethanol is slightly less than the response value ( RU = 612.728) of the PC prism. This difference is caused by the amount of reflective light energy absorbed by Cr film, an adhesive layer between the glass and Au film. The LOD is approximately 0.08% with the glass prism and 0.07% with the PC prism. The refractive index of the ethanol solution was computed using the binary mixing rule (Tasic et al., 1992) .

Fig. 4B shows the results of three repeated cycles between 25 \u2022 C and 65 \u2022 C. These results demonstrate the reversibility of SPR responses to temperature cycling. The RU changes are due to the temperature dependence of the refractive index of water. The difference of response values ( RU) between 65 \u2022 C and 25 \u2022 C was 178 \u00b1 1.5 RU for the PC prism and 177 \u00b1 1.4 RU for the glass prism. The 50 nm Au film coated onto the PC prism performed similarly to the 50 nm Au film coated on the glass prism; the film did not detach from the prism with temperature variance, even though the thermal expansion coefficient of PC substrate (70.2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 \u2022 C \u22121 ) (Serini, 2000) is greater than that of glass substrate (approximately 7.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 \u2022 C \u22121 ) (Brown, 2004) . The difference of SPR responses between these two types of prisms was neglected. The time to increase temperature from 25 \u2022 C to 65 \u2022 C is approximately 5 min in our system. The 5-min temperature response time was used in a follow-up experiment. Since both prisms exhibit temperature-dependent changes in SPR measurements, it remains important to maintain a stable temperature for LAMP detection by SPR, stable temperature is necessary for LAMP detection by SPR.",

The SPR response is sensitive to temperature-induced refractive index changes in the micro-reactor. This approach can minimize fluctuations caused by environmental factors and thus provide better discrimination of the LAMP reaction. The traditional Kretcheman SPR chip uses matching oils for the coupling of an Au glass slide and a BK-7 prism. Our PC prism has the advantage of direct Au film deposition without the use of a glass slide. It thus provides easier and better integration with the PMMA cartridge and further reduces the cost of materials for disposable applications. We prefilled the micro-reactors with 10 l of premixed LAMP solution to fully immerse the gold film. This volume does not cause the reagent to overflow when we seal the micro-reactors with adhesive film. Whether the reaction chamber is tightly sealed or not can be verified by the SPR response curve. We have noticed that if the seal is damaged, the LAMP reaction will be stopped, possibly due to the evaporation of water changing the mixed volume ratio of the solution.",
