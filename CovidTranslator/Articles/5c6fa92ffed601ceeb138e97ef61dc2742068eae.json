Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and antiproteinase-3 antibodies are commonly found. Upper respiratory tract involvement causes frequently presenting symptoms like ulcers and bloody nasal discharge. Pulmonary manifestations may include coughing and haemoptysis. Subglottic or tracheal stenosis occurs in 9-16% of these patients at some point. 1 While being an uncommon cause of respiratory distress it may lead to life-threatening compromise of the airway in some cases. These lesions usually progress slowly allowing patients to adjust breathing over longer periods of time. 2 Seldom the onset of dyspnoea is acute, mimicking the features of allergic asthma, a common cause of respiratory distress.",

Heart rate increased to 170 bpm, yet without any relief of the respiratory distress. General anaesthesia was induced with 15 mg midazolam intravenous and 250 mg ketamine intravenous to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Laryngoscopy revealed no apparent obstruction, vocal cords were easily visualised but placement of the 7.5-mm cuffed endotracheal tube was hindered by distinct resistance that was finally overcome by repeated attempts of careful pressures. Even then, ventilation remained difficult with low tidal volumes of about 100 ml/breath. Expiratory measurement of endtidal CO 2 confirmed correct placement of the endotracheal tube and showed a considerably elevated partial pressure of >120 mm Hg. In order rule out/differentiate decreased respiratory compliance we administered a 1 mg/kg succinylcholine. This did not improve ventilation, although oxygen saturation improved gradually until reaching 100%.",

In our case, onset of dyspnoea was acute, mimicking the features of allergic asthma, a common cause of respiratory distress. The initial treatment was based on the most likely assumption of allergic asthma that was supported by the neighbour. After establishing the diagnosis of Wegener's in patients with acute dyspnoea, it is important to consider granuloma formation as a possible reason for airway obstruction. Therapeutic options range from conventional immunosuppressive therapy in limited forms to endoscopic or surgical excision. 2 We encourage all patients with known airway issues to carry an 'anaesthesia/ airway problem card' stating relevant past and present conditions. In this special case, an emergency coniotomy, for instance, may have been unsuccessful because the subglottic granulation tissue might have hindered access to the trachea.",
