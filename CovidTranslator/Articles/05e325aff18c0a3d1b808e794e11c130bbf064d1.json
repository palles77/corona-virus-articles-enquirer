Further, we provide a database of fluorescent dyes, antibodies, and reporter mouse lines that can be used in combination with a reporter influenza virus (Color-flu) for multicolor analysis. Setup of this model typically takes~30 min and enables the observation of influenza virus-infected lungs for >4 h during the acute phase of the inflammation and at least 1 h in the lethal phase.

            "text": "In vivo two-photon imaging is an analytical approach that can be used to visualize cell dynamics and hemodynamics in organs or tissues of live animals. Information in real time obtained by using this approach, such as changes in cell behavior and morphology, tissue localization, and blood flow, has revealed highly sophisticated and dynamic systems of living organisms. During in vivo imaging, the blood circulation in the tissue being observed is maintained; therefore, this technique is also effective for analyzing the migration and invasion of immune cells in the inflammatory environment. Observations in physiological environments deepen our understanding of host response mechanisms under both steady-state and disease conditions. Computed tomography, X-ray, and IVIS Spectrum (an in vivo imaging system) imaging methods have been used as non-invasive approaches; however, these techniques have low spatiotemporal resolution and have been able to estimate only the site of inflammation in an organ 1, 2 . Therefore, it is impossible to observe cellular responses of the immune system using these approaches. By contrast, a two-photon excitation laser microscope, the light source of which is a near-infrared laser that produces low damage to cells but has long-reaching depth in tissue, enables us to capture the movement of cells in living animals at high resolution. Two-photon imaging has been in use in biological science since the 1990s; it has progressed at a remarkable rate, and observation methods for various organs, including brain, liver, and lymph nodes, have been reported 3, 4 . In this protocol, we describe how to use it to image virus-infected lungs. We have previously demonstrated that this protocol works by using mice infected with mouse-adapted seasonal influenza virus (H1N1) or highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) 5 .",

            "text": "The lung, which is a respiratory organ, has contact with the outside environment and is an important organ for research on immunity to infectious diseases. In the seventeenth century, Marcello Malpighi discovered pulmonary capillaries and alveoli in the frog lung by using optical microscopy 6 ; now fluorescent reporter mice facilitate the study of disease models in conjunction with two-photon excitation microscopy (Table 1) . However, a challenge encountered when imaging the lung is that it is constantly moving during respiration. The lung has been stabilized in several ways during in vivo observation by microscopy, including bronchus clamping, prolonged apnea, gluing, and suction 7, 8 ; however, it is difficult to reduce motion artifacts due to lung respiratory movement under physiological conditions and hence to obtain high-quality images. Bronchus clamping can suppress respiratory motion artifacts of the lung lobe 9, 10 ; however, it is not suitable for long-term observation because it causes severe hypoxia. Although prolonging apnea is less invasive [11] [12] [13] , it does not allow researchers sufficient time to observe the lung for image acquisition by two-photon excitation microscopy, and the quality of the images tends to deteriorate over time. Gluing addresses the above limitations 14, 15 ; however, it can induce shear force injury and inflammation, which affect the interpretation of results. A suction window, which is currently the most commonly used stabilizing system during lung imaging, achieves moderate immobilization of the lung and high-quality images [16] [17] [18] [19] ; however, the observation period is limited to \u226412 h. Ex vivo imaging of lungs and in vivo imaging of trachea have also been performed as complementary methods 8 . Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to select and optimize the method best suited to the goal of the experiments and disease model.",

However, for viral respiratory diseases, such as influenza, other than an observation in a methodology report 20 , only analyses of the trachea in vivo [21] [22] [23] and isolated lungs had been performed 24 , with no analysis of the lung in vivo, until our recent publication 5 (Table 1) . Unlike ex vivo methods, which involve isolated or sliced lungs, in vivo imaging using two-photon excitation microscopy of live animals enables researchers to observe hemodynamics, migration and extravasation of immune cells, as well as interactions among immune cells during influenza virus infection. However, it is technically demanding to perform two-photon excitation microscopy of live influenza virus-infected lung, which exhibits severe inflammation, requiring the development of highly sophisticated, less invasive instruments and surgical techniques. In addition, when observing animals infected with pathogenic viruses, specialized facilities and instruments are frequently required to avoid the spread of the virus. Furthermore, because many types of immune cells infiltrate the infected lung in an inflammatory environment, it is necessary to distinguish the target immune cells from the infected cells by using fluorescent labels in the infected microenvironment. To detect multiple fluorescent signals excited simultaneously by a two-photon excitation laser, fluorochromes with different spectra and equal brightness must be selected; however, there is currently no comprehensive database of fluorescent reagents, fluorescent reporter viruses, and reporter mouse lines available for lung in vivo imaging. We therefore also provide a database of fluorescent dyes, antibodies, and reporter mouse lines that can be used in combination with a reporter influenza virus (Color-flu) [25] [26] [27] for multicolor analysis under pathological conditions in this protocol.",

The contribution of Ly-6G, which is expressed predominantly on murine neutrophils, to recruitment during inflammation remains a matter of debate. It has been reported that low-dose antibody treatment inhibited Ly-6G ligation and the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of inflammation 39 ; however, a more recent study indicated that Ly-6G knockout did not affect either neutrophil differentiation or recruitment to the site of inflammation in Catchup mice 32 .

This in vivo lung imaging system is based on the upright microscope LSM 780 NLO system, which is equipped with four different lasers (excitation at 405, 488, 543, and 633 nm) for confocal imaging and a two-photon excitation laser (excitation at 630-1,050 nm). To be able to perform the surgical procedure on the mouse, we replaced the sample stage with a large, flat one (microscope stage for in vivo experiment) as shown in Fig. 2b ,c. To efficiently excite multiple fluorescent proteins and fluorescent dyes simultaneously, the wavelength of the infrared laser should be set at 910 nm. All fluorescent spectra between the 410-and 695-nm wavelengths can be detected using a 20\u00d7 water immersion lens, and we record signals in lambda image stacks (0.13 frames per s, 1,024 \u00d7 1,024 pixels) and acquire z-stack images with z-depths of 5 \u03bcm (total of 10-\u03bcm z-depth). We perform spectral separation of the acquired lambda stacks by using the linear unmixing function of the ZEN software. Although the LSM 780 microscope system is controlled by a primary personal computer, we recommended adding >64 GB of RAM for appropriate imaging analysis.",

To observe the lungs of the mice with a thoracotomy, we place the ventilator with an airway pressure monitor and anesthesia machine for rodents in appropriate positions on the stage. We installed high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in the exhalation duct of the ventilation system (Fig. 2b,d) , and the operator wore a positive pressure mask (Versaflo Faceshields) and a Tyvek suit (Fig. 2e-g) to avoid exposure to the viruses. ! CAUTION The wavelength and power of the excitation laser should be adjusted appropriately according to the experimental conditions. Increasing the laser power enhances target signals and enables detection of second-harmonic generation (SHG), in which structures with repeating patterns lead to the formation of a signal. SHG is a useful phenomenon for visualizing collagen fibers in the lung without staining; however, it should be noted that the autofluorescence of lung tissue is also enhanced under excessive excitation conditions ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). When using this protocol, we did not perform experiments under which SHG occurs, in order to minimize autofluorescence; it is better to adjust the laser power according to the experimental purpose. When the wavelength of the excitation laser is too short, the autofluorescence signal becomes very strong and it is difficult to observe properly. By contrast, when the laser wavelength is too long, it becomes difficult to obtain a signal because of the short excitation energy (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). ! CAUTION Although color separation of emission using a conventional optical band-pass filter is also available for this protocol, multispectral imaging is a useful approach for simultaneously analyzing multiple targets by eliminating tissue autofluorescence and identifying fluorescent labels with overlapping spectra 40, 41 . In vivo two-photon imaging is performed under conditions of single stimulation with a two-photon excitation laser; limitations exist regarding available fluorescent reagents/proteins for multiple labeling of target cells and lung architecture. Therefore, we recommend using a multispectral approach to produce crosstalk-free images of fluorescence with overlapping spectra that cannot be separated by using band-pass filters. Before starting experiments, it is necessary to collect spectral signatures of the emission signal of each fluorescent reagent and protein as reference spectra under the same excitation condition as will be used in the experiment.",

When observing while using a multicolor fluorescent label, it is easier to analyze the detected images if the brightness level of each fluorophore is adjusted to make them similar. It is better to choose fluorescent dyes or proteins that possess high fluorescence stability for long-term observations (Tables 2, 4 and 5). We have found that use of MA-Cerulean-viruses or MA-Venus-viruses for infection produces influenza virus-infected cells with sufficient brightness (Table 3) .

If using reporter mice expressing a fluorescent protein such as GFP, which is regulated by an endogenous promoter, the expression level of the fluorescent protein should be confirmed.

To observe the interaction between different kinds of infiltrating immune cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes, double-reporter mice expressing fluorescent proteins with different spectra but similar brightness have a major advantage (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Video 3) .",
