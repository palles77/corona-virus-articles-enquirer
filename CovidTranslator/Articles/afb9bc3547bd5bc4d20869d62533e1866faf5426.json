Prototypic European, but not American, PRRSV antisera also recognized BPO3-P using western immunoblotting and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) procedures. However, gnotobiotically derived antiserum to an atypical American-origin PRRSV was reactive with BPO3-P by both IPMA and western immunoblot.

The viral etiology of PRRS was confirmed both in The Netherlands (Meulenberg et al., 1993; Terpstra et al., 1991) and in the United States with the isolation of two previously unknown PRRS viruses (PRRSV), a prototypic European PRRSV (Lelystad isolate) and a prototypic American PRRSV (VR-2332 isolate). These 50 to 60 nm enveloped RNA viruses Wensvoort et al., 1992) share common antigenic determinants but may be differentiated using both polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies (Nelson et al., 1993) . Serologic analysis of European and American swine naturally exposed to PRRSV has confirmed that geographically based antigenic differences do exist between most North American and most European isolates of PRRSV; these differences are consistent with those first noted between the Lelystad and the VR-2332 isolates Bautista et al., 1993) . There is some evidence, however, that antigenically intermediate PRRSV or possibly both prototypic antigenic types may exist within the North American swine population (Bautista et al., 1993) . PRRSV has been tentatively classified as an arterivirus, along with equine arteritis virus (EAV) and two other proposed members of that genus: lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) .",

We report here the expression and serologic analysis of a markedly hydrophilic portion of PRRSV ORF 3 (Lelystad isolate). This segment was of additional interest because comparison of LDV, EAV, and PRRSV ORFs 2 through 6 revealed that the ORF 3 protein products of these viruses would be the most divergent in size but potentially the most universally highly N-glycosylated of all the proteins encoded by those ORFs (den Boon et al., 199 1; Conzelmann et al., 1993; Godeny et al., 1993) . These features suggested to us that PRRSV ORF 3 might encode a glycoprotein mediating virus-host cell interactions; therefore, it might be a target of host defense mechanisms subjected to selective evolutionary pressure. We hypothesized that it might account in part for the geographically oriented antigenic differences between the majority of European and North American PRRS viruses, and that was the basis for this study.",

A 655 base pair (bp) cDNA segment was then amplified through 20 cycles of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Saiki et al., 1988 ) using a 5' primer located between positions 12,559 to 12,578 and a 3' primer (13,213 to 13,194) to which a Pst I recognition sequence had been appended (Fig. 1) . Following Xho I and Pst I digestion and gel purification, the PCR product was directionally ligated into a baculovirus polyhedrin gene transfer plasmid, pAcSG-HIS-NT (Pharmingen, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The resulting plasmid contained the 199 carboxyterminal amino acid-encoding portion of ORF 3 fused in frame to a 5' vector sequence encoding 27 amino acids including a polyhistidine domain. The resulting fusion polypeptide had a calculated mass of 25,984 daltons (26 kDa) . Following DNA sequence verification, recombinant plasmid DNA ( 2 ug) was cotransfected with Bsu 361-digested AcNPV baculoviral DNA (0.5 ug) (Pharmingen, Inc.) into a Spodopteru frugiperda SF-9 cell culture using a liposomal transfection reagent (DOTAP, Boehringer Marmheim, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Clonally purified baculoviruses expressing PRRS virus-immunoreactive material were identified by IPMA. Separate PCRs of cell culture fluids from monolayers infected by these cloned viruses were used to confirm the presence of the ORF 3 gene sequence and the absence of the nonrecombinant baculovirus polyhedrin gene sequence. The latter PCR employed primers spanning the polyhedrin gene insertion site (Invitrogen, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). One rDNA baculovirus, BP03, was used for recombinant protein production.",

The similarity between the RIPA and western immunoblot reactivity patterns of BP03-P using European and American PRSSV antigens and gnotobiotically derived convalescent swine antisera suggests that perhaps both linear and conformational ORF 3 epitopes may be involved in the antigenic differentiation of European and American PRRS viruses. Our data support the hypothesis (Bautista et al., 1993 ) that coexisting high Lelystad and ATCC VR-2332 PRRS virus antibody responses found in some American swine may result from infections with a virus of mixed antigenicity as opposed to dual infections with prototypic American and European-like PRRSV isolates.",

            "text": "Like the homologous predicted LDV and EAV ORF 3 proteins, the PRRSV ORF 3 protein contains the greatest number of sites for potential N-glycosylation of all the proteins encoded by ORFs 2 through 6 (den Boon et al., 1991; Conzelmann et al., 1993; Godeny et al., 1993) . N-linked glycosidic moieties have frequently been found important in mediating viral infectivity, in directing soluble and cell-associated host immune responses, in protecting critical viral protein epitopes from immune attack, and in interacting with viral polypeptide components to ensure correct viral glycoprotein conformational structure (Rademacher et al., 1988; Li et al., 1993; Grigera et al., 1991) . Attempts to produce observably deglycosylated and nonglycosylated forms of BPO3-P using both tunicamycin inhibition and enzymatic deglycosylation approaches indicated that the recombinant protein did not contain N-linked glycosidic modifications. These findings must be interpreted cautiously. Despite the theoretical potential for a high degree of N-linked glycosylation, the carboxyterminal portion of the native ORF 3 protein may in fact not be glycosylated. Perhaps more likely however, the aminotetminal peptide sequence omitted during BP03 construction may have represented a signal sequence required to direct nascent ORF 3 into the ER-Golgi complex for glycosylation during insect larval and SF-9 cell infections. Although insect cells and tissues are generally assumed to be glycosylation-competent, differences between mammalian and insect glycosylation patterns have been observed (Rademacher et al., 1988; Shimokawa and Smith, 1992; O'Reilly et al., 1992) and could also account for the data. The addition or removal of very small N-linked glycosides to the BP03-P protein might have been undetectable given the molecular size resolution of the western immunoblotting, but this is unlikely because viral N-linked glycosidic moieties are usually substantial in apparent molecular mass (Rademacher et al., 1988) . Regardless of the foregoing considerations, the ORP 3 of the Lelystad isolate clearly encodes epitopes recognized immunologically by the swine host during the course of both experimental and natural infections. Monospecific BPO3-P rabbit antipeptide antisera reacted by immunoblot but not by RIPA with a diffuse band of antigen (40-45 kDa) found repeatedly in virus-infected cell cultures. This material was specific to virus infected cells, but was apparently not of virus structural protein origin, because it was not detected by either RIPA or immunoblot using purified virus preparations. The difference between the RIPA and the western immunoblot performance of the rabbit antipeptide antisera using unpurified infected cell culture material may be due to the presentation of the relevant reactive linearized nonstructural virus protein epitopes under the conditions of the denaturing immunoblot but not under the milder conditions of the RIPA.",

The failure of monospecific rabbit BPO3-P anti-peptide antisera to react with PRRSV-infected cells is consistent with the ideas that the natural ORF 3 translation product may be conformationally (epitopically ) different from the recombinant BP03-P fusion protein, or that the native protein may be a nonstructural, perhaps soluble, virus gene product. Lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus, EAV, SHIV, and apparently PRRSV all possess three structural proteins including a nucleocapsid protein encoded by the 3' terminal ORP (Nelson et al., 1993) . The other two presumed PRRSV structural proteins are 19 kDa and 26 kDa in apparent molecular mass (Nelson et al., 1993) and are thus far removed from the 40-45 kDa band identified here. Although the precise identity and functional role of the PRRSV ORF 3 gene product thus remain enigmatic, a differential virus serotype-specific serologic response is clearly directed against it by swine exposed to PRRSV.",
