Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) is one of the members of the Herpesviridae family, which frequently associated with several diseases including herpetic stomatitis, recurrent herpes labialis, erythema multiform, cranial neuropathies, and oral squamous carcinoma. HSV-1 is capable of causing lesions at or near the point of entry into the body and also can establish a latent infection in sensory ganglia. Subsequently, the latency often increases the HSV pathogenicity [2] . Antiviral medications including Acyclovir, Famciclovir, and Valacyclovir are effective drugs for people suffering from HSV infections. Although these drugs suppress the recurrence rate and viral shedding through the effects on viral DNA replication, their drawbacks include renal failure, anaphylaxis, and hepatitis [3] . Also, a considerable amount of literature has been published on HSV resistance to these antiviral drugs.",
