In immunocompetent hosts, cryptosporidiosis is selflimiting but can have a fatal outcome in immunocompromised individuals. Cryptosporidium is one of the most common causes of waterborne diseases (recreational water and drinking water) in humans, a leading cause of moderate to severe childhood diarrhoea, and a major agent of diarrhoea in calves leading to high economic losses and up to 10 % lethality. So far, available treatment options are insufficient for both veterinary and human clinical disease cases. Here, we report for the first time that the novel bumped kinase inhibitor (BKI) 1294 targeting the calciumdependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) of Cryptosporidium is able to reduce the oocyst shedding of C. parvum by calves-its natural host-without obvious side effects.",

In humans, cattle and goats, it causes severe watery diarrhoea which is often self-limiting but can also have a fatal outcome. In young calves, C. parvum is the most common cause of diarrhoea affecting nearly every animal (G\u00f6hring et al. 2014) . Consequently, calves are supposed to be a major source of oocysts infecting humans especially in rural areas with poor sanitation and close contact between humans and livestock. A recent global enteric multicenter study (GEMS) identified Cryptosporidium sp. as the second most common pathogen in children with moderate to severe diarrhoea, and Cryptosporidium was significantly associated with an increased risk of death of 12-to 23-monthold children (Kotloff et al. 2013) .",

CpCDPK1 has an orthologue in Toxoplasma gondii which was shown to play a crucial role in invasion (Lourido et al. 2010 ). Consequently, BKIs have been developed to prevent invasion by inhibiting CDPK function (Lourido et al. 2010; Ojo et al. 2010; Johnson et al. 2012 ). In T. gondii, it has been shown that BKI 1294 selectively targets through TgCDPK1 by overexpressing a mutant form of TgCDPK1. Mutant T. gondii displayed decreased sensitivity to BKI 1294 (Ojo et al. 2010) . It was shown that BKI 1294 is a potent inhibitor of CpCDPK1 and prevents the invasion of host cells by C. parvum in vitro and the establishment of the disease in mice (Castellanos-Gonzalez et al. 2013) . However, C. parvum does not infect immunocompetent mice making the transfer of results from experiments using immunosuppressed mice to the natural host difficult. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that BKI 1294 reduces C. parvum oocyst shedding in its natural host.",

However, only minor differences in faecal consistency and dehydration could be observed between the treatment group and the control groups. This is due to the fact that the infection with C. parvum in general was moderate in terms of diarrhoea and dehydration even in the controls. Seven of the animals, in one of the two cohorts of this experiment, had bloody faeces, which is unusual for C. parvum monoinfection, making it likely that the animals were infected with undetected enteropathogens. Since severe cryptosporidiosis in calves may reflect a multifactorial aetiology (G\u00f6hring et al. 2014 ), we analysed the faecal samples for other common enteropathogens such as rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli K99 and Giardia with commercially available fast tests (rotavirus, coronavirus, E. coli K99 with strip tests (Bio X diagnostics), Giardia with an ELISA (ProSpecT\u2122)). The samples were negative for those pathogens. However, we cannot exclude the presence of other enteropathogens such as Clostridium perfringens that can cause enteritis. However, further studies are needed to evaluate if BKI 1294 would reduce symptoms in a setting were animals develop long lasting (>5 days) moderate to severe diarrhoea without coinfections. Since cryptosporidiosis is a multifactorial disease in which severe symptoms occur predominantly in co-infected animals (G\u00f6hring et al. 2014) , it would also be necessary to test if BKI 1294 would lead to an improvement with co-infections.",
