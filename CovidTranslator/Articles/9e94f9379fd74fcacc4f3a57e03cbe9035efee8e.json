In this study, the structure models of two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteases, coronavirus endopeptidase C30 (CEP_C30) and papain like viral protease (PLVP), were built by homology modeling. Ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir were then docked to the models, respectively, followed by energy minimization of the protease-drug complexes. In the simulations, ritonavir can bind to CEP_C30 most suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; lopinavir can also bind to CEP_C30 suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; darunavir can bind to PLVP suitably with slight conformation changes of PLVP. It is suggested that the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP.",

By the time of 14:50 on February 8, 2020, 34638 COVID-19 cases had been confirmed in China and 723 patients died from it, resulting in a mortality of 2.2%. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel species of non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus which can spread and distribute in humans and other mammals [1] . Previous studies have discovered that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a distinct clade from the \u03b2-coronavirus which is associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [2] . Shi ZL et al found that SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.5% sequence identity to SARS-related coronavirus and is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus [3] , which corresponds to that the origin may be wild animals sold in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [4] . Recent clinical research found that dyspnea might occur on the fifth day and acute respiratory distress syndrome on the eighth day from first symptom of COVID-19 in median, organ dysfunction and death can also occur in severe COVID-19 cases [5, 6] . However, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19. Finding drugs that can fight against SARS-CoV-2 is a top priority.",

However, whether it can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 or treat COVID-19 lacks clinical evidences and randomized clinical trials, and the safety of its use in COVID-19 patients is unclear. Otherwise, Lanjuan Li, infectious disease scientist, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, recommended darunavir (CAS#: 206361-99-1), also an HIV protease inhibitor, as a treatment for COVID-19. Although the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 has been verified in vitro, its therapeutic effect on COVID-19 is still unknown. At the same time, the mechanism of how these drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 is also unknown.",

As the catalytic mechanisms of CEP_C30 and PLVP are still unknown, in further studies, it should still be focused on to figure out these mechanisms and how ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir block these procedures.
