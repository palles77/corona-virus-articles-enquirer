The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now 29 recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical 30 consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common 31 origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two 32 genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population 33 dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A 34 collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences 35 of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected 36 in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results 37 demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist 38 until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the 39 main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely 40 through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated 41 in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains 42 originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to 43 Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy.",

            "text": "44 Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate 45 from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and 46 sharing. This shortcoming appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be 47 shared by many other IBV genotypes and pathogens in general. Introduction 52 Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is currently classified in the species Avian coronavirus, genus 53 Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae. The viral genome is about 27 Kb 54 long and encodes for different proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 55 numerous accessory and regulatory proteins and the Spike, Envelope, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid 56 structural proteins [1]. IBV currently represents one of the most relevant diseases of poultry 57 farming, being responsible for respiratory signs, reproductive disorders and relevant mortality, 58 particularly in presence of nephropathogenic strains or secondary infections [2]. Similarly to other 59 RNA viruses, it is characterized by high evolutionary and recombination rates, which drive the 60 rapid evolution of this pathogen and lead to a remarkable genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity [3]. 61 The Spike protein, further processed in the S1 and S2 sub-units, is by far the most studied viral 62 protein because of its relevance in viral life-cycle and host interaction. Besides being involved in 63 viral attachment and viral-host membranes fusion, it is also the main target of the host neutralizing 64 immune response [1,4]. Its remarkable variability has several implications, the most practical one 65 being the poor cross protection among different viral strains and genotypes [5], which severely 66 hinders the infection and disease control through vaccination. Additionally, the genetic variability 67 has also complicated the viral classification, leading to the proposal of a multitude of genotypes 68 based on specific research studies or local investigations, in absence of shared criteria. Although it 69 could appear a mere nomenclature issue, this state of affairs had astonishing implications impeding 70 or confusing the proper understanding of IBV molecular epidemiology. 71 Only in 2016, in the framework of COST Action FA1207, a coherent and common IBV genotype 72 classification was proposed [6], grouping the identified strains in 6 genotypes and 32 lineages.",

Moreover, doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 77 retrospective studies demonstrated its wide circulation in Italy since the early 1960s [12], where it 78 remained the most prevalent genotype for more than a decade. However, from the 1990s, its 79 detection and reporting became sporadic or absent. At the same time, in 1996, a new virus (later 80 renamed Q1) was identified in animals affected by proventriculitis [13] in China and thereafter in 81 other Asian [14,15], Middle Eastern [16,17], South American [18,19] and European countries 82 [7,20-22]. Remarkably, not recognizing the relationship between these strains, a new spreading 83 from Asia was supposed, similarly to what proven for the GI-19 lineage (QX genotype) [23]. The 84 insight provided by recent genetic studies [6,7] raised new questions about the history, 85 epidemiology and spreading of the GI-16 lineage around the world. The knowledge of these 86 processes would be of interest not only for the particular case under investigation, but could also 87 provide useful information on the general intra-and inter-continents viral dispersion patterns, aiding 88 the development and implementation of adequate control measures. 89 Unfortunately, the paucity of sequences available before Q1 detection in China prevented this 90 investigation for a long time. In the present study, a high number of retrospective GI-16 sequences 91 were generated from Italian samples collected since 1963 and analyzed together with the worldwide 92 available ones using a phylodynamic approach to reconstruct the history of this genotype and infer 93 its spreading pattern around the world. 94 95 Material and Methods 96 Italian strain detection and sequencing 97 IBV samples collected between 1963-2017 were included in the study.

Dedicated Python scripts were used to extract this 131 information from the Genbank file or, if absent, original publications were consulted and the 132 sequences were re-named accordingly.

Indeed, 135 significant deviations from the expectation can be due to several factors including low sequencing 136 quality, excessive passaging leading to the accumulation of cell-line adaptations, recombination, 137 etc. [29].

For each dataset the time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (tMRCA), 146 the evolutionary rates (substitutions/sites/year) and population dynamics (expressed as Effective 147 population size (Ne)\u2022generation time (t), also called relative genetic diversity) were jointly 148 estimated in a Bayesian fashion using the serial coalescent approach implemented in BEAST 1.8.4 149 [31]. Additionally, the discrete state phylogeographic approach implemented in the same program 150 was used to reconstruct the viral spreading pattern, assuming each collection country as a strain 151 feature [32].
