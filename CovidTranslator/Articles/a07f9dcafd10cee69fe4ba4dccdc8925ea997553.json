Increases in urbanization, the process of people living together in towns and cities rather than rural areas, result in denser populations that are subsequently more prone to spreading infectious diseases. This is particularly true in overcrowded urban centers and those that lack adequate sanitary conditions and clean water supplies. Globalization is the expansion of economies, populations, and businesses to areas throughout the world. Globalization has facilitated the ability of infectious diseases to spread rapidly between countries through trade and travel. Increased trade between countries can promote the spread of infectious diseases, particularly those found in food or animal products. Illegal activities, such as the trade of bushmeat, also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases. As an example, the U.S. Geological Survey found that bushmeat that had been confiscated at US borders contained novel herpesviruses and retroviruses. The illegal trade of bushmeat is extensive, providing an avenue for zoonoses to be transferred to the human population. In fact, the HIV pandemic may have begun with the acquisition of bushmeat contaminated with simian immunodeficiency viruses.",

A person traveling from one country to another can spread infectious diseases in this way, as occurred in the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was characterized by severe lower respiratory symptoms, pneumonia, and fever. SARS was later determined to be caused by a novel coronavirus, named SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In this case, the virus initially appeared in November of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China, and was spread by travelers within weeks to over 30 countries in Europe, North America, and other areas of China and Asia. In total, 8098 people were infected, and 774 (9.6%) died. In Guangdong Province markets, the virus was isolated from palm civets, a meat-and fruit-eating mammal with a cat-like appearance that was sold for meat. SARS-CoV was also isolated from civet meat from a restaurant that employed a worker that had contracted SARS. Although the palm civets were the most likely source of SARS-CoV in this outbreak, much higher rates of SARS-CoV were found in palm civets from local markets as compared to palm civets on distant farms. This suggested that the palm civets themselves may have contracted SARS-CoV from another animal source while in the market. The virus has also been identified in horseshoe bats, the likely natural reservoir of this zoonosis.",

It also exposes native animal populations to human diseases. An anthroponosis or anthroponotic disease is an infectious disease transferred from humans to other animals. Due to their genetic similarity to humans, great apes such as chimpanzees and gorillas are particularly susceptible to anthroponoses.

The consequences of urbanization and globalization-including but not limited to deforestation, habitat modification, and the use of wild land for farming-impact the emergence and reemergence of potential zoonoses. Increases in the human population have led to the encroachment of humans into animal habitats formerly unoccupied by humans. These circumstances contribute to humans coming in contact with animals with which they would not normally interact, putting them at risk of being exposed to zoonotic viruses that are found in the local wildlife populations. The transfer of zoonotic viruses to humans can occur directly or indirectly. For example, during an outbreak of 276 cases of Nipah virus in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998-99, most infected individuals had contact with sick pigs that were being farmed commercially as livestock and then slaughtered for meat. The pigs contracted Nipah virus from the local bats, which were thought to have spread the virus through urine or by dropping partially eaten fruit, laden with bat saliva, into the pig stalls. The bats may have acquired the fruit from the fruit trees on the farms. Human infection with Nipah virus causes encephalitis, fever, headache, and reduced consciousness. Forty percent of infected individuals died during this outbreak. Interestingly, Nipah virus infection is asymptomatic in bats.",

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the combined land and ocean surface temperature in 2014 was 1.24\u00b0F above the 20th century average, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred within the past 20 years.

Warmer daily temperatures in an area also expand the habitat for certain mosquito populations, concurrently expanding the populations that can be infected by the viruses they carry. In the United States, mosquito populations in tropical and subtropical Florida support local infections of DENV and Chikungunya virus, the latter of which first emerged in Florida in 2014. As average temperatures increase in states, so will the frequency of zoonotic viruses into states whose climate did not previously support these mosquito species.

Arboviruses are transmitted via several models of transmission ( Fig. 16.5) . The enzootic cycle, also known as the jungle cycle or sylvatic cycle (sylvatic means \"occurring in wild animals\"), occurs when the virus cycles between the arthropod vector and the natural reservoir, a wild animal. Some arboviruses may also possess an epizootic cycle, indicating the virus has the potential to cause an epidemic within animals that become infected by the vector. This can occur in wild or domestic animals, such as pigs and horses. For example, Japanese encephalitis virus normally circulates between mosquitoes and birds but can be amplified in pigs, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus has an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and rodents but is capable of initiating a rural epizootic cycle in horses. Both of these transmission cycles can result in tangential infection of humans if infected by the arthropod vector. On the other hand, an urban cycle involves the direct transmission of the virus between mosquitoes and humans. In this case, the viremia that occurs upon human infection is sufficiently large to transmit the virus when the person is bitten by the mosquito. Urban cycles occur with yellow fever virus and DENV, although both of these viruses possess enzootic transmission cycles as well. Intermediate cycles are also possible in which vectors transmit the virus back and forth between human and nonhuman hosts.",

It includes several notable human pathogens, including yellow fever virus, DENV, Japanese encephalitis virus, WNV, and St. Louis encephalitis virus (see Table 16 .2). DENV is currently the most common arboviral disease in the world, infecting around 400 million individuals and causing over 12,000 deaths each year. Dengue-like epidemics have been recorded in tropical areas of the world since the 1600s, and the virus was first isolated in 1943-44 by Albert Sabin and others from soldiers in the Pacific and Asia during World War II. DENV is considered a reemerging virus due to the expansion of the domesticated Aedes aegypti mosquito (Fig. 16.6A) , the primary vector, and Aedes albopictus, a lesser vector for DENV. The spread of these mosquito species is attributable to the factors mentioned above. Currently, the mosquito species live mainly FIGURE 16.5 Arbovirus transmission models.

Within 5-7 days of being bit by an infected mosquito, a person develops a viremia that lasts 5-12 days. DENV can be transmitted from human to human through blood transfusions or organ transplants, and perinatal transmission can occur if the mother is infected around the time of delivery. The virus can be transmitted back to a mosquito host if the insect feeds on an infected person during the viremia.

These symptoms may progress to severe dengue, which is characterized by hemorrhagic fever. This is a severe multiorgan syndrome that results from increased permeability of the vascular system, leading to petechiae and bleeding within the internal organs or from orifices like the mouth, nose, and eyes. Severe dengue usually occurs after defervescence, the abatement of fever. During this 1-2-day \"critical period,\" plasma leakage can also result in shock. The leakage of plasma from major blood vessels causes a loss of blood pressure and subsequent damage to multiple organs due to an inadequate supply of blood and the clotting of blood in small vessels. There are no antivirals approved for use against dengue virus, so treatment is supportive in an attempt to prevent progression to shock.

Additionally, in contrast to previous outbreaks in rural Central African villages, the capital cities of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia were epicenters of the 2014-15 outbreak, providing the human population to allow for rapid transmission. A plethora of other factors contributed to the spread, including mistrust of hospitals, lack of compliance, and denial of the virus.",

It is transmitted through direct contact of broken skin or mucous membranes with infectious blood or bodily fluids, including urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, or semen. It can also be transmitted through injection with contaminated syringes. Transmission events occur most often while a person is caring for an infected individual or via direct contact with the body of a deceased individual. The incubation period for EBOV is 2-21 days (average of 8-12 days), and people are not infectious until symptoms develop. Ebola virus disease (EVD) begins with the sudden onset of fever, fatigue, chills, myalgia, headache, and loss of appetite. After about 5 days, this is followed by vomiting, severe watery diarrhea, and abdominal pain. A diffuse maculopapular rash may also develop. Internal and external bleeding is not always present but may occur in some cases, noticeable as bleeding of the gums, blood within the stool, oozing from injection sites, and petechiae. In the 2014-15 outbreak, bleeding was associated with 18% of patients, most often as blood in the stool (6% of patients).",

Patients with fatal disease die of these conditions typically between day 6 and 16 after the onset of symptoms. In the 2014-15 outbreak in West Africa, the average was 7.5 days. Individuals that survive typically improve around day 6 and are thought to cease being infectious when virus is no longer detectable in the bloodstream or in urine. Interestingly, EBOV has been found in the semen of men that have recovered from EVD long after virus was undetectable in other fluids.",

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus indigenous to tropical Africa and Asia, where it is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes, usually of the genus Aedes. Chikungunya (CHIK) fever, the disease caused by CHIKV, was first recognized in epidemic form in East Africa during 1952-53. The word \"chikungunya\" is thought to derive from description in local dialect of the contorted posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with this disease. Because CHIK fever epidemics are sustained by human-mosquitohuman transmission, the epidemic cycle is similar to those of dengue and urban yellow fever. During 2005-06, 12 cases of CHIK fever were diagnosed serologically and virologically at CDC in travelers who arrived in the United States from areas known to be epidemic or endemic for CHIK fever. This report describes four of these cases.",

Most zoonoses are transmitted by wildlife or arthropod vectors. l Many human factors are involved in the emergence of infectious diseases. These include urbanization, globalization, travel advances that allow global travel, inadequate public health-care systems, and human behaviors that facilitate transmission. The susceptibility of the human host is also a factor in viral emergence.l Nearly every emerging viral disease is associated with an environmental/ecological component. The encroachment of humans into pristine environments for farming or land modification puts them in contact with new wildlife and the viruses they carry. Weather and climate, including human-induced changes, also play a role in the emergence of viruses from their natural reservoirs. l The molecular make-up of the virus determines whether or not an emerging virus will successfully infect and spread within a population. Reassortment of genetic segments, such as with influenza virus, can lead to antigenic shift and the emergence of a novel human virus. Recombination and mutation are two other means of acquiring genetic change. l RNA viruses are the most common cause of emerging diseases in humans, attributable to the high mutation rate resulting from the low fidelity of their RNA polymerases.",

            "text": "The great majority of emerging viral diseases are zoonoses transmitted by arthropods or nonhuman mammals. l Arboviruses are viruses that are transmitted to humans or other mammals by arthropods, primarily mosquitoes and ticks. The virus is acquired when the arthropod takes a blood meal that contains the virus, which then replicates within the arthropod and is transmitted within infectious saliva to a new host. l Arboviruses can be transmitted through several transmission models. The virus cycles between the arthropod vector and a wild animal in the enzootic cycle. In the rural epizootic cycle, the virus causes an epidemic within domestic animals when they are infected by the vector. An urban cycle involves the direct transmission of the virus between mosquitoes and humans. l Flaviviruses include several notable vector-transmitted human pathogens, including yellow fever virus, WNV, Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and dengue virus, the most common arboviral disease in the world. l Dengue virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, whose range has been increasing due to climate change. Three-quarters of dengue infections are asymptomatic, but dengue virus can cause dengue without warning signs, dengue with warning signs, and severe dengue, a serious condition characterized by hemorrhagic fever leading to shock and multiorgan failure. l Rodentia (rodents) and Chiroptera (bats) are the two most species-rich orders, and both are host to highimpact zoonotic viruses. Arenaviruses are transmitted by infected rodent urine and feces, and several can lead to hemorrhagic fever. l Bats are thought to be the natural reservoir of Filoviruses, enveloped helical -ssRNA viruses that are capable of causing hemorrhagic fever. Marburg virus and ebolaviruses are filoviruses. Five species of ebolaviruses have been identified, four of which infect humans and cause high mortality rates. The 2014-15 EBOV outbreak was declared over in January 2016. In total, 28,639 cases were documented, accounting for 11,316 deaths (39.5%). l EBOV is spread from person to person through direct contact of broken skin or mucous membranes with infectious blood or bodily fluids or from contaminated syringes. The incubation period averages 8-12 days, at which point a person develops symptoms and is infectious. EVD begins with the sudden onset of fever, fatigue, chills, myalgia, headache, and loss of appetite. After about 5 days, this is followed by vomiting, severe watery diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Internal and external bleeding occurs in about a fifth of patients.No antivirals or vaccine exists for EVD. Treatment is supportive in an attempt to prevent dehydration, multiorgan failure, shock, hemorrhages, and other complications. Patients with fatal disease die of these conditions typically between day 6 and 16 after the onset of symptoms. In which sorts of scenarios do you think transmission would be most likely to occur? 14. What factors contributed to the spread of EBOV in West Africa? Describe at least five.",
