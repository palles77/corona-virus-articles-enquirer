Recent studies have revealed that several nonstructural proteins encoded by the PRRSV genome independently antagonize the type 1 IFN system. The present study sought to identify the structural proteins that possess the immune evasion properties in immortalized porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM). Each structural protein gene was stably expressed in a porcine monocytederived macrophage cell line, PAM-pCD163, and tested for its potential to inhibit IFN-b induction. We then focused on the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which has a strong inhibitory effect on dsRNA-induced IFN-b production. Upon dsRNA stimulation, IFN-b production was shown to decrease proportionally with increasing levels of N expression. Furthermore, the PRRSV N protein was found to downregulate IFN-dependent gene production by dsRNA. Taken together, these results indicate the ability of N to modulate the dsRNA-mediated IFN induction pathways. In addition, the N protein significantly interfered with dsRNA-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. Our data suggest that the PRRSV N protein is a responsible component, independent of other nonstructural elements, for evading the IFN response by antagonizing IRF3 activation.",

The disease is characterized by reproductive failure in pregnant sows and mild to severe respiratory distress in piglets and growing pigs [47] . Since its emergence, the PRRS situation has become endemic in most pork-producing countries, causing tremendous economic losses in the pig industry worldwide [2, 36] . The causative agent of the disease is PRRS virus (PRRSV), which belongs to the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales [5, 31, 41] . The PRRSV genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA containing ten open reading frames (ORFs), designated ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 through 7, including ORF2b and ORF5a [12, 15, 41] . Two large ORFs, 1a and 1b, occupying the 5 0 twothirds of the genome, encode the nonstructural polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are proteolytically cleaved into 14 nonstructural protein (NSP) products: NSP1a, NSP1b, NSP2 through NSP12 including NSP7a and NSP7b, in order from the N-terminus [41, 44] . The remaining ORFs in the 3 0 -terminal region code for structural GP2, small envelope (E) , GP3, GP4, 5a, GP5, membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [12, 15, 32, 51] .",

Viral replication initially generates viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is then recognized by host-cell receptors. This interaction stimulates host signaling pathways, which leads to the coordinated activation and subsequent nuclear translocation of transcription factors, including interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB), and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), to induce the expression of type 1 IFN. Once IFN is secreted, it signals via IFN receptors on adjacent cell surfaces, which activates a cell-signaling cascade through the Janus kinase (JAK)mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. This triggers the transcription of several hundred IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), enabling target cells to produce an antiviral response to inhibit virus replication.",

PRRSV has been postulated to encode viral products that possess immune evasion properties by regulating IFN activity. Thus, several recent studies have attempted to identify NSPs with innate immune evasion features encoded by the PRRSV genome. Beura et al. [3] first reported that various NSPs, such as NSP1, NSP2, NSP4, and NSP11, are able to suppress dsRNA-induced IFN-b promoter activation. In that study, NSP1a and NSP1b, auto-cleavage products of NSP1, were shown to modulate type 1 IFN induction by antagonizing IRF3 activation. Other studies have independently demonstrated that NSP1 exerts its inhibitory effect on the IFN response in different ways by interfering with other transcription factors such as CREB-binding protein (CBP), NF-jB, and STAT-1 [6, 20] . In addition, the PRRSV NSP2 has been shown to antagonize type I IFN production by inhibiting the NF-jB signaling pathway or IRF3 activation [27, 43] . However, little is known about structural proteins that regulate IFN activity. In the present study, therefore, we aimed to identify the structural proteins of PRRSV that are responsible for mediating IFN down-regulation in immortalized natural target cells. It was showed that several structural proteins inhibit type 1 IFN induction upon dsRNA treatment. Among those viral proteins, the N protein was chosen to investigate the inhibitory mechanism and was subsequently found to block dsRNA-induced IRF3 activation. Our data indicate that the N protein has a novel function related to the immune modulation and evasion strategy during PRRSV infection.",

To date, several NSPs of PRRSV have been identified as being responsible for the poor induction of type 1 IFN by PRRSV. The present study was further expanded to the PRRSV structural proteins in order to investigate their role in the modulation of IFN in the natural target cells. To address this issue, sublines of PAM cells were first established to stably express each recombinant structural protein of PRRSV under the control of a retroviral LTR promoter. Cell clones expressing the corresponding viral proteins were initially collected and subjected to RT-PCR and western blotting to verify expression of individual viral genes at the mRNA and protein level, respectively ( Fig. 2A) . Each of the PAM cell clones constitutively expressing the highest levels of the respective structural protein was chosen for subsequent studies. In addition, a stable PAM cell line expressing the PRRSV NSP1, which alone strongly suppresses type 1 IFN induction, was generated to be used as a positive control.",

This transcription factor is ubiquitously present in the cytoplasm but, upon receiving appropriate extra stimuli, including virus infection, its C-terminus is phosphorylated by an upstream kinase. This event causes a conformational change leading to dimerization and the exposure of a nuclear-localization signal (NLS). Once IRF3 is translocated into the nucleus, it assembles on the IFN-b promoter with other transcription factors, leading to the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators such as CBP/p300, and ultimately up-regulation of IFN mRNA transcription [37] . Various viruses have evolved to disarm IRF3 activation to escape the host IFN defense. Furthermore, PRRSV NSPs are known to possess the ability to interfere with the IRF3 pathway for active IFN antagonism. Thus, essential steps of the IFR3 activation process, such as phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were studied to define the mechanism by which N inhibits type 1 IFN induction. We first determined whether IRF phosphorylation can be impaired by N. As a positive control, poly(I:C) stimulation induced the phosphorylation of IRF3 in PAM cells (Fig. 4A, lane 1) . In contrast, dsRNA-mediated IRF3 phosphorylation was undetectable in N-expressing PAM cells (lane 3).",

Although host cells produce multiple cytokines and chemokines for antiviral defense, type 1 IFNs are the principal secreted cytokines that elicit distinct antiviral effects. In turn, viruses have adopted a number of strategies to evade this key system of host immune responses. Many viruses encode components in their genome that subvert the IFN response, and these viral IFN antagonists specifically inhibit pathways involved in either IFN induction or signaling [13, 22] . PRRSV circumvents the innate immune response by suppressing type 1 IFN induction. Recent studies have revealed that this property is mediated independently by several NSPs that individually target signaling pathways to activate various transcription factors responsible for type 1 IFN production [3, 6, 20, 27, 43] . However, the structural proteins with innate immune evasion features encoded by PRRSV remain undetermined, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the IFN suppression are unknown.",

The advantages of using this continuous PAM system are that, apart from currently known PRRSV-permissive cells used in other studies, it could facilitate the unlimited supply of PAM and mimic the virus-host interactions in the natural host. GP4, GP5, and N proteins stably expressed in PAM cells are able to significantly suppress upregulation of IFN-b mRNA induced by dsRNA. To investigate the mechanism of impairment of the IFN response by the PRRSV structural protein, we focused on N, which had the strongest inhibitory effect. The N protein was also found to inhibit ISG15 induction by poly(I:C). Although all factors of the IFN system are virtually targeted by a variety of viral IFN antagonistic proteins, IRF3 is one of the ideal components of viruses at the level of the activation process for modulating the IFN response. After dsRNA stimulation in N-expressing PAM cells, our results show that N targets the IRF3 activation pathway, leading to modification of its phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation. Thus, the PRRSV N protein seems to prevent the activation of IRF3, which, in turn, blocks the full assembly of an enhanceosome complex on the IFN promoter, leading to inhibition of IFN mRNA transcription.",

            "text": "Most of the known IFN antagonistic proteins are nonstructural proteins of viruses that limit IFN production or specifically inhibit IFN signaling by infected cells by several factors of the IFN pathway [37] . There are only a few reports of viral structural proteins that function as IFN antagonists. These include the core protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the N protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [16, 21] . However, these viral structural proteins were found to inhibit the IFN response by blocking the NF-jB pathway, the other target element of the IFN system. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a structural N protein directly targeting the IRF3 activation pathway to down-regulate type 1 IFN induction. The N protein of PRRSV is a multifunctional serine phosphoprotein [41, 49] . As the sole structural component of the viral capsid, N associates with itself, providing the pivotal basis for nucleocapsid assembly and virus infectivity [23, 50] . Since the entire life cycle of PRRSV occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells, the N protein is distributed predominantly in the cytoplasmic and perinuclear regions. However, the PRRSV N protein is specifically observed in the nucleus and nucleolus of infected cells, suggesting a non-structural function(s) in these cellular compartments. Although N protein nuclear localization is dispensable for virus cytopathology and replication, it appears to play an important role in viral attenuation and pathogenesis [24] . Thus, it has been postulated that nuclear translocation of N may have effects on the nuclear function of the host cell in order to favor virus replication and modulate host antiviral responses. The present study supports this hypothesis, providing strong evidence that the N protein inhibits the host innate immune response independently of other nonstructural elements of PRRSV. It would be of further interest to evaluate whether nuclear localization of the N protein is essential for its ability to modulate the IFN response by inhibiting IRF3 activation, and this issue is currently under investigation.",

Once the PRRSV genome is released after the uncoating process in virusinfected cells, individual NSPs are initially produced, and among these, five NSPs, including NSP1a, NSP1b, NSP2, NSP4, and NSP11, independently exert their own functions Inhibition of INF-b production by PRRSV N protein 2193 in counteracting the host type 1 response by various mechanisms. Later, while the newly translated N proteins are accumulating in the cytoplasm and function as the principal structural component for nucleocapsid assembly, other N protein populations being shuttled between the cytoplasm and the nucleus appear to play non-structural roles in participating in antagonizing type 1 IFN induction. Consequently, the poor type 1 IFN production mediated by non-structural and structural elements of PRRSV causes the inadequate adaptive immune response and likely leads to viral persistence and continuous virus shedding in the natural host.",

(A) Three different stable PAM cell lines with low-, moderate-, or high-level N expression were stimulated with poly(I:C) for 6 h and used for real-time RT-PCR for the determination of IFN-b mRNA copy number as described earlier. The bottom panels indicate increasing levels of N expression in each stable cell line, and b-actin was used as a protein loading control. (B) Total RNA was isolated from poly(I:C)-treated PAM cells in the presence or absence of N and analyzed for the quantitative detection of ISG15 mRNA by real-time RT-PCR. The level of ISG15 mRNA in the absence of N upon poly(I:C) stimulation was set at 100%, and that of the N protein was normalized accordingly. These values are representative of the average of three independent experiments, and error bars As expected, poly(I:C) treatment was able to cause translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus (Fig. 4B, top panel, lane 5). However, in the presence of N, the level of IRF3 in the nucleus was markedly reduced to the basal level (lane 7). This observation was further confirmed by visualization of subcellular localization of IRF3. As shown in Fig. 5, IRF3 is normally located in the cytoplasm with nuclear diffusion in PAM cell lines without dsRNA stimulation (top, second, Inhibition of dsRNA-mediated IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation by N. (A) Phosphorylation of IRF3 in N-geneexpressing cells. PAM cells in the presence or absence of N were induced by poly(I:C).

(B) Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation of PAM cells expressing N. Eachnuclear and cytosolic fraction was prepared from PAM cells under the indicated conditions and subjected to western blot analysis with an antibody specific for IRF3 (top panel), SP1 as a nuclear protein marker (second panel), a-tubulin as a cytosolic protein marker (third panel), or the PRRSV N protein (fourth panel).

The cells were then counterstained with DAPI (third panels) and examined using a fluorescent microscope at 4009 magnification.
