Therefore, the development of simple preparation method for the derivatives such as glycyrrhetic acid polyglycosides (2) has been strongly urged. Although the powerful polymerization methods to give (1 ? 3)-, (1 ? 4)-, and (1 ? 6)-linked polysaccharides have been constructed to date, 9 that for (1 ? 2)-linked polysaccharides has not been sufficiently developed yet. 10 On the other hand, it is known that glycal epoxide 3 is a potentially useful glycosyl donor for the synthesis of (1 ? 2)-linked oligosaccharidecontaining glycosides (Fig. 2) . Danishefsky et al. demonstrated the simple stepwise glycosidation via ring-opening nucleophilic addition of alcohol to the epoxide 3. 11 Several processes concerning protection-deprotection can be shortened using 3 because the nucleophilic addition to 3 accompanies with the generation of a free secondary alcohol. However, the applications of 3 to graft polymerization techniques were difficult due to the high unstability of 3.",

The cationic ring-opening condensation polymerization of 4 was performed in the presence of glycyrrhetic acid (5) as an initiator and trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (TfOH) as a catalyst. 14 This method enables not only the one-pot synthesis of 2 but also the control of polymerization degree of (1 ? 2)-linked oligosaccharide skeleton. The analyses of chemical stability of 3 and 4 were also investigated. on the sulfur atom, 12, 16 which was used for the next studies without separation. While 4 was sufficiently stable for purification on a florisil column chromatography, epoxide 3 decomposed easily under the same purification condition. To evaluate the difference of chemical stability between 3 and 4, each solution of 3 and 4 in CDCl 3 was kept at arbitrary temperatures (20, 40, and 60\u00b0C) and analyzed by 1 H NMR measurements. 17, 18 Assuming that the degradation reactions obey first-order kinetics, the rate constants were determined from the time vs. ln([3 or 4]/[3 or 4] 0 ) plots using the integral ratios from the 1 H NMR spectra. As a result, it was found that 4 survived for longer time than 3 at all temperatures.",

Initiator 5 was prepared from commercially available glycyrrhetic acid via benzyl protection of carboxylic acid. The grafting polymerization of 4 from 5 were performed in CH 2 Cl 2 in the presence of TfOH and molecular sieves 3\u00c5 (MS 3A) at room temperature. The results are summarized in Table 2 . The conversion of 4, the polymerization degree, and the number average molecular weight (M n ) were determined by the 1 H NMR analyses of crude mixture. The conversion of 5 and the polydispersity index (M w /M n ) were estimated by a size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using THF on the basis of polystyrene standards. At first, we used the stoichiometric amount of both 5 and TfOH to that of 4. Contrary to our expectation that the reaction would mainly give the monosaccharide-containing glycoside, the conversion of 5 was middle (45.8%) and that of 4 was quantitative (entry 1, Table 1 ). The average polymerization degree was 2.9, indicating that M n of Poly-6 is 1,800 Da. The M w /M n of Poly-6 was a relatively narrow value (1.1). Such results indicate that the bulky alcohol of 5 as a neopentyl alcohol would slowly initiate the glycosylation reaction of 4 along with the elimination of SO 2 to generate a free alcohol at the 2 position of the sugar. The resultant secondary alcohol could exhibit a higher reactivity than the neopentyl alcohol of 5, which would facilitate further nucleophilic addition to the other cyclic sulfite 4, leading to the ring-opening polycondensation of 4 initiated by 5. It is noted that the polymer with a narrow M w /M n was obtained, even when the excess amount of 5 was used (entry 2).",

With the decrease in the feed ratio of 5 against 4, the conversion of 4 decreased whereas that of 5 increased (entries 3-5), which afforded the similar M n values. The decreased amount of TfOH prolonged the reaction time, probably because the reaction rate would be strongly dependent on the concentration of acid. On the other hand, when the amount of MS 3A was decreased to 25 wt % (entry 6), the conversion of 4 was dramatically improved, resulting in the formation of the polymer with higher M n . In the cases of entries 7 and 8 with 5 mol % of TfOH, the reduced amount of MS 3A (12.5 wt %) also enabled the high conversion of 4 to give the higher-molecular-weight polymer. Such results suggest that M n of Poly-6 was moderately controllable by the change of feed ratio. The use of MS 3A as a dehydrator might reduce the effective concentration of acid. The crude material after a typical workup was precipitated into MeOH to remove the remaining 4 and 5. 17 The structure of the polymer as a MeOH-insoluble part was evaluated by IR, 1 H NMR, and MALDI-TOF mass spectra. In the IR spectrum, the absence of the characteristic signal of sulfite at around 1200 cm \u00c01 was observed, 17 suggesting that the polymerization of 4 efficiently eliminates SO 2 to form (1 ? 2)-linked oligosaccharide skeletons. The presence of enone absorption band at around 1660 cm \u00c01 was also confirmed. In the 1 H NMR spectrum (Fig. S13) , the signals attributed to glycyrrhetic acid and oligosaccharides appeared along with the disappearance of the protons of 4, 17 supporting the efficient conversion of 4. The chemical shift of olefinic proton signal of the polymer almost agreed with that of 5, also supporting the retention of the enone moiety after the polymerization. It has been reported that the Ag-or Hg-catalyzed glycosylation to glycyrrhetic acid skeleton gave the corresponding enol glycoside, 8b highlighting the present reaction condition is a useful method to suppress the side reaction. The polymerization degree of the grafted oligosaccharide was determined on the basis of the integral ratio between the olefinic proton and the aliphatic protons at 3.0-4.2 ppm assignable to the sugar protons except for the anomeric protons. The M n values of Poly-6 were calculated as the total mass of the initiator moiety and the oligosaccharide moiety bearing the obtained polymerization degree.",

The additional minor peaks attributed to the polymers initiated by a trace of H 2 O were barely detectable in the spectrum, indicating the important role of MS 3A as a dehydrator.",

The method enables the rapid preparation of glycyrrhizin derivatives consisting oligosaccharides with arbitrary polymerization degree. Because other natural glycosides bearing (1 ? 2)-linked oligosaccharides such as cyaniding-3-Osophoroside 19 and quercetin-3-O-sophoroside 20 have been reported, this method would be also applicable to the preparations of their derivatives. The present results may provide new insights into not only natural product syntheses but also the creation of high performance polymers based on a grafting reaction. Further investigations on the control of stereochemistry on the anomeric centers and the evaluation of structure-activity relationship are currently in progress. ",
