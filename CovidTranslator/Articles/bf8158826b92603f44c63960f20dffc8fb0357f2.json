IL-8, the main chemokine and activator of neutrophils, might be related to the lung injury upon PRRSV infection. In this study, we showed that PRRSV induced IL-8 expression in vivo and in vitro. Subsequently, we demonstrated that JNK and NF-\u03baB pathways were activated upon PRRSV infection and required for the enhancement of IL-8 expression. We further verified that PRRSV-activated TAK-1 was essential for the activation of JNK and NF-\u03baB pathways and IL-8 expression. Moreover, we revealed an AP-1 binding motif in the cloned porcine IL-8 (pIL-8) promoter, and deletion of this motif abolished the pIL-8 promoter activity. Finally, we found that the JNK-activated AP-1 subunit c-Jun was critical for the up-regulation of IL-8 expression by PRRSV. These data suggest that PRRSVinduced IL-8 production is likely through the TAK-1/JNK/AP-1 pathways.",

PRRS virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped positive single stranded RNA virus and belongs to the genus Arterivirus, family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997) . PRRSV genome is approximately 15.4 kb in length and has 10 open reading frames (ORFs) (Yun and Lee, 2013) . PRRSV exhibits a highly restricted host cell tropism for the cells of the monocyte/macrophage/dendritic lineages (Duan et al., 1997) . Since 2006, there have been devastating outbreaks of atypical PRRS in China, which is characterized by high fever, high morbidity, and high mortality. A highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) isolate with a 30-amino-acid (30 aa) deletion in nonstructural protein (nsp2) was identified as the causative agent (Tian et al., 2007) .",

The mechanistic basis for the acute phase of respiratory distress is likely a consequence of the release of inflammatory cytokines in the lung (Chand et al., 2012) . The intensity of the disease appears to vary among isolates and variation in the pathogenicity of PRRSV has been observed in experimentally infected animals (Cho and Dee, 2006; Han et al., 2014) . HP-PRRSV is reported to cause severe acute lung injury (Han et al., 2014) . The lesions include destruction of lung structure with extensive hemorrhage and a large number of inflammatory cell infiltration into the alveolar spaces. Additionally, interstitial pneumonia also occurs, which is characterized by a marked thickening of the alveolar septa (Shang et al., 2013) . Upon infection, neutrophils are always the first to be recruited to the focus and cause capillary leak and pulmonary edema (Segel et al., 2011) . Compared with the pigs infected typical PRRSV strains, the number of neutrophils in the lungs of HP-PRRSV-infected pigs was significantly increased Han et al., 2014) . IL-8 is the main chemokine and activator of neutrophils (Pease and Sabroe, 2002) . Upon receiving inflammatory stimuli, IL-8 can be up-regulated in many different cell types, including fibroblasts, monocytes, and hepatocytes (Mukaida, 2000) . Thus, we assume that IL-8 production might be induced and be related in the lung lesion upon PRRSV infection (Bohnet et al., 1997; Fujimori et al., 2003; Harada, 1994; Hay and Sarau, 2001; Jundi and Greene, 2015; .",

CH-1a also induced IL-8 expression, but at a lower level. These data suggest that PRRSV-induced IL-8 production is not strain-dependent, but varies among stains. To confirm this result, we infected PAMs with HV and CH-1a at an MOI of 0.02, 0.1 or 1. Our results indicated that the upregulation of IL-8 by both HV and CH-1a was in a dose dependent manner ( Fig. 1B and C) . We also detected the cell viability after PRRSV infection, and found that infection with an MOI of 1 for 24 h or an MOI of 0.1 for 36 h led to significant PAM death (data not shown). Thus, we used MOI of 0.1 to infect PAMs in the following experiment. Additionally, the IL-8 protein level induced by PRRSV was significantly increased (Fig. 1D) .",

Twenty-four hours later, the expression of IL-8 mRNA was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2A , inhibitors of JNK (SP60125), p38 (SB203580), and NF-\u03baB (BAY11-7082) significantly inhibited IL-8 production induced by HV by 70%, 50%, and 90%, respectively. While inhibition of MEK (PD98059), PKC (GF109203X) or PI3K (LY294002) only slightly decreased IL-8 mRNA expression. These findings suggest that the JNK and NF-\u03baB pathways might be involved in PRRSV-induced IL-8 production. To confirm this, PAMs were treated with JNK inhibitor and NF-\u03baB inhibitor at different concentrations before PRRSV infection. As shown in Fig. 2B , the inhibitory effects of both inhibitors were in a dose dependent manner. In addition, they also impaired IL-8 protein secretion (Fig. 2C) . We also analyzed PRRSV replication in the presence of JNK and NF-\u03baB inhibitors. Our results showed that JNK and NF-\u03baB inhibitors at the used concentrations did not affect PRRSV replication (Fig. 2D ). To further investigate whether JNK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways are activated in PRRSV-infected PAMs, JNK and I\u03baB phosphorylations were analyzed by western blot. As shown in Fig. 2E and F, the phosphorylated JNK and I\u03baB were significantly increased at 12 h and 24 h post infection. Meanwhile, I\u03baB was gradually degraded in PRRSV- infected cells. Together, these results suggest that PRRSV infection induces IL-8 production by activating the JNK and NF-\u03baB pathways.",

Using the bioinformatics approach (http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html), several putative transcriptional regulatory elements were found in the 5\u2032flanking region of the pIL-8 gene, including CREB, C/EBP \u03b2, AP-1, OCT-1, and NF-\u03baB. To evaluate the porcine IL-8 promoter activity and determine the region responsive to PRRSV infection, serial deletions starting from the 5\u2032-end of the promoter were generated and schematically shown in Fig. 4A . Luciferase reporter vectors were constructed, and then transfected into Marc-145 cells. The luciferase activities were assessed with or without PRRSV infection. Our results showed that deletion construct \u2212187/123-luc exhibited a 66% upregulation after PRRSV infection, while other constructs were not upregulated by virus infection (Fig. 4B ). When the promoter was truncated to \u2212108/123 and \u221276/123, the basal-level luciferase activity was low and there were no significant changes for the luciferase activity after PRRSV infection. This observation suggests that the regulatory elements might exist in the region from \u2212187 to \u221276 bp in porcine IL-8 promoter and the responsive elements could be the putative AP-1 (\u2212138 to \u2212130)\uff0cC/EBP \u03b2 (\u2212107 to \u221290) and/or NF-\u03baB (\u221292 to \u221282). We then deleted each of AP-1, NF-\u03baB and C/EBP \u03b2, two or all three of the binding sites from \u2212108/123-luc to generate new mutation vectors (Fig. 4C) . Luciferase results showed that mutations with AP-1 binding site deletion significantly impaired IL-8 promoter activation (Fig. 4D ), suggesting that AP-1 biding site in porcine IL-8 promoter is the main responsive element for PRRSV infection.",

Subsequently, we demonstrated that PRRSV-induced IL-8 production was mainly dependent on the activation of TAK-1/JNK/AP-1 pathways. It was demonstrated that infection with a highly pathogenic strain of PRRSV elicited a significant elevation of cytokines including IL-8 in BALF, serum and TBLN homogenates of pigs . In our study, we found that PRRSV infection induced IL-8 expression both in vivo and in vitro. Besides, PAMs infected with HP-PRRSV isolate induced higher level of IL-8 expression in PAMs than CH-1a, which is in accordance with another in vivo report (Han et al., 2014) . The extensive level of IL-8 and the neutrophils recruited to lungs should be of particular significance in the lung injury. After stimulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines, the activated neutrophils could release free radicals, inflammatory cytokines and proteases, which have contributions to lung lesions (Avasarala et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014; Ware and Matthay, 2000) . Indeed, compared with traditional strain, HP-PRRSV isolate can cause much severer neutrophil infiltration and lung lesions (Han et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2007) . Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that upon HP-PRRSV infection macrophages secret higher levels of IL-8, which recruits more neutrophils and eventually leads to tissue damage and dysfunction of the lung.",

            "text": "Previous studies have indicated that maximal IL-8 protein expression requires NF-\u03baB activation as well as the activation of the MAP kinases ERK, JNK, and p38 (Li et al., 2002) . In our study, NF-\u03baB inhibitor can reduce the up-regulated IL-8 production by PRRSV infection, indicating that PRRSV-induced IL-8 expression is partially dependent on NF-\u03baB pathway. This is in agreement with the report regarding the significance of NF-\u03baB pathway in IL-8 expression induced by other stimulators (Ohkuni et al., 2011) . Moreover, our results suggest that JNK pathway is more essential for PRRSV induced IL-8 expression as JNK and c-Jun inhibitor and siRNA knockdown of c-Jun and c-Fos significantly reduced IL-8 expression. Similarly, under stimulation of HIV-1, HCV and Papillomavirus, the expression of IL-8 is also JNK dependent (Chen et al., 2015; Gangwani and Kumar, 2015; Saeed et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014) . JNK isoforms are strongly activated in response to various cellular stresses (Cargnello and Roux, 2011) . And indeed, we found that PRRSV infection activated JNK, which is in agreement with other reports (Huo et al., 2013; Jing et al., 2014; Lee and Lee, 2012; Yin et al., 2012) . Here, we need to indicate that even though JNK inhibitor SP and NF-\u03baB inhibitor BAY significantly inhibit IL-8 mRNA expression induced by PRRSV infection, they do not affect the protein level of IL-8 at the same level, suggesting that there may exist post transcription level regulations such as translation repress, which might be not affected by JNK and NF-kB inhibitors. Interestingly, it has been reported that ARE in IL-8 3\u2032 UTR can recruit TTP, which can repress RNA translation (Anderson and Kedersha, 2009; Eulalio et al., 2007; Franks and Lykke-Andersen, 2008; Winzen Y. Liu et al. Virology 506 (2017 ) 64-72 et al., 2007 . However, this needs to be investigated in the future. The transcription factor c-Jun is a well-described substrate for JNKs. The phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK has been reported to potentiate the transcriptional capacity of c-Jun, thus enhancing its ability to engage in gene transcription as well as its own expression (Hazzalin and Mahadevan, 2002) . Our results also show significant phosphorylation and expression of c-Jun upon PRRSV infection, which is dependent on JNK activation. It is reported that stabilization of IL-8 mRNA is modulated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (Hoffmann, 2002; Winzen et al., 2007) . Exposure to the inflammatory cytokine IL-1 has been shown to stabilize IL-8 mRNA through p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and MK2 (Winzen et al., 2007) . Interestingly, we found that p38 inhibitor also reduced IL-8 mRNA expression.",

Analysis demonstrates that the promoter elements contain NF-\u03baB, AP-1, and C/EBP \u03b2 binding sites (Matsusaka et al., 1993; Mukaida and Murayama, 1998; Nourbakhsh et al., 2001) . The promoter is regulated in a cell type-specific fashion, requiring a NF-\u03baB element plus either an AP-1 or a C/EBP \u03b2 element (Chang et al., 2004; Wu et al., 1997) . We cloned the 2751 bp-sequence in the 5\u2032 flanking region of the porcine IL-8 gene. Truncation mutations indicated that the region from \u2212187 to +123 bp was essential for the porcine IL-8 promoter activity. However, the longer promoter was not stimulated by PRRSV. The reason could be that there might exist some negative regulation elements in the upstream of the \u2212187 to +123 bp. Analysis showed that AP-1, C/EBP \u03b2, and NF-\u03baB elements existed in the region from \u2212187 to \u221276 bp. Deletion of these three elements suggested that AP-1 element was the most significant one in PRRSV induced IL-8 expression. Similar result was reported with SARS-CoV (Chang et al., 2004) .",

TAK1 regulates JNK, p38 MAPKs and I\u03baB kinase (IKK) signaling pathways, leading to the activation of transcription factors AP-1 and NF-\u03baB (Sakurai, 2002) . Consistent with this, we found that PRRSV significantly induced TAK-1 activation and PRRSV-induced IL-8 expression was TAK-1 dependent.
