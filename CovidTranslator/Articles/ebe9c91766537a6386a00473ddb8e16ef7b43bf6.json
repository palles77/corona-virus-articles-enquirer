            "text": "Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV-3) is, along with human respiratory syncytial virus, a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections (RTI) in infants and young children, as well as in immunocompromised patients, particularly hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. In this patient population, a high incidence of hPIV-3 infection with prolonged virus shedding, and a high mortality rate have been reported. [1] [2] [3] [4] Although steroid treatment for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) has been shown to be associated with progression to hPIV-3 pneumonia, the only identified risk factor for hPIV-3 infection after HSCT was the use of an unrelated volunteer as stem cell donor. 4 In addition, mortality rates increased when hPIV-3 infection occurred within 100 days after HSCT. 2, 3 In recent years, several outbreaks of hPIV-3 infection among adult HSCT recipients have been described, [5] [6] [7] [8] with mortality rates reported to be either high 8 or low. 7 In these reports, the adoption of adequate and timely preventive isolation measures was often ineffective in controlling virus transmission, due to virus presence in asymptomatic staff members or external visitors, or even on room surfaces. 6 Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of hPIV-3 strains directly in clinical specimens allowed the verification of whether a single strain or multiple hPIV-3 strains were responsible for the current outbreak. While in some outbreaks a single strain was found to circulate, 8 in other outbreaks different hPIV-3 strains were circulating, thus originating different clusters within the same outbreak. 5, 6 In the present report, we describe an hPIV-3 infection nosocomial outbreak occurring in both the outpatient and inpatient Oncohematology sections of the Department of Pediatrics, showing that through several weeks an apparently single episode was actually supported by different hPIV-3 strains originating four clusters of infection of different magnitude, whereas strains detected post-outbreak gave origin to a totally independent cluster.",

Following discharge from the hospital, patients from the OHU are followedup twice weekly for at least 100 days after HSCT and whenever clinically indicated. In addition, patients under chemotherapy have access to the hospital every time they must receive cytotoxic drugs or transfusions. The site of these periodical controls is the Outpatient Section (OPS) of the OHU. From the waiting room, patients are taken to separate visiting rooms, following potential air-borne contacts with parents of the other patients in the waiting room. It also has to be emphasized that protective measures such as hand washing, masks, and gloves may be not sufficient to prevent virus transmission. Since most patients are infants and young children, contacts with parents and accompanying persons from the community were frequent.",

In 16/32 patients (50.0%), mild symptoms related to upper respiratory tract infection were observed (rhinitis, cough, and sore throat), whereas in 16 patients symptoms or syndromes related to lower respiratory tract infection were observed (bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia). The only patient with a hPIV-3 load <1.0\u00d710 5 RNA copies/mL was an HSCT recipient (from a matched unrelated donor) with bilateral pneumonia and hPIV-3 respiratory infection ongoing from an undefined number of days (pt # 28; see below). Thus, a level of 1.0\u00d710 5 RNA copies/mL NPA was selected as a cut-off for diagnosis of acute hPIV-3 infection in respiratory secretions. The percentage of hPIV-3 shedding patients over time in the two groups of immunocompromised and immunocompetent pediatric patients is reported in Figure 2 . The median duration of viral shedding was 72 days for immunocompromised patients, and 18 days for immunocompetent patients, with a highly significant difference (log-rank test, p<0.0001).

It must be noted that this child also had a disseminated infection from BCG vaccination. Notwithstanding the persisting (after 30 days) hPIV-3 infection with high viral load (in association with a low viral load human coronavirus NL63 infection) an unrelated cord blood transplantation was performed, due to severe progressively deteriorating clinical conditions of the patient, but after two weeks the patient deceased due to repeated episodes of pulmonary hemorrhage ( Figure 3 ).",

The chronological analysis of the outbreak with respect to sporadic cases of hPIV-3 infection observed in the post-outbreak period suggested that a single strain could have been responsible for the outbreak. However, the phylogenetic analysis of the outbreak and post-outbreak strains revealed that multiple hPIV-3 strains were responsible for the outbreak. In detail, a single hPIV-3 strain contributed to cluster #1 including 16 patients (15 immunocompromised, and one immunocompetent patient), while another strain formed cluster #2 consisting of 6 patients (5 immunocompromised, and one immunocompetent), and two additional strains formed the two small clusters #3 and #4, including 3 patients each. One of the 3 patients of cluster #4 differed by a single nucleotide (patient #31) from the other 2 patients. Besides the four strains forming the four clusters, four single strains were found during the outbreak (patients #12, 21, 22, and 27), which presumably were introduced into the wards or the OPS from the community (2 HSCT recipients, and 2 immunocompetent patients) in the absence of nosocomial transmission. These findings allow the hypothesis that both routes of transmission (community-acquired and nosocomial) may have contributed to the outbreak. In the past, several outbreaks of hPIV-3 infection among adult HSCT recipients have been reported, notwithstanding the preventive isolation measures taken to limit virus transmission within the interested units. Phylogenetic analysis has been of great utility in tracing virus transmission within clinical wards. The first report appeared in 1993 and showed (based on sequencing of a fragment of the F gene) that within a pediatric intermediate care unit 6 children were infected by genetically very similar hPIV-3 strains different from community isolates. 15 In 1998, in an adult HSCT unit, it was shown (again by sequencing a fragment of the F gene) that multiple genetically distinct hPIV-3 strains were introduced from the community into the unit, with subsequent nosocomial transmission of a single strain. 16 In addition, the same report emphasized the sustained shedding of the same hPIV-3 strain by transplanted patients for up to four months. These findings fit with the results of the present study dealing with pediatric HSCT recipients and oncohematologic patients and show that: (i) multiple genetically distinct hPIV-3 strains were introduced from the community into the unit during the outbreak; (ii) while a single strain caused the major outbreak lasting more than three months, three other distinct strains caused minor levels of transmission, and some additional strains detected during the outbreak did not give any sign of nosocomial transmission; (iii) shedding over time of hPIV-3 strains by young hematologic patients was significantly longer than that of immunocompetent children.",

It must be noted that often during the molecular analysis of hPIV-3 outbreaks, differences in a small number of nt (1-3) within the sequence analyzed of a given gene, have been considered to represent a virus strain very similar to the major strain responsible for the outbreak, and, thus, have been grouped together with the major virus strain not displaying nt changes among several patients. 5, 6 However, as previously reported by other 8 and confirmed in our study, hPIV-3 strains do not undergo any nt change even over an extended period of time (at least five months).",

However, in most cases, it appears difficult to attribute the cause of death to hPIV infection, since virus in lungs or BAL secretions is often not detected, and, thus, only an association of hPIV-3 infection and death can be documented. In our study, only one out of the 32 patients (3.1%) with hPIV-3 infection died. We cannot exclude that the original disease (Omenn syndrome) causing profound defects in both arms (cellular and humoral) of the immune response, as well as the disseminated BCG infection, contributed to the death of this patient, although the lack of necroscopy findings did not permit more information to be gained about the role of hPIV-3 infection in the final outcome of this patient.",
