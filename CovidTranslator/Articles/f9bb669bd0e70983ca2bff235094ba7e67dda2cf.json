HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL6 belong to a-coronavirus, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43 are b-coronaviruses, and they both infect only mammals. g-Coronavirus and d-coronavirus infect birds, but some of them can also infect mammals [27] . Based on current sequence databases, it has been discovered that all human CoVs have animal origins; SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E are considered to have originated in bats; HCoV-OC43 and HKU1N are likely originated from rodents [28, 29] .",

The genomic RNA, which acts as a messenger RNA (mRNA), plays an important role in the initial RNA synthesis of the infectious cycle, template for replication and transcription and as a substrate for packaging into the progeny virus. In all CoVs, 5' two-thirds of the genome encodes a replicase polyproteins, pp1ab, which comprises of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b. These ORFs are then processed by viral proteases to cleave into 16 non-structural proteins that are involved in genome transcription and replication. The 3' terminus encodes CoV canonical set of four structural proteins; including (i) the nucleocapsid (N) protein, a basic RNA-binding protein, (ii) a spike protein (S), a type of glycoprotein I, (ii) a membrane protein (M) that spans the membrane, and (iii) an envelope protein (E), a highly hydrophobic protein that covers the entire structure of the coronavirus [31] (Fig. 2) . These accessory proteins are not only important for virion assembly but may also have an additional link that they suppress the host immune response to facilitate viral replication.",

On the other hand, the patients who received ribavirin (1), lopinavir (10, see Fig. 4 )-ritonavir (2) and a corticosteroid had lower 21-day acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death rates than those who received ribavirin and a corticosteroid [54, 55] combination therapy using interferon a-1 and corticosteroid was associated with improved oxygen saturation and more rapid resolution of radiographic lung opacities than systemic corticosteroid alone (uncontrolled study) [56] . The use of the corticosteroid, methylprednisolone (3, Fig. 3 ) as a therapeutic intervention for SARS patients was associated with an increased 30-day mortality rate (adjusted OR = 26.0, 95% CI = 4.4-154.8). However, disseminated fungal infection and avascular osteonecrosis occurred following the prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy [57] [58] [59] . A randomized, placebocontrolled study showed that plasma SARS-CoV RNA levels in weeks 2-3 of the illness were higher in patients given hydrocortisone (n = 10) than those given normal saline (n = 7) in the early phase of the illness, suggesting that early use of pulsed methylprednisolone (3) might prolong viremia. In the case of patients with MERS, the combination of ritonavir (2) + interferon a2a or interferon a-2b resulted in no significant effect on clinical outcome; case-control study showed significantly improved survival (14 out of 20 and 7 out of 24 in the treated and control groups, respectively; P = 0.004) at 14 days, but not at 28 days [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] .",

Shen et al reported broad-spectrum inhibitors of human coronaviruses, see Table 2 [64]. They identified seven compounds (lycorine, emetine, monensin sodium, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, phenazopyridine, and pyrvinium pamoate) from HTS screening as broad-spectrum inhibitors according to their strong inhibition of replication by four CoVs in vitro at low-micromolar concentrations. These seven broad-spectrum inhibitors suppressed the replication of all CoVs in a dose-dependent manner and with low EC 50 values. Although the cytotoxic concentration for some compound is as high as of their inhibitions, phenazopyridine, pyrvinium pamoate, and monensin sodium displayed less CC 50 values.

They all were able to inhibit the replication of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV as well as HCoV-229E in the low micromolar range, which suggest that they could be used for the broad spectral anti-viral activity. As a mode of action, 7 inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV in a dose-dependent manner with an EC 50 of 3.0 mM and the inhibition contributed to the blockade of the virus at a very early stage. Compound 7 was previously reported as an effective anti-viral agent against flavivirus, influenza virus, HIV [66] , Ebola virus [67] , and Nipha-Hendra virus [68] . Chlorpromazine (8) was another hit compound resulted from the screening and inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV with an EC 50 of 4.9 mM. Chlorpromazine (8) is the first antipsychotic drug developed for the treatment of schizophrenia [69] and mechanistically it inhibited the clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It has also been reported to inhibit the replication of hepatic C virus [70] (HCV), alphavirus [71] , mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-2) [72] and other coronavirus SARS-CoV [73] . The mechanistic study of chlorpromazine (8) on MERS-CoV indicated that it inhibited the virus at both an early and postentry stage, suggesting that an effect on clathrin-mediated endocytosis was not only the sole antiviral mechanism. Loperamide (9), an antidiarrheal opioid receptor agonist, which reduces intestinal motility [74] , inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV. Additionally, it inhibited the other two coronaviruses in the low micromolar range (4 to 6 mM).",

Antidiarrheal agent loperamide (9), or anti-HIV-1 agent lopinavir (10) were able to inhibit both MERSand SARS-CoVs infection in the low-micromolar range and was linear with the study by de Wilde et al. [79] . Antiparasitics, mefloquine (20) , and amodiaquine dihydrochloride (21) or antibacterial, emetine dihydrochloride hydrate (19) in which that function was not linked to coronaviruses in general, showed antiviral activity against both CoVs. Cathepsins are important for the fusion step during virus entry of coronavirus [80] . Cathepsin inhibitor, E-64-D (22) , blocked the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV at the entry stage. The neurotransmitter inhibitor triflupromazine (33) inhibited both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In addition to that, other neurotransmitters fluphenazine (29) and promethazine (30) were reported to inhibit MERS-CoVs protein-mediated cell-cell fusion with IC 50 values of about 20 and 29 mM, respectively [81] . Kinase signaling pathway inhibitors imatinib mesylate (35) and dasatinib (36) are known inhibitors of the Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog-1 pathway (ABL-1) and were active against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The data suggest that the ABL-1 pathway may be important for the viral replication and inhibitors of this pathway may have the potential in the discovery of antiviral agents. The identified DNA synthesis inhibitors (for example, gemcitabine hydrochloride, 23) those were active against at least one coronavirus, suggest that these drugs have potential as antiviral therapy against coronaviruses.

Recently, mycophenolic acid was identified as a potential anti-MERS-CoV drug by a high-throughput screening approach and has a potent anti-MERS-CoV activity in vitro [83] . However, a subsequent study in a non-human primate model did not provide a positive result as the treatment of MERS-CoV infected common marmosets with mycophenolic acid had a worse outcome than untreated animals did [84] . Proteases are indispensable for the viral life cycle and they play an essential role in viral replication by mediating the maturation of viral replicases. Therefore, targeting proteases has become an attractive approach for developing potential antiviral drugs. Protease inhibitors block the replication of coronaviruses (CoVs), including the causative agents of MERS and SARS infection. The papain-like protease (PL pro ) and a 3C-like protease (3CL pro also known as the main protease) are important two proteases that mediate the process replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b. PL pro is a cysteine protease that uses the thiol group of cysteine as a nucleophile to attack the carbonyl group of the scissile peptide bond for cleavage at first three positions of its polyprotein to produce three nonstructural proteins, while 3CL pro cleaves the remaining 11 locations, releasing non-structural proteins from nsp4 to nsp16. As a result, sequence motifs recognized by MERS-CoV PL pro and SARS-CoV PL pro are (L/I)XGG#(A/D)X and LXGG#(A/K)X, respectively (Fig. 6) .",

Silvestrol was recently shown to have potent antiviral activity in Ebola virus-infected human macrophages. They found that silvestrol is also a potent and non-toxic inhibitor of cap-dependent viral mRNA translation in CoV-infected human embryonic lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells. It was found to be highly effective against both infections with EC 50 values of 1.3 nM and 3 nM, respectively. For MERS-CoV, the potent antiviral activities of silvestrol were also confirmed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a second type of human primary cells. Mechanistically Silvestrol strongly inhibited the expression of CoV structural and nonstructural proteins (N, nsp8) and the formation of viral replication/ transcription complexes.

This was supported by the recent X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV PL pro complex with the lead inhibitors 50 and 51. These structures revealed that inhibitors did not bind to the catalytic site of SARS CoV PL pro but to the BL2 loop, which appears to prevent the accessibility of substrate to the active site, and thereby inhibiting the enzymatic activity. Structural and sequence analysis at BL2 loop of SARS-CoV PLproand MERS CoV PL pro suggested that they both have a difference in key amino acid residues that are responsible for inhibitor binding. For example, Y269 and Q270 are responsible for inhibitor binding in SARS-CoV PL pro , whereas T274 and A275 in MERS CoV PL pro . These findings suggest that making dual inhibitors targeting PL pro of SARS-and MERS-CoVs is difficult.",

Benzotriazole derivatives (64,65) that have an activated carbonyl functionality displayed inhibition against both SARS-CoV 3CL pro and MERS-CoV 3CL pro [111] .",

For this reason, a nonprime site substituent and warheads combined with the decahydroisonoline was designed and evaluated against SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The resulting analogs have Ac-Thr-Gly-OH (compound 81, Fig. 11 ), instead of an original Ac-Thr-Val sequence in 75, since an isopropyl side chain of the Val in 75 is directed to an outward of SARS 3CL pro and no interactions with SARS 3CL pro at the Val site is detected. Indeed the compound showed about 2.4 times potent inhibitory activities for SARS 3CL pro when combined with a non-prime site substituent. This finding indicated not only the expected additional interactions with the SARS 3CL pro but also the possibility of new inhibitors containing a fused-ring system as a hydrophobic scaffold and a new warhead such as thioacetal. It was reported that mature SARS 3CL protease is subject to degradation at the188Arg/189Gln site [120] . Therefore, R188I mutant protease with high activity and stability was prepared. Kenichi et al were involved in developing inhibitors SARS 3CL R188I mutant protease. As a result, the compound 75 was developed with an IC 50 value of 98 nM [118] . However, due to problems like enzymatic digestions of peptide chains and a-proton racemization, these compounds are not further taken forward. To solve this problem, they designed another derivative Sk23 (82, Fig. 11 ) [121] with serine backbone against the mutant protease. The compound Sk23 (Fig. 11) showed a weak inhibitory activity. In a way to develop small molecule inhibitors, they further investigated the structural modifications on the inhibitor SK23 and found isoserine backbone could be an alternative to the serine [122] .One of the resulting analog SK40 (83, Fig. 11 ) showed an IC 50 value 43 mM against the mutant protease.

The interferon response can be augmented by the administration of recombinant interferons or interferon inducers. Recombinant interferona and interferon-b inhibit the replication of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in vitro and animal models [84, [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] . Various combinations of interferon-a or-b with other antivirals such as ribavirin and/or lopinavir-ritonavir have been used to treat patients with SARS or MERS. Overall, combination treatments consisting of interferons and ribavirin did not consistently improve outcomes [47] [48] [49] 136, 137] . The apparent discrepancy between in vitro findings and in vivo outcomes may be related to the high EC 50 /Cmax ratios of these drugs and the delay between symptom onset and drug administration [83, 138] . This delay is especially relevant for MERS patients, as they have a much shorter median time interval between symptom onset and death than do SARS patients [139, 42] . The use of recombinant interferon b-1b, which has the lowest EC 50 /Cmaxratio against MERS-CoV among tested preparations of recombinant interferons, should be evaluated in combination with other effective antivirals in clinical trials at early stages of the infection [83, 84] .",

They exhibit broad-spectrum activities against numerous enveloped viruses and may be active against CoVs [164] [165] [166] [167] . In addition to the above-mentioned molecules, there are numerous peptide-based inhibitors of coronaviruses [168] .",

Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitors such as ribavirin and mycophenolic acid inhibit an important step in de novo synthesis of nucleic acids (discussed earlier). Mizoribine, another IMPDH also proved to inhibit the synthesis of nucleic acids. Mizoribine (109, Fig. 14) , an approved immunosuppressant in organ transplantation with limited adverse side effects, has shown in vitro activity against HCV and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and was considered as an alternative to ribavirin/IFN combinations for treatment of HCV infections [169] Mizoribine exerts its activity through selective inhibition of inosine monophosphate synthetase and guanosine monophosphate synthetase, resulting in the complete inhibition of guanine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into nucleotides. The chemotherapeutic gemcitabine has shown in vitro activity against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (discussed earlier). Remdesivir (development code GS-5734, or 110, Fig. 12 ) is an antiviral drug, a novel nucleotide analog prodrug. It was developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, though it has subsequently also been found to show reasonable antiviral activity against more distantly related viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, Junin virus, Lassa fever virus, and MERS-coronavirus [170] . Remdesivir was rapidly pushed through clinical trials due to the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus epidemic crisis, eventually being used in at least one human patient despite its early development stage at the time. Preliminary results were promising and it was used in the emergency setting for the 2018 Kivu Ebola outbreak along with further clinical trials.",
