            "text": "ily. The leader and trailer non-coding regions of the EBOV genome likely regulate its transcription, replication, and progeny genome packaging. We investigated the cis-acting RNA signals involved in RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions that regulate replication of eGFP-encoding EBOV minigenomic RNA and identified heat shock cognate protein family A (HSC70) member 8 (HSPA8) as an EBOV trailer-interacting host protein. Mutational analysis of the trailer HSPA8 binding motif revealed that this interaction is essential for EBOV minigenome replication. Selective 2 -hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension analysis of the secondary structure of the EBOV minigenomic RNA indicates formation of a small stem-loop composed of the HSPA8 motif, a 3 stem-loop (nucleotides 1868-1890) that is similar to a previously identified structure in the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA and a panhandle domain involving a trailer-to-leader interaction. Results of minigenome assays and an EBOV reverse genetic system rescue support a role for both the panhandle domain and HSPA8 motif 1 in virus replication.",

Because of the scarcity of effective treatments against EBOV, there is an urgent need to identify novel viral inhibitors that target specific viral processes. As of yet, relatively little is known about the molecular biology of EBOV replication, and, in particular, the interplay between host factors and the viral genome. The EBOV genome is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA organized into a 3 leader non-coding region (NCR), followed by seven discrete transcriptional units encoding NP (nucleocapsid protein), VP35 (polymerase cofactor and interferonresponse modulator), VP40 (matrix protein), GP 1,2 (glycoprotein), VP30 (transcriptional enhancer), VP24 (secondary matrix protein, ion channel and interferon-response modulator), L (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and a 5 trailer NCR (1, 2) . Each gene is separated by intergenic regions of varying lengths that modulate transcript levels (3) .",

            "text": "The NCRs of RNA virus genomes have highly conserved primary and secondary structures (4) (5) (6) (7) . However, the functions of EBOV NCRs are not well characterized. Replicon systems consisting of the complete trailer and leader sequences and short segments of the L and NP protein genes that flank a reporter gene such as chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, green fluorescent protein, or luciferase have been developed (8) (9) (10) (11) . In these systems, transcription and replication from a replicon genome is supported by the EBOV proteins NP, L, VP35, and VP30, which are driven from co-transfected expression plasmids. Such systems allow examination of virus specific processes involving the RNA and these proteins. Addition of VP40 and GP expres-sion plasmids can drive production of infectious VLPs (10) . Using the minigenome replicon systems and/or computerassisted secondary structure predictions, some functions have been attributed to the NCRs. Computer modeling of the EBOV trailer and leader indicate that a panhandle structure may form between the NCRs starting with base paring of nucleotide (nt) 1 and 18 957. Almost identical hairpin structures for the leader of the EBOV genome and RI RNA are possible (12) . Computer modeling of EBOV mini-RI RNA and mutational analysis suggested that the 3terminal 20 nts of the EBOV leader are not essential for infection (13) . Chemical probing of the EBOV RI RNA revealed a stem-loop within the 5 end that is involved in regulating transcription (14) . Additional probing analyses of mini-RI RNA suggest that the trailer and leader do not interact, but that the terminal 55 nts of the leader are important for replication (15) . Recently, a direct interaction between VP30 and the 3 leader has been described, suggesting that VP30 clamps the RNA template to prevent the polymerase complex (VP35/L) from dissociation and allows productive transcription initiation in the presence of secondary structures in the template (16, 17) . The optimal RNA substrate for VP30 binding is a single-stranded RNA that is linked to a stem-loop, as found in the region of the replication promoter element of the EBOV genomic leader (18) . Other studies further emphasize the importance of non-terminal EBOV RNA secondary structures in transcription and replication. For instance, EBOV GP mRNA editing is dependent on such secondary structures (19) (20) (21) . Interrupting secondary structure formation inhibits synthesis of the mRNA encoding GP 1,2 , which mediates virion entry into host cells.",

However, few host protein-viral RNA interactions have been characterized for negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. Previously, the La autoantigen (Sj\u00f6gren syndrome antigen B) was shown to interact with the leader of rabies virus (30) , vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (31, 32) , and rinderpest virus (32) . La autoantigen is an RNA polymerase III transcription factor that shuttles between the nucleus and cytosol and may play a role in mRNA stability for translation. Interactions between the viral leader and La autoantigen are thought to play a role in replication. Replication is increased when the concentration of La autoantigen is increased (32) indicating a necessary functional role for host proteins to directly interact with the negative-sense viral genome. However, no specific viral RNA secondary structures that interact with La or other host proteins have been identified.",

The 1-730 probe followed a similar pattern as the 1-116 probe and could be significantly competed with wt unlabeled probe and 50\u00d7 and 100\u00d7 tRNA ( Figure 1D ). The data suggests that the RNP complex formation is specific because low to moderate concentrations of wt competitor and the highest concentrations of tRNA were required for significant competition.",

IP-RT-PCR confirmed the HSPA8:1-116 interaction ( Figure 2C and D). Specific 1-116 probe PCR products were detected only when cell lysates and 1-116 probe were immunoprecipitated with anti-HSPA8 antibody. 1-116 probe could not be detected by PCR in control samples excluding antibody, thus supporting a specific interaction between HSPA8 and the 1-116 probe. Following identification of HSPA8, a literature search was performed indicating that HSPA8 interacts with a pentanucleotide motif, 5 AUUUA3 , (51) (52) (53) (54) . Closer examination of the EBOV trailer sequence identified three of these motifs at nt positions 26-30, 620-624 and 669-673.",

Variants of motif 1 were generated containing either a single point mutation or clustered multiple point mutations. The effect of these variants on EBOV transcription/replication was examined in the context of the 3E-5E-GFP minigenome assay using 293T cells. The 3E-5E-GFP minigenome assay is a transfectionbased replicon system. Expression plasmids encoding the EBOV VP30, VP35, L and NP proteins are co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the 3E-5E-GFP minigenome that is driven by a T7 promoter and an expression plasmid encoding the T7 polymerase (T7pol). The minigenome is described in detail in Watanabe et al. (10) . Briefly the 5 and 3 ends of the EBOV genome flank a eGFP open reading frame (ORF) as a reporter gene and is replication and transcription competent. Single-nucleotide changes in motif 1 of the minigenome indicated that an A30U (5 AUUUU3 ) mutation resulted in a statistically significant (P < 0.0001) decrease in both the total number of GFP-positive cells (47% decrease, Figure 3A ) and in the mean fluorescence intensity of the GFP signal (43% decrease) ( Figure 3B ). The A26U/A30U double mutant (5 UUUUU3 ) motif resulted in a significant decrease in GFP-positive cells (75%, P < 0.0001, Figure 3A and B). Northern blots specifically targeting the genome and RI RNAs were performed on the wt and mutant minigenome samples to determine which step of the virus lifecycle was impacted by mutagenesis of motif 1. Based on previous identification of VP35 as essential for replication and transcription in an EBOV minigenome assay, (55), a control omitting expression of VP35 (VP35(\u2212)) was included to determine the level of T7pol produced minigenome RNA. This control is necessary to determine the level of minigenome produced by the viral proteins. If the mutant does not impact minigenome synthesis, then the northern blot signal intensity will be increased when compared to VP35(\u2212) and equal to the wt sample. If the mutant impacts minigenome RNA synthesis, then the northern blot signal intensity will be lower than wild type or equal to the VP35(\u2212) signal or greater than the wt signal. The data indicate that four of five single point mutations, A26U, U28A, U29A and A30U, in motif 1 reduced minigenome RNA synthesis. The A30U mutant demonstrated the greatest impact and was below the VP35(\u2212) signal ( Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure S1A ), however the U27A mutant did not impact minigenome RNA synthesis. The double mutants A26U/U27A, A26U/U28A, and A26U/A30U also reduced minigenome RNA synthesis when compared to wt. These data indicate that motif 1 is involved in minigenome RNA synthesis.",

Mutants A26U, U27A, U29A, A26U/U27A, A26U/U28A and A26U/U29A demonstrated variable but near wt levels of RI RNA synthesis. These data indicate that motif 1 also plays a role in RI RNA synthesis.

Thus, the possibility exists that this hairpin (nt 1879-1884) forms an H-type pseudoknot structure with the 5 upstream complementary region (nt 1863-1868). Pseudoknots play a critical role in many biological activities, from regulation of viral gene expression to catalysis of mRNA splicing and repeat-addition processivity of human telomerase (58, 59) . Subsequent experiments involving LNA-directed displacement of the putative pseudoknot interaction (aiSHAPE) (40) did not change reactivity of apical loop residues or flanking regions (data not shown).

These include a bifurcated stem-loop at the 5 terminus (nts 38-204), a stem-loop occluding HSPA8 motifs 2 and 3 (nts 552-624) and the hairpin structure previously proposed as VP30binding site (nts 1813-1835) ( Figure 4D ).

This single nucleotide substitution eliminated formation of the nt 28-37 hairpin (containing HSPA8 motif 1 in wt RNA), and introduced an A:C mispair (nt A15, C1931), and an asymmetric internal loop (nt 22-24 and 1925) ( Figure 4E) . Similarly, the A26U/A30U point mutations caused structural rearrangements of the panhandle duplex, again eliminating the nt 28-37 stem-loop and introducing a mismatch at position 15 and an additional internal loop (G19-U23 and C1924-U1928) ( Figure 4F and Supplementary Figure S7 ).",

The role of HSPs in the viral lifecycle is only just being unveiled (62) (63) (64) . Numerous studies also indicate that specific interactions of host proteins with viral secondary and tertiary RNA motifs modulate the lifecycle (65, 66) . In this manuscript, we provide novel insight into the structural conformation of EBOV NCRs, identify a specific RNA motif within the trailer that interacts with a host cell chaperone, HSPA8, and define the role of this protein/RNA interaction in viral replication. EMSA (Figure 1) , followed by protein pull-downs, mass spectrometry, and IP-RT-PCR ( Figure 2 ) allowed us to identify and confirm that HSPA8 interacts with the first 50 nts of the EBOV trailer region. HSPA8, a member of the HSC70 family, is a host chaperone that assists mis-folded polypeptide chains to (re)fold into functional proteins and is crucial for cell survival during stress (60) . HSC70 also interacts with HCV particles; HSC70 downregulation significantly reduced virus production either via modulation of viral assembly or release (61) . In addition, HSC70 was shown to be part of a protein complex that includes HCV NS5A and host proteins HSP70 and HSP40 (62) and was demonstrated to assist the NS5A/HSP70 complex essential for HCV IRES-mediated translation. HSC70 is also recruited to reovirus viral factories (63) and is present in influenza A virus (64) , and vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus viral particles (65) .",

Sequence analysis of the 3E-5E-GFP minigenomic RNA suggested three putative HSPA8 motifs in the trailer. However, the exact structural conformation of these regions was undefined. Thus, using chemical acylation techniques and site-directed mutagenesis, we determined the secondary structure of 3E-5E-GFP EBOV minigenome RNA and demonstrated that its 5 and 3 NCRs form complex long-range RNA interactions including a trailer-to-leader panhandle ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S2 ). Closer analysis indicates that motif 1 forms part of a small stem-loop (nts 28-37) that is in near proximity to the VP30 binding stem-loop (nts 1868-1890). To further investigate the role of the 5 terminal 50 nt in the 5 -3 interaction and the importance of HSPA8 motif 1, a deletion mutant was evaluated by chemical probing and in the context of an EBOV infectious clone. SHAPE data indicate that deleting trailer sequences caused structural changes within the 3E-5E-GFP minigenome RNA, mainly due to the release of the leader sequences for base pairing with complementary regions ( Figure 4D ; Supplementary Figures S4 and 5 ). These structural rearrangements did not affect the topology of other RNA domains. Experiments with the infectious clone system indicated that EBOV mutant 2-56 was not viable (Table 2 ). Since HSPA8 motif 1 is located within the 5 terminal 50 nts of the trailer, it is difficult to unambiguously determine if the panhandle structure or the HSPA8 motif 1 is necessary for virus growth, but such data do reinforce the importance of HSPA8 motif 1.",

No other RNA domains outside of the 5 -3 interaction were changed (Supplementary Figures S6 and  7) , suggesting that the trailer-to-leader interaction forms an independent structural/regulatory element essential for efficient virus replication. Hybridization of LNA/DNA chimeras to the leader did not induce extensive structural changes within upstream domains. These data suggest that the trailer-to-leader panhandle might indeed function as an autonomous element (Supplementary Figure S3) . The infectious clone system experiments also indicated that EBOV mutant A26U/A30U was not viable. On the other hand, the A30U mutant was rescued but with slower kinetics. Sequence analysis indicated an A insertion into the the GP open reading frame in 87% of the viral RNAs at position 6579.

The first 21 nts of the interacting 5 -3 regions form an extended arm that is positioned orthogonally to the interacting HSPA8/1868-1890 motifs. The spatial proximity of these elements suggests a potential molecular bridging between HSPA8/VP30 and their specific RNA-binding motifs.

Furthermore, northern blot data indicated a reduction in both minigenome and RI RNA production of the A30U mutant ( Figure 3D and Supplementary Figure S1 ). The A26U/A30U double mutation also resulted in reduced RI RNA and minigenome synthesis. Since the RI RNA serves a template for synthesis of the minigenome RNA, reduction in minigenome RNA most likely directly affects production of RI RNA. In addition, EMSA analysis of the A30U mutant demonstrated reduced host protein/viral RNA/RNP complex formation ( Figure  3E ). It is interesting that siRNA-directed ( Figure 3G ) or chemical inhibition (data not shown) of HSPA8 moderately reduced infectivity and viral titer, respectively, whereas EBOV genome mutagenesis that targets the HSPA8 binding motif led to nonviable virus.",

Our studies indicate that HSPA8 plays a critical role in production of viral genomic and RI RNAs. During transcription and replication, the viral genome must become a template for synthesis of progeny RNA. This process involves uncoating or at least relaxation of the viral RNP. Host factors likely interact with the viral RNP to maintain proximity of necessary factors and aid complex formation to initiate and complete these processes (67) (68) (69) . It is likely that many of these interactions are weak and transient, acting as scaffolds for virus-driven processes. These transient interactions may assist proper RNA folding for RI RNA synthesis, transcription complex formation, or proper confirmation of packaging signals to drive discrimination by viral components to ensure effective packaging of full-length genomes and reduction of defective particles.",
