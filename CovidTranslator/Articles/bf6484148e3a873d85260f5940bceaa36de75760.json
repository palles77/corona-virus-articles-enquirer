Method: The study was conducted in hospitals in Makkah during the 2016 and 2017 Hajj seasons. Structured questionnaire was used to collect data on relevant indices on TB management and a scoring system was developed to assess compliance with guidelines. Results: Data was collected from 31 TB cases, 65.4% (17/26) were Saudi residents. Sputum culture was the only diagnostic test applied in 67.7% (21/31) of patients. Most (96.8%, 30/31) confirmed TB cases were isolated, but only 12.9% (4/28) were tested for HIV and merely 37% (10/27) received the recommended four 1st-line anti-TB drugs. Guideline compliance scores were highest for infection prevention and control and surveillance (9.6/10) and identifying TB suspects (7.2/10). The least scores were obtained for treating TB (5.0/10) and diagnosing TB (3.0/10). Conclusions: Healthcare providers training and supervision are paramount to improve their knowledge and skill and ensure their compliance with existing TB management guidelines. However, there may be a need for the introduction of an international policy/guideline for TB control and management during mass gatherings such as the Hajj to guide providers' choices and facilitate monitoring.",

In 2017, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that 10 million people developed active TB causing up to 1.6 million deaths [1] . The WHO's End-TB strategy aims to reduce the overall number of TB deaths by 95% and the TB incidence rate by 90% in 2035 compared with the 2015 baseline incidence and mortality figures [2] . Key to achieving these targets is the early diagnosis and appropriate management of TB cases worldwide according to national and international guidelines [3] [4] [5] [6] . This includes in the context of mass gatherings such as the annual Hajj in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), where over 2 million pilgrims, many originating from TB endemic areas, congregate in crowded settings and worship under conditions that increase the risk of TB transmission [7, 8] .",

However, while TB cases have been reported during the event [10, 11] , TB management approaches during this unique event remained largely undocumented, and it is unknown whether these are consistent with the KSA and international TB management guidelines. Hospitals in Makkah serve both Hajj pilgrims as well as local residents and the Hajj workforce during the mass gathering free of charge. The additional stress on these health facilities during Hajj may compromise the services provided for all patients during the event, including those diagnosed with TB. This study documents the management of drug-sensitive TB patients during Hajj and explores the compliance of healthcare providers with the KSA TB management guidelines in the Ministry of Health (MOH) hospitals in Makkah during the mass gathering.",

The themes were 1) identifying TB suspect, 2) IPC and surveillance, 3) diagnosing TB and 4) treating drug-sensitive TB. For each theme, relevant indicators were identified from the questionnaire (Tables 2-5) . A score of 1 was assigned for each indicator/variable that was consistent with the 2014 KSA TB management guideline [6] (latest version during study period) and 0 for inconsistency with the guideline.

However, implementation of IPC recommendations seems to be inadequate with several studies reporting poor TB infection control measures in health facilities [21] [22] [23] [24] . Further, many HCWs are practicing without adequate infection control training and often lack knowledge on TB infection control strategies and guidelines [24, 25] . In the current study, we report high compliance with the aspects of TB IPC [26] . Early detection through systematic screening of TB suspects is key to improving TB case detection. The WHO recommends that persons with signs and symptoms consistent with TB should be evaluated for TB to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment [3, 5] . Similarly, the Saudi TB guideline recommends that healthcare workers (HCWs) should be knowledgeable about TB symptoms to facilitate the efficient identification of TB suspects for diagnosis and treatment [6] . In the current study, providers utilized presenting symptoms to correctly identify suspected TB patients in all cases. Cough and fever with chills/night sweat were the most frequent symptoms among patients. This finding corroborates existing evidence that identifies cough as the most common symptom of PTB [3, 27] . Further, in majority of cases (67.7%, 21/31), chest X-ray, a recommended screening tool for active TB, was conducted for the TB suspects. Chest X-ray is particularly more sensitive for TB screening after a positive symptom screening [27] . However, we also found that less than half of the TB suspected cases were questioned about TB risk factors. Adequate knowledge of TB symptoms and risk factors among providers are prerequisites for correct and prompt identification of suspected TB patients for screening and diagnosis [5, 6] . In view of the significant use of both symptom-based and radiological screening methods in this study, a total guideline compliance score of 7.2 out of 10 was obtained for the prompt identification and screening of TB suspects theme for TB management.",

In the current study, half of the TB cases had more than 2 visits to healthcare facilities before TB screening/diagnosis tests were ordered for the patients. While studies from other settings reported similar findings [30, 31] , our results are concerning, as delays in diagnosing TB during Hajj may lead to significant transmission given the crowded setting during the event. Similarly, sputum culture (which takes at least 2-3 weeks to produce results) was the only recommended diagnostic test applied in about 70% (21/31) of cases. The application of sputum culture as the singular diagnostic test is not consistent with approved standards for TB diagnosis [6] . As 75% (18/24) of suspected cases were confirmed to have TB by the third day of arrival in the health facility, it appears that providers relied on screening tests, such as chest X-ray, for the confirmation of TB diagnosis. This practice is inconsistent with both national and international guidelines; chest radiography is only recommended for screening purposes.",

Nonetheless, Xpert MTB/RIF, which could detect TB and MDR-TB by proxy in the same day [32] , was not applied for TB diagnosis in this study. Although available in a number of Saudi hospitals and reference labs, the roll out of Xpert MTB/RIF has been slow and its use for pointof-care testing is limited [7, 33] . Access to same day diagnosis of TB could prove valuable in a highly mobile Hajj population where followup visits to the same health facility may not be guaranteed and where delays in diagnosis may increase the risk of transmission in such crowded settings.

As a low prevalence setting, knowledge of HIV among healthcare workers is low in Saudi Arabia [34] . Yet, HIV could be a more frequent comorbidity among pilgrims who arrive with active TB from areas with high HIV disease prevalence [1] . More so, a missed or delayed HIV diagnosis in a TB patient stalls the commencement of appropriate treatment and results in poor outcomes for the patient, community and health system [35] . Therefore, healthcare providers in KSA ought to be trained and guided to conduct screening for HIV and other comorbidities in all suspected TB patients irrespective of their nationality. In general, because of delays in diagnosis, infrequency of HIV testing and failure to utilize the appropriate diagnostic tests for suspect TB patients, the combined score for the TB diagnosis theme was 3 out of a maximum of 10, the lowest score of all TB management themes in the current study.",

The guideline compliance score for TB treatment in this study was average; partly because 63% (17/27) of TB patients received fewer than four 1st-line anti-TB drugs. In general, inappropriate treatment of TB is common worldwide. In a systematic review that included 37 studies from 22 countries, inappropriate treatment regimens were prescribed in 67% of the studies and the percentage of patients on inappropriate regimens varied between 0.4% and 100% [36] . Poor knowledge of national and international TB management guidelines contributes to inappropriate prescription of anti-TB drugs by healthcare providers, and the use of inappropriate regimen drives the occurrence of relapse and the emergence of drugresistant TB [37, 38] . Both the WHO and KSA TB guidelines recommend that all patients with PTB being treated with the 1st-line regimen should have their sputum samples tested by the end of the 2nd, 5th and 6th month of treatment [6, 39] . In the current study, all confirmed TB cases with known notification status were reported to the Saudi health authorities. However, it is unknown whether the continuum of care was maintained for TB cases who were international pilgrims and who had to return to their home countries soon after the pilgrimage (before the end of the treatment period). Any travel-related treatment interruptions could breed treatment relapse and drug-resistance and propagate community spread of TB. Both national and international TB guidelines fall short of providing guidance on TB control at international mass gatherings, including procedures for ensuring access to care and support services during travel. Thus, the development and dissemination of a multinational Hajj and Umrah and/or mass gatherings-specific TB management protocols are needed. These protocols should also include pathways for the safe transfer across borders and follow up of TB patients involved in mass gatherings.",

In the short term, availability of rapid molecular diagnostic techniques for TB as we all improving HCWs' knowledge regarding TB management guidelines and monitoring compliance are needed to ensure TB patients are management appropriately during Hajj and that TB transmission is prevented.",
