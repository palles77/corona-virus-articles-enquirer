Therefore, the understanding of viral strategies to manipulate cell function disrupting plant defenses and enhancing viral infection cycles is fundamental to the production of virus-resistant plant lines. After invading susceptible plants, viruses create conditions that favor local and systemic infections by suppressing multiple layers of innate host defenses while use cellular machinery to own benefit. Viral interference in interlinked essential cellular functions results in phenotypic changes and disease symptoms, which debilitates plants favoring infection establishment. Herein in this review, the novelty it will be the discussion about the strategies used by (+) single strand RNA viruses to affect cellular processes and components to improve viral replication, in parallel to overcome plant defenses, favoring disease establishment by applying in one action using the same viral protein to coordinate viral replication and breaking down plant defense. This focus on plant-virus interaction was never done before, and this knowledge has the potential to help in the development of new strategies to produce resistant plants.",

Chlorosis and mosaic formation are typical symptoms of viral infection in plants. These symptoms are the consequence of chloroplasts shut off induced by the virus (Li et al. 2006) . For instance, Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) induces chlorotic symptoms by two mechanisms; (1) accumulating coat protein on PSII core complex (Lehto et al. 2003) and (2) reducing the level of thylakoid membrane oxygen-evolving complex proteins (Abbink et al. 2002) during the replication process.

However, despite a diverse set of plant defense mechanisms, in some cases, plants cannot prevent viral infection leading to disease establishment. Thus, the balance between these two different biological processes will be determinant to generate a compatible or incompatible plant-virus interaction. However, despite the importance of RNA viruses for crop productivity, deeper comprehension of the establishment of a compatible or incompatible plant-virus interaction is still lacking. Based on this fact, a question is raised: how do RNA viruses overcome plant defenses and replicate themselves and how they employ different host factors to reach this?",

For example, TMV infection, which occurs outside of chloroplasts, is followed by CP (coat protein) accumulation at the PSII complex in thylakoids membranes and thus inhibition of electron transport within and starting at PSII. As a result, chloroplasts suffer impairment in the energetic balance involving light absorbance and metabolic energy, causing photoinhibition (Hodgson et al. 1989) . Besides that, viruses can also interact with chloroplast proteins and induce the formation of membranes vesicles in improving viral replication. This viral-derived vesicle also generates severe alterations in chloroplast morphology, impairing its functions to plants (Liu et al. 2014; Li et al. 2016) .",

At this point, with disarmed chloroplasts, plants can do nothing to avoid viral replication in the chloroplast. Viruses induced a decrease in chlorophyll levels, which in turn result damage in photosystems and hence in the entire chloroplast machinery. This is also an important strategy to prevent ROS production. Changes in chlorophyll content are evident in studies that compare susceptible and resistance to the same viruses. For example, a recently published paper involving Cowpea severe mosaic virus (CPSMV, genus Comovirus) infection in susceptible cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) plants evidenced a reduction of 32 and 40% in chlorophyll b and a, respectively, in comparison to resistant plants (Souza et al. 2017) . In this work, it is clear that the changes in chlorophyll are important steps for symptom development and disease establishment. Up to date, two possible explanations about how viruses can interfere with the normal metabolism of chlorophyll were provided by two independent research groups.",

In this case, the authors used the African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV genus Begomovirus) a DNA viruses; however, the discussion of this point is still relevant. These authors reported that mosaic phenotype coincides with upregulation of genes involved with chlorophyll degradation, followed by the reduction in the content of chlorophyll in leaves. In this study, the authors also reported the expression increase in two genes related to pheophytinase (PPH) and pheophorbide an oxygenase (PaO) ( Table 1) , both involved in chlorophyll degradation. An interestingly point in this analysis is the fact that genes involved in chlorophyll synthesis as the gene for magnesium chelatase subunit I was drastically down-regulated. In this way, ACMV induces chlorophyll degradation and also avoid chlorophyll synthesis, leading to the mosaic establishment. This type of activity was not described yet to RNA viruses; however, the discussion and knowledge brought with it are important, because several RNA viruses induce the reduction of chlorophyll in plants during infection, and this mechanism might being applied for some RNA viruses even though is described yet.",

The interaction of DNA viruses and retroviruses is completely understandable once they need nuclear factors to complete their replication process. On the opposite way, (+) strand RNA viruses replicate the process in the cytoplasm. Consequently, an important question could be raised here: As such, why RNA viruses do need to interact with the plant nucleus? What is the biological relevance for this interaction? The answers for these questions are still conflicting, especially because several works involving enucleated cells about the important/function of the nucleus in replication of (+) strand RNA viruses realized with enucleated cells showed that (+) strand RNA viruses can replicate normally under such conditions, but and the enucleation in these experiments, in some cases, virus replication was also decreased (Evans et al. 1980 ). Thus, a consensus regarding the roles played on nuclear metabolism during (+) strand RNA viruses seems to be a hard task to address.",

            "text": "To comprehend the importance of virus-nucleus interactions to virus replication, an important question needs to be solved: what is the \"password\" that allows viruses to access the nucleus? Possibly, viruses can employ two distinct strategies to bypass this limitation: (1) viruses can develop proteins with the signal sequence to the nucleus; (2) they can develop proteins able to interact with nuclear host proteins and subsequently to reach within the nucleus (Table 1) . A great example of the first strategy is reported for potyviruses that have proteins with the nuclear signal. Potyviruses possess two nuclear inclusion protein an (NIa) and b (NIb), which interacts with several nuclear host proteins and therefore might induce assembly of a viral replication complex in the host nucleus (Revers et al. 2015) . For instance, it has been postulated that the interaction of TuMV-NIb with nuclear factors such as SCE1 is an important event to TuMV replication. To confirm the importance of this interaction for TuMV replication, TuMV carrying a mutant form of Nib that fails in interact with SCE1 is not able to replicate in N. benthamiana (Xiong et al. 2013 ). Direct interaction with nuclear proteins is an important strategy to access nuclear environment and is employed by several plant viruses (Evans et al. 1980; Kim et al. 2007; Li et al. 2018) . To different studies, one point is the consensus for (+) RNA viruses: viral proteins can traffic within and without nucleus by using NPC interaction. This movement is very important to virus life cycle because either viral proteins are required for any replication step in the nucleus (i.e., bind viral RNA to transcription factors) or in a cytoplasmic step (i.e., encapsidation) proteins can be recruited to place which is required (Hiscox 2007) . Also, this ability to come in and out from the nucleus is a clear example of how virus \"kills two birds with one stone\". Because the interaction with nuclear protein helps viral replication while interferes with nuclear function in plant defense.",

            "text": "The interaction between tomato plants and Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV, genus Tombusvirus) provides consistent data to prove that viruses \"kill two birds with one stone\" (Fig. 1A) . In these interactions, the protein p19 encoded by TBSV, which has a site of replication peroxisome, shown two essential functions for virus replication. First, p19 bind to ALY (an mRNA-export factor from the nucleus) leading to the redistribution of this protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which results in shutting down of cell host protein synthesis and favor TBSV cell-to-cell movement. Second, the same p19 protein is transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus by ALY and inhibit plant RNA silencing (i.e., the main plant antiviral immunity) preventing viral RNA degradation (Uhrig et al. 2004 ). Two studies published previously (Matsushita et al. 2001; Levy et al. 2013 ) provide strong pieces of evidence about how the virus, especially virus from Tobamovirus family, can impair nuclear functions. First, the P30, a movement protein encoded by Turnip vein clearing virus (TVCV, genus Tobamovirus), was unexpected localized in the nucleus during Arabidopsis thaliana infection. In the nucleus, the TVCV P30 was found interacting with actin filaments associated with chromatin to enhance TVCV movement from the initially infected cells. Sequencing data of TVCV P30 revealed the presence of an NLS domain. Point mutations inserted in NLS of the TVCV P30 result in complete blocking of P30 access to the nucleus and consequentially dramatic reduction in TVCV long-distance movement (Levy et al. 2013) . Matsushita et al. (2001) reported that P30 protein from Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV, genus Tobamovirus) interacts with a transcriptional coactivator factor KELP to access nucleus and facilitate viral movement. KELP protein is an important coactivator factor involved with expression of defense-related genes, in that way, the subversion of KELP by ToMV to work on in viral movement makes this unavailable for the plant which in turn impair defense-related genes expression weakening plant defense. Therefore, in one shot ToMV uses a plant protein to moves and to inhibit plant defense, this is a clear example of \"kill two birds with one stone\". During Groundnut rosette virus (GRV, Umbravirus) the ORF3 protein interacts with a nuclear protein to perform a cell-to-cell movement of GRV. The GRV is an uncommon virus, different from other plant viruses; GRV does not produce a coat protein, resulting in non-conventional virus particles in infected plants (Ryabov et al. 1998; Ryabov et al. 1999; Ryabov et al. 2001; Kim et al. 2007 ). To compensate for the lack of CP GRV produces the ORF3 protein, which is responsible for virus accumulation and mainly in cell-tocell movement (Ryabov et al. 1999; Ryabov et al. 2001) . Interestingly, during GRV infection, ORF3 was found in the nucleus (Fig. 1 B) , an unexpected address, because the GRV replication is completely restricted to the cytoplasm. However, analyses of the ORF3 shown two conserved domains called Arginine-and Leucine-rich domains, both essential to importing and nuclear localization, suggesting ORF3 protein traffic between nucleus and cytoplasm in infected cells (Ryabov et al. 1998; Ryabov et al. 1999) . Kim et al. (2007) showed that ORF3 protein interacts with a nuclear protein called fibrillarin (FIB). In this study, pieces of evidence support the interaction of GRV protein was not related to viral replication, but instead linked to GRV long-distance movement and systemic infection. The ORF3 protein can move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and them, rapidly, moves back to the cytoplasm. At the end of this movement cytoplasm/nucleus/cytoplasm of ORF3 recruits fibrillarin from the nucleus to cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, fibrillarin works in the production of GRV ribonucleoproteins (RNP) (Fig. 1B) particles that are capable of perform longdistance movement (Kim et al. 2007) .",

The interaction of viral proteins with FIB is important for two reasons: (1) FIB is critical to longdistance movement (Fig. 1B) , and (2) once virus redistribute FIB protein from nucleus to cytoplasm, the protein cannot display its function in mRNA to translation, in this way impairs cellular protein synthesis and any change to establish defense against viral infection.",

In this study, a p27 auxiliary protein from the Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV, genus Dianthovirus) possesses two domains important to RCNMV replication in N. benthamiana. One of those domains in the N-terminal region is an amphipathic \u03b1-helix that can be inserted in the ER membrane, which is responsible for p27 protein localization in the ER and hence RCNMV. However, this domain is not enough to guarantee RCNMV replication in the ER membrane. The second domain, nevertheless, cannot bind to the ER membrane but is required to induce the formation of the replication complex, and in that way stimulate RCNMV in ER membrane. Also, Mine et al. (2012) reported that p27 interacts with a heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSP70) from ER to drive the formation of a 480-kDa-replication complex on ER. Also, the authors showed that when p27-HSP70 interaction is inhibited, p27 can form the complex. However, the complex is not functional, and RCNMV not happens. This result clearly shows the dependence of RCNMV of HSP70 to complete the replication process . By using the functions of HSP70, an essential protein involved in protein folding, this protein cannot display this role in ER protein synthesis; this could deeply impair protein synthesis.",

During TBSV infection p33 protein interact with Pex19p forming a complex host-viral protein called p33-Pex19, which address TBSV replication to the peroxisome. Based on the activity of Pex19, several membrane-bound vesicles are induced in peroxisome to form a replication vesicle. The interaction between p33 and Pex19 is driven by an mPTS (peroxisomal membrane targeting sequences) domain present in p33 leading to insertion in the peroxisomal membrane. Once the complex p33-Pex19 arrives in the peroxisome, the vesicle induction is started, and Pex19p remains until the complete formation of TBSV replication vesicle. At this moment, the p33-Pex19 complex is disassembled and p33 forms a new complex with p92pol, TBSV RNA replication is launched (Pathak et al. 2008; . To prove that p33 is the protein in charge during TBSV replication and the importance of interaction with Pex19p, in an elegant experiment Pathak and collaborators (Pathak et al. 2008) , produced a mutant Pex19p with signal sequence addressed to mitochondria rather than peroxisome, and as expected TBSV replication was done in the mitochondrial membrane, instead peroxisome as usual. This experiment proves the importance and dependence of TBSV replication of p33: Pex19. This information has a great value to be used as a biotechnological approach to producing plants resistant to TBSV infection.",

Not enough, p33 can be submitted to post-translational modifications (i.e., phosphorylation) by cellular machinery , what is the objective of post-translational modification in a viral protein? This is a question without an answer yet, but we can propose that these may improve some aspects of TBSV replication and infection, besides to be a great example of how TBSV manipulates cellular machinery. TBSV p33 protein is an example that plant viruses evolve over the years to be masters in manipulating cellular to improve viral replication and disease establishment.

The cellular options available for virus use are massive, allowing the virus to choice either organelles or protein to improve the replication process. Possibly, at the beginning of plant-virus interactions only proteins were used to improve viral replication. In this case, plant developed new proteins preventing viral usage and replication.
