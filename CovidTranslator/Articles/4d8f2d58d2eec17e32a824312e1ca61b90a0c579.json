Conversely, infection of CRIB cells, but not BK cells, with BHV-1 increased IFN-\u03b23 RNA levels and to a lesser extent the other two IFN-\u03b2 subtypes. Inhibition of de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide resulted in higher levels of IFN-\u03b21 and IFN-\u03b22 RNA levels after BHV-1 infection. Further studies demonstrated that BHV-1 immediate early and/or early genes were primarily responsible for inhibiting the IFN response in BK cells. The three bovine IFN-\u03b2 promoters were cloned upstream of a reporter gene construct, and their properties analyzed in transient transfection assays. Only the IFN-\u03b23 promoter was trans-activated by IRF3 (interferon responsive factor 3). IRF7 and double stranded RNA (polyIC) stimulated IFN-\u03b21 and IFN-\u03b23 promoter activity, but not IFN-\u03b22. Relative to the human IFN-\u03b2 promoter, the IFN-\u03b23 promoter contained fewer nucleotide differences in the positive regulatory domain III (PRD III), PRD IV, and PRD I compared to the IFN-\u03b21 and IFN-\u03b22 promoter. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that virus infection differentially stimulates expression of the three bovine IFN-\u03b2 genes.",

In contrast to humans or mice, cattle contain three IFN-\u03b2 genes with distinct promoters (Valarcher et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 1983) . All three bovine IFN-\u03b2 isotypes have anti-viral activity, but it is not clear whether virus infection differentially induces the three subtypes. Viral regulation of IFN responses is crucial for survival in nature and pathogenesis. For example, mice lacking type I and type II IFN receptors in combination with RAG-2 gene deletions die within a few days following infection with bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) (Abril et al., 2004) , an alpha-herpesvirinae subfamily member. Conversely, infection of wt mice with BHV-1 does not lead to clinical symptoms. BHV-1 induces an IFN response, in part due to its high CpG content (Lundberg et al., 2003) . It is assumed that DNA \"sensors\" and/or toll like receptors that recognize unmethylated CpG DNA motifs, TLR9 for example (Bowie and Unteerholzner, 2008) , recognize incoming BHV-1 DNA and induces an IFN response. During the course of productive infection, viral encoded products, including infected cell protein 0 (bICP0), interfere with innate immune responses {reviewed by (Jones, 2009 )}.",

BHV-1 initiates BRD by immunosuppressing cattle (Carter et al., 1989; Griebel et al., 1990; Griebel et al., 1987a; Griebel et al., 1987b; Yates, 1982) , which leads to secondary bacterial infections and lifethreatening pneumonia (Yates, 1982) .

Modified live vaccines are available, and in general, they prevent clinical disease in adults. However, vaccine strains are immunosuppressive, can cause serious disease in young calves or abortions in pregnant cows, and can reactivate from latency. Thus, there is a need to better understand the mechanism by which BHV-1 suppresses immune responses, in particular innate immune responses.",

For the bovine IFN\u03b2-1 promoter, the forward primer was 5\u2032-AAGGTACCCCTCTCCCCAAATCTC-3\u2032 and the reverse primer was 5\u2032-CTCGAGGTCCTTCGTCCTTAAGTG-3\u2032.

The respective amplification products were cloned into the CAT vector, pCAT-basic reporter plasmid (Promega, catalog no. E1871) at the unique XhoI and KpnI restriction enzyme sites.

In a previous study, we developed primers that specifically amplify the three IFN-\u03b2 subtypes (Perez, et al. 2008 ).

In contrast to Sendai infection, BHV-1 infection of CRIB cells increased IFN-\u03b23 RNA levels 10-11 fold at 16 or 24 hours after infection (Figure 1) , which was consistent with a previous study using a different established bovine cell line (Perez et al., 2008) .

Similar results were observed for Sendai and BHV-1 in two other low passage bovine cells derived from turbinate or testicles (data not shown).

The differences in the IFN-\u03b2 response following BHV-1 infection of established CRIB cells versus low passage BK cells were unexpected. The results in BK cells were the same in low passage bovine cells derived from turbinate or testicles (data not shown). Blocking de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide was necessary for inducing IFN-\u03b21 and IFN-\u03b22, but not IFN-\u03b23, RNA levels in low passage bovine cells after BHV-1 infection. The PAA studies further suggest that IE and/or E viral genes were primarily involved with inhibiting IFN-\u03b2 gene expression. When primary human cells are infected with HSV-1, IFN-\u03b2 RNA is not readily detected unless de novo protein synthesis is inhibited (Nicholl et al., 2000; Preston et al., 2001) . Surprisingly, low passage cells were more sensitive to the effects of viral proteins encoded by HSV-1 or BHV-1 that inhibit IFN-\u03b2 signaling pathways. The reason why BHV-1 proteins inhibited IFN-\u03b2 signaling in low passage cells more efficiently than established cells is not understood.",

In general, these studies suggested that binding of the BHV-1 virion and/or viral entry induced IFN-\u03b2 RNA expression in low passage BK cells. Viral protein expression, bICP0 for example, may interfere with stimulation of IFN-\u03b2 RNA expression after infection of low passage bovine cells.

Based on our studies, we suggest that the presence of three bovine IFN-\u03b2 genes with distinct promoters ensures that an efficient and rapid innate immune response occurs after infection. In mice, more than a dozen IFN-\u03b1 genes are clustered on chromosome 4 (Nadeau et al., 1986; Pitha and Au, 1995) . It is believed that multiple IFN-\u03b1 genes are important because immediate early expression of IFN-\u03b14 (Marie et al., 1998) helps to provide a rapid response to virus infection. The sequential induction of delayed IFN-\u03b1 genes provides a mechanism to amplify the protective response to virus infection. The finding that Sendai virus induced a different IFN-\u03b2 response when compared to BHV-1 further suggested that distinct signaling pathways regulate activation of the respective bovine IFN-\u03b2 subtypes.",

Since the IFN-\u03b23 promoter has only one nucleotide difference in the PRD I and PRD III sequences relative to the human promoter ( Figure 4A ), we suggest that sequence variability within PRD I and PRD III of the IFN-\u03b21 and IFN-\u03b22 promoters was the primary reason these promoters were not trans-activated by IRF3. For example, the IFN-\u03b21 promoter contained 3 nucleotide differences in PRD III and PRD I sequences and the IFN-\u03b22 promoter contained 7 nucleotide differences in these domains. The IFN-\u03b22 promoter was not activated by PolyI:C, IRF3, or IRF7 suggesting that the relative low levels of IFN-\u03b22 RNA after infection by BHV-1 or Sendai virus was probably not due to virus encoded or induced products. Collectively, these studies indicated that the 11 nucleotide mismatches in PRD IV, PRD III, and PRD I of IFN-\u03b22 (Wathelet et al., 1998b ) ( Figure 4A ) interfered with high levels of activation by transcription factors that stimulated the other two bovine IFN-\u03b2 promoters.",

Although IFN-\u03b23 RNA levels were induced when CRIB cells were infected with BHV-1, this was not the case in low passage bovine cells (even in the presence of cycloheximide), which resulted only in an increase of IFN-\u03b21 and IFN-\u03b22 RNA levels. These results were in contrast to the transient transfection studies that were performed. There are several possible reasons for these differences. For example, additional promoter sequences may be necessary for stimulating IFN-\u03b21 and IFN-\u03b22 RNA levels following infection with Sendai or BHV-1. It is also unlikely that the chromatin structure of the respective IFN-\u03b2 promoters in the CAT expression plasmids were the same as found in the context of the bovine genome, and this may have influenced the activation of IFN-\u03b2 subtypes. Studies designed to further understand the signaling pathways that lead to IFN-\u03b2 expression in cattle following infection are in progress.",

The position of the human IFN-\u03b2 enhancesome, which is required for activating the IFN response is divided into four transcription factor binding domains: PRD IV (grey), PRD III (yellow), PRD I (green), and PRD II (light blue). The unshaded nucleotides denote differences in the bovine IFN-\u03b2 promoter relative to the human promoter. The TATA box is highlighted in pink.
