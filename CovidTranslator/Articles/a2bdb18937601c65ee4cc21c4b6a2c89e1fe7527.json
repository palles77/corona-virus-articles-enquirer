To develop new physiologically active polysaccharides from CSL, polysaccharides were isolated and their innate immunostimulatory and anti-metastatic activities were investigated. Corn byproduct polysaccharides (CBP) were preferentially isolated from CSL and further separated into supernatant (CBP1S) and precipitate (CBP1P) fractions. The anti-complementary activity of CBP1S was more potent than CBP1P and CBP. In addition, CBP1S enhanced production of macrophage-stimulating cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and IL-12) and natural killer (NK) cell-activating substances (e.g., granzyme and interferon-\u03b3). Further, CBP1S significantly inhibited lung metastasis at a dose of 1000 \u03bcg per mouse in an experimental lung metastasis model. These results suggest that CBP1S seems to promote the inhibition of lung metastasis through a mechanism leading to stimulation of the innate immune system, and CBP1S could be used as immunostimulating agents and for industrial applications.",

Among them, the production of starch from corn has great advantages, attributable to its cultivation superiority, relatively large grains, and ability to be stored for long periods (Serna-Saldivar, 2016) . For these reasons, corn starch accounts for fifty percent of the total starch production. Industrial starch is used in 53.1% of the food industry (e.g., foods and beverages) and 37.8% of non-food industries (e.g., plastic or detergent industries 10.4%, paper industry 16.3%, and fermentation products 11.1%). Industrial applications that use starch are expected to continue to increase, and as a result, worldwide starch consumption is expected to increase from approximately 68 million-ton in 2010 to 89 million-ton in 2018 (31.1% increase) (Global Strategic Business Report, 2012) .",

Until recently, CSL was primarily discarded in the ocean as a major byproduct of corn starch production process. However, like other countries, as pf 2016, Korean laws prohibit the disposal of CSL in the water; consequently, CSL disposal is becoming a significant problem in Korea. It is well known that CSL contains various organic compounds, including polysaccharides, organic acids and vitamins as carbon sources, and amino acids and proteins as nitrogen sources) (Hull, Yang, Venzke, Kulhavy, & Montgomery, 1996; Liggett & Koffler, 1948) . Although various studies of the industrial applications of the organic compounds have been conducted, most of these studies have examined these compounds for use in growth or synthesis media for microorganisms (Maddipati, Atiyeh, Bellmer, & Huhnke, 2011; Utrilla et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014; Xi et al., 2013) . Moreover, there have been few studies involving the application of CSL as a functional food or therapeutic agent for the promotion of health.",

The fractions, termed CBP1S and CBP1P, yielded 4.0% and 6.8%, and estimated as 80 kDa and 4 kD, indicated respectively (Fig. 1) . In relation to the extraction yield of carbohydrate from CSL, Hull, Yang, Venzke, Kulhavy, & Montgomery (1996) reported that total carbohydrate contents was varied (5.6-17.2 g/L) according to the steaming condition of corn steep, and Prasanth, Hasan, Danielle, & Raymond (2011) reported that CSL included 7.5% total carbohydrate. Both polysaccharide fractions consisted primarily of neutral sugars (81-82%), as determined by chemical composition analysis (Table 1) . However, the characteristics of CBP1S and CBP1P were distinguished by the concentration of uronic acid and protein. That is, CBP1P contained 17.7% protein and minimal uronic acid. In contrast, CBP1S1 contained 9.5% uronic acid and an equivalent concentration of protein. Ethanol fractionation of crude polysaccharides results in separation of the polysaccharides by molecular size (Lee et al., 2015) , therefore, our results indicate that CBP1S, the polysaccharide fraction isolated from CSL that contains molecules of relatively small molecular, seems to be an uronic acid-involving polysaccharide.",

            "text": "The GC chromatograms of alditol acetate derivative prepared from CBP1S and CBP1P was presented in Supplementary Fig. S1 , and the results were summarized in Table 1 . Monosaccharide composition analysis revealed that CBP1P consists primarily of glucose units that are most likely glucan-like polysaccharides such as \u03b1-glucan (starch) or \u03b2glucan. In contrast, CBP1S comprised glucose, arabinose, and xylose residues (33.5%, 22.3%, and 14.3%, respectively). The high percentage of arabinose and xylose in CBP1S suggests that it is rich in arabinoxylan, which is a major hemicellulosic polysaccharide present in grass plants, including corn (Ebringerov\u00e1, Hrom\u00e1dkov\u00e1, & Heinze, 2005) . Hull et al. (1996) reported changes in the composition of corn steep water during steeping, with arabinose, xylose, and/or glucose as the major polysaccharide units in the corn steep water; their results are similar to the monosaccharide composition of CBP1S reported here. Excluding above reports, to our knowledge, few studies on the sugar composition analysis of CSL have reported so far. In addition, CBP1S fraction was analyzed using GC-MS following a methylation procedure to deduce the glycosidic linkage conformation of immunostimulating polysaccharide in CSL (Table 2) . CBP1S contains over than twenty types of glycosyl linkages, consisting primarily of xylopyranosyl (Xylp), arabinofuranosyl (Araf), glucopyranosyl (Glcp) and galactopyranosyl (Galp) linkages, in addition to a small amount of rhamnopyranosyl (Rhap) linkages. Large amount of Xylp linkages (26.2 mol%) and Araf linkages (20.8 mol%) indicated that hemicelluosic polysaccharide arabinoxylan accounts for about half proportion of CBP1S. In addition, large proportion of branched Xylp (2,4linked, 3,4-linked, and 2,3,4-linked; total of 16.8 mol%) in addition to reducing terminal Araf (15.8 mol%) assumed that (1 \u2192 4)-xylan backbone present in CBP1S arabinoxylan was highly substituted with short Araf residues. The 4-linked Glcp (11.4 mol%) and terminal Glcp (3.6 mol%) accounted for a major portion of Glcp linkages, suggesting that starch and cellulose might be contained in CBP1S with a small amount (about 15% of CBP1S). Meanwhile, various types of Galp linkages in addition to small amount Rhap linkage suggested that CBP1S is likely to contain several side chains of pectic rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I). That is, Rhap residue of RG-I is usaually substituted with single neutral glycosyl residues and with polymeric side chains consisting predominantly of \u03b1-L-(1 \u2192 5)-arabinans, \u03b2-(1 \u2192 4)-D-galactans, type I arabinogalactans, type II arabinogalactans, and possibly galacto-arabinans. Consequently, sugar composition and glycosidic linkage analyses indicated that three kinds of polysaccharide coexist in CBP1S, including a large proportion of arabinoxylan (about 50%), linear (1 \u2192 4)-glucan such as starch and cellulose, and side chains branched with Rhap residue of RG-I backbone.",

The measurement of complementary activity was based on the theory that depletion of complement components in human blood can be detected by measuring the overall hemolytic activity (Strong, Lea, & Ward, 1978) . Therefore, NHS was cultured with samples (complement activator), and the remaining complement titer was measured by hemolysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes as an antigen-antibody complex. The regulating samples for the hemolytic activity of complement are referred to as 'anti-complementary substances\" (Strong et al., 1978) . In this study, deionized water and PSK were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, and complementary activity was calculated as inhibition of 50% TCH (ITCH 50 ). PSK is a protein-bound polysaccharide isolated from the fruit body of mushrooms, such as Trametes versicol and Coriolus versicolor, which has been the subject of investigation as an experimental adjunctive therapy for various types of cancer (Koji et al., 2007) . It is well known a proteoglycan consisting mainly of common fungal \u03b2glucan being comprised of \u03b2-1,4 backbone with \u03b2-1,3 and \u03b2-1,6 side chains. The approximate molecular weight of PSK is 100 kDa, and the protein component is reported at the side chain of \u03b2-1,6 glycosidic bond (Hiroshi, Kenichi, & Yoshiharu, 1995) . When we estimated the complementary activity of CBP isolated from CSL and its two fractions (CBP1P and CBP1S), CBP1S showed the highest anti-complementary activity among the three polysaccharides ( Fig. 2A) . In the results of the relationship between dose and activity of the most active polysaccharide fraction, the significant anti-complementary activity of CBP1S was concentration-dependent (Fig. 2B) . Therefore, we used CBP1S as the immunostimulating polysaccharide fraction in all subsequent experiments.",

Macrophages belonging to the innate immune system can work as antigen-presenting cells following capturing bacteria and virus, etc, by phagolytic activity. Simultaneously, macrophage secretes various cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 to activate subsequent immune system functions (Beutler, 2004) . Ultimately, these macrophage-produced cytokines play a pivotal role in the communication between the innate and adaptive immune systems as part of the host defense mechanisms (Aderem and Underhill, 1999) . CBP1S increased the production of all cytokines tested (IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1) in murine peritoneal macrophage in a dose-dependent manner, ranging from 1 to 100 \u03bcg/mL (Fig. 3) . However, at a dose of 1000 \u03bcg/mL CBP 1S, cytokine production was significantly lower than that observed at a dose of 100 \u03bcg/mL.",

Therefore, we aimed to determine whether CBP1S facilitates NK cell activation. NK cells were isolated from the spleen of CBP1S-injected mice and cocultured with MHC class I-deficient Yac-1 lymphoma cells. NK cells recognize MHC class I bound in the cellular membrane of target cells to distinguish between self and non-self. If MHC class I is not recognized, perforins and granzymes are secreted to pierce the cell membrane and to degrade the MHC class I-deficient tumor or infected cells (Terunuma, Deng, Dewan, Fujimoto, & Yamamoto, 2008; Vivier et al., 2011; Voskoboinik, Whisstock, & Trapani, 2015) .

According to the above results, CBP1S might be beneficial for facilitating the innate immune system via activation of the complementary system, macrophages and NK cells. In particular, our results reveal that intravenous administration of CBP1S is useful for activating NK cells. Many of the previously reported studies of CSL were in vitro or used injections of the active polysaccharides, with no further oral administration (Pang, Xie, Chen, & Hu, 2012) . In addition, it is not clear whether polysaccharides that elicit biological activities in vitro or upon injection are effective when administered orally (Boh, Berovic, Zhang, & Zhi-Bin, 2007) . Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the anti-metastatic effects of CBP1S after oral administration. As such, CBP1S was constantly taken orally to mice for 15 days (twice per day). The effects of orally administered CBP1S on tumor metastasis were evaluated based on the number of tumor colonies after inoculating Colon26-M3.1 carcinoma cells, which can metastasize to the lungs in Balb/c mice (Sakamoto et al., 2003) . The results indicate that oral administration of CBP1S with a high dose (1000 \u03bcg per mouse) inhibits tumor metastasis significantly more than CBP1S administered at lower doses (Fig. 5) . Lung tumor generation was 37% lower in the group administered 1000 \u03bcg CBP1S than that of the NC group administered saline only. Consequently, our results suggest that oral administration of CBP1S could facilitates the anticancer effects, as shown by suppression of tumor migration to the target organ; these effects are likely related to stimulation of the innate immune system, such as the complement system, macrophages and NK cells.",

Therefore, CBP1S and CBP1P were isolated from CSL, and various immunological activities were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, CBP1S primarily comprises highly branched-arabinoxylan-rich polysaccharides with potent innate immune system-stimulatory activities. In addition, our results suggest that CBP1S seems to promote inhibition of lung metastasis through a mechanism leading to stimulation of the innate immune system. Overall, CBP1S shows potential for use in industrial application. On the other hand, the elucidation of molecular target of CBP1S is very important aspect of understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in immune responses (Kim, Hong, & Shin, 2017) . In the present study, potent anti-metastatic effect induced by stimulation of CBP1S was closely associated with the activation of immune cells. In fact, it is well known that activation of immune cells Anticomplementary activity was represented as the inhibition of 50% total complementary hemolysis.
