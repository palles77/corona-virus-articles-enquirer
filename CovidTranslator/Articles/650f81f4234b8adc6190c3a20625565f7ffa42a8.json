In this paper we apply a linguistic method -exhaustive ngram analysis -to already annotated islands in an attempt to characterize GIs more precisely than proved possible using earlier techniques, and to understand their structure better. We illustrate the method on the Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933 genome, a member of genus Escherichia of Enterobacteriaceae phylum and a well known and important experimental, medical and biotechnological organism [3, 5] .",

Section 2 surveys different methods and algorithms for identification and prediction of GIs, including the n-gram technique and its applicability to characterization of different types of texts. It also outlines the authors' prior work in the field. Section 3 describes the three steps of the GI characterization procedure. We first perform n-gram statistical analysis of islands, for different n, in order to classify them according to (dis)agreement with the complete genome. Next, we apply other compositional features (G + C content, CU) to islands and calculate statistical measures-recall, precision, sensitivity and specificity for the results of n-gram classification so as to examine how the n-gram feature contributes to characterizing GIs. Then we identify significantly overrepresented and underrepresented n-grams based on the maximal order Markov model, which may be used as a basis for Zipf-like analysis and for classification of islands based on such n-grams [6] . Section 4 presents computational results obtained for the E. coli EDL 933 genome. In Section 5 we offer our conclusions and outline some future plans.",

The sequence may be a message in a natural or artificial language, a discrete approximation of a continuous signal, e.g., speech, or any sequence of symbols generated by a stochastic process. Any such \"text\" can be approximated by the set of n-gram statistical data (e.g. frequency distribution and the respective mean and standard deviation), and two such texts may be compared based on the distance of such approximations. n-Grams of length 2, 3 and 4 are usually called bigrams, trigrams and tetragrams, respectively, and for higher values of n-simply n-grams. Formally, as defined in Vinga and Almeida [8] , a sequence X of length k is a linear succession of k symbols from a finite alphabet, A, of cardinality |A| = r. A segment of n consecutive symbols from the sequence X (n \u2264 k) is an n-gram (n-tuple, n-word, n-plet, n-mer) of the sequence X. There are L = r n different n-grams over the alphabet A, {w 1 , w 2 , . . . w L }. There are k \u2212 n + 1 overlapping n-grams in the sequence X. Some authors use n-grams in a broader sense not assuming contingency of symbols but a distance of a given length between them (spacer).",

Statistical distribution of the number of n-gram matches between two random sequences was analyzed by Karlin [37] and Lippert et al. [38] . Three asymptotic distributions were identified including compound Poisson, normal and uniform distribution. Radomski and Slonimski [39] recently proposed a method of representing and analyzing complete genome sequences, based upon the frequencies of amino acid bigrams at distance.

King and Guda [48] presented an n-gram-based Bayesian classifier that predicts the localization of a protein sequence. The classification accuracy of n-gram composition metrics was reviewed by Vinga and Almeida [8, 49] , together with a new definition of distance between protein sequences. Volkovich et al. [50] applied n-grams to the classification of DNA sequences considered as text over the four-letter alphabet {A, C, G, T}. Kirzhner et al.

Since both approaches may generate false positives and false negatives due to different factors [2] , combining the results of multiple techniques may be beneficial in determining whether a gene or a group of genes has been acquired by HGT. The functional, compositional, or combined approaches, resulted in a number of algorithms for GI/PAIs identification and prediction, and in several databases of predicted islands in bacterial and acrchaeal genomes, such as-IslandPath [59] , Islander [60] , Score-based Identification of Genomic Islands (SIGI) [61] and Pathogenicity Island DataBase (PAIDB) [62, 63] . IslandPath [59] incorporates both DNA sequence signal features (G + C frequency, dinucleotide bias) and annotation features (the presence of tRNA or rRNA, transposase or integrase genes) to aid the identification of GIs. Islander [60] coordinates several pre-existing computer programs and consists of 11 steps including tRNA (tmRNA) and integrase gene identification and then their passage through several filters sequentially. In SIGI procedure [61] , a scoring scheme on codon frequencies is applied and clusters of genes significantly deviating from species-specific value were predicted as GIs. In PAI DB [62, 63] , PAIs (which are a subgroup of GIs) are detected by combining sequence similarities (ORFs, RNA genes and repeat regions) and abnormalities in genomic composition (G + C frequency and CU).",

There is a 4001 bp long sequence of \"N\"s (unspecified nucleotides) in the genome (positions 1,725,749-1,729,749) and 6,641 incompletely specified nucleotides. There are 177 islands, designated as O-islands (OIs) with the total sum of length 1,278,307 bp. The backbone has a length of 4,250,138 bp. There are 4832 incompletely specified nucleotides in all the OIs. Approximately 26% of the E. coli EDL933 genes (1387/5416) lie completely within OIs, consisting mainly of phage or phage related sequences, and genes that may contribute to pathogenesis (i.e., PAI-like sequences), while others may confer strain-specific abilities to survive in different niches, or represent neutral variation between strains [5, 64] . Nine of the OIs (larger than 0.15 kilo base (kb)) encode for at least one large PAI (OI #148), and putative virulence factors having no obvious role in virulence [5, 64] . The two longest OIs, #43 and #48, are almost identical in length and nucleotide content. The OI #28, although 25,164 bp long, codes for four proteins, one of them being 5,189 amino acids in length (i.e., 15,567 bp; it is the longest protein, putative RTX family exoprotein). The 4001 bp long \"N\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7N\" sequence is contained in the OI #52 [5, 64] .",

The original Zipf power law was designed for word (i.e., motif) occurrences in any kind of text, stating that the most frequent word is expected to be twice as frequent as the following most frequent word, etc. The modification applied concerns the relationship between the most overrepresented n-grams (for specific n, according to the z M statistic) in a specific sequence and their usage in all the other sequences considered. First, n-grams (for specific n) were sorted in descending order of z-bias in a chosen OI (or the complete genome), and then MS Excel charts were used to represent the z-values of the sorted n-grams in the chosen sequence and in all the other sequences (OIs, complete genome, backbone). The procedure was repeated for each OI. It may suggest that some of the n-grams are overrepresented in a subset of OIs and underrepresented in the backbone, or vice versa, thus characterizing the subset of OIs. We identified such n-grams for the corresponding subsets of OIs.",

The corresponding figures for all the OIs from the 5DC class are given in Fig. 1AF1 in the additional file. It may be noticed that the most overrepresented and underrepresented tetragrams in the complete genome and its backbone are quite similar (as one would expect). Some of the most represented tetra First part of this table represents tetragrams which are among the most overrepresented in an OI (high z-value) while being among the most underrepresented in the backbone (low z-value); second part of this table represents tetragrams which are among the most underrepresented in an OI (low z-value) while being among the most overrepresented in the backbone (high z-value); third part of this table represents some of the tetragrams which are uniquely overrepresented in an OI and underreperesented in the backbone, while the fourth part represents some of the tetragrams which are uniquely underrepresented in an OI and overrepresented in the backbone. As expected, the first and the third part of the table have tetragrams in common, as well as the second and the fourth part of the table. Restriction enzyme recognition sequences for some E. coli strains, as well as for other bacteria, are given when known. Restriction enzyme data are taken from Genscript.com [70] . A tetragram with its reverse complement is given in pair (xxxx/yyyy) when the tetragram (xxxx) corresponds to the \"OI#\" and \"z-value in OI\" data, while its complement (yyyy) corresponds to the \"Restriction enzymes\" data. grams in the complete genome are underrepresented in some of the OIs, e.g. CCAG (Fig. 2(1) ), but the most underrepresented tetragrams in the complete genome tend to be underrepresented in most of the OIs, too (Fig. 3) . As far as 5DC OIs are concerned, it can be noticed that some of the most overrepresented tetragrams in each of them are underrepresented in the backbone, and have z-values above the z-values of the corresponding tetragrams in all other sequences (e.g., CCAT, TGGA in the OI #28, Fig. 2 (2), ATGC in the OI #51, Fig. 2(3) ). The same holds true for the most underrepresented tetragrams (e.g., CTTC in the OI #51, Fig. 2(6) ). Such tetragrams may be used as a basis for defining the OIs tetragram nucleotide signature. Tables 4a and 4b represent all the tetragrams that are overrepresented/underrepresented, respectively, in just one of the 5DC OIs and, at the same time, underrepresented/overrepresented, respectively, in the backbone, along with the z-value and rank of the tetragram in both sequences. Fig. 4 represents z-values for the most underrepresented tetragram in each of the 5DC OIs, which is overrepresented in the backbone, along the E. coli EDL933 genome.",

The present investigations add n-grams as an additional feature refining characterization of OIs, classifying, and distinguishing them by classification from the backbone sequences. Structurally different classes of OIs may have different functional interpretations. Unusual n-gram content may identify additional OIs with unusual composition and thus potential candidates for PAIs. This feature may also complement criteria for predicting various island sequences in genomes where they have not yet been annotated. Our future plans include computational experiments applying the proposed method to the island sequences of other bacterial species, in order to verify their characterization findings. We also plan to experiment with other types of motifs, such as repeats, as sequence characterization and classification features.",
