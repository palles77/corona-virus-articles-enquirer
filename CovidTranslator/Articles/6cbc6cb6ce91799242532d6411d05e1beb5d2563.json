We have analyzed the impact of HBoV in outpatients and in patients requiring hospitalisation or emergency attention for acute respiratory infections. Respiratory viruses were investigated by real-time PCR, direct antigen detection and/or viral culture by shell-vial assay. Nasopharyngeal aspirates, BAL and/or sputum samples from patients attended at a reference hospital, and nasal/throat swabs from outpatients were used. Respiratory viruses were detected in 660 samples (47%). HBoV detection rate was 12.6%, only preceded by respiratory syncytial virus (25%). Co-detections were observed in 12.9% of samples, and HBoV was present in 81% of them. Similar detection rates of HBoV were obtained in individuals with positive and negative results for other respiratory viruses (12.5% and 12.7%, respectively). The crossing point value was taken as a measure of HBoV viral load. Higher HBoV loads were observed in children, and in patients from the hospital. HBoV viral load was not associated with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection or lower respiratory tract disease. Although HBoV is frequently detected in respiratory specimens, there is a poor association between HBoV-positive specimens and clinical parameters. A clinical impact of HBoV in respiratory infection probably occurs in few cases.",

HBoV was first detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) [1] . Recently, it has also been identified in blood and in fecal samples from patients with gastroenteritis [2, 7, 20, 25] . However, the role of HBoV in human infectious disease is unclear due to the frequent detection of this virus in association with other respiratory viruses (RV) with a recognized pathogenic role in ARI. Indeed, like other members of the family (e.g. Parvovirus B19), HBoV can be shed asymptomatically during a prolonged period [23] . Some studies have suggested that the determination of HBoV load in respiratory specimens could be useful for clarifying the role of HBoV in acute respiratory infections (ARI) [7, 23] .",

Firstly, we excluded the presence of HBoV to divide the study population in two groups. One group comprehended cases positive for non-HBoV viruses (n = 552) and the other group included cases negative for non-HoV viruses (n = 848). Subsequently, HBoV detection rate was calculated in both groups. HBoV was detected in 69 (12.5%) and 108 cases (12.7%) of cases positive and negative for non-HBoV viruses, respectively (P = 0.935). Similarly, other three different analyses were carried out with the most frequently detected viruses, i.e. RSV, hMPV and FLU. The presence of RSV, hMPV and FLU was independently compared in two population groups in each analysis: cases positive for non-RSV and negative for non-RSV viruses, cases positive for non-hMPV and negative for non-hMPV viruses, and cases positive for non-FLU viruses and negative for non-FLU viruses, respectively. Contrarily to the results obtained with HBoV, significant differences between both groups were observed in each analysis. RSV was detected in 8.3% and 21.4% of cases positive and negative for non-RSV viruses, respectively (P \\ 0.001); hMPV was detected in 3% and 7% of cases positive and negative for non-hMPV viruses, respectively (P = 0.002); and, FLU was detected in 6,7% and 15.5% of cases positive and negative for non-FLU viruses, respectively (P \\ 0.001).",

Routine investigation of these viruses included antigen detection and/or viral culture by SV. Our detection rate of these RV in HP is lower than the reported in other studies [3] . The methodology may have contributed to this difference. Many virologists are currently using molecular assays for RV detection, which are more sensitive than cell culture. Indeed, molecular assays have allowed the detection of newly-identified RV that do not grow or grow poorly in cell culture, some of which have well-defined etiologic roles in respiratory tract infection, as occurs with hMPV. These methods have led to frequent co-detections [10] . For this reason, PCR methods for diagnosis of ARI may sometimes provide limited value to the information that the virologist gives to the clinician. As occurs with other RV, HBoV might be asymptomatically shed into the respiratory tract during a prolonged time [23] . Thus, a HBoV-positive result cannot not probably give the same information as the detection of other viruses such as RSV, hMPV and FLU in terms of clinical significance. Our results demonstrated that HBoV detection was independent of the presence of other respiratory virus, since the same detection rates of HBoV were observed in cases with and without other virus. And contrarily, respiratory viruses such as hMPV, RSV and FLU, recognized as causal agents of ARI were detected more frequently alone than with other virus. Other previous studies have compared the presence of HBoV in patients with ARI and control groups [7, 11, 26] . In one study [26] , high HBoV detection rates were detected in children \\1 year though no significant differences were observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. In another study, HBoV was detected in children with pneumonia, but this clinical finding was associated more probable to codetection of other viruses [7] . Finally, Kesebir et al. [11] , detected HBoV in patients with ARI and negative for RSV, FLU, PIV and ADV, compared to asymptomatic individuals. However, HBoV was investigated by PCR and the other viruses, by direct fluorescence assay; thus, these viruses could have been underdiagnosed because a less sensitive detection method was employed by the authors.",
