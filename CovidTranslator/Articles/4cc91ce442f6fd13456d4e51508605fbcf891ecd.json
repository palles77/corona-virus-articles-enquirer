However, crude case fatality ratios (CFRs) obtained from dividing deaths by cases can be misleading 9,10 . Firstly, there can be a period of two to three weeks between a case developing symptoms, subsequently being detected and reported and observing the final clinical outcome. During a growing epidemic the final clinical outcome of most of the reported cases is typically unknown. Simply dividing the cumulative reported number of deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases will therefore underestimate the true CFR early in an epidemic 9-11 . This effect was observed in past epidemics of respiratory pathogensincluding SARS 12 and H1N1 9 influenza -and as such is widely recognised. Thus, many of the estimates of the CFR that have been obtained to date for COVID-19 correct for this effect [13] [14] [15] [16] . Additionally, however, during the exponentially growing phase of an epidemic, the observed time-lags between the onset of symptoms and outcome (recovery or death) are censored and na\u00efve estimates of the observed times from symptoms onset to outcome provide biased estimates of the actual distributions. Ignoring this effect tends to bias the estimated CFR downwards during the early growth phase of an epidemic.",

Estimates of the CFR may thus be biased upwards until the extent of clinically milder disease is determined 9 . Data from the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan, China have primarily been detected through hospital surveillance and hence are likely to represent moderate or severe illness, with atypical pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress being used to define suspected cases eligible for testing 7 . In these individuals, clinical outcomes are likely to be more severe, and therefore any estimates of the CFR will be higher. Elsewhere in mainland China and outside, countries and administrative regions alert to the risk of infection being imported via travel initially instituted surveillance for COVID-19 with a broader set of clinical criteria for defining a suspected case. These typically include a combination of symptoms (e.g. cough and fever) combined with recent travel history to the affected region (Wuhan and/or Hubei Province) 2, 17 . Such surveillance is therefore likely to detect clinically milder cases but, by initially restricting testing to those with a travel history or link, may have missed other symptomatic cases. More recently, as epidemics have taken off in other countries, cases are now being detected in those with no reported travel links to Wuhan/Hubei province through broader surveillance systems. Some of these cases may represent a milder level of severity -including secondary cases identified via contact-tracing or those identified through sentinel surveillance of influenza-like-illness at primary care 18, 19 . In contrast, others will represent the severe end of the disease spectrum with an increasing number identified through hospital surveillance (for example, testing of viral pneumonia) or in a few cases, at post-mortem analysis.",

Using the age-distribution of the population, for a given attack rate, we therefore obtained an estimate of the expected infections in each age-group. Underascertainment was then estimated inside and outside Wuhan by comparing observed cases by age to this expected distribution assuming perfect ascertainment in the 50-59 age-group. For Wuhan, we added an additional scaling (fitted using a Binomial likelihood) to account for further underascertainment compared to outside Wuhan (given the over-stretched health system).

A large proportion of the cases, including all of those early in the epidemic, were reported from Wuhan where the local health system was quickly overwhelmed. Furthermore, the case definition outside Wuhan required a travel-link to Wuhan. Figure 3A shows a difference in the resulting agedistribution of cases reported from these two areas. Reported cases in Wuhan are more frequent in older age-groups, perhaps reflecting higher severity (and hence prioritisation for hospitalisation in Wuhan) whilst cases outside Wuhan may also represent a bias in terms of the relationship between age and travel. Adjusting for differences in underlying demography and assuming no overall difference in the attack rate by age, we estimate a high level of under-ascertainment of cases in younger agegroups in both Wuhan and outside Wuhan (Figure 3 C-D). Furthermore, we estimate a higher level of under-ascertainment overall in Wuhan compared to outside Wuhan ( Figure 3C ). Accounting for this under-ascertainment, we estimate the highest CFR in the 80+ age-group of 13.4% (11.2-15.9%) ( Figure  3B , Table 1 ). Our estimates of CFR decline rapidly with decreasing age, with very low rates in young adults and children.",

The principle reason for this is that the crude estimate does not take into account the severity of cases. Various estimates have been made from patient populations ranging from those with generally milder symptoms (for example international travellers detected through screening of travel history 13,32 ) through to those identified in the hospital setting 14,15,33 . We expect higher CFRs in those that are more severely ill. Many case reports note that the presence of other underlying conditions result in poorer prognosis. Although we were unable to adjust for this effect in the absence of detailed individual-level data, this is likely to be correlated with age. However, it should also be noted that the distribution of underlying conditions will vary geographically, and particularly between high-, middle-and low-income settings.",

Our results suggest a very low fatality ratio in those under the age of 20. However, as there are very few cases in this age-group, it remains unclear whether this reflects a low risk of death or a difference in susceptibility. Serological testing in this age-group will therefore be critical in the coming weeks to understand the significance of this age-group in driving population transmission. There is a clear increase in the estimated CFR from the age of 50 upwards, with this proportion rising from approximately 1% in the 50-59 age-group to 13% in those aged 80 and above. This increase in severity with age is clearly reflected in case-reports in which the mean age tends to be in the range 50-60 years. Different surveillance systems will pick up a different age-case-mix and we find that those with milder symptoms detected through history of travel are younger on average than those detected through hospital surveillance. Our correction for this surveillance bias therefore allows us to obtain estimates that can be applied to different case-mixes and demographic population structures. However, it should be noted that this correction is applicable under the assumption of a uniform infection attack rate (i.e. exposure) across the population.",

This underascertainment is the main factor driving the difference between our estimate of the crude CFR from China (3.67%) and our best estimate of the overall CFR (1.4%). Furthermore, the CFR is likely to be strongly influenced by the availability of healthcare.

Many more cases are likely to be symptomatic (fever/cough/myalgia) but may not require hospitalisation.

To capture this information, accounting for our estimates of the underlying surveillance capacity to capture all cases throughout the epidemic, we therefore assume that the current crude CFR in mainland China (i.e. current total deaths as a proportion of the current total observed cases) is a good estimate of the expected deaths arising from cases up to time in China as a proportion of the unadjusted observed cases in this time period:where is the total observed cases in China prior to time (which is 11 th February 2020).",
