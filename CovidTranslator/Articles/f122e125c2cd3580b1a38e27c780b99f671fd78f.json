            "text": "Uveitis is a visually-debilitating disorder that affects up to 30% of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). To identify genetic susceptibility loci for uveitis in JIA, we conducted a genome-wide association study comparing 192 JIA-associated uveitis cases with 330 JIA individuals without uveitis. Two cohorts of JIA patients underwent genotyping and quality control. We used an HLA-specific imputation panel to impute HLA-specific amino acids and HLA types, and identified the amino acid serine at position 11 (serine-11) in HLA-DRB1 as associated to increased risk of uveitis (OR = 2.60, p = 5.43 x 10 -10 ). The signal at serine-11 was female-specific (interaction of sex and serine-11, p = 0.0096). Serine-11 resides in the YST-motif (positions 10-12) in the peptide binding groove of HLA-DRB1. Quantitative binding affinity predictions revealed peptide-binding preferences that distinguish HLA-DRB1 allotypes with the YST-motif. Our findings highlight a genetically distinct, sexually-dimorphic feature of JIA-associated uveitis.",

[7] [8] [9] Despite its severity, uveitis is typically insidious in onset and often becomes symptomatic only after irreversible damage has occurred. Consequently, rigorous ophthalmological screening of all JIA patients is required for early detection and treatment of uveitis associated with JIA. 10 Nonetheless, severe ocular complications may already be present at the time of a uveitis diagnosis. Several clinical factors are associated with increased uveitis risk: young age (<7 years old) at JIA onset; the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at JIA onset, and JIA category (oligoarticular and polyarticular rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative). [10] [11] [12] Sex is also considered a risk factor, though the available epidemiologic data is controversial. Female patients comprise the majority of JIA categories with uveitis, and are therefore observed somewhat more frequently (but only modestly so) in the overall JIA population. The extent to which biological risk for JIAassociated uveitis is sexually dimorphic, however, is not known. 12 Both JIA and JIA-associated uveitis (i.e., JIA-uveitis) are multifactorial autoimmune disorders; each has a strong, though not fully penetrant, genetic predisposition. 4, 13 Both conditions are complex and driven by biological and environmental factors. 4, 13 There have been no reports of observed Mendelian inheritance patterns of uveitis in JIA-affected families, 4 further indicating a complex trait architecture. Genome-wide association studies in JIA individuals (with and without uveitis) have revealed a number of loci associated to the disease, [14] [15] [16] including multiple independent loci in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) which collectively explain >20% of the phenotypic variation in broadly-defined JIA. 16 A number of HLA types have also been identified as increasing risk of JIA-associated uveitis compared to controls. 4, [17] [18] [19] However, genome-wide genetic markers that distinguish JIA without uveitis from JIA-associated uveitis remain elusive, and the exact disease mechanisms predisposing only a subgroup of children to developing uveitis are unknown. Due to the severity of uveitis and the complications surrounding its detection, biomarkers to predict the development of uveitis would help in early detection of the presence of JIAuveitis in high-risk children without frequent, extensive, and costly screenings for all JIA patients.",

All samples analysed here fall into the following International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) categories: (i) oligoarticular extended, (ii) oligoarticular persistent, and (iii) RF-negative polyarticular JIA. We analyzed the collective JIA-uveitis categories as one group to increase power, because these common categories of JIA are all particularly prone to uveitis and have recently been shown to be genetically highly similar in HLA associations. 20 To identify risk variants in a high-density set of polymorphisms, we performed two sets of imputation: one using a sequencing-based reference panel, to scan for risk-increasing alleles genome-wide; and a second, with an MHC-specific reference panel, to identify additional SNPs, amino acids, and HLA types that confer risk to disease. We identified serine (S) at position 11 in HLA-DRB1 as highly associated to increased risk of uveitis (odds ratio (OR) = 2.60 [95% CI: 1.92 -3.52], p = 5.46 x 10 -10 ). Sex-specific analysis revealed that the association at serine-11 in HLA-DRB1 was specific to females only (p females = 7.61 x 10 -10 , p males = 0.18). Quantitative prediction of peptide binding revealed that the presence of serine-11, which is located in the peptide-binding groove, affects overall peptide-binding preferences of common HLA-DRB1 allotypes.",

To test if a single HLA-DRB1 position 11 allele was driving the top association signal (as opposed to all possible alleles together, as modeled by the omnibus test), we conditioned the top association signal first on serine and then on aspartic acid at position 11, by including the dosages of the respective variant as an additional covariate in the logistic regression model (Figure 1 , Table 2, Supplementary Table 2 Table 2) . To further decipher the specific residue(s) driving the association in uveitis, we performed a series of likelihood ratio tests. In brief, a likelihood ratio test compares the fit of two models to the observed data and indicates which of the models, if either, best fits the data. We found that the S (or Y or T) amino acids best fit the data (p = 1.48 x 10 -10 , compared to a model containing only PCs and sex as independent variables). Including the S/G residue at position 13 as well as the YST motif only modestly improved the fit of the model (likelihood ratio test p = 0.043, compared to a model containing serine at position 11 only); neither the S nor G residues alone at position 13 improved the model (p = 0.70 for both tests).",

This association indicates that, though JIA with uveitis and JIA without uveitis share clinical features and genetic risk factors (and in particular, HLA-specific genetic risk factors 20 ) , there is genetic architecture specific to uveitis. 4, 42, 43 Specifically, we use conditional testing and likelihood ratio tests to show that the previously reported signals in JIA at position 13 is a distinct signal from the uveitis signal at position 11 in HLA-DRB1. These findings suggest that the two phenotypes are likely to have biological features and progressions that are partially distinct. 44 Association testing initially revealed either serine or aspartic acid at position 11 in HLA-DRB1 as the most-associated variant, a signal we determined was primarily driven by serine. However, the perfect linkage disequilibrium between serine, tyrosine (position 10), and threonine (position 12) makes it impossible to disentangle the three amino acids in a statistical framework; a subset of the amino acids, or all three (that is, the YST-motif) may be key to disease onset. Importantly, though all three residues are located at the bottom of the HLA-DRB1 peptide-binding groove, only serine-11 is positioned towards, and, thus most likely interacting with, binding peptide epitopes (Figure 2) . Previous work has identified serine-11 as the strongest risk factor in seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Some JIA patients, including those with uveitis, might be categorized as seronegative RA by the time they reach adulthood, and seronegative RA is considered to genetically mirror the uveitisprone JIA categories. 20 In contrast, serine-11 is highly protective against seropositive RA, a biologically distinct form of RA in which uveitis is not common (<1% of cases). 45, 46 Sex-specific analyses in the MHC further revealed the HLA-DRB1 signal was unique to female samples: the interaction of sex and the HLA-DRB1 serine-11 genotype was significant, and the association signal at serine-11 was entirely absent when the analysis was restricted to male samples only. The reduced number of cases (N = 56 male JIA-uveitis cases and N = 102 male non-uveitis JIA controls) and therefore reduced power in the maleonly analysis may explain the absence of a signal at serine-11. However, we had 98.5% power to detect an association of p < 0.05 at serine-11 in the male-only analysis, assuming the odds ratio in males was the same as in females (OR = 3.30). Assuming a more modest effect in males (OR = 2.00), we still had 75.2% power to detect a signal at p < 0.05. To detect potentially more subtle effects in males (OR < 2), larger case collections will be necessary to improve power. Nonetheless, the interaction test of sex and serine-11 provides compelling evidence for a sexually-dimorphic signal in HLA-DRB1.",

            "text": "In-depth data on sex-specific epidemiology of uveitis associated with JIA are sparse, however, the typical bilateral chronic anterior uveitis has been reported to occur more frequently in females. 37, 47 This genotype-by-sex interaction informs an exciting field of future research that aims to elucidate how the uveitis risk mechanisms underlying the HLA-DRB1 signal may be mediated by sex-specific factors, such as hormone regulation. Further, the sex-specific pattern of genetic association may help to resolve previously reported evidence of sexual dimorphism with respect to severity or disease course in children with JIA-associated uveitis. 48 Lastly, the finding indicates that sex stratification may be beneficial for future clinical trials, as some therapeutic agents may be more efficacious in females or males only. 49, 50 HLA-DR\u03b21, like other MHC class II molecules, is essential to immunity and orchestrates downstream immune responses by presenting a dynamic cargo of thousands of different peptides for scrutiny by T helper cells. 51 Both JIA and uveitis are considered diseases mediated by T helper cell subsets. 4 The strong association of an amino acid motif (tagged by serine-11) in HLA-DRB1 suggests that predetermined peptide preferences may affect the regulation of T helper cells. To investigate the immunological impact of the motif in HLA-DRB1, we used a \"reverse immunology\" approach 38 (Materials and Methods), performed using data from proteins experimentally observed in human iris. 52 Since JIA-uveitis patients frequently have circulating ANAs directed to iris tissues, we specifically focused on nuclear proteins to provide a disease-relevant dataset for modelling. Although the large panel of putative antigens that we tested was by no means exhaustive (Supplementary Table 4) , the experiment demonstrated that the presence of a serine-11 motif in HLA-DRB1 is accompanied by distinguished changes in binding affinity in the resulting protein (Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Figures 7) , suggesting that antigen presentation by the HLA-DR\u03b21 protein may underpin the uveitis susceptibility. Risk alleles of HLA-DRB1 that encode serine-11 (e.g. HLA-DRB1*11, Supplementary Table 2) may communicate distinct 'peptidomes' that influence T helper cells and significantly increase the likelihood of downstream immune responses (e.g., ANA) to the eye. Further, ANA-positivity is modestly correlated with presence of serine-11 in the cases studied here (Pearson's r= 0.26, P = 4.9 \u2715 10 -4 ). Functional studies using HLA-proteomic approaches will be necessary to experimentally validate and systematically dissect the complex downstream effects of serine-11 on tissue-specific antigen presentation by HLA-DR\u03b21 in uveitis.",

Given our sample size, we were well powered to detect common (frequency >10%) and highlypenetrant (odds ratio > 3, Supplementary Figure 9 ) variation that associates with increased uveitis risk compared to JIA individuals without uveitis. However, we are underpowered to identify common, modestly-penetrant variation -the hallmark genetic feature of complex phenotypes 62,63 -that may further distinguish the two phenotypes. In the current study, we included only patients for whom we were able to obtain detailed ophthalmological follow-up for \u2265 4 year (\u00b190% of uveitis develops within 4 years after onset). 64 While imperative to revealing the serine-11 association, this strategy limited case ascertainment. Future genetic studies will likely benefit from broader inclusion of cases, including essential, detailed phenotype information, 7,65 in order to identify additional genetic associations that are shared across or distinct to particular uveitis subtypes of gender. 66 In addition, clinical studies -including clinical trials -may be improved by being well-powered in both sexes to enable sex-specific investigations.",

A recent GWAS identified HLA-DRB1*1501 as a risk factor for uveitis, 67 and recent studies in JIA-associated uveitis point toward a role for infiltrated plasma cells 68 , T helper cells 4 , and changes in the ocular fluid microenvironment. 43, 69, 70 Future, larger genetic studies comparing JIA-uveitis and JIA without uveitis, with and without sex-specific analysis, will likely expand our understanding of uveitis pathogenesis in a number of ways. Broad case inclusion will elucidate whether subtype-specific architectures exist and larger samples will improve statistical power to identify more modest-effect disease-modifying variants both within and outside of the MHC. For example, this may substantiate the association of additional HLA alleles (such as HLA-DPB1) with uveitis in JIA (Figure 1) .",

Risk factors such as young age and presence of ANA, assumed to reflect aberrant immune activation, 37, 40, 64, 71 indicate patients potentially at higher risk of uveitis but are in no way predictive of disease outcome. An easily-testable biomarker such as a genotype would be highly impactful in the management of uveitis, as it would help in overcoming the challenge of detecting the insidious onset of disease 7, 48, 65 . Intriguingly, after deeper examination of the phenotypic data, we found that 99% of female uveitis cases in our study carry at least one copy of the variant coding for serine-11. The only female uveitis case who did not carry serine-11 in HLA-DRB1 appeared to suffer from ANA-negative oligoarthritis with mild vitritis and peripheral multifocal choroiditis in the absence of anterior segment inflammation; this ocular finding is atypical for JIA, and thus, according to our inclusion criteria, this sample was likely improperly included at cohort collection. Prospective studies in larger populations, including detailed clinical evaluation of development of uveitis and secondary uveitis phenotypes, will be necessary to dissect the potential of serine-11 or other genotypes as biomarkers for disease risk. Regardless, the current study justifies further genetic analysis as a potentially powerful instrument in moving analysis of the genetic architecture of uveitis towards accurate and efficient clinical decision tools.",

            "text": "Next, we tested the predicted affinities of all 83,686 overlapping 15-mer peptides from the selected 147 proteins in netMHCIIpan3.1. that tentatively could be presented by HLA-DR for binding to representative four-digit alleles of HLA-DRB1 (*01:01, *03:01, *04:01, *07:01, *08:01, *09:01, *10:01, *11:01, *12:01, *13:01, *14:01, *15:01, and *16:01). These alleles account for 79% of HLA-DR\u03b21 alleles in the JIA cases. The affinity data was log-transformed to a value between 0 and 1 using: 1\u2212log(IC 50 nM)/log(50,000). 38 To categorize HLA-DRB1 allotypes (alleles) with similar predicted binding preferences, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Heatmaps were created based on the Euclidean distance measure and the Ward's linkage method using the MetaboAnalyst server. 82 We computed the ratio of the average binding affinity of HLA-DR\u03b21 molecules that contain Serine-11 in the peptidebinding groove (*03:01, *08:01, *11:01, *12:01, *13:01, and *14:01) over the average binding affinity of HLA-DR\u03b21 proteins that have other amino acids at this position (*01:01, *04:01, *07:01, *09:01, *10:01, *15:01, and *16:01) as a measure for the overall difference in predicted binding affinity for each peptide. A frequency distribution of the ratio of the binding affinities was plotted for the entire set of peptides (including low and nonbinding peptides), potential ligands for DR\u03b21 with a binding affinity stronger than half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 500 nM, or peptides with high binding affinity for Serine-11 encoding alleles(IC 50 <50nM). correspond to presence of the given amino acid residue(s). Presence of serine (Ser) or aspartic acid (Asp) at position 11 in HLA-DRB1 (imputation info score = 1.11) was the top hit after initial association testing. Conditioning on either aspartic acid or serine revealed that the amino acids at positions 10-13, all well-imputed (imputation info = 1.08) and in perfect linkage disequilibrium, explain the bulk of the initial signal. Association statistics for tyrosine (position 10), threonine (position 12) and serine or glycine (position 13) are identical to the association statistics reported for serine (position 11) due to linkage disequilibrium. . The molecule is positioned to provide a view from the top of the peptide-binding groove. The beta-chain (DR\u00df) is highlighted in orange. Amino acid serine at position 11 (red) is located in the bottom center of the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DR\u00df1. Adjacent amino acid tyrosine at position 10 (green) and threonine at position 12 (blue) and serine at position 11 are displayed as spheres. 3D structure was produced using UCSF Chimera. 83 ",

The association at serine-11 in HLA-DRB1 was consistent in direction of effect and magnitude of association in both Phase 1 (OR = 2.15 [95% CI: 1.52 -3.05], p = 1.59 x 10 -5 ) and Phase 2 (OR = 3.34 [95% CI: 1.92 -5.83], p = 2.11 x 10 -5 ), indicating that both phases of the study contributed to the joint association signal 21 in the mega-analysis. Serine at position 11 in HLA-DRB1 is positioned in the middle of what is known as the YSTmotif 35,36 in HLA-DRB1; the motif is comprised of tyrosine (Y) at position 10, serine (S) at position 11, and threonine (T) at position 12. All three amino acids are in perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) with one another (i.e., LD = 1 between all residue pairs). Additionally, the residues in the YST-motif are also in perfect LD with a fourth residue, presence of serine (S) or glycine (G) at position 13 in HLA-DRB1 (OR = 2.47 [95% CI: 1.84 -3.32, p = 1.44 x 10 -9 in the MHC analysis).
