It is also a virus that can be transmitted to and, in some instances, between humans [1] with lethal consequences. To date, around 58% of humans infected to date with H5N1 have died [3] . Treatment for those infected is poor with the H5N1 strain often found to be resistant to antiviral medications traditionally used to treat influenza (i.e., amantadine, oseltamivir, and rimantidine) [1, 4] . While the peak incidence of avian influenza appears to have passed, confirmed human cases of H5N1 remain [5] and, as such, the potential for a more widespread H5N1 outbreak exists.",

While the demand for blood or blood products may decrease during a highrisk phase of an H5N1 outbreak (i.e., when human-to-human transmission is sustained), a baseline demand for blood and blood products will remain. To maintain a safe and secure blood supply, it is critical to understand how blood donors can be retained in such a situation [10] .

Intention is, in turn, derived from attitudes (perceived positive or negative evaluations of the behavior), subjective norms (perceived pressure from others to perform the behavior), and perceived behavioral control (perceived amount of control over behavioral performance; also believed to influence behavior directly) [11] . Underlying these determinants of intention are salient beliefs that individuals hold about the focal behavior [11] . Attitude is informed by behavioral beliefs (i.e., costs and benefits of behavioral performance). Subjective norm is informed by normative beliefs (i.e., important referents' approval or disapproval of behavioral performance). Perceived behavioral control is informed by control beliefs (i.e., barriers preventing and motivators encouraging behavioral performance). A number of studies have utilised the knowledge of these underlying beliefs to increase our understanding of donation behavior [12] and, more specifically, blood donor behavior [13] . No previous study has, however, documented the critical beliefs underlying blood donors' decisions to donate or not during an outbreak of avian influenza.",

After reading each article, participants were asked to list any advantages or disadvantages (behavioral beliefs) they believed would occur as a result of donating blood, individuals who would approve or disapprove of them donating blood (normative beliefs), and factors that may facilitate or inhibit their ability to donate blood (control beliefs) in the context depicted in the newspaper scenarios. Using content analysis, the most frequently occurring responses to each of the questions formed the basis for the development of the belief-based measures in the main study questionnaire (i.e., behavioral, normative, and control belief measures).",

To be eligible to participate in the survey, respondents were required to have donated blood within the last 6 months. Eligible participants reported a mean time since last donation of 3.12 months (SD = 2.01), and a range of 1-55 donations across their donor careers (Mean = 14.31, SD = 14.43).

Those donors with intentions toward donating blood in the specific scenario ranging from 1.00 to 5.99 were classified as having weaker intentions to donate, whereas those with intentions ranging from 6.00 to 7.00 were classified as having stronger intentions. In order to check that weak intenders had significantly lower intentions to donate blood across both scenarios than strong intenders an independent-groups t-test was performed. To compare the beliefs of donors with stronger intentions to donate blood (referred to as strong intenders) with those with weaker intentions to donate (referred to as weak intenders) in each of the scenarios, a series of one-way multivariate analyses of variances (MANOVAs) were conducted using Wilks' Lambda criteria to determine significance at p < 0.05. To explore where the differences exist between the groups, dependent variables (i.e., beliefs) were examined at the univariate level. Bonferonni adjustments were used to control for familywise type 1 error. Finally, regression analyses were undertaken to determine the critical beliefs that contribute to intention to donate in a low-and high-risk phase of a H5N1 pandemic.",

As such, and cognizant that donors are likely to simultaneously hold behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about donating during an outbreak of avian flu, additional correlation and regression analyses were undertaken to determine the strongest unique predictors of intention. In both phases, the majority of behavioral beliefs and all normative, and control beliefs were significantly correlated with intention (see Table 2 ), however, the behavioral belief of 'increase the risk of me inadvertently spreading the virus' was not significantly correlated with intention in the low-risk scenario. Inspection of the correlations between each of the beliefs also indicated that the large majority of beliefs were significantly correlated with each other. Given the large number of relationships between the beliefs and intention, and between each of the beliefs, a stepwise regression was conducted in order to determine the critical targets for an intervention [14] . Consistent with the approach taken by von Haeften and colleagues [14] all behavioral beliefs significantly correlated with intention were entered into a stepwise multiple regression to identify those that made an independent contribution to donors' intentions to donate during a low-risk and high-risk outbreak of avian influenza. The same approach was then taken to identify the key normative and control beliefs. In the final step of this analysis, all the beliefs that made a significant independent contribution to the prediction of intention were then entered into a final stepwise regression.",

When considering these beliefs in conjunction with normative and control beliefs, different target beliefs emerged for donors in the low and high-risk phases of an avian influenza outbreak. Specifically, in both the low-risk and high-risk phases the results suggest that emphasising the key belief that blood donation helps to ensure a sufficient blood supply would be beneficial.

In contrast, in the high-risk phase having explicit requests or appeals for blood donation should motivate donors to donate. While the results of the current study provide valuable information about the critical beliefs to target when formulating strategies to maintain blood donation behavior during an avian influenza outbreak or equivalent health scares, the findings should be interpreted in light of the study's limitations. Our sample comprised self-selected donors who were asked to consider their behavior in the context of a hypothetical low-risk and high-risk outbreak of avian influenza. To date, H5N1 influenza has not impacted on Australia and an avian influenza pandemic has not been declared anywhere in the world [18] . As such, the scenarios presented were hypothetical and could only be considered in abstract by our donors. However, the fact that different beliefs emerged as key targets for intervention at the different risk levels suggests that donors actively attempted to consider their donation behavior as a function of the different risk scenarios presented to them.",

The findings from the current study suggest that a differing emphasis on specific benefits and costs, the social approval of important others, and addressing (perceived) barriers to donation may assist in maintaining current donors' intentions and, thus, subsequent blood donation behavior during low and high-risk phases of an avian influenza outbreak.
