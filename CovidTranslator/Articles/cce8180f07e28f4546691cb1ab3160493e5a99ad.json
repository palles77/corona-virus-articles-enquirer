The name of the representation comes from another area of science due to form of the descriptors (numerical characteristics) representing these graphs. The sequence is represented by material-like points which are treated as rigid bodies as in the Newtonian dynamics. We have proposed several descriptors related to the 2D-dynamic graphs: centers of mass [8] , moments of inertia of the graphs [8] , moments of the mass-density distribution [33, 34] , angles between the x axis and the principal axis of inertia of the graphs [35] .

The moments of inertia are associated with the rotations about the principal axes. If the mass is concentrated close to the axis of rotation, the moment of inertia is small and it is easier to accelerate the spinning of the body. If the mass is dispersed, the moment of inertia is large and the acceleration of spinning is more difficult. Thus, these descriptors carry the information about the concentrations of masses around the axes. The location of the center of the mass of the 2D-dynamic graph depends on the number of particular bases in the sequence. Each base is represented by a 2D unit vector in the (x, y) plane: A = (\u22121,0), G = (1,0), C = (0,1), T = (0,\u22121). Since the graph is obtained using a method of walk in 2D space [8] the location of the graph depends on the relative number of particular bases. Thus, if for example, the number of A bases is larger than the number of G bases then the graph is shifted towards the negative x values by the appropriate amount.",

The descriptors have been used to the construction of the classification diagrams. Some examples of the 2D-dynamic graphs for the sequences under consideration are shown in Figs. 1, 2.  Figures 3, 4 show the classification diagrams based on the descriptors defined in Eq. 9 of the 2D-dynamic graphs. We observe that the descriptors corresponding to histone H4 coding sequences are located in different parts of the diagrams than the descriptors corresponding to alpha globin coding sequences. Each point corresponds to a different species (for details about histone H4 coding sequences see [1] and about alpha globin coding sequences see [8] ). . Squares correspond to histone H4 coding sequences and circles correspond to alpha globin coding sequences sequences of plants and of vertebrates we have already performed using moments of the mass-density distributions of the 2D-dynamic graphs [1] and using the descriptors of Four-Component Spectral Representation of DNA sequences [1, 32] .",

It is interesting, that the ideas brought from different The symbols are the same as in Fig. 3 areas of science can be mixed and, in effect, we can reveal various aspects of similarity of the DNA sequences. In particular, Four-Component Spectral Representation [9] only visually resembles molecular spectrum. Also 2D-dynamic graphs are not real dynamical objects. However, using methods and terminology from other fields one can obtain a convenient and intuitive classification tool of the DNA sequences. ",
