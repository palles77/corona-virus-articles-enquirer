During his 17-plus years with State, he has served in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. The opinions expressed in this article are his alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the U.S. government. Abstract: One of the most devastating shocks to global security imaginable is a pandemic. As history helps to demonstrate, this catastrophe and its reverberations could in today's world create a scene not unlike that depicted in the Book of Revelation, when the pale horse and its rider Death sow destruction \"with sword and with famine and with pestilence.\" To protect our own interests and security, it is imperative that the United States take preventive actions against a potential pandemic. This article argues that one important area for mitigation is climate change interacting with the growing urbanization of the world's population. These two factors combined promise massive shocks to global security, and because of the destructive potential, it is critical that U.S. national-security professionals consider this worst-case future when developing policies and strategies. If a large-scale pandemic does occur, as many scientists believe possible, are we prepared to handle it? Have we taken the actions necessary to mitigate the worst-case outcome? This article also argues that a lead actor in prevention efforts should be the U.S. military, which has the reach and resources that others do not.",

While some deny that climate change is happening or that humans have any mitigating role to play, 4 most reasonable people would concede that climate change poses real problems that must be addressed. 5 Regardless of one's skepticism on the matter of climate change, it is essential to consider its worst-case outcomes when developing U.S. security strategies and policies. As the Department of Defense (DoD) has reported to Congress, \"The effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to [DoD] missions, operational plans, and installations.\" 6 Of the projected negative effects of climate change, from severer storms to more extensive droughts, probably the threat with the most devastating potential is a pandemic. From disrupting trade to decimating populations, a pandemic could potentially cause more destruction than a nuclear strike; 7 thus, it is essential to understand how changing climate could unleash such destruction-with little to no advance warning-and how we can best manage the consequences.",

In addition, waterborne infectious diseases, such as cholera, will also likely increase due to poor sanitation caused by water scarcity in times of drought and by \"overwhelmed sewage lines or the contamination of water by livestock\" during times of flooding. 11 As an example of how bad a cholera epidemic can become, consider the recent outbreak in Yemen, which erupted in April 2017 and has since led to over one million suspected cases and over 2,500 deaths. 12 The ongoing civil war in Yemen and the resulting scarcity of water have exacerbated the epidemic. 13",

One especially tragic example is the \"Black Death\" of the mid-fourteenth century, which killed upwards of 75 million people in Europe and Asia and likely was caused by climatic changes that stimulated the growth of the rodent population. Certainly, this example involved a complex interaction of factors over an extended period of decades. A mild climate in eastern Kazakhstan and southwest China \"fostered plant-food abundance and hence wild rodent proliferation.\" As a subsequent cooling took place, \"plant growth declined\" and catastrophic floods \"displaced and drowned many people.\" The environmental changes \"likely also displaced wild rodents and increased rodent-human contact.\" At the same time, in western China \"encroaching nomadic Mongol pastoralists\" and \"Han Chinese farmers\" engaged in increased conflict, and this also displaced people and likely increased rodent-human contact. This chain of climatic effects could well have potentiated a deadly plague epidemic. \"Before long, trade caravans or (more probably) horse-borne Mongol armies, with 'companion' black rats, carried the disease westward 9 Shuman, \"Global Climate Change and Infectious Diseases.\" 10 into Europe . . . via the Black Sea port of Kaffa.\" Within ten years, Europe's population was decimated. 14 This pandemic starkly illustrates the dark side of fourteenth-century globalization. It demonstrates all too clearly that climate changes in one location can result in cascading effects that ripple around the world and eventually wreak havoc far removed from the source of initial disaster. Those forces were the same ones that we face today: natural disasters, migrations of people, conflict over scarce resources, and ultimately a pandemic transmitted around the world through trade and war. At present, with billions more people and modern means of transportation, it is clear the same situation today would be exponentially more disastrous. Lest one think that modern society is safer due to advanced technology and capabilities, consider that many experts believe the opposite: modern societies, though better resourced and more interconnected, are also more densely populated and infrastructure-dependent, and hence less flexible and more vulnerable to a sudden disastrous shock. 15",

This problem is exacerbated by the rapid development of megacities, defined as having a population in excess of 10 million. \"In 2017, developing nations boasted 26 megacities compared to seven in developed countries.\" 23 This trend toward expansion in developing countries is set to continue, especially in Africa. For example, Luanda, predicted to become a megacity by 2030, \"is expected to undergo a 60 percent increase in its population between 2017 and 2030, placing further strain on housing, transport, public utilities and sanitation.\" 24 One critical problem with the expanding urban landscape is that the growth is largely uncoordinated. Densely populated shanty towns and slums ring the edges of otherwise modern and ordered square blocks of skyscrapers and malls. 25 The uncontrolled development leads to increased human interaction with rats and other rodents, thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of zoonotic infectious diseases. 26 Also increasing the potential for zoonotic contagions is that the new populations push cities out into previously undisturbed ecosystems (e.g., adjacent deserts and forests), and as a result contact between animals and humans increases, generally in unsanitary environments. 27 The overcrowded conditions heighten the risk of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever. 28 Basic sanitation and water systems become overwhelmed, resulting in contaminated water supplies and increasing the potential for cholera and other water-borne diseases. 29 Diseases that were formerly confined to rural areas accompany the migrants into the new urban environment, where they have a much greater chance to thrive. 30 Security services are often unable to properly police the expanded slum areas, which can become lawless and less secure. In addition, where order has disappeared, other city services generally will not go. Most critically, existing healthcare services cannot properly serve the increased population. If a pandemic takes root in such an environment, chances are high that it will spread rapidly before it can be detected.",

As scholars Giovanna Kuele and Ana Cristina Miola have noted, \"Over the past decade climate change-related desertification has expanded in Somalia, greatly increasing the vulnerability of the local population.\" 32 This change has sharpened disputes over scarce water resources and has led to \"high rates of malnutrition, disease outbreaks, and food insecurity.\" Cholera epidemics have been recurrent in Somalia, the most recent one starting in late 2017, and thousands have died as a result. 33 With disease and violence rampant, over one million Somalis have been displaced; with Mogadishu in utter chaos, many of them have migrated to nearby Kenya, thus putting a strain on Kenya's resources. 34 In the Yemen cholera outbreak noted above, scientists have determined that the strain causing the outbreak \"came from Eastern Africa and entered Yemen with the migration of people in and out of the region.\" 35 Thus, it is likely that Somalia's dysfunction has contributed to Yemen's.

However, none of these agencies can match the global presence 39 and financial heft of DoD. This realization is especially true in the current political environment, as the Trump administration seems intent on cutting foreign assistance and health budgets while increasing DoD's.

While many nations voluntarily have signed onto international agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, few of these countries adhere to the agreed standards. 41 And, the agreed standards themselves have been called into question as not being sufficient. 42 In addition, some of the greatest contributors to pollution and environmental degradation flagrantly ignore climate concerns. 43 Indeed, both India and China, two of the biggest polluters in the world, were exempted from the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement contains no formal enforcement mechanisms-one of the glaring weaknesses of internationally engineered solutions to climate change. 44 At the recent climate gathering in Katowice, Poland, participants agreed to a new rulebook to improve the Paris Agreement; however, details of the \"rulebook\" are not clear, and key countries did not support the creation of a global carbon market, seen by many economists as the key to reducing carbon emissions worldwide. 45 The gathering appeared to promise more of the same: heavy polluters will continue to pollute, while certain developed countries will continue voluntarily to reduce emissions (or not). 46 This is not to say that international government organizations (IGOs) bring no benefit to the discussion. The United Nations and other IGOs serve a useful role in raising awareness, providing a forum for debate, and providing resources in some 41 David G. Victor, Keigo Akimoto, Yoichi Kaya, Mitsutsune Yamaguchi, Danny Cullenward, and Cameron Hepburn, \"Prove Paris was more than paper promises,\" Nature, Aug. 1, 2017, https://www.nature.com/news/prove-paris-was-more-than-paper-promises- cases. 47 For these reasons alone, the United States should stay actively involved in international efforts to combat climate change and ensure as much as possible that U.S. interests are promoted. However, a realist understands that due to the inefficiencies of international consensus-building, IGOs' actions generally will be longer-term solutions with slow and clumsy implementation. 48 As Divya Srikanth has written: \"Developed states are highly reluctant to voluntarily stunt their economic growth by adhering to the Kyoto Protocol, and developing states are unwilling to compromise on their new-found economic successes. This has led to a stalemate in terms of tackling the impact of climate change.\" 49 Though the stalemate shows no positive signs of breaking, due to the severity of the stakes involved, America cannot abdicate leadership in this long-term effort. At the same time, it must lead efforts to combat the near-term consequences of climate change.",

It is essential to expand partnerships with and support the World Health Organization (WHO), USAID, and others to add facilities, provide training, conduct services in the most vulnerable areas, and help cities better plan for expansion and a proper balance of interaction between humans, animals, and 80 Johns Hopkins, \"Technologies to Address Global Catastrophic Biological Risks,\" p. 5. 81 Sonia Shah, \"How Cities Shape Epidemics,\" The Atlantic, Feb. 25, 2016, https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/urbanization-pandemicexcerpt/470214/. 82 Neiderud, \"How urbanization affects the epidemiology or emerging infectious diseases,\" p. 3. \"Between 1990 and 2012, the group in urban settings which lacked sanitation actually significantly increased from 215 million to 756 million, which could be explained by population growth.\" 83 Based on this author's experience as Economic Officer in Iraq, the U.S. military Civil Affairs teams were better at enacting effective and pragmatic changes than were USAID and other non-military organizations. This author worked closely with Civil Affairs team members who had agriculture, finance, and engineering expertise and who effectively shared it with Iraqi government officials and business managers to bring about positive change. 84 Reyes et al., p. 127. 85 For a description of the program and ongoing projects, see, \"Pacific Environmental Security Forum,\" U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, http://pesforum.org/. delicate eco-systems. 86 As noted earlier, an effective partner could be China, whose focus on public infrastructure could be strengthened by America's traditional focus on policy reform and technical assistance in sectors such as healthcare. 87 The U.S. military should also upgrade its own capacity in line with the new threat environment. While we place a renewed focus on great-power competition with China and Russia and continue hedging against terrorism and other intermediate threats, we should also factor in human-security challenges such as pandemics. Our force structure should change to reflect this. For example, we should add more hospital ships and invest more heavily in health-related Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities, even if that means cutting warships. In addition to providing essential medical services, the hospital ships could be redesigned and updated to include extensive laboratory facilities and drone and AI platforms to assist with research, surveillance, and detection. 88 The drones could also be used to deliver medical supplies to hard-to-reach locations.",

            "text": "Some would argue that this change in force structure would cut against the grain of the National Defense Strategy's emphasis on traditional \"lethality\" 89 and its focus on great-power competition, 90 diverting money from much-needed warfighting capabilities. However, it is reasonable to argue that the American homeland and overall global security face a deadlier threat from a pandemic than from Chinese or Russian aggression. As an example, one should consider the Spanish flu that broke out in 1918, and by the spring of 1919, it \"had sickened an estimated one-third of the world's population and may have killed as many as 50 million people,\" 91 including approximately 675,000 Americans. 92 This black swan attacked a world completely unprepared for it, and its death toll was higher than that of the Great War that immediately preceded it. 93 A more recent example is the swine flu pandemic of 2012, which, according to CDC, killed an estimated 284,500 people. 94 Security against this kind of non-traditional threat involves a different kind of lethality, one in which we invest in capabilities that are designed to preempt and destroy contagions rather than people and infrastructure. Adding hospital and laboratory ships, and the associated drone and AI capabilities, would greatly improve our ability to provide medical services and research and surveillance support at the most at-risk locations. It would also demonstrate a positive U.S. presence to huge segments of the developing world's population. 95 From a budgetary perspective, consider that \"the cost to the global economy of SARS is estimated to have been $54 billion, according to the World Bank, while the organization estimates that a 'severe flu pandemic' could cost over $3 trillion, nearly five percent of global GDP.\" 96 Even if a newly designed hospital and laboratory ship carried a price tag of $2 billion or so, the potential of catastrophic loss from a pandemic dwarfs the investment in human security that would come with the procurement of a fleet of these ships. 97 When one considers that the majority of the world's growing urban population resides \"in a coastal zone or a zone with distinct coastal influence,\" 98 the argument to update the Navy's human-security capabilities becomes even more cogent.",

The alternative will be more Mogadishus, or worse. IGOs play an important role in encouraging international debate and in providing limited resources; however, to address the looming threat of deadly contagion, we must take aggressive and pragmatic action. Due to its reach and resources, the U.S. military is well-placed to lead. It should partner with governments and NGOs, leveraging existing alliances and building new ones.
