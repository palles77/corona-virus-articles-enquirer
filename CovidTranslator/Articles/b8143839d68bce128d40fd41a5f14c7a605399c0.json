Chloroquine is an inexpensive antimalarial drug that also exerts anti-HIV activity. The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize a vaginal formulation for chloroquine with preservation of its anti-HIV-1 activity. Gels containing the nonionic polymer hydroxyethyl cellulose were loaded with concentrations of the diphosphate salt of chloroquine (0.3-30 mg/g), that were 10 2 -to 10 4 -fold higher than typical in vitro anti-HIV-1 IC 50 -values of chloroquine (ca. 6 \u03bcg/ml). The gels were clear and homogeneous and displayed an osmolality of 300 mOsm/kg, a pH of 4.6 and a viscosity of 1.4 Pa s. Gel characteristics were preserved for at least 3 months at 40\u00b0C and 75% relative humidity. Importantly, the chloroquine gels exerted a dose-dependent anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro (mean IC 50 from 23 to 0.4 mg gel/ml) and the intrinsic activity of chloroquine was not affected by formulation factors. The in vitro efficacy of the chloroquine gel formulations warrants further testing of this drug as an anti-HIV-1 microbicide candidate.",

Microbicides are antiretroviral agents that prevent HIV transmission when topically applied in the vagina or rectum. In contrast to for instance condom use, microbicides should empower women to protect themselves. Especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where three times more 15-to 24-year-old women are now HIV-1 infected than men of the same age, an effective microbicide will have an important impact on the HIV epidemic (Quinn and Overbaugh, 2005) . In addition to its safety, acceptability and efficacy, the affordability of a microbicide will determine its success in resourcepoor countries. For some state-of-the-art microbicide candidates performing very well in preclinical studies (e.g. protein-and peptidebased microbicide candidates), a high manufacturing cost may be the most important hurdle hindering their real-world success (Klasse et al., 2006) . Therefore, available and inexpensive antiretroviral drugs, including the 4-aminoquinoline chloroquine, should not be ignored in the search for a useful microbicide.",

The mechanism of action of chloroquine has some consequences. First, as glycosylation in host cells is crucial for the replication of many viruses, it is not surprising that chloroquine is not only active against various HIV strains, but also against other viruses (e.g. SARS coronavirus; Keyaerts et al., 2004) among which also other sexually transmitted infections (e.g. hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex viruses; Rolain et al., 2007) . Secondly, the fact that chloroquine clearly affects host cellular enzymes (Naarding et al., 2007) may suggest that the likelihood of emergence of viral resistance against chloroquine is rather low. Finally, considering that the anti-HIV mechanism of chloroquine differs from mechanisms of commonly used antiretroviral drugs, combination can result in additive effects. This has been illustrated for the combination of chloroquine with hydroxyurea, the reverse transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine and didanosine and protease inhibitors (Boelaert et al., 2001; Savarino et al., 2004) .",

The most straightforward formulation strategy for microbicides are gels or creams, to be applied in the vagina before sexual intercourse (Garg et al., 2003) . To formulate chloroquine, we prepared an aqueous gel composed of the gelling polymer hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), the humectant glycerol, the preservatives propyl-and methylparaben and lactic acid as acidifier. This placebo formulation was loaded with the diphosphate salt of chloroquine at different concentrations. HEC is a stable, nonionic linear polymer with a good safety profile, shear-thinning rheology and moderate mucoadhesive properties (Grabovac et al., 2005; Tien et al., 2005) . Three independent batches of the gels were characterized with respect to fundamental properties, including appearance, pH, osmolality, viscosity and chloroquine loading.",

A volume of 50 \u03bcl was injected into a Hitachi LaChrom Elite HPLC system consisting of an L-2130 pump, an L-2200 autosampler, an L-2400 UV detector and EZChrom Elite software (VWR, Leuven, Belgium). The column used was a Purospher \u00ae Star RP-18 (150x4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm) and the mobile phase consisted of KH 2 PO 4 -buffer (50 mM, pH 3.5), methanol and acetonitrile (81:9:10, v/v). The flow was maintained at 1 ml/min. As indicated by absorbance monitoring at 341 nm, the retention time of chloroquine amounted to 5.6 min. Calibration curves of chloroquine diphosphate in a mixture of phosphate buffer and 1% placebo gel were linear over the concentration range from 0.05 to 100 \u03bcg/ml. Precision and accuracy were assessed by analyzing standard samples (n =5) of 0.05, 1 and 100 \u03bcg/ml. Assessment of intraday repeatability resulted in relative standard deviations of 4.1, 0.2 and 0.1%, respectively. The mean relative error amounted to \u22125.9, \u22120.8 and +2.7%, respectively.",

Briefly, 5-fold dilutions of the gels (starting at 100 mg gel/ml final concentration) or native chloroquine diphosphate powder in cell culture medium (100 \u03bcl) were added to 96well flat-bottomed plates (International Medical, Brussels, Belgium). Then, to each well, 7.5\u00b710 4 MT-4 cells were added in 50 \u03bcl of medium, followed by 50 \u03bcl (500 pg/ml p24 Ag, corresponding to twofold the 50% tissue culture infective dose TCID50) of diluted HIV-1 stock. Cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by the virus was checked microscopically at regular times. When strong CPE was observed (mostly after 4 or 5 days of incubation) in untreated HIV-infected cells, the supernatant of all samples was collected simultaneously and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. We assessed productive HIV-1 infection by measuring p24 Ag concentration in culture medium using a p24 Ag ELISA commercial kit (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). Finally, the IC 50 value of the compounds (i.e., the concentration of the compound required for 50% reduction in HIV replication as measured by the p24 antigen production) was calculated.",

HEC gels were loaded with different concentrations of the diphosphate salt of chloroquine (i.e., 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/g) and evaluated for their antiviral potency. MT-4 cells were infected with HIV-1 NL4.3 in the presence of a serial dilution of the gels. The IC 50 -values are the gel concentrations (mg gel/ml cell culture medium) required to reduce viral HIV-1 replication by 50% as calculated from the p24 content in the supernatant of infected cells at the end of the experiment (day 5). The placebo gel (no chloroquine) did not reduce HIV-1 replication at the concentrations tested (up to 100 mg gel/ml). Data represent mean \u00b1 sd of 3 independent experiments.",
