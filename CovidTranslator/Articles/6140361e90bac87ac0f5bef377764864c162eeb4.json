As ITDS systems detect a difference between the subject and the ambient temperature, the deployment of these systems is more challenging in hot climates, either in tropical or subtropical regions where year round transmission of respiratory pathogens occurs, or in temperate countries during emerging outbreaks in summer months.

The STE ITDS was the first thermal imager based system in the world designed for mass human temperature screening, developed and deployed during the SARS outbreak of 2003. 20 The basic setup consists of a mounted thermal imager which uses a Thermal Reference Source (TRS) as a reference to display the temperature profile of the subject. Temperature is represented as an illustration of different colours on a real-time monitor, each of which corresponds to a particular temperature, and the user interprets a febrile subject based on the hot spots on the subject's skin surface (see Fig. 1A ). The Omnisense Sentry MKIII is similar in setup to the STE IFSS, and has been marketed as a new generation ITDS with real-time calibration to ambient temperature with a claimed 0.1 C accuracy. It also has a video capture device that is digitally synchronized to the thermal image, with a dual video display which sets off an automated alarm and visual auto-tracking of the target once a febrile subject enters the screening area (see Fig. 1B ). It is in widespread use in various commercial buildings and hospitals locally. The Quick Shot Infrared Thermoscope is a handheld thermal scanner which displays the estimated core body temperature after it is directed a few centimetres from a subject's forehead, and is also widely used in the Singapore military, primary healthcare settings and childcare centres due to its portability and nonintrusiveness.",

Adequate training of observers on the identification of febrile subjects on the display monitor is also critical, as there is a spread of possible scenarios (such as size and intensity of red patches on the head regions). These factors may have resulted in the STE ITDS failing to detect nearly half of the febrile cases. The observers in this evaluation found that a high degree of attention was required for the STE ITDS, and subjective identification of febrile cases based on the distribution of hot zones made the screening process highly user-dependent. However, although the STE ITDS may be too insensitive to be used as a mass-screening test for fever in environmentally uncontrolled situation, it may be useful as a rule-in test when fever is already suspected, e.g., self-reported fever, due to its high specificity. Based on these findings, the SAF has undertaken an update of its fever screening systems. The handheld infrared thermoscope ITDS showed a low sensitivity. Various variables for the poor performance of handheld infrared fever screening devices have been previously identified in various studies. 14,17 A chief factor may be that the outdoor temperature had a far larger confounding effect on the handheld thermoscope ITDS compared to the other ITDS, especially when utilized without a dedicated TRS, resulting in a positive association with the ambient temperature on univariate analysis. This may have led to the preset threshold cut off temperatures becoming inaccurate if the environmental condition changes. 14 Though admittedly convenient, mass screening for febrile subjects should not be encouraged with the handheld infrared thermoscope ITDS, due to the high rate of false negative results.",

Moreover, traditional methods of fever measurement through oral and tympanic thermometers are timeconsuming and require close contact with potentially infectious patients. In such situations, the next generation ITDS can be employed for mass fever screening as it has a high throughput capability, with an acceptable sensitivity and specificity found in this study. However, it would require logistical arrangements to be made in that the subjects have to walk past the scanners along a predetermined route in single file within a sheltered (though not air-conditioned) area at a triage station.

However, such screening methods may reduce the magnitude of importation, and during an epidemic reduce disease spread in specific areas. Despite its advantages, caution has been expressed on the solitary use of ITDS for mass screening at points of entry, especially in a non-epidemic setting. Surveillance and contact tracing also play keys roles in the mitigation of a potential pandemic. 15 However, in a pandemic influenza scenario, one may expect a higher prevalence of fever and as a result a higher predictive value of the mass fever screening modalities.

This may impact the study findings; for example, the elderly may have a lower core temperature during infection, due to an attenuated inflammatory response, and therefore the sensitivity in diagnosing infections of all the screening measures considered may be lower in the population as a whole. Additionally, this study has an underrepresentation of females, in whom pregnancy, menstruation or hormonal treatments may cause variation in the external skin temperature, thereby influencing our results. 13 This evaluation was only conducted in one healthcare centre over one month. A multicentre study conducted over a longer time period would be useful to assess if the findings could be generalized to a pandemic situation which may be substantially longer than one month, and where fever screening would be utilized in various settings including border control and airports. However, given the lack of seasonality in equatorial Singapore, the weather during the month in which the study was performed is very similar to that throughout the rest of the year, the monsoon season excepting, and therefore we anticipate that the duration of the study will not limit the generality of our findings.",
