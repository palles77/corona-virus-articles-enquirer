Analysis of viral RNA, histopathological examinations, immunohistochemistry and serology were performed. After virus inoculation, neither clinical signs nor evident gross lesions were observed. Viral RNA, histopathological changes, and viral nucleoprotein were observed in the lung, trachea and sinus of all inoculated mice.

Some experimental evidence suggests that coronaviruses are not limited to replication in a single host, and this is especially true of those that infect mammals [20] . Indeed, close contact of animals of different species in domestic environments and wildlife markets as well as close contact with humans may allow interspecies jumping and could subsequently pose risks of further genetic changes if the virus adapts to human hosts, as has occurred in the case of SARS [3] and H5N1 virus [17] . In the intensive poultry industry, poultry are increasingly exposed to pathogens of other birds and mammals and vice versa. An experimental study showed that bovine coronavirus (BCV) is pathogenic for 1-day-old turkey poults [10] . In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate whether avian coronaviruses can replicate, are pathogenic, and induce an immune response in mice.",

The animals, 6-to 8-week-old specificpathogen-free females, were purchased from CEMIB (Multidisciplinary Centre for Biological Investigation, [6] , named 810 (BR-I) and 67T (Mass), and one vaccine strain (H120-Mass) (Bio-Bronk-Vet-H120, Laborat\u00f3rio Biovet, Vargem Grande Paulista, Brasil) were used. Thirty-six BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: a control group and three groups inoculated with virus (strains 67T, 810 or H120). Six A/J mice were inoculated with the H120 vaccine strain, and six A/J mice were kept as a control group. Mice were anesthetized and inoculated intranasally with 50 lL of a suspension containing 10 6 EID 50 of IBV per mouse according to previous studies [16] . BALB/c and A/J mice were monitored daily for two weeks for weight loss and survival. Subsequently, real-time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR) was employed to detect viral RNA in the sinus, trachea, lung, and duodenum. Tissues were homogenized in 400 lL of icecold Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA), and supernatants were harvested after centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 9 g at 4\u00b0C. Viral RNA from tissue suspensions were purified using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RRT-PCR targeting the 5 0 untranslated region (5 0 UTR) of IBV was used [1] . The copy number was calculated using a standard curve, and beta actin was used as an internal control as described previously [7] . One-way analysis of variance and Student's t-test were carried out to compare differences among groups, and the differences were considered significant at P \\ 0.05. Histopathological evaluation was performed to assess whether the mice displayed any histopathological lesions related to infection. Trachea, lung, and duodenum of inoculated BALB/c mice were collected at 3 and 10 dpi and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 12 h at room temperature. The specimens were treated with xylene, dehydrated in graded ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-lm-thick sections. Histopathological changes were evaluated in sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Additionally, the slides were subjected to immunohistochemistry for detection of virus in the tissues. Immunostaining was performed according to a previous study [11] . After treatment with Triton X-100 (#93443, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) to permeabilize the cells, the tissue sections were incubated for 12 hours with a 1:20 dilution of a Mean \u00b1 standard error at time points with no common superscript differ significantly (P \\ 0.05). Differences were only observed when more than one mouse was detected by the test. The limit of detection was 105.38 copies per mL monoclonal primary antibody targeting the IBV nucleoprotein (no. nAB90926, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The slides were then incubated with a 1:20 dilution of goat anti-IgG biotin conjugate (no. B7264, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). After washing, each slide was treated with a solution of avidin and biotinylated peroxidase. The reaction was visualized by adding a solution containing the substrate (H 2 O 2 ) and the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and examined using an optical microscope (Zeiss).",

Interestingly, viral RNA and histopathological changes in different organs were more evident in inoculated BALB/c mice, suggesting that these mice are more susceptible than A/J mice to avian coronavirus infection. BALB/c mice have been shown to be susceptible to experimental infection with avian paramyxoviruses and recombinant avian paramyxoviruses [11, 12] ; but other studies have shown that A/J and C57BL/6 mice were more susceptible to infection with bovine respiratory syncytial virus than BALB/ c mice [15] and that no difference was observed after infection with mouse hepatitis virus [13] . In our study, all tissue changes correlated to the detection of viral RNA by RRT-PCR or viral nucleoprotein by immunostaining, suggesting that virus replication had occurred, although virus isolation was not attempted. Viral nucleoprotein was strongly detected at 3 dpi, suggesting that the presence of virus correlated with severe histological changes. Those findings are in accordance with an acute inflammatory state [8] . Additionally, viral RNA, histopathological lesions and viral antigen were also more pronounced at 3 dpi than at 10 dpi, suggesting that replication occurred for a short time. Low levels of antibodies specific for IBV were detected at 3 dpi, suggesting slight IgM production, which is typically associated with the primary immune response. Nonetheless, no specific antibody was detected at 10 dpi, suggesting that this antibody response was not important given its short duration.",
