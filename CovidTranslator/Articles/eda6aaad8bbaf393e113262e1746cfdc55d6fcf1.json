ACE2 is considered an endogenous regulator of the vasoconstrictive, proliferative, fibrotic, and proinflammatory effects of the ACE-Ang II-angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) axis. Both animal and clinical studies have emerged to define a role for ACE2 in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). There is scientific evidence supporting the concept that ACE2 maintains the RAS balance and plays a protective role in PAH. The activation of pulmonary ACE2 could influence the pathogenesis of PAH and serve as a novel therapeutic target in PAH. Current therapeutic strategies and interventions have limited success, and PAH remains a fatal disease. Thus, more research that establishes the novel therapeutic potential and defines the mechanism of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas counterregulatory axis in PAH is needed.",

The ACE-Ang II-AT 1 R axis promotes vasoconstriction, proliferation, and fibrosis, whereas the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis protects lungs. The ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis intrinsically induces vasoprotective actions by counterregulating the ACE-Ang II-AT 1 Raxis. This review focuses on the vasoprotective axis of the RAS as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in PAH.

This remodeling causes increased pulmonary vascular resistance resulting in a mean pulmonary arterial pressure greater than 25 mm Hg at rest. Persistent elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance leads to right heart failure and death [6\u2022\u2022] . PAH is a consequence of vascular effector imbalance, perturbations in the homeostasis of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators, growth inhibitors and mitogenic factors, and antithrombotic and prothrombotic factors [8] . As a result of these findings, vasodilator, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, and vascular remodeling therapies have been used for PAH treatment. Before current intervention strategies, life expectancy for adults with idiopathic PAH was less than 3 years from diagnosis; for children, it was less than 10 months [9] . There are complex strategies for treating PAH patients that include both supportive and specific drug therapy. Specific drug therapy often falls into three categories: vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, and endothelin receptor antagonists. The latest clinical trials have strategically targeted remodeling, including the testing of antiproliferative drugs in advanced human PAH.",

In a lung injury model induced by acid aspiration or sepsis, ACE2 deletion worsens the injury. Aortas from ACE2-deficient mice exhibit impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation [10] . This RAS imbalance is further supported by literature revealing that severe lung failure on an ACE2 knockout background was rescued by ACE inactivation [12] .",

Because PVR occurs in PAH, studies that prevent, limit, or regress PVR are important for progress in the field. In a sepsis-induced ACE2 knockout model of acute lung injury, treatment with recombinant human ACE2 protein provided direct protection [12] . This study also suggests that Ang II, ACE, and AT 1 a receptor promote lung injury, whereas ACE2 and AT 2 receptor protect against lung injury. ACE2 overexpression improves endothelial cell migration and tube formation [10] . We have demonstrated in MCT-treated mice that pulmonary ACE2 overexpression via lentiviral vector both prevents and reverses the increases in right ventricular systolic pressure, significantly attenuates and partially reverses muscularization of pulmonary vessel, and increases the AT 2 R:AT 1 R mRNA ratio [14] . Our studies further reveal that activation of endogenous ACE2 by XNT (1-[(2-dimethylamino) ethylamino]-4-(hydroxymethyl)-7-[(4-methylphenyl) sulfonyl oxy]-9H-xanthene-9-one) prevents pulmonary vascular remodeling in PH development [2\u2022\u2022] . XNT reversed cardiac hypertrophy, ventricular fibrosis, and renal interstitial fibrosis; prevented an increase in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and right ventricular hypertrophy; and attenuated vascular wall thickening and pulmonary fibrosis. XNT decreased proinflammatory cytokine levels, increased antiinflammatory cytokine levels, and increased ACE2 activity. XNT had no adverse effects on systemic blood pressure. These effects are inhibited by an Ang-(1-7) antagonist, A779, demonstrating that ACE2 may produce beneficial effects via Ang-(1-7) [2\u2022\u2022]. Interestingly, ACE2 overexpression in the smooth muscle of spontaneously hypertensive stroke prone rats (SHRSP) resulted in increased aortic ACE2 activity, Ang-(1-7), and Ang II and improved vascular function [15] .

We believe that the beneficial effects of the system involve a shift from the vasoconstrictive, proliferative, and fibrotic axes to the vasoprotective axis of the RAS, and thus targeting the RAS in PH should be revisited, with ACE2 as the therapeutic target. Unlike ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE2 is an endogenous regulator of the RAS. Therapy with ACE inhibitors and ARBs indirectly increases ACE2 and Ang-(1-7), but ACE2 activation would directly increase the enzyme to promote beneficial effects. Like ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy, ACE2 activation attenuates remodeling and fibrosis and affects the vascular relaxation properties of the endothelium. RAS intervention studies in PH are inconclusive, and the role of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis activation in PH has not been confirmed with clinical trials.",

            "text": "Enalapril, another ACE inhibitor, was given concomitantly with MCT in a chronic PAH rat model fed a high-cholesterol diet [17] . This therapeutic intervention attenuated the development of PAH while preserving the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), demonstrating a role for RAS and NO in the development of PAH. In a hypoxic rat model of PAH, the dose-dependent effects of perindopril, an ACE inhibitor, on vascular remodeling did not restore pulmonary vascular function and had only a modest effect on pulmonary artery pressure [18] . Losartan, an AT 1 R antagonist, attenuated smoke-induced pulmonary artery remodeling, RVSP elevation, and Ang II accumulation, and increased ACE2 in rat lungs [19\u2022 ]. Okada et al. [20] demonstrated that telmisartan, an AT 1 R antagonist, attenuated right ventricular (RV) remodeling via inhibition of RV hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction in MCT-treated male Wistar rats. Yet the acceleration time:ejection time ratio of pulmonary artery flow velocity was not significantly different than the ratio for controls. In clinical trials in human patients, ACE inhibitor therapy has been tested to treat PAH. Tavli et al. [21] conducted a small proof-of-concept trial in 30 PAH patients with stable chronic congestive heart failure and demonstrated that cilazapril, an ACE inhibitor, significantly decreased mean pulmonary and capillary wedge pressures. This drug also increased flowmediated vasodilatation, improved left ventricular ejection fraction, and improved the functional class of patients. Both systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures were significantly decreased after 12 weeks of captopril treatment in 17 patients with high-altitude PH and mildto-moderate systemic arterial hypertension [22] . Conversely, Bilan et al. [23] demonstrated in a 1-year placebo-controlled study of 41 PAH patients with scleroderma that enalapril did not alter LV systolic or diastolic function and heart diameter, and signs of PH were found in four of the patients. Zieli\u0144ski et al. [24] demonstrated in 15 patients with hypoxic PH due to chronic obstructive lung disease that acute administration of captopril significantly decreased systemic arterial pressure but does not reduce PVR. In addition to blocking ACE and angiotensin receptors of the ACE-Ang II-AT 1 R axis, these inhibitors increase ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) expression levels in rats and humans [25] . In patients with primary PH, higher cardiac ACE2 activity and Ang-(1-7) levels provide cardioprotection; and in patients with pulmonary fibrosis, ACE2 expression is decreased [26] . These findings may indicate that ACE inhibition may be less effective in scleroderma and hypoxic PH or that it may be more effective in attenuation of remodeling when given earlier during the disease state. In addition to regressing remodeling, ACE inhibitors lower systemic blood pressure and therefore may not be beneficial for PH patients with right heart failure.",

They were also the first to demonstrate in vascular SMCs that MAP kinase-phosphatase pathway regulates ACE2 and maintains the balance between Ang II and Ang-(1-7). Ang-(1-7) functions through NO or prostaglandins and has antifibrotic and antioxidant properties. Gwathmey et al.

Wang et al. [33, 34] demonstrated that circulating Ang-(1-7) stimulated cardiac endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) proliferation benefiting myocardial infarction. Tallant et al. [35] suggest that Ang-(1-7) inhibits vascular growth through the release of prostacyclin, the prostacyclin-mediated production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and the attenuation of MAP kinase activation.

The TGF-\u03b2 superfamily encompasses a large number of growth factors such as TGF-\u03b2 ligands, activins, inhibins, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). BMPS are involved in vascular integrity and control of vascular cell proliferation [36] . Both TGF-\u03b2 and BMP isoforms control endothelial cell and SMC proliferation, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion and deposition. BMPR-II and BMPR-1A plasma membrane protein expression is decreased in pulmonary endothelial cells in both heritable and sporadic PAH. BMPR-II has been localized to the endothelium and vascular SMCs of small pulmonary arteries [37] . Signal transduction studies reveal that BMP signals are mediated by type I and II receptors through downstream mediators, Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8. They form a complex with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus. The function of BMPR-II is to mediate growth suppression and apoptosis in vasculature [38] . Thus a loss of BMPR-II function may lead to the vasculopathy evident in PAH [39] . Late cultured EPCs from idiopathic PAH patients with BMPR-II mutation showed a hyperproliferative phenotype with impaired ability to form vascular networks [40] .",

Thus, TGF-\u03b2 and BMP appear to play opposing roles ( Fig. 1 ) in maintenance and growth of pulmonary artery SMCs and endothelial cells [42] . Studies suggest an inhibitory effect of BMP signaling on pulmonary artery SMCs. Such cells from PAH patients are resistant to antiproliferative effects of BMP. TGF-\u03b2 gain of proliferation and BMPR-II loss of growth suppression and inability to promote vascular SMC apoptosis may promote PAH development.",

Current therapy addresses vasoconstrictor imbalance and endothelial dysfunction, but vasodilator therapy has yet to improve patient survival. Unlike epoprostenol, a prostacyclin analogue and potent vasodilator, most PAH therapies have not improved survival. Therefore, new therapies that target PVR are emerging. Increasing evidence supports the concept of an imbalance in various components of the RAS. Animal and human trials demonstrate that an imbalance that favors the ACE-Ang II-AT 1 R axis actions promotes proliferation, fibrosis, and growth. There is no current consensus for the efficacy of therapeutic PAH strategies such as ACEs or ARBs in human and animal models, yet the benefit of ACE2 overexpression and activation in lung is consistent. In PAH, ACE2 overexpression and activation exerts its effects via the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis, limiting the detrimental actions of the ACE-Ang II-AT 1 R axis and playing a protective role in PH. The exact mechanism of benefit remains elusive, but the benefit in both prevention and reversal studies in animal models is clear. Thus, activation of ACE2 is a novel and effective strategy for PAH that must be considered.
