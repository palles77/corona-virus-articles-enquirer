All IgG monoclonals isolated bound to P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) and recognized distinct epitopes in the N-terminus, NANP repeat region, and Cterminus. Strikingly, the most effective antibodies, as assessed in a humanized mouse model, bound not only to the repeat region, but also to a minimal peptide at the PfCSP N-terminal junction that is not in the RTS,S vaccine. These dual-specific antibodies were isolated from different donors and used VH3-30 or VH3-33 alleles carrying tryptophan or arginine at position 52. Using structural and mutational data, we describe the elements required for germline recognition and affinity maturation. Our study provides potent neutralizing antibodies and relevant information for lineage-targeted vaccine design and immunization strategies.",

            "text": "Malaria is a serious global health threat, causing 445,000 deaths and 216 million clinical cases in 2016 1 . Much of the effort to develop a vaccine against the disease has focused on Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ), the asymptomatic parasite stage that is injected by mosquitoes into the host skin to initiate a malaria infection. After entering the skin, PfSPZ migrate to the liver, multiply in hepatocytes and then emerge in the blood, where the parasites cause malaria symptoms and differentiate into sexual stages for transmission. While natural infection by PfSPZ elicits little or no protective immunity to this stage of the life cycle 2,3 , subunit or whole organism vaccines based on PfSPZ can induce robust immune responses [4] [5] [6] . The most advanced malaria vaccine candidate, RTS,S, incorporates part of the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP), which coats the PfSPZ surface and plays a key role in parasite migration out of the skin, entry into the liver parenchyma and invasion of hepatocytes [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Multi-site clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa have shown that RTS,S confers significant but modest and short-lived protection against clinical illness 10, 13, 14 . An alternative approach that has shown promise is the use of whole attenuated PfSPZ as immunogens. This line of research is based on key early discoveries that immunization with irradiated P. berghei sporozoites protected mice against subsequent challenge 15 and that immunization of humans with >1000 irradiated mosquitoes carrying PfSPZ conferred sterilizing protection against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) [16] [17] [18] . These studies have led to efforts to develop whole attenuated PfSPZ as a vaccine 19 , and recent trials have shown that immunization with attenuated PfSPZ was highly protective in malaria-na\u00efve volunteers and gave significant protection in Malian adults 6, [20] [21] [22] . While these results are promising, the specific mediators of this protective immune response have yet to be fully elucidated. Studies of the antibody response have mainly investigated polyclonal serum responses to PfSPZ and PfCSP 6, [20] [21] [22] , and highresolution analysis of the monoclonal antibodies generated by vaccination and their target antigens on the PfSPZ surface remains to be performed. These experiments could provide useful information for the improvement of whole sporozoite-based vaccines and for the identification of new antigens as subunit vaccine candidates, as well as to generate tools for prophylaxis of P. falciparum infection.",

Serum IgM and IgG antibodies, as measured by flow cytometry on live PfSPZ, increased following immunization, but did not show a clear association with protection from CHMI (Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b) . Memory B cells from five protected individuals were immortalized and screened by staining of intact PfSPZ to isolate human monoclonal antibodies against any surface antigen on PfSPZ ( Supplementary Fig. 1c) . Most of the IgG monoclonal antibodies bound to PfSPZ with high affinity (Fig. 1d,e) . Interestingly, in the two donors from whom both PfSPZ-specific IgM and IgG monoclonal antibodies were isolated, the IgM antibodies were recovered at much higher numbers (Fig. 1f ). The IgM antibodies had fewer, but still substantial, mutations compared to the IgG antibodies, consistent with an origin from IgM memory B cells (Fig. 1g ). In particular, the finding of an antibody lineage containing both IgM and IgG members suggests an incomplete switch in this response despite repeated immunization ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ). These results demonstrate that immunizations with PfSPZ Vaccine induce a robust antibody response that retains a significant IgM component.",

The invasioninhibitory activity varied among antibodies and was significantly correlated with binding affinity to PfSPZ (Fig. 2b) . A subset of antibodies was further tested in an in vivo mouse humanized liver model for their capacity to protect against natural, mosquito bitetransmitted infection by PfSPZ. Some antibodies, such as MGG3, MGG4, MGH2, MGU10 and MGU12, were very potent in reducing liver burden by up to 98.3%, while others, such as MGG8, MGH1, MGH3 and MGU1, were less effective (Fig. 2c) . These findings suggest that in vivo neutralizing activity may be related to the fine specificity of the antibodies.",

Strikingly, although we had used an antigen-agnostic approach to identify antibodies that bound to the PfSPZ surface regardless of specificity, we found that all of the antibodies bound to recombinant PfCSP (Fig. 2d,e) , confirming that this is the most immunogenic protein on the PfSPZ surface [23] [24] [25] . To understand the basis for effective neutralization, we mapped the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies using synthetic peptides that cover the N-terminus, the NANP repeat region, the N-terminal junction (connecting region between the N-terminal domain and NANP repeats), and the C-terminus of PfCSP. Binding to the classical NANP repeats (NANP18 peptide), the PfCSP C-terminus, recombinant PfCSP or PfSPZ did not correlate with efficacy ( Supplementary Fig. 2a-d) . Interestingly, however, binding to a minimal 15-mer peptide (NPDP15) that covers the junction between the N-terminal domain and the NANP repeats was a shared characteristic of the most potent in vivo neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 2f) . These potent antibodies also recognized the NANP18 peptide, suggesting that the capacity to bind both to the NANP repeats and to the N-terminal junction of PfCSP is the main feature of efficient neutralization. Another distinctive characteristic of the most potent antibodies was the common usage of VH3-30 family alleles carrying tryptophan or arginine at position 52 (VH3-30 f , here defined as including VH3-30, VH3-30-3, VH3-30-5 and VH3-33 alleles sharing >96% identity) (Fig. 2e , Supplementary  Fig. 3 ,4, Supplementary Table 1 ). Strikingly, VH3-30 f was the most common VH gene used by IgM antibodies isolated from donors G and U, with almost 90% of such antibodies carrying W52 or R52 ( Supplementary Fig. 2e ). Collectively, these data indicate that the most potent antibodies have a dual specificity and share common VH gene usage. Importantly, such antibodies were isolated from four out of five donors, suggesting that these antibodies belong to a public lineage and therefore have the potential to be readily induced by vaccination.",

            "text": "To investigate the influence of somatic mutations on binding of VH3-30 f antibodies to PfCSP, we focused on two clonally related and highly mutated antibodies, MGU1 and MGU10 (Fig. 3a) . The unmutated common ancestor (UCA) of these antibodies, which carries tryptophan at position 52, was able to bind to PfCSP and PfSPZ with low affinity, while substitution to serine 52, which is commonly found in VH3-30 alleles, resulted in loss of binding (Fig. 3b,c) . These findings, in conjunction with the high frequency of W52 in the IgM sequences and the identification of putative VH3-30 f alleles carrying W52 in the germline sequences obtained from non-B cells of donors G, U and W ( Supplementary Fig.  3,4) , identify VH3-30 f alleles carrying W52 as a preferred feature for the initiation of this lineage-specific antibody response to PfCSP. The branch point of this clone achieved, through several mutations, high affinity binding to PfSPZ, PfCSP and NANP18, while further mutations in MGU10, but not MGU1, increased breadth by conferring the unique ability to bind to NPDP15 (Fig. 3b-e, Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Despite their similarities in binding to PfSPZ, PfCSP and NANP18, MGU10 was substantially more potent than MGU1 in the in vivo assay (Fig. 2c) , suggesting that acquisition of binding to NPDP15 is the key factor for potent neutralization. Interestingly, mutagenesis studies of MGU10 suggest that W52 remains a critical residue for binding to NPDP15, but becomes dispensable for high affinity binding to NANP and full-length PfCSP in the fully mutated antibody (Fig. 3f ). In contrast, in a second clonal family consisting of MGU5 and MGU8, full binding to PfCSP, NANP18, NPDP15 and PfSPZ was already achieved by the branch point while the remaining mutations appeared redundant ( Supplementary Fig. 6a -e).",

Most UCAs bound to NANP18 but not to NPDP15, suggesting that the antibodies generally started as NANP-specific and gained affinity for NPDP15 through somatic mutations ( Supplementary Fig. 6f-m) . These data delineate a pathway of antibody development that is dependent on specific VH alleles and leads to antibodies with dual specificity. To identify the minimal residues recognized by antibodies at the PfCSP Nterminal junction, we performed a mutational analysis on NPDP19, a 19-mer version of NPDP15 that was used to provide a longer scaffold for binding (Fig. 3g) . The loss of binding to certain peptides identified a specific motif (DPNANP) that was recognized by most antibodies regardless of VH gene usage. These findings, combined with data from peptide array experiments ( Supplementary Fig. 7) , identify the N-terminal junction binding site of the most potent neutralizing antibodies as including the first unit of the NANP repeat region and flanking non-repeat sequences, providing a molecular basis for the dual specificity of these antibodies.",

            "text": "To gain structural insights into the recognition of the N-terminal junction, we attempted to crystallize several VH3-30 f antibodies and successfully crystallized MGG4 in complex with the Ac-1 KQPADGNPDPNANP 14 -NH 2 peptide ( Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 2) . Only the C-terminal half (NPDPNAN, residues 7-13) of the peptide was visible, with most of the contacts being made by heavy-chain residues as shown by the Fab buried surface area (Fig.  4b) . Specifically, the heavy-chain CDR loops form a groove in which the peptide resides ( Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 8a ). In addition, three interfacial waters are involved in an extensive hydrogen-bonding network, connecting the side chain of N11 to the base of CDR H1 and CDR H3 ( Supplementary Fig. 8b ). The CH/\u03c0 interaction between P10 and W52 ( Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 8b ) confirms that the latter residue is critical for binding as indicated by the mutagenesis experiments. While most peptide residues, except for N13, display a relatively large buried surface area (Fig. 4c) , weak electron density for the residues visible at the peptide's termini (N7, P8, A12 and N13) ( Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 8c ) indicates structural flexibility and highlights the sequence DPN as the principal binding motif. Interestingly, the DPN sequence displays a pseudo 3 10 turn, which is stabilized by hydrogen bonding of the aspartate side chain to the asparagine backbone amide. Such a conformation is very similar to turns observed for unbound NANP peptides in solution and in crystal structures of free and antibody-bound peptides (Fig. 4d) [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . An isolated DPN motif is also present in the 282-383 C-terminal peptide, which may explain its binding to MGG4 (Fig. 2e) , notwithstanding the significant differences between the DPN flanking residues in the 282-383 C-terminal and the N-terminal junctional peptides (NDPNR versus PDPNA, respectively). Binding to both NPDP and NANP repeats suggests that the aspartate residue in the DPN motif is interchangeable with an asparagine. Binding studies of MGG4 to NPDP19 peptide mutants validate the specificity of MGG4 toward DPN and NPN motifs (Fig. 3g) . Only when the central DPN and NPN motifs within the NPDP19 peptide are mutated to DPA and AAN is MGG4 binding completely abrogated. In contrast, a third DPN motif present at the C-terminus of the NPDP19 peptide does not contribute to binding, possibly indicating the importance of flanking residues for optimal binding. Overall, these data imply that potential peptide-binding promiscuity allows MGG4 to bind to diverse epitopes on PfCSP. Since other VH3-30 f antibodies cannot bind to the 282-383 peptide, we expect that they will be less promiscuous and bind slightly larger or more specific sequences.",

All mice produced IgG antibodies that were specific for the NPDP19 peptide, but were at best weakly reactive for the NANP18 peptide ( Supplementary Fig. 9a,b) . Strikingly, in spite of their ability to bind to PfSPZ, the mouse sera were unable to inhibit PfSPZ invasion of a hepatocyte cell line in vitro, suggesting that dual specificity for NANP and the N-terminal junction may be required for potent neutralizing function ( Supplementary Fig.  9c,d) . The reliance of the dual-specific antibodies that we isolated on specific human VH3-30 f alleles suggests that mice, which do not have the counterparts of human VH3-30 f genes, may not be the most suitable model organism to test a novel CSP-based vaccine. Rather, an organism such as the Aotus monkey, which has a more similar VH gene repertoire to humans and contains VH3-30 f -like genes carrying the equivalent of W52 30 , may be a more suitable choice.",

The large IgM component would be consistent with stimulation of marginal zone B cells in the spleen following intravenous immunization with a particulate antigen 32 . Strikingly, all of the IgG antibodies that we identified recognized PfCSP, consistent with previous studies describing the immunodominance of this protein and its abundance on the PfSPZ surface [23] [24] [25] 33, 34 . Our findings are in agreement with previous work that separately describes the importance of the PfCSP NANP repeat region and of the N-terminus 23,35-37 , but, importantly, highlight the fact that antibodies that target epitopes in both regions simultaneously are more potent than antibodies that exclusively recognize each individual site. Interestingly, the structural analysis and peptide mutational data indicate that these antibodies, which are originally specific for NANP motifs, do not acquire a completely unrelated specificity, but rather gain promiscuity for sequences centred on a DPN motif. This dual specificity is to a large extent encoded by VH3-30 f alleles, but also requires extensive somatic mutations. The importance of dual specificity is highlighted by the fact that immunization with a single NPDP19 peptide is not sufficient to confer protection despite eliciting PfSPZ-binding antibodies.",

These results are reminiscent of previous work on the use of particular VH genes and their allelic forms in the response to the stem of influenza haemagglutinin 40, 41 and justify further efforts to investigate the role of VH gene polymorphisms in protective antibody responses. Nevertheless, whether these antibodies are sufficient to protect humans and why some individuals were not protected remain to be established. Possible reasons for the latter include the lack of a VH3-30 f allele, the incomplete maturation of the VH3-30 f antibodies, or insufficient production of the potent antibodies. The antibodies described could be used to obtain proof of concept that antibodies alone can be protective in vivo in humans, as previously shown in mice and non-human primates [42] [43] [44] , and pave the way for the use of antibodies in the prophylaxis of P. falciparum infection and for the development of improved antibody-based subunit malaria vaccines.",
