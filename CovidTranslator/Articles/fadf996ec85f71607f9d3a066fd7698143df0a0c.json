In 19 of the studied farms additional fecal samples from apparently healthy pen-mates were collected and tested for the same panel of infectious agents. Samples were bacteriologically cultured and tested by PCR for E. coli virulence factors genes, C. perfringens types A and C toxins (Cp\u03b1, Cp\u03b2, Cp\u03b22) and C. difficile toxins (TcdA, TcdB). Moreover, Rotavirus A (RVA), Rotavirus B (RVB), Rotavirus C (RVC), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were also determined by RT-qPCR. More than one pathogen could be detected in all of the outbreaks. Nevertheless, RVA was the only agent that could be statistically correlated with the outcome of diarrhea. For the other viruses and bacteria analyzed significant differences between the diseased pigs and the controls were not found. In spite of this, the individual analysis of each of the studied farms indicated that other agents such as RVB, RVC, toxigenic C. difficile or pathogenic E. coli could play a relevant role in the outbreak of diarrhea. In conclusion, the large diversity of agent combinations and disease situations detected in neonatal diarrhea outbreaks of this study stand for a more personalized diagnosis and management advice at a farm level.",

Infectious and non-infectious factors can be involved in diarrhea outbreaks in suckling piglets. Among non-infectious factors stress, poor husbandry and nutrition can contribute to an animal's susceptibility to disease. Moreover, enteric outbreaks are usually associated to the presence of infectious agents, such as viruses, bacteria or coccidian, although the presence of pathogens in piglets alone does not determine the occurrence of diarrhea episodes (Ruiz et al., 2016) . All those pathogens can act as primary and sole agents of scours in piglets although co-infections are commonly reported (Kongsted et al., 2018; Mesonero-Escuredo et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "In recent years, viruses -particularly coronaviruses and rotaviruses-have regained attention as agents of diarrhea in pigs. In regards to rotaviruses, although several genogroups (A, B, C, E and H) have been associated with porcine diarrhea, rotavirus A (RVA) is the most frequent (Marthaler et al., 2014) . Other species such as rotavirus B (RVB) and C (RVC) have been identified less commonly in diarrheal outbreaks (Morin et al., 1990; Martella et al., 2007; Amimo et al., 2013b) . RVB has been reported in several Asian countries, North America, South Africa and Brazil, but rarely in Europe (Smitalova et al., 2009; Otto et al., 2015) . However, there are still few studies conducted on RVB, RVC and other genogroups to determine their importance in porcine diarrhea outbreaks. Regarding porcine coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) can also cause diarrheal outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality in neonatal pigs. However, since 2014 the most recent outbreaks in Europe have been related with PEDV ( Carvajal et al., 2015; Laranjo et al., 2015) . As regards bacterial infections, Escherichia coli (E. coli) has historically been considered one of the main agents causing neonatal diarrhea in pigs (Chan et al., 2013) . Different E. coli pathotypes have been identified based on toxin production and other virulence factors. The most common are the enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) strains, characterized by the production of enterotoxins (STa, STb and LT). Other pathotypes of E.coli have been detected in piglets, such as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strains, producing intimin (eae gene), although less frequently (Toledo et al., 2012) . Anaerobic bacterial pathogens such as enterotoxigenic strains of Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) type A (producing Cp\u03b1 toxin), C. perfringens type C (producing Cp\u03b1 and Cp\u03b2 toxins) and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) producing enterotoxin A (TcdA) and/or cytotoxin B (TcdB) have also been reported in diseased piglets (Uzal and Songer, 2019) .",

A recent study made in Danish pigs affected by the new neonatal porcine diarrhea syndrome (NNPDS) found that regarding rotaviruses only 9% of pigs were positive to RVA and none to RVC by RT-qPCR (Goecke et al., 2017) . By contrast, for RVB, differences in the frequency of this pathogen in diseased and healthy piglets were clearer although the global RVB prevalence was low. Thus, in the context of our study, both RVA and RVB could be considered as prominent causing agents of diarrhea in some outbreaks.",

Regarding the positive samples to TGEV in the present study it must be mentioned that the PCR that we used could not distinguish TGEV from porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) since the target gene was the viral nucleocapside. Besides this, the spread of PRCV across Europe since its emergence in the 1980 decade reduced the prevalence of TGEV because of the crossed immunity between the two viruses. Nowadays diarrhea caused by TGEV is uncommon in Europe (Saif et al., 2012) .",

Since C. perfringens type A is a common gut microorganism, the detection of this agent cannot be interpreted unambiguously, given that it is not possible to distinguish commensal from pathogenic strains. Thus, although it has been considered as a main pathogen involved in persistent neonatal diarrhea (Mesonero-Escuredo et al., 2018) , a direct pathogen-toxin-disease association has not been yet determined (Kongsted et al., 2013 , Kongsted et al., 2018 . As regards C. perfringens type C, the prevalence detected in the present study was low. This could be the result of the routine vaccination plan implemented in sows (Salvarani et al., 2013) .",

However, in our study, the general prevalence of toxigenic C. difficile was similar in both healthy and diarrheic animals. Other studies have reported a high prevalence of C. difficile toxins in healthy animals concluding no clear relationship between diarrheal outbreaks and the detection of toxigenic C. difficile in pigs (Yaeger et al., 2007; \u00c1lvarez-P\u00e9rez et al., 2009 ). ETEC has been and still is considered the main agent responsible for intestinal disorders in neonatal piglets being F4, F5, F6 and F41, the main fimbriae associated with diarrhea, (Dubreuil et al., 2016; Luppi et al., 2016) . In the present study, ETEC strains were infrequently isolated from both diarrheic and non-diarrheic piglets, similar to the results reported previously by others (Kongsted et al., 2013; Kongsted et al., 2018; Larsson et al., 2015; Mesonero-Escuredo et al., 2018) . This low prevalence of E. coli pathotypes and virulent factors is probably related to the E. coli vaccination programs implemented in sows in the Spanish farms. Most of these vaccines available on the market contain E. coli fimbriae (mostly F4, F5, F6 and F41) and toxoids (such as LT), and therefore, prevent the infection caused by pathogenic strains of E. coli. By contrast, EAST1 positive E. coli were very common. The pathogenic role of the EAST1 toxin is not clear, given that it has also been found in a high prevalence in strains from healthy animals of our study in agreement with the results published by Zajacova et al. (2012) .Nevertheless, in some farms in which RVA was not considered to be the main causative agent, the diarrheic process of the piglets could be associated to pathogenic E. coli or toxigenic C. difficile strains.",
