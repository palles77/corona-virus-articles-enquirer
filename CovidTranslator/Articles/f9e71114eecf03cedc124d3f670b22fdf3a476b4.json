CVB3 is a single stranded, non-enveloped RNA virus and the infection can cause prominent health threat to pre-school children. Here, by taking approaches of reverse genetics, we established a single-round infection system for CVB3. The pseudovirus was produced by sequential transfection of CVB3 capsid expresser plasmid and CVB3 replicon RNA bearing firefly luciferase as a reporter. The CVB3 pseudovirus system was used for quantifying neutralizing antibody (NtAb) levels of 720 human serum samples and showed superior specificity and sensitivity comparing traditional cytopathic effect (CPE) assay. Furthermore, we compared the seroprevalence of CVB3 NtAbs in pre-school children and healthy adults, and found that only 11.94% of pre-school children were NtAbs positive which suggested that most children were naive to CVB3 infection; while there is much higher positive rate in adults (60%) indicating that most adults have experienced CVB3 infection during childhood. This rapid and quantitative assay greatly facilitates evaluating the level of NtAbs against CVB3 in populations and will help to advance CVB3 vaccine development.",

            "text": "Neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) elicited after viral infection or vaccination conveyed humoral protection to the population and are essential to viral defense. Thus quantification of NtAbs would be an important criterion in vaccine evaluation as well as the assessment of group protection in human populations before or after vaccination. There are traditional neutralization assay based on inhibition of cytopathic effect (CPE) for viruses that can cause CPE effect on susceptible cell lines in vitro including Enterovirus 71 (EV71) (Chang et al., 2002) , Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) as well as CVB3. However, CPE methods usually take 5-7 days of inoculation to let plaques develop and are labor-intensive. Modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays which significantly reduced the duration time still have its shortcomings, such as biosafety concerns raised by live viruses, limited sensitivity, and semi quantitative results due to poor linearity (Huang et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2014) . However, pseudovirus based neutralization assays have distinct advantages, as single-round infection ensures superior biosafety and luciferase reporter enables sensitive quantification (Bentley et al., 2015) . Pseudovirus based neutralization assays have been widely used to measure neutralizing antibodies for enveloped viruses, such as Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Montefiori, 2005) , Influenza virus (Tsai et al., 2009) , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-coV) (Li et al., 2003; Sui et al., 2004) . Most pseudoviruses of enveloped viruses are utilizing optimized lentivirus or retrovirus pseudotyping system, while there is no common pseudotyping system for nonenveloped viruses.",

Similar strategies had been applied based on our experiences in previously established EV71 single round infection system . CVB3 sub-genomic replicon plasmid (CVB3 replicon) contains untranslated regions (UTRs), firefly luciferase (luc) reporter gene and all nonstructural protein regions, with a T7 promoter sequence at the upstream of 5 end used for in vitro transcription. The capsid expressing plasmid, which is designated as EGFP CVB3 (Nancy) Capsid Expresser, contains all the structural genes (VP1-4) and an EGFP reporter gene that are under control of a CMV promoter (Fig. 1A) . A 2A protease cleavage sequence (AITTL) which was from EV71 genome were introduced both in CVB3 replicon (between luciferase gene and nonstructural genes) and EGFP CVB3 (Nancy) Capsid Expresser (between EGFP gene and capsid). Efficient protease cleavage upon viral polyprotein translation in these two sites was required for viral proteins maturation and pseudovirus encapsidation. The single round pseudovirus was produced by sequential transfection of the capsid expressing plasmid and CVB3 sub-genomic RNA transcribed from CVB3 replicon in vitro (see Section 2). The produced virus is designated as CVB3 (Nancy)-luc. These pseudoviruses can only infect cells once as they lack structural genes and their capsid was provided in producing cell in trans. Successful production of high titer CVB3 pseudovirus showed that inserted 2A sequence from EV71 could be efficiently recognized by CVB3 viral proteases.",

Bland-Altman method comparison analysis further showed that these two methods were highly consistent. The average of logarithmic difference for quantitative results of the two methods was 0.7157, and the standard deviation was 0.3193 (Fig. 3D) .",

Although unpaired t test analysis showed that the difference in titer of these two groups was not statistically significant, the geometric mean titers were slightly higher in adults group (Fig. 4) .

In our previous work, we found CA16 could be pseudotyped with EV71 replicon with moderate efficiency; however CVB3 failed to be pseudotyped (Fig. S3) . So we established a CVB3 single round infection system with high titers using CVB3 replicon, and found that neither EV71 nor CA16 could be pseudotyped with CVB3 replicon (Fig. S3 ). Different compatibility among picornaviruses suggested that there might be encapsidation signal either on replicon RNA or in trans provided capsid proteins or both, and common determinants might be found if viruses were classified into categories according to their pseudotyping compatibility.",

After successful development of effective inactivated whole-virus EV71 vaccines, EV71 infection cases would drop significantly in the future, while CVB3 might be a prominent enterovirus replacing EV71. Serological investigation of neutralizing antibodies in the population would allow us to assess the protection level against viral infections. In this work, we also did a small scale serological survey of CVB3 in health adults, and compared CVB3 seroprevalence in pre-school children and adults. The existence of neutralizing antibodies reflects previous infections. The higher positive rate of CVB3 neutralizing antibodies in adults indicates that there have been CVB3 infections during childhood. Despite the different geographic sampling, the serological pattern is the same as the investigation in Yantai city of China (Tao et al., 2013) . Low positive rate of CVB3 neutralizing antibodies in infants indicated these infants were na\u00efve to CVB3 and with higher risk in potential CVB3 outbreaks. Not only CVB3, but also many enteroviruses including EV71, CA16, CA6 have been reported with higher positive rate and titers of neutralizing antibodies in adults, while low positive rate in infants or pre-school children which makes them susceptible to enteroviruses infection (Ji et al., 2012; Ang et al., 2015) .",

Taken together, we propose that neutralizing antibodies against EV71 and CVB3 can be measured simultaneously. We next would substitute firefly luciferase reporter in CVB3 replicon with renilla luciferase reporter, and use both our previously developed EV71 pseudovirus expressing firefly luciferase and CVB3 pseudovirus expressing renilla luciferase to measure neutralizing antibodies against each virus in the same well (Duel pseudovirus expressing luciferase reporter system). This would further minimize the cost and required clinical serum volume in practice. Many enteroviruses have been found to be associated with HFMD in previous HFMD surveillance; multivalent vaccine may be needed for more effective HFMD control . Assays with the capacity to evaluate neutralizing antibodies to multiple pathogens simultaneously would be preferred in the future.",

Luciferase activities were measured at 12 h post infection. Each data point represents the average of eight replicates. Linear regression analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism. Points that beyond the linear range were excluded. (C) Spearman correlation analysis of CVB3 neutralizing antibodies titers in human serum samples measured both by CPE assay and pseudovirus assay. 46 pre-school children serum samples were considered positive in both assays. As titers of two samples were beyond the measurable range of CPE assay (titers >1024), titers of the other 44 samples were used in the following analysis.
