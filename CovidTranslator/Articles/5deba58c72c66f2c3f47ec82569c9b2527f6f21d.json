F4 is a fusion protein comprising HIV-1 antigens p17 and p24, reverse transcriptase and Nef. This study assessed the toxicity, biodistribution and shedding profiles of MV1-F4. Cynomolgus macaques were intramuscularly immunized one or three times with the highest dose of MV1-F4 intended for clinical use, the reference (Schwarz) measles vaccine or saline, and monitored clinically for 11 or 85 days. Toxicological parameters included local and systemic clinical signs, organ weights, haematology, clinical and gross pathology and histopathology. Both vaccines were well tolerated, with no morbidity, clinical signs or gross pathological findings observed. Mean spleen weights were increased after three doses of either vaccine, which corresponded with increased numbers and/or sizes of germinal centers. This was likely a result of the immune response to the vaccines. Either vaccine virus replicated preferentially in secondary lymphoid organs and to a lesser extent in epithelium-rich tissues (e.g., intestine, urinary bladder and trachea) and the liver. At the expected peak of viremia, viral RNA was detected in some biological fluid samples from few animals immunized with either vaccine, but none of these samples contained infectious virus. In conclusion, no shedding of infectious viral particles was identified in cynomolgus monkeys after injection of MV1-F4 or Schwarz measles vaccines. Furthermore, no toxic effect in relation to the MV vaccination was found with these vaccines in this study.",

During the past two decades, significant efforts have been made to develop such a vaccine. Among the few candidate HIV-1 vaccines tested in large Phase IIb or III clinical trials, only the RV144 trial, evaluating a recombinant canarypox vector prime and HIV-1 gp120 protein boost, showed a modest efficacy (31 %) against HIV-1 acquisition (reviewed by McElrath and Haynes 2010; McMichael et al. 2010) . Although ultimately, a preventive vaccine against HIV-1 inducing sterile immunity would be optimal, vaccines that would reduce viral load and disease progression by induction of strong and polyfunctional T cell responses should also prove beneficial (McMichael et al. 2010) .",

Besides being highly efficacious, these vaccines are also recognized as safe (WHO 2009) , as MV replicates in the cytoplasm and does not integrate into the host cell genome. Moreover, reversion of the vaccine genome into a pathogenic form has never been observed. The experience accumulated with these vaccines in the past 50 years, and their capacity to induce both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, render recombinant MV vectors an attractive platform for vaccines aimed to induce T cell responses specific for the HIV-1 transgene. For several of these vaccines expressing HIV-1 antigens, the immunogenicity has been preclinically demonstrated (Combredet et al. 2003; Guerbois et al. 2009; Liniger et al. 2009; Lorin et al. 2004) .",

The resulting toxicity and biodistribution profiles, including any target organs identified, could be used to guide clinical safety monitoring, while the shedding profile is crucial for determining the potential of infectious viral dissemination by future vaccine recipients, and thus of person-to-person transmission of the virus.

In addition, we hypothesized that both vaccine viruses have the potential to spread into a large variety of organs, as attenuated MV strains can use the CD46 receptor (which is ubiquitously expressed in both humans and cynomolgus macaques; Sakurai et al. 2008) , in addition to the receptors used by wild-type MV (Dorig et al. 1993) . Wildtype MV strains use primarily the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM/CD150) expressed on certain immune cells, and likely other low-affinity receptors to enter CD150-negative epithelial cells (Tatsuo et al. 2000b; Watanabe et al. 2010) . As a result, these strains replicate predominantly in lymphoid organs and epithelial tissues (Griffin 2007; Takeda 2008) .

This vector contains an infectious MV cDNA corresponding to the anti-genome of the Schwarz MV vaccine strain. An additional transcription unit (ATU) was inserted into pTM-MV-Schw in order to sub-clone the F4 fusion protein sequence. F4 has been described previously (Van Braeckel et al. 2011 ) and comprises HIV-1 subtype B antigens p24 (BH10), RT (HXB2), Nef (Bru-Lai) and p17 (BH10). The ATU contains a cloning-site cassette inserted into a copy of the original N-P intergenic region of the MV genome. This region contains the cis-acting sequences required for transcription of the viral P gene, enabling the recombinant MV to express the F4 protein like a measles gene. The ATU was introduced into the plasmid backbone by site-directed mutagenesis between the MV P and M genes, resulting in the plasmid pTM-MVSchw-ATU2_F4co_mut. MV1-F4 virus was rescued from the pTM-MVSchw-ATU2_F4co_mut plasmid using a helper cell-based system developed at the Institut Pasteur. Briefly, helper HEK293 cells expressing both the T7-RNA polymerase and the Schwarz MV N and P proteins were co-transfected with the pTM-MVSchw-ATU2_F4co_mut cDNA and a plasmid expressing the Schwarz MV polymerase L. Subsequently, transfected HEK293-T7-MV helper cells were gently harvested and co-cultured with MRC-5 cells for the amplification of the MV1-F4 virus. Virus titers were determined by endpoint titration on Vero cells and were expressed as 50 % cell culture infectious dose (CCID 50 )/ml.",

Animals were inoculated and monitored at the laboratories of the Centre International de Toxicologie (CIT; Evreux, France). Of the 42 monkeys included in the study, 18 young males and 18 young females were allocated to treatment groups 1-6 (Table 1) . Animals were allocated to groups (by sex) using a computerized randomization procedure (CITOX software, developed in-house at CIT, Evreux, France). In addition, six sexually mature males (three per group) were allocated to treatment groups 7 and 8 using the same randomization procedure, and were only used for collection of semen and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as for selected clinical observations (body weight, body temperature and food consumption). Treatments included 3.9 \u00d7 10 3 CCID 50 of Rouvax, 1.6 \u00d7 10 4 CCID 50 of MV1-F4 vaccine, or saline, and were administered according to either a one-dose schedule (injection at day 1) or a three-dose schedule (injections at days 1, 29 and 57). Monkeys were monitored clinically until sacrifice (groups 1-6) or until return to laboratory stock at day 85 (groups 7 and 8). Upon completion of the observation period, animals of groups 1-6 were sedated with ketamine hydrochloride (Imalg\u00e8ne, M\u00e9rial, Lyon, France), then anesthetized with thiopental and sacrificed by exsanguination. Necropsy was performed at two time-points, either within the expected peak of viremia (10 days after the first vaccine dose (day 11) for groups 1-3) or when clearance of infectious MV was expected to have occurred (represented by 28 days after the third dose [day 85] for groups 4-6) (Auwaerter et al. 1999; Pan et al. 2005; Permar et al. 2003) . Single-and repeated-dose toxicity was assessed at various time points (Table 2 ). Shedding and post-mortem analyses were conducted at Texcell (Evry, France).

MV1-F4 RNA recovery was assessed by N-specific RT-qPCR after spiking each type of tissue with MV1-F4 at various concentrations, and ranged from 90 % to 100 %. The presence of MV1-F4 RNA was considered positive if the measurements exceeded the limit of detection (LOD) of 100 geq/reaction, and if the acceptance criteria (error <0.2, efficiency>90 % and crossing point <45) were fulfilled. The LOD was defined as the lowest amount of copies that can be detected (but not necessarily quantified as an exact value) with 95 % probability. All samples were tested once.",

This enlargement was primarily due to generation of germinal centers, and was also noted in the animals sacrificed on day 85 (in one of the three MV1-F4treated males and two of the three Rouvax-treated males). At both time points, the increased sizes of the white pulp and/or germinal centers were not necessarily linked to the detection of viral RNA in the spleens. In addition, no enlargement was observed in some animals for which viral RNA was detected in the spleen. Furthermore, minimally increased germinal center sizes and/or numbers were occasionally noted in mandibular lymph nodes in two of the three MV1-F4treated males sacrificed on day 11. Although this was also seen in one of three control females sacrificed on day 85, a relationship to treatment could not be excluded. This effect was rarely seen in iliac, cervical or popliteal lymph nodes. The higher absolute and relative weights of cervical and iliac lymph nodes recorded in males of both vaccine groups on day 85 did not correlate with any consistent microscopic changes.",

Furthermore, no toxic effect in relation to the MV vaccination was found with these vaccines. One or three IM injections of a full human dose of MV1-F4 or of the reference vaccine were well tolerated and induced no clinical symptoms of local or systemic reactogenicity. For both vaccines, virus replication was predominantly observed in secondary lymphoid organs (including spleens, Peyer's patches and all major lymph nodes) and to a lesser extent in epithelium-rich tissues (including intestine, larynx, trachea and urinary bladder) and liver, which were thus designated as potential target organs for intrinsic toxicity of the vaccines. However, no gross or histopathological effects indicative of toxicity were observed in these target organs, or in any other organs. Mean spleen weights were increased after three doses of either vaccine, which corresponded in some animals with enlargements of the white pulp, due to generation or growth of germinal centers. This effect likely resulted from immune activation of the secondary lymphoid organs by the vaccines, which has also been observed in other preclinical studies (Sheets et al. 2006; Speijers et al. 1988) . It is less likely that local virus replication in these organs has caused the increased spleen weights, as no clear relationship between increased spleen weights, enlargements of the white pulp and the presence of viral RNA in the spleens could be established. All other observations were considered to be unrelated to treatment, as they occurred incidentally, without correlation between genders, or at similar frequencies in control and immunized animals.",

However, shortening of the aPTT has generally little clinical relevance and may be associated with suboptimal sample collection or processing (Adcock et al. 1998; Awad et al. 2006) . Therefore this is not considered indicative of coagulation abnormalities of toxicological relevance. We also observed that on day 85, the mean CK activity for Rouvax-treated males was significantly higher than for control males. Elevated CK values are used as a marker of injury, heart attack, severe muscle breakdown, muscular dystrophy or acute renal failure (Lott and Abbott 1986) . None of these conditions were observed for the two males involved, and urinalysis showed no treatment-related effect for either vaccine. In addition, no elevated CK activity was found in these animals on previous time points. Possibly these elevations reflect the effects of IM-delivered sedation for ophthalmology on day 84. This effect is commonly seen in preclinical studies (Stewart et al. 2008 ) and is therefore not considered to be an adverse reaction to treatment.",

            "text": "Cell tropism for vaccine and wild-type MV strains is largely determined by virus entry (Tatsuo et al. 2000a ). Wild-type MV, which use predominantly SLAM/CD150 expressed on activated immune cells (Tatsuo et al. 2000b) , is known to mainly replicate in lymphoid organs and epithelial tissues such as the skin, respiratory tract, intestine and urinary bladder (Griffin 2007; Takeda 2008) . Recent studies suggest that after aerosol infection, wild-type MV initially targets macrophages and dendritic cells in alveolar tissues, which is followed by replication in regional lymph nodes and systemic spreading to lymphoid organs (Lemon et al. 2011) . How MV infects CD150-negative epithelial cells remains largely unclear, although putative epithelial receptors have recently been described (Watanabe et al. 2010) . As MV vaccine strains use the ubiquitous CD46 receptor in addition to the receptors used by wild-type MV (Dorig et al. 1993) , the vaccine strains were expected to exhibit a wider tropism than that documented previously for wild-type MV (Griffin 2007; Lemon et al. 2011; Takeda 2008) . However, in macaques infected intratracheally or by aerosol with wild-type or attenuated (Edmonston tag) recombinant MV, only the pathogenic MV caused significant viremia and widespread distribution. The attenuated MV had a restricted systemic spread and was rarely detected in lymphoid tissues (de Vries et al. 2010) , in contrast to observations in the current study. Our data seem to be more aligned with studies in mice immunized intraperitoneally or intravenously with an attenuated oncolytic (Edmonston) recombinant strain, in which infected cells were mainly detected in secondary lymphoid organs, liver and lungs (Myers et al. 2007; Peng et al. 2003) . These disparities between studies may be explained by differences in administration routes, MV strains or methods of MV detection.",

The few known studies of shedding by attenuated MV vectors report detection of (Edmonston) viral RNA in buccal swabs from monkeys (after intravenous administration; Myers et al. 2007 ), but no detection in human urine or saliva (after intraperitoneal administration; Galanis et al. 2010) . Consistent with reports of detection of viral RNA from attenuated MV vaccine strains in human urine up to 14 days after vaccination (Rota et al. 1995) , we detected MV1-F4-derived RNA in urine at day 11. Infectious viral particles from MV vaccines have rarely been found in human throat or nasopharyngeal secretions, and there is only one reported case of isolation of (Schwarz) MV vaccine virus from throat swabs (Morfin et al. 2002) . While we detected viral RNA from both vaccines at the peak of viremia in a few samples such as throat and nasopharingal swabs, none of these contained infectious virus at a LOD of 10 CCID 50 /well (with 95 % probability).

Moreover, either vaccine virus replicated predominantly in secondary lymphoid organs and, to a lesser extent, in epithelium-rich tissues. Thus, as expected, introduction of the F4 transgene did not change the toxicological profile, shedding capacity or tropism of the parental strain.",
