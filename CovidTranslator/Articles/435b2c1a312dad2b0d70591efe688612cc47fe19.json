Currently, there are no effective treatments or vaccines available to control PDCoV. To study the potential of RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against PDCoV infection, two short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing plasmids (pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N) that targeted the M and N genes of PDCoV were constructed and transfected separately into swine testicular (ST) cells, which were then infected with PDCoV strain HB-BD. The potential of the plasmids to inhibit PDCoV replication was evaluated by cytopathic effect, virus titers, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay. The cytopathogenicity assays demonstrated that pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N protected ST cells against pathological changes with high specificity and efficacy. The 50% tissue culture infective dose showed that the PDCoV titers in ST cells treated with pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N were reduced 13.2-and 32.4-fold, respectively. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR also confirmed that the amount of viral RNA in cell cultures pre-transfected with pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N was reduced by 45.8 and 56.1%, respectively. This is believed to be the first report to show that shRNAs targeting the M and N genes of PDCoV exert antiviral effects in vitro, which suggests that RNAi is a promising new strategy against PDCoV infection.",

When the degree of monolayer cell confluence reached 70-80%, transfection was started according to the manufacturer's instructions of LipoGene\u2122 2000 plus transfection reagent (US Everbright lnc., San Francisco, US). Briefly, 2 \u03bcg of transfection reagent was diluted with 50 \u03bcL of Opti-MEM and stand for 5 min at room temperature, then mixed with 50 \u03bcL diluted shRNAexpressing plasmid (1 \u03bcg shRNA-expressing plasmid was diluted with 50 \u03bcL of Opti-MEM). After 20 min, the cells of each well were washed three times and overlaid with 100 \u03bcL of the transfection mixture. The cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C, and the medium was changed. After 24 h, the cells were infected with 100 TCID 50 PDCoV. ST cells infected with PDCoV but had undergone the transfection procedure without plasmid DNA added served as mock-transfected controls. Expression vector pGenesil-1 encodes the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Therefore, EGFP expression in a cell line can be used as a In this study, we used inverted fluorescence microscopy to capture images to evaluate the cell transfection efficiency and CPE.",

In this study, we designed two shRNAs based on the theoretically valid sequences of the M and N genes of PDCoV with nucleotide positions of 328-346 (M) and 270-288 (N), and established three shRNA recombinant expression plasmids to study whether shRNA-mediated RNAi inhibited PDCoV replication in vitro. To guarantee a similar RNAi effect on different PDCoV strains, the two theoretically effective sequences were analyzed by BLAST to ensure that they did not have any similar sequences in the swine genome, but shared 100% similarity with the published sequences of different PDCoV strains. Both the shRNAs inhibited PDCoV replication in ST cells. The interference properties were revealed by reductions in CPE formation, virus TCID 50 titers, and viral RNA copy numbers in the infected cells. The CPE and TCID 50 assay of pGenesil-M-and pGenesil-N-transfected cells showed viral suppression 48 h after infection and the titers of pGenesil-M-and pGenesil-N-transfected cells were reduced 13.2-and 32.4fold, respectively. The real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay showed that the viral RNA copy number was reduced by 45.8% in pGenesil-M-transfected cells and 56.1% in pGenesil-M-transfected cells. The inhibitory efficiency of pGenesil-N was higher than that of pGenesil-M. Although the interference efficiency of shRNAs against PDCoV in our study was lower than that of the shRNAs targeting other coronaviruses [15, 17] , these results indicate that RNAi against PDCoV mediated by shRNAs can inhibit PDCoV replication in vitro. A disadvantage of this transient transfection/expression system is that virus replication can be inhibited only in cells that are expressing the shRNA, and cells not expressing the shRNA can be infected. Therefore, one explanation for the lower interference efficiency of shRNAs against PDCoV in this study compared to shRNAs targeting other coronaviruses in other studies could be lower transfection efficiency of the shRNA expression plasmids.",
