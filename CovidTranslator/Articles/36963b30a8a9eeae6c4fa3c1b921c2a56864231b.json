Lower respiratory tract infections have been estimated to cause over 4 million deaths a year (range 3.6-4.4 million), of which approximately 40% are caused by respiratory viruses (Global Burden of Disease Collaborators, 2018) . The emergence of high morbidity viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2004, influenza A(H5N1) in 2005, Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and influenza A(H7N9) in 2013, as well as discovery of novel viral pathogens such as human metapneumovirus in 2001 and human bocavirus in 2005 have highlighted the importance of international collaboration on respiratory virus research for their prevention and control. The International Society for Influenza and other Respiratory Viruses Diseases (isirv) is an independent international scientific professional society promoting the prevention, detection, treatment, and control of influenza and other respiratory virus diseases. The Antiviral Group is a special interest group of isirv (isirv-AVG) with specific objectives to promote the understanding and development of antivirals against respiratory viruses, and to collate and provide up to date information on the emergence of antiviral resistance to the established therapeutics. It also aims to provide information on the evaluation of resistance to new therapies under development. To communicate advances in preclinical and clinical development of potent novel antivirals five previous conferences have been organized by the isirv-AVG.",

BARDA is supporting work to improve diagnostics with the goal of recognizing illness before any symptoms develop. This may include wearable diagnostics or biosensors. The high mortality associated with human infections with novel coronaviruses MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and avian influenza strains (influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9)) have raised questions about the possible role of a dysregulated immune response, a so called \"cytokine storm\", in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory disease. As some patients may not respond to typical anti-pathogen therapeutics (e.g. antivirals), BARDA is pursuing therapeutics which target the host in order to modify the immune/host response. More work needs to be done to identify these host targets and develop therapeutics towards the dysregulated immune response. The field also needs better diagnostics to guide treatment as over-suppression of the immune response can be just as dangerous as over-stimulation.",

BARDA has historically seen a role in mitigating the risk of advanced development; however, all vested parties need to come together to find ways to mitigate the risk of sustainability.",

            "text": "Stefanie Vogel, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA. Induction of acute lung injury caused by infection can occur due to the cytokine storm resulting from the activation of the inflammatory response. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern recognition receptor and its prototype \"pathogen-associated molecular pattern\" (PAMP) is gram-negative bacteria endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TLR4 has been implicated in the pathology associated with other infections as well as tissue damage caused by non-infectious insults. The TLR4 signaling pathway is activated by LPS binding initially to CD14, which transfers the LPS to a non-covalently associated TLR4 co-receptor, MD2. LPS binding to MD2 leads to TLR4 dimerization and activation. The Vogel laboratory previously showed that TLR4-null mice were highly resistant to infection by the mouse-adapted influenza A/PR/8/ 34(H1N1) [PR8] strain (Shirey et al., 2013) , providing the rationale that blocking TLR4 signaling might be protective against influenza infection. Eritoran, a structural analog of LPS, functions as a TLR4 antagonist by binding to MD2, thereby preventing the interaction of LPS with MD2. Eritoran was demonstrated to have therapeutic benefit in the context of protection against acute lung injury in experimental murine and cotton rat models of influenza infection. Administration of eritoran once daily for 5 consecutive days to wild-type mice starting 2 days after PR8 infection resulted in highly significant protection against lethality and improved lung pathology. Moreover, a significant degree of survival was observed even when eritoran was administered to PR8-infected mice starting as late as day 6 post-infection. Protection against influenza infection was confirmed using other TLR4 antagonists including an anti-TLR4-specific antibody, TLR4 cell-permeable decoy peptides, a structural analog antagonist (FP7), and the small molecule TLR4 antagonist, TAK242 (Perrin-Cocon et al., 2017; Piao et al., 2015) . Eritoran was also protective in cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) infected with non-adapted human influenza A and B strains.",

Infection of mice or cotton rats with influenza causes the release of HMGB1, a host-derived protein that has been shown to be a TLR4 agonist and is released from dying cells. The administration of eritoran blocks release of HMGB1 and blunts influenza-induced cytokine induction which, in turn, results in improved lung function, reversal of edema, and reduced viral titer. Moreover, administration of an HMGB1 small molecule antagonist provides the same degree of protection to PR8-infected mice as eritoran.",

The rationale for targeting the host rather than virus is that the host is less likely to develop resistance to the therapeutic. Furthermore, as viruses can utilize common host molecular pathways, a number of different viruses could be potentially targeted by a single therapeutic. By utilizing therapeutics that have already been approved, or have completed phase 2 or 3 clinical trials for their initial indication, it would reduce the regulatory burden and lower development costs. Clinical gene expression signature data obtained from hospitalized influenza-positive patients was used to screen for potential drug candidates. During an infection the virus will modify cellular expression to create an environment that will facilitate translation and replication of the virus. The goal was to find a drug that can reverse this process and create an environment within the host that is unfavorable for the virus.",

The influenza virus infection signatures were then screened against the ConnectivityMap Database (Broad Institute, MIT). ConnectivityMap harbors more than 7000 transcriptomic profiles of different cell lines treated with 1300 small molecules. Candidate drugs were included if there was a negative correlation (-0.8 and \u22121) along with additional screening that considered criteria such as toxicity and delivery methods.

The treatment options are limited for patients that have been diagnosed with influenza when they are outside the window for effective treatment using antivirals. Lung injury and inflammation are the primary drivers of severe disease during influenza infection and also set up conditions for secondary infection, they are a new focus for treatment options. The acute lung injury that occurs as a result of pneumonia is driven by a number of mediators, including innate immune cells such as macrophages and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMP-9 is associated both with lung development and diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) where it has a role in remodeling. Digestion of collagen by MMP's generate short tripeptides (PGP acetylated) that serve as matrikines (extracellular matrix-derived peptides which regulate cell activity) and these bind to the IL-8 receptor causing neutrophils to enter the lung (Gaggar et al., 2008) . Digestion of the extracellular matrix and remodeling that occurs in the lung and transmigration of immune cells into the interstitial spaces and air spaces are both important in driving the biology of a number of infections. Preliminary work using samples taken from a cohort study at Brigham and Women's hospital showed that patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and enrolled with pneumonia with a pO 2 less than 80 mmHg and required supplemental O 2 had elevated levels of MMP-9, even more pronounced in those patients with seasonal and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. This was also shown to occur in mice as well. A related serendipitous observation demonstrated inhibiting MMP-9 was protective in a mouse model for influenza exacerbation in COPD. These observations provided the impetus to identify candidate therapeutics that target MMP-9 for use as potential treatment options.",

The conserved influenza HA stem region that is necessary for receptor attachment and fusion was used as a test case to compare minibinders with the traditional antibody format. The physiochemical properties of the minibinders (Fleishman et al., 2011) and manufacturability (Chevalier et al., 2017) have significantly improved in recent years. Minibinder (A13) is a small protein (40 amino acid) that binds with high affinity and has improved physiochemical properties where it is stable at temperatures up to 80\u00b0C.

Influenza viruses can cause severe infections correlated with an intense inflammatory response characterized by the secretion of cytokines, influx of neutrophils, and lung damage that can lead to death. Neutrophil activation and migration are orchestrated by different stimuli like platelet activating factor (PAF) and its receptor PAFR; the chemokine CXCL8 (CXCL1/2 in mice) and its receptor CXCR1/2; the anaphylatoxin C5a and others. The aim of this investigation was to test 4 potential pharmacological strategies modulating the host inflammatory response using compounds with different targets involved in neutrophil activation and migration for their ability to improve disease outcomes in murine influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infection models. Key measurements in the reported studies include assessing neutrophil cell counts in the BALF and lungs of infected mice, viral and/ or bacterial loads, histopathology scores in the lungs, weight loss, and lethality rates. For the first target, PAFR, a PAFR antagonist, (PCA 4248 from ToCris Bioscience Co.), given by oral gavage twice a day from day 3 to day 7 after infection reduced weight loss and protected mice from lethal influenza infection improving survival by 40 percent at day 21. PCA 4248 reduced neutrophil transmigration to the airways and consequent lung pathology at days 5 and 7 after infection. For the second target, C5a, a tick saliva derived protein that blocks C5 cleavage into C5a (OmCl), was given intraperitoneally from day 0 to day 5. OmCl was able to reduce C5a levels, which reduces neutrophil transmigration to airways, release of neutrophil extracellular traps and consequent lung pathology after influenza A infection.",

Treatment with DF2162 during influenza infection was reported to reduce neutrophil transmigration to airways and consequent lung pathology after influenza infection. In addition, DF2162 given from day 3 to day 7 after influenza infection protected mice from secondary (14 days after influenza) Streptococcus pneumoniae morbidity by reduction of neutrophil infiltration in the lungs and bacteremia in mice. In a fourth approach, the use of steroids during influenza infection was examined. The corticosteroid dexamethasone was given alone or in combination with suboptimal doses of oseltamivir starting at day 0 or day 3 until day 10 after infection. Reduced lethality was observed when dexamethasone was given therapeutically (initiated at day 3 post-infection) but not when given prophylactically (Day 0). In all cases, the ability of the host to deal with the infection seen by lymphocyte numbers and/or viral titers in the lungs was unchanged. In conclusion, these compounds targeting different steps of neutrophil activation and migration have an important therapeutic potential that should be investigated in humans.",

One approach is to directly target host factors involved in essential viral functions without causing major effects to the host cell. The influenza A virus genome contains 8 vRNA segments. vRNA segment 7 codes for the matrix protein M1 which has splice variants. M1 mRNA is also alternatively spliced to encode the M2 ion channel. It has previously been shown that post-transcriptional splicing of the fulllength M1 mRNA occurs at nuclear speckles, which are specialized storage sites for splicing factors inside the nucleus. M1 and M2 mRNAs are then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation. The M1 and M2 proteins are necessary for viral trafficking and generation of new viral particles. Since most cellular mRNAs are not spliced at nuclear speckles, inhibiting the splicing of the viral M mRNA presents a possible avenue for development of new classes of antiviral inhibitors. A high throughput chemical screen was performed starting with 232,500 compounds to identify small molecule effectors of viral mRNA splicing and nuclear export using a multistep approach. Compounds showing strong inhibition of M mRNA splicing and nuclear export but no activity toward bulk poly(A) RNA nuclear export and no toxicity to host cells were identified. Two influenza inhibitors were identified with different phenotypes. One compound inhibited a subset of influenza strains while the other presented broad antiviral activity and provided a promising lead for further drug development.",

VH244 is modeled on defective interfering influenza viral particles that occur in nature and typically contain a highly deleted form of the viral genome which are unable to replicate. VH244 is being developed for the treatment of multiple respiratory viral infections. The effective moiety is derived from segment 1 of influenza A and is a truncated 395 nucleotide RNA packaged within a viral particle derived from influenza A PR8 (H1N1). VH244 enters host cells efficiently but results in a non-productive infection because it cannot replicate, lacking a full-length segment 1 encoding an essential component of the RNA polymerase complex. VH244 significantly reduces replication of respiratory viruses in vitro by two separate mechanisms of action: 1) a pan-respiratory viral infection activity against other respiratory viruses including influenza B, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), RSV, and human rhinovirus (HRV) through stimulation of host innate immunity and activation of the cell antiviral state and 2) against influenza A through genomic interference.",

Potent and selective M2-1 chemical inhibitors were identified after a series of elegant mode of action studies with RSV reporter constructs, a mutant RSV virus with a single point mutation in M2-1, and evaluation of a series of chemical probes based on cyclopamine. Cyclopamine is a steroidal alkaloid and smoothened receptor (Smo) antagonist which inhibits RSV replication, but it also has undesirable off-target effects interacting with the hedgehog pathway which impacts important biological processes of the host cell. To address this issue, chemical analogues of cyclopamine were designed using the structure of cyclopamine-Smo, were synthesized and tested to determine if the anti-RSV activity [RSV(+)] could be separated from the unwanted Smo-mediated signaling activity. The compounds were tested for inhibition of essential functions in RSV replication such as the formation of inclusion body associated granules (IBAGS). Time-of-addition studies with cyclopamine showed that it targets the post-entry phase of viral replication, reduces transcription of downstream genes in RSV replication and IBAG formation is disrupted. Several Smo(\u2212)/RSV(+) molecules were identified and were able to specifically suppress RSV lung infection in the mouse model in a dosedependent and M2-1-specific manner. Target validation studies of the M2-1 were conducted using the RSV mini-replicon system, reverse genetics of recombinant RSV expressing the luciferase reporter gene and a mutant RSV virus with a single R151K mutation in M2-1. Chemical analog data showed that the hedgehog and RSV activities of cyclopamine can be dissociated, paving the way for development of new molecular entities targeting M2-1 based on the cyclopamine scaffold.",

FDA guidance suggests \"For seriously ill influenza patients requiring hospitalization, a primary endpoint should include clinical signs and symptoms, duration of hospitalization, time to normalization of vital signs and oxygenation, requirements for supplemental oxygen or assisted ventilation, and mortality\" (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2011). To meet this requirement, prior studies have evaluated different endpoints. Of 10 trials identified in a population hospitalized with influenza, 4 used an ordinal scale as the primary endpoint, 5 used time to clinical resolution, and 1 used resolution of tachypnea or hypoxia. The endpoint of resolution of tachypnea or hypoxia was noted to have significant variation throughout the day with 10% of study participants resolving the hypoxia after randomization and prior to treatment (Beigel et al., 2017) . The time to clinical resolution is often driven by 1 measurement. In the case of peramivir, this was largely driven by resolution of fever (de Jong et al., 2014) which ultimately doesn't meet the FDA requirement for focusing on how a patient functions. Therefore, more recently sponsors have turned their attention to using an ordinal scale, such as clinical status on Day 7. This endpoint is clinically meaningful, minimizes variation, but has not yet been successfully used in pivotal studies.",

The choice of endpoints for therapeutic studies in respiratory viral diseases will depend on the clinical setting and population studied. Prior guidance from the FDA has noted a \"single best endpoint has not been identified in seriously ill hospitalized patients\" and \"sponsors are encouraged to provide evidence for the ability of their proposed endpoint to directly measure how a patient feels, functions, or survives\" (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2011). In order to construct these endpoints, we need to better categorize severity of disease in those hospitalized with a respiratory virus. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was developed in the United Kingdom for identifying patients at risk for deterioration or escalation of care. Several studies have used or proposed using NEWS to define a population with severe influenza, but this score has not been validated for this purpose. A retrospective study was conducted at Northwestern University Hospital evaluating 315 patients hospitalized with influenza, and were categorized by NEWS (1-3, 4-6, > 6) and an ordinal scale of clinical outcomes (death, in the ICU on a mechanical ventilator, in the ICU but not on a mechanical ventilator, hospitalized on supplemental oxygen, hospitalized not on supplemental oxygen, discharge but has not resumed normal activities, and discharged with resumption of normal activities). Prior studies had demonstrated early treatment led to better clinical outcomes, and this was used as a surrogate for therapeutic benefit from antivirals in the current analysis. When analyzed using an ordinal scale endpoint, a higher baseline NEWS was associated with greater but later therapeutic benefit from neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) based treatment. However, recruitment may be affected as there were fewer numbers of patients as the NEWS increased (Ison, 2016) .",

To evaluate a positive and clinically meaningful effect of a treatment in hospitalized patients with influenza or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), it is essential to consider how a patient feels, functions or survives. Such feedback may impact approval decisions by the FDA and can provide important information for labeling. These clinical outcome assessments (COAs) include different tools to collect subjective feedback, including a patient-reported outcome (PRO), a clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO), an observer-reported outcome (ObsRO), or a performance outcome (PerfRO). In addition to standardized forms, data from digital health technology can also be used to collect COAs. Regardless of the type of COA used, it should be appropriate for its intended use (patient population, study design); it should have fit-forpurpose concepts that can be reliably measured; are clinically important and valuable to the patients; and can be communicated in labeling in a way that is accurate, interpretable and well-defined. To assist in this process, the FDA published the Guidance for Industry When planning to use a COA in hospitalized patients with influenza or SARI, the selected endpoint should be considered, and a decision made as to whether a particular PRO is the best tool, or whether another COA should be selected. Additional considerations when choosing a COA include: Whether one COA can be used to measure recovery during and after discharge? Can the same COA be used across cultures and languages? Is it reproducible within and across raters? To assist in answering these questions, the FDA has developed several pathways for assessment, review and advice, whether the planned development program is for an individual drug; or for the development of novel COAs for use in multiple programs. One pathway is the Critical Path Innovation Meetings where, general non-binding advice can be sought on a specific methodology or technology in its early stages of development (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018). In conclusion, the FDA supports the development and implementation of patient COAs in clinical trials to support drug approvals and labeling claims and encourages early communication with the agency to provide advice on the selection, modification or development of appropriate COAs.",

Influenza is seasonal, meaning that for each season enrollment per clinical site is limited to approximately six weeks, with peak activity covering only two weeks on average. Additionally, more than one third of hospital clinical sites do not enroll a single patient and another quarter enroll only one or two subjects (Beigel et al., 2017; de Jong et al., 2014; Marty et al., 2017) . To facilitate adequate enrollment, a large number of sites across the globe are required to complete the study in a timely manner. However, global variability in clinical care and standard of care (SOC) poses considerable challenges to study design, interpretation, and generalizability. Another challenge occurs when enrollment spans multiple seasons making it difficult to compare across varying strains with differing clinical presentations. In addition, there is no agreed upon clinical endpoint for hospitalized influenza clinical studies. The poor correlation between a viral load and clinical symptoms, makes a clinical endpoint (rather than a virologic endpoint) more logical. However, the subjective nature of a clinical endpoint, along with variability in SOC requirements and regional differences in quality of healthcare makes it harder to determine the real effect of a treatment. Furthermore, in many countries, Institutional Review Boards (Ethics Committees) require that a hospital-based phase 3 clinical trial use SOC (oseltamivir) in addition to the investigational drug compared to SOC alone (Yang et al., 2012) . Therefore, investigational drugs must demonstrate superiority to oseltamivir to meet the endpoints for the study.",

The identification of broad-spectrum therapeutics that are effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of RSV and influenza infections would be beneficial as these viruses are responsible for the bulk of influenza-like illnesses. The approach taken to identify a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate was outlined. Initially, a high throughput screening (HTS) assay using a library containing 180,000 compounds was screened against a validated replication-competent influenza A virus (IAV) reporter virus. This screening yielded a broad spectrum ribonucleoside inhibitor (EIDD-1931) which has activity against RSV and influenza. EIDD-1931 was used in further rounds of testing against a panel of laboratory-adapted and clinical strains representing RSV, IAVs, and influenza B viruses (IBVs) in both established cell lines and primary human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells (HBTECs). It was shown that EIDD-1931 has activity against influenza A group 1 and 2 strains, including pathogenic avian influenza isolates and influenza B in sub-micromolar range. The putative mechanism of action is the induction of virus error catastrophe (inability to replicate as a result of excessive mutations). Experimental data shows that it has a high barrier against resistance as there were no resistant viruses identified after ten passages and deep sequencing of the virus populations.",

Initial dosing at 100 mg/kg either prophylactically or when administered 24 post exposure showed a reduction in viral load of several orders of magnitude in nasal lavages. EIDD-2801 was then dosed 24 h post infection at 20 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg and tested against influenza A group 1 and 2 strains and influenza B strains.

The goal of these studies was to ascertain if treating severely ill influenza positive patients with 3-fold increase in the oseltamivir dose would show clinical benefit. This was an open label study and 27 influenza-positive patients in an ICU on mechanical ventilation were randomized. The treatment groups consisted of 13 and 14 patients and they received either a double (150 mg) or a triple dose (225 mg) of oseltamivir, respectively. The primary outcome was the rate of viral clearance (day 5) with secondary outcome given as 28-day mortality. Most of the patients were influenza A positive with a bacterial coinfection and an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) severity score greater than 20. Some difficulties were encountered in recruiting patients due to high rates of renal failure. The results from the study showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in either the primary or secondary endpoints. A small difference in the viral load in the nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspirates was observed with the higher dose of oseltamivir, however this difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, there were no differences observed in the 28-day mortality.",

Baloxavir is a new class of therapeutic that targets the cap-dependent endonuclease of both influenza A and B viruses. The use of baloxavir in combination with NAIs may provide additional clinical benefit for resolving infection with influenza B virus. These studies were undertaken to assess if there is a synergistic effect on influenza B virus replication in vitro when the NAI and baloxavir were mixed at concentrations close to their EC 50 values. The experimental approach involved evaluating each compound individually with a cytopathic effect assay. The range of the of three NAI's EC 50 was 109.8-863.7 nmol/L and baloxavir was 14.7 nmol/L. Using the Chou and Talalay method, a combination index was generated, and based on this experimental data the observed effect was classified as additive for each of the NAIs. These data complement a previously published study that showed that there is a synergistic effect on influenza A virus replication when baloxavir is used in combination with NAI (Fukao et al., 2019) .",

A murine model was developed to recapitulate the chronic infections observed in immunocompromised patients, and test investigational and approved therapeutic agents. Genetically modified immunocompromised BALB scid mice infected with influenza B virus (B/Brisbane/60/2008) display susceptibility to infection and persistent viral replication recapitulating chronic infection. The efficacy of a representative NAI (peramivir) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor (favipiravir) was assessed using BALB/c and BALB scid mice (Pascua et al., 2017) . Starting 24 h post-infection, peramivir (75 mg/kg/day) was administered to mice intramuscularly (IM) once every other day with groups receiving single, double or quadruple doses. Favipiravir was administered orally 10, 50 or 250 mg/kg/day twice daily for 5 or 10 days. It was observed that most of the control BALB/c mice succumbed to infection while those treated with peramivir survived. For scid mice, 60% of those animals that received 2 or 4 doses of peramivir survived compare to 40% for the one-dose-treated group. Virus replication was examined in the lungs and nasal turbinates in the one-and two-dose groups. Peramivir suppressed virus replication in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) but required two treatments to suppress replication in the nasal turbinates in BALB/c mice. In contrast peramivir did not suppress viral replication in the turbinates or lungs of the scid mice. BALB/c mice treated with a 50 mg/kg/day dose of favipiravir significantly increased survival rates and suppressed viral replication in the lung. However, suppression of viral replication in the nasal turbinates was only observed in those animals dosed at 250 mg/ kg/day. For scid mice, administration of 50 and 250 mg/kg/day resulted in 100% survival and similar trends were observed in the effectiveness at suppressing viral replication in the nasal turbinates. Neither agent was able to suppress replication in the upper respiratory tract. The establishment of an immunocompromised murine models for influenza B virus infection will facilitate evaluations of the efficacy of currently available and investigational anti-influenza drugs in immunocompromised populations (Pascua et al., 2017) . 7.5. In vitro antiviral assessments of VIS410, a monoclonal antibody to influenza A virus, in combination with baloxavir and neuraminidase inhibitors Kristin Narayan, Visterra Inc., Waltham, MA, USA. VIS410 is a broadly active monoclonal antibody that binds the HA stalk of influenza A virus strains and is in clinical development for the treatment of critically ill hospitalized patients. VIS410 targets early steps of the infection cycle (fusion) by binding and neutralizing the virus, along with promoting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) activities. The antiviral activity of VIS410 was assessed both in the context of polymorphisms within the HA epitope and in combination with other approved antiviralsoseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir and baloxavir. To assess the impact of polymorphisms within the HA epitope the sequences of currently circulating strains, covering the years 2015 through 2017, were obtained from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GSAID) database. Approximately 40,000 influenza A H1 and H3 sequences were analyzed for changes in the VIS410 epitope. Mostly there were no changes in amino acid frequency that were above 2% at positions that comprise the VIS410 epitope. However, a change in the A(H1N1) HA at position HA2 45 from L to V was observed at low frequency in the last season. Full length HAs were cloned and expressed on the surface of 293 cells to facilitate binding analysis using flow cytometry. Cells expressing HA2 45 I, V or L did not show significant changes in VIS410 binding.",

There was improved antiviral activity of VIS410 when used in combination with baloxavir for influenza A H3N2 and H1N1 viruses. Likewise, the inclusion of VIS410 resulted in improvements in the antiviral activity of baloxavir when present at suboptimal levels close to the baloxavir antiviral EC 50 . A 3D synergy analysis showed that there was clear synergy between baloxavir and VIS410 against influenza A H3N2 and H1N1, with minor antagonism observed at the highest drug concentrations (which may represent a technical artifact caused by reaching maximum antiviral effect). Dosing with combinations of VIS410 and the individual NAIs (oseltamivir, peramivir and zanamivir) also showed some synergy or additive effects at the EC 50 of the individual compounds. 7.6.

The peptides were conjugated to a carrier protein known as Cross reacting material (CRM), a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin (DT). Peptide 11 CRM-conjugate vaccine was administered subcutaneously as a prime boost with live influenza A(H3N2) (Wuhan) administered intramuscularly at a dose of 10 6 . After priming with live influenza virus on Day 0 and 14, the mice were injected subcutaneously with 20-\u03bcg peptide 11 composite vaccine on days 30, 42, and 70. The immunological response was assessed using individual peptides and viruses including influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2). The initial immunologic response was low, but became more robust over time peaking at day 77. The second subunit vaccine (5906) is a composite vaccine that contains M2e peptide sequences, a tetanus T-cell epitope sequence, and is conjugated to CRM. This vaccine (50 \u03bcg) was administered subcutaneously with no prime boost and the mice were given boosts on days 21, 35 and 41. There was a robust immune response observed starting at day 21 and maximal at day 42. Based on the analytical results, it was concluded that the peptide composite vaccines are highly immunogenic and elicited strong humoral responses in mice. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) GA4 was isolated and characterized by assessing its binding profile to a range of influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) strains. Monoclonal antibodies were identified that bound to individual and composite peptides and live viruses, while also showing cross neutralizing potential against influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) in the microneutralization assay. mAb GA4, along with other monoclonal antibodies that bind HA and NA protein, are being evaluated for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity.",

Randomized phase 2 study evaluating nitazoxanide versus placebo in hospitalized subjects with severe acute respiratory illness John Beigel, NIAID, Bethesda, MD, USA. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is a small inhibitor used extensively for treatment of Giardia and Cryptosporidium infections, and is being explored for the treatment of influenza and other influenza-like illnesses (ILI) (Rossignol, 2014; Shakya et al., 2018) such as parainfluenza (PIV), RSV, canine coronavirus, rhinovirus and influenza (Haffizulla et al., 2014; Piacentini et al., 2018; Rossignol, 2014; Stachulski et al., 2017) . Moreover, NTZ is shown to be synergistic with oseltamivir and zanamivir (Belardo et al., 2011) . From March 2014 through March 2017, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in participants \u22651 year of age hospitalized with influenza-like illness (ILI) at six hospitals in Mexico. 260 participants were randomized 1:1 to NTZ (\u226512 years old, 600 mg twice daily; 4-11 and 1-3 years old, 200 or 100 mg twice daily, respectively) or placebo for 5 days in addition to SOC (Gamino-Arroyo et al., 2019). The primary endpoint was time to hospital discharge. Of the 260 participants enrolled, 257 were randomized and took at least one dose of study treatment. The median duration of hospitalization in the NTZ group was 6.5 (4.0, 9.0) days versus 7.0 days (4.0, 9.0) in the placebo group (p = 0.56). The duration of hospitalization between the two treatment groups was similar in both children (p = 0.29) and adults (p = 0.62), influenza A and B (p = 0.32), and other respiratory viruses. 83 (63.8%) participants receiving NTZ reported 205 adverse events compared to 80 (63.0%) participants receiving placebo with 185 adverse events. In conclusion, treatment with NTZ was safe but did not reduce duration of hospital stay in severe influenza-like illness.",

Despite the significant clinical impact of influenza each year, current therapeutic options for influenza have only been FDA approved for acute uncomplicated cases and there remains a paucity of data regarding safe and effective treatments for serious influenza infection in hospitalized patients. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of novel therapeutics in combination with SOC therapy versus SOC alone for hospitalized influenza have failed to demonstrate a significant superiority when compared to SOC (de Jong et al., 2014; Marty et al., 2017) . These RCTs have been limited by enrollment of a highly heterogenous hospitalized population, and experienced difficulty in patient enrollment. Use of a standardized assessment to consistently measure the severity-of-illness may help to identify a more homogenous trial population that is seriously ill due to influenza infection. One example of a clinical severity-of-illness scale is the National Early Warning Score (NEWS/NEWS2) (Royal College of Physicians, 2018); however, it still requires prospective evaluation of its use in this population. In addition to the use of a severity-of-illness scale, other eligibility criteria such as use of supplemental oxygen, respiratory support, or other influenzarelated conditions may also be useful to target an appropriate trial population for enrollment for which clinical benefit from a therapeutic may be demonstrated.",

The focus is on the assessment of safety and efficacy in populations most likely to develop RSV LRTI and severe RSV disease, including infants and toddlers (aged 28 days to 23 months) and older adults (e.g. aged \u226560 years). For candidate DAAs, double-blind superiority trials (candidate DAA versus uncontrolled group) based on clinically relevant primary endpoints are currently feasible (this may need reconsideration in the future) It is also essential that there are clear definitions of RSV cases based on a combination of clinical and laboratory criteria.",

New drugs for treatment and prevention should demonstrate broad antiviral activity against diverse RSV strains and sponsors should monitor for the emergence of amino acid substitutions that may confer resistance. Randomized, double-blind, comparative trials should be conducted for both treatment and prevention products. Optimal endpoints have not been established for treatment trials. Phase 2 studies should evaluate a combination of clinical and virologic endpoints, while phase 3 trial endpoints should reflect improvement in clinical signs and symptoms of RSV-associated illness (\"feel, function, and survive\"). For prevention trials, FDA's preferred endpoint is laboratoryconfirmed, medically attended LRTI. In order to facilitate development of novel drugs, collaborative efforts are needed to develop definitions of disease severity, establish consensus definitions of LRTI, and develop reliable instruments to measure clinical improvement.",

In 2005, RSV disease severity was first correlated with viral load . Furthermore, a significant correlation between initial viral load in the upper and lower airways in intubated children was found (Perkins et al., 2005) . Faster RSV clearance is independently associated with shorter hospitalization (El Saleeby et al., 2011) . A low passage, live, clinical cGMP grade RSV virus known as Memphis 37 (RSV M37) was generated for use in human challenge studies (Kim et al., 2014) . Challenge models in healthy adults demonstrated the parallel nature of viral kinetics and disease kinetics within this human model system (DeVincenzo et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "Aerosolized ribavirin was first marketed in 1980 for the treatment of RSV in children, but to date there is still no convincing evidence as to its clinical benefit or antiviral effect in human populations. In special populations including the immunocompromised (Beaird et al., 2016) , it is often delivered in the oral or IV form which generates drug concentrations at sites of RSV replication far lower than needed to inhibit viral replication . Several potent and selective small molecule antiviral compounds have been identified and have progressed to clinical trials. MDT-637 is a novel RSV fusion inhibitor that may produce a superior clinical effect compared to ribavirin on natural RSV infections . GS-5806 is another fusion inhibitor that has been shown to decrease viral load and severity of clinical disease . ALS-008176 (lumicitabine) is an oral nucleoside analog that demonstrated proof of concept in a human RSV challenge model (DeVincenzo et al., 2015) . Finally, PC786 is a nonnucleoside L protein polymerase inhibitor that has undergone preclinical characterization (Coates et al., 2017) . Other antivirals are also in clinical development including those representing the fusion inhibitor class and replication inhibitor class. Further understanding of RSV replication kinetics in the individual at-risk populations, as well as virus dynamics in their upper and lower respiratory tract disease, are needed to adroitly design clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of these and other antivirals in clinical settings. MERS is caused by a novel human coronavirus, MERS-CoV, which is thought to be transmitted to humans via close contact with camels. In the six years since the identification of MERS-CoV there have been over 2,000 documented cases of MERS in humans with \u223c35% mortality rate reported from 27 countries. More than 85% of MERS-CoV cases occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The spectrum of the disease varies from asymptomatic (identified during contact tracing) to severe illness characterized by hypoxemic respiratory failure and eventual multi-organ failure resulting in a mortality in critically ill patients that reaches \u223c67% (Arabi et al., 2017b) . One post mortem analysis has revealed that MERS-CoV infected patient lungs had detectable necrotizing pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage. In addition, there was acute kidney and liver damage and myositis. The virus was identified in this case by electron microscopy in the lung, kidney and muscle. Higher levels of interferon and MERS-CoV specific antibodies have been linked with a better outcome when compared to patients with lower levels.",

            "text": "Treatment of patients with MERS has proven challenging, with no specific antiviral therapy of proven efficacy available to date. In one multicenter cohort study that adjusted for time-varying confounders, corticosteroid treatment in MERS-CoV infected patients was not significantly associated with a difference in mortality rates but was associated with delay in MERS-CoV RNA clearance (Arabi et al., 2018b) . Treatment with convalescent plasma, while promising is likely not feasible, given the limited pool of potential donors. One study showed that even recovering patients from MERS do not have sufficient antibody titers for therapeutic use (Arabi et al., 2015 (Arabi et al., , 2016 . Ribavirin and interferon \u03b12b treatment produced promising preclinical data in rhesus macaques, including moderate reductions in viral load and partially effective prevention of progression to pneumonia when infected animals were compared with untreated infected controls (Falzarano et al., 2013) . However, data on MERS-CoV infected patients treated with a combination of ribavirin and interferon (either \u03b12a or \u03b21) have been inconsistent depending on the statistical analysis methods used to compare the datasets (Al Ghamdi et al., 2016; Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014; Omrani et al., 2014; Shalhoub et al., 2018) . The largest study that adjusted for time-varying confounders that might influence the decision to initiate ribavirin and interferon therapy did not show an improvement in mortality (Arabi et al., 2017a) . Furthermore, the dose of ribavirin required to reduce MERS-CoV replication are often associated with significant toxicities in humans (Hart et al., 2014) . Of all interferons tested, interferon \u03b2 was the most effective against MERS-CoV in vitro at doses that were lower than clinical treatment regimens Hart et al., 2014) . The human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon \u03b1 treatment have been shown to be effective in SARS-CoV infected patients and also reduced weight loss, clinical scores, viral titers and disease progression in MERS-CoV infected marmosets (Chan et al., 2015; Chu et al., 2004; de Wilde et al., 2013) . Lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon \u03b2 treatment is now being evaluated in the MIRACLE trial for MERS-CoV infected patients (NCT02845843) and has currently recruited 35 patients from 10 sites (Arabi et al., 2018a) .",

There were no SAEs reported, and only 13 AEs reported from 8 patients (no AEs were thought to be dose related). There was a dose dependent decrease in symptom score at 24 h after a single dose of ziresovir. No patient who received ziresovir deteriorated, in contrast to the placebo group. Early results suggest ziresovir has clinical efficacy against RSV. This would be the first antiviral that has shown clinical benefit in infants and in naturally acquired RSV disease.

Phenotypic NAI assays are wellcharacterized but require a cultivated isolate, which make them inadequate as a point-of-care diagnostic, and they are generally less sensitive for detecting resistant variants in mixed populations (Wetherall et al., 2003) ; however, newer technologies have attempted to reduce turn-around time and increase the sensitivity of the standard NAI assay (Gubareva et al., 2017) . Lack of standardization and a clear relationship between the level of reduced susceptibility and clinical outcomes make phenotypic assays difficult to interpret, but this also is a continuing area of study. Genotypic assays are generally rapid and sensitive, but require prior knowledge of the effect of certain mutations on virus susceptibility. Genotypic assays can vary in scope, from realtime PCR SNP detection to Sanger or 'next-generation' sequencing of whole genes or genomes. The advent of influenza antivirals with distinct mechanisms of action will require new assays and approaches. Phenotypic assays for baloxavir are currently neither rapid nor highthroughput, although advances are currently being made, and the genetic determinants of reduced susceptibility to baloxavir are still being defined. As with all classes of drugs, surveillance will involve the use of genotypic and phenotypic assays to account for the emergence and spread of resistance.",

To better understand this relationship in a model system, the impact of oseltamivir treatment was evaluated in ferrets infected with influenza type A and B viruses with and without resistance-associated NA substitutions and representing a range of susceptibilities (IC 50 values) to oseltamivir in an NA inhibition assay.

Treatment was continued twice daily for 10 days. Antiviral activity of oseltamivir was assessed based on the virus shedding area under the curve (AUC) reduction (%) relative to placebo. Oseltamivir treatment was least effective against type B virus infection, which exhibited an IC 50 10-fold greater than type A viruses. Among type A viruses, which varied by approximately 3-to 5-fold in IC 50 values, there was no clear association between virus shedding reduction and IC 50 values. There was no demonstrable antiviral effect of oseltamivir compared to placebo in ferrets infected with viruses with NA resistance substitutions, which had IC 50 values ranging from 65.6 to 414.8 nM. Based on a linear regression model of the relationship between infecting virus IC 50 value and virus shedding AUC in ferrets, IC 50 values > 14.7 nM and > 68.4 nM were associated with > 50% and > 90% reductions in oseltamivir effectiveness, respectively. Large differences in susceptibilities of viruses in a NAI assays may be predictive of impacts of oseltamivir treatment on virus shedding, but how such differences relate to clinical outcomes in humans, and whether smaller differences in susceptibility may be predictive of treatment response, requires additional investigation. PA endonuclease inhibitors are a new class of antivirals against influenza virus, which act by inhibiting the ability of the virus to prime viral gene transcription using m 7 G cap-containing oligomers cleaved from host mRNAs by the endonuclease activity of PA, a member of the influenza virus polymerase complex (Dias et al., 2009) . Baloxavir marboxil is the first PA inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of influenza virus infection. First-generation PA inhibitors include diketo acid structures that act by chelating the bivalent cations within the PA active site, but these inhibitors have low affinity (micromolar range) and low selectivity indices (Ju et al., 2017; Stevaert et al., 2013) . Baloxavir acid (the active form of baloxavir marboxil ); and the structurally similar RO-7 (Jones et al., 2016) , improve on the original concept by maintaining a diketo acid-like motif in a fused ring structure and have increased selectivity and affinity (nanomolar range) for the PA endonuclease active site (Jones et al., 2016; Noshi et al., 2018) .",

The resistant phenotype was maintained after an additional 5 passages in the absence of RO-7 selective pressure, indicating the fitness cost of reduced susceptibility to RO-7 may be limited. Sequencing of PA revealed a single amino acid substitution: I38T, which has also been selected by baloxavir acid in cell culture (Byrn et al., 2015) , and is to date the most frequently observed treatment-emergent resistance substitution in baloxavir marboxil-treated patients . Cocrystallization of RO-7 and the PA N-terminal region, which contains the endonuclease domain, revealed that the I38T disrupts a strong hydrophobic interaction between RO-7 and the binding pocket. Isothermal calorimetry of the PA protein in the presence of RO-7 revealed a nearly 500-fold reduction in the K D of RO-7 binding to PA (9.5 nM-4600 nM) associated with the I38T substitution.",

While circulating virus with substitutions that are known to reduce susceptibility to baloxavir are currently rare, rapid and robust assays are needed for active surveillance for virus with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir. The plaque assay is well characterized and robust, but depends on visualization of the cytopathic effect of virus spreading among neighboring cells and requires several days of incubation for plaques to form that are large enough to visualize. In addition, some viruses are not highly cytopathic. In focus-forming assays, spread of virus from a single infected cell to neighboring cells is detected by immunofluorescent staining and automated microscopic imaging.

There were no clear outliers indicative of significantly reduced susceptibility, and all viruses expressed wild-type PA I38; however, the limited variation in EC 50 values observed could be driven by other viral genetic determinants. Baloxavir exhibited wild-type EC 50 values against reference strains with known NAI resistance substitutions, consistent with the distinct mechanism of action of baloxavir. Nationwide surveillance for viruses with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir in Japan will be implemented using this high-throughput focus forming assay.",

Most cell culture-based assays are slow and cumbersome, requiring multiple rounds of virus replication. To facilitate surveillance efforts, the CDC laboratory has developed a single-cycle assay: high-content imaging-based neutralization test (HINT). In this assay, MDCK-SIAT1 cells are infected with influenza virus in the absence of trypsin to limit virus spread. After 16-24 h of incubation, cells are fixed, immuno-fluorescently stained with anti-NP antibody, and imaged using an automated fluorescent cell counter. Baloxavir EC 50 values measured using the HINT assay were within approximately 2-fold of values obtained by focus reduction and plaque reduction assays . The HINT assay revealed that the PA-I38L substitution, detected in two A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, but as yet un-characterized, conferred a 7-fold reduction in baloxavir susceptibility, which is comparable to the 10fold reduction observed for the previously characterized treatmentemergent I38M substitution . For pimodivir, the HINT EC 50 values were 8-fold higher than EC 50 values determined by focus reduction assay; nevertheless, the fold changes conferred by PB2-S324C and S324R substitutions remained consistent between two assays. The HINT assay provides a higher throughput option for phenotypic surveillance of seasonal and other low pathogenic influenza viruses; HINT does not work with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. As the HINT assay is not yet available for influenza C and D viruses, their susceptibility to baloxavir was assessed using the virus yield reduction assay. Baloxavir potently inhibited replication of all viruses tested and showed the highest activity against type A and the lowest (\u223c8-fold) against influenza D viruses.",

Substitutions that reduce susceptibility to baloxavir have been shown to reduce replicative capacity in cell culture , but certain genetic backgrounds or compensatory substitutions may increase replicative fitness in vivo and transmissibility of resistant viruses. Such determinants have not been yet been identified, although the rate of treatment-emergent substitutions is far higher in type A influenza virus compared to type B influenza virus. It is not clear if this difference in rates between influenza virus types is driven primarily by reduced activity of baloxavir against type B virus or a greater fitness cost of resistance in type B virus.",

Additional work is ongoing to describe the impact all the substitutions observed in reported sequences at these and other sites (Gubareva et al., 2019) .

These observations raise the possibility that baloxavir marboxil may be more effective if used in combination with another antiviral (i.e. NAIs), which may not only enhance overall effectiveness, but also mitigate the risk selecting for transmissible resistant viruses that could end up in wide circulation, as was the fate of adamantanes.",

The SARS-CoV/bat-CoV spike viruses were evaluated in cell lines expressing either the human, bat, or civet angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, cellular receptor) to determine host species specificity, and to identify candidate bat-CoV strains to generate infectious clones based on the entire bat coronavirus genome. Four of the six SARS-CoV/bat-CoV spike viruses tested could use all three ACE2 molecules for entry and replicated to high titers (> 10 6 plaque forming units/mL) (Becker et al., 2008; Menachery et al., 2015; Rockx et al., 2007) . These four bat coronavirus strains were then isolated from infectious clones derived from their respective genomes and the resulting virus progeny used to characterize replication kinetics in immortalized cell lines and primary human lung cell cultures and to perform in vivo vaccination or treatment experiments in comparison to wild type SARS-CoV. SHC014 and WIV1 replicated to high titers, the same titers as wild type SARS-CoV, in primary lung cell cultures suggesting that these strains were fully competent to infect humans. In murine disease models of highly pathogenic human coronavirus infection the bat coronavirus strains were attenuated in comparison to wild type mouse adapted SARS-CoV. Vaccination studies demonstrated that vaccines specific for SARS-CoV were not effective against the bat coronavirus strains and antibody treatments that were protective for SARS-CoV failed against the bat strains (Becker et al., 2008; Menachery et al., 2015; Rockx et al., 2007 Rockx et al., , 2008 . These data highlight how crucial it is to evaluate all treatment options on more than just the current and past human strain(s) and SARS-and MERS-CoV so that appropriate treatment and vaccination strategies are stock piled to be prepared for future epidemics.",

Remdesivir pharmacokinetic studies have been completed and this compound is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for Ebola virus efficacy (NCT03719586). Nucleotide/side analogues including remdesivir were tested to determine if they were effective against highly pathogenic human coronaviruses despite previous studies demonstrating that nucleotide analogues generally have poor activity against coronaviruses due to the proofreading enzyme that is part of the viral replication machinery. Studies in human lung cell lines and primary human lung epithelial cell cultures demonstrated that remdesivir is effective against both SARS-and MERS-CoV as well as the pre-epidemic bat-CoV strains described earlier (Sheahan et al., 2017) . In parallel, in vitro passage studies were also performed to determine if coronavirus genomes could evolve to replicate in the presence of remdesivir. After 23 passages in the presence of drug, two mutations were identified in the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene (F276L and V553L) that allowed for increased replication in the presence of remdesivir (Agostini et al., 2018) . These two amino acid changes decrease viral fitness overall and attenuate SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model of SARS-CoV induced disease (Agostini et al., 2018) . In both prophylactic and therapeutic (24 h post infection) dosing regimens of SARS-CoV infected animals, remdesivir treated animals had a > 2 log reduction in viral titers by Day 4 or 5 post infection (Sheahan et al., 2017) . Remdesivir treated animals also maintained their starting weight throughout the infection time course while vehicle treated animals lost 20% of their starting weight by Day 4 or 5 post infection (Sheahan et al., 2017) . Finally, improved lung function (less airway constriction and reduced times between breaths) was seen when treated animals were compared to SARS-CoV infected untreated control animals (Sheahan et al., 2017) . Similar results were seen with MERS-CoV in prophylactic dosing studies performed in the Baric laboratory's MERS-CoV mouse model (Cockrell et al., 2016) . In contrast, therapeutic treatment with human monoclonal antibodies did not protect against MERS-CoV induced severe disease or protect from loss of lung function in animal models of highly pathogenic human coronavirus disease (Cockrell et al., 2016) . Remdesivir is a promising broad-spectrum antiviral that may prove useful in the treatment of highly pathogenic human coronavirus.",

Remdesivir provides superior therapeutic efficacy to lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta against MERS-CoV Amy Sims, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. Currently there are no US FDA approved therapeutics to treat SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection. A wide range of compounds have been evaluated for activity against highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, including biologics and small molecules. Among them, nucleotide analog remdesivir showed potent activity against coronaviruses (reviewed above in the Baric and Arabi summaries). Remdesivir is currently being evaluated in a randomized clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Ebola virus disease (NCT03719586). The combination of lopinavir and ritonavir is an FDA approved antiviral for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections (Croxtall and Perry, 2010; Perry et al., 2016) . Previous studies on the antiviral activity of lopinavir against MERS-CoV are conflicting with one study reporting micromolar EC 50 values in a human hepatoma cell line (Huh 7) yet another reported that lopinavir had no activity in a non-human primate kidney cell line (Vero) de Wilde et al., 2014) . Type I interferons are approved for treating multiple indications including hepatitis B and C, and multiple sclerosis (Dumitrescu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018) . Two studies showed interferon-beta was effective against MERS-CoV infection in non-human primate kidney cells (Vero) with EC 50 values < 10 IU/mL Hart et al., 2014) . Clinical observations and in vivo animal models indicate outcomes of MERS-CoV infection are mediated by both virus replication and the resultant host inflammatory response, so combination therapies directly targeting both the virus and host may represent the best course of treatment for highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. As such, the cocktail of lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon-beta is currently being evaluated in patients infected with MERS-CoV in the MIRACLE trial (Arabi et al., 2018a) .",

Infected and mock-infected human lung epithelial cells (Calu 3) were treated with dilution series of lopinavir (50 \u03bcM-0.05 \u03bcM), ritonavir (50 \u03bcM-0.05 \u03bcM), interferon-beta (2800 IU/mL to 5.5 IU/mL), or remdesivir (10 \u03bcM-0.02 \u03bcM) and results were assayed 48 h post infection. Cytotoxicity was evaluated in non-infected cells and EC 50 values were determined for each drug. Both lopinavir and ritonavir demonstrated moderate to minimal inhibition of virus replication with respective EC 50 values of 10 and 34 \u03bcM. Interferon-beta treatment of MERS-CoV infected human lung epithelial cells inhibited viral replication similar to previous studies in non-human primate kidney cells (Vero) Hart et al., 2014) ; however, the EC 50 value in our studies was higher (175 IU/mL in human lung cells and < 10 IU/mL in non-human primate kidney cells). In contrast, remdesivir potently inhibited MERS-CoV replication with sub-micromolar EC 50 (0.11 \u03bcM) (Sheahan et al., 2017) . To facilitate in vivo efficacy studies with MERS-CoV in rodents, a mouse model was generated through the humanization of the murine ortholog of the human receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (Cockrell et al., 2016) in conjunction with the genetic deletion of carboxyl esterase 1 (Ces1c \u2212/\u2212 ) to minimize rodent serum esterase-specific remdesivir degradation (Sheahan et al., 2017) . The dosage for the combination of lopinavir (160 mg/kg, QD) and ritonavir (40 mg/kg, QD) were based on human equivalent dose using body surface area. Mouse recombinant interferon-beta was dosed at two concentrations (1.6 \u00d7 10 6 and 4 \u00d7 10 7 IU/ kg, QD) to cover 1x and 25x human equivalent doses, respectively. Dosage of remdesivir (25 mg/kg BID) was chosen based on pharmacokinetic studies performed in Ces1c \u2212/\u2212 mice (Sheahan et al., 2017) . When treatment was initiated one day post infection (dpi) with mouse adapted MERS-CoV, lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon-beta treatment did not reduce levels of virus replication as compared to their vehicle controls 6 dpi, while remdesivir treatment reduced viral titers by 3 logs relative its vehicle controls. These findings support the potential clinical development of remdesivir as a MERS-CoV antiviral.",

Further, in vivo replicative fitness of the PA-I38M virus was evaluated using a ferret model. The ferrets shed both A(H3N2) viruses, wild type and PA-I38M, for 7 consecutive days. Nasal wash titers were \u223c0.5 log 10 lower on 4 dpi in the PA-I38M-infected animals. No reversion from methionine to isoleucine at residue 38 in the PA protein was detected at any time point by pyrosequencing analysis. To get additional insights into replicative capacity of the wild type vs PA-I38M virus, a competitive growth experiment was carried out, where ferrets were co-inoculated with both viruses at ratios of 70:30, 30:70 or 10:90 at a total of 10\u02c63 PFU. Pyrosequencing analysis of virus populations in nasal washes collected over a 7-day period revealed an incremental reduction in the proportion of the PA-I38M virus population.

Examining clinical data on potential adjunctive therapies in influenza Nelson Lee, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. The meeting was closed with a review of prior works on adjunctive therapies in influenza. As previously noted, the high mortality rates in emerging diseases such as novel coronavirus infectious (MERS and SARS) and novel avian influenza strains (influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9)) have raised questions about the possible role of pro-inflammatory responses in the pathogenesis. Prior studies demonstrated cytokine hyperactivation associated with uncontrolled viral replication; and a sustained inflammatory state correlates with disease progression leading to respiratory failure and ARDS. Therapeutics targeting the pathogen alone have thus far largely unsuccessful in reversing such processes.",

The triple combination of oseltamivir, clarithromycin, and naproxen was demonstrated to reduce adverse outcomes in another study (Hung et al., 2017) , but these findings, though intriguing, should be confirmed. Sirolimus has been used with apparent benefit in critically ill influenza patients in the context of an RCT (Wang et al., 2014) , confirmatory studies of this approach without concomitant corticosteroid therapy can be explored. The efficacy of other agents with potential immunomodulating effects, including N-acetylcysteine (NAC), statins, nitazoxanide (NTZ), IFNs, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) agonists, cyclooxygenase (COX 2) inhibitors, recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), diltiazem, and herbal medicine, all have some supporting preclinical or clinical data, but these need to be studied more intensely, preferably by RCTs .",
