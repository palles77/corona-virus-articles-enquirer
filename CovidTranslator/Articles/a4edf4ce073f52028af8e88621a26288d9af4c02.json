Epidemiological investigation of these cases has proved challenging. The European Food Safety Authority recently recommended the collection of a predefined set of epidemiological data from BSE suspects and confirmed BSE cases to aid future investigations. In this study, we present an epidemiological framework and BSE investigation questionnaire to aid the investigation of suspect BSE cases, and illustrate its application during the investigation of a BSE case in Ireland in 2015. It is recommended that the framework and questionnaire are used concurrently: the framework provides structure and focus, whereas the questionnaire (with 135 questions) aids data collection. The framework focuses on confirmation and discrimination, estimating the date and location of exposure, and determining the method/ source of exposure. The BSE case in Ireland in 2015 was a BARB case born in 2010. It was identified with classical BSE at an authorised knackery as part of Ireland's targeted active surveillance programme for BSE. No definitive source of infection with the BSE agent could be attributed in this case.",

The International Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) assigns a BSE disease status to member countries, and in 2016 categorised 46 countries as having a negligible BSE risk and 8 as having a controlled BSE risk. 6 In Ireland, the first case of BSE was diagnosed in 1989. 7 By December 31, 2016 , 1660 cases of BSE had been confirmed in Ireland, including four atypical BSE cases, as discussed later. Most clinical BSE cases have been detected in cattle aged between four and eight years, with an age range from three to twelve years. 8 9 Since 1989, it has been a legal requirement for any person observing an animal with clinical signs consistent with BSE to inform the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM). In line with EU legislation, all cohorts and progeny of BSE-positive animals are traced, killed and disposed of outside the food chain.",

Legislation banning the use of proteins derived from mammalian tissues for feeding ruminant animals was introduced at the EU level in June 1994. In 1996, enhanced controls on the production, sale or supply of mammalian meat and bone meal (MBM), as defined by the OIE, 10 were introduced in Ireland 11 and in the UK. 12 At the EU level, legislation was introduced in January 2001 to enforce a total ban on the feeding of processed animal proteins to farmed animals. A total feed ban was implemented on May 1, 2004 in the 10 central and eastern European countries that joined the EU on that date (the 'newer' EU member states). Therefore, a total feed ban has been in place in Ireland since 2001, or since 2004 in all member states, but reinforced feed bans had previously been implemented in Ireland and the UK in 1996. Given this context, it has been challenging to determine the aetiology for those BSE cases born after the reinforced bans (BARB), and in particular the five classical BSE cases born between 2006 and 2011 (3 UK, 1 France, 1 Ireland).",

            "text": "The aetiology of BSE remains contentious. Early evidence suggested that BSE was caused by a single major strain, commonly referred to as classical BSE. 13 More recently, two sporadic atypical forms of BSE have been identified (namely high-type (H-BSE) and low-type (L-BSE)), which differ from classical BSE. 14 15 The unusually old age of all H-BSE and L-BSE cases, and their apparent low prevalence in the population, could suggest that these atypical BSE forms are arising spontaneously. 16 However, there is no comprehensive information available on the aetiology and pathogenesis of atypical BSE in cattle. Serial passage of H-BSE in other species can lead to the emergence of a classical BSE phenotype, raising the possibility that classical BSE emerged from H-BSE. [17] [18] [19] Such passage can also lead to the emergence of new strains of BSE, 20 which underlines the lack of aetiological clarity for BSE and the challenges in determining controls suitable to deal with it. For BARB cases, it is suggested that the majority of cases have arisen due to continued exposure to contaminated feed. 21 This view is also supported by a more recent UK study that hypothesises that the continued occurrence of classical BSE is due to an exogenous feedborne source, as a result of an over-reliance on imported feedstuffs into Great Britain and the later introduction of a ban on the use of mammalian MBM in other EU member states in January 2001. 12 Milk replacer, containing extracted animal fats, has been implicated as a source of BSE for cattle in a number of countries. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Other routes of transmission, such as maternal, environmental and iatrogenic, have also been proposed. In a review of the epidemiological features of cases of BSE born after in Great Britain, Wilesmith and others 12 concluded that there was no evidence of a maternally associated risk factor. However, these authors also state that the nature of the risk of maternal transmission remains uncertain. In the same paper, the authors considered two means of environmental contamination to be possible: first, that in the early years of the epidemic in the UK, a proportion of clinically infected animals were buried; and secondly, the potential excretion of the BSE agent in faeces. Nonetheless, the authors concluded that there was no evidence that a substantial number of BARB cases in the UK occurred as a result of environmental contamination (other than from feedstuffs). Also, of significance regarding environmental contamination is spatial information regarding the location of the index farm in relation to previously infected premises or other local features of potential interest, for example, knackeries. Iatrogenic transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) has been demonstrated in human beings. This was linked to human growth hormone therapy, 27 donated tissues, 28 surgical instruments 29 and blood. 30 Iatrogenic transmission of scrapie through vaccines prepared from ovine material has also been documented. 31 32 Posterior pituitary extract was used in veterinary practices at the start of the BSE epidemic in the UK, but no association between its use and the occurrence of BSE was found. 2 A spontaneous origin has been proposed for a number of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), including atypical BSE as mentioned above, atypical scrapie 33 34 and sporadic CJD. 35 Because of the long interval between the implementation of the total feed bans and the time of occurrence of BSE cases in some EU member states such as Ireland, UK and France, consideration must also be given to the possibility that some cases of classical BSE occur due to spontaneous mutation of prions. As yet, however, this hypothesis is speculative and there is currently no supporting scientific evidence.",

Such studies seek to address a range of objectives, including an improved understanding of disease epidemiology 11 36 and the spatiotemporal distribution of cases. 37 38 There has been limited information on fieldbased epidemiological methods to investigate suspect cases of BSE, in contrast to other diseases such as foot and mouth disease where applied (field-based) epidemiological methods are available. 39 This last concern has been further highlighted in a recent scientific opinion from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which recommended the creation of a predefined set of epidemiological data to be collected across the EU for the investigation of future BSE cattle suspects and new confirmed BSE cases. 40 This approach would also be of potential value to countries with no previous BSE experience, when faced with a first or single case of BSE.",

At each step of the framework, we describe the tools available, information required and the relevant questions from the supplementary questionnaire. The steps to be taken during the investigation are guided by the type of BSE (classical or atypical) identified, as determined by OIE-approved discriminatory testing. If atypical H-type or L-type BSE is confirmed, the investigation does not progress beyond '1. Confirmation and discrimination'. If classical BSE is confirmed, the investigation continues to include '2. Estimating the date and location of exposure' and '3. Determining the method/source of exposure'. Decisions with respect to '3. Determining the method/source of exposure' should be made using a legal standard of proof of at least 'on the balance of probabilities' or 'on the preponderance of the evidence', 41 42 after considering all data relevant to the biological plausibility of each alternative.

The field investigation began once a positive screening test result was received, noting the high specificity of these tests. 43 The likely infection window (encompassing the most likely period of infection of the case animal) was determined to be 2010, the year of birth. The case animal was born and died in the index herd. The identification of the cohort group, in line with DAFM protocols, took account of animals born in the index herd during 2010, and also those born in the previous (2009) and subsequent (2011) years. Data with respect to animal feed were gathered, including receipts and records in relation to animal feed and feeding systems. All feed business operators (FeBOs) that supplied proprietary feed to the index farm were contacted by DAFM to obtain details of all animal feed supplied to this farm during October to December (Q4) 2009 and throughout 2010. In addition, all questions in the BSE investigation questionnaire were completed, providing a summary of each line of investigation outlined in the epidemiological framework. Estimating the date and location of exposure Examination of DAFM's national bovine registration and movement data showed that the case animal was born in the index herd and had remained there throughout its life.

As well as carrying out a thorough investigation of the feed supply chain for the index herd, the investigation team evaluated the potential for contaminated feed to have been supplied to the farm. In 2009 and 2010, few BSE cases were detected in Ireland (9 in 2009, 2 in 2010) compared with a high of 333 in 2002. Also, comprehensive control measures had been put in place in 2009 and 2010, including active and passive surveillance, removal and destruction of dead-on-farm animals, effective rendering systems, and controls with regard to the potential for cross-contamination at mills. Feed imported into Ireland was also subject to routine inspection and testing, which did not identify any bone spicules. These controls led to a substantial reduction in the likelihood of contaminated feed acting as a source of the BSE agent. However, because of the passage of time, it was not possible to be certain that we obtained complete information on all possible sources of contamination of feed for the index herd. It has been shown that an animal can be infected by a very low oral dose of the BSE prion, with the attack rate and incubation period dependent on the dose. 46 47 Findings in the UK have highlighted the possibility of persistence of traces of contaminated feed in on-farm feed stores and the need for special care in the cleaning and maintenance of feed bins and silos and other feed storage facilities. 36 Consequently, inadvertent exposure to the BSE agent in residues of old particles of feed cannot be definitively ruled out.",

We had no reason to doubt the reliability of information obtained from farm records, from the herd owner and from the PVP.",

The epidemiological framework and BSE investigation questionnaire overcome some of these challenges, in particular the use of methodology to facilitate data collection that is comprehensive and consistent. Further, the framework and questionnaire are underpinned by best available science. Nonetheless, several challenges remain that contribute to the difficulty in attributing cause to recent BSE cases. By its nature, a case study does not allow definite conclusions to be drawn on the source of disease. Further, the role of any specific putative source cannot be directly tested as no information is available on suitable controls. Finally, because of the passage of time between exposure and the development of clinical signs, there are inevitable information gaps that hamper attribution of the source of the BSE agent. Ireland's 2015 BSE case was identified through existing surveillance mechanisms, and the investigation provided evidence that all BSE controls are operating as intended. Based on the investigation, no definitive source of infection with the BSE agent was identified.",

We note that the main objective of the epidemiological framework is to hypothesise, or rule out, possible BSE sources on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt. The framework provides an epidemiological logic to the assembly of evidence and allows the different steps of the investigation to be fully documented. The framework and associated questionnaire uses the best information available at the time of investigation of BSE cases. Given the rarity of BARB cases and uncertainty surrounding the source of infection for these cases, particularly as the interval between the implementation of the reinforced feed ban and the occurrence of new cases increases, it is essential that a comprehensive and thorough investigation of each new BARB case is carried out. It is hoped that the investigation procedure described here will be of benefit in that regard and that the information provided by the investigations will assist veterinary authorities in ensuring that the measures in place to eradicate BSE continue to be relevant, appropriate and fit for purpose.",
