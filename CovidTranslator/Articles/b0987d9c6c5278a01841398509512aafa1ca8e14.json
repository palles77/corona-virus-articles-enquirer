            "text": "To assess the rapidly changing psychological status of nurses during the acute phase of the 2003 SARS outbreak, we conducted a prospective and periodic evaluation of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation among nurses in SARS units and non-SARS units. Nurse participants were from two SARS units (regular SARS [N = 44] and SARS ICU [N = 26]) and two non-SARS units (Neurology [N = 15] and CCU [N = 17]). Participants periodically self-evaluated their depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, sleep disturbance, attitude towards SARS and family support. Results showed that depression (38.5% vs. 3.1%) and insomnia (37% vs. 9.7%) were, respectively, greater in the SARS unit nurses than the non-SARS unit nurses. No difference between these two groups was found in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (33% vs. 18.7%), yet, three unit subjects (SARS ICU, SARS regular and Neurology) had significantly higher rate than those in CCU (29.7% vs. 11.8%, respectively) (p < 0.05). For the SARS unit nurses, significant reduction in mood ratings, insomnia rate and perceived negative feelings as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of SARS at the end of the study (all p < 0.001) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred. The adjustment of nurses in the more structured SARS ICU environment, where nurses care for even more severely ill patients, may have been as good or better than that of nurses in the regular SARS unit. Occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was linked to direct exposure to SARS patient care, previous mood disorder history, younger age and perceived negative feelings. Positive coping attitude and strong social and family support may have protected against acute stress. In conclusion, the psychological impact on the caring staffs facing future bio-disaster will be minimized with lowered risk factors and a safer and more structured work environment.",

            "text": "In the early 21st century, an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a pneumonia-like viral disease, sickened nearly 8000 people worldwide, killing 744 in 2003, according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2003) . Taiwan was not spared from this global catastrophe. The first case was reported in mid-March and by the end of July 2003, there were 1320 suspected cases and 668 probable cases, and the overall fatality rate was 10.8% (Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Taiwan, 2003) . The peak SARS period took place between April 20 and May 27, 2003. Two peak outbreaks occurred during the peak season and both were due to nosocomial transmission. In late April, the SARS infection rate for medical personnel reached 33%, and several of them died of SARS. The percentage of infected health care workers (HCWs) ranged from 3% in the United States (Update SARS-USA, 2003) to as high as 22% in Hong-Kong (Hong Kong Government, 2003) and 51% in Toronto (Booth et al., 2003) . The psychological impact of SARS on HCWs was a serious concern at the time of the outbreak and thereafter. The published reports ranged from descriptive and retrospective Maunder, 2004) to systematic evaluations of the psychiatric morbidity and post-traumatic symptoms of HCWs in SARS care environments Sim et al., 2004; Chua et al., 2004; Chan and Huak, 2004; Chen et al., 2005; Chong et al., 2004) . Most studies were designed in a cross-sectional manner to assess the stress level (using the impact of event scale, IES) (Horowitz et al., 1979) and psychiatric symptoms (using the general health questionnaire, GHQ-28) (Goldberg, 1978) . These studies only estimated the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity and interaction of morbidity with perceived stress and did not longitudinally follow up changes in psychological state in response to caring for SARS patients. There is one prospective study (Cheng et al., 2004) examining the short-term adjustment outcomes among Chinese patients after 1-month recovery from SARS and investigating the risk factors on outcome measures. Our aims were to prospectively and periodically investigate and compare the psychiatric morbidity and to test the hypothesis that the morbidity rate was higher in SARS unit subjects than in those in non-SARS units. In addition, we hypothesized that the severity of mood and sleep symptoms is also greater in SARS ICU subjects than in those in SARS regular unit. We also expected that the psychological distress of the study subjects in the SARS-caring units would gradually diminish as a function of time and return to the level similar to that of the subjects in non-SARS units by the end of the study. Risk factors linked to SARS-related acute stress problems were also identified.",

Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables whenever appropriate. Pearson's linear correlations of mood and PTSD symptom ratings with attitude scale score were made at different times. Multiple logistic regression analyses were carried out to determine the risk factors associated with three psychiatric morbidities (depression, symptomatic PTSD, and insomnia) related to the SARS outbreak. Covariates such as work place (SARS vs. non-SARS unit), past history of mood disorders, age, marital status, years of clinical experience, having children, perceived negative feelings and positive attitudes were entered into the multivariate logistic regression models.

Only one report found that the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was up to 75.3% . The much higher rate was attributed to the shock elicited by the sudden, rapid spread of the disease from the northern part of Taiwan to the south without warning. At the time of the second SARS peak, these workers experienced fears and anxiety, and had little control over the infection. In contrast, the much lower rate (38.5%) of depression in our SARS unit nurses might be explained by using a different assessment tool and by the timing of the study, which was three weeks after the first peak of SARS infection in the northern part of Taiwan and apparently sufficient time to become more adjusted to caring for SARSinfected patients and feel less fearful. Their work environment was also more structured and safer than it had been during the first peak of the outbreak. Nevertheless, these SARS unit subjects still had a higher rate of depression than non-SARS unit subjects (3.1%). This difference was not as striking as the one for PTSD. Although symptomatic PTSD occurred more frequently in the SARS unit nurses (33%) than non-SARS unit nurses (18.7%), its prevalence rate in regular SARS unit (29.5%) and Neurology unit (26.7%) nurses was equal, implying that the psychological impact of the SARS outbreak on the latter (even though not working with SARS patients) might be significant. This higher symptomatic PTSD rate might have been because of uncertainty over being recruited into SARS patient care in T.-P. Su et al. / Journal of Psychiatric Research 41 (2007) 119-130 the near future. That nurses of CCU experienced the least PTSD symptoms (11.8%) might be explained by absence of this uncertainty. Overall, the prevalence of symptomatic PTSD for all nurses studied was 28.4%, which was equal to the rate of the quarantined group in Toronto (Hawryluck et al., 2004) but higher than the rates found by other studies (9.4-20%) (Sim et al., 2004; Chan and Huak, 2004) .

Our study found a robust effect of working in the SARS units, i.e., insomnia rate four-fold higher (37.1%) in the SARS units than in the non-SARS units (9.4%). Working in the regular SARS unit and SARS ICU resulted in 50% and 23% insomnia rate at the baseline and 41% and 15.4% at the end of the first week, respectively. On the other hand, no insomnia occurred at all in the initial phase for non-SARS unit nurses. High insomnia rate might be a better initial indicator than other mood changes of psychiatric morbidity stemming from SARS-care-related stress. The interpretation was more valid for regular SARS unit nurses than SARS ICU nurses, as the former were less experienced and worked in a less structured environment. Sleep quality differed between the four groups of nurses, with the poorest sleep quality being in the regular SARS unit nurses followed by the SARS ICU, Neurology, and CCU nurses. However, this striking stress-related marker disappeared on the second week and thereafter, suggesting that insomnia with poor sleep quality was a short and temporary response to stress. The duration of stress-induced insomnia is related to the magnitude of the stress and associated environmental factors. For instance, the Chi-Chi earthquake-induced elevation of insomnia rate in Taiwan lasted 3-6 months (unpublished data).",

Time effect indicates a gradual symptom (35-65%) reduction from baseline, which reflects greater psychological adaptation. The psychological adaptation of the SARS unit nurses might be related to increasing knowledge of the disease per se, increasing experience with managing SARS patients, decreasing perceived negative feelings, and continuous positive coping behavior over time. The group effect means that the SARS unit nurses were more symptomatic than the non-SARS unit nurses. The difference was significantly greater at the beginning than at the end of the study when no differences in symptoms between four groups were observed. One study found anxiety and worrying in the initial 2 weeks (chaotic condition) and depression and avoidance in the last 2 weeks (stable condition). Which of these symptoms occurred depended on the phase of the infection (initial vs. repair phase of the disease). In addition, this study was cross-sectional and the study groups in the initial and repair phase were not the same. Our study followed the same study subjects throughout the study and found anxiety, depression, PTSD, and insomnia in the initial 2 weeks but not in the latter phase. The initial appearance of these behavioral symptoms was mainly due to working in the SARS units and caring for SARS patients. The one exception (Neurology unit nurses who had a higher insomnia rate and poorer sleep quality after the third week than at baseline) may have been due to uncertainty over their work destination.",

Despite the high prevalence of symptomatic PTSD during the SARS outbreak, MINI found no PSTD. Incidence of MINI-diagnosed depressive disorder was also lower than symptomatic depression in the SARS units during the outbreak (11% vs. 38.5%, respectively). The discrepancy was thought to be due to fact that (1) the MINI diagnosis is retrospective and therefore less accurate because it is memory-dependent; (2) the MINI may fail to detect symptomatic PTSD that is acute, transient, and less severe, favoring the diagnosis of acute stress reaction; and (3) rate of questionnairebased diagnosis is much higher than that of face-to-face interview-based diagnosis. Despite these shortcomings, MINI may be the more valid diagnostic method to use over the entire study period. Therefore, when depressed (n = 12) and non-depressed SARS unit nurses (n = 58) were compared, the depressed group had greater depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances at entry and throughout the entire period. They remained mildly anxious and depressed and had high insomnia rate (50%) even at the end point. On the other hand, the level of mood and sleep disturbance in the non-depressed group was similar to that of the non-SARS unit group during the whole study, suggesting that the symptoms of the depressed group may account for most of the behavioral disturbances elicited in SARS unit nurses.

The dose effect was suggested by the greater psychiatric morbidity of SARS unit than non-SARS unit subjects. Clearly, nurses who provided SARS care faced a life threatening and uncertain situation and so became more symptomatic than their non-SARS counterparts. The effect of structure was suggested by the lower morbidity found in the subjects who worked in the more structured environment (i.e., the SARS ICU nurses). To our surprise, insomnia was less marked in nurses who took care of the more severely affected or intubated SARS patients than in nurses who cared for the less severely affected SARS patients. A similar relationship was observed in CCU vs. Neurology unit nurses. Explanations for this paradoxical finding may be (1) SARS is easier to deal with in an ICU and patients in ICU have fewer individual and emotional requirements; (2) the environment of SARS ICU is more structured, the work more routine, and the goals of patient care more certain; (3) all of the SARS ICU nurses were from the respiratory therapy care unit (RTCU), and therefore skilled in the care of patients with respiratory failure, while the regular SARS unit nurses came from different wards of the hospital rendering them more vulnerable to this heavy stress. The same explanations were also applicable to non-SARS units.",

            "text": "The most important risk factor linked to psychiatric morbidity and sleep disturbance in this study was contact with SARS patients. Two studies from Taiwan (Chen et al., 2005; Chong et al., 2004) , but none from Singapore concluded similarly (Sim et al., 2004; Chan and Huak, 2004) . One study (Chan and Huak, 2004) explained that all the suspect or probable cases of SARS were transferred immediately upon diagnosis to a SARS-designated hospital. The hospital studied was not the designated one, and only a small number of SARS patients were identified there. Perhaps the limited contact with SARS patients in that hospital resulted in failure to observe the link between psychiatric morbidity, sleep disturbance, and contact with SARS patients. The other study (Sim et al., 2004) suggested that the post-traumatic morbidity was a reflection of a complex psychosocial response, which was affected by not only direct exposure but also other contextual factors (Kroll, 2003) . Younger age (less than 30 years) was the risk factor in both ours and Sim's study (Sim et al., 2004) , while the length of work experience was not identified as a risk factor in other SARS studies (Sim et al., 2004; Chong et al., 2004) and in this study as well. In our study, previous history of mood disorders, positive attitude, and perceived negative feelings towards SARS were of particular interest. Previous studies had difficulty determining past history of mood disorders (Sim et al., 2004; Chan and Huak, 2004; Chong et al., 2004) . But it is certainly a predictor, and caution should be used when putting subjects with past psychiatric history in highly stressful situations. On the other hand, coping strategies and efforts were found to moderate the psychological impact of highly stressful conditions. Staff with psychiatric comorbidity coped more frequently by using strategies based on negative feelings such as fears (Maunder et al., 2003; Masur et al., 2003; Lew et al., 2003) , denial, and uncertainty (Maguire and Faulkner, 1988) . Fortunately, our staffs had negative perception only initially and their positive attitudes were maintained throughout the whole study.",

Third, since the study was conducted mainly in SARS unit in the general hospital setting, the findings may not generalizable to HCWs in other medical units as well as in the community such as family physician and local clinics. Also, it may not be applicable to male HCWs since all the study subjects are females in this special study. Fourth, the psychological adaptation seemed to occur as the epidemic declined.

To face future highly stressful biodisaster condition, selection of the caring medical staffs should be cautious, avoiding those who have past history of psychiatric disorder.
