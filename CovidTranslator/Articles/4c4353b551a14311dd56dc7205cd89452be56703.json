Until now, no data have been reported on the presence of hBoV in Belgium and the detection of hBoV in a multiplex Q-PCR setting has not been described. The aim of this study was to develop a fast and reliable multiplex Q-PCR for the simultaneous detection of hBoV DNA and adenovirus (AdV) DNA. During the winter of [2004][2005] 445 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were analysed from 404 Belgian children up to 5 years old with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). (Co)infections with hBoV, AdV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and influenza A virus were investigated. A viral agent was detected in 61% (n=272/445) of the NPAs. Multiplex Q-PCR found a prevalence of 11% (n=51/445) hBoV and 13% (n=58/445) AdV. Coinfections were more frequently found with AdV (62%; n=36/58) than with hBoV (49%; n=25/51). Follow-up samples were available from 22 patients with ARTIs. In three patients, hBoV DNA persisted for one month. Multiplex Q-PCR may help in closing the diagnostic gap by addressing a broader range of potential respiratory pathogens.",

Analysis of clinical samples from paediatric patients with ARTIs showed that the majority of the hBoV-positive samples had a low viral load.

Consistent with the literature, many hBoV coinfections (49%) were found in this study. However, the coinfection rate of AdV, a well-known respiratory pathogen, was even higher (62%). The causal role of hBoV in respiratory tract diseases is still a topic for debate. Koch's postulates from the 1890s cannot be used to establish the causal relationship of newly identified viruses because of the difficulty in culturing them. Cultureindependent criteria for evidence of causation are proposed by Fredericks and Relman [19] . Those criteria are correlated to the copy number of pathogen-associated nucleic acid sequences. Some authors suggested an association between high hBoV viral loads and hBoV being the sole virus detected in the respiratory tract, systemic dissemination of hBoV and the resolution of symptoms after decline of the hBoV DNAemia [3] . In this study, no significant difference in hBoV viral load between monoinfected and coinfected samples (P=0.3012) was found. However, the finding of the persistence of low hBoV viral loads after several months and the high coinfection rate suggests that a quantitative approach has to be considered when testing for hBoV.",

Studies frequently found hBoV in NPAs of hospitalised children with respiratory distress and abnormal chest radiography [7, [21] [22] [23] [24] . Lower respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup and asthma exacerbations were the prominent diseases. The most important symptoms were rhinorrhoea, fever, cough and wheezing. The diagnostic gap for respiratory infections is narrowing thanks to the extension of the list of potential viral pathogens. The broad range of potential aetiologic agents needs expanded surveillance [25] . Many newly identified viruses are not detectable with rapid antigen detection assays nor culture, e.g. coronavirus, polyomavirus and hBoV [6] . Multiplex Q-PCR may help in closing the diagnostic gap efficiently by addressing a broader range of potential pathogens. It is relatively fast for surveillance and outbreak investigation and is more sensitive than antigen detection. Since most current molecular diagnostics have a limited scope, a multiplex Q-PCR for the simultaneous detection of hBoV and AdV DNA was developed. In previous years when only RSV and influenza antigen testing were performed in this hospital, a pathogen was identified in less than 30% of ARTI cases [11] . In this study, the Q-PCR detection of RSV/hMPV RNA, influenza A virus RNA and hBoV/AdV DNA resulted in a diagnosis in 61% of the paediatric ARTIs. Using virus culture alone, Choi et al. found a potential aetiologic agent in 36% of children with ARTIs compared to 61% of the cases using PCRs targeting 11 viruses [6] . When a larger diagnostic panel of 16 respiratory viruses was analysed by Allander et al., a potential aetiologic agent was detected in up to 95% of the cases [7] .",
