            "text": "Acute viral bronchiolitis is a clinically diagnosed condition causing significant morbidity and mortality in infancy. Children typically have a prodrome of coryzal symptoms including rhinorrhea and fever and develop increased work of breathing with wheeze and cough. There may be difficulty feeding and very young infants may present with apnoea. It is the most common lower respiratory tract condition and most common cause of admission to hospital in the first 12 months of life. 1 Hospitalisation with bronchiolitis peaks between 3 and 6 months of life. 2 Most children have a self limiting illness and are managed in the community although around 1-3% of all infants require admission to hospital. Over the last 20 years there has been an increase in the number of children admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis which is unexplained and the cause is likely to be multifactorial although it is possible that the use of pulse oximetry is related to the increased admission rates. 3 Bronchiolitis is generally seasonal and associated with respiratory viral infections, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 4 Death from bronchiolitis is thought to be rare although the risk of death increases substantially with pre-existing medical conditions. 5 There are approximately 2.9 deaths per 100,000 population per year in infants infected with RSV and a respiratory cause of death under 12 months in the UK 6 Acute viral bronchiolitis remains a cause of substantial morbidity and health care costs in young infants. It is the most common lower respiratory tract condition and most common reason for admission to hospital in infants. Many respiratory viruses have been associated with acute viral bronchiolitis although respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains the most frequently identified virus. Most infants have a mild self limiting illness while others have more severe illness and require hospital admission and some will need ventilatory support. Differences in innate immune function in response to the respiratory viral insult as well as differences in the geometry of the airways may explain some of the variability in clinical pattern. Young age and history of prematurity remain the most important risk factors although male gender, indigenous status, exposure to tobacco smoke, poor socioeconomic factors and associated comorbidities such as chronic lung disease and congenital heart disease increase the risks of more severe illness. Supportive therapy remains the major treatment option as no specific treatments to date have been shown to provide clinically important benefits except for inhaled hypertonic saline. Prophylaxis of high risk infants with palivizumab should be considered although the cost effectiveness is still unclear. Many questions remain regarding optimal management approaches for infants requiring hospitalisation with bronchiolitis including use of nasogastric feeding, the optimal role of supplemental oxygen, optimal use of hypertonic saline and the role of combinations of therapies, the use of heliox or modern physiotherapy approaches. \u00df 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

While there is general agreement about the pattern of presentation there are differences internationally with regard to the importance of crackles and wheeze in making the diagnosis and in the age range recognised for diagnosis. In North America wheeze is regarded as a more important examination finding and the first 24 months of life are usually used for defining bronchiolitis. 10 Early presentations of asthma or wheeze with viral infections are thus likely to overlap with the diagnosis of bronchiolitis. In the United Kingdom the presence of inspiratory crackles is regarded as a more important examination finding and the first 12 months of life are usually used for making the diagnosis (http://www.sign.ac.uk). The differences in diagnostic criteria used have complicated the interpretation of both clinical trials and epidemiological studies.",

            "text": "The airway epithelium is the primary site of infection with respiratory viruses in bronchiolitis. The virus may directly damage the airway epithelium by infection with necrosis and cilial damage or indirectly by promoting inflammatory responses. This results in bronchiolar obstruction with oedema and accumulation of mucus and cellular debris in the airways which with increasing severity may go on to widespread airway occlusion which is the major finding in autopsy specimens. 4 Cilial damage can persist for many weeks or months following acute bronchiolitis. 4 There is a growing interest in the role of innate immune responses and risks of long term wheezing illness or more severe disease with bronchiolitis. 13 Innate immune responses are important in limiting the spread of respiratory viral infections within the lung and defects in some of the components of the innate immune system are associated with more severe disease. Low levels of interferon gamma and substance P in the airways have been associated with more severe disease in one study although how these findings led to more severe disease was unclear as there was no direct relationship found with viral load and theoretically low substance P levels should have been associated with reduced IL-9 secretion of mucus. 14 Infection of airway epithelial cells particularly with RSV or rhinovirus (RV) leads to activation of NF-kb pathway with induction of a variety of cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules and recruitment of particularly neutrophils but also dendritic cells, macrophages and lymphocytes into the airways. 13 Respiratory viruses stimulate different components of the innate immune system and some like RSV have evolved processes such as impairing apoptosis of infected airway epithelial cells to enhance viral replication. 15 ",

Rhinovirus (RV) is the next most commonly associated virus 16 although other viruses including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), 17 human bocavirus, 18 enteroviruses, adenovirus, influenza, human coronavirus and parainfluenza infection have also been associated with bronchiolitis. 16 More than one virus may be isolated from the same patient during an episode of bronchiolitis. Dual or even triple viral infections may be detected with RV and RSV being the most common dual infections. 16 There are conflicting data regarding the association between type of virus and disease severity with some studies suggesting rhinovirus 16 or RSV 19 may be associated with more severe disease. The effect of dual infections also appears to be unclear and there are conflicting studies regarding the effects of dual viral infections on disease severity with some studies suggesting concomitant infection with RSV and hMPV leads to more severe disease 20 while others have not found any increase in severity for dual infection with these viruses 21 or for concomitant RSV and RV. 19 The debate is further complicated by conflicting studies examining the association between increased severity and RSV subtype. 22, 23 The effects of viral load are also unclear as although viral load reduces over the course of the disease 24 some studies have reported an association between viral load and increased clinical severity 23 while others have not found such an association. 14 Concurrent severe bacterial infection is not thought to be common in infants with RSV bronchiolitis 25 although bacterial infection in the lower respiratory tract has been reported in severe disease. 26 One study examined endotracheal aspirates in infants requiring assisted ventilation with RSV positive bronchiolitis over three winters and found 70 out of 165 infants (around 42%) had bacteria detected on admission to paediatric intensive care with high bacterial colony counts (> 10 5 CFU/mL) in 36 out of 165 (21.8%) infants. 26 The most common bacterial pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneupmoniae although more unusual pathogens were also detected including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ventilation was longer for infants with bacterial co-infection (6 versus 4 days P < 0.01). 26 It is unclear however whether bacterial lower respiratory tract infection is causal or a marker for severe disease.",

Collection of nasopharyngeal samples with rapid detection of viral infection using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay / polymerase chain reaction (ELISA/PCR) testing has been shown to be cost effective in reducing hospital length of stay 30 and should be combined with appropriate cohorting and isolation of patients and the use of protective gowns and gloves for health care workers in contact with infected infants. Viral transmission for RSV is thought to be by direct contact with large droplets or fomites 31 and thus the mainstay of infection control is careful hand hygiene including hand washing and the use of alcohol rubs before and after contact with patients along with the use of aprons or gowns to avoid contamination of clothing and gloves for all those in contact with the infant or their surroundings. The number of viruses detected on nasopharyngeal testing varies depending on the local laboratory and many viral infections may be missed if the viruses are not looked for. Patients should be regarded as infectious for two weeks or until recognized viruses are negative on nasopharyngeal testing. 32 It is particularly important to avoid transmission of infection to high risk infants and children in hospital with other comorbidities who are at increased risk of severe disease and increased mortality from nosocomially acquired respiratory viral infection. In hospitals visitors with symptoms of viral infection should be restricted and health care workers with viral symptoms should avoid contact with high risk infants such as premature infants or infants with congenital heart disease or chronic lung disease.",

            "text": "As most studies have examined infants admitted to hospital it is difficult to separate risk factors for having bronchiolitis and risk factors for severe disease. The decision to admit to hospital is influenced by many different medical and social factors. In addition, because of difficulties in diagnostic criteria for bronchiolitis, some studies have examined admission rates with RSV infection as opposed to diagnosis of bronchiolitis as such. There are few population based studies although one recent large retrospective population study from the US examined the epidemiological features of incident bronchiolitis among 93 058 singleton births. 33 Many risk factors cannot be modified and these include age, gender and underlying medical conditions. Infants with older siblings have an increased risk of acquiring viral infections and are more likely to be admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis. 33 Males have an increased risk of bronchiolitis and also more severe disease with hospital admission which may be related to airway mechanics and having relatively smaller airways compared with females. 33 There is an increased risk of wheezing illness following RSV bronchiolitis although there is no convincing evidence of association with personal or family history of atopy and bronchiolitis. 34 Epidemiological studies from New Zealand, Australia and also USA have shown an association between ethnic background and risk of both bronchiolitis and more severe disease with admission to hospital for indigenous infants of Aboriginal, 35 Maori 36 or First Nation background. 33 Younger infants are more likely to be admitted to hospital than older infants with bronchiolitis and thus timing of birth in relation to the RSV season will affect the risk of requiring admission to hospital with RSV. Infants born prematurely ( 36 weeks gestation) are at increased risk for more severe disease and hospital admission with bronchiolitis. The risks of hospital admission with RSV infection were associated with gestational age in a study from Finland which reported a higher relative risk (RR) for hospital admission for infants born under 32 weeks gestation (RR 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.7-4.8) although the relative risk was still increased for infants born between 32-35 weeks gestation (RR 1.9, 95%CI 1.4-2.6). 37 Pre-existing disease increases the risk of death in infants with RSV infection. 5 Infants with chronic neonatal lung disease born under 32 weeks gestation have an increased risk of severe disease with RSV infection and admission to hospital with a hospital admission rate reported in one series of 19%, 38 and infants with underlying congenital anomalies 33 or chronic lung disease such as cystic fibrosis even born at term also have increased risk for more severe disease and admission to hospital. Infants with congenital heart disease have a higher risk of severe disease with RSV infection and account for around 6.4% of admissions in some cohort studies. 39 There are also risk factors that may be modified and these include exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, socioeconomic factors and protective factors such as breast feeding. Parental smoking is a recognized risk factor for hospital admission with bronchiolitis. There is some evidence to suggest both in utero exposure to tobacco from maternal smoking 33 and postnatal exposure are associated with an increased risk of hospital admission for bronchiolitis. 40 Poor socioeconomic factors, such as overcrowding and bedroom sharing may be associated with increased risk of transmission of respiratory viral infections are associated with an increased risk of admission with RSV infection. 41 In one small case control study the risk of hospital admission with bronchiolitis increased with socioeconomic deprivation score. 42 In a large epidemiological study, infants of mothers under 20 years of age had an increased risk of admission with bronchiolitis. 33 ",

Most infants have mild disease and can be safely managed at home. Families should be given adequate advice and information on how to recognise deterioration in their child's clinical status. Disease severity tends to worsen over the first 72 hours of the illness and the phase of illness should be considered in the decision for timing of review or admission to hospital. There should be a lower threshold for admission to hospital for infants with specific risk factors such as poor socio economic circumstances, a history of prematurity, congenital heart disease or chronic lung disease and geographical factors and transport difficulties also need to be carefully considered. Any of the following features should lead to further review and referral for hospital admission: 43 a history of apnoea difficulty feeding may require supportive care and if infants have taken less than 50% of their usual fluid intake in the preceding 24 hours hospital admission is required severe respiratory distress with accessory muscle use or grunting Respiratory rate greater than 60 diagnostic uncertainty cyanosis/ haemoglobin saturation 92% in room air Around 1-3% of infants may require admission to paediatric intensive care. Criteria for referral and admission to intensive care will vary between hospitals however infants with severe respiratory distress, exhaustion, failure to maintain haemoglobin saturation above 92-94% with supplemental oxygen or with recurrent apnoea should be considered for intensive care consultation.",

Rapid testing may be performed for RSV at the point of care and although it has been shown to have reduced sensitivity compared with laboratory testing it may facilitate appropriate cohorting strategies. Rapid virological testing has been shown to be cost effective and associated with reduced hospital stay, reduced use of antibiotic therapy, and reduced investigations 30 and may reduce antibiotic prescription in the community. 44 A chest X-Ray is not required in infants presenting with mild disease 45 and a typical clinical presentation although in infants with more severe illness or infants with atypical features where the diagnosis is unclear or in infants with particular risk factors a chest X-ray may be warranted.",
