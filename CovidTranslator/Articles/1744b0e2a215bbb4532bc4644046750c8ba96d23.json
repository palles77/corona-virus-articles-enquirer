One less virulent gC-strain, gC-39, was further studied to determine whether the neurovirulent phenotype could be restored by rescue of the gC gene using standard marker rescue cotransfection procedures. The resulting progeny contained 2% gC+ recombinant vii-ions and was tested for its ability to cause encephalitis. Although this progeny had increased virulence, it was not attributable to the acquisition of the gC gene since passive immunization of mice with a pool of anti-gC monoclonal antibodies had no effect on the development of encephalitis and only gC-viruses were isolated from diseased brain tissues. In agreement with these findings, individual plaque-purified gC positive (gC+) virus recombinants were shown not to have been restored to the wild-type virus level of neurovirulence. It is concluded that gC is not a virulence determinant in this mouse",

Several investigators have observed reduced ability of the virus to produce encephalitis or establish ganglionic latency in association with decreased levels of HSV thymidine kinase enzyme activity (Field and Darby, 1980; Sibrack et al., 1982; Stanberry et al., 1985; Tenser et al., 1985) . HSV intertypic recombinant viruses and different natural strains of HSV-1 with decreased neurovirulence have been partially restored to the pathogenic phenotype by marker rescue with specific DNA restriction fragments derived from virulent HSV-1 viruses (Rosen et al., 1985; Thompson et al., 1983 Thompson et al., , 1985 Thompson et al., , 1986 Larder et al., 1986; Javier et al., 1987) . However, the specific protein product(s) which contribute to virulence have not been identified. In addition, specific genes have been inactivated by deletion mutagenesis using the viral TK gene in mutant selection (Post and Roizman, 1981 ) and the mutant viruses tested for alterations in neurovirulence. This approach has shown that an immediate early gene, ICP22, is required for viral pathogenesis for the mouse central nervous system (Sears et al., 1985) .",

            "text": "Glycoproteins have been identified as virulence factors in studies of other viruses such as rabies (Dietzschold et al., 1983) and murine coronavirus (Fleming et al., 1986) . Among herpesviruses, glycoprotein g1, a pseudorabiesvirus structural component that plays a role in virus release, has been reported to be important to viral neurovirulence (Mettenleiter et al., 1987) . Although HSV encodes at least eight glycoproteins (Spear, 1985) , their role in neuropathogenesis is largely unexplored. Only three of these, gB, gD, and gH, are known to be required for virus production (Sarmiento et al., 1979; Gompels and Minson, 1986) and thus far only gB has been implicated in viral pathogenesis (Ktimel et al., 1985; Weise et al., 1987) . The consistent presence in clinical isolates of the remaining glycoproteins that are nonessential for virus production in cell culture indicates that they must play a role in the virus life cycle in vivo and may contribute to viral pathogenesis. In support of this view, Weber et al. (1987) have shown that a HSV-1 mutant carrying a chain terminating Tn5 insertion in the gene encoding glycoprotein G has reduced neuro-virulence in mice. HSV-1 gE (Para et al., 1982) and g1 (Johnson and Feenstra, 1987) have been associated with virus-specific binding activity for the Fc component of IgG. Evidence that binding of nonimmune IgG to infected cell membranes can protect these cells from cytolytic immune mechanisms (Adler et al., 1978) suggests that this activity may alter immune recognition of the virus in vivo. Glycoprotein C plays a central role in the induction of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses during infection (Oakes et al., 1980; Glorioso et al., 1985; Marlin et al., 1985; Kumel et al., 1985; Nash et al., 1985; Rosenthal et al., 1987) and has the unique property of functioning as a receptor for the C,b component of complement (Friedman et al., 1984 (Friedman et al., , 1986 . This activity has been shown to interfere with activation of the alternative complement pathway (Fries et al., 1986) , suggesting that gC may act as an important virulence determinant by protecting virus from complement-mediated anti-viral host defense mechanisms. In agreement with these predictions, the presence of gC in virion envelopes of infected cell membranes can interfere with complement-dependent virus neutralizing cytolytic antibodies (Mc-Neamy et al., 1987) .",

Rather, it was the gC-virions within the cotransfection progeny that had acquired the more pathogenic phenotype. These results were confirmed by an experiment showing virulence had not been restored to the gC+ recombinants.

BSC-1 monolayers were cotransfected with infectious gC-39 DNA and a chimeric plasmid containing an HSV-1 KOS-321 restriction fragment spanning the gC gene by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method described by Graham and Van der Eb (1973) and modified for use in our laboratory (Sand+Goldin et al., 1981) . The construction of plasmids pFH60 and pFH60-ESt65 used in the cotransfections has been reported (Holland et al., 1984) . Plasmids were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes to excise the viral insert before use in cotransfections. Following incubation of cells with the cotransfecting DNA for 4 h, the cells were shocked with 25% DMSO to increase membrane permeability. Virus progeny plaques from cotransfections were examined for the presence of gC+ virions using the immunoperoxidase staining technique, the \"black plaque\" assay (Holland et al., 1983a) . Anti-gC antibody in the assay was a pool of monoclonal antibodies (Holland et al., 1984) . Rescue frequency was determined by comparing the proportion of black plaques (gC') to white plaques (gC-) on cell monolayers counterstained with crystal violet. Approximately 2000 plaques were counted to determine the percent rescue. Viable gCf virus was isolated from black plaques stained in the absence of glutaraldehyde fixation of infected cell monolayers (Johnson et al., 1986) . Each isolate was plaque-purified three times and the black plaque assay repeated on each stock to confirm the gC+ phenotype.",

It is possible that the gC strains are not genetically the same in other loci, which in combination with the absence of gC, might result in reduced neurovirulence. That is, the absence of gC would only affect neuro~rulence in the context of particular alleles in other viral genes. Alte~atively, the more virulent gC-mutants might possess other virulence factors that compensate for their lack of gC. To explore these possibilities, the gC gene in a strain with reduced neurovirulence, gC-39, was restored by marker rescue using a cloned restriction fragment carrying the wild-type gC gene. If restoration to the gC+ phenotype also restored virulence to the wild-type level, then it might be concluded that gC contributes to neurovi~len~e, but only OR a particular genetic background. Fig. 1A . Vial titers of gC+ (+ -+) and gC-(0 -0) virus from pooled brain homogenates from three surviving mice/day. Cumulative mortality rate for twenty &week-old female DBA/'L mice inoculated intracerebrally with IO4 PFU/mouse of cotransfection progeny derived from cotransfection of gC-39 with gC-39 DNA and plasmid pFH60 containing the wild-type KOS gC gene (O------0). Cumulative mortality rate for 10 mice injtxted with 10\" PFU/mouse of the gC7 deletion mutant, gC-39 (A------A). The mutant gC-39 had a 200-fold reduction in virulence (LD,, = 104.5 PFU/mouse, data not shown) in comparison to KOS-321 and sustains a 1.7 kb deletion of the gC structural gene (Homa et al., 1986) , ensuring that spontaneous reversion to the gC+ phenotype would not occur. Cotransfection of infectious gC-39 DNA with pFH60, a clone containing the KOS gC gene and flanking sequences was performed and a rescue frequency of 2% gC+ virus plaques was observed among the progeny. As expected, control cotransfections with gC-39 DNA and pFH60-Est65, containing a KOS fragment that does not overlap the deletion in gC-39, did not result in any gC+ virus recombinants.",

To confirm this hypothesis, mice were passively immunized with monoclonal antibodies against gC and inoculated 24 h later with the cotransfection progeny. This procedure would inhibit the replication and spread of gC+ virus through the brain and could distinguish between neurovirulent gC-and gC+ virus in the cotransfection progeny. The cumulative mortality rate was 80% (8/10) for immunized mice receiving the cotransfection progeny ( Fig. 2A) and was not significantly different from the 90% cumulative mortality rate (18/20) in unimmunized animals (Fig. 1A) . However, only gC-virions were found in brains of immunized mice inoculated with the cotransfection progeny by day 2 post-inoculation ( Fig. 2A) . Titers of gC-virus increased rapidly and were similar to those from nonimmunized animals (Fig. 1A ) throughout the 5 day post-inoculation period. As expected, the cumulative mortality rate in immunized mice inoculated with gC-39 (40%, 4/10; Fig. 2A ) was essentially the same as seen in nonimmunized mice (30%, 3/10; Fig. 1A ). These results clearly showed that the gC-virions were responsible . for the increased virulence of the cotransfection progeny. In contrast, the cumulative mortality rate in passively immunized mice inoculated with the mixture of 2% KOS and 98% gC-39 was only 10% (l/10; Fig. 2B ), compared to 55% (11/20) in nonimmunized animals (Fig. 1B) . This indicated that the gC+ KOS-321 virions in the reconstruction mixture, although only a small proportion of the total population, contributed significantly to the deaths of the nonimmunized mice.

Here, further studies were carried out in an attempt to confirm that glycoprotein C of HSV-1 is a virulence determinant using a lethal mouse model of encephalitis. The wide variability in virulence among nine gC mutants derived from KOS-321 was unexpected because they were all selected for resistance to monoclonal antibodies against gC from the same parental virus stock. Thus, there was no known selection pressure on any other virus genes. Even the three gC-mutants with identical deletions of the gC gene showed variation in virulence. The lack of a consistent correlation between mortality rates and the absence of gC implied that HSV-1 gC is not an essential virulence factor. In agreement with this conjecture, marker rescue of a gC-deletion mutant was not successful in restoring virulence to the gC+ recombinants.",

            "text": "The increased virulence of gC-virions from the cotransfection progeny presumably resulted from transfection-induced mutations in genes coding for unknown virulence factors. Other investigators have also reported increases in virulence of HSV following transfection of viral DNA. Thompson et al. (1986) studied an isolate related to HSV-1 KOS-321, designated KOS (M), which is virulent only by the intracerebral route and not via footpad inoculation. They reported that transfection of KOS (M) DNA without a cotransfecting fragment resulted in increased neurovirulence in lo-20% of transfection progeny when tested by footpad inoculation. This presumably occurred by inducing mutations at unknown loci (Thompson et al., 1986) . Schriider and Ktimel (1986) similarly reported increased virulence among 10% of HSV-1 DNA transfections. In other experimental genetic systems, transfection has been shown to produce multiple mutations in shuttle plasmid vectors (Calos et al., 1983; Razaque et al., 1983) . Our results indicating increased virulence of gC-HSV following transfection suggest that results of virulence studies using this technique should be carefully controlled and interpreted with caution. Our approach to the identification of viral recombinants differed from that of other investigators. For example, Thompson et al. (1983a Thompson et al. ( , 1983b screened cotransfection progeny for neurovirulence in mice, plaque-purified the virus recovered from brain tissues, and then reinoculated mice for LDsO determinations. Virulent cotransfection progeny virions were examined for evidence of recombination with the cotransfected fragment from the virulent HSV-1 parent only after passage through animals. In contrast, our experiments avoided prior in vivo passage of the transfection progeny by utilizing monoclonal antibodies in the immunoperoxidase plaque assay to identify and recover individual gC+ recombinants. Monoclonal antibodies also allowed us to measure the proportions of gC+ and gC-virions in brain tissue post-inoculation and to perform experiments with a reconstructed gC'/gC virion mixture. In addition, passive immunization experiments with monoclonal antibodies selectively eliminated recombinant gC+ virions from the central nervous system and allowed us to conclusively demonstrate that the gCvirions were responsible for the increased virulence of the cotransfection progeny. Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies should be a useful technique for studying the role of other HSV encoded proteins expressed on infected cell membranes as virulence factors.",
