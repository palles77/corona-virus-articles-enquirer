Patients with H5N1 disease had unusually high serum concentrations of chemokines (eg, interferon induced protein-10 [IP-10] and monokine induced by interferon \u2425 [MIG]). Taken together with a previous report that H5N1 influenza viruses induce large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines from macrophage cultures in vitro, our findings suggest that cytokine dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of H5N1 disease. Development of vaccines against influenza A (H5N1) virus should be made a priority. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus subtype H5N1 caused disease in 18 patients with six deaths in Hong Kong in 1997. This outbreak was the first documented instance of a purely avian influenza virus causing severe respiratory illness in human beings. 1, 2 Here, we report the re-emergence of human H5N1 disease and discuss the possible pathogenesis of the disease.",

The exact cause of death could not be ascertained since the girl was buried in mainland China. The family returned to Hong Kong on Feb 9, 2003. The father, a 33-year-old with previous good health, was admitted on Feb 11, 2003, with a 4-day history of fever, malaise, sore throat, cough with blood-stained sputum, and bone pain. He had a lymphocyte count of 0\u00b76\u03eb10 9 /L (normal range 1\u00b75-4\u00b70\u03eb10 9 /L) and radiological evidence of right lower-lobe consolidation. Bacteriological investigations including sputum and blood cultures and acid-fast stain of sputum were unremarkable. Despite treatment with intravenous cefotaxime and oral clarithromycin, clinical and radiological signs showed that the patient was deteriorating. 2 days after admission, oral oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) was added to his treatment regimen. The patient was electively intubated because of progressive respiratory distress, but his condition worsened and he died 6 days after admission.",

Our results confirmed that the virus had the multibasic aminoacid motif associated with HPAI viruses and that the haemagglutinin had high homology to the H5 haemagglutinin of the H5N1 virus isolated in 1997. 2 We measured serum cytokine and chemokine concentrations (Cytometric Bead Assay from BD Biosciences, San Diego CA, USA) in our two patients. Cytokine concentrations in early (day 1-3 of illness) and late (day 9-10) serum samples from six other adults with influenza-three with influenza A and three with influenza B-and five serum samples from healthy adults were used for comparison (table). Serum concentrations of interferon induced protein-10 (IP-10) and monokine induced by interferon \u2425 (MIG) in patients with uncomplicated human influenza A or B were high early in the illness, but fell to within normal range by day 9-10 after disease onset. By contrast, serum IP-10 and MIG concentrations in our 33-year-old patient were higher (ie, a difference greater than 2 SD from the mean) than in patients with uncomplicated influenza A or B disease and these concentrations continued to increase. On the third day of illness, the 8-year-old patient also had higher serum concentrations of IP-10 and MIG than did patients with uncomplicated influenza; but these high concentrations dropped by day 5 of illness. Of note is that the control patients with influenza were all adults and we had no agecomparable controls for the 8-year-old boy.",

However, we have shown previously that H5N1 virus isolated from humans in 1997 are able to induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF \u2423, type 1 interferons 4 and IP-10 (unpublished data) from macrophages infected in vitro; we have postulated that immune dysregulation has a part in pathogenesis of this disease. 4 TNF \u2423 and interferons are early-phase cytokines that act locally to trigger a cascade of other cytokines including IP-10, interleukin 1, and interleukin 6. IP-10 is a macrophage chemoattractant and its presence might explain the prominent macrophage inflammatory infiltrate in the lung ( figure 1) . Secretion of MIG is induced by interferon \u2425 released from activated T helper cells as well as TNF \u2423 and it indicates the activation of the Th-1 pathway. Taken together with the in-vitro data that H5N1 viruses greatly stimulate cytokine release, the unusually high concentrations of IP-10 and MIG in serum could be the result of a massive overall induction of cytokines such as TNF \u2423 within the microenvironment of the lung, thus contributing to disease pathogenesis. Although TNF \u2423 was undetectable in serum, we did note evidence of its expression in epithelial cells of the alveoli (figure 2). Deaths associated with primary human influenza (H3N2 or H1N1) pneumonia are uncommon and, thus, currently we do not know whether these patients show ennhanced TNF \u2423 expression within pneumocytes.",

W C Yu, S T Lai, C W Leung, and T K Ng investigated the patients and compiled the clinical data; C Y Cheung carried out the cytokine assays; W F Ng and J M Nicholls were responsible for the autopsy and immunohistochemical studies, and Y Guan, W L Lim and K H Chan did the virological studies. K Y Yuen and J M Nicholls contributed to study design, critical analysis of the data, and writing the manuscript. Infection with two strains of HIV-1 has implications for understanding HIV transmission and vaccine development; however, frequency and pathogenic consequences of dual infection are unknown. We assessed 64 patients for dual infection with heteroduplex mobility assay, viral sequencing, and phylogenetic methods. HIV disease outcomes were available in 34 patients. Five of these with AIDS endpoints had dual infection with HIV-1: four were cases of coinfection and one was superinfection. In all five, time from seroconversion to clinical AIDS or to CD4+ T-cell count less than 200 cells per L was very rapid (<3\u00b74 and <3\u00b71 years, respectively). Our findings should prompt larger studies to assess the effect of dual infection at the population level. Occurrence of infection with more than one strain of HIV-1 has important implications for understanding HIV transmission and for AIDS vaccine development 1 and has led to many instances of recombinant viral strains of global epidemiologic relevance. 2 However, frequency and pathogenic consequences of dual infection are largely unknown. 1,2 Dual HIV-1 infection can be the result of either coinfection, with two viral variants infecting at or near the same time and before seroconversion, or superinfection, in which primary infection with one viral variant precedes infection with a second viral variant at some time after seroconversion. Many reports have been published of people dually infected with HIV-1 and HIV-2, with different HIV-1 groups, with different sequence subtypes from the HIV-1 M group, and with divergent members of the same subtype, and several reports of superinfection. 1 However, these studies did not address disease outcomes.",
