We used this system to determine the presence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in serum and plasma samples obtained from patients at King Fahd Hospital of the University in Alkhobar, Saudi Arabia. The hospital is a referral hospital that serves the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, including the Dammam and Alhasa governorates, from which several MERS cases were reported, according to the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia and a recent study (6) ; no MERS patients were seen at King Fahd Hospital.

None of the samples robustly inhibited VSV-G-dependent entry, whereas most samples markedly reduced entry-driven by NL63-S (Figure 1 ), as expected (7). Experiments using serum samples of known neutralizing capacity confirmed that our neutralization experiments were sensitive and specific ( Figure 2 ). Thus, serum samples obtained from a patient infected with MERS-CoV potently inhibited MERS-S but not VSV-G-or NL63-S-driven entry, whereas the reverse observation was made with serum samples reactive against NL63-S ( Figure 2 ). In sum, none of the samples from children with respiratory infections and none of the samples from healthy adult men showed detectable amounts of MERS-S-neutralizing antibodies, but most neutralized NL63-S-driven host cell entry.",

Our analysis of samples from children might have underestimated seroprevalence We cannot rule out that other diagnostic methods that are not limited to detection of neutralizing antibodies might have identified positive samples in our collection. Future analyses are required to determine MERS-CoV seroprevalence in larger patient collectives and in animal species, such as dromedary camels, that could transmit the virus to humans (4,11).

Transduction efficiency was measured by quantification of luciferase activities in cell lysates and is shown relative to transduction of cells in the absence of serum, which was set at 100%. All 110 plasma samples available were tested for neutralization of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein (MERS-S)-dependent transduction; subsets were also tested for neutralization of transduction driven by the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) (46/110) and the S protein of human coronavirus NL63 (NL63-S) (46/110).
