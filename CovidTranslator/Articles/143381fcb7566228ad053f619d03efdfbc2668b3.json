In addition to merely the residues/ nucleotides, biologists often possess more knowledge regarding function, structure or conserved patterns of the sequences to be analyzed. It is generally desirable to have such information incorporated into an alignment procedure, so that the alignment result can be more biologically meaningful. For example, functionally important sites are generally expected to be aligned together, but a typical alignment tool often fails to achieve this if the sequence similarity is low. Imposing constraints representing such information turns out to be an effective manner to incorporate biological knowledge into an alignment tool.",

Using H, K, H as constraints, in the resulting constrained alignment each of these three residues can be found aligned together in a column of the alignment, appearing in the order as specified. Chin et al. (3) then proposed an improved algorithm for pairwise alignment and an approximation algorithm for multiple alignment.

The meaning of this pattern is that, the first residue is Cys, followed by one residue of any kind, then a Cys, followed by two residues of any kind, then a Gly or Pro, etc. Regular expressions are also convenient in describing variable ranges between patterns or between blocks within a pattern, which is necessary for some single patterns themselves, and useful in applications where different patterns are expected to exhibit proximity in their occurrences. In the above example of EGF_2, the 'x(4,8)' symbol preceding the last Cys indicates a range of length varying from 4 to 8 between a residue of [F, Y or W] (Phe, Tyr or Trp) and that last Cys.

It can be noted that the constraint formulation of DIALIGN and the one of RE-MuSiC are significantly different. In DIALIGN, a constraint consists of the exact positions of a pair of equal-length segments on two of the sequences, where these two segments are expected to be aligned together. Conflicts of constraints, if any, are resolved according to a weight function defined on the segment pairs. This formulation is more similar to the one of Myers et al. (6) . On the other hand, in RE-MuSiC, a constraint is a regular expression pattern. Each pattern may occur many times in a sequence, where each occurrence needs not have the same length.

Unfortunately, the time complexity is extremely high, involving an exponential multiplicative factor in addition to the exponential time complexity for optimal (unconstrained) MSA computations. Even for pairwise alignment with multiple constraints, its worst case time and space requirements are intensive. In addition, the algorithms in (23, 24) cannot find in the resulting alignment the regions responsible for the satisfactions of the constraints; only the alignment score, without the alignment itself, is reported.

In this work we extend the algorithm in (25) to support multiple constraints and multiple sequences, as required in RE-MuSiC.

The chemical natures of their residues acting as G-site ligands and interactions facilitated with glutathione are also analogous (26) . In a reasonable alignment of GST protein sequences, therefore, the residues for the G-site are expected to be aligned together. A structural superposition of the crystal structures of GST proteins from different species also suggests that most of these G-site residues should be aligned together (26) . The sequence identity of those GST proteins from different species, however, is quite low; for example, it is reported in (26) that the pairwise sequence identity between the A. thaliana GST and each of other six non-plant GSTs is no more than 20.2%. In such a case, interfered by the low-similarity regions, it would be difficult for a typical alignment tool to align the important residues well. An experiment is therefore undertaken to examine the performance of a typical alignment tool in this case, as well as to demonstrate how RE-MuSiC can be used to produce a more reasonable alignment.",

These sequences are first aligned using ClustalW (27) . The result is shown in Figure 2a , where active site residues shared by these GSTs are boxed. It can be seen that, part of the G-site residues failed to be aligned together, due to the low sequence similarity among these GST proteins. By querying PROSITE with the three proteins, it is found that they all share the pattern PS00006 ([ST]-x(2)- [DE] ). Using this pattern as constraint, RE-MuSiC is applied to align the sequences again. The result is shown in Figure 2b . As expected, the common pattern is aligned together. Meanwhile, the G-site residues are aligned properly, as desired. These suggest that, with some information about common patterns, RE-MuSiC is more reliable to produce alignments in which biologically important residues can be lined up, which is particularly important when the sequence identity is low. Being more reliable in aligning together important residues, RE-MuSiC may also be applied to align an unknown sequence with other sequences whose relevant residues are known, thus providing a convenient and cheap way for a preliminary prediction of the residues in question on the unknown sequence. Note also that, in this experiment, the knowledge about the active site residues are not utilized in constructing the alignment; the constraints do not involve the active site residues themselves.

The shaded regions, corresponding to the phylogenetically conserved pseudoknots, are not aligned well. (b) A partial view of the alignment produced by RE-MuSiC. The consensus of the pseudoknots on the four coronaviruses involves variable ranges between residues. RE-MuSiC has a constraint formulation flexible enough to express this consensus. As expected, the regions for the pseudoknots are aligned properly by RE-MuSiC. For both tools, the default parameter settings are adopted. the phylogenetically conserved pseudoknots (shaded regions) are not aligned well. In (28) , predicted secondary structures of the pseudoknots found in the 3 0 -UTR of various coronaviruses are given. A consensus of the pseudoknots is to be taken. Since, in general, loops in pseudoknots are less conserved, to enhance flexibility, we exclude loop regions nucleotides from the consensus. Then the consensus of the pseudoknots can be described as 'x(5)-C-U-x(4)-C-x(15,16)-U-G-x(2)-A-x(5,7)-G-x(4)-A-G-x(7,10)-U-x(3)-A-x (5) .' Using this consensus as the constraint, RE-MuSiC is applied to align these 3 0 -UTR sequences again. In Figure 3b , the pseudoknot regions on these coronaviruses can be seen to have been aligned properly. This demonstrates that RE-MuSiC can be used to help locate fragments that are conserved in structure. Actually, this property, being a common advantage of the MuSiC series, had been utilized to predict the pseudoknot in the 3 0 -UTR of the SARS-TW1 coronavirus by aligning the 3 0 -UTR of SARS-TW1 with those of some other coronaviruses whose pseudoknot regions are known (15, 16) . RE-MuSiC further makes it possible to provide the flexibility of variable ranges between conserved nucleotides or regions in constraints, which is necessary for describing the whole consensus of the pseudoknot in this experiment. This is a significant advance over previous generations of MuSiC.",
