However, its mechanism and the relationship between elevated serum immunoglobulin D (IgD) and the clinical features of HIDS are unclear. In this study, we generated by fusion PCR a vector to express high levels of chimeric secretory IgD (csIgD) specifically in the liver. We then generated seven founder lines of transgenic mice by co-microinjection, and verified them using genomic PCR and Southern blotting. We detected the expression of csIgD by reverse transcription PCR, quantitative PCR, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We demonstrated that csIgD could be specifically and stably expressed in the liver. We used flow cytometry to show that overexpression of csIgD in the bone marrow and spleen cells had no effect on B cell development. Morphologic and anatomical observation of the transgenic mice revealed skin damage, hepatosplenomegaly, and nephromegaly in some transgenic mice; in these mice, pathological sections showed high levels of cell necrosis and protein-like sediments in the liver, spleen, and kidney. We demonstrated that the genomic insertion sites of the transgenes did not disrupt the MVK gene on mouse chromosome 5. This transgenic mouse will be useful to explore the pathogenesis of HIDS.",

It was originally described in patients of Dutch ancestry by Van der Meer et al. in 1984 [4] but has now been reported all over the world, including in Japan [5, 6] . Its pathogenesis is unknown and there are no effective therapies. High levels of IgA and tumor necrosis factor al-pha (TNF-\u03b1) are found in the sera of some HIDS patients [7] . Patients with HIDS also secrete large amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), which may be connected with low levels of isoprenoid metabolic end products caused by a lack of mevalonate kinase (MVK) [8] .",

[9] obtained samples from 34 patients and 44 unaffected members from 16 families with HIDS who originated from the Netherlands (8), France (5), the United Kingdom (1), Spain (1), and the Czech Republic (1). An MVK gene missense mutation resulting in decreased MVK activity was identified. Reduced MVK activity in fibroblasts suggested that the MVK mutation caused HIDS. Since then, other MVK gene mutations or deletions have been found in some HIDS patients [10, 11] . MVK is a protease in the cytoplasm that participates in the synthesis of cholesterol and non-sterol isoprenoid. Human MVK is located on chromosome 12q24. The V377I mutation in MVK occurs homozygously in approximately 20% of HIDS patients and heterozygously in most of the others. The second most common mutation is I268T [12, 13] .",

These authors reported significantly increased IgD levels, and a trend towards higher IgA and TNF-\uf061 levels, in Mvk +/\uf02d sera compared with Mvk +/+ littermate sera, which was accompanied by periodic fever and hepatosplenomegaly. Moreover, Ammouri et al. [15] reported that, among fifty HIDS patients, 38 had high serum IgD, even though only 19 were homozygotes or composite heterozygotes for MVK mutations. This indicates that secretory IgD (sIgD) plays an important role in the clinical presentation of HIDS. The function of sIgD is unclear, although it has been reported to combine with antigens of microorganisms and their products. In early inflammatory responses in patients with contact dermatitis, sIgD could induce bone marrow cells-mainly neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils--to migrate to the skin [16] . sIgD binds to basophils through a calcium-mobilizing receptor that induces antimicrobial and B cell-stimulating factors, after IgD cross-linking. sIgD is an important immune-conditioning molecule; its interaction with its binding partners induces cell activation, organization penetration, immune activation factor release, and enhances other immune defenses. However, excess activation can lead to inflammation and tissue destruction [17] ; the effects and levels of increased sIgD vary among HIDS patients [18] .",

Recent reports of HIDS [22\uf02d25] have caused researchers to re-examine sIgD, but its specific role in HIDS is still not clear. To facilitate this research, we generated a mouse model that stably and efficiently expresses sIgD. In this study, we found that csIgD could be expressed in the liver of mice under the control of the Alb enhancer and promoter. The mouse Alb promoter contains six cis-acting elements [20] , which bind hepatocyte nuclear factor 1, CCAAT-binding protein, D-binding protein, leucine chlorolactamase, nuclear factor Y, and NF-1, respectively, and thus initiate gene transcription in the liver [26, 27] . In addition, enhancers located 10.4-8.5 kb upstream can increase promoter activity 50-fold [28] [29] [30] . The sIgD expression was increased in different degrees in individual mice. Most mice carried both transgenes and most transgenic founders transmitted both transgenes to their offspring. This is consistent with previous reports that co-microinjection normally leads to the co-integration of two transgenes into a single chromosomal site [31, 32] . The expression of sIgD showed that the gene copy number was not directly proportional to the level of gene expression. This is consistent with previous studies indicating that the transgene integration sites reflect gene expression levels better than does the copy number [33] . Deletion of a single Mvk allele in the mouse was able to increase sIgD 9-12-fold compared with negative control mice [14] . We inserted the target gene into the multiple cloning site of pcDNA3.1(+) to construct a high-expression sIgD transgenic mouse model, and expression of the transgenes could be detected by RT-PCR in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, intestine, brain, and muscle (data not shown). The lack of increase in serum sIgD may be for one of the three following reasons. First, the variable region of csIgD was derived from human rather than mouse IgG1, which may affect the spatial structure of the molecule and result in the affact of its identification by the antibody. Second, while we used the kappa light chain to construct csIgD, sIgD preferentially uses the lambda light chain [34, 35] , with the kappa light chain used for membrane IgD [36, 37] . This might also affect the secretion and detection of csIgD. Finally, sIgD might have increased in serum but then have been rapidly degraded through a protective mechanism, making the increase undetectable. Further studies are needed to explain why we did not achieve stable and efficient expression of sIgD.",

This indicates that the inflammation in the transgenic mice is caused by increased sIgD rather than by Mvk mutation. sIgD has a proinflammatory function, and can effectively induce antimicrobial, immunostimulating, and proinflammatory factors such as IL-1\uf062, TNF-\uf061, IL-8, and CXCL10 [38] . Mucosal IgD can enhance local immunity by epithelial transport whereas cir-culating IgD binds to basophils through a calcium-mobilizing receptor. In addition to quickly mediating an innate immune response, IgD also conducts immune signaling when bacteria invade. When IgD-bound basophils encounter antigen, they migrate to the lymphoid system or mucosal immune lymphoid organ driven by chemokines that are released by mast cells under IgD stimulation. Basophils are organized through a calcium-mobilizing receptor that induces antimicrobial, opsonizing, inflammatory, and B cell-stimulating factors to enhance immune protection, and they induce an extreme immune response that leads to lesion destruction. Skin ulcers in transgenic mice with high expression of sIgD may be caused by excessive immune activation. In addition, displayed severe hepatosplenomegaly and renomegaly. These diseased organs had a high degree of cell necrosis and fiber-like protein precipitation--similar to states seen in human HIDS [5, [22] [23] [24] [25] 39] . However, further studies are required to prove the usefulness of these transgenic mice as a model of HIDS.",
