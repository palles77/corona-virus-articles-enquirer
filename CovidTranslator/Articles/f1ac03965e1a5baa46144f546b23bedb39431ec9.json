The more acute the disease process, the more likely that nystagmus and ataxia are present. In vestibular ataxia, the animal leans, drifts, falls or rolls toward the side of the lesion. The nystagmus can be resting or positional (induced by holding the head in full extension), and, vertical, horizontal or rotatory in direction. The direction may change in time. Pendular nystagmus (oscillatory with rapid, short excursions) is not a sign of vestibular disease.",
