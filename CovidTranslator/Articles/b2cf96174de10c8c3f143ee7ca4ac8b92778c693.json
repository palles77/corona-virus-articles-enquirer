The RT-LAMP assay is highly sensitive and able to detect 4.67 \u00d7 10 0 copies of BVDV RNA. Additionally, the RT-LAMP method is capable of detecting both genotypes of BVDV. No cross-reaction with other bovine viruses was observed. The ability of RT-LAMP to detect BVDV RNA from bovine fecal swabs was also evaluated. Of the 88 fecal swabs, 38 were found to be positive by RT-LAMP assay, whereas 39 were positive by real-time RT-PCR. Taken together, the BVDV specific RT-LAMP method is highly specific and sensitive and can be used as a rapid and direct diagnostic assay for testing clinical samples.",

            "text": "Identification of persistently infected calves, in combination with a proper vaccination program, is essential to the successful control of BVDV. The currently available diagnostic methods for BVDV include virus isolation, immunoassay, electron microscopy (EM), nuclei acid hybridization, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Deregt et al., 2002; Ridpath et al., 2002; Fulton et al., 2006; Youssef, 2006) . Although RT-PCR is a highly sensitive and specific test for detecting BVDV RNA, it has the intrinsic disadvantage of requiring a high-precision instrument such as a thermocycler for amplification and a time-consuming and complicated detection method (gel electrophoresis unit). In recent years, many studies have demonstrated the potential application of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or reverse transcription (RT)-LAMP assay for rapid detection of viral DNA or RNA (Parida et al., 2004; Enomoto et al., 2005; Cho et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2008; Komiyama et al., 2009; Rovira et al., 2009; Fan et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2010) . Like RT-PCR, the RT-LAMP technique amplifies the target viral RNA sequence (Notomi et al., 2000) . In this study, a RT-LAMP assay for detection of BVDV RNA is developed. Since the 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) of BVDV is among the most conserved regions and has been chosen as a preferred target region for detection of BVDV RNA by RT-PCR (Letellier et al., 1999; Fan et al., 2010) , a set of six primers was designed to amplify 6 target sequences at the 5 UTR of the BVDV genome for the RT-LAMP assay. The positions of the primers are based on the nucleotide sequence of Oregon CV24 (GenBank accession no. AF0911605.1). a Each inner primer of RT-LAMP contains two connected primers. The R and Y are shown in red color.",

BVDV reference strains, field isolates, and other bovine pathogens BVDV reference strains, field isolates, and other bovine pathogens used in the study are listed in Table 1 . Three BVDV genotype 1 (BVDV1) reference strains, 13 BVDV1 field isolates, and 1 BVDV genotype 2 (BVDV2) reference strain were used to develop and optimize the RT-LAMP conditions. The BVDV reference virus strains were propagated in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Shijiqing, China, free of BVDV and antibody to BVDV). Thirteen field isolates were isolated from calves with typical BVDV clinical signs such as diarrhea, miscarriages and stillborn. For virus isolation, a total of 1 g of fresh aseptically collected liver tissues was homogenized in 4 ml of phosphatebuffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2). A 1:10 dilution of the supernatants was then inoculated onto MDBK monolayer cultures and incubated for 6 days. The presence or absence of cytopathic effect was recorded. After 3 times of freezing and thawing, culture supernatants were collected after centrifugation and stored at \u221270 \u2022 C for further characterization with indirect immunoperoxidase (IPX) test and electron microscopy (EM). All 13 field isolates were BVDV positive as revealed by both positive IPX staining and the typical BVDV morphology (40-60 nm in diameter) under an electron microscope.",

The 5 UTR of BVDV, which is sufficiently conserved among the randomly selected BVDV isolates, was chosen for primer design. Primer Explored V4 software was used to design the RT-LAMP primers (http://primerexplorer.jp/e/). The two outer primers are known as the forward outer primer (F3) and the backward outer primer (B3), which helps in strand displacement. The inner primers are known as the forward inner primer (FIP) and the backward inner primer (BIP), respectively. Each inner primer has two distinct sequences corresponding to the sense and antisense sequences of the target, one for priming during the early stage and the other for self-priming during late stage of LAMP. FIP contains F1C (complementary to F1) and F2 sequence. BIP contains the B1C sequence (complementary to B1) and B2 sequence. Both FIP and BIP were high-performance liquid chromatography purified. FIP and BIP contained 3 R(C+G) and 1 Y(A+T) to facilitate the amplification of both BVDV1 and BVDV2 (Table 2 and Fig. 1 ). All primers were synthesized by Invitrogen (GuangZhou, China). The nucleotide sequences and locations of the primers for both Oregon CV24 (GenBank accession no. 0911605.1) and New York 93 (GenBank accession no. AF502399.1) are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1. ",

The second method was to add a fluorescent dye such as SYBR Green I (Solarbio, Beijing, China) or Genefinder TM (Boiv, Xiamen, China) to the samples and to observe the color change under an ultraviolet (UV) hand lamp at a 365 nm wavelength. Samples which were yellow-green were considered positive, while samples which were orange were considered negative. Samples were compared with a negative control to allow for background fluorescence (Rovira et al., 2009; Fan et al., 2010) . Finally, the RT-LAMP products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RT-LAMP reaction generates a combination of DNA fragments of different sizes. The presence of a smear or a pattern of multiple bands of different molecular weights was considered a positive result. A molecular marker was used to estimate the sizes of amplified products.",

            "text": "RT-LAMP has been used in detecting viral RNA molecules due to its simplicity and high sensitivity for a number of viruses including avian influenza virus, classical swine fever virus, West Nile virus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Parida et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2008 Chen et al., , 2010 Rovira et al., 2009) . In this study, an RT-LAMP method was developed for detection of both BVDV1 and BVDV2. The RT-LAMP method exhibited the same sensitivity as real-time RT-PCR and did not detect classical swine fever virus and other bovine viruses. Similarly, an RT-RAMP method for classical swine fever virus did not detect BVDV (Chen et al., 2010) , suggesting the specificity of each RT-LAMP assay. Twenty-one BVDV1 isolates and 17 BVDV2 isolates were selected at random from the GenBank database and the sequence homology in the 5 UTR region upon which the RT-LAMP primers were designed was analyzed. It is estimated that the RT-LAMP would detect 95% of BVDV1 and 70.6% of BVDV2. The lower detection rate for BVDV2 is primarily due to the higher genetic variations observed in the 5 UTR of BVDV2 compared to BVDV1 isolates. All 39 BVDV positive samples confirmed by real-time RT-PCR were clustered within the BVDV1 genotype as revealed by DNA sequence analysis of the 102 bp PCR product (Fig. 3) . The RT-LAMP method will be particularly useful in detecting BVDV from cattle herds in China since BVDV1 is the major type of BVDV circulating in the cattle herds (Li et al., 1983; Xue et al., 2010) . BVDV2 was first isolated from cattle in China in 2010 (Xie et al., 2011) . Due to the inherent genetic heterogeneity of BVDV, it remains to be a challenge to develop a universal molecular test that is capable of detecting all BVDV isolates.",

In contrast, real-time RT-PCR has the same sensitivity as RT-LAMP (4.67 copies of viral RNA). The RT-LAMP failed to detect a true BVDV positive clinical fecal sample, which was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and DNA sequencing. There were 8 fecal samples positive by RT-LAMP and real-time RT-PCR but negative by RT-PCR. It is possible that the 8 fecal samples may have had few viral RNA molecules, which were below the detection limit of RT-PCR analysis. It is interesting to note that the primers for RT-PCR (100-342 nt), real-time RT-PCR (104-205 nt), and RT-RAMP (97-470 nt) described in the study detected the same 5 UTR region of BVDV Oregon CV24 (GenBank accession # AF0911605.1).",
