An antigenic determinant that was highly conserved in both the primary amino acid sequence and secondary structure of all strains was identified between amino acid positions 240 to 255, A synthesized peptide corresponding to this region was found to react with all polyclonal antisera examined from various IBV strains and with one monoclonal antibody (MAb), 9B1B6, out of nine known to react with the S of Gray. The specificity of the interaction with MAb 9B 1 B6 was confirmed by competitive ELISA using bound and unbound peptide. Interestingly, the previously described epitope for 9B 1 B6 had been characterized as cross-reactive with several strains of IBV, as conformation-independent but reacting only with intact whole S, and as associated with the functional integrity of other epitopes, including neutralizing epitopes on the S protein. The apparent critical functional and structural nature of this highly immunogenic determinant suggests a potential contribution in developing protective, cross-reactive subunit vaccines to IBV.",

The potential of IBV for genetic variation undoubtedly plays an important role in the occurence of antigenicatly distinct, virulent viruses that are often responsible for outbreaks of bronchitis in vaccinated flocks. It has also been shown that this remarkable evolution of IBV depends on both point mutations and recombination events and that the latter have commonly involved Mass vaccine-like strains [7, 20, 36, 37] . Although recombination between genes of murine hepatitis viruses had been experimentally produced under laboratory conditions [24, 27, 28] , IBV was the first coronavirus in which recombination has been suggested to generate new naturally occurring strains [20, 25, 36, 37] .",

Antibodies are known to be readily induced to the structural proteins; the spike (S), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) [32] . Whereas antibodies to N are strongly cross-reactive among strains, epitopes on the S and M proteins have been shown to be more variable [32] . The S protein contains determinants that dictate serotype and that induce neutralizing antibody and protection [4, 5, 18, 19, 29, 31] . This protein is synthesized as a large protein that is post-translationally processed to the S 1 and $2 subunits. The primary neutralization epitopes of S are found on the outer globular-like S 1, whereas minor neutralizing epitopes are found on the $2 which anchors the complex into the viral envelope, that is the bilipid membrane [5, 18] . A hypervariable region (HVR) within the S 1 is probably associated with serotype determination of a strain [6, 10, 26, 30] .",

The relative binding avidities, neutralization potentials and competitive interactions of these MAbs, and therefore, their corresponding epitopes, had been well characterized. The interactions of nine of these MAbs with P240 were examined. In a slot blot assay, only the MAb 9B1B6 consistently bound to the peptide (Fig. 5 ). The reaction with 9B1B6 produced a more intense \"Reaction with 100 gg of peptide UAmount of peptide in gg that was added to each well band than the polyclonal anti-Gray antibody. The specific interaction with P240 was confirmed in an ELISA and a dot blot assay (Table 3 ). With the exception of a weak reaction with 5C5B5 in the dot blot assay, the peptide reacted with only 9B1B6 and the polyclonal mouse antibody and the intensity of the observed bands decreased with decreasing concentrations of 9B 1B6. Therefore, the peptide generated to this highly conserved region appeared to correspond to the epitope, or a part of the epitope, that interacted with the MAB 9B 1B6. Consistent with the above results, 9B1B6 had been shown to identify a conformation-independent and group-specific epitope [31] . In order to confirm the specific interaction of P240 with 9B1B6, unbound peptide was used to competitively inhibit the reaction of bound peptide with 9B 1 B6. Varying concentrations of 9B 1B6, maximum or 100% binding was determined in the absence of unbound peptide. The unbound peptide did inhibit the interaction between the MAb and the bound P240, and the inhibition occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6) . The inhibition profile was very similar with the four concentrations of bound peptide shown. Lower concentrations of bound peptide used were below the level of sensitivity of the assay. Therefore, the peptide corresponding to a highly conserved region, consisting mostly of a B-turn common to most, if not all, S 1 proteins, specifically reacted with 9B 1B 16, a MAb that defined a conserved and conformation-independent epitope.",

The apparent continuous evolution of IBV, implicated with emerging virulent strains distinct from vaccine strains, make the generation of relevant protective vaccines difficult. An ideal vaccine for a virus that is as variable as IBV would include highly conserved antigenic determinants that could contribute to the induction of responses that inhibit viral replication or the spread of virus. Antigenic determinants not associated with neutralization of virus could contribute to the control of viral infection; for example, through the induction of cellular immunity. Although epitopes that stimulate IBV neutralizing antibody appear to lie in highly variable regions, the effects of conserved antigenic regions would be universal. Computer generated comparisons of the amino acid sequences of 24 IBV strains, derived from isolations made throughout the world, identified in S 1 four conserved regions separated by three variable regions, the first of which is the HVR. A region of -turns, occupying a prominent position about 100 residues downstream of the HVR (V1) was conserved among all strains examined. This region, also conserved in amino acid sequence, was predicted to be a strongly antigenic region. Interestingly, two residues in this region were also found to be conserved in other coronavirus strains, such as MHV, bovine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus and human coronavirus [35] . At about position 500, a second conserved, highly antigenic determinant of 13 residues was identified in which five amino acids were common in a similar region throughout the coronavirus genus. These apparently functionally critical determinants on the protein could be useful targets for the induction of immunity that might contribute to protection.",

Although, according to the present studies, the epitope was obviously within the S 1 subunit, in western blot assays this MAb had been found to be conformation-independent but only reacted with the whole S and not with either subunit alone [31] . This had suggested that either the epitope lay between the two subunits and was destroyed following post-translational cleavage, or the maintenance of the intact S1 and $2 correlated with the integrity of the epitope. Another unusual property of gB 1 B6 was that it had competitively inhibited the binding of most of the S-specific MAbs, where such broad competition was not common among the other MAbs [31] . The differences in competition could not be related to differences in binding constants of the MAb.

Cleavage in the S could result in alterations in protein conformation that may be biologically important, for example, for viral entry into the host cell. In spite of serologic and pathogenic variations, the receptor-binding epitopes of IBV would be expected to be relatively conserved because most of the IBV strains do infect the respiratory system, as well as cultured chicken embryo kidney cells. In fact, we have identified a tissue receptor for the Gray strain from lung and kidney cells with a single molecular weight (unpubl. obs.), that could be the basis for future studies defining any direct or indirect interactions with the P240 site. Whether or not the corresponding determinant, conserved in both primary and secondary structure, is associated with cell membrane attachment, the eventual definition of the viral function that necessitates its evolutionary conservation should provide valuable insite into the overall structure and the impact of structure on S 1 function.",
