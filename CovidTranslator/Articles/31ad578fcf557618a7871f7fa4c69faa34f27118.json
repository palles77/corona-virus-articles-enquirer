Many viruses exploit the odorant system and enter the CNS via the olfactory bulb (OB). Upon intranasal vesicular stomatitis virus instillation, we show an accumulation of activated microglia and monocytes in the OB. Depletion of microglia during encephalitis results in enhanced virus spread and increased lethality. Activation, proliferation, and accumulation of microglia are regulated by type I IFN receptor signaling of neurons and astrocytes, but not of microglia. Morphological analysis of myeloid cells shows that type I IFN receptor signaling of neurons has a stronger impact on the activation of myeloid cells than of astrocytes. Thus, in the infected CNS, the cross talk among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia is critical for full microglia activation and protection from lethal encephalitis.",

Within the OB, neurons seem to get productively infected, whereas astrocytes are abortively infected (Pfefferkorn et al., 2015) . In vivo infection of microglia with VSV has also been shown in very young mice (Chauhan et al., 2010) ; however, this was not observed in adult mice (Pfefferkorn et al., 2015) . Protective IFN-b is induced locally within the OB, primarily in astrocytes and to a lesser extent in neurons Pfefferkorn et al., 2015) , and the virus is efficiently arrested in a type I interferon receptor (IFNAR)-dependent manner so that the host is protected from lethal encephalitis (Detje et al., 2009) . In addition to the induction of interferon-b (IFN-b), CNS infection via the olfactory route results in recruitment of myeloid cells such as microglia (Getts et al., 2008) , and peripheral immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) (D'Agostino et al., 2012) , T cells, monocytes, and others (Steel et al., 2009 ) into the CNS.",

Thus, this study could not reveal the role of IFNAR signaling of different cell subsets of the CNS in the regulation of myeloid cell responses during viral encephalitis. Few studies revealed the critical role of IFNAR signaling of astrocytes in protection during viral encephalitis (Daniels et al., 2017; Hwang and Bergmann, 2018) ; however, the role of IFNAR signaling of neurons during viral encephalitis has not been addressed at all so far.

Accumulated microglia form an innate immune barrier in peripheral areas of the OB, which plays a key role in restricting VSV spread within the CNS and protects against lethal encephalitis.

Immunolabeling of Iba-1, a common marker for microglia and infiltrating monocytes, revealed that 4 and 6 days post-infection (dpi) increased numbers of Iba-1 + cells were present in the OB ( Figure 1A ). Quantitation of Iba-1 + cells in the glomerular cell layer of the OB, to which olfactory sensory neurons project their axons into, and in the central region called granule cell layer (see Figure S1A for details) (Kalinke et al., 2011) , showed that increased numbers of Iba-1 + cells accumulated in the glomerular layer at 4 and 6 dpi ( Figure 1B ) and significantly more Iba-1 + cells accumulated in the glomerular cell layer compared with the granule cell layer on 6 dpi ( Figure S1B ).",

Such microglia marked mice were infected i.n. with VSV and on 6 dpi light sheet microscopy was performed from the OB (Ert\u20ac urk et al., 2011) . Threedimensional (3D) reconstruction of the OB from non-infected animals showed randomly distributed td-tomato expression, whereas upon VSV infection accumulation of td-tomato expressing microglia was detected in the periphery of the entire OB ( Figure 1H ; Video S1). Thus, immunofluorescence imaging together with flow cytometry and light sheet microscopy revealed that upon i.n.

To address whether accumulating Iba-1 + cells were exclusively microglia or also infiltrating monocytes, immune cells from brains of VSV-infected tamoxifen-treated CX3CR1-cre-ER+/\u00c0 td-tomato St/Wt reporter mice were analyzed by flow cytometry. In these animals also VSV infection led to a significant accumulation of CD45 hi CD11b hi cells in the brain ( Figures 2C and 2D ). It is proposed that during CNS inflammation microglia can upregulate CD45 expression and become indistinguishable from infiltrating monocytes (Greter et al., 2015; Yamasaki et al., 2014) . In order to verify this, expression of the td-tomato reporter was analyzed in the CD45 hi CD11b hi population. Indeed, among CD45 hi CD11b hi cells increased numbers of td-tomato + cells were detected on 6 dpi compared with controls ( Figures 2E and 2G ).

In control animals, most of the cells in the CD45 low CD11b low population expressed Tmem119, whereas basically no cells in the CD45 hi CD11b hi population expressed Tmem119 ( Figure 2F ; Figure S2B ). However, upon VSV infection, there was a significant increase in the Tmem119 + CD206 \u00c0 cells within the CD45 hi CD11b hi population ( Figures 2F and 2G ), confirming the presence of microglia in the CD45 hi CD11b hi population from infected animals. A significant increase in td-tomato \u00c0 Ly6C + events also confirmed infiltration of peripheral monocytes in the CNS (Figures 2E and 2G; Figures S2C and S2D) . Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling experiments in these mice revealed that CD45 low CD11b low cells did not show significant BrdU incorporation, whereas CD45 hi CD11b hi cells showed significantly increased percentages of BrdU-positive cells in infected animals (Figures 2H and 2I) . Together, these data show that upon i.n. VSV infection proliferating microglia and infiltrating monocytes accounted for the accumulation of myeloid cells within the CNS.

            "text": "Detailed expression analysis of myeloid cell-associated genes showed that transcripts for several microglia-specific genes such as Tmem119, Sall1, P2ry12, Hexb, Fcrls, Siglech, and Cx3cr1 (Bennett et al., 2016; Butovsky et al., 2014; Buttgereit et al., 2016) were enriched in the CD45 low CD11b low population from control animals but absent in the monocyte population ( Figure 3E ; Figure S3 ), confirming the identity of microglia. Interestingly, compared to CD45 low CD11b low microglia from control animals, CD45 low CD11b low microglia as well as CD45 hi CD11b hi td-tomato + microglia from infected animals showed downregulation of all of these genes (Figure 3E; Figure S3 ). Infiltrating monocytes showed enhanced numbers of Ccr2 transcripts compared to microglia. Additionally, these cells also showed higher expression of Nos2 and Cd86 transcripts ( Figure 3E ; Figure S3 ). Interestingly, microglia and monocytes from infected animals showed expression of the Mki67 gene, which is associated with proliferation ( Figure 3E ). Together, these fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and RNA-seq studies confirm the presence of CD45 hi microglia in the OB upon VSV infection and show that they are distinct from CD45 low microglia in terms of their gene expression during CNS infection. Accumulation of Microglia in the OB Is Essential for the Inhibition of Virus Spread Previously, it was shown that oral treatment of mice with the brain-penetrant CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945 resulted in depletion of microglia (Pyonteck et al., 2013) . We used this method to deplete microglia and addressed whether the accumulation of microglia was essential to arrest VSV spread via the olfactory route. BLZ945 treatment reduced the numbers of microglia in control animals as well as in VSV-infected animals as seen by immunohistology ( Figures  4A and 4B ). Depletion of microglia was also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of CNS immune cells from control animals, which showed a significant decrease in the number of CD45 low CD11b low cells in BLZ945 treated animals compared to controls (Figures 4D and 4E ). Flow cytometry analysis of CNS immune cells from VSV-infected animals showed a significant decrease in the number of CD45 low CD11b low cells, but not in CD45 hi CD11b hi cells ( Figures 4D and 4E) . These data show that decreased accumulation of Iba-1 + cells observed in immunohistology ( Figures 4A and 4B ) was due to depletion of microglia, and not due to the lack of infiltration of blood monocytes. Along with the major decrease in the number of microglia, we also observed a minute, but statistically significant, decrease in CD45 hi CD11b hi cells, suggesting depletion of some perivascular and meningeal macrophages ( Figures 4D and 4E ). Staining of CD11b and CSF-1R in blood cells ( Figure 4C ) and the presence of CD45 hi CD11b hi cells in the CNS upon VSV infection (Figures 4D and 4E) showed that BLZ945 did not deplete blood monocytes or inhibit their accumulation in the CNS. CD86, CD206, and Ly6C expression of myeloid cells was comparable between vehicle-or BLZ945-treated animals, suggesting that BLZ945 treatment did not inhibit activation of myeloid cells ( Figures  S4A and S4B) .",

These data indicated a diminished restriction of virus spread from the OB to other brain regions upon microglia depletion.

Analysis of Iba-1 + cells in the OB of such uninfected mice showed a normal distribution of Iba-1 + cells with long thin processes similar to WT control animals ( Figure 5A ; see Figure 1 ). Upon VSV infection, CX3CR1-cre-ER+/\u00c0 IFNAR fl/fl mice showed increased numbers of Iba-1 + cells comparable with WT animals on 6 dpi. In contrast, in infected Nes-cre +/\u00c0 IFNAR fl/fl mice, accumulation of Iba-1 + cells was impaired at 4 and 6 dpi (Fig, 5A-C) . However, Iba-1 + cells did express Mac-3, which confirmed their activation ( Figure 5A ). Next, we analyzed the role of IFNAR signaling of astrocytes by using GFAP-cre +/\u00c0 IFNAR fl/fl mice. The astrocyte-specific cre expression in these mice was confirmed by the analysis of GFAP-cre +/\u00c0 Rosa26eYFP St/Wt reporter offspring, which showed YFP expression in astrocytes, but not in neurons ( Figure S5 ). In GFAP-cre +/\u00c0 IFNAR fl/fl animals, VSV infection led to enhanced expression of Mac-3 on Iba-1 + cells, but accumulation of Iba-1 + cells was impaired at 4 and 6 dpi ( Figures 5A-5C) . Similarly, Syn1-cre +/\u00c0 IFNAR fl/fl animals lacking IFNAR signaling on neurons also showed many Iba-1 + cells that stained positive for Mac-3 ( Figure 5A ), but accumulation of Iba-1 + cells was also impaired upon VSV infection ( Figures 5A  and 5C ).",

However, the lengths of individual processes was decreased ( Figures 6A and 6B) , confirming activation of myeloid cells upon VSV infection. In accordance with the immunofluorescence data, myeloid cells from animals lacking IFNAR signaling on neurons or astrocytes showed a significantly diminished increase in the number of primary processes, and the length of the processes was also not significantly altered ( Figures  6A and 6B) , which suggested a lack of activation.

These data suggest an essential role of IFNAR signaling of neurons and astrocytes, but not of microglia, for the induction of microglia proliferation and accumulation in the OB of VSV-infected mice. Unlike WT mice, i.n. VSV-challenged mice lacking IFNAR signaling selectively in neurons or astrocytes showed presence of virus in different CNS regions at 4 dpi ( Figure S7 ) and succumbed to VSV infection with similar kinetics as Nes-cre +/\u00c0 IFNAR fl/fl mice (Detje et al., 2009) (Figure 7A ). These mice showed high viral titers in all parts of the brain, but not in the peripheral organs tested (Figures 7B-7G ). Mice lacking IFNAR signaling of microglia survived the infection and had no detectable virus in any tissue tested, similar to WT animals ( Figures 7A-7G) . IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice died on 3 dpi with high virus loads in all tissues tested ( Figures 7A-7G) .

            "text": "Little is known about the mechanisms that regulate myeloid cell activation and accumulation in the CNS during virus infection. Here, we found that upon i.n. VSV instillation activated myeloid cells, especially microglia, accumulated in the glomerular layer of the OB. Depletion of microglia during infection led to enhanced virus spread in the CNS and caused lethal encephalitis. This suggests that upon CNS virus infection microglia form an innate barrier in the OB that controls virus spread via the olfactory route. IFNAR signaling of neurons and astrocytes, but not of microglia, regulated the activation of myeloid cells, and IFNAR signaling of neurons had a stronger impact on activation than IFNAR signaling of astrocytes. This was also reflected by the number of accumulated myeloid cells in the OB, local proliferation of activated myeloid cells, and protection against virus spread into the CNS and subsequent lethal disease. Thus, our results highlight the relevance of cross talk among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia for the regulation of microglia activation and its protective role during CNS virus infection.",

On 6 dpi, there was significant accumulation of activated proliferating microglia and infiltrating monocytes in the glomerular region of the OB as detected by immunohistology and verified by flow cytometry of genetically microglia marked mice. Light sheet microscopy of whole intact OB of microglia marked mice showed that, upon i.n. VSV infection, microglia accumulated in the glomerular region of the whole OB. These 3D data were supported by immunohistology data that also showed accumulation of Iba-1 + cells in the glomerular region of the OB. It was previously shown that VSV is arrested in the glomerular region of the OB (Detje et al., 2009) . A similar observation was made in the VSV infection model for brain DC, in which CD11c-YFP mice were used to study the dynamics of DC in the OB after VSV infection. In that study, also accumulation of Iba-1 + CD11c + cells was detected, which the authors defined as DC (D'Agostino et al., 2012) . However, it is possible that a part of these CD11c + cells in fact were microglia, as recently it has been shown that microglia also express CD11c during neuroinflammation (Greter et al., 2015) . In our study also the accumulation of Iba-1 + cells was detected at 4 dpi and continued at 6 dpi. Together, these data suggest that the OB is the site of immune response during pathogen entry via the olfactory route.",

Using genetically microglia marked mice, we found that upon CNS virus infection some microglia shifted to the CD45 hi population, which we also confirmed by Tmem119 expression analysis and flow cytometry. Since microglia have been implemented to play a detrimental role in the long-term complications of encephalitis (Vasek et al., 2016) , observation of two distinct microglia populations (CD45 low and CD45 hi ) and infiltrating monocytes motivated us to characterize these cells in greater detail. Analysis of gene expression via RNAseq of sorted myeloid cells from the OB showed that both microglia and monocytes had distinct gene expression profiles.",

Although both microglia and monocytes showed IFNAR stimulation as indicated by abundant induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are expressed upon IFNAR stimulation and have many antiviral functions, and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, there were still significant differences in gene expression profiles of the different subpopulations. Microglia from uninfected animals showed high expression of many microglia-specific genes. While microglia-specific function of Tmem119 is not known yet, Sall1 has been identified as a negative regulator of microglia activation (Buttgereit et al., 2016) .

            "text": "We hypothesized that accumulation of microglia in the glomerular region of the OB was an innate immune defense mechanism that restricted virus spread via the olfactory route. In order to experimentally address this, we depleted microglia using a pharmacological method (Pyonteck et al., 2013) in animals i.n. instilled with VSV. This allowed depletion of microglia with high efficiency, although there was also a very minor depletion of PVMs. However, the number of blood monocytes and the accumulation of CD45 hi CD11b hi cells in the CNS upon VSV infection did not differ between vehicle-and BLZ945-treated animals. For microglial maintenance, IL-34 is required and it acts as the ligand for CSF-1R, whereas CSF-1 is the ligand for monocyte development (Greter et al., 2012) . Thus, specific microglia depletion could be achieved by BLZ945 inhibiting the interaction of CSF-1R with IL-34, but not with CSF-1. Increased spread and presence of virus in the brain after microglia depletion suggest that accumulated microglia in the OB provide an innate immune shield against virus entry via the olfactory route. Theoretically, it could also be possible that the enhanced virus spread in the CNS was due to the small decrease in the number of PVMs, and not due to the large decrease in the number microglia in the CNS parenchyma. However, since on 7 dpi there is no difference in the viral titers in the OB of vehicle-or BLZ945treated animals, it is very likely that after i.n. infection not the viral entry into the CNS, but the spread of the virus in the CNS was enhanced. Similar observations were also made in other studies where depletion of microglia led to enhanced virus and lethality after coronavirus and flavivirus infections (Seitz et al., 2018; Wheeler et al., 2018) . Notably, in the study by Wheeler et al., there was depletion of PVMs. However, in our as well as their study, the decrease in the numbers of PVM is very minor compared with the decrease in the number of microglia. Since the spread of the virus within the CNS is enhanced and not the entry in the CNS, it can be concluded that microglia are responsible for inhibition of virus spread within the CNS. Peripheral organs of these animals did not show detectable virus, indicating that inhibition of CSF-1R did not induce general immune suppression. Thus, our data show a direct antiviral role of microglia after viral entry via the i.n. route.",

However, the role of different CNS cell types in regulating myeloid cell activation during viral encephalitis has not been addressed in depth. Therefore, we focused on investigating this aspect in our model of VSV encephalitis after i.n. infection. Lack of Iba-1 + cell proliferation, accumulation, and activation-associated cellular morphology in animals lacking IFNAR signaling of neurons or astrocytes, but not microglia, suggest a model in which the IFN-b produced within the OB acts on neurons and astrocytes and type I IFN stimulation-induced changes in neurons and astrocytes regulate microglia functions and phenotype. This is in contrast to the study by Nayak et al., in which it was proposed that IFNAR signaling of myeloid cells was essential for their full activation and dynamics of accumulation. One of the possible reasons for the lack of microglial activation and accumulation in mice with a selective IFNAR deletion on astrocytes or neurons could be high viral titers in the CNS. Nevertheless, we would like to point out that, in all of the animals, virus is present in the OB and therefore microglia from WT animals are also exposed to high amounts of virus at least early after infection. Thus, the lack of microglia activation seen in the animals lacking IFNAR signaling of neurons and astrocytes is due to abrogated neuron-astrocyte-microglia communication.",

This was followed by washing 3 times with PBS. Slices were mounted in mowiol containing DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to counter stain nucleus. Pictures were taken on a BX61 microscope (Olympus). Original pictures were adjusted for brightness, contrast and color balance and post processed using ImageJ software (NIH). Cell counting was done using cell counter Plugin of ImageJ (Video S2). The exact procedure to use the Plugin is also given at the link: https://imagej.nih. gov/ij/plugins/cell-counter.html. The Plugin can also be downloaded using this link. Quantification of glial cells was performed for proliferating myeloid cells (double staining with Iba-1/Ki-67) and the total myeloid cell numbers (Iba-1 + ). Immunopositive cells with identified nucleus (counterstaining with 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for immunofluorescence) were counted and expressed as number of cells per mm 2 area.",

Tissue disruption was done in C tubes using gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) using program for brain. This was followed by digestion for 30 minutes. After digestion, enzymes were removed by PBS wash and pelleting of digested tissues by centrifugation. Percoll solutions of different densities were prepared in PBS using percoll. 4 mL 70% Percoll solution was added to the pellet and homogenization was done using needle and syringe to remove any clumps.

Reads were aligned to the GRCm38 mouse genome assembly using STAR aligner and the number of reads mapping to each gene were counted using HTSeq-count (Anders et al., 2015) . Filtering of the data included the exclusion of genes which did not present at least 10 counts in all the replicates. Normalization and differential analysis were performed using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) and genes that did not achieve 10 counts in all three replicates were filtered out. Pairwise comparison between the different conditions and populations was performed for each time point. Differential gene expression analysis were based on the negative binomial distribution and subsequent Wald statistical test (Love et al., 2014) and genes with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 were considered to show significant differential gene expression. To asses overall similarities between samples the principle component analysis (PCA) was performed. The top differentially regulated genes depicted in the heatmap were subjected to rlog normalization and clustered using k means. Genes with a FDR < 0.05 and a minimum of two-fold change were shown in the Venn diagrams generated by using the Bioconductor package VennDiagram.",

All mice used in this study are on the C57BL/6 background. In order to enable selective depletion of IFNAR on CNS cell subsets, IFNAR fl/fl mice (Kamphuis et al., 2006) were bread with Nes-cre +/\u00c0 (Tronche et al., 1999) , Syn1-cre +/\u00c0 (Zhu et al., 2001) , GFAP-cre +/\u00c0 (Bajenaru et al., 2002) , or CX3CR1-cre-ER+/\u00c0 (Goldmann et al., 2013) mice. The absence of germline deletions for IFNAR fl/fl were verified by PCR analysis. Rosa26eYFP St/St mice (Srinivas et al., 2001) were bred with GFAP-cre +/\u00c0 mice to assess the specificity of cre. In order to generate microglia specific td-tomato reporter animals, CX3CR1-cre-ER+/\u00c0 mice were bread with td-tomato St/St mice (Madisen et al., 2010) . IFNAR-deficient mice (IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 ) (M\u20ac uller et al., 1994) were more than 20-fold backcrossed to the C57BL/6 background. Both male and female adult mice older than 8 weeks were included in experiments. Littermates were randomly assigned to experimental groups. In order to induce cre ER activity, animals were treated subcutaneously with 4 mg of tamoxifen (Sigma) two times with 48 h interval in between after weaning. In order to eliminate monocyte targeting, experiments were performed 8 weeks after tamoxifen treatment. In order to mark proliferating cells, animals were given 200 ml BrdU (Invitrogen) i.p. 12 hr and 3 hr before sacrifice. Animals were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions, with ad libitum food and water, in the central mouse facility of the TWINCORE and at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research. Animal experiments were conducted in compliance with German federal and state legislation on animal experiments.",
