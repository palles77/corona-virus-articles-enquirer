However, the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China. Conclusion: Our study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia. These strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the COVID-19 epidemic. : medRxiv preprint the diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China.

According to our analyses, the growth speed generally increased first and decreased to zero quickly after reaching the Speedmax point. The area under the curve (AUC) of the derivative function represents the cumulative number of confirmed cases. Thus, per region, a shorter time to Speedmax generally indicates a smaller AUC, representing fewer cumulative confirmed cases when reaching the plateau. Therefore, to some extent, the time to Speedmax demonstrates the effectiveness of strategies on inhibiting the spread of virus. Notably, since the plateau number is affected by multiple factors, it is inappropriate to conclude that one area with shorter Speedmax means fewer plateau number than another area with longer Speedmax. The Speedmax is useful for assessing changes of the plateau number itself.",

Areas were divided into three parts: areas adjoined to Hubei (Figure 1), northern areas (Figure 2), and southern areas (Figure 3) of China. Because of an adjustment to confirmation criteria, the number of confirmed patients in Wuhan surged on February 22, 2020. Similarly, 200 new confirmed patients surged in Shandong on February 19, 2020 due to an outbreak of COVID-19 in a prison. However, the growth speed had basically reached zero since February 17, 2020 in Shandong. To eliminate the influence of this specific incident and perform model fitting, we fit the model for Shandong with adjusted data.",

Because little information was acquired at the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19, it is understandable that Wuhan needed a longer time to reach the Speedmax point.The detailed data for the time to Speedmax and emigration index was shown inSupplementary Table 1.",
