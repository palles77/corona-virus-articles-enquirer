With more patient enrollment in the future, the conclusion of different or not different could be ensured. Notably, why did LPV/r and arbidol fail to benefit for those patients? The reason remains unclear. We speculate one reason is that LPV/r and arbidol may need dose increase to successfully suppress SARS-CoV-2 in human body according to the cytotoxicity test in vitro [8, 13, 14] , however, the dose increase is difficult to achieve clinically for the side effects of these drugs. In particular, it should be noted that patients treated with LPV/r had more gastrointestinal symptoms without achieving the definitely antiviral effect, which might affect the patient's recovery. The results in our study are consistent with findings from a recent clinical trial of LPV/r in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19 conducted in Wuhan, which recruited 199 hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 and concluded that no benefit was observed with LPV/r treatment beyond standard care [20] .

Second, the study did not enroll severely or critically ill patients, or patients with many comorbidities who are at increased risk of poor outcome and was conducted in only one center. Third, the study was not completely blinded, so it is possible to influence the outcome. We will continue to follow these patients to evaluate their long-term prognosis. Therefore, the findings of this study require further verification and evaluation. Nevertheless, as a prospective randomized, controlled trial, this study could still provide meaningful suggestions for proper application of LPV/r and arbidol in the treatment of COVID-19.",
