In this study, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was inserted into the human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) antigenome and a recombinant, infectious virus was rescued. Maximum EGFP expression levels, measured by fluorescence, were seen at day 3. Comparison of a three-day, viral expressed EGFP fluorescence assay to a seven-day, neutral red assay, based on complete cell destruction in virus infected MA-104 cells, yielded Z\u2032-factor values of 0.83 and 0.70, respectively. A three-day, endpoint EGFP-based antiviral assay and a seven-day, endpoint neutral red based antiviral assay were run in parallel to establish antiviral sensitivity profiles of 23 compounds based on selective index (SI) values. Using an SI threshold of 10, the EGFP-based antiviral assay had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 54%. Thus, the use of an EGFP-based antiviral assay for testing potential antiviral compounds against HPIV-3 in a high-throughput format may be justified.",

            "text": "The discovery of new antiviral drugs usually requires successful testing in vitro prior to further development. To measure the efficacy of these drugs, cell-based antiviral assays involving colorimetric and luminescence detection systems have been used. Colorimetric assays often measure absorption of neutral red or 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), which are taken up by intact cell cells as indicators of cell health. Neutral red measures membrane integrity by being absorbed by lysosomes, while MTT, once inside the cell, is reduced from a yellow tetrazolium salt into water-insoluble purple formazan crystals by a mitochondrial reductase (Barnard et al., 2004; Finter, 1969; Watanabe et al., 1994) . The time consuming and labor intensive nature of these methods have proven to be drawbacks (Smee et al., 2002) . An alternative type of detection method is the CellTiter-Glo \u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI), which measures the ATP generated by intact cells (Noah et al., 2007) . This assay claims to be more sensitive, less time consuming, and less labor intensive. Even though the luminescence assay may solve the disadvantages of the colorimetric assays, several issues arise that are also common to colorimetric assays as well.",

            "text": "A major problem with most cell viability assays is that they are designed to detect any cell death and do not differentiate between drug toxicity and viral cytopathic effect (CPE). By conducting a parallel drug toxicity assay, the two factors can be mathematically separated, although it is assumed that the differences measured in the assay are due to drug toxicity and CPE independently. This assumption ignores the possibility of positive or negative compounding effects from potential interactions between the drug and virus. A second problem is the inability for some viruses to produce detectable amounts of CPE and/or the long incubation times needed to reach complete cell monolayer destruction, which is often required to get accuracy in dye uptake assays. For the colorimetric and luminescent antiviral assay to be effective and reliable; complete cell destruction is necessary to obtain significant signal-tobackground ratios. Viral incubation times may extend up to 14 days for some viruses, which is problematic because the cell control may not survive that long. A third problem is the detection of syncytia that initially do not cause cell destruction. Early syncytia formation is problematic because, even though viral CPE can be visualized within a few days, syncytia absorb similar amounts of neutral red or MTT compared to uninfected cells (Smee et al., 2002) . Therefore, it is necessary for the complete destruction of the syncytia before dye uptake assays will differentiate between uninfected cells and cells impacted by syncytial formation. Therefore, a detection system that can directly measure a change in CPE independent of drug toxicity in a shorter amount of time would be preferable.",

            "text": "One strategy of enhancing sensitivity and decreasing the incubation times of an assay would be to construct a recombinant virus that expresses a reporter gene. For example, a gene for a fluorescent protein could be cloned directly into a viral genome that would be expressed in proportion to virus replication and allow direct CPE measurement independently from drug toxicity. This has been done for antiviral compound screening purposes by inserting the gene for the green fluorescent protein into the genomes of the ebolavirus and cytomegalovirus (Marschall et al., 2000; Towner et al., 2005) . Thus, for syncytial forming viruses, such as human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3), a similar approach would be very useful in reducing the time needed to complete an antiviral assay.",

One such virus, strain JS, was used to follow an infection of the recombinant virus in lung epithelium (Zhang et al., 2005) . The second virus, strain 47885, was used to screen a library of potential antiviral compounds, yet specific details on replication differences of the recombinant virus, expressing the fluorescent protein, compared to the wild-type strain were not discussed (Mao et al., 2008) . In this paper, a recombinant HPIV-3 virus (rHPIV3-EGFP) expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was rescued and evaluated for its use in antiviral assays by comparing it side-by-side with both the HPIV-3 wild-type (HPIV-3 WT) and the recombinant HPIV-3 (rHPIV3) strains. Slight differences in virulence between the rHPIV3-EGFP virus and the HPIV-3 WT virus in cell culture may validate the possibility of substituting the rHPIV3-EGFP for the HPIV-3 WT virus in primary, high-throughput antiviral assays.",

            "text": "A DrdI restriction site was found between the N gene's start signal and start codon of the HPIV-3 WT genome that was used to facilitate the insertion of the EGFP gene. Therefore, both the forward and reverse primers that were used to amplify the EGFP open reading frame were designed to contain a DrdI restriction site on their 5\u2032 ends. The HPIV-3 WT gene end, intercistronic, and gene start signals were also encoded onto the reverse primer so that the inserted EGFP gene would be recognized as an additional HPIV-3 WT gene (Fig. 1A) . The \"Rule of Six\" was followed to generate an 852 bp EGFP gene segment. The rule suggests that viral replication is most efficient when the viral genome length is a factor of six, which is most likely due to a single nucleocapsid protein binding to six genomic ribonucleotides (Calain and Roux, 1993; Durbin et al., 1997) . In constructing the recombinant HPIV-3 expressing EGFP, the presence of three G ribonucleotides, which are equally separated by 5 ribonucleotides starting 79 ribonucleotides from the 5\u2032 end of the antigenome, had to be manipulated. This location represents one complete turn of the 3-dimensional helical structure of the nucleocapsid encased RNA genome and is thought to co-regulate viral replication perhaps through the assembly and binding of the viral polymerase-phosphoprotein complex with the nucleocapsids (Tapparel et al., 1998) . The EGFP forward primer interrupted this natural pattern but the problem was solved by adding the three G residues in the forward primer at positions 11, 17, and 23. Before the addition of the EGFP gene segment into the antigenome, the 1-5267 cDNA segment was cloned into the pACYC177 plasmid to circumvent multiple DrdI restriction sites located in the pUC19 plasmid. The resulting 1-6119 cDNA segment, now encoding the gene for EGFP, was then cloned into the pUC19 plasmid, already containing the 5249-11366 cDNA segment. Finally, the addition of the 11284-15453 cDNA segment to the construct resulted in a complete, infectious, recombinant HPIV-3 virus, expressing the EGFP gene.",

RNA isolated from rHPIV3-EGFP, rHPIV3, and HPIV-3 WT infections was amplified by RT-PCR. The sequences generated from the 5\u2032 RACE RT-PCR, containing the DraIII restriction site, confirmed the Ato-C and T-to-G mutations. These two mutations created a unique DraIII restriction site present only in the recombinant viruses and allowed for the insertion of the final 11284-15453 cDNA segment and completion of the recombinant viruses. The third genetic marker was also confirmed by aligning sequences generated from the 5\u2032 end of the L gene from all three viruses. The A-to-G mutation eliminated one of two natural SphI restriction sites located in L gene portion of the HPIV-3 WT virus. The second SphI restriction site was used to insert both the 5249-11366 and 11284-15453 cDNA segments. These PCR products were also digested with SphI and separated on an agarose gel to show that HPIV-3 WT was digested in the presence of SphI, while the two recombinant viruses were not (Fig. 1C) .",

The infectious virus titer for rHPIV3 was not significantly different compared to HPIV-3 WT (p>0.01) whereas, rHPIV3-EGFP was significantly lower compared to both HPIV-3 WT and rHPIV3 (p<0.01). The addition of the EGFP gene into the HPIV-3 genome appeared to attenuate rHPIV3-EGFP compared to either the WT or recombinant strains. However, the process of creating and rescuing the recombinant virus and/or the presence of the three genetic markers did not cause attenuation of rHPIV3 because no significant reduction in virus titer was seen. For all subsequent experiments the volume of virus inoculums were adjusted so that equal PFUs were added. In addition, the replication kinetics of the three viruses, HPIV-3 WT, rHIPV3 and rHPIV-EGFP were measured to confirm the attenuation of rHPIV3-EGFP compared to the wild-type and recombinant viruses. The growth curves for rHPIV3 and HPIV-3 WT were very similar, with no significant differences (p>0.01) (Fig. 3A) . However, the growth curve for rHPIV3-EGFP was significantly delayed compared to the growth curves for both HPIV-3 WT and rHPIV3 (p<0.01). During the initial stages of infection, the attenuated growth of rHPIV3-EGFP compared to both the wild-type and recombinant viruses can be seen, yet it appears that the replication of the rHPIV3-EGFP virus may recover and amplify itself to similar levels compared to the other two viruses during the later stages of replication. This result confirmed that the addition of an additional gene into the HPIV-3 genome may be the cause of attenuation.",

An oligo(dT)20 primer was used to prime the RT reaction for the L gene transcription measurement, binding only viral mRNA and not viral genomic RNA. Relative expression differences were calculated and normalized, using the 0 hour for each virus as the calibrator, according to the calculations developed by Pfaffl (2001) . A calibrator was used to normalize the amount of mRNA transcripts or genomic copies generated during the infections with the amount that was added at the time of infection for each virus. L gene transcription (Fig. 3C ) and genomic replication (Fig. 3D) were significantly reduced in an rHPIV3-EGFP infection compared to the HPIV-3 WT infection (p<0.01).

            "text": "To investigate the practicality of using rHPIV3-EGFP in an antiviral screening assay, a panel of 23 antiviral compounds were selected that had shown antiviral activity against HPIV-3 in past screens (data not shown). A standard seven-day, NR-based assay and a three-day, EGFPbased assay, using the same virus stock, were done in parallel using 23 compounds, which included 22 nucleoside analogs and the one fusion protein, DAS181 (Table 2) . A selective index (SI) value \u22643 was considered not active, SI values between 4 and 9 slightly active, between 10 and 49 moderately active, and \u226550 highly active. Compounds with SI values \u226510 dictated if an antiviral drug would be further evaluated in additional assays. Using the threshold SI value of 10, the three-day, EGFP-based assay had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 54%, compared to the seven-day NR assay. Using the seven-day NR assay as the gold standard, six compounds were falsely identified as selective inhibitors of virus replication using the rHPIV3-EGFP virus in the antiviral assay, which led to the 54% specificity. These six compounds showed an increase in the SI value over the threshold of 10 in the EGFP assay but under the threshold in the NR assay. Of these six, PSI-5449 was not active in the NR assay but was moderately active in the EGFP assay. An additional four, ribamidine, selenazofurin, PSI-5852, and PSI-5095, were considered slightly active in the NR assay and moderately active in the EGFP assay. The remaining compound, CS-1196 was considered slightly active in the NR assay and highly active in the EGFP assay. A factor that contributed to the differences in selectivity detected in each assay was the lack of toxicity found in cells exposed to compound in the EGFP assay. The toxicity of a drug is determined by the concentration at which it is lethally toxic to 50% of the cells present in the assay, termed IC 50 . No toxicity was observed for all 6 compounds falsely identified as selective inhibitors in the EGFP assay and the IC 50 values for four out of the six compounds were significantly decreased in the seven-day NR assay (p<0.05). The difference in toxicity was probably due to the accumulation of toxicity during the seven-day incubation period of the NR assay. On the other hand, when the rHPIV3-EGFP virus was measured by the EGFP fluorescent assay the resulting EC 50 values were significantly lower (p<0.05) for three out of the six drugs compared to the NR assay. This result will also contribute to the higher selectivity detected for these compounds in the EGFP assay compared to the selectivity of these compounds evaluated in the NR assay. The combination of an increased IC 50 and a decreased EC 50 undoubtedly increased the SI for these six compounds and falsely suggested further evaluation, explaining the low specificity of the EGFP assay. Overall, for most other compounds a trend is seen when an increase in the SI value was detected in the EGFP fluorescent assay compared to the NR assay. In most cases, the increased SI can be contributed to either a significant decrease in the EC 50 , significant increase in the IC 50 , or a combination of both scenarios.",

            "text": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of substituting rHPIV3-EGFP for HPIV-3 WT in the initial screening of potential antiviral compounds. First, attenuation of either the rHPIV3 or rHPIV3-EGFP, compared to HPIV-3 WT, was studied to determine if loss of virulence had occurred due to either the assembly and rescue of a recombinant clone or the addition of the EGFP gene. The rescued rHPIV3 virus has three genetic mutations that made it distinguishable from HPIV-3 WT. Although these three genetic markers were detected in the rescued virus, they did not attenuate the recombinant virus. Two of these markers reside in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the HPIV-3 antigenome and could have disrupted regulatory promoters to attenuated rHPIV3; they did not. On the other hand, the addition of the EGFP gene into the rHPIV3 virus, which increased the length of the viral genome by only 5% and added a seventh, distinctive gene unit, did significantly attenuate the rescued rHPIV3-EGFP virus. Even though, the attenuation was statistically significant, only a 1.5-fold reduction in rHPIV3-EGFP titers was seen. This may be of no significance because a wild-type virus grown in varying cell culture conditions: higher or lower passaged cells, confluent or less than confluent cells, variation in the media formulations, or incubation in varying conditions, may inhibit or accelerate virus replication. A 10-fold, or greater, reduction in virus titer would indicate severe attenuation and would suggest that the new virus was indeed biologically different than the wild-type strain. In support of this point, the CPE produced by rHPIV3-EGFP was not significantly inhibited or accelerated compared to the CPE produced by HPIV-3 WT throughout the duration of a viral infection. Although, decreased viral titers and slower viral replication was detected for the rHPIV3-EGFP virus, CPE produced by each virus remained the same.",

            "text": "The attenuation of rHPIV3-EGFP can be attributed to the combination of the small increase in genome length and the addition of a foreign gene, which contributed to the significantly reduced viral genomic replication and mRNA transcription. The viral polymerase terminates and reinitiates transcription at each gene junction inconsistently, resulting in a reduction of downstream gene transcription and expression in a gradient fashion (Cattaneo et al., 1987; Homann et al., 1990) . Thus, the first of six viral genes, NP, should be expressed at significantly higher levels compared to the last L gene. Therefore, the insertion of the EGFP gene into the first viral gene position should result in a reduction in mRNA transcription in all downstream viral genes due to further inconsistent termination and reinitiation of the viral polymerase. This phenomenon was confirmed when transcription of the L gene was reduced in the rHPIV3-EGFP virus infection compared to the HPIV-3 WT virus infection. In addition, genomic replication was also reduced, perhaps due to the overall decline in the expression of necessary viral replication proteins. A significant reduction in viral transcription could also lead to a reduction in translation of the viral transcripts. Overall, less viral proteins would be available for replication purposes resulting in less efficient viral replication. Thus, less virions would be assembled because of the reduction in viral proteins and genomic RNA strands resulting in an attenuated virus. Furthermore, ribavirin and 2-thio-6-azauridine inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase, respectively, and can be classified as nucleoside analogs, which may be incorporated into the viral RNA strands and interfere with further protein translation and genome replication (De Clercq, 1993; Sidwell, 1996) . The reduced EC 50 values are probably related to the reduction in mRNA transcription and genomic replication; therefore, less compound is needed to incorporate into the RNA strands and inhibit viral expression. On the other hand, DAS181 eliminates the host cell receptor needed for viral entry and inhibits virion binding and absorption (Malakhov et al., 2006) . The reduced EC 50 values are most likely due to the reduction in viable virions produced by the attenuated virus; therefore, less compound is required to prevent virion attachment. The consequence of a slightly attenuated virus is the possibility of a reduced EC 50 value, which may increase the SI value above the threshold of 10 and result in a false positive, meaning that the same compound may not inhibit the wild type virus as much. This consequence is acceptable in the initial screening of a high-throughput assay because the false positive compounds would be retested in the presence of the wild-type virus and if they were true, false positives, they would be eliminated in the second round of screening.",

Assays that use dyes or enzymes, like NR, Vybrant \u00ae MTT, and CellTiter-Glo \u00ae Luminescent, are only measuring the health of a cell and for these assays to be most accurate the maximum difference between signal and background needs to be achieved. This occurs for these types of assays when the virus has completely lysed the infected cell monolayer or when cell membranes have become non-functional. The length of time needed to reach this point depends upon the virus. The virus used in this study, HPIV-3, requires seven days to achieve complete cell destruction at the MOI used. However, using an assay that measures a viral expressed reporter gene, the incubation time is only limited to when the reporter gene reaches maximal or acceptable signalto-background ratio levels. For rHPIV3-EGFP, EGFP expression is detectable 24 hours postinfection and reaches its peak at three days in a dose responsive manner. The characteristic syncytia formation of the HPIV-3 virus might be the reason that abundant EGFP expression levels are achieved and remain for five days after the maximum expression levels are reached. Even the lowest dose of virus shown could potentially be used in the antiviral assay, but for the purpose of this study we chose to use a concentration of virus that was equivalent to the concentration of virus used in typical antiviral assays. The broad range of EGFP detection possibilities, in both the length of time and concentration of virus, could potentially be used in experiments that need more defined parameters.",

It had a good to excellent Z\u2032-factor value in addition to very high signal-to-background and signal-to-noise ratios. The Z\u2032-factor takes into account the variability of both the signal and background and the difference between the signal and background. Thus, the virus-expressed EGFP gene is very suitable for this type of assay because only the infected cells will fluoresce and any background measurement seen is due to autofluorescence of the plate, medium, or cells, which can be subtracted from the signal. On the other hand the NR, Vybrant \u00ae MTT, and CellTiter-Glo \u00ae luminescent assays all measure any intact cells infected or not infected with virus. This can be problematic if the virus does not lyse the cell monolayer completely because the background measurements are raised, reducing the sensitivity and validity of the assay. For example, the CellTiter-Glo \u00ae luminescent assay was very susceptible to this phenomenon because even when the cells of the virus controls were completely lysed, as determined visually, significant luminescence was measured when compared to the no-cell control (data not shown), thus the poor signal-to-background and signal-to-noise ratios for the luminescent assay.",

However, this is of no concern because in the second round of antiviral drug testing, HPIV-3 WT virus would be used with results being measured by the NR uptake assay. In addition, active compounds could also be further evaluated and validated by virus yield reduction assay or modified plaque reduction assay (Barnard et al., 2004; Matrosovich et al., 2006) . Thus, the true, false positives would be detected and eliminated from the drug screening process.

The compounds in question seem to be less toxic on day three than on day seven, which implies that the toxicity effects accumulate over time. In addition, cell growth may be slowed leading to apparent cell growth inhibition due to depletion of nutrients and acid build up in the medium after seven days of incubation. These two phenomena probably contributed to the apparent increase in toxicity as measured by the IC 50 values in the sevenday, NR assay. Furthermore, because of the additional factors contributing to cell toxicity a more accurate assay for detecting cell toxicity is conducted in follow-up studies for active compounds using rapidly-dividing MA-104 cells, which are incubated for 3 days in the absence of virus and measured by NR uptake. In essence, the three-day, EGFP assay may be more accurate compared to the seven-day, NR assay for measuring cell toxicity.",

Overall, the use of the rHPIV3-EGFP virus in initial antiviral drug testing reduces the amount of time needed to obtain results and may be beneficial when testing numerous compounds in a highthroughput format. These conclusions warrant the replacement of the HPIV-3 WT virus with the rHPIV3-EGFP virus in initial antiviral testing. Finally, additional research to improve the three-day, EGFP assay might include scaling-up to a 384-well plate format and the development of a non-green fluorescent dye to replace NR in cell toxicity measurements. EGFP inserted into the rHPIV3 viral antigenome as the first gene. (a) The 852 bp EGFP PCR product was inserted into a natural DrdI site located between the N gene's start signal and start codon. The reverse primer that was used to amplify EGFP's ORF was designed to encode the HPIV-3 gene end and gene start signals. T7/le indicates that a T7 promoter precedes the rHPIV3 5\u2032 antigenomic leader sequence. tr/Rib indicates a hepatitis delta ribozyme immediately follows the rHPIV3 3\u2032 antigenomic trailer sequence. (b) Sequence data showing three intentional mutations and recombinant markers: A to G, destroying a natural SphI site (* indicating destroyed) located in the 5\u2032 noncoding region of the L gene (a), and A to C and T to G, creation of a unique DraIII site located within the 3\u2032 trailer region (a). (c) Electrophoresis of PCR fragments from HPIV-3 WT (1), rHPIV3 (2), and rHPIV3-EGFP (3) digested with SphI. Infectious assays comparing the recombinant HPIV-3 virus, expressing EGFP, to the wild-type and recombinant viruses. (a) Single step growth curve. HPIV-3 WT (\u25a0), rHPIV3 (\u25b2), and rHPIV3-EGFP (\u2022) were used to separately infect 12-well plates seeded with MA-104 cells at MOI = 2. Individual cells were harvested every six hours, including 0 hour, and viral titers were measured by plaque assay. The growth curve for rHPIV3 was not significantly different compared to the growth curve for HPIV-3 WT (p>0.01), while the growth curve for rHPIV3-EGFP was significantly different compared to the growth curves for HPIV-3 WT and rHPIV3 (p<0.01). (b) Time course of virus induced CPE. HPIV-3 WT (\u25a0) and rHPIV3-EGFP (\u2022) were used to infect MA-104 cells at MOI = 0.1 in 96-well plates. Each day, including day 0, the cells of one plate were stained with NR for 2 hours, washed once with PBS, and the NR extracted with ethanol:S\u00f6renson's citrate buffer for 30 min rocking. Absorbance was measured on a spectrophotometer using 540 and 405 nm wavelengths. Percents were calculated based on NR reduction in infected cells compared to uninfected cell controls. No significant differences were detected (p>0.01). Relative expression differences in L gene transcription (c) and genomic replication (d) were measured by QRT-PCR. MA-104 cells infected with HPIV-3 EGFP expression curve. 96-Well plates were seeded with MA-104 cells and infected with rHPIV3-EGFP at differing MOIs: 1 (\u25c6), 0.1 (\u25a0), 0.01 (\u25b2), 0.001 (\u2022). Each day, including day 0, the cell monolayer was washed once with PBS and fluorescence measured. HPIV-3 WT and rHPIV3 infections were also done in parallel but no fluorescence was detected (data not shown).

The cDNAs were amplified using HPIV-3 specific primers, which were tagged with FAM. Delta-C T relative expression differences were calculated for each virus at each time point, using the 0 hour measurement for each virus as the calibrator. Significant reductions were seen in rHPIV3-EGFP genomic replication and L gene transcription compared to HPIV-3 WT",
