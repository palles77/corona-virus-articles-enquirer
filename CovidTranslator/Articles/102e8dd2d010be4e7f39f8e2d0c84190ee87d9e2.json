We report the first application to our knowledge of this technology to the analysis of RNA from a CD4 \u0609 T cell line infected with intact HIV. We sequenced the total mRNA from infected cells and detected differences in the expression of both host and viral mRNA. Viral reads represented a large portion of the total mapped sequencing reads: approximately 20% at 12 h postinfection (hpi) and 40% at 24 hpi. We also detected a small but significant suppression of T cell activation-related genes at 12 hpi. This suppression persisted and expanded by 24 hpi, providing new possible markers of virus-induced T cell cytopathology. By 24 hpi, the expression of over 50% of detectable host loci was also altered, indicating widespread alteration of host processes, including RNA processing, splicing, and transport to an extent not previously reported. In addition, next-generation sequencing provided insights into alternative viral RNA splice events and the expression of noncoding RNAs, including microRNA host genes.",

Infected CD4 \u03e9 T cells undergo fundamental changes that eventually result in cell death and the release of new virus particles (reviewed in references 1 and 2). Following the uptake of virus, the viral genome is reverse transcribed and integrated into the host genome. The host machinery is then used to produce viral transcripts that are either spliced into smaller transcripts that serve as the template for viral proteins or left unspliced to be incorporated into new virus particles. Microarray analyses have shown that infected cells respond to these assaults with gene expression changes in a number of pathways, including apoptosis, cell cycle, cholesterol biosynthesis, and inflammation (3) (4) (5) ; reference 1 and references therein).",

A sim-ilar initial interferon response is seen in the natural host, African green monkeys, but it eventually subsides and the infection resolves (6) .

At 12 hpi, viral mRNA could be detected in infected cells at appreciable levels (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Few cells expressed the viral antigen p24 Gag, and visually, the cells appeared to be intact. By 24 hpi, high copy numbers of viral mRNA were present (Fig. S1 ). Nearly all cells showed the presence of p24 Gag antigen, syncytia were observed, and nonsyncytial cells had increased in volume. By 28 hpi, the effects of viral infection were more pronounced. The amount of viral RNA peaked (Fig. S1 ), and cell viability decreased. The bulk of cell death occurred between 32 and 48 hpi.",

For each sample, we obtained on average over 21 million 75-nucleotide (nt) reads mapping to either HIV or human genomes. A large number of reads mapped to the viral genome (2.5 to 8 million depending on the time point, see Table S1 in the supplemental material). By 12 hpi, viral reads constituted~18% of the total mapped reads, and by 24 hpi, this proportion increased to~38%. Reads mapping to the viral genome indicated the presence of RNA splicing events. In addition to splicing events involving known splice sites, we also observed evidence of five splicing events involving one or more previously unobserved splice sites (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material).

To characterize the host response to HIV infection, we mapped the remaining nonviral reads to RefSeq-annotated human gene loci and quantified them as FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments). We selected a set of 34 host genes whose expression spanned a range of values and measured the expression levels directly by qPCR (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Measurements by NGS showed a high degree of correlation with qPCR results at both time points (R \u03ed 0.97 and R \u03ed 0.98 at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively), indicating a close match between the two methods. We then identified specific host genes that were differentially expressed (DE) during infection. Comparing FPKM for each gene in infected cells to time-matched mock-infected cells, we found that a total of 106 genes were DE at 12 hpi (representing all fold changes with Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P values of less than 0.05; Table 1 ). By 24 hpi, the number of DE genes had increased to 5,006 representing over 50% of all 9,992 gene loci detected under stringent criteria (Table 1) . Closer examination of these values showed that a large proportion of DE genes occurred with smallmagnitude changes. In particular, 69% (73 of 106) and 49% (2,465 of 5,006) of the expressed genes exhibited 1-to 1.5-fold changes at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively ( Table 1 ). The observed precision of the sequencing-based measurements (Fig. S3 ) supported the use of low-fold change thresholds. Other values for the statistical threshold were also used, and for all but the most stringent thresholds (when fewer than 10 genes were observed to be up-or downregulated at 12 hpi), a similar predominance of small-magnitude changes was observed (see Table S2 in the supplemental material).",

We determined the possible impact of these DE genes by analyzing the corresponding annotations (biological processes, molecular functions, and pathways) using the NIH DAVID resource. We found that T cell activation and differentiation were the most overrepresented annotations among DE host genes at 12 hpi overall ( Fig. 2A) . Other annotations associated with DE genes included protein kinase regulation, DNA recombination, and caspase activity regulation ( Fig. 2A ). In addition, several of the DE genes at 12 hpi encoded transcriptional regulators; these genes include EGR1, KLF13, and MYC. Interestingly, four of the nine genes DE at 12 hpi but not at 24 hpi also encoded transcriptional regulators (CREB3L3, HEXIM1, ZNF660, and ZKSCAN4), indicating regulation specific to early viral replication. Seven genes contributed to the overrepresentation of T cell activation among DE genes at 12 hpi (BCL11B, CD1D, EGR1, IKZF1, IRF1, RAG1, and SOX4), six of which were downregulated, indicating a net suppression of T cell activation (as T cell differentiation in Fig. 2 ). Five T cell activation-related DE genes (BCL11B, EGR1, IRF1, IKZF1, and SOX4) encoded transcription factors, some of which had known relevance to HIV infection. For example, the BCL11B gene product binds directly to the HIV-1 sample relative to averaged time-matched mock-infected cell samples. Genes were segregated by the direction of change relative to mock infection at 12 hpi, and hierarchical clustering was done within each directional group. Genes that were not also DE at 24 hpi (purple type) and genes that were also DE at 24 hpi but with changed directionality (gold type) are indicated. Annotations indicate overrepresented categories in DAVID (Fig. 2 ). Matches to top-scoring categories in each DAVID annotation cluster (matching numbers in Fig. 2 ) (solid black squares) and matches to related categories in the same DAVID cluster as the top-scoring category (solid gray squares) are indicated. reg, regulation. long terminal repeat (LTR) and inhibits LTR expression (9) . BCL11B downregulation may therefore allow more efficient HIV-1 replication. Other DE genes related to T cell activation not encoding transcription factors also had known relevance to HIV infection. For example, the CD1D product presents lipid antigens on the surface and is directed by HIV-1 Nef for internalization and degradation (10) . Downregulation of CD1D at the mRNA level would further reduce surface expression and facilitate immune evasion.",

T cell activation and differentiation continued to be overrepresented and were associated with an increased number of DE genes (as lymphocyte differentiation [ Fig. 2B] ). Other fundamental cellular functions associated with DE genes at 24 hpi included DNA metabolism, transcription, mRNA processing and splicing, translation, protein degradation, and cell cycle control (Fig. 2B ).

A network depicting known interactions among proteins encoded by T cell activation-related DE genes at 24 hpi showed two highly connected nodes: LCK (lymphocytespecific protein kinase) and TP53 (p53), both of which were strongly downregulated at 24 hpi (Fig. 3A) . Our observed downregulation of TP53 differed from the upregulation observed in previous microarray studies and may indicate a cell type-specific effect (1) . Genes involved in other core T cell functions, such as proliferation, survival, and antigen presentation, were also downregulated at 24 hpi. These genes included CD1D, CD28, CXCR4, TNFRSF4, and TREML2. TOB1 (transducer of ERBB2), a negative regulator of T cell activation, proliferation, and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production, showed increased expression and may contribute to the downregulation observed in other genes (data not shown).

In particular, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis shared many DE genes at 24 hpi with another top annotation cluster, RNA processing. This set of genes encoding the ribonucleoprotein component of the RNA processing machinery was almost entirely downregulated and included many members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) families. In a network identifying interactions among the proteins encoded by these genes, a number were found to be highly connected (Fig. 3B ). One of these was HNRNPA1 whose gene product regulates the splicing of eukaryotic and viral mRNA (13) . HNRNPA1 and other hnRNP gene products are known to affect the localization of HIV-1 Gag/Pol mRNA, and their overexpression has previously been shown to reduce HIV-1 replication (Fig. 3B) (14) . Other DE genes at 24 hpi related to ribonucleoprotein biogenesis and RNA processing are also known to affect HIV-1 replication directly; these genes include TARDBP (TAR DNA-binding protein 43) whose protein binds the transactivation response (TAR) element of integrated HIV-1 DNA and represses HIV-1 transcription (15) (16) (17) .

Host factors for RNA transport are known to be coopted by HIV-1 to allow the export of unspliced, partially spliced, or fully spliced viral mRNAs out of the nucleus (18) . In particular, the host factors Crm1 (exportin 1) and Ran GTPase are used for the export of unspliced viral mRNA, while the host factor NXF1 (nuclear RNA export factor 1) facilitates the export of fully spliced viral mRNA in a Ran-independent manner (19) . In our data set, we observed no change in the expression of the Crm1-encoding gene XPO1, but several members of the Ran signaling pathway were downregulated, suggesting that the overall export of unspliced viral RNA was suppressed (see Fig. S5B in the supplemental material; data not shown for XPO1). However, in contrast to other RNA transport-related genes, NXF1 and NXF3 were expressed more highly in infected cells, suggesting that HIV infection may have selectively enhanced the export of fully spliced viral RNA (Fig. S5B) .",

Despite the presence of an almost equal number of up-and downregulated genes at 24 hpi, relatively few gene sets (functions, processes, or pathways) were associated with upregulated genes. When up-and downregulated DE genes at 24 hpi were analyzed separately, more annotation clusters were observed among downregulated genes (70 versus 13 among upregulated genes with significance defined by modified Fisher's exact test as P \u03fd 0.05). A similar result was obtained by GSEA (see Fig. S6A and S6B in the supplemental material). These results suggested that upregulated genes were distributed across many gene sets with few occurring in particular functions or pathways. Among the few upregulated pathways were stress-activated/Jnk cascade signaling and ion transport (Fig. S6C) . Consistent with these observations, HIV-1 Nef has been shown to activate Jnk signaling, ultimately activating the caspase cascade and triggering cell death (20) . The triggering of apoptosis at 24 hpi is consistent with our observation that infected cells began to die following the 24-hpi time point.",

In most cases, the functions of these noncoding RNAs and their relevance to infection remains unknown. One noncoding RNA of interest, the microRNA host gene MIR17HG, encoded a cluster of microRNAs and was strongly downregulated during infection. While our method of RNA library preparation precluded direct detection of mature microRNAs, the NGS data set allowed the expression of both regulators and targets of microRNAs to also be observed. For example, we observed a concurrent upregulation of the known target host gene PCAF, a cellular factor required for HIV replication (25) . In contrast to Triboulet et al. (25) who observed that PCAF was upregulated at the protein level but not the mRNA levels in infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB-MCs), we found that PCAF was upregulated at the mRNA level in infected SUP-T1 cells. This may indicate alternative modes of PCAF regulation in different cell types. In addition, MIR17HGencoded microRNAs have hundreds of other candidate targets in the TargetScan database (26) . Several of these candidates were found to be coexpressed with PCAF in our data set, including KLF3 (unpublished data). KLF3 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor whose precise function is unknown but whose sequence is located proximally to a single-nucleotide polymorphism strongly associated with HIV-1 plasma levels (27) . We also observed differential expression of factors that may have mediated MIR17HG downregulation. For example, O'Donnell et al. (28) found that c-Myc regulates expression of MIR17HG. Consistent with that study, we observed that MYC and MIR17HG were concordantly expressed, as MYC was downregulated at 12 and 24 hpi (Fig. 1) . MYC suppression by HIV-1 may therefore underlie a number of subsequent of transcriptional events.",

We also observed discordance between the large amount of viral RNA present (~20% of total mappable RNA) and the limited amount of altered host gene expression at 12 hpi (~1% of detectable gene loci). That is, despite the use of host machinery and the presence of foreign mRNA, host transcription remained relatively unchanged. This result suggests that at 12 hpi, viral transcription occurred on top of largely undisturbed transcription of host genes. The host genes that we detected as differentially expressed at 12 hpi showed that T cell activation and differentiation were suppressed in in- fected cells, likely via the downregulation of T cell activationspecific transcription factors (BCL11B, IRF1, IKZF1, and SOX4) . The regulation of these and transcription factors specific for other functions (e.g., EGR1, KLF13, and MYC) may explain how HIV initiated replication with minimal disruption to host gene expression at 12 hpi but elicited larger-scale changes later in infection.",

For example, Sirois et al.

Our study utilized the CXCR4-tropic strain LAI, and it would be interesting to generate NGS data for a CCR5-tropic virus for comparison.

By 24 hpi, extensive reprogramming of the host transcriptome affecting a multitude of pathways had occurred. Remarkably, these large-scale changes occurred without concerted upregulation of innate immunity at the gene set level, suggesting that HIV-1 evaded viral sensing mechanisms. By this time point, the most affected pathways related to RNA fate determination, including RNA processing. While HIV-related RNA processing has been studied intensively, the contribution of most host factors remains incompletely defined (32) . Modulation of this pathway by the virus may allow the proportion of unspliced, partially spliced, and fully spliced HIV RNA to be adjusted depending on the stage of the HIV life cycle. Our finding that over 150 genes related to RNA processing were differentially expressed suggests that HIV-1 infection results in a more complete modulation of RNA processing than previously identified (5, 33) . However, our observed downregulation of RNA processing was consistent with results from an earlier study using NGS to investigate changes in CD4 \u03e9 T lymphoblasts infected with an HIV-based, nonreplication-competent vector at 24 hpi (34) . Altered regulation of this and other pathways has been observed using microarrays as well, although in general, we observed changes in greater numbers of genes affecting these pathways using NGS (3, 5, 33, 35, 36) .",

In an analysis of HIV-related PPI data, van Dijk et al. (37) identified sets of human proteins highly connected to host and viral proteins (37) . Several proteins related to T cell activation were identified as highly connected; these proteins included CD4, CXCR4, and LCK (see Table S4 in the supplemental material). Downregulation of these members, as we observed, would therefore potentially affect the functions of many other proteins as well. Together, these data emphasize the high degree to which HIV-1 suppressed this pathway. In addition, many of the pathways associated with DE genes were identified as essential for HIV-1 replication in a recent meta-analysis of siRNA-based screen data (38) . These pathways included DNA binding, RNA splicing, RNA export, nuclear transport, and protein complex assembly (Table S3) . While the siRNA data suggest that HIV-1 ini-tially requires these pathways to be active to establish an infection, our data suggest that HIV-1 also later suppresses and inactivates these pathways during active replication.",

We determined the scaling factor for each sample as the median difference of the corresponding quantile values of the sample and reference. Only genes/transcripts with raw FPKM values of \u05461 in all samples were considered in the estimation of scaling factors. We retained those genes/transcripts with nonzero FPKM values in 100% of the samples of at least one biological condition (our detection criterion). An offset of 1 was added to all normalized values to facilitate the comparisons involving one or more FPKM values of zero and to reduce the variability of the log ratios for low expression values. Transcripts were mapped to RefSeq gene loci, resulting in 9,992 loci with detectable reads. The data are available at http://www .viromics.washington.edu or upon request. The normalized expression data were analyzed for differential expression by using linear model methods as implemented in the R package limma (46) . P values were derived from linear model-based t tests between infected and time-matched mock-infected samples. Unless otherwise noted, we defined differential expression by Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P values of less than 0.05 based on the assumption that a false discovery rate of 5% provided an acceptable balance of false-positive control and statistical power. Fold changes (FC) were derived from comparing the means of these groups, and multiple groupings of fold changes were used (1.0 to 1.5 FC, 1.5 to 2.0 FC, and 2.0\u03e9 FC) based on previous observed fold change ranges observed in high-throughput and in particular NGS data in virus-infected systems (8) .",
