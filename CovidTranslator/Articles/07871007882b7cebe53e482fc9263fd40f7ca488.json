The prediction of the amount and position for the transmembrane protein helical segments (TMHs) is the hot spot in bioinformatics. In this paper, a new approach, maximum spectrum of continuous wavelet transform (MSCWT), is proposed to predict TMHs. The predictions for eight SARS-CoV membrane proteins indicate that MSCWT has the same capacity with software TMpred. Moreover, the test on a dataset of 131 structure-known proteins with 548 TMHs shows that the prediction accuracy of MSCWT for TMHs is 91.6% and that for membrane protein is 89.3%. maximum spectrum of continuous wavelet transform (MSCWT), membrane protein, transmembrane protein helical segments (TMHs)",

Then, a sliding window was used to scan the signal. The probable TMHs were predicted by a reasonable threshold. Von Heijine proposed the well-known 'positive-inside rule' [4] , which provided a further guide for prediction. Multiple sequence alignment information of membrane proteins was also used in such prediction [5] . From view of method used, besides of neural networks and sliding window technique [4, 5] , Markov model was also used [6] . In a Markov model, seven states were designed to re-spond to seven regions of membrane protein, namely, mohelix core, cap cyt, cap non-cyt, loop cyt, short loop non-cyt, long loop non-cyt and globular [6] . In literature [7] , the inclinations that each amino acid occurred in seven regions were computed. Then, the prediction was achieved by dynamic programming algorithm. Similarly with literature [7] , literature [8, 9] also achieved the prediction based on amino acid occurrence frequency. The improvement was the prediction for transmembrane directions.",

Moreover, it can be used to analyze the finer structures of proteins. Figure 1 shows the TMHs predicted by MSCWT and TMpred for SARS-CoV protein Orf9 and Orf14. For the predictions of TMpred (subplot a' and b'), solid line and dotted line represent two model signals. i\u2192o and o\u2192i indicate the direction from inner membrane to outer membrane and vice versa, respectively. The predictions for eight SARS-CoV proteins are listed in Table 1 . From Figure 1 and Table 1 , it is concluded as follows: (1) MSCWT amplifies the profile of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, which is helpful in observing the changes of protein hydrophobia. The great peaks in MSCWT respond to the changes of hydrophobias, which is the characteristics of TMHs. In fact, the MSCWT curve more than the threshold (1.5) denotes TMHs. Figure 1 shows that the predictions by MSCWT are in consistence with those by TMpred, indicating MSCWT has a good precision. (2) In this paper, CWT is performed on a scale range, which makes that the large scale corresponds to lower frequencies of signals while small scale to high frequencies. Thus, MSCWT can be used to study the global properties of signals as well as local properties. In MSCWT, large span peaks are not very smooth and contain some small peaks, indicating the hydrophobias vary with residue positions in TMHs, which suggests that the protein has fine folding structure in TMHs and such information can be observed by MSCWT. This is why those small peaks are not filtered. Our experi- Figure 1 Comparison of MSCWT and TMpred in predicting the SARS-CoV proteins Orf9 and Orf14. The longitudinal axis is defined by forecast signals, and the transverse axis is defined by points at transmembrane protein sequences. (a) MSCWT for Orf9, TMHs predicted is from 8 to 30; (b) MSCWT for Orf14, TMHs predicted is from 36 to 58; (c) Tmpred for Orf9, TMHs predicted is from 9 to 30; (d) Tmpred for Orf14, TMHs predicted is from 36 to 58. In TMpred, solid line and dotted line represent two signals suggested, i\u2192o indicates the direction from inner membrane to outer membrane, and o\u2192i indicates the reverse direction. For the accuracy rate of TMHs, TMpred is 93.1%; MSCWT is 89.7%; and DAS is 89.0%. MSCWT has the highest accuracy rate of membrane protein sequence (84.6%), while TMpred and DAS are 75.4% and 80.0%, respectively. All the above indicates that MSCWT has a relatively high performance among the existing methods.",

MSCWT reports 530 transmembrane regions, in which, 81 regions are false-positive. 18 regions are not predicted yet, and the leakage rate is 3.3%. Among 131 protein sequences, 117 sequences are correctly predicted. The accuracy rate of TMHs is 91.6% and the accuracy rate for membrane protein sequences is 89.3%.In addition, 65 membrane proteins are chosen from the above test dataset as the new testing dataset in their original order. The new dataset is predicted by software TMpred and DAS, and the results are shown inTable 2.The difference among these methods is not obvious. Compared with the two methods, the leakage amount of MSCWT is 13. The number of TMpred and DAS are 33 and 30, respectively.",
