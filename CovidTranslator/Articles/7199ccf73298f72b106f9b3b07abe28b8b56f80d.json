Traditional density gradient purification of VLPs does not enable complete elimination of BV-derived impurities, including live viruses, envelope glycoprotein gp64 and baculoviral DNA. We used an additional purification system based on ionic strength to purify norovirus (NoV) GII-4 capsid-derived VLPs. The anion exchange chromatography purification led to highly purified VLPs free from BV impurities with intact morphology. In addition, highly purified VLPs induced strong NoV-specific antibody responses in BALB/ c mice. Here, we describe a method for NoV VLP purification and several methods for determining their purity, including quantitative PCR for BV DNA detection.",

The recombinant BV expression system in insect cells was developed for protein expression in the 1980s and has since been used in a wide range of applications because many proteins require folding, subunit assembly, and extensive posttranslational modification to be biologically active [18, 54, 57] . This expression system is highly effective in producing large quantities of recombinant viral capsid and envelope proteins that spontaneously assemble into viruslike particles (VLPs) inside the cytoplasm of infected insect cells [18, 33, 42, 54] . These VLPs are morphologically and antigenically similar to native viruses [33] but lack the replicative capacity of the virus, are non-infectious, and do not contain any genetic material. VLPs, moreover, are commonly stable in storage and relatively acid and heat stable [5, 19, 33] . VLPs provide a valuable alternative in the development of diagnostic assays for immunological and epidemiological studies.",

VLPs used for research purposes are commonly purified by density gradient centrifugation based on separation by size [5, 9, 16, 24, 28, 33, 50] . These methods result in particles with a purity greater than 80 % [19] but do not readily discriminate between VLPs and BVs [17, 47] . Therefore, BV is likely to be present in many of these preparations, and moreover, BVs have been shown to have an adjuvant effect-especially live BVs [27, 51] . Purification procedures based on chromatography have been shown to remove the contaminating BV in VLP preparations [35, 36, 43, 60, 61] . The purification technique affects the structural characteristics, immunogenicity, morphological integrity, antigenicity and functionality of purified VLPs [13, 28, 35, 45] .",

Fractions 15-17 were completely negative when analyzed by immunoblot using BV gp64-specific monoclonal antibody, indicating the absence of BV contamination (data not shown). Further optimization of the steps of the purification process were undertaken to improve the yield of the pure NoV capsid protein. First, different concentrations of NaCl (0.5 M, 1 M and 1.5 M) were used to test the effect of the ionic strength of the elution buffer (50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 ). Second, the concentration of the protein sample loaded onto the column was also optimized. The best purity and yield were obtained with 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 -0.5 M NaCl buffer, and the optimum amount of crude purified VLPs was 500 lg/ column (data not shown). After the first anion exchange chromatography step, fractions 15-17 were pooled and applied to the second, fresh column. The analysis of collected fractions of the second anion exchange chromatography is shown in Fig. 3A . The three fractions (15) (16) (17) containing NoV VLPs were collected, pooled, dialyzed against PBS and sterile-filtered. Immunoblotting of each fraction confirmed the lack of BV gp64 impurities (Fig. 3B) .",

The identity of the NoV VLPs was demonstrated by immunoblotting using an NoV GII-4specific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4A) . The results showed doublets of NoV capsid proteins [28] without detectable degradation products. Probing with a BV-gp64specific monoclonal antibody did not detect any BV gp64 protein (Fig. 4B ). Densitometric analysis of the SDS-PAGE confirmed that the NoV VLPs were [90 % pure. The presence of live BV was analyzed as well. As seen in Fig. 4C , duplicate wells of the purified VLP sample completely lacked live BVs in contrast to the mock BV sample wells, which contained *10 9 pfu/ml live BV, as determined using a BacPak Rapid Titer Kit. The total DNA content in the pure VLP sample was also quantified, and some residual DNA was detected, but the DNA content was very low (0.41 ng/ll). In addition, the genomic BV DNA was quantified using BV Q-PCR. BacPAK control BV DNA template was used to create a standard curve (Fig. 5) . Purified NoV VLPs contained only a few copies of the BV DNA (Table 1; Fig. 5 ). From the copies of BV DNA in a pure sample, the amount of BV DNA was calculated to be \\0.001 pg/ll. EM examination of the purified samples revealed that the structural characteristics (protein assembly into VLPs) and morphological integrity were not affected by the purification process (Fig. 4D) and were similar to those of the gradientpurified VLPs (Fig. 4E) . Chromatographically purified NoV VLPs of approx. 40 nm in size were seen in every grid square. NoV VLPs were not contaminated with bacterial endotoxin, as we detected\\0.1 EU/10 lg of protein; an amount that is below the international standard of B30 EU/20 lg of protein [41] . The purified VLPs were sterile and stable for at least 5 months at 4\u00b0C in PBS, pH 7.4 (data not shown). To determine the effect of anion exchange chromatographic purification on the immunogenicity of the VLPs, BALB/c mice were immunized with pure NoV GII-4 VLPs at 1 and 10 lg doses without external adjuvants. NoV-GII-4-specific serum antibody responses were induced by each dose of pure NoV VLP (Fig. 6) . The IgG response was already quite high after the first immunization and was increased after the second dose at three weeks (Fig. 6A) . NoV-specific IgG subtypes were measured to determine the Th1 and Th2 responses [10] . All test groups had similar levels of NoV-specific IgG1 (Fig. 6B) and IgG2a (Fig. 6C) antibodies. Negative control mice lacked detectable NoVspecific antibodies.",

We investigated BV-derived impurities in the sucrosegradient-purified NoV GII-4 VLPs. The major protein impurity (close to 10 %, determined by densitometric analysis) came from envelope glycoprotein gp64 of BV. The BV gp64 is also linked to adjuvant behavior [2, 23] . gp64 contains a mannose-binding residue, which is expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells. Abe et al. [2] have suggested that gp64 recognizes a Toll-like receptor (TLR) and activates the immune response by inducing inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-c (TNF-c) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The anionexchange-chromatography-purified NoV VLP preparations were examined for expression-vector-related protein impurities. Densitometrical SDS-PAGE analyses as well as immunoblotting identified NoV capsid protein with [90 % purity and without the traces of BV gp64 protein.",

            "text": "To obtain extremely pure VLPs, several chromatography steps are required [35, 45, 63] , but repeated chromatography steps can affect the conformation of VLPs [11] . Purification procedures that preserve the intact conformation of VLPs are important because recombinant VLPs are inherently unstable and tend to denature and aggregate in solution [11, 55] . We used a purification procedure with a combination of two anion exchange chromatography steps in order to minimize impurities and to obtain structurally intact NoV VLPs. Our results show that NoV VLPs purified by two anion exchange chromatography steps retain the structure of the icosahedral capsids and show excellent stability, comparable to densitygradient-purified VLPs (Fig. 4D, E) . It has been reported that ion exchange chromatography is the process of choice for removing to the flowthrough pool host-cell protein and DNA [34, 60, 65] . The anion exchange chromatography method is based on adsorption and reversible binding of charged samples. The major DNA impurities in the VLP preparations come from the baculoviral DNA and not the host cells [27] . Abe and colleagues [1] have shown that BV DNA contains unmethylated CpG motifs that induce proinflammatory cytokines through the TLR-9/MYD88-dependent signaling pathway. Another group has also reported that BV DNA may be responsible for the adjuvant properties of BVs [27] . Our results show that the number of copies of BV DNA was extremely low ( Fig. 5 ; Table 1 ) in the pure NoV VLP preparation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the number of copies of BV DNA in an NoV VLP preparation by the quantitative BV Q-PCR method. The total dsDNA content in the pure NoV VLP preparation was low (0.9 ng/1-lg dose). In the case of VLP-based vaccine production, the residual DNA needs to be removed to reach acceptable threshold values, typically 10 ng/dose [15] . One group has shown that only live BV was able to stimulate innate immunity, which was not due to the presence of viral DNA [23] . Therefore the presence and quantity of live BVs in the pure VLP preparation were determined. The infectious BV titer was 0 pfu/ml, confirming the complete absence of recombinant live BV in the preparations of pure NoV VLP.",

Balanced Th1-type and Th2-type immune response (reflected as IgG2a and IgG1 antibody production) [10] was generated with the VLPs in the absence of external adjuvants. Although we performed no head-to-head comparison of immunogenicity of classical density-gradient-purified and chromatographically purified NoV VLPs, the results obtained in the present study are comparable to those obtained previously with a crude preparation of purified VLPs [10, 58] . These results indicate that pure NoV VLPs are extremely potent immunogens. Others have also shown that compared to soluble individual proteins, multivalent structures of VLPs induce strong B cell and T cell responses in the absence of adjuvants [19, 31] . Finally, we have described a relatively straightforward chromatography method for purification of NoV VLP and Fig. 6 NoV capsid-specific antibody responses of BALB/c mice immunized twice intradermally (ID) with 1 lg or 10 lg of pure NoV GII-4 VLPs. (A) Serum samples collected at study weeks 0 (prebleed), 2, 3, 4 and 5 were tested by ELISA for NoV-specific IgG. The arrows indicate immunization points at study weeks 0 and 3. NoVspecific serum IgG1 (B) and IgG2a (C) subtype antibody responses. Mean ODs of the groups with standard errors are shown. Control mice were left unvaccinated methods to confirm their purity. The purified VLPs were tested for impurities including BV protein, DNA, live BV and other impurities related to the expression system. Most significantly, the purified NoV capsid VLPs retained their morphological and antigenic features as well as their immunogenicity. Recombinant NoV VLP vaccine candidates are in the early phases of development [4, 10, 59] . Some research groups have used intranasally delivered NoV VLPs in small animals as well as in human challenge studies [4, 59] . In addition, a vaccine against acute gastroenteritis in young children containing a combination of NoV VLPs and rotavirus VP6 protein is under development [10] . We suggest that this small laboratory-scale purification procedure may potentially be applied for large-scale production of NoV VLPs.",
