            "text": "The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the infectious agent responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and represents one of the largest currently known RNA genomes. It is composed of at least 14 functional ORFs, which encode three classes of proteins, i.e., the structural proteins S, M, E, N, 3a, 7a and 7b, the nonstructural proteins nsp1 to nsp16, and the accessory proteins 3b, 6, 8, 9b and 14 (Snijder et al. 2003) . Nsp3 is the largest of the nonstructural proteins. It is predicted to have multiple functional domains (Snijder et al. 2003) , and large parts of this 1922-residue protein have already been structurally characterized. This includes the functional domains nsp3a, which is a single-stranded RNA-binding protein exhibiting a ubiquitin-like fold (Serrano et al. 2007 ), nsp3b, which has been described as an ADP ribose-1\"-phosphatase (Saikatendu et al. 2005) , and nsp3d, which contains two structural domains involved in the proteolytic processing of the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, and a third structural domain with a ubiquitin-like fold (Ratia et al. 2006) . Further structure determinations of structural domains within the \"SARS-unique\" functional domain nsp3c are in advanced stages. Despite this progress with the structural and functional characterization, the overall physiological role of the nsp3 protein remains poorly understood and further work is required. Here, we report the sequence-specific NMR assignment of the core structural domain of residues 1066-1181 within the functional domain nsp3e, to establish a basis for a next step of structural and functional characterization of nsp3.",

To focus on the globular domain, we cloned the truncated construct nsp3(1066-1181) into the vector pET-25b and expressed the protein in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-RIL CodonPlus (Stratagene). Cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C, induced with 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at an OD 600 of 0.8, and then grown for another 18 h at 18 \u00b0C . For the protein purification, the cells were disrupted by sonication in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, with 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche). The solution was then centrifuged for 30 min at 18000 g and 4 \u00b0C, and the supernatant was loaded with a flow rate of 1 ml/min onto a 5 ml Hitrap Q SP column (Amersham) equilibrated with 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.5, containing 50 mM NaCl. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 50 to 1000 mM, fractionated and monitored at wavelengths of 280 and 254 nm. Fractions containing nsp3(1066-1181) were pooled and concentrated to 10 ml using Amicon ultracentrifugal filter devices with 5kDa cutoff (Millipore). Subsequently, the protein solution was passed through a Superdex 75 size-exclusion column (Amersham). The fractions containing the protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were again pooled and concentrated to a volume of 550 \u03bcl using 5kDa cut-off Amicon ultracentrifugal filter devices (Millipore).",

Growth in M9 minimal medium yielded about 10 mg of pure protein from 1 L of culture.

The figure 2 shows a plot of the deviations of the experimentally observed 13 C chemical shifts from the random coil values, \u0394\u03b4 i , versus the amino acid sequence, where \u0394\u03b4 i is defined as (Metzler et al. 1993) . A positive value for \u0394\u03b4 i indicates that the residue i is located in a regular helical structure, while a negative value indicates that it is located in a regular \u03b2-strand. The tentative positions of regular secondary structures, which are identified at the bottom of the figure, were obtained with the criterion that |\u0394\u03b4 i | \u2265 1 for three or more sequentially adjacent residues. No information is as yet available on the assembly of the \u03b2-strands into \u03b2-sheets. 2D [ 15 N, 1 H]-HSQC spectrum of uniformly [ 13 C, 15 N]-labeled nsp3(1066-1181) (protein concentration 1.4 mM, 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM NaN 3 ). The spectrum was recorded at a 1 H frequency of 600 MHz, T= 25 \u00b0C, with 256 increments in the 15 N dimension and 4 scans/increment. Resonance assignments are indicated by the sequence numbers in the presently studied construct, which correspond to the residues 1066-1181 of nsp3 (see text). Side chain amide resonances were assigned for eight residues of asparagine and glutamine; these are connected by horizontal lines. Deviations from random coil 13 C \u03b1 and 13 C \u03b2 chemical shifts in the protein nsp3(1066-1181) plotted versus the amino acid sequence. The \u0394\u03b4C \u03b1 and \u0394\u03b4C \u03b2 values were determined with the program package ATNOS/CANDID (Herrmann et al. 2002a, b) by subtracting the random coil 13 C \u03b1 and 13 C \u03b2 shifts from the experimentally determined chemical shifts. The \u0394\u03b4 i value for residue i represents a three-point average value over the three consecutive residues i-1, i and i+1, calculated as follows: (Metzler et al. 1993) . A positive value for \u0394\u03b4 i indicates that the residue i is located in a regular helical structure, while a negative value indicates its location in a regular \u03b2-strand. The positions of regular secondary structures indicated at the bottom of the figure were obtained with the criterion that |\u0394\u03b4 i | \u2265 1 for three or more sequentially adjacent residues.",
