Normal flora contributes to this protective barrier against pathogens while paradoxically providing a source for potential opportunistic invasion. Commensal bacteria are those that benefit from living on or within a host without mediating harm. For a relationship to be commensal, it must be mutually beneficial, and the interruption of this association results in abnormal host development or overt disease. 1 A pathogen is any disease-producing organism; thus a commensal organism has the potential to be pathogenic. Colonization is infection without disease. Skin, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital colonization occurs early in life and persists unless disrupted.",

Changes in cecal weight, villusto-crypt ratio, development of gut immunoglobulin A responses, and volatile fatty acid production are affected by suboptimal cecal colonization in germ-free animals. 9 A relationship between severity of mucosal disease and normal flora also has been demonstrated in models of inflammatory bowel disease of human beings. 10 Bacteria are present in all parts of the intestinal tract of the horse, and the microbial fauna increases in complexity and density aborally. 11 The stomach of the horse is not a sterile environment. A dense population of gram-positive bacterial rods, primarily composed of Lactobacillus spp., colonizes the nonsquamous portion of the equine stomach. Substantial colonization of the duodenum occurs with a large population of proteolytic bacteria, and this colonization increases tenfold in the ileum. 12 Microbial degradation and fermentation of plant material in the large intestine is an important component of nutrient acquisition in the horse. The consumption of cellulose and starch results in the production of volatile fatty acids. 13 The major cellulolytic bacterial species of the large intestine are similar to those of Bovidae, but the strains in the horse produce different arrays of fermentation products. 14 As in cows, Ruminococcus flavefaciens is one of the predominate cellulolytic bacteria of the equine cecum. Overall, gram-negative rods are the most populous bacteria, comprising 50% of flora. Gram-positive rods and cocci each represent around 20% of the bacterial population. Predominant species include members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Butynvibrio spp., Streptococcus spp., Bacteroides spp., Lactobacillus spp., Selenomonas spp., Eubacterium spp., Propionibacterium spp., Staphylococcus spp., and many unclassified rods and cocci. 15 Yeasts and fungi of the order Mucorales have been identified in the cecum of normal horses and are capable of digesting cellulose and starch. 16 The latest investigations demonstrate a lack of intestinal pathogens in the flora of normal horses as detected by routine culturing of feces. In the largest study to date, fecal shedding of Salmonella in normal horses from farms without evidence of salmonellosis was 0.8% in resident horses. 17 Based on limited investigations, the carriage rates of Clostridium difficile in normal horses and foals also appears to be low (<1.5%). 18 Intestinal flora in the horse is an important source for extraintestinal pathogens. In studies examining the carriage rate of Rhodococcus equi, all horses cultured carried the bacteria regardless of age. 19, 20 Furthermore, if the farm had endemic R. equi and respiratory isolates contain the 90-kd plasmid, which has been associated with disease, fecal isolates also contained this plasmid.",

Although the vaginal and vestibular mucosae of mares are colonized with normal mucosal flora, the uterus is considered sterile. However, typical culturing techniques result in frequent isolation of what might be considered pathogens, and cytologic examination and bacterial counts are important supplemental tests for detecting true infection. Colony counts less than 10 colony-forming units and lack of inflammatory cells indicate uterine or technical contamination. 21 Many bacteria inhabit the external genitalia of stallions, including those considered to be associated with metritis in mares. The predominant aerobe isolated is coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., followed by Corynebacterium spp., \u03b1-hemolytic Streptococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp. Pathogens such as \u03b2-hemolytic Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella spp. can be found frequently in servicing stallions. 22, 23 Pregnancy rates appear to be the same in mares bred to stallions with semen infected with P. aeruginosa. 24 ",

Long-term antibiotic use, immunosuppression, and compromised organ function especially involving the pulmonary or endocrine system are three primary host factors highly associated with establishment of opportunistic fungal infection.

For skin infections, colonization of experimentally induced wounds with Staphylococcus spp. depends on inoculum size. 27 Thus control of surgical and wound hygiene depends on agents to which Staphylococcus is sensitive. The occurrence of diarrhea has been demonstrated to be dose-dependent in salmonellosis in calves, 28 but little is known regarding challenge dose in the foal or the adult horse. Minimal inoculum size is required for certain pathogens that form toxins, such as Escherichia coli and Clostridium spp. For instance, disease in human beings caused by E. coli 0157:H7 requires a small inoculum, and other factors such as diet or antibiotics promote colonization of a few organisms, resulting in severe disease. 29 ",

Thus proper dose and length of antibiotic exposure is important in preventing the development of these isolates. 33, 34 High-grade resistance is associated with multidrug resistance. 35 In high-grade and multidrug forms of antibiotic resistance, clonal expansion of small numbers of isolates occurs. 35 Individual carrier animals and persons are important for high-grade and multidrug resistance in addition to selective antibiotic pressure. Of note is the fact that commensal or noninvasive pathogens have higher reportage rates for resistance, whereas more highly pathogenic or invasive organisms have less resistance. Thus virulence and antibiotic resistance are not synonymous. Because commensal organisms are ubiquitous, they have a higher likelihood of contact with bacteria that have multiresistance genes. Thus commensal organisms eventually become a reservoir for resistance genes. 36 ",

            "text": "As stated earlier, development of disease is caused by disruption of normal flora and invasion by a pathogen or the conversion of a common commensal organism into a pathogen. The pathophysiology of certain types of equine colitis and pleuropneumonia provide examples consistent with each of these two circumstances. Disruption of normal gastrointestinal flora is likely the underlying pathogenic mechanism for development of acute enterocolitis. Development of colitis in the horse, presumably from disruption of fecal flora, has been associated with feed change, antibiotics, surgery, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and transport. [37] [38] [39] Rapid change from a roughage diet to concentrate results in increased numbers of anaerobes, decreased numbers of cellulolytic bacteria, decreased cecal protozoa diversity, and decreased pH in the equine cecum. 37 Isolation of Clostridium difficile increases in horses administered antibiotics, and C. difficile diarrhea associated with ampicillin, erythromycin, penicillin, and potentiated sulfonamides has been reported in adult horses. 38, 40 In ponies infected with Salmonella spp., transport and surgery reactivated infection and diarrhea, and antibiotics (oxytetracycline) prolonged shedding. 39 In a case-control study, potentiated sulfonamides were not associated significantly with development of diarrhea in hospitalized horses; however, overall antibiotic use was associated highly with the occurrence of diarrhea. 41 Several mechanisms exist by which antibiotics disrupt normal gastrointestinal flora and intestinal function. These mechanisms include disruption of carbohydrate metabolism, decreased metabolism of bile acids, direct effects on intestinal motility, and alterations in intestinal mucosa. Change in carbohydrate metabolism is a large intestinal event following decreased microbial reduction of carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Because SCFA metabolism and absorption results in fluid and electrolyte absorption, a sudden decrease in SCFAs leads to osmotic diarrhea with intraluminal accumulation of organic acids, cations, and carbohydrates. In human studies, reduced SCFAs have been demonstrated with many antibiotics, including ampicillin, metronidazole, and erythromycin. Bile acids, reduced in the colon by dehydroxylating bacteria, are potent colonic secretogues. Increases in fecal bile acids have been demonstrated in human beings with the use of ampicillin and clindamycin. Erythromycin and amoxicillin directly affect colonic motility. 42 Erythromycin is a motilin receptor agonist that stimulates contraction of antral and duodenal smooth muscles. 43 In the horse, erythromycin results in a dosedependent increase in ileocecal emptying. 44 Motilityenhancing effects also have been observed in human patients treated with amoxicillin. 42 ",

Changes in upper respiratory mucosal flora and transportation are two important elements that contribute to the development of pleuropneumonia in horses. The tonsillar mucosa of the oropharynx is colonized heavily with Streptococcus equi, and necrosis of this tissue occurring during viral infection is associated with spread to the lower respiratory tract. 6 The association of transport as a risk factor for the development of pleuropneumonia in horses was demonstrated in a retrospective study where transport of greater than 500 miles was associated highly with disease. 45 Elevation of the head for an extended duration is an important initiating event. Natural feeding behavior of horses, which results in a lowered head for several hours, is likely an important method for tracheal clearance. Under experimental conditions, elevation of the head for prolonged periods results in an increase in types and multiplication of oral/pharyngeal commensal bacteria within the trachea. 46, 47 Pasteurella, Actinobacillus, and Streptococcus spp. are the most frequent and prolific colonizers of the trachea after prolonged head elevation. In addition to prolonged head elevation imposed by transport, decreased phagocytosis of equine peripheral neutrophils occurs in horses exposed to extended travel. 47 As a result, common commensal bacteria of the oropharynx and upper airways become opportunistic pathogens.",

No central mechanism exists for detecting and documenting nosocomial infection in veterinary medicine, and frequently many such infections go unrecognized. Nosocomial infections are becoming a major problem for large animal veterinary teaching and private referral hospitals. Infections with Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and various Salmonella enteritidis serovars have been reported in association with nosocomial infection in equine patients. [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] Surgical incision infection, joint sepsis, catheter phlebitis, wounds, and diarrhea represent the common clinical nosocomial syndromes reported in horses. 49, [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] When nosocomial infection involves the acquisition of isolates from the hospital environment, these isolates are more difficult to treat because they frequently undergo high-level antibiotic pressure and attain multiresistance. These organisms also have been shown to cross species lines. Reports of nosocomially transmitted salmonellosis in equine hospital wards are increasing, and outbreaks of S. enteritidis serotypes Krefeld, Saint Paul, DT104, and Anatum have demonstrated attainment of cell surface by a chaperone/usher pathway. These pili are made up of multiple major pilin subunits compiling a rigid shaft with minor pili proteins composing the flexible tip. The chaperone is a special bacterial cell protein that prevents the pilus from achieving its final figuration while in the periplasmic space located between the inner and outer membrane before assuming its position on the outer membrane. Salmonella bacteria and uropathogenic Escherichia coli commonly possess type I pili. The K88 and K99 fimbriae of enteropathogenic (EPEC) E. coli are also type I pili. Haemophilus spp. and Klebsiella spp. contain type I pili. Type IV pili are located at the pole of the cell and assembled via the type II secretion system that is called the general assembly pathway. 63, 65 These pili are flexible fibers of variable length that can aggregate, are important in the formation of microcolonies, and are responsible for the twitching motion of bacteria. The proteins are secreted into the periplasmic space but remain anchored to the inner membrane. The protein then is assembled and passed through a pore formed in the outer membrane. This type of pilus commonly is found on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterotoxigenic E. coli, and EPEC. Curli fimbriae are solid surface structures that use the extracellular nucleation/precipitation pathway. 63 This pilus is secreted as a soluble protein extracellularly with a second protein, the nucleator, for stability.",

They also are called \"microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules.\" [68] [69] [70] Gram-positive organisms possess afimbrial proteins on their surfaces that presumably aid in binding to host cells. The three most commonly studied afimbrial adhesins are those that bind salivary glycoprotein, bind fibronectin, or are composed of lipoteichoic acid. 70, 71 Salivary-binding proteins commonly are found in pathogens and commensals of the oral cavity. Streptococcus spp. and Actinomyces spp. possess these proteins. Fibronectin-binding protein (FBP) is necessary for Staphylococcus aureus invasion and binds fibronectin and collagen to form a bridge between the FBP and the host cell integrin (fibronectin integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 ). 72, 73 FBPs are essential for invasion of epithelial and endothelial cells as demonstrated by the fact that Streptococcus pyogenes FBP mutants do not bind to epithelial cells in vitro. [68] [69] [70] Heterologues of FBP have been demonstrated in S. pneumoniae of human beings, S. equi equi, and S. equi zooepidemicus. Other potential equine pathogens that have FDPs on their surface include Actinomyces spp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes. 71, 74 Lipoteichoic acid is a common binding factor found in Streptococcus group A bacteria, and antibodies to this protein inhibit adhesion of the bacteria to cells. 75 This protein is also important in stimulation of cytokine secretion from the cells during infection, and lipoteichoic acid has been demonstrated in group B Streptococcus, including S. equi equi. 76 A less commonly described afibrillar adhesin is composed of surface polypeptide chains in Corynebacterium that bind to lectin. 77 Binding of these proteins can be abolished by trypsin treatment. Afibrillar adhesins are also present in gram-negative organisms, the most commonly studied are conserved high-molecular-weight adhesion proteins of Haemophilus influenzae and Bordetella pertussis. 75 ",

Binding results in actin rearrangement and engulfment of these intracellular bacteria by phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells. Yersinia and Listeria form a zipperlike relationship in which the tightly adhered bacteria result in actin polymerization and formation of a phagocytic cup. 78 This three-stage process is controlled by different proteins, the first of which initiates actin nucleation and branching of filaments. A second protein stimulates actin polymerization and depolymerization, which is followed by activation of a third protein that ends the process. Salmonella and Shigella bacteria adhere and secrete proteins that are translocated into the host cell cytoplasm and trigger actin polymerization.

            "text": "The capsule of bacteria is composed mainly of polysaccharide, which is inherently a poor immunogen. Ultrastucturally, the capsule in E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae is a fine fibrillar meshwork covering the bacteria surface; however, the capsule of Klebsiella is approximately 20 times thicker than that of E. coli. 85 In Enterobacteriaceae, the K antigen is one of the major antigens of this complex and expression is temperature dependent. 86 The presence of certain K antigens and a large capsule, as studied in Klebsiella virulence, is associated highly with increased pathogenicity and resistance to phagocytosis. 87, 88 The other major antigen is the lipopolysaccharide without the lipid A component of the molecule. A third minor component, colanic acid, appears to exhibit antiphagocytic activity in some E. coli. Classically, the presence of capsules on E. coli have been shown to prevent complement-mediated phagocytosis. 89 Lipopolysaccharide itself activates complement, and the capsule prevents immune activation by concealing the lipopolysaccharide molecule. Introduction of the genes associated with production of a more viscous capsule into a bacteria change an avirulent phenotype into a virulent phenotype. 90 As early as 1928 the engulfment and digestion of Streptococcus pneumoniae was observed to be associated with lack of capsule. 91 By 1940 this virulence factor was understood to be genetically encoded. 92 Early studies with S. equi equi demonstrated that resistance to phagocytosis was associated with an increase in capsule and M protein, 93 and in a model of S. equi zooepidemicus infection in mice, enhancement of virulence was associated with increased capsule and resistance to phagocytosis. 94 Although colonization of the guttural pouch occurs with nonencapsulated S. equi equi strains, induction of lymphadenopathy is correlated more to the capsular strains. Recent studies have shown that when M protein content is kept constant, the amount of capsule actually is correlated with resistance to phagocytosis. 95 Resistance to in vitro phagocytosis can be abolished with treatment with hyaluronidase. In support of this, phagocytosis of S. equi equi and S. equi zooepidemicus can be enhanced significantly in a murine model by induction of specific immunity against the hyaluronan component of this capsule. 96 The two most important underlying components of abscess formation are (1) resistance to phagocytosis and (2) failure of bacterial clearance. Capsules of anaerobic bacteria are unique, and their role in virulence may account directly for the formation of abscesses within the host. The capsule of Bacteroides fragilis has two distinct polysaccharides composed of repeating subunits with oppositely charged groups (zwitterion). 97 This polysaccharide complex injected alone promotes the induction of abscess. Development of antibody against these polysaccharides prevents abscess formation.",

In addition, bacteria possess siderophores, which are potent chelators of iron. 128 These siderophores are secreted outside of the bacterial cell, where they take up iron, and are taken back into the cells through a receptor-mediated process.

Few overt syndromes are recognized in the horse that are caused specifically by S. aureus. However, S. aureus is the most common bacteria isolated from cellulitis and joint infections in adult horses. Cellulitis induced by S. aureus in the horse may be similar to wound-associated toxic shock in human beings. Toxic shock syndrome is a disease of increased capillary permeability characterized by hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The toxins of S. aureus work in concert to (1) induce massive release of cytokines, (2) increase sensitivity to cytokines, and (3) damage endothelial cells directly.

The two main mechanisms for phagosome survival include (1) inhibition of phagolysosomal fusion and (2) blockage of the formation of lysosomal enzymes once phagocytosis occurs. Before escape from the phagosome, Listeria modulates maturation of the phagosome by delaying fusion with the lysosome. 114 One of the earliest observations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in cell culture was uninhibited multiplication within macrophages. 115 Later studies determined that Mycobacterium and Legionella cause a change in the maturation of the phagosome. 116 Once the phagosome is infected, many lysosomal proteins appear in it, yet others do not, indicating a manipulation of the environment after fusion. Engulfment of Salmonella in the phagosome appears to induce formation of an actual phagolysosome, but the organism survives nonetheless. 117 Acidification occurs, but production of reactive oxygen species is decreased. In addition, Salmonella appears resistant to reactive oxygen, which is controlled by a number of oxy genes that are upregulated in response to oxygen stress. This occurs rapidly, within 20 minutes of intracellular uptake of the bacteria. 118 Many bacteria that are resistant to reactive oxygen are able to make catalase and superoxide dismutase.",

Although bacteria use iron for many enzyme systems, the relationship between bacteria produce clinical signs. The active toxin consists of a light and heavy chain (A-B type toxin) that mediates paralysis by blocking acetylcholinesterase in a three-step process. 129,138 The first step is rapid and involves recognition and binding of the neurotoxin to its receptor on the nerve. In the second step, translocation occurs as the active site of the molecule is internalized in the nerve cell ending by endocytosis. The acidified vesicle induces a conformational change in the toxin so that it can be translocated to the cytosol. The third and final step is the slow step in which cell neuroproteins called synaptopeptidases are cleaved, preventing acetylcholine release. The proteins that are cleaved by the neurotoxin include synaptobrevin, synaptosome-associated membrane proteins, and syntaxin. The protein synaptobrevin is a component of the neurotransmitter cell membrane, is essential for neurotransmitter release, and is involved in exocytosis of the neurotransmitter vesicle and axonal growth. Syntaxin is important for vesicle and cell membrane fusion. The inactivation of one or more of these proteins accounts for the prevention of release of synaptic vesicles. The different botulinum neurotoxins exhibit variable specificity to these proteins. Types B, D, F, and G are active against synaptosome-associated membrane proteins, whereas A, C, and E are active against synaptobrevin, and C is the only form that cleaves syntaxin.",

C. perfringens has four major lethal toxins, an enterotoxin, and three minor toxins. Recent genetic evaluation of equine isolates associated with diarrhea indicate the majority of isolates are type A, the toxic affects of which are mediated by \u03b1-toxin. 139 The cpe-toxin or enterotoxin has been detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 16% to 19% of equine isolates, so disease has been linked to enterotoxigenic type A and nonenterotoxigenic type A strains. 18, 140 Individual case reports exist of neonatal diarrhea associated with type B (\u03b2-and \u03b5-toxins), type C (\u03b2-toxin), and type D (\u03b5-toxin) strains, which also carry the \u03b1-toxin. 141, 142 proliferation and induction of type 1 cytokines that stimulate release of proinflammatory cytokines from macrophages. Exfoliative toxin also induces T cell proliferation. TSST-1 and exfoliative toxin of S. aureus enhance the effects of endotoxin in cell culture and live animal experiments. In rabbits the lethal dose of endotoxin is decreased by 100-fold. The TSST-1 binds directly to endothelial cells and in endothelial cell culture demonstrates cytotoxicity. A dose-dependent induction of leakage across monolayers also occurs. Exfoliative toxin and TSST-1 have been identified in equine S. aureus isolates associated with severe phlegmon and metritis. 131, 132 Alpha-toxin has been studied intensely and is directly toxic to many cell types. 129 This toxin can damage erythrocytes, skin, and nerve cells and is lethal. 130 At high concentrations, molecules of the toxin polymerize and form pores in monolayers of cells resulting in permeability of the cells. The arachadonic acid cascade is activated, resulting in thromboxane-and prostacyclin-mediated vasoconstriction in the face of edema formation. Alphatoxin also appears to act directly on platelets, resulting in release of procoagulant factors. Increased permeability and swelling of cells may be important in the pathogenesis of dermal and neural damage. Myelin sheath destruction is the lesion observed in rabbits. The toxin, \u03b2-hemolysin or sphingomyelinase C, is produced in high concentrations in many S. aureus isolates, and the degree of pathogenicity to erythrocytes likely is determined by sphingomyelin content of erythrocytes of different strains and species.

At the cellular level, this toxin can cause platelet aggregation and hemolysis and is cytotoxic and myotoxic. Vascular activity is mediated by upregulation of adhesion molecules in leukocytes and endothelial cells. Endothelial cells and macrophages produce platelet-activating factor in response to toxin exposure. Muscle fibers are damaged by the formation of intravascular aggregates within the muscle. 143 Recent work with \u03b2-toxin and \u03b5-toxin indicates that these toxins act as pore formers. 145,146 Early research into the mechanism of action of \u03b2-toxin indicated a role for catecholamine release because of the sudden increase in heart rate and drop in blood pressure when the toxin was injected into experimental subjects. 138 \u03b2-Toxin polymerizes and forms pores that act as selective ion channels, the generation of which within cell membranes effectively creates a neurotoxin. 145 Work with \u03b5-toxin indicates that this toxin is able to form large pores within membranes, resulting in a flux of potassium outward and chloride and sodium inward. Later ion flux is dominated by movement of calcium into the cell. 146 This flux results in irreversible morphologic changes in the cell membrane and death of the cell.",

New diseases continue to emerge or be discovered; a dramatic example is the Hendra paramyxovirus that appeared in Australia in 1994, killing horses and human beings. 5 More recently, another paramyxovirus, the Salem virus, has been identified in the United States, although the clinical importance of this virus is unclear. 6 Less dramatic but of more relevance to most equine veterinarians is the association of bovine papillomavirus with sarcoids. 7, 8 A number of equine diseases occur in which viral involvement has yet to be excluded, including Theiler's hepatitis 9 and lymphosarcoma. 10 Viral origins also likely will be discovered for diseases in which viruses were not suspected previously to play a role; in human beings and mice, viruses have been proposed to have a role in everything from diabetes to obesity. 11, 12 However, the greatest advances in veterinary virology are in understanding the molecular biology of viral replication, virus-cell interactions, and virus-host interactions. Related advances in molecular biology techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, also are providing sensitive, specific, and rapid tools for the diagnosis of viral infections. In the realm of antiviral drugs, aggressive searches are ongoing for effective and economical drugs for treatment of human beings, and in the near future, antiviral drugs likely will be a realistic therapeutic option for equine veterinarians. 13, 14 Finally, significant advances in the design of vaccines likely will improve the efficacy of immunization.",

For enveloped viruses the receptors are incorporated into the lipid membrane. The primary clinical significance of these features is that enveloped viruses, because of their fragile lipid membrane, are highly susceptible to inactivation by heat, desiccation, or detergents, and transmission typically requires direct exchange of body fluids, short distance aerosols, or arthropod vectors.

The type of viral genome also determines the strategies required to replicate the genome and transcribe messenger RNA (mRNA) (Figure 2.2-3 ). Viral genomes may be singlestranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded DNA, or double-stranded DNA. The genomes of singlestranded RNA viruses may be of \"positive\" polarity in which the genome also serves directly as mRNA for translation of viral proteins. To replicate genomes, these viruses must first synthesize a strand of complementary RNA that can be used as a template to replicate genomes and transcribe new mRNA. Retroviruses are a subset of single-stranded, positive polarity RNA viruses that use their RNA genome as template to produce doublestranded DNA, which in turn is used for the transcription of mRNA and new viral genomes. Single-stranded RNA viruses may also be of \"negative\" polarity in which the genome is antisense to mRNA, and synthesis of a complementary RNA strand is required to serve as mRNA and as template for new genomes. The clinical significance of these types of replication strategies is that they require polymerases and other enzymes not normally found in eukaryotic host cells. Eukaryotic cells, which exclusively use DNA as genetic material and as templates for mRNA transcription, use DNA-dependent DNA polymerases and DNA-dependent RNA polymerases for these functions, respectively. RNA viruses require RNAdependent RNA polymerases to replicate or transcribe RNA, or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) to produce DNA from an RNA template. These unique viral enzymes are important targets for antiviral drugs because they can be used selectively to inhibit viral replication. The most common antiviral drugs currently available are nucleotide analogs that are used selectively by viral but not cellular enzymes and result in defective DNA or RNA. 17, 18 Although most DNA viruses follow the eukaryotic pattern of replication and transcription, in many cases these viruses produce homologs of host cell enzymes that are sufficiently unique to make them selectively susceptible to nucleotide analogs. Additional targets for current and future antiviral agents are viral proteins used for translation and posttranslational protein processing. 17 Viral polymerases and the genetic organization of viruses are also important for rapid antigenic variation and immunologic evasion. Viral RNA polymerases are low fidelity and lack proofreading functions and thus randomly will introduce errors into new RNA at an average rate of about one nucleotide mismatch per 10,000 bases copied. 19 Therefore in a population of viruses, virtually every individual virus differs slightly, and this population is referred to as a quasi-species. Although many of these mutations are neutral or even deleterious, in the face of selective pressures such as the host immune responses or antiviral drugs, this genetic plasticity allows rapid development of resistant virus populations. 20 Secondary structures or certain sequences in the viral genome may facilitate polymerase errors further at selected regions that are important for immune evasion, such as in sequences that code for neutralizing epitopes. 19 The genomes of some viruses, such as influenza, are comprised of separate segments, which allows reassortment of entire gene segments and sudden and dramatic changes in antigenicity. 21 ",

            "text": "One of the most critical virus-cell interactions is attachment and entry. This initial step is one of the most important determinants of species susceptibility, host cell tropism, and is an important target for antiviral antibodies that neutralize infectivity. Attachment and entry requires a specific interaction between a viral receptor and a cellsurface protein that acts as the host cell receptor. Many viruses also require interaction with additional cell surface molecules (co-receptors) for successful attachment and entry. Influenza provides a good example of this process. The influenza virus hemagglutinin molecule binds to sialic acid residues of cell-surface glycolipids or glycoproteins. Binding induces a conformational change in the hemagglutinin protein, exposing a cleavage site to a host cell protease. Cleavage of hemagglutinin induces fusion of the viral envelope to the host cell membrane and release of the capsid into the cytosol. 22, 23 Equine influenza does not infect human beings because the hemagglutinin molecules do not recognize human sialic acid molecules. 24 Within the horse, equine influenza infection is restricted to respiratory epithelial cells by the distribution of the appropriate host cell protease. 22 Viruses may infect other cell types by using a different host cell receptor for attachment and entry. Highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza are able to spread systemically because of mutations in the hemagglutinin that allow cleavage by host cell proteases found on cells outside of the respiratory tract. 22 Other ways in which a virus can infect multiple cell types are using a host cell receptor that is present on different cell types or infecting a single cell type that is present in different tissues (e.g., macrophages and vascular endothelium). Host cell receptors also may be present in an age-dependent fashion, accounting for age-related differences in susceptibility to diseases such as polioencephalomyelitis and rotaviral enteritis. 25, 26 Once the viral nucleocapsid gains entry to the cytosol of the cell, the viral genome is released through the process of uncoating. After uncoating, depending on the genetic composition of the virus, the viral genome localizes to the appropriate regions of the cell for replication and mRNA transcription. DNA viruses typically replicate genomes and transcribe mRNA in the nucleus and then transport the mRNA to the cytoplasm for translation. RNA viruses typically replicate, transcribe mRNA, and translate viral proteins in the cytoplasm. These sites of replication account, respectively, for the location of viral inclusion bodies that are diagnostically useful in histopathologic sections. In general, the first viral proteins expressed are regulatory factors, enzymes, and polymerases required for initiation of viral gene expression and diversion of host cell resources to viral replication. Subsequently, viral structural proteins are expressed and assembled with new viral genomes into virions. Enveloped viruses require the additional step of acquiring a lipid envelope by budding the nucleocapsid through areas of the nuclear or plasma membrane into which viral proteins have been incorporated. Viruses then are released, usually in association with death of the host cell, into the extracellular space and blood. Some viruses such as herpesviruses and paramyxoviruses also may transfer progeny virions directly into an adjacent cell by inducing fusion between the two cells, a strategy that allows the virus to avoid contact with neutralizing antibodies in the extracellular space.",

However, many cells infected by viruses already are differentiated fully and in the resting phase (G 0 or G 1 phase). Some of the more complex viruses, such as herpesviruses, poxviruses, and adenoviruses, have virally encoded proteins that activate the cellular systems for growth and division, thus manipulating the cell to create an environment favorable for viral replication. This ability allows tropism for cells that otherwise might not be able to support viral replication. The \"immediate early\" genes expressed by herpesviruses, which initiate viral replication in differentiated cells, induce progression of the cell cycle from G 0 to the S phase. 27, 28 Other viruses, particularly the genetically simpler viruses such as parvoviruses, lack the ability to activate resting cells. 27, 29 Thus their tropism is restricted to cells that naturally go through a growth and division phase, such as intestinal crypt cells and hematopoietic cells. Consequently, parvoviral diseases such as feline panleukopenia typically involve replication in the rapidly dividing cells of the intestine (diarrhea) and bone marrow (pancytopenias). If infection occurs in utero during development of tissues such as the cerebellum, neurologic disease also may be observed.",

However, these types of diseases may be identified in the future. Viral proteins that activate the cell cycle into the growth and division phases may lead to neoplastic transformation if expressed in a cell that is not killed by the infection. Papillomavirus infections induce epithelial neoplasms (fibropapillomata) using a virally encoded protein (E5 oncoprotein) that induces proliferation of normally quiescent cells and that presumably is needed for viral replication. 8 The E1A oncoproteins and immediate early proteins of adenoviruses and herpesviruses, respectively, are highly oncogenic in cells that do not allow full virus expression. 32, 33 Adenoviral and herpesviral infections in horses currently are not recognized as oncogenic. The lack of oncogenic transformation by these viruses is most likely because abortive infections may not occur in vivo, transformed cells are always removed by the immune system, or the requisite co-factors for transformation are not present. As an example of the role of co-factors, infection of human beings with human herpesvirus 4 (Epstein-Barr virus, the cause of infectious mononucleosis) is not associated commonly with neoplasia in North America or Europe, whereas infection with this virus in Africa is associated strongly with Burkitt's lymphoma and in China with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 34 Oncogenic retroviruses, including leukemia and sarcoma viruses, induce neoplastic transformation in several ways but in all cases do so by integration into the host cell genome and activation of cellular oncogenes. 35 Specifically, a retrovirus and its viral promoter sequences may insert upstream from and activate a normally quiescent cellular oncogene in the process of viral gene expression. Other retroviruses, such as the bovine leukemia virus, produce a virally encoded protein, tax, that transactivates and upregulates the expression of cellular oncogenes. These are believed to be the primary mechanisms of transformation by the leukemia viruses. Integration of the retroviral genome also may inactivate by insertion host cell repressors required to actively suppress the expression of cellular oncogenes. Some retroviral genomes, such as those of the rapidly transforming sarcoma viruses, may transform the cell by acquiring cellular oncogenes that are then co-expressed along with other viral gene products during replication.",

Secreted interferons similarly impart resistance to viral replication in adjacent cells, and are an important mechanism for controlling the local spread of infection. Some viruses, including paramyxoviruses, adenoviruses, and herpesviruses, produce proteins that interfere with the cell signaling mechanisms required for the expression of interferon-induced proteins. 36, 37 One of the most important systems for recognition of virally infected cells by cytotoxic lymphocytes is endocytic processing of viral proteins followed by expression of the resultant viral peptides on the cell surface complexed with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Viral products may interfere directly with the processing, transport, or cell surface expression of MHC I molecules or viral peptides, thereby preventing recognition by cytotoxic, CD8 + T lymphocytes. 36, 38 In antigenpresenting cells, cell surface expression of viral peptides with MHC II molecules to immune regulatory cells, mainly CD4 + helper T lymphocytes and B cells, is required for initiation and upregulation of antibody and cellmediated antiviral immune responses. Similar interference with the processing, transport, or cell surface expression of MHC II molecules or viral peptides can interfere with antiviral immune responses. 36 In addition, some herpesviruses also have been shown to interfere with recognition of virally infected cells by natural killer cells, an early, nonspecific cell-mediated immune response. 39 An interesting and more recently recognized viral mechanism for interference with host immune responses is the use of virally encoded cytokine mimics. Cytokines are critical cell signaling molecules that coordinate and regulate the development of host immune responses. Some viruses, including poxviruses, herpesviruses, and adenoviruses, express cytokine homologs that mimic and interfere with the activity of interferons, interleukin-1, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor, epidermal growth factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. 36, 40 Although the role of these homologs in natural disease is not clear, experimentally they can modulate immune responses and affect disease severity. 36",

Although many host factors may influence the severity of clinical disease, virulence per se is strictly a property of the virus. The main properties of a virus that may affect virulence include host cell tropism and replication rate. A tropism change that leads to involvement of additional tissues or facilitates virus spread generally results in more severe disease. The systemic spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza strains described earlier is one example. Outbreaks of EHV1 abortion or neurologic disease strongly suggest that EHV1 strains exist that have a tropism for these tissues compared with EHV1 strains that cause respiratory disease. However, the appropriate studies have not been performed yet to determine the exact basis for this observation. Limited studies of EHV1 genetics and virulence in mouse models have not identified differences between the abortigenic, neurogenic, and respiratory strains. 46 However, the severity of EHV1 respiratory disease in experimentally infected foals can be decreased by deletion of genes that facilitate cell-to-cell spread. 47 An increase in the viral replication rate usually is associated with an increase in virulence, presumably because of the greater number of infected cells and amount of tissue damage. The virulence of equine infectious anemia virus strains can be correlated directly to plasma virus titers and numbers of infected cells, without any changes in tropism. 48, 49 The molecular basis for the increased replication rate is not clear but most likely is caused by variation in viral regulatory sequences and proteins. 50, 51 ",

            "text": "Viral infections generally are regarded as localized or systemic. Localized viral infections are those that are restricted to a single organ system, often at the site of entry. Because infection of the tissue is direct, the incubation period for localized viral infections is usually short, often only a few days. Many infections of the skin or mucosal surfaces are localized, and examples in the horse include infections with enteric rotavirus and influenza. For influenza, virus is inhaled into the nasopharynx and replicates in epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and trachea. Virus is not present in the blood or tissues outside of the respiratory tract. In general, viruses remain localized because they lack the receptors to infect cells of other tissues or circulating cells such as monocytes or lymphocytes that can disseminate the virus. Some viruses are temperature sensitive and remain localized because they are unable to replicate efficiently at core body temperatures. EHV3, the cause of coital exanthema, is restricted to the surface of the genitalia in horses because of its temperature sensitivity. 52 EHV1 and EHV4 are not temperature sensitive, however, and systemic infection may occur with these viruses. The feline respiratory herpesvirus is also temperature sensitive and normally is restricted to the cooler mucosal surfaces. However, hypothermia may lead to dissemination and multiorgan infections. 53 Temperature sensitivity is also a means by which some viruses, such as equine influenza and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, may be attenuated for use as modified-live intranasal vaccines. Infection by the vaccine strain is limited to the cooler mucosal surfaces; the inability to spread systemically prevents sequelae such as abortion and pneumonia. 54, 55 Systemic infections are those in which virus is disseminated to multiple tissues by blood or lymph. This viremia may exist in the form of cell-free virions in the plasma or lymph or may be cell-associated in circulating blood cells, usually monocytes or lymphocytes. The classic paradigm for a systemic infection is infection of mice with ectromelia virus 56 (Figure 2.2-5) . Localized viral replication first occurs at the site of entry and in regional lymph nodes. Depending on the level of replication, clinical disease may be present. The virus then enters the blood or lymphatics and spreads to other tissues such as spleen and liver, in which clinical disease may occur. Virus is amplified and then released again for a second, usually higher-titered, viremia that further disseminates the virus to other organs. Each viremic episode is associated with a febrile response and is the basis for the biphasic fever response associated with some viral infections. Because systemic infections require multiple steps, the incubation periods are longer than for localized infections, typically 1 to several weeks. Infections in the horse by eastern, western, or Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus closely follow this paradigm. Localized viral replication occurs at the site of entry (mosquito bite) followed by viremia and dissemination to the central nervous system. 57 For most horses, even nonvaccinated horses, dissemination is controlled before infection of the brain, and neurologic disease is a rare outcome of infection. A variation on the theme is infection of horses with EHV1. The most common clinical disease associated with EHV1 infection is rhinopneumonitis caused by a localized infection of the nasopharyngeal mucosa. 58 In almost all cases a cell-associated viremia also occurs in lymphocytes, but in most infected horses this does not result in disease. However, in some cases, viremia is associated with infection of endothelial cells, and in the pregnant mare vascular damage to the uterus and placenta may lead to abortion. 58, 59 Similarly, infection of the vascular endothelium in the central nervous system results in neurologic disease. 60 Some viruses also may spread in the host through nerves. In the horse, rabies is the best known infection that relies on neural spread. Following local replication in myocytes at the site of entry, usually a bite wound, rabies virus ascends peripheral nerves into the central nervous system, where it replicates in neurons, and then egresses by way of cranial nerves to the salivary gland. 61 EHV1 and EHV4 establish latency in the nuclei of sensory neurons that innervate the nasopharynx and reach the nucleus by ascending nerve axons. Similarly, on reactivation, these viruses egress back down the axon to infect epithelial cells. 43, 62 ",

Viral infections of organ systems with bacterial flora (e.g., intestinal and respiratory tracts) can disrupt the normal barrier functions of these organs and result in secondary bacterial infections and toxemia that may contribute significantly to the pathologic response.

If the number of infected cells is not sufficient to lead to clinically significant organ dysfunction, then the result is a subclinical infection. Vaccination and naturally acquired immunity are important factors that limit the number of infected cells. However, epidemiologically these infections may still be important because these animals may still be infectious. When enough cells are infected to lead to overt organ dysfunction, then clinical disease becomes apparent. The threshold for clinically significant damage varies considerably between organs and the types of cells. EHV1 infections of the respiratory epithelium, which has a large number of cells with a high turnover rate, produce mild clinical disease even with a high rate of infection. On the other hand, much more significant clinical manifestations of EHV1 infection such as abortion and neurologic disease are caused by infection of a few endothelial cells because minimal vascular damage can lead to thrombosis, ischemic necrosis, and damage to large amounts of tissue. If viral infection results in neoplastic transformation of a cell type, then disease may progress according to the characteristics of the neoplasm, whether or not the virus remains associated with the tumor. Of particular importance are infections of the respiratory and intestinal tracts that contain normal bacterial flora and have important barrier functions to prevent access of bacteria and toxins to deeper tissues. Consequently, complications of bacterial infection and toxemia are important secondary problems of viral infections. 63, 64 For example, upper respiratory viral infections damage the ciliated epithelial cells that function to move mucus and other respiratory secretions outward and provide a barrier between the mucosal bacterial flora and the underlying subepithelial tissues. Damage to this barrier may lead to opportunistic bacterial pneumonias by normal bacterial flora such as Streptococcus equi zooepidemicus or Mannheimia haemolytica in horses or cattle, respectively.",

Antibodies bound to soluble viral antigens fix complement and opsonize neutrophils, again leading to indiscriminate cell and tissue destruction. Viral antigens may be on the surface of cells, such as erythrocytes or platelets, resulting in immune-mediated anemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. 66 When viral antigen is in excess relative to antibody, circulating immune complexes are formed that can be deposited in the capillary beds of tissues such as joints and renal glomeruli. In chronic equine infectious anemia virus, with persistent viral replication and antigenemia in the presence of antiviral antibodies, these mechanisms are primarily responsible for the characteristic lesions of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and glomerulonephritis. 66,67 Nonneutralizing antiviral antibodies actually may serve to increase the number of infected cells and the severity of disease through the mechanism of antibody-dependent enhancement. This enhancement occurs when antibodies bind to the virus and facilitate attachment and entry into Fc receptorbearing cells such as macrophages by serving as a form of alternative receptor. 68 Antibody-dependent enhancement has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, including feline infectious peritonitis, 69 human respiratory syncytial virus, 70 and dengue hemorrhagic fever. 71 Soluble inflammatory mediators released by infected cells and inflammatory cells in response to viral infections are also significant contributors to clinical signs and disease manifestation. These mediators include a wide array of cytokines, interleukins, and other proinflammatory molecules with potent systemic and local effects. The most evident of these is the febrile response caused by interleukin-1 released by macrophages in response to virally infected cells. Increased levels of other soluble factors, including interferons, interleukins, transforming growth factor, and tumor necrosis factor are also present in many viral infections. 72, 73 These cytokines are primarily proinflammatory and immunoregulatory and are generally important for the control of viral infections but also can be responsible for many of the nonspecific clinical signs of viral infection such as depression, malaise, and in chronic infections, cachexia. Soluble mediators also may have important local effects. Vasoactive factors such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes cause edema and swelling. In equine infectious anemia virus, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, transforming growth factor \u03b2, and interferon-\u03b1 have been shown to suppress hematopoiesis and contribute to the development of anemia and thrombocytopenia. 74",

One of the most important obstacles to persistence and transmission is detection and elimination by the host immune system. Transmission to a new host also may require that the virus avoid preexisting immunity from prior natural exposures or vaccination. Within the host, rapidly replicating viruses such as influenza may shed and transmit virus before the host can mount specific antiviral immune responses. Herpesviruses avoid detection during latency by not expressing any viral proteins. For persistent viral infections that continually replicate within a host, such as retroviruses, evasion of developing immune responses is necessary. Immunodeficiency viruses may cripple antiviral immune responses by directly infecting immunoregulatory CD4 + T lymphocytes. As described previously, many other viruses can dysregulate host immune responses by expressing cytokine mimics.",

The most important of these antigens includes viral proteins bound by neutralizing antibodies (e.g., virus receptors) and any peptides presented in the context of MHC I or II cell surface molecules for recognition by cytotoxic (CD8 + ) T lymphocytes or helper (CD4 + ) T lymphocytes, respectively. Antigenic variation is generated by nucleotide errors during transcription or replication, which result in amino acid substitutions in the relevant epitopes. This process is facilitated by viral polymerases that are inherently errorprone and lack proofreading functions and by placing the sequences for the relevant epitopes adjacent to other genomic sequences or structures that further predispose to transcriptional errors. 19 Other mechanisms by which some viruses may modify their antigenicity is through intramolecular recombination/duplication or reassortment of segmented genomes (e.g., influenza and African horse sickness). 19, 21 For reassortment, co-infection of a single cell with genetically different virions may result in a progeny virion with segments derived from both virions and a major change in antigenicity. In influenza these are called antigenic shifts, and the radical change in the antigenicity of the virus may render preexisting immunity in the host population ineffective at preventing outbreaks of disease with high morbidity and mortality. 21 Viruses also may facilitate the production of nonneutralizing antibodies that sterically interfere with the ability of neutralizing antibodies to bind. Although the mechanism of antigenic variation is primarily random, immunologic selection determines which variants successfully emerge and are capable of replicating within the host or the host population.",

The sensitivity and specificity of antibody testing has been enhanced by the recombinant viral proteins or peptides for use as antigens in serologic tests.

The clinical utility of traditional methods of virus isolation in cell culture often is limited by the sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, or the length of time needed to perform this type of assay. Another significant limitation of virus isolation, particularly for the more labile enveloped viruses, is the requirement for viable virus, which may be compromised by autolysis or transport to the laboratory. In many diagnostic laboratories, virus isolation in cell culture has been replaced by immunohistochemistry and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), both of which are sensitive and specific tests that can be completed within a day or two. Immunohistochemistry is a method that detects viral antigens in formalin-fixed tissue samples. Although immunohistochemistry technology has been available for many years, this assay has become more widely used because of improvements in the methods for antigen retrieval and the greater availability of antiviral monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The aldehydes in formalin cross-link proteins during the fixation process and prevent the recognition of epitopes by antibodies. For many viruses, reliable protocols now have been established that use carefully controlled protease digestion of the tissue sections so that the availability of epitopes is restored. 86 The tissue sections then can be incubated with antiviral antibodies, and bound antibodies can be visualized with a variety of colorimetric systems (Figure 2.2-6 ). The specificity of immunohistochemistry depends highly on the antiviral antiserum and has been improved greatly by the availability of antiviral monoclonal antibodies and recombinant viral proteins that can be used to generate monospecific antisera. [87] [88] [89] The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is a nucleic acid amplification method that detects viral DNA or RNA extracted from fresh or formalin-fixed tissue samples. Only a few years ago the techniques used to purify nucleic acids and perform the PCR reaction were limited by expense and practicality to the research laboratory. However, the simplification and commercialization of these procedures has made this type of test economical and clinically useful for diagnostic laboratories. 90, 91 The PCR test uses oligonucleotide primers and a thermostable DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) to amplify exponentially the viral nucleic acids. The basis for specific amplification in the PCR assay is the sequence of the oligonucleotide primers, which are produced synthetically to be complementary and thus bind to the viral nucleic acid sequences. To produce complementary primers, the sequence of the viral DNA or RNA must be known. Consequently, this assay is only useful for testing for viruses that have been sequenced, and in the past, sequence data limited the ability to design PCR primers. However, because of advances in the technology for sequencing and database management, virtually all of the significant equine pathogens now have complete sequence data available. At the end of the PCR procedure, the amplified nucleic acids, that is, a positive result, are visualized most commonly with agarose gel electrophoresis in which the amplicons in the gel are viewed with a fluorescent dye, and the product presumptively is confirmed as the correct one based on its molecular size (Figure 2.2-7) .",

The degree of alteration depends on the existing physiologic condition of the animal, which is dictated to a great degree by its age, nutritional status, and previous immunologic experience with the parasite. The numbers of parasites introduced and the specific parasite also affect the degree of physiologic change that occurs. When these factors favor major alterations, the results are readily identifiable clinical signs of infection. Subclinical infections, although less apparent, are potentially important to the general health of the animal and continued transmission of the agent. The pathophysiologic effects of infection by ectoparasites, helminths, and microorganisms are in many cases similar. Abnormalities in weight gain, skeletal growth, reproduction, and lactation may result from infections with any of these agents. These changes often are related directly to parasite-induced anorexia, disruption of metabolic processes, and anemia. An understanding of the morphologic and biochemical lesions produced by specific parasites clarifies the role of these agents in clinical and subclinical conditions associated with the infections. A majority of detailed studies on the pathophysiology of parasitic infections have been conducted in laboratory animal models and domestic animal species other than the horse. 2 However, the classical pathologic effect of parasitic infections of the horse has been reviewed. 3, 4 The following discussion outlines some recent observations on host-parasite interactions that may be significant to equine medicine.

Details of the pathogenesis of colic associated with migration of S. vulgaris through the mesenteric arteries and the resultant thrombosis, infarctions, and necrosis of the intestine have been described in detail elsewhere. 3, 4 Although this condition has been well described, some points are particularly noteworthy. Histologic studies of experimentally infected parasite-free pony foals during the initial stages of the infection indicate that the severity of the lesions produced in the intestine cannot be attributed solely to mechanical disruption caused by larval migrations and that these larval stages induce some biologic amplification system within the mucosa, which results in the degree of inflammation observed. 5 Although the mechanisms involved in this response have not been investigated, the histologic nature of the lesion is characteristic of an Arthus reaction, suggesting an involvement of the immune response. Other experimental studies using the parasite-free pony-S. vulgaris system have implicated the immune response in the mediation and regulation of the arterial lesions produced by this parasite. Passive transfer of immune serum, but not normal serum, reduced the severity of arteritis and clinical signs associated with experimental infections without reducing the numbers of parasites that developed in these ponies. However, treatment with immune serum also induced an anamnestic eosinophilia and significant perivascular infiltration of eosinophils in the cecum. The reduction in intravascular lesions may have been associated with an inactivation of parasite-secreted inflammatory factors by antibody or serum enzymes. This serum also may have contained nonspecific host-derived antiinflammatory substances. The exacerbation of the eosinophil response may have been associated with the formation of immune complexes.",

Larvicidal treatment of S. vulgaris-infected horses and killing of intravascular larvae has been postulated to release a bolus of antigenic factors from these larvae within the mesenteric vasculature, resulting in an exacerbation of arterial and intestinal lesions and colic. Experimental testing of this hypothesis indicates that this phenomenon does not occur and further that viable larvae are necessary to maintain the arteritis and eosinophilia seen. 6,7 P. equorum-associated colic in foals has been related to intestinal impaction and rupture and is not considered to be of major significance in adult horses. 8 However, ascarid nematodes are particularly potent sources of allergens, and conceivably the hypersensitized mature horse may respond to low-level infections by this parasite. Observations made in the author's laboratory are noteworthy in this regard. Two mature Parascaris-free adult horses were inoculated intradermally with less than 90 \u00b5g of saline-soluble somatic extract of adult P. equorum to test for immediate hypersensitivity to this antigen. Both horses experienced an immediate systemic response and colic. One of the horses died within 3 hours of intradermal inoculation. Necropsy results were consistent with the diagnosis of colitis X. Because of the allergic potential of ascarid nematodes and the sensitivity of the equine gut to immediate hypersensitivity reactions, this potential is worthy of further characterization and consideration.",

Case reports have described cecal ruptures and intussusceptions of the cecum and colon associated with these infections. 9,10 However, detailed retrospective analysis of the concomitant occurrence of intussusception and colic and A. perfoliata infections has failed to demonstrate any causal relationship between these conditions and tapeworm infections. 11 These parasites inhabit the region of the ileocecal junction and produce ulcerated lesions of the mucosa and submucosal inflammation. However, the parasites are common, and possibly the association of tapeworm infections and clinical signs attributed to them are caused by chance alone. Detailed experimental investigations of these infections have not been conducted, and thus specific details on the pathogenesis and relevance of these lesions are lacking. However, an association between tapeworm infections and colic of ileocecal origin has been suggested in a case-control study of 231 horses. 12 Until recently, cyathostomes (small strongyles) have not been considered of major importance, particularly as causative agents of colic. In this regard the field studies of Uhlinger are of particular importance. 13 In these controlled experiments, different anthelmintic treatment regimens were used to test their efficacy in reducing the incidence of colic. The more efficacious treatment programs significantly reduced the incidence of colic by 2 to 13 times that seen in the same herds before implementation of the more efficacious treatment. Because of the management programs used before the initiation of this study and the results of fecal cultures, one can assume that the primary parasites present in these horses were cyathostomes. These data strongly implicate a role for cyathostomes in a substantial proportion of colics observed under field conditions. The parasite or host factors involved in these colic cases are unknown.",

The condition is difficult to diagnose, and the only consistent signs are weight loss and diarrhea. 14 Large numbers of larval cyathostomes are found in the feces or in intestinal contents and within the mucosa of these horses. These symptoms are related to the synchronous emergence of fourth-stage larvae of these parasites from the mucosa. These larvae build to potentially large numbers within the mucosa because of the arrested development of infective larvae. The seasonality of the occurrence of this condition at present does not appear to vary in different climatic regions as does the analogous bovine condition of type II ostertagiasis.

            "text": "In view of the paucity of specific mechanistic information on the pathophysiologic effects of equine gastrointestinal parasites, a synopsis of relevant information gathered from other model systems is warranted. 2, 15 Parasitic organisms may induce changes in gastrointestinal function directly by mechanical disruption of tissues and cells or by the release of factors that directly alter cell function. Induction of the immune response serves as an anamnestic amplification system. The result of these changes is an alteration in function of the smooth muscle and epithelium of the bowel. A number of helminth parasites, including P. equorum, have been demonstrated to produce intestinal smooth muscle hyperplasia. Evidence suggests that this response may be induced by intestinal inflammation or stenosis associated with parasitism. Contractility of these muscles also has been demonstrated to be induced in a Schultz-Dale reaction by stimulation with parasite antigens. This response is mediated in rats by mast-cell-derived 5-hydroxytryptamine and in guinea pigs by histamine. A regulatory relationship of myenteric neurons to these antigen-induced changes also has been demonstrated in this model system. These latter experiments suggest that antigen-induced stimulation of smooth muscle contractility may be blocked correspondingly by \u03b3-aminobutyric acid similarly stimulated by mast cell products. This complex system may be an adaptation by the host to maintain homeostasis in the face of continued antigenic stimulus. What is noteworthy is that strongyleinduced alterations in myoelectric activity of the equine small intestine and colon have been demonstrated in vivo. 16, 17 In some of these experiments, dead S. vulgaris larvae evoked an alteration of the smooth muscle response in previously exposed ponies, suggesting a role for the immune response in the stimulation of the hyperactivity. 18 A recent series of in vitro and in vivo experiments on the direct interaction of factors produced by the adult heartworm Dirofilaria immitis and arterial endothelium are exciting and noteworthy. 19 The results of these studies indicate that endothelial cell-mediated vasodilation is depressed in the presence of small (100 to 1000 molecular weight) parasite-derived pharmacologically active substances. Seasonal pathologic changes in infected arteries in dogs have been associated with the release of these substances by adult parasites. The nature of the factor or factors involved is unknown at this time. Production of similar factors in the mucosa or mucosal vasculature by nematodes could induce focal alteration in blood flow and other physiologic effects on smooth muscle. In general, these studies demonstrate the potential variety and complexity of metazoan-host interactions that have yet to be defined.",

Hypersensitivity responses are linked to functional changes in epithelium, such as decreases in epithelial brush border digested enzyme activity, decreased absorption, reduction in fluid absorption, and an increase in fluid secretion. 2 In vitro studies on the Clsecretion of isolated intestines from guinea pigs and rats infected with the nematode Trichinella spiralis have proved to correlate with in vivo fluid secretion. 15 In this system, antigenic stimulation induces an increase in Clsecretion similar to that induced by cholera toxin. The mechanism of this phenomenon in rats is mediated by antiparasite immunoglobulin E-mast cell release of at least two pharmacologically active substances that function in two phases. The immediate response depends on T cell-mediated mast cell hyperplasia, which is important in the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine and histamine. These factors act on enteric neurons to induce the immediate increases in Clsecretion from epithelial cells. The second phase is independent of mast cell hyperplasia and is mediated through 5-hydroxytryptamine and histamine-initiated increase in de novo mucosal synthesis of prostaglandin, which mediates a second phase of secretion. These in vitro phenomena can be blocked at various stages by extrinsically supplied pharmacologic agents. The suggestion is that similar levels of control may be active in vivo, mediating these effects and maintaining homeostasis in most cases.

Focal, alopecic, depigmented, pruritic lesions often are seen in infected horses. Not all infected horses react to this infection, and the appearance of clinical signs is often seasonal. Detailed studies have not been conducted on the pathogenesis of these lesions in horses. However, similar conditions occur in human onchocerciasis, 20 and the host-parasite responses active in human beings likely are also present in the horse. Lesion development is associated with immune-mediated killing of microfilariae in the skin. Parasites appear to be killed in an antibody-dependent cell-mediated reaction. In this response, antimicrofilarial surface immunoglobulin G and E antibodies mediate adherence and degranulation of granulocytes, which are predominantly eosinophils. The major basic protein of eosinophils has been demonstrated in the tissues of patients with dermal lesions, and eosinophil toxic enzymes and proteins are responsible for many of the changes seen. The reason for the absence of these lesions in most horses is unclear. Human onchocerciasis and filariasis are spectral diseases in which regulation of immune responses has been associated with the lack of pathologic responses to the parasites. 21 Immune regulatory mechanisms associated with these infections include immune tolerance, anergy, induction of immune regulatory circuits involving suppressor T cells or macrophages, and most recently the potential shift in T helper cell subsets, which potentially alters the production of specific cytokines during different phases of the infections. The parasites themselves also may play a role in these regulatory responses. High-molecularweight proteins and phosphorylcholine-containing proteins isolated from filariae have been demonstrated to suppress lymphoproliferation in vitro. 22 Although the activity of these proteins is yet to be demonstrated in vivo, chemotherapeutic elimination of circulating microfilaria from infected individuals restores previously suppressed parasite-specific lymphocyte responses. The presence of these types of parasite-associated immune regulatory events has yet to be studied critically in the horse. However, the seasonal variability in skin responses to the Onchocerca microfilariae by horses in some regions has been investigated. In this instance, the onset of ventral-midline dermatitis during the summer may be related to a seasonal fluctuation in microfilarial burdens of the skin, which also peak at this time. 23 Not only do total numbers increase, but also the microfilariae are found more commonly in the surface layers of the skin. Interestingly, this period of abundant microfilariae corresponds with the seasonal peak in numbers of the vector Culicoides varripennis. Although speculative, correlations in the peak availability of microfilariae and vectors may be an evolutionary adaptation by these parasites to maximize transmission and survival of this parasite species.",

Although not studied in horses, similar phenomena occur in swine strongyloidosis. In these infections, an apparent protective resistance against the migrating stage L 3 parasite occurs that is effective in preventing reestablishment of the intestinal infection but is ineffective against L 3 parasites, which are sequestered in the abdominal fat of the sow. 25 Similar epidemiologic phenomena occur in S. westeri infections of horses implying that similar immunologic mechanisms are also active.",

            "text": "Immune responses directed toward gastrointestinal nematodes vary significantly among hosts and against different parasite species within a given host. 22 However, some generalities may be stated that may serve as a background for understanding these responses in the horse. A phenomenon termed self-cure has been described in sheep, in which the ingestion of significant numbers of infective larvae induces the expulsion of existing adult parasites. This expulsion is initiated by a species-specific immediate-type hypersensitivity response that may cause the nonspecific expulsion of other nematode species. Although this phenomenon has not been examined in the equine, experimental infections of naturally parasitized ponies with large numbers of S. vulgaris L 3 induced a dramatic decrease in preexisting strongyle fecal egg counts, suggesting that a self-cure-like reaction may occur under some conditions. More typically, establishment of primary infections results at some time in spontaneous expulsions of these worms because of senility or, as demonstrated in laboratory animal model systems, active acquired immune responses. This phenomenon occurs experimentally in the absence of reinfection and is thus separate from the self-cure phenomenon. A confusing number of immune effectors have been identified with this phenomenon in various model systems, and likely some if not all are at some time active in the equine intestine. The mechanisms involved are T cell dependent. Antibodies may be involved but are not sufficient in themselves to induce expulsion. T cell-mediated mastocytosis, eosinophilia, and goblet cell hyperplasia have been demonstrated to be related to expression of expulsion in some systems. These accessory cells are involved in the nonspecific efferent arm of this response. Mediators of inflammation, such as vasoactive amines, prostaglandins, and increased mucus production, have been linked to immune elimination of primary infections in some but not all model systems. A number of specific immunologic events likely initiate several nonspecific effector mechanisms, resulting in this expulsion. These mechanisms vary with the species of parasite involved. The elimination of adult S. westeri and P. equorum from maturing horses and the hypothetical seasonal turnover in Strongylus spp. and cyathostome species may be mediated by such responses.",

This reaction, termed rapid expulsion or immune exclusion, is separate from self-cure or immune expulsion of primary infection. Infective larvae are expelled from the intestine in a matter of hours. Again mechanisms of expulsion described vary between parasite and host species. However, anaphylactic reactions and mucus entrapment have been observed. Some experiments using the Trichinella spiralis-rat system suggest that alterations in the epithelial cells in immune animals are involved directly in the exclusion of these parasites. Although immune-mediated damage of intestinal helminths such as decreased fecundity, reduced size, and morphologic alterations have been noted, infective larvae expelled by rapid expulsion mechanisms remain viable and undamaged.

These include parasites such as P. equorum, Strongyloides westeri, and Strongylus spp., all of which stimulate an acquired immune response in the horse. During this migration, larvae are vulnerable to attack by immune effectors that may encapsulate them in an immune-mediated inflammatory response, disrupt their migrations by interfering with important metabolic or invasive processes, or inhibit molting from the L 3 to L 4 stages. The most studied phenomenon in this regard is antibody-mediated adherence of inflammatory cells, which may result in killing of the larvae. This phenomenon has been demonstrated to involve many cell types and immunoglobulin isotypes in different host-parasite systems. In vitro studies of this nature have been conducted using S. vulgaris third-stage larvae and equine immune effectors in the author's laboratory. In these experiments, an antibody-dependent adherence of cells was demonstrated and shown to be parasite species-specific. In vitro killing was mediated by eosinophils and not by neutrophils or monocytes. Activated eosinophils were necessary to mediate this response, and S. vulgaris infections have been demonstrated to activate eosinophils and neutrophils in vivo. 26 Although eosinophils are not known with certainty to be essential in this protective immune response, an anamnestic eosinophilia is characteristic in immune ponies but not nonimmune ponies following experimental S. vulgaris challenge. Because of its prominence and compelling in vitro and correlative in vivo data, the eosinophil has been considered to be a major effector in immune-mediated helminth killing. However, recent studies in murine parasite model systems in which eosinophilia was blocked by anti-interleukin-5 treatment suggest that this type of cell is not essential for protective resistance in some systems. 27 Possibly, in vivo a number of cells function as effectors and may overcome the absence of sufficient eosinophils under some circumstances. Antibody reactivity with parasite-secreted enzymes and molting fluids, factors important in parasite homeostasis, have been demonstrated in vitro; and similar reactions may be important in vivo.",

            "text": "The family Anaplasmataceae is included in the order Rickettsiales along with the family Rickettsiaceae. 4 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence comparison currently is considered to be the most reliable method to determine phylogenetic relatedness among bacteria. Studies have shown relatedness (81.7%) in the sequences of the 16S rRNA gene in N. risticii and Rickettsia prowazekii, which is the causative agent of epidemic typhus, a well-known rickettsial disease responsible for the deaths of millions of persons during wartime and natural disasters. The percentage of 16S rRNA gene sequence homology between N. risticii and N. sennetsu is 98.9%, and the next related bacterium is N. helminthoeca (94.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence homology). 12 N. helminthoeca is the causative agent of salmon poisoning disease of the dog. N. helminthoeca is transmitted by trematodes, is antigenically cross-reactive with N. risticii, and biologically and morphologically resembles N. risticii. 13 Furthermore, the 16S rRNA gene of the trematode Stellantchasmus falcatus (SF agent) is 99.1% homologous to that of N. risticii. 14 Within 11 N. risticii strains, a maximum of 10 nucleotides are different (0.7% divergence). 15 N. risticii is genetically divergent from Anaplasma phagocytophilum (formerly Ehrlichia equi)-which causes equine ehrlichiosis, tick-borne fever, and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE)-and E. canis, which is the type species of the genus Ehrlichia, by 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison, homology being 83.3% and 82.4%, respectively. 16 N. risticii is a tiny gram-negative coccus and stains dark blue to purple with Romanowsky's stain . N. risticii tends to occupy one side of the cytoplasm rather than being symmetrically or evenly distributed. N. risticii generally is round but sometimes is pleomorphic and may be elongated, especially in tissue culture. The organism divides by binary fission and is found in membrane-lined vacuoles within the cytoplasm of infected eukaryotic host cells, primarily macrophages and glandular epithelial cells in the intestine of the horse. N. risticii occurs in at least two different forms: multiple dark, small organisms (0.2 to 0.4 \u00b5m) enveloped by the host membrane (called morulae) and relatively light, large forms (0.8 to 1.5 \u00b5m) individually tightly wrapped with host membrane. 17, 18 Morulae appear to interchange with individually enveloped forms, because an intermediate stage appearing as moderately dense ehrlichial cells tightly enveloped with the host membrane that is continuous with the membrane surrounding a morula, has been seen. 19 N. risticii in T-84, P388D 1 , and U-937 cells, in primary equine monocyte culture, and in infected equine tissues is seen primarily in individual forms, especially in intestinal epithelial cells. 19, 20 However, several recent N. risticii isolates make inclusions as large and as tightly packed as E. canis inclusions. 21, 22 Vacuoles containing N. risticii do not fuse with lysosomes. The inhibition of lysosomal fusion is not a generalized process but rather is restricted to vesicles that contain N. risticii. 23 Transmission electron microscopy reveals that N. risticii has distinct ribosomes and DNA strands. [17] [18] [19] Clumps of ribosomes are distributed homogenously in the cytoplasm rather than being marginated beneath the cytoplasmic membrane. Compared with those of the rickettsiae or ordinary bacteria, the DNA and ribosomes in N. risticii are packed more loosely in the cytoplasm except for the small, dense form. Thus the electron density of ehrlichial organisms is similar to that of the host cell cytoplasmic background, and this low contrast makes finding N. risticii in infected tissue difficult at low magnification under the electron microscope. N. risticii is surrounded by thin, bileaflet outer and inner membranes ( Figure  2.4-2) . Unlike the rickettsiae, ehrlichial organisms show no thickening of either leaflet of the outer membrane. 18, 19 Morphologically, N. risticii does not appear to contain significant amounts of peptidoglycan. 19 Peptidoglycan is counterproductive when considering the intracellular life of N. risticii because the organism requires the provision of an effective diffusion rather than mechanical protection by peptidoglycan.",

The metabolic activities of N. risticii have been investigated. N. risticii can use glutamine and glutamate and generate adenosine triphosphate as rickettsiae do. 10, 24 The preference of glutamine over glutamate is likely because glutamine penetrates phagosomes better than glutamate. N. risticii cannot use glucose-6-phosphate or glucose 10 and is similar to the genus Rickettsia, but the rate of adenosine triphosphate synthesis is much lower than in Rickettsia typhi. 24 The greatest metabolic activity of N. risticii is observed at a pH of 7.2 to 8.0 and declines drastically at a pH below 7. 10 This finding suggests that N. risticii can prevent acidification and lysosomal fusion of the vacuole where it resides.",

DNA from N. risticii has been detected in virgulate cercariae in freshwater operculate snails (Pleuroceridae: Juga yrekaensis) from northern California, 26, 27 in virgulate xiphidiocercariae isolated from snails (Pleuroceridae: Elimia livescens) in central Ohio, 28 and from snails (Pleuroceridae: Elimia virginica) in central Pennsylvania. 29 This type of trematode is known to become metacercaria in aquatic insects, and N. risticii DNA has been detected in mesocercaria and metacercaria in various aquatic larval and adult insects such as mayflies and caddisflies in northern California 30 and in central Pennsylvania. 29 One horse fed adult caddisflies in northern California 31 and two horses fed adult caddisflies or a mixture of adult caddisflies and mayflies in central Pennsylvania developed PHF. 29 16S rRNA gene sequences and 51-kd antigen amino acid sequences obtained from culture isolates from horses, horse blood, and caddisflies were identical, proving oral transmission and establishment of stable infection of N. risticii in the horse as the cause of PHF in Pennsylvania. 29 Ingestion of the larval stage of aquatic insects or cercariae in the water did not transmit N. risticii. 31 Blood-sucking arthropods such as Dermacentor variabilis, black flies, eye gnats, biting midges, and mosquitoes have been found to be negative for N. risticii transmission. 32 Experimental injection of cell-cultured N. risticii or infected horse blood and reisolation of the organism have revealed that dogs, cats, mice, and nonhuman primates can be infected, although only mice and cats developed significant clinical signs. [33] [34] [35] [36] PHF may have zoonotic potential, because N. risticii can cause mild clinical signs in primates. 36 Seroepizootiologic studies showed that cats, dogs, foxes, pigs, and goats in an endemic area of Maryland develop antibodies to N. risticii. 37 The reservoir potential of these animals is currently unknown. Dogs demonstrating symptoms of canine ehrlichiosis were seropositive to N. risticii (but not E. canis), and an agent identical to the 16S rRNA N. risticii was isolated from the dogs in this report. 38 However, the potential for this canine isolate to infect horses and cause PHF is undetermined.",

Ehrlichial release appears to occur not only by cell lysis but also through exocytosis by fusion of the inclusion membrane with the plasma membrane. In the case of intestinal epithelial cells, which make a monolayer tightly connected by circumferential zones of intercellular junctions, ehrlichial organisms appear to be transmitted between adjacent cells in vitro by a coupled exocytosis in one cell and endocytosis in an adjacent cell. 20 Unlike ordinary gram-negative bacteria, N. risticii does not activate macrophages fully in vitro. N. risticii induces only low levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and prostaglandin E 2 production in macrophages. In contrast, infected macrophages produce large amounts of interleukin-1, and this may be related to the pathogenesis of the disease. 46 This difference may be caused by a lack of lipopolysaccharides in N. risticii. N. risticii in general does not induce a severe inflammatory reaction in equine tissues. 18, 45 ",

In vitro, professional phagocytes (monocytes and macrophages) of host animal species have no intrinsic resistance to infection with N. risticii. In addition, intestinal epithelial cells and mast cells, which are normally not phagocytic, are induced to take up N. risticii. N. risticii binds to equine macrophages but not polymorphonuclear leukocytes. N. risticii entry into P388D 1 cells is blocked by monodansylcadaverine, an inhibitor of transglutaminase that inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis, suggesting entry in this fashion. 48 Ehrlichial internalization, proliferation, and intercellular spreading, but not binding, depended highly on the host transglutaminase and microtubule system, 48, 49 as well as on calcium-calmodulin 50 and protein tyrosine kinase. 51 N. risticii can be taken up readily by equine polymorphonuclear leukocytes but is destroyed rapidly in those cells. 48 Polyclonal equine antiserum to N. risticii does not inhibit binding or internalization of N. risticii to P388D 1 macrophages, but internalized antibody-coated N. risticii fails to survive. 52 Because the antigen-binding fragment of the equine anti-N. risticii immunoglobulin G (IgG) blocks the binding of N. risticii to P388D 1 macrophages, antibody-coated N. risticii most likely enters macrophages via the Fc receptor. The mechanisms of destruction of antibody-coated N. risticii in macrophages are presently unknown.",

N. risticii induces a specific antibody response in the natural host or in experimental animals, regardless of the presence of clinical signs. The presence of the antibody, however, does not always correlate with clearance of ehrlichial organisms and presence of protective immunity. An IgM response occurs a few days after the initial infection and lasts for less than 2 months. A challenge injection did not elicit an IgM response. Several days after N. risticii infection of the horse, tests for IgG antibody became significantly positive. 54 Development of neutralizing antibodies in infected horses also was demonstrated using a cell culture system and a murine model for PHF. 41 Three mechanisms of antibody neutralization have been shown. In the first mechanism, antibody blocks ehrlichial binding to its specific receptor, instead making it bind through the Fc receptor. In the second mechanism, the antibody directly inhibits ehrlichial metabolism as demonstrated by reduced 14 C-CO 2 production from 14 C-L-glutamine in host cell-free N. risticii in the presence of the antibody. 52 The third mechanism is antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity. Macrophages infected with N. risticii present ehrlichial antigens on their surface similar to virus-infected cells and are lysed when incubated with antiehrlichial antibody and normal equine peripheral blood monocytes. 55 Five to seven major antigens were exposed on the surface. 56 These antigens are considered to be the target in antibody-mediated neutralization.",

In the author's laboratory, IgG IFA titers of 20 or higher represent a positive serologic result. For serologic testing for N. risticii infection, the higher the titer is, the greater the correlation is with PHF clinical disease. The chance of healthy horses having a titer of 40 or less is similar to that of ill horses (early and late stages, and low levels of infection with N. risticii or possible cross-reaction with other microorganisms). Thus at a titer of 40 or less, although the horse is seropositive, the current disease is not likely to be caused by N. risticii.

Several means of solving this problem are these: First, N. risticii organisms should be seen clearly in the cytoplasm of the host cells by IFA staining at magnification of 1000 times. If staining is blurred, morphologically different from positive control staining or Giemsa-stained infected cells or if extracellular objects are stained, the sample should not be judged positive. Second, positive and negative control equine sera must be tested to ensure the quality of the entire IFA procedure each time, including the quality of the antigen slides used and fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-horse IgG. Third, to reduce nonspecific binding, the author's laboratory uses 0.02% Tween-20 in the phosphate buffered saline washes. Usually serial dilution of the serum takes care of the problem of nonspecific binding if the titer of the sera is sufficiently high. If none of these procedures work, the author preabsorbs the equine sera with uninfected macrophages cultured and prepared under the same condition as the N. risticii-infected macrophage antigen. Western immunoblot analysis has been developed and is useful in distinguishing sera that have a nonspecific IFA reactivity or react by IFA to cross-reacting antigens. 70, 71 An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed using purified N. risticii as the antigen. 54 The IgM titer rises earlier during the course of infection than the IgG titer. A rise in IgM titer occurs only at the time of initial infection, and the titer becomes negative in 1 to 2 months. 55 Thus an IgM ELISA is not useful for detecting chronic or multiple infections but is useful for early diagnosis of a primary infection of nonvaccinated horses. Several other serologic tests such as latex agglutination 72 and monoclonal antibody-based competitive ELISA have been reported. 73 However, to date a rapid and reliable field serodiagnostic test is not yet available.",

However, the 51-kd protein amino acid sequence from caddisflies in Pennsylvania differs only at 7 amino acid positions (98.6% identity) from N. risticii Maryland strain over the 483 amino acids that can be compared. 29 An association of heterogeneity of N. risticii strains and PHF vaccine failure in Virginia and Maryland was reported. 77 Thus multiple strains or subspecies of N. risticii, or Neorickettsia spp. in the field, are likely to be distinguishable by Western immunoblotting or monoclonal antibody labeling of antigens but not by IFA or ELISA serologic testing of infected horse sera. Sequencing the antigenic protein genes further clarifies these strains. The existence of divergent antigenic variants should be taken into consideration in improving the serodiagnosis and efficacy of vaccines for PHF in the field.",

Treatment should not be delayed until laboratory confirmation is obtained from a second IFA test. It is important to point out that in the field PHF and salmonellosis can occur concurrently. 70 Weak seropositive or seronegative results of vaccinated horses when they develop clinical signs compatible with PHF are useful for ruling out the possibility of this infection.

            "text": "In vitro, N. risticii is susceptible to doxycycline, demeclocycline, and oxytetracycline but is resistant to erythromycin and nalidixic acid. 81 As with other rickettsiae, N. risticii is resistant to aminoglycosides because they penetrate host cells poorly. Although oxytetracycline alone is bacteriostatic, it was found to induce lysosomal fusion with ehrlichia-containing vacuoles in P388D 1 cells, 23 thus becoming bactericidal. Oxytetracycline and doxycycline frequently correct the pyrexia and other clinical signs of PHF within 24 to 48 hours, which by itself is diagnostic. 67 Although doxycycline is more effective than is oxytetracycline in vitro and is highly effective in mice inoculated with N. risticii, 81, 82 oxytetracycline is preferred for the equine species because intravenous administration of doxycycline has an acute toxic effect. 83 Intravenous oxytetracycline at 6.6 mg/kg of body mass twice a day for 7 days was effective in 71% (five of seven) of experimentally infected ponies when ponies were treated after development of severe clinical signs. 67 Oxytetracycline is effective when given immediately after the development of fever but before development of diarrhea. 84 In the murine model of PHF, doxycycline, given on the fifth day, has the best effect on the immune response. When doxycycline is given on the third or seventh day after infection, immunodepression caused by N. risticii infection is more severe. 82 Although erythromycin or rifampin alone has a poor effect in controlling N. risticii infection in vitro or in infected mice, 80,81 the orally administered combination of erythromycin and rifampin has been efficacious in treating experimentally infected horses. 85 Other supportive therapy frequently is required for acutely ill horses if they are to show clinical improvement. Dehydration is corrected by the oral or intravenous administration of polyionic isotonic fluids. Brief therapy (2 to 7 days) with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (e.g., phenylbutazone, flunixin, meglumine, or aspirin) for horses may be valuable early in the course of treatment to help in the management of clinical signs of PHF. 84",

Vaccines prepared from inactivated cell-cultured N. risticii are available for PHF from three commercial sources. Formalin-inactivated whole organism vaccine with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant has been reviewed. The vaccine is reported to cause no ill effects in horses except for swelling at the injection site in 10% of the animals. 88 Studies published in 1987 reported 78% prevention of all clinical signs except fever. 89 Protection conferred by this vaccine appears to be much shorter in duration compared with infection-induced protection. IFA titers measured after vaccination are also lower and drop rapidly in contrast to what occurs in natural infection. 88 Vaccination is not necessary for up to 2 years in the horse that has recovered from illness or has a high IFA titer from natural exposure or subclinical infection, because infection-induced immunity provides better protection than do vaccines. For nonexposed animals, considering the time required to develop immunity after vaccination, the short-lasting immunity to even the homologous strain of N. risticii, and the existence of antigenic variants in the field, how much benefit the vaccine will provide in the field challenge is unknown. Vaccine failures have been reported. 21, 42, 66, 77 Therefore improvement of vaccine for PHF is desired.",

In one seroepidemiologic survey, horses residing in the foothills of northern California had greater exposure to A. phagocytophilum than did those residing in the Sacramento Valley. 100 Because most seropositive horses in this study were healthy, subclinical infection with A. phagocytophilum seems to occur as PHF. Recent findings indicate that the western black-legged tick, Ixodes pacificus, is able to transmit A. phagocytophilum and may act as a competent vector in the field. 101,102 A. phagocytophilum can cause parasitemia in dogs, cats, goats, sheep, and nonhuman primates with mild to no clinical signs. 91, 103, 104 Cattle, rats, mice, guinea pigs, hamsters, or rabbits are not susceptible to infection. 103, 104 Gribble suggested that the horse may be an accidental host, based on the low incidence of the disease. 91 Whether other species of animals can serve as a reservoir for equine ehrlichiosis is unknown, although white-footed mice recently were shown to serve as an enzootic reservoir of the HGE agent. 105 A structural protein of A. phagocytophilum called ank has repeats in amino acids that are similar to the repeats within the human erythrocyte ankyrin protein. Comparison of these amino acid sequences in A. phagocytophilum isolated from horses, a dog, cattle, ticks, and human patients from several geographic regions in the United States and Europe revealed that the isolates are heterogeneous and not segregated by host animal species, but rather segregated by geographic locations. 106, 107 Intravenous inoculation of horses with infected human blood produces a disease indistinguishable from that caused by A. phagocytophilum, 108 and like N. risticii, diverse gene sequences detected among horse isolates indicate equine ehrlichiosis is caused by multiple strains of organisms.",

Because A. phagocytophilum from the horse has not been propagated in vitro in sufficient quantity, an antigen prepared from the buffy coat cells of an experimentally infected horse is used as the antigen for immunologic studies. 109 Spontaneously recovered animals are immune to reinfection from 2.5 to 20 months. Maternal antibody protects foals from the disease for up to 2 months, but not from establishment of infection. When an immune mare was challenged, small numbers of infected neutrophils were seen in a 15-day-old foal born to the mare. 91 Oxytetracycline treatment eliminates A. phagocytophilum from horses, but rechallenge induces minimal clinical signs, suggesting the development of protective immunity in the recovered horse. Although the blood of recovered horses is reported not to be infectious, blood collected from ponies at 81 or 114 days after primary infection with A. phagocytophilum induced mild clinical signs (fever and mild thrombocytopenia) in susceptible recipient ponies but did not protect the recipient animals against a second challenge 100 days later. Thus A. phagocytophilum appears to persist in small numbers despite the concomitant presence of antibodies and the demonstrable inhibition of leukocyte migration. 109 ",

All three horses were infected as determined by PCR, but sequences of 16S rRNA gene of A. phagocytophilum in three horses were different from that of the type strain, indicating strain and disease variations. 102 Clinical signs of disease include fever lasting 1 to 9 days, depression, partial anorexia, limb edema, petechiae, icterus, ataxia, and reluctance to move. 105 In contrast to N. risticii infection, laminitis does not develop in equine ehrlichiosis. 110 Experimental inoculation of seven pregnant mares caused clinical signs of various severity, but none of the mares aborted. Hematologic changes observed included thrombocytopenia, decreased packed cell volume, and significant leukopenia, first involving lymphocytes and then granulocytes. The disease is inapparent to mild and is usually not fatal except for injury resulting from ataxia or secondary infection. A. phagocytophilum morulae are found in the cytoplasm of neutrophils and eosinophils only during the acute phase of the disease.

A. phagocytophilum can be seen in granulocytes of buffy coat smears during the acute phase of the disease at 1000 times magnification. When more than three ehrlichial inclusion bodies (morulae) are seen, the diagnosis is considered definitive. 110 Culture isolation of A. phagocytophilum from the blood of horses rarely is performed, although A. phagocytophilum is isolated routinely from human patients with HGE. An IFA test using the buffy coat cells of the infected horse as the antigen has been developed and has been useful in detecting and titrating antibody in recovered horses. 109 Infected ponies become seropositive by IFA test at 21 days after inoculation, and antibody titers as high as 1:1280 can be detected at day 75 after inoculation. Major surface protein antigens of approximately 44 kd of A. phagocytophilum from an HGE patient were cloned in the author's laboratory 111 and others and have been used for serodiagnosis by dot blot Western immunoblot and ELISA of human patients. Because human and horse isolates are highly antigenically cross-reactive, these serologic assays are applicable for diagnosis of equine ehrlichiosis. Nested PCR has been developed for detection of A. phagocytophilum 16S rRNA gene in horse blood and ticks. 112 The genes ank and p44 also are used for PCR diagnosis of human HGE patients.

The capsule of Cryptococcus neoformans inhibits leukocyte accumulation, cytokine secretion, and macrophage phagocytosis. 162 Mutants without capsules are highly infective and avirulent. As indicated earlier, many fungi are engulfed by macrophages, and intracellular survival is mediated by virulence factors. Macrophages are capable predators of Candida albicans, 163 H. capsulatum, 164 and B. dematitidis. H. capsulatum is primarily a yeast in vivo, and this form infects macrophages. Phagolysosomal fusion occurs at a normal rate, 165 but blockage of acidification of the phagolysosome occurs. 166",
