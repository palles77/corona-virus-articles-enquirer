After binding of the G protein to the cellular surface receptor, the fusion protein F mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Recently, ephrin B2 (EB2) has been shown to function as main entry receptor for NiV (Bonaparte et al., 2005; Negrete et al., 2005) . EB2 is a transmembrane-anchored ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinases EphB2, EphB3 and EphB4, and plays a critical role in embryonic patterning, axon guidance and angiogenesis (Adams, 2002; Kullander and Klein, 2002) . As EB2 is predominantly expressed on endothelial cells and neurons (Adams, 2002) , this is consistent with the known cellular tropism for NiV (Wong et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "For successful virus entry into EB2-expressing cells, a fusion-active NiV F protein is required. As other paramyxoviral F proteins, the NiV F protein is synthesized as inactive precursor and is cleaved by host cell proteases into the subunits F 1 and F 2 . Thereby the hydrophobic fusion peptide at the N-terminus of F 1 is released. Interestingly, the recently uncovered proteolytic cleavage mechanism used by henipavirus F proteins differs fundamentally from that utilized by related viruses. Other paramyxoviral fusion proteins are either processed by extracellular trypsin-like proteases after reaching the cell surface or after being incorporated into budding viruses, or they are cleaved by the Golgi protease furin during transport along the secretory pathway (Klenk and Garten, 1994) . Because most of the F proteins in virus particles are cleaved and fully fusion competent, paramyxoviruses can enter new host cells via fusion of the viral membrane and the plasma membrane at neutral pH (Earp et al., 2005) . However, henipavirus F proteins are neither cleaved by trypsin-nor furin-like proteases but must be activated by cathepsin L (CTSL) within an acidic endosomal compartment Meulendyke et al., 2005; Pager and Dutch, 2005; Pager et al., 2006) . Cleavage efficiency strongly depends on endocytic activity and the expression level of CTSL which varies markedly in different cell types. Even though some cleaved F protein is expressed on the surface of all cells tested so far, the Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Virology 375 (2008) 391 -400 www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro percentage of cleaved NiV F protein is generally low (Moll et al., 2004a; Diederich, unpublished) . Thus, most of the F protein present on the plasma membrane is not fusion competent. This raised the question if NiV particles released from infected cells contain sufficient amounts of activated F protein to enter a new host cell directly by pH-independent fusion with the plasma membrane, or if virus endocytosis and subsequent F cleavage by endosomal CTSL are essential for the entry process. The aim of this study was to clearly define which steps of the NiV replication cycle require endocytic and proteolytic processes.",

After addition of recombinant mouse EphB4/Fc, a soluble EB2 receptor fused to the Fc region of human IgG, cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h to allow binding of EphB4 and co-endocytosis of EB2 and EphB4/Fc.

After permeabilization, internalized EphB4/Fc was visualized by incubation with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody.

            "text": "To determine if NiV particles bound to EB2-expressing cells are also internalized, we made use of the recent finding that the NiV G protein is released in virus-like particles (VLPs) upon single expression (Patch et al., 2007) . The G-containing VLPs resemble infectious NiV particles in shape and size (not shown) and can therefore be utilized to study G-mediated attachment and uptake into host cells outside of the BSL4 facility. VLPs were generated by transfection of 293T cells with the NiV G tag gene. At 72 h post transfection, supernatants were clarified by low-speed centrifugation and pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion. VLP-containing pellets were resuspended and added to EB2-expressing cells in combination with an antibody directed against the HA-tag. After 1 h at either 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C, surfacebound antibodies were stained with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody at 4\u00b0C. After permeabilization, internalized VLPs were visualized with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody and cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Merged pictures of the FITC, rhodamine and DAPI fluorescence channels are shown in Fig. 2A . As expected, no intracellular VLPs could be detected in the sample incubated at 4\u00b0C ( Fig. 2A, control-4\u00b0C). In contrast, a substantial amount of VLPs was found within the cells (red dots) if endocytosis was allowed at 37\u00b0C ( Fig. 2A , control-37\u00b0C). When we performed the VLP uptake assay in the presence of 0.45 M sucrose which is known to inhibit endocytic uptake in general, internalization was clearly inhibited (Fig. 2B , + sucrose). Many VLPs had bound to the surface of sucrose-treated cells (green dots), but intracellular VLPs were found less frequently. In order to reveal the endocytic pathway required for VLP uptake, either 25 \u00b5M chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent internalization, or 5 mM \u03b2-methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD), an inhibitor of caveolaedependent endocytosis, was added prior and during uptake of the VLPs. Chlorpromazine had basically no negative effect on the internalization indicating that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is not involved (Fig. 2B , + chlorpromazine). In contrast, MCD which removes membrane cholesterol and disrupts lipid rafts thereby preventing uptake via caveolae, markedly inhibited VLP endocytosis (Fig. 2B , + MCD). To quantify the effect of the inhibitors on VLP uptake, the number of internalized VLPs in 40 randomly chosen cells of each sample was counted and averaged. When VLP uptake in untreated cells incubated at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 2B , control-37\u00b0C) was set at 100%, chlorpromazine inhibited were incubated with EphB4/Fc for 1 h at 37\u00b0C to allow binding and endocytosis to proceed. Surface-remained EphB4/Fc was stained with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (surface). After fixation and permeabilization, internalized EphB4/Fc was detected by a FITCconjugated secondary antibody (intracellular). endocytosis by only 11%, whereas sucrose and MCD treatment produced a 48% and 51% uptake inhibition, respectively. This result suggests that internalized VLPs have entered the cells via caveosomes. In agreement, internalization of EB2 was also significantly reduced in the presence of sucrose and MCD (data not shown).",

For this, NiV particles were concentrated and partially purified from infected cell supernatants. Viruses were then adsorbed to Vero cells and labeled with an anti-NiV serum at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, cells were either shifted to 37\u00b0C to allow endocytosis of surface-bound virions, or were kept at 4\u00b0C. Antibodies on the cell surface were then detected by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies and internalized virus-antibody complexes were stained with rhodamine-coupled secondary antibodies after cell permeabilization. If cells were not shifted to 37\u00b0C, no intracellular staining was observed (Fig. 2C, 4\u00b0C ), but numerous intracellular (red) viruses could be detected after incubation at 37\u00b0C when uptake of virus particles was allowed (Fig. 2C, 37\u00b0C) . This demonstrates that a substantial portion of surface-bound NiV particles can enter the cells via endocytosis. Together, these findings supported the concept that NiV uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis might be an additional or alternative route of virus entry to fusion at the plasma membrane.",

(A) Vero cells were incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C (control-4\u00b0C) or at 37\u00b0C (control-37\u00b0C) with purified NiV G tag -containing VLPs in combination with a monoclonal antibody directed against the HA-tag. Surface-bound VLPs were visualized by incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies at 4\u00b0C. After permeabilization with methanol-acetone, intracellular VLPs were stained with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining. Merged pictures of the DAPI, FITC and rhodamine fluorescence channels are shown. (B) Cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with the following endocytosis inhibitors: 0.45 M sucrose (sucrose), 25 \u00b5M chlorpromazine (chlorpromazine) or 5 mM \u03b2-methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD). Incubation with VLPs and HA-tag antibody was performed for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence or absence of the inhibitors. Surface-bound and intracellular VLPs were stained as described above. (C) Vero cells were incubated with infectious NiV particles for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. After incubation with anti-NiV serum for 30 min on ice, cells were either shifted to 37\u00b0C or kept at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. Surface-bound and intracellular antibodies were visualized as described above. Fig. 3 . Effect of endocytosis inhibitors, NH 4 Cl, and cathepsin inhibitors on F protein cleavage. Vero cells expressing the NiV F protein were radiolabeled with [ 35 S]-Promix for 10 min and were then incubated in chase medium containing the indicated inhibitors for 2 h. F proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, separated on a 12% SDS gel under reducing conditions, and subjected to autoradiography. either affecting endocytosis (sucrose, chlorpromazine, MCD), or preventing acidification of the endosome (NH 4 Cl) or inhibiting CTSL-mediated cleavage (E64d, CatLIII, CA074ME), were assayed for their inhibitory effects on F protein cleavage. Here, F-transfected Vero cells were metabolically labeled with [ 35 S]cysteine and -methionine for 10 min and incubated for 2 h in the absence or presence of different concentrations of the various inhibitors. After cell lysis, F proteins were immunoprecipitated, separated on a 12% SDS gel under reducing conditions, and subjected to autoradiography. In Fig. 3 , the results are shown for the optimal inhibitor concentrations, thus the highest drug con-centrations showing no cytotoxic effect within 2 h. Non-specific inhibition of all endocytic processes by 0.45 M sucrose as well as specific inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by 25 \u00b5M chlorpromazine almost completely prevented proteolytic processing of F 0 into F 1 and F 2 . This confirms our previous findings in MDCK cells that F cleavage depends on a tyrosine-dependent motif in the cytoplasmic tail which mediates endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits . In contrast to chlorpromazine treatment, addition of MCD only slightly affected F protein processing (Fig. 3 , 5 mM MCD). This demonstrates that caveolae-mediated endocytosis is not predominantly involved in Fig. 4 . Effect of inhibitor treatments during and after virus entry on NiV infection. (A) Inhibitor treatment before and during virus entry. Vero cells were infected with NiV at a MOI of 0.2. Cells were treated with the indicated inhibitors for 1 h prior infection and for 1 h at 37\u00b0C during virus adsorption and entry, or were left untreated (control). Then, inhibitors and input virus were removed, cells were washed and further incubated in medium for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. After fixation and permeabilization, cells were incubated for 1 h on ice with a polyclonal anti-NiV serum and primary antibodies were detected with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. (B) Inhibitor treatment after virus entry. After infection of Vero cells with NiV for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, cells were washed and then incubated in the absence (control) or presence of the indicated inhibitors. At 24 h p.i., immunostaining was performed as described above. There was no generalized toxicity effect of any of the inhibitors at the concentrations used in this experiment. the proteolytic activation of newly synthesized F proteins, even if this endocytic pathway was found to be involved in EB2 and VLP uptake and might therefore play a role in receptor-mediated NiV uptake. When F protein cleavage was analyzed in the presence of 20 mM NH 4 Cl, 20 \u00b5M E64d, a general cysteine protease inhibitor, 50 \u00b5M CA074ME, an inhibitor of cathepsin B and L (Montaser et al., 2002; Pager and Dutch, 2005) , or 20 \u00b5M CatLIII, a CTSLspecific inhibitor, cleavage was found to be completely prevented (Fig. 3 ). This confirms that F activation in Vero cells depends on low pH and CTSL.",

In these infection experiments, the minimal, non-cytotoxic concentrations required for maximal cleavage inhibition determined before were used. All drugs and inhibitors were added to Vero cells 1 h prior infection and were present during NiV infection at 37\u00b0C. Because most of the infectious NiV had bound and entered the cells after 60 min and further incubation did not result in a more efficient infection (not shown), non-bound viruses and inhibitors were removed after 1 h of infection and cells were further cultured with serum-free medium. At 24 h post infection (p.i.), supernatants were taken for virus titration. To determine the amount of infected cells and to visualize syncytium formation, cells were immunostained using a polyclonal anti-NiV serum. As shown in Fig. 4A , NiV infection in untreated cells (control) induced extensive cell-to-cell fusion as indicated by the formation of large multinucleated syncytia. Interestingly, neither the addition of endocytosis inhibitors (0.45 M sucrose, 2 or 5 mM MCD, 25 \u00b5M chlorpromazine) nor treatment with 20 mM NH 4 Cl, nor the addition of cathepsin B and L or CTSL-specific inhibitors (50 \u00b5M CA074ME; 20 \u00b5M CatLIII) had an effect on NiV infection. The amount and the size of syncytia were similar to those in the control infection, and also the virus titers in the cell supernatants did not substantially differ (Table 1 , Inhibitor treatment during entry). As a control, Vero cells were infected with fowl plague virus (FPV) under the same conditions because it is well established that entry and fusion of influenza viruses absolutely depend on internalization and acidic pH within endosomes (Marsh and Helenius, 1989) . The finding that FPV infection was drastically reduced when either endocytosis (0.45 M sucrose) or acidification of the endosome (20 mM NH 4 Cl) was prevented clearly demonstrated that virus entry can be effectively hindered by the inhibitor treatments before and during virus adsorption (Fig. 5) .",

In inhibitor-treated cells, the mean number of single NiV-positive cells ranged from 2.0 to 2.8. Thus, the number of cells initially infected by NiV was very similar in all infections. This again indicates that inhibitor treatments did not interfere with virus entry and initial infection but solely prevented virus spread via cell-to-cell fusion and the release of infectious virus particles. Thus, endocytosis, acidic pH and cathepsin-mediated cleavage are not important for the initiation of a NiV infection in a new host cell but are only required during late stages of infection for the activation of newly synthesized F proteins.",

Receptor binding and low pH are known to be the two main triggering mechanisms responsible for conformational changes in the viral glycoproteins leading to virus-cell fusion. For pH-independent viruses such as paramyxoviruses, structural changes in the fusion protein occur through interaction with the viral receptor (Lamb et al., 2006) . For pH-dependent viruses such as toga-, rhabdo-, alpha-, flavi-and orthomyxoviruses, low pH triggers conformational changes in the fusion protein after internalization into endosomes (Jardetzky and Lamb, 2004; Kielian and Rey, 2006) . For endocytic uptake many different pathways are used by these viruses including macropinocytosis, phagocytosis, clathrin-and caveolae-mediated pathways and some less-well defined routes called non-clathrin-, noncaveolae-dependent pathways (Marsh and Helenius, 2006 ). An additional pH-and endocytosis-dependent entry strategy has been recently proposed for Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). These viruses enter a new host cell via endocytosis followed by acid-dependent digestion by cathepsins to accomplish the fusion competence of the viral glycoproteins (Chandran et al., 2005; Kaletsky et al., 2007; Schornberg et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "At least for coronaviruses, it is known that members of the same virus family can use distinct pathways for fusion protein activation and virus entry. Whereas SARS-CoV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-2 require uptake by endocytosis and subsequent proteolysis by cathepsins (Qiu et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2005) , infectious bronchitis virus only needs an acidification step (Chu et al., 2006) and the MHV-A59 strain or human CoV NL63 can enter the cell by pH-independent fusion at the plasma membrane (Huang et al., 2006; Qiu et al., 2006) . The finding that the NiV F protein must be activated by endosomal proteases raised the possibility that NiV, similar to SARS-CoV, MHV-2 or Ebola virus, and in contrast to other paramyxoviruses, depends on pH-and CTSL-dependent mechanisms of entry. The idea that NiV can use other pathways than direct fusion at the plasma membrane was also encouraged by the recent report that Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a prototype member of the paramyxovirus family, can enter the cells via caveolae-mediated endocytosis (Cantin et al., 2007) . Since EB2 is a raft-and thus caveolae-associated membrane protein (Gauthier and Robbins, 2003) and is furthermore constitutively internalized from the cell surface, NiV might enter caveosomes via receptor-mediated endocytosis. In support of this hypothesis, we found that EB2and VLP uptake was affected by MCD, an inhibitor of caveolaemediated endocytosis. However, MCD, sucrose or chlorpromazine treatment during virus entry had only a slight negative effect on productive virus infection. This indicates that none of the endocytic pathways is required during early virus replication steps. Consequently, acid-dependent endosomal F cleavage by CTSL cannot be a prerequisite for successful NiV entry. In agreement, addition of NH 4 Cl or cathepsin inhibitors during early virus replication steps did not significantly reduce the infection. Even if these results do not rule out that endosomal entry pathways can be an alternative route of virus entry, they clearly show that post entry F processing in endosomes is not required for the infectivity of NiV. Similar to paramyxoviruses with furinactivatable F proteins such as measles or mumps virus, NiV F cleavage occurs before virus assembly and incorporation into budding virus particles.",

            "text": "In contrast to paramyxovirus F proteins which are activated by furin, most of the surface-expressed NiV F protein is uncleaved. Even if 60-70% of newly synthesized NiV F proteins are cleaved within 2 h in Vero cells (compare Fig. 3A) , less than 10% of the protein found on the cell surface is proteolytically processed and fusion active (Moll et al., 2004a) . This is very likely due to an inefficient recycling to the plasma membrane after clathrinmediated uptake and CTSL cleavage of endocytosed F proteins. Since paramyxovirus assembly is mainly directed by interactions of the matrix protein with the cytoplasmic or transmembrane portions of the viral glycoproteins (Peebles, 1991) , proteolytic processing of the F ectodomain has no influence on the incorporation into budding particles. Thus, the content of cleaved F protein in cell-free virus particles directly depends on the amount of activated protein present in the cellular compartment where the assembly process has taken place. The fact that despite the low amounts of cleaved F proteins on the plasma membrane, fully infectious NiV particles containing about 75% of cleaved and fusion-active F proteins are released from infected cells might indicate that NiVassembly does not occur at the cell surface but at endosomal membranes. Fitting into this concept, the second NiV envelope glycoprotein, the G protein is also internalized from the cell surface (Vogt et al., 2005) . The recent finding that the NiV M protein contains a late domain motif of the YxxL type known to interact with AP-2, a component of the clathrin-associated adaptor complex, and with AIP-1/ALIX, which functions in the formation of multivesicular bodies, a specialized endocytic compartment (Ciancanelli and Basler, 2006; Chen et al., 2005; Irie et al., 2007; Puffer et al., 1997) , further supports the idea that endosomal compartments are not only involved in proteolytic activation of the F protein but might also be the site where all viral components are recruited for virus assembly.",

Inhibitors were either added 1 h before infection and for 1 h during virus adsorption and entry (Inhibitor treatment during entry) or were added 1 h after virus entry (Inhibitor treatment after entry). NiV infection was performed as described above. The amount of infected cells and syncytium formation were determined by indirect immunofluorescence. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h and permeabilization with methanol-acetone, cells were incubated with the polyclonal guinea pig anti-NiV serum at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Primary antibodies were then detected with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (dilution 1: 250). Images were recorded using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Virus titers in the supernatant were determined by the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) method on Vero cells (Reed and Muench, 1938) .",
