Several ASO-based drugs directed against oncogenes have been developed for therapy of lung cancer, and some have recently reached clinical trials. ASO and siRNA to respiratory syncytial virus infection have demonstrated good potential to treat this condition, particularly in combination with an antiviral drug.
