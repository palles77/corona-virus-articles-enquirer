Faecal samples were collected from preweaned calves, young stock and cows. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected by sodium chloride flotation and epifluorescence microscopy. Molecular diagnostics were used to identify Cryptosporidium species. Samples containing C. parvum were further analysed to determine subtypes. Calf faecal samples were also analysed for rotavirus, coronavirus and Escherichia coli F5+. Total protein was assessed in 1-to 8-day-old calves. A questionnaire was used to identify differences in management routines. Cryptosporidium infection was diagnosed in all herds, with equal prevalence in case and control herds in all three age groups. Cryptosporidium parvum, Cryptosporidium bovis, Cryptosporidium ryanae and Cryptosporidium andersoni were all identified, as were rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli F5+. C. ryanae and C. andersoni were only detected in non-diarrhoeal samples, whereas the other pathogens were detected in both diarrhoeal and non-diarrhoeal samples. Diarrhoea was more common in case herd calves. Disinfection of single pens was more common in case herds and several other management routines seemed to differ although results were not significant.",

Farmers may suffer large economic losses due to veterinary treatments, mortality and reduced growth rates. Calf diarrhoea has a multifactorial aetiology, and Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that is frequently associated with the disease (de la Fuente et al. 1999; Joachim et al. 2003; Snodgrass et al. 1986 ). The parasite is resistant in the environment (Fayer 2008) , creating high infection pressures in some affected herds. Other common diarrhoeal pathogens are rotavirus, coronavirus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F5+ (Barrington et al. 2002; de la Fuente et al. 1999; Foster and Smith 2009 ). E. coli F5+ causes diarrhoea in calves younger than 1 week, whereas the other three pathogens mainly cause diarrhoea in 1-to 3-week-old calves. Individual calf factors such as failure of passive transfer of colostral antibodies, and management associated factors such as personnel and stable hygiene, routines at calving, milk feeding regimens and crowding, affect the course of disease (Barrington et al. 2002) .",

In contrast to C. parvum, C. bovis, C. ryanae and a fourth larger species, Cryptosporidium andersoni, are considered to be associated with subclinical infection in cattle (Fayer et al. 2007; Langkjaer et al. 2006) . We have shown that Cryptosporidium parasites are ubiquitous in Swedish dairy herds but we found no association between infection and diarrhoea in individual calves (Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2009 ). With the help of DNA analysis, we identified C. bovis as the most prevalent species (74%) in preweaned calves, and C. parvum, C. bovis and C. ryanae were all detected in diarrhoeal calves (Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2010) . It is thus not correct to conclude that diarrhoea is associated with C. parvum solely based on the presence of C. parvum-like oocysts. The improved diagnostic methods call for to further examine the relationship between Cryptosporidium infection and diarrhoea. It is also important to identify additional factors affecting the course of infection because a key component for improved calf health in herds with Cryptosporidium-associated diarrhoea is to decrease infection pressure by improved management. The objective of this herd level case-control study was to investigate the role of Cryptosporidium infection, with the added value of information on the different Cryptosporidium spp. in Swedish dairy herds facing a problem with calf diarrhoea. To get a more complete picture of the diarrhoeal problems, other pathogens and animal and management factors were also investigated.",

Rectal faecal samples were collected from 10 calves (\u22642 months old), 10 young stock (4-12 months old) and five periparturient cows (1 week before expected partus to 2 weeks post partum). Any additional calves with diarrhoea were also sampled. Eight herds had insufficient number of calves, young stock or periparturient cows at sampling, in which case all calves or young stock in the preset age interval and five cows as close to the preset interval as possible were sampled. Jugular vein blood was collected in serum tubes from a maximum of five 1-to 8-day-old calves in each herd. For sampled calves, a number of parameters, e.g. age, the consistency of faeces, general condition, pen environment and any medical treatment (drug, disease and dates of treatment) were recorded. For sampled young stock and cows, consistency of faeces and age were recorded. For cows the number of days in relation to calving was also recorded.

An animal was considered Cryptosporidium positive if at least one C. parvum-like oocyst or C. andersoni oocyst was detected in the microscope. Statistical calculations were done at herd and calf level, using \u03c7 2 test, Fisher's exact test or the Mann-Whitney test. Epidemiological modelling was done at calf level to determine factors associated with being a case herd calf, using logistic regression with robust standard errors to adjust for clustering of observations within herds. Variables were first screened in univariable logistic regression models, and variables with p\u22640.25 were considered for further analyses. Collinearity between variables was investigated using Spearman rank correlations. Multivariable modelling was done by forward selection, using p\u22640.05 as a retaining criterion. Confounding was assessed as each variable was entered or deleted from the model. If the odds ratio (OR) of any variable category changed >25%, the confounding variable was retained in the model. When a final main effects model had been achieved, previously deleted variables were re-entered and evaluated again, and then two-way interactions were investigated. The final model was diagnosed using the Pearson goodness-of-fit test and the receiver operating characteristic curve, and plotting deviance and Pearson residuals against the linear prediction of residuals. Any detected outliers were investigated further.",

Shedding rates approximately follow bell shaped curves over time, and shedding intensity and diarrhoeal intensity seem to peak around the same time (Jarvie et al. 2005; Joachim et al. 2003; Lallemond et al. 2006; Lefay et al. 2001; Villacorta et al. 1991) . For calves with high C. parvum shedding rates, it is thus likely that the parasite is associated with diarrhoea, and the identification of high numbers of C. bovis oocysts in diarrhoeic samples indicates that this species can cause diarrhoea in calves. C. bovis has been associated with subclinical infection (Sant\u00edn et al. 2004 ), but massive intestinal invasion with subsequent diarrhoea should be possible if enough other factors, such as lack of passive immunity, are present, even if this species would lack virulence factors similar to those present in C. parvum.",

Because intestinal damage is caused by the intracellular parasite stages, diarrhoea might be present already when the first few oocysts are shed because these do not reflect the intensity of intestinal invasion. Moreover, calves with failure of passive transfer of colostral antibodies have poor health to start with, and might develop diarrhoea more easily and at a lower degree of intestinal invasion than calves with sufficient passive transfer. On the other hand, if the few oocysts reflect lowgrade infection, the real cause for diarrhoea could be an unidentified pathogen. Repeated samplings are crucial to confirm or reject the association between infection and diarrhoea in these calves, but that could not be done in this study.",

GP60 subtypes are also identified in the human species C. hominis and have been associated with varying pathogenicity in HIV patients (Cama et al. 2007 ).

Still 40% of diarrhoeic Cryptosporidium-positive calf samples were sequenced, compared to 28% of non-diarrhoeic samples. Although only two Cryptosporidium-positive calf samples per herd were subjected to DNA analysis, these represented a random sample and should not bias the species distribution. At least one of the investigated pathogens were detected in most diarrhoeic samples but an equal or even higher percentage of the non-diarrhoeic calves also harboured them. In addition, only one of 16 calves with mixed infections had diarrhoea. About half of all diarrhoeic calves were older than 4 weeks. This indicates that other diarrhoeal causes such as Eimeria spp., or dietary imbalances could also be present in the herds of this study. However, diarrhoeal pathogens outside the \"C. parvum diarrhoeal window\" were not targeted because the main focus was to investigate the role of different Cryptosporidium species in herds with diarrhoeal problems. The reason for including calves older than 4 weeks is that we have shown Cryptosporidium infection to be common in this age group (Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2009 ). Preweaned calves are often kept close together so these calves may act as an important infection source for the younger ones. Indeed, a high prevalence in old calves was shown in this study as well (Fig. 1) . Young stock and cows were also included to get an impression of the overall Cryptosporidium infection pressure in the herds.",

We have no explanation for the results regarding rotavirus. We used the same ELISA, and the same person performed the (Bj\u00f6rkman et al. 2003; de Verdier Klingenberg and Svensson 1998) . The coronavirus results are not so surprising. Bj\u00f6rkman et al. (2003) found a low prevalence (3%) of coronaviruspositive diarrhoeal samples, and in a recent Norwegian study (Gulliksen et al. 2009 ) no diarrhoeal samples were positive for coronavirus. In addition, our results are supported by Snodgrass et al. (1986) who found coronavirus to be equally common in healthy and diseased calves. The low prevalence of E. coli F5+-positive samples was in accordance with previous studies (Bj\u00f6rkman et al. 2003; de Verdier Klingenberg and Svensson 1998) . Other pathogens such as Salmonella spp. have been reported as common calf diarrhoeal pathogens (Barrington et al. 2002) . In addition, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is recognised as an important calf health modulator worldwide, among other things causing immunosuppression and diarrhoea. As a result of successful control programmes, BVDV and Salmonella are uncommon in Swedish cattle, with 99.8% of herds being free from BVDV (professor Stefan Alenius, personal communication), and Salmonella only being identified in five to 13 herds per year (Anonymous 2007). Although diarrhoea was more common in case herd calves, in total only 31 of 196 sampled calves had diarrhoea at sampling. This could be due to naturally fluctuating infection pressures. Even if diarrhoeal prevalences were quite low in case herds and pathogen distribution was similar in healthy and diarrhoeal calves from case and control herds, the identification of herds as cases or controls were performed by veterinarians with insight into the herds' calf health status. We thus are confident that cases and controls were correctly classified. Ten case-controls is a small sample size, but a larger sample was not possible for logistic reasons.",

            "text": "An interesting finding was that disinfection of single pens between calves was much more common in case herds. The same association has been shown for weaners . This association could be seen as an effect-i.e. herds with diarrhoeal problems start to disinfect. However, because these herds still had problems, disinfection seemed either not to work or to be insufficient. Moreover, if disinfection routines were started a short time prior to sampling, the full effect might not have been reached at the time of sampling. We did not ask about how long these routines had been used, and cannot investigate this possibility further because of the high risk of recall bias. A potential explanation for disinfection not working is that farmers rely on the disinfectant to do the work of reducing infection pressure instead of cleaning thoroughly. Without proper cleaning, only the surface of the dirt layer is disinfected, pathogens can continue to thrive beneath, and calves are exposed again as soon as the top layer is disrupted. Cryptosporidia are resistant to most commercial disinfectants (Fayer 2008) . Thus, if cryptosporidia constitute a large part of the problem even proper disinfection that reduces viral and bacterial pathogens would not be successful. Of the disinfectants used by farmers in this study, Virkon has not proven effective against Cryptosporidium oocysts (Fayer 2008, Table 1.9) . Lime seems to reduce oocyst numbers (Graczyk et al. 2008; Zintl et al. 2010) . These studies used quicklime (CaO) on sewage sludge (Graczyk et al. 2008) or hydrated lime (Ca [OH] 2) in water solution and purified oocyst solutions incubated in used bedding material (Zintl et al. 2010 ). The effect of powdered hydrated lime on faecal oocysts has to our knowledge not been tested. Still, this might be at least partially effective in reducing oocyst load. We have not been able to identify references concerning the components of Stalosan F. Drying and heating are effective for decreasing oocyst viability (Fayer 2008 , Table 1 .7). Thus, proper cleaning (with water), followed by drying and use of powdered quicklime, or the use of deep litter bedding (provided that the surface is regularly overlaid with dry, clean bedding material) might be two effective ways of keeping Cryptosporidium infection pressure down.",

The type of diarrhoea most common in preweaned calves could also be seen as an effect rather than a risk for belonging to a case herd. This variable was introduced in the model as an indicator of total infection pressure, hypothesising that a low total infection pressure would be more associated with pasty diarrhoea and that a high total infection pressure would be more associated with watery diarrhoea. Because some farmers stated that the type of diarrhoea varied considerably, this represented a third level of the variable. Indeed, although the level watery diarrhoea tended to have higher OR, this was the level that produced a significantly higher OR compared to pasty diarrhoea.
