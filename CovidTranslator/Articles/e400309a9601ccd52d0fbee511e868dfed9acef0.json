Among the domestic animals, domestic pig (Sus scrofa f. domestica) suffers most frequently from the disease in human environment. This is a typical animal-borne disease observed mainly in occupational groups employed in agriculture, farming (of animals and birds), fishing and manufacturing industry. Methods We are presenting the clinical course of infection (E. rhusiopathiae) and discuss clinical forms. E. rhusiopathiae in humans may have the following clinical course: mild form of skin infection diagnosed as local erythema (erysipeloid), disseminated form of skin infection and the most serious form of infection of systemic course (endocarditis and sepsis).",

Infection occurred after skin cut on the right leg with the fragment of the pig bone. Patient observed the presence of skin inflammatory process; subsequently, the process spread in the form of phlegmon of the right leg integuments. Patient was initially treated in the Department of Surgery and referred to the Orthopaedic Clinic due to skin phlegmon. Bacteriological tests revealed E. rhusiopathiae. Patient underwent drainage of the subcutaneous tissues. Targeted antibiotic therapy was implemented and continued for about 3 weeks after operation. As the family reported, patient reported back pain localised in the thoracic segment in the midline; nevertheless X-ray imaging of the spine was not performed, any local changes were observed within the paravertebral and superficial tissues. During admission and hospitalisation in the Neurosurgery Department, patient was suffered from glycaemia instability. As the normal levels of glycaemia were obtained, patient underwent operation. With regard to the process including distant vertebras and the risk of instability, double-level decompressing hemilaminectomy on the Th5-Th6 level was performed. Pus cistern of paravertebral localisation was found immediately after the incision of fascia lata. Infiltration of vertebral arches, vertebral joints and spinous processes was also observed. After flavectomy, epidural empyema was observed inside the spinal canal. Flow drainage of the operation field was performed for 5 days. In the post-operational period, cephalosporin was intravenously administered. Cultures and fragments of excised tissues were taken for histological examination. Local culture samples were collected from the wound during chronic infection as well as blood culture samples at the stage of systemic symptoms. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae were isolated. The patient was administered antibiotics based on culture outcomes and antibiogram. After spinal surgery, no pathological growth was observed in the collected samples-negative cultures.",

Viral zoonoses are widespread, in recent years, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) has been a large problem in Far East Asia. In the epidemiological aspect, the reason for SARS infection is coronaviridae, coming from a big Chinese cat so-called civet-a culinary delicacy from the region of Kanton. This disease afflicts the respiratory system, usually takes the form of a mild infection with a fever, however, severe cases of life-threatening pneumonia may occur [2, 7, 24, 30, 36] . Avian influenza (bird flu) recently, world news has been dominated by data related to the form of influenza of zoonotic origin. The epidemiology of the phenomenon has been related to the areas of Far East Asia, actions aimed at the counteraction of the epidemic spread consisting in the mass liquidation of chicken farms constituting a natural reservoir of the epidemic have represented a particularly drastic view. The infections of avian influenza are caused by A H5N1 virus, whose reservoir in nature is wild fowl, the virus is transmitted easily to poultry and shows very high pathogenicity. On poultry farms it undergoes numerous modifications and can be pathogenic to humans. The virus is widespread in the world, it is found in many organisms, also in humans. In certain situations, it becomes pathogenic. Poultry farms, particularly in Asian areas, are thought to be the source of modification of avian influenza virus gaining the properties of a pathogen that is dangerous to human organisms. In such situations, the monitoring of poultry farming as well as quick identification of an infection in humans is of extreme importance. Even slight number of diagnosed infections caused by avian influenza in humans, sometimes unfortunately of very severe course, constitutes particular information about the virus pathogenicity and consequently leads to the decision of liquidating a given reservoir [11, 21, 26, 29, 47] .",

This virus undergoes constant modifications. Infections in humans can be caused by the influenza virus that infects pigs and so far there have been such cases among persons having contact with animals, particularly among farm workers. However, recent infections found in the human clinic are mutated forms of viral infections where the virus contains elements of both human and avian influenza genome. In such situation, a pig farm can be the reservoir where a certain virus may undergo mutation and become dangerous to human and the infection course may be severe.",

Despite effective therapy of skin manifestation of the disease, recurrences of disease and sepsis occurred. Bacterium is sensitive to majority of penicillins, cephalosporins and lincosamides. The resistance is presented towards aminoglycosides and vancomycin. Proper therapy of skin changes is of crucial importance-management in the initial phase of disease, so that the antibiotic therapy is proper and the insignificant scratch did not become an exit point of generalised infection [5, 10, 34, 41] . For severe forms of infection, sepsis and endocarditis, recommended antibiotic therapy should be administered by 4-6 weeks or longer depending on the form of the course and localisation of infection, i.e. in complicated purulent knee endoscopic surgery presented in the case report antibiotic therapy was administered for 16 weeks [19, 42, 45, 46] .",
