After intragastric administration, it was observed that live Lc-expressing S1 protein combined with Lc-expressing N protein could elicit much more potent mucosal and systemic immune responses than the former alone (P<0.001), however slightly inferior to the latter alone (P>0.05). Furthermore, the surface-displayed mixture (PG1-S1+ PG1-N) revealed stronger immunogenicity than the secretory mixture (PG2-S1+ PG2-N) as well as PEDV-neutralizing potency in vitro (P<0.001). On 49th day after the last immunization, splenocytes were prepared from mice immunized with surface-displayed mixture, secretory mixture and negative control to be stimulated by purified N and S protein, respectively. The results of ELISA analysis showed that N protein was capable of inducing a higher level of IL-4 (P<0.001) and IFN-\u03b3 (P<0.001) than S1 protein in the immunized mice. Taken together, Lc-expressed N protein as molecular adjuvant or immunoenhancer was able to effectively facilitate the induction of mucosal and systemic immune responses by Lc-expressing S1 region.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes lethal diarrhea in piglets, resulting in great economic losses all over the world, and is a member of Coronaviridae, causing severe entero-pathogenic diarrhea especially in piglets. PEDV belongs to group I coronavirus which consists of PEDV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) (Vijgen et al. 2004) , feline coronavirus (FeCoV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and human coronavirus NL63 (NL or New Haven) (BaoXian et al. 2009; van der Hoek et al. 2004) . PEDV and TGEV caused the diseases characterized by rather similar clinical symptoms which make it rather difficult to draw a clear dividing line between them. Both of them replicate in the differentiated enterocytes of the small intestine and cause severe diarrhea (Sanchez et al. 1992) . Several viral proteins are important for inducing an immune response to PEDV: the spike protein (S, 180-220 kDa), the membrane protein (M, (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) , and the nucleoprotein (N, 55-58 kDa) (Egberink et al. 1988 ). The S glycoprotein of PEDV possessed an immunodominant region S1 (Liyun et al. 2008) and plays a crucial role in the early steps of infection. It mediates binding of the virus to the cell surface and the subsequent fusion between the viral and cell membranes (Yeo et al. 2003; Duarte and Laude 1994) . PEDV N protein forms a helical nucleocapsid with genomic RNA and is the predominant antigen produced in coronavirus-infected cells, thus making it a major viral target. Therefore, N protein as a sensitive diagnostic antigen was used to develop specific and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Hou et al. 2007a; Rodak et al. 2005) . However, N protein was not able to induce immunoprotection against PEDV infection owing to an envelope surrounding the virion shielding (Ge et al. 2009; Hou et al. 2007b) .",

Efficient protection against mucosal infections requires the development of new vaccines that induce protective immune responses not only at the systemic level but also at the mucosal level in order to inhibit the entry of virus into the body through the mucosal approach (Mota et al. 2006) . This can best be achieved by mucosal vaccination, a route which offers several advantages over the traditional parenteral vaccines. The potential development of lactic acid bacteria to deliver heterologous antigens to the mucosal immune system has been proposed; these have many properties that make them attractive candidates as antigen delivery carriers for the presentation to the mucosa of compounds with pharmaceutical interest, in particular vaccines (Perdign et al. 2001; Mercenier et al. 2000; Wells et al. 1996) .",

The mucosal response was further investigated by measuring anti-S1 or anti-N sIgA level in the feces, vaginal, nasal, and ophthalmic lavage fluids and intestinal mucus post-intragastric immunization via ELISA. The level of specific IgG anti-S1 or anti-N in the sera of experimental mice indicated that systemic immune response was induced by the recombinant Lc. The concentration of sIgA or IgG antibody was expressed as titers that were determined by the expression of the test samples to a standard curve generated by serial dilution of commercially purchased IgA or IgG (Sigma) of known concentration. Since 7 days after the first immunization, the higher levels of IgA specific for S1 that could be observed in the animal group that received a mixture of PG1-S1+ PG1-N or PG2-S1 + PG2-N in four kinds of samples including nasal, feces, ophthalmic, and vaginal lavage fluids (Fig. 4a-d) are significantly different from the groups that received PG1-S1 (P<0.001, P<0.001, P<0.001, P<0.001, and P<0.001) and PG2-S1 (P<0.001, P<0.001, P<0.001, P<0.001, and P< 0.001), respectively. Analysis of the sera obtained from the same animals revealed that the animals that displayed the higher levels of IgA also displayed a higher level of IgG (Fig. 4e) , showing correlation in the production of these two kinds of antibody. On the 77th day, there was an obvious trend of PG1-S1+ PG1-N > PG2-S1 + PG2-N > PG1-S1 > PG2-S1 in the titers of IgA in the intestinal mucus (Fig. 4f) . However, higher levels of IgA or IgG specific for N were induced by PG1-N and PG2-N but not PG1-S1+ PG1-N and PG2-S1 + PG2-N (Fig. 5a-e) . The trend of PG1-N>PG2-N>PG1-S1+ PG1-N>PG2-S1 + PG2-N was observed in the intestinal mucus IgA titer on the 77th day (Fig. 5f ). The levels of IgG or IgA in all animal groups did not show significant difference from each other before the first immunization (preimmune). By contrast, as might be expected, no significant elicitation of antibodies was observed in negative or blank control (data not shown).",

The goal is to provide the first line of defense by effectively eliminating pathogens at the mucosal surface. There were several studies focused on surface-displayed expression system based on bacteria (Ge et al. 2009; Hou et al. 2007a; Lee et al. 2006) . However, surface display of antigens on the bacterial surface has been problematic because large antigens perturb membrane topology. True surface exposure of antigens requires a transmenbrane anchor that is long enough to cross the cell wall (Lee et al. 2006) . At least 100 amino acids are needed to properly cross the cell wall (Leenhouts et al. 1999) . In this report, we have developed a surface display system using the poly-gamma-glutamate synthetase A protein (pgsA) as the transmembrane anchor to present heterologous proteins on Lc. We adapted pgsA derived from the pgsBCA enzyme complex of B. subtilis isolated from chung-kook-jang (a traditional Korean soybean paste used as a food additive).",

The corresponding recombinant strains PG2-S1 PG1-N (Ge et al. 2009 ) have been constructed in our previous work. Lcexpressing S1, Lc-expressing N, and a mixture of equal parts of Lc-expressing S1 and Lc-expressing N were used to vaccinate mice via oral route, respectively. Although the amount of Lc-expressing S1 in the mixture was just half as much as that of Lc-expressing S1 alone for oral administration, a much higher level of IgG (serum) or IgA (mucus) specific for S protein was elicited by the mixture, which was consistent with PEDV neutralizing activity reflected by plaque reduction assay. However, antibody response specific for N protein induced by the mixture was inferior to that by Lc-expressing N. In view of the above-mentioned facts, we could speculate that N protein seems to play a crucial role in the production of higher-level antibody by the mixture, but S protein does not. Subsequently, we observed that the secretory level of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 of splenocytes isolated from mice immunized with the mixture stimulated by N protein was obviously higher than S protein. Theoretically, IL-4 could effectively advance the proliferative differentiation of B cells to plasma cells secreting a large amount of antibody. IFN-\u03b3 as an important member of cytokines has a vital role to play in directing immune responses and regulating immune network, especially the aspect of antivirus effect. As described above, it was undoubtedly logical that the mixture induced higher with PG1-S1+ PG1-N, PG2-S1+ PG2-N, PG1-S1, PG2-S1, PG1, and PG2. Values are means (\u00b1standard deviation) of three replicates per treatment in one experiment, which was repeated twice. *P<0.001 antibody responses against S protein. In theories, IL-4 could inhibit IL-12 pathway so that the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 is down-regulated. However, the result showed that IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 were together induced by N or S1 to make Th1/ Th2 relatively balanced with the greater amount of IL-4 than IFN-\u03b3, which demonstrated that Th2 response was a leading one. The target protein expression completely depended on the xylose induction in this study owing to the L. casei expression systems based on xylose operon regulation. According to the above statement, the induced recombinant strains were able to stimulate the mucosal immune system of the gastrointestinal tract for several days but not a lifetime after oral administration in mice, which did not result in immunotolerance against target antigen. When the induced recombinant bacteria colonized on the mucosal surface, although xylose was not present, the target protein has been still keeping a secretory or trans-membrane state in the host cell and was recognized, processed, and presented by relevant lymphocytes in the mucosal immune system, which could induce local immune responses.",

Statistically significant differences were observed since the seventh day after the first immunization. As far as the same antigen was concerned, recombinant Lc PG1 was greater than Lc PG2 in the induction of antibody immune responses, which was a conspicuous event in this study. On the premise of the same bacterial amounts, the quantity of antigen anchored on the surface of Lc PG1 was far larger than Lc PG2 (data not shown) when recombinant Lc colonized the mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract because Lc PG2 secreted antigen into the external milieu. In addition, both Lc PG1 and Lc PG2 are inducible expression systems based on xylose operon and could not keep a sustainable expression of the target protein. In summary, recombinant Lc PG1 possessed stronger immunogenicity. Moreover, we have tried S1-N fusion protein expressed in Lc but failed using various promoters, which indicated that not every gene can be expressed efficiently in a host organism.",

Taking the difficult expression of the whole S protein of PEDV in L. casei into consideration, an oral vaccine that induces neutralization of an antibody must include S protein immunodominant region S1 (Ho et al. 2005; JunWei et al. 2009; Liyun et al. 2008) . For a successful immune response against an antigen, it is necessary that the antigen is present in sufficient quantities and in a form that can be recognized by antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. Consequently, L. casei suitably acts as mucosal vaccine carrier against gastrointestinal tropism pathogens.

By combining knowledge from the different disciplines, virology, molecular biology, immunology, bioinformatics, ecology, and epidemiology, even greater progress is expected to be made towards understanding of the importance of live bacterial carriers and the underlying principles of mucosal vaccination therein (Collins and Schodel 1997) . The elucidation and characterization of the physical structure, chemical composition, and bioinformation of bacterial cell wall and surface protein have provided new and challenging opportunities which allow us to better understand the interaction between intestinal Lactobacilli and mucosal tissues. The recent development of molecular biological techniques could permit the construction of lactic acid bacteria-presenting foreign antigens exposed to the different immune organizations and for the first time make it opportunistic to further explore the potential of these safe food bacteria as vaccine vehicles (Gentschev et al. 2001) .",

Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel methods to analyze expressed genes encoding antigens in situ so as to control the efficiency and persistence of expression. In addition, what is the optimal proportion of Lc-expressing S1 and Lc-expressing N in a mixture yielding better immune efficacy and how long could recombinant bacteria persist in the gastrointestinal tract remain in need of further research.",
