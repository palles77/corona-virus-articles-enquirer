It has been possible to control many serious human diseases (smallpox, poliomyelitis, yellow fever, tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese B encephalitis, hepatitis A and B) as well as common viral infections of children (mumps, measles, chicken pox and rubella) by safe and effective vaccines. Influenza virus vaccines are also reasonably effective, provided that the vaccine is made against the circulating virus strains. However, there are many virus infections which currently cannot be prevented by vaccination. These include chronic infections which may be difficult targets for the immune system [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and papillomaviruses], infections that are more common in the developing countries (dengue, hepatitis E), and infections which have been newly discovered or are spreading to new areas [West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus]. Common respiratory infections, caused by rhinoviruses as well as other virus groups, are an important health and economic burden. Since the rhinoviruses alone include about a hundred different serotypes, these infections cannot be prevented by vaccination.",

            "text": "We will review several virus groups that have been targeted by antiviral drugs (Table 1) . However, it is clear that our antiviral arsenal remains inadequate in many ways and that the search for new antiviral compounds and strategies continues to be essential. Nevertheless, significant progress on this front has been achieved during recent years. This may not be surprising, since the \"postgenomic era,\" during which the nucleotide sequences of entire genomes have been determined, has existed for many virus groups for two decades or even more. It has been possible to produce, purify and crystallize viral proteins, which has allowed structure-based approaches for the design and synthesis of new antiviral drugs. The search for antiviral agents crucially depends on detailed understanding of the reactions and interactions occuring at the molecular level during viral infection. Every essential step in the virus life cycle is a potential site for antiviral intervention, as summarized in Table 2 . Virus-encoded protein targets are attractive, because they are not present in uninfected cells, but host targets involved in viral replication can also be considered. In this review, we will focus on recent advances and prospects in small molecule synthetic antivirals against various groups of RNA viruses. We will not consider antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, RNA interference or general immunomodulatory substances such as interferons, all of which may be promising in some instances. Antiviral agents inhibiting the herpesviruses date back to the 1950s and 1960s [idoxuridine (IDU) and trifluorothymidine (TFT)]. As these drugs have toxic side effects, they have only been used topically. Adenine arabinoside (Ara A) is less toxic and can be used systemically in severe herpes simplex virus infections. However, a breakthrough was made when acyclovir (ACV) was synthesized in 1977. This compound is phosphorylated to ACV-monophosphate by the herpes virus thymidine kinase only, followed by further phosphorylations to ACVtriphosphate by cellular kinases, whereafter it is incorporated into DNA causing chain termination. From the 1980s on, ACV has been followed by the improved derivatives ganciclovir, penciclovir, famciclovir and valaciclovir, with wider applications against several herpesviruses (Table 2 ) (reviewed in De Clercq 2004) .",

HIV may be considered to be a success story in antiviral drug development, as a formidable effort has transformed this lethal infection to a disease, which can be controlled to some extent (Pomerantz and Horn 2003) . The virus was isolated in 1983, and in 1987 the first specific treatment was approved. This was zidovudine (also known as azidothymidine or AZT), an inhibitor of the viral polymerase, called reverse transcriptase. Zidovudine Fig. 1 ). However, it was soon realized that HIV rapidly becomes resistant to zidovudine and other compounds given as monotherapy due to mutations that appear in the reverse transcriptase. Major breakthroughs were achieved in the mid-1990s, when non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and inhibitors of the viral protease were approved for treatment (Table 2 ). These developments led to the now prevalent triple combination therapies, which most commonly include a protease inhibitor or NNRTI together with two NRTIs. However, even these regimens, known as highly active antiretroviral therapy, cannot completely eradicate HIV from the body.",

            "text": "The most recently approved protease inhibitor, atazanavir, can be taken once daily. It appears to have a unique resistance profile compared with the other protease inhibitors (Colonno et al. 2004 ) which means that viruses that have become resistant to atazanavir should still be susceptible to many of the other protease inhibitors. Furthermore, atazanavir does not induce changes in serum lipid levels (Sanne et al. 2003) . Changes in lipid metabolism have been a significant problem associated with protease inhibitor treatments. Yet another protease inhibitor, tipranavir, is in phase III clinical trials (Plosker and Figgitt 2003) . Tipranavir is the first efficacious nonpeptidic inhibitor of the HIV protease ( Fig. 1 ). It appears to have an improved resistance profile in that multiple mutations in the protease are required for high level resistance. Therefore, HIV strains resistant to the previously developed inhibitors still appear to be susceptible to tipranavir (Larder et al. 2000) , and tipranavir might be primarily used as a salvage therapy for patients in which other protease inhibitors have failed. In the NNRTI class, capravirine is in phase III clinical trials. It may have activity against mutants resistant to other NNRTIs, although only limited peer-reviewed information is available. In contrast to the polymerase and protease inhibitors, compounds affecting the third enzyme encoded by HIV, namely the integrase, are still in relatively early development. It appears that specific and non-toxic inhibitors of integrase are difficult to develop, since integrase shares properties with other enzymes interacting with nucleic acid substrates. However, some very potent compounds have been reported recently (Hazuda et al. 2004) .",

The first entry inhibitor has already been approved. This is a 36-amino acid synthetic peptide known as enfuvirtide (Matthews et al. 2004) . It is identical in sequence to a portion of the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp41, and acts by forming a complex with a fusion-activated conformer of gp41, thereby inhibiting the and VX-950), as well as the nonpeptidic tipranavir, which inhibits HIV protease. SCH-C, pirodavir and pleconaril inhibit HIV and rhinovirus entry, respectively, whereas enviroxime appears to target the picornavirus RNA replication complex fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Due to its chemical nature, enfuvirtide is very expensive to manufacture and it has to be administered by frequent injections. Many other agents targeting the entry process are being developed (Moore and Doms 2003) . Several small molecule compounds bind to the HIV co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 and prevent HIV from using these proteins in the entry process. The first of these was known as SCH-C and it specifically targeted CCR5 (Strizki et al. 2001) (Fig. 1) . SCH-C has subsequently been displaced by another compound, SCH-D. CCR5 is the co-receptor used by most HIV strains. It is not essential for normal development in mice, suggesting that it may be blocked without major side effects. Thus, many companies are targeting CCR5, and promising compounds include UK-427857, developed by Pfizer (Table 2) .",

Annual influenza epidemics swipe the globe and occasional new virulent strains cause pandemics of great destructive potential. In the event of a pandemic strain, it may be impossible to manufacture the required quantities of the specific vaccine in time. Amantadine and rimantadine have been available for influenza treatment for a long time, but they have not been extensively used due to their side effects and the rapid development of resistant virus. The influenza virion surface proteins hemagglutinin (which binds cell surface neuraminic acid during virus entry) and neuraminidase (which removes neuraminic acid residues from glycoproteins to allow efficient virus release) have for a long time been the major focus of anti-influenza drug development. Their structures have been known since the early 1980s. The target first preferred was hemagglutinin (HA). However, all attempts failed due to the unfavorable geometry of the sialic acid binding site within the HA protein (Wade 1997) . In contrast, neuraminidase has been successfully targeted by small neuraminic acid derivatives designed on the basis of protein structure (von Itzstein et al. 1993; Kim et al. 1997) . These compounds, inhaled zanamivir and orally administered oseltamivir, have now been approved for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment for influenza virus infection (Gubareva et al. 2000) . Even under optimal conditions these two drugs cannot replace vaccination. However, they offer a means to alleviate the serious symptoms of influenza and in prophylactic use may even prevent the disease (Aoki et al. 2003; Hayden et al. 2004) . Neuraminidase inhibitors together with amantadine are the only means against a putative rapidly spreading new pandemic influenza infection. Therefore, the unnecessary use of these drugs should be restricted to a minimum to avoid the creation of drug-resistant influenza virus strains (Gubareva 2004) .",

The most recently identified compounds (BMS-433771, VP-14637) are orally bioavailable and inhibit virus replication in mouse models (Cianci et al. 2004; Douglas et al. 2003) . It has been speculated that the RSV fusion protein can bind several different classes of small molecules, and that the fusion process, with its attendant changes in protein conformation provides multiple targets for inhibition. Together with the successful targeting of the HIV fusion protein, this may indicate that viral fusion proteins in general could be promising targets for drug development (see also Plemper et al. 2004) . The different approaches for the treatment of paramyxovirus infections have been reviewed recently (Saladino et al. 2003) .",

Previously they were recognised as a major cause of mild respiratory infections in humans, for which there was no significant need for treatment. Within a year of the recognition of the SARS virus and the sequencing of its genome, several structures of viral replicase proteins have already been determined, and inhibitor studies are in progress. The coronavirus genome encodes several types of enzymes (Snijder et al. 2003) , all of which may be considered potential targets for inhibition. Ribavirin, given intravenously to patients suffering from SARS-CoV infection during the outbreak in 2003, was shown to be ineffective in a carefully conducted study (Sung et al. 2004 ). Existing drugs, as well as large compound libraries, are being screened in large-scale efforts to find inhibitors of SARS-CoV that could be used in case the lethal virus reappears ). The major challenge in the treatment of respiratory infections is that the causative agent need to be accurately and very rapidly identified after the onset of symptoms. As the infection has already progressed significantly when the symptoms appear, antiviral treatment must be initiated prophylactically, or immediately after appearance of symptoms, in order to have any effect. This is a factor that has limited the use of the current anti-influenza virus drugs (Gubareva et al. 2000) , and is likely to be an even more significant handicap in treating milder respiratory infections.",

In both viruses, one of the structural proteins (VP1) displays a narrow 25 \u00c5 deep cleft or canyon encircling the 12 five-fold vertexes of the viral icosahedron.

In phase I clinical trials disoxaril turned out to be too toxic. New compounds were developed and have been tested against the rhinoviruses and some other picornaviruses.

These studies showed that pleconaril was well tolerated, but caused only a slight reduction in the severity of the symptoms. The FDA did not give permission to use pleconaril (\"Picovir\") as an antiviral drug to treat the common cold, since there was some evidence that the drug interfered with the action of contraceptives.

It was first identified in 1989, and a blood test became available in 1992. The virus establishes a chronic infection in up to 85% of cases, and it is estimated that HCV has infected more than 170 million people worldwide. As a chronic infection with active virus replication, HCV resembles HIV, and a combination of several drugs will probably be required for effective management or eradication of the virus. The current therapy for hepatitis C is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) modified form of interferon-\u03b1, used in combination with ribavirin ( Fig. 1 ) (Moradpour et al. 2002) . Although the combination therapy can be quite efficient, it is limited by significant toxicity and lack of response in a large number of patients. Fusion of PEG molecules with interferon results in a biologically active drug with a longer half-life and more favorable pharmacokinetics. Ribavirin is a broad-range antiviral agent, but the mechanism(s) of its action is still unclear. It is believed to inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme that catalyses a ratelimiting step in GTP synthesis. This leads to a decreased pool of GTP levels in the cell, indirectly leading to the suppression of viral RNA synthesis (Tan et al. 2002) . It has also been suggested that ribavirin can act as an RNA virus mutagen, forcing viruses into error catastrophe (Crotty et al. 2000) .",

Research on HCV replication has been hampered by the lack of reproducible infectious culture systems and small-animal models (Tan et al. 2002) . However, the study of HCV replication and the development of new therapies has been considerably advanced by the recent development of a cell culture model for HCV, the replicon system (Lohmann et al. 1999) . The system is based on the stable replication of subgenomic selectable HCV RNAs, which can be propagated efficiently in huh-7 human hepatoma cells. High levels of replication depend on cell culture adaptive mutations that arise in several of the nonstructural proteins. The replicon system does not allow the production of infectious virus particles.",

It is a small molecule that is biologically available through oral ingestion. The ability of BILN 2061 to inhibit NS3 protease activity in human liver cells was tested using the replicon system. In human trials BILN 2061 showed very promising results. The suppression of the viral load in patients treated with BILN 2061 was significantly greater than in IFN-treated patients. VX-950 (Fig. 1) is another small molecule NS3 protease inhibitor that was identified through a structurebased drug design approach, evolving from the natural NS5A-NS5B substrate. The inhibitory effect of VX-950 on polyprotein processing was tested using the HCV replicon system (Lin et al. 2004) . The action of VX-950 was compared to that of BILN 2061, and the data suggest that these molecules have different mechanisms of inhibition. Distinct drug-resistant mutations were identified for both protease inhibitors, and mutants that are resistant to BILN 2061 remain fully sensitive to VX-950 (Lin et al. 2004) . is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of IMPDH. A recent study using the replicon system demonstrated that IMPDH inhibitors such as VX-497 enhance the antiviral activity of ribavirin in vitro (Zhou et al. 2003) . The results showed that combination treatment with ribavirin and an IMPDH inhibitor increased the replicon error rate. This data is consistent with the suggestion that ribavirin can act as a mutagen. The results of the phase II clinical trials showed that triple combinations of merimepodib, PEG-interferon and ribavirin were well tolerated and led to a statistically significant increase in the proportion of patients with undetectable levels of hepatitis C virus after 24 weeks of treatment. Viramidine (Fig. 1) is a prodrug of ribavirin, which is converted by adenosine deaminase to ribavirin in liver cells. Compared to ribavirin, there is less uptake of viramidine into red blood cells due to the positive charge of the molecule. This results in the reduction of hematological toxicity (one of the side effects of ribavirin). Phase II clinical trials have shown that viramidine may be as effective as ribavirin against hepatitis C, but can decrease the patients' risk of developing anemia (Tan et al. 2002) .",

Ribavirin, 6azauridine and glycyrrhizin inhibit dengue and some other viruses in cell cultures (Crance et al. 2003) . Systematic in vivo studies with ribavirin have not been encouraging.

The origin of this negative-strand RNA virus is still obscure, but together with the similar Marburg virus, Ebola is one of the most contagious and pathogenic viruses known, as more than half of the infections may be fatal. Mouse-adapted Ebola virus has been used as model for the testing of antiviral drugs. Non-toxic dose of an S-adenosyl-homocysteine hydrolase inhibitor, carbocyclic 3-deaza-adenosine (Cc 3 Ado) (Fig. 1) resulted in the survival of most of the animals, when given 1 or 2 days after infection (Bray et al. 2000) . Inhibitors of this enzyme have been previously shown to inhibit rhabdo-and paramyxoviruses (De Clercq 1998) . One possibility is that by lowering the concentration of S-adenosyl-homocysteine in cells, these drugs interfere with the methylation step of viral RNA capping (see below). Hantaan viruses, which can cause severe renal hemorrhagic syndrome, have been treated with some success with intravenous ribavirin (Huggins et al. 1991) .

Since the complete genome sequences of many poxviruses are available, it would be possible to reconstruct the variola virus. The previously used vaccines are not available in quantities required to vaccinate the general population, and they also occasionally cause severe complications. For these reasons, existing antiviral drugs against poxviruses, and especially against variola, have been re-evaluated. One of the earliest agents was the thiosemicarbazone derivative methisazone (Marboran), which was used with success in the prophylaxis of smallpox in India in 1960s and in the treatment of vaccination complications. Due to its side effects it was not accepted for wider use. It still may be a good lead for drug development. Many drugs developed against other viruses have been shown to inhibit the replication of the vaccinia virus, including agents affecting nucleotide metabolism (e.g. Ribavirin, C-c 3 Ado, EICAR) and analogues inhibiting DNA synthesis [e.g. 3'C-methylAdo; Ara-C, Cidofovir (Fig. 1) and its derivatives; cHPMPC and HDP-HPMPC) (Neyts and De Clercq 2003) . Recently, 24 different antiviral agents were tested for their inhibitory activity on the replication in vitro of several poxviruses. Cidofovir and ribavirin may provide the best choices for general use in case of urgency, as both have been accepted previously for clinical use, although for different purposes (Baker et al. 2003) . Plans for large and systematic efforts to look for anti-smallpox agents have been presented (Harrison et al. 2004) .",

RNA capping is essential for viruses and involves several enzymatic reactions: RNA triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase. In several cases, viruses encode their own RNA capping enzymes which may act by mechanisms different from those of the cellular RNA capping apparatus. These differences in specificity should make them attractive targets. Virus-specific capping enzymes have been best characterized in the alphaviruslike superfamily of positive-strand RNA viruses, which includes the arthropod-borne alphaviruses and their distant relatives, the rubella virus and the hepatitis E virus (Ahola and K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen 1995; Magden et al. 2001; K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen and Ahola, 2002) . Various cap analogues have been tested for inhibitory activity (Lampio et al. 1999) . Although some viruses steal caps from cellular RNAs, as described above for influenza endonuclease, other groups of positive and negative strand RNA viruses should possess capping enzymes, many of which remain uncharacterized. As the first example from RNA viruses, the structure of the cap methyltransferase has been described for the flavivirus dengue (Egloff et al. 2002) .",

However, in many cases the mechanisms of membrane association remain poorly understood (Salonen et al. 2004 ). Alphaviruses represent the first example of structurally characterized membrane binding. In the middle of the replicase protein nsP1, there is a 20-amino acid peptide, which is responsible for the binding of the whole replication complex to the cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane and endosomes. The peptide forms an amphipathic alpha helix, with hydrophobic residues embedded within the fatty acid tails while positively charged residues interact with negatively charged polar groups of phospholipids (Lampio et al. 2000; K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen and Ahola, 2002) .",

Many of the early drugs were nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, some of which turned out to be specific for viruses, e.g. acyclovir and its derivatives. Modern virology has provided the tools to study the details of virus replication at the molecular level. The enormous challenge caused by the appearance of HIV has shown that new drugs can be developed, once the scientific community makes a concerted effort to solve the details of the virus replication cycle. Similarly to HIV, the replication of HCV is becoming very well characterized and this knowledge is likely to allow the delivery of drugs which can be used for the treatment of patients in the near future. Systematic studies of the influenza hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins with their sialic acid ligand have yielded compounds which can be used in disease treatment and prevention. The rational approach has also been used in the development of rhinovirus inhibitors for almost 20 years, but without a clear breakthrough, showing the inherent difficulties in this field. Newly emerging and threatening viruses are another area actively targeted in studies of virus inhibitors.",
