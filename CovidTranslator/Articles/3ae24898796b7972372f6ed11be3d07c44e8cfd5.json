It is now well established that a variety of infectious agents, including many types of viruses, are able to spread by the airborne route. It is the capacity of these viruses to survive in the airborne state which results in their aerial dissemination. In view of this, a great deal of work has been conducted to determine which factor(s) promote or retard the survival of infectious viral agents in air (Spendlove and Fannin, 1982, Ijaz, 1985) . A review of the literature revealed a considerable variation in the results of different worhcrs because the laboratory techniques for viral aerobiological work have not been standardized. It has been noted that variations in techniques that may influence the results include: (1) methods of aerosol generation.",

The procedure for the quantitation of RV-14 is briefly as following. Flasks containing confluent monolayers of A-5HeLa cells were infected with 0.33 ml of the virus sample to be plaque assayed. The virus vvas adsorbed for 1 h at 33\u00b0C during which time the flasks were gently shaken at 20-min. intervals to distribute the inoculum over the monolayer evenly.

DEAE-dextran 50 p@mI (Sigma). 30 mM MgCI? (Fisher Certified Reagent) and 0.9% oxoid No. I (Toxoid). The flasks were then piaced in a CQ incubator at 33 \"C. The plaques of RV-14 were ready within '72 h of incubation at which time the cells were mixed with 5 ml of a 4% form01 saline solution and allowed to stand for 24 h at room temperature to get rid of all infectious virus. The agar ovferlay was then carefully removed and the remaining fixed monolayer was stained with a 1% solution of crystal violet to enhance the visibility of plaques which were then counted.",

The property of this nebulizer is that it produces aerosols with an aerodynamic size of fess than 5 km which are of significance for their stability in airborne state and subsequently are capable of being retained in the respiratory tract of the host upon inhalation. After suspending the virus in the appropriate medium it was aerosolized using a h-jet Cohison nebulizer (May. 1973 ) purchased from BGI Inc.. Waltham, MA. A 300-I stainless steel drum (Goldberg et al.. 195X: Mitchell et al., 1968) was used for the storage of the aerosols (Fig.  1) . The drum was rotated at 4 rpm to reduce the toss of the aerosols by sodimentation (Goldberg et al.. 19%) . The temperature inside the drum was kept at 20 ~ti\"C, The drum air containing the virus aerosol was sampled at appropriate intervals using an All Glass Impinger (Tyler and Shipe. f959). A critical vacuum was maintained in all experiments so that the impinger would operate at its design capacity of 5.6 limin. After each experiment the drum was thoroughly flushed with room air to remove all the virus and dye left from the experiment.",

This completely suppressed plaque formation by rotaviruses. However, for titration of the rotavirus contained in the mixtures, it was necessary to neutralize the poliovirus with the specific hyperimmune serum (1:lOOO) first and then perform the plaque assay with a trypsin-containing overiay. Poliovirus could also form countable plaques in L-132 cells and in mixtures containing this virus and coronavirus, hyperimmune antiserum was used to neutralize poliovirus before the plaque assay of coronavirus. To determine the number of poliovirus PFU in such mixtures, no special pretreatment of the samples was required since poliovirus could form plaques in 48 h at 37\u00b0C and 6 days of incubation at 33\u00b0C was necessary for the development of countable plaques by the coronavirus.",

Since the half-life of both dyes and radioisotopes were fairly comparable we decided to include one of the dyes in subsequent experiments.",

            "text": "sampier (Anderson, 1958) clearly demonstrated that there were no major differences in the size of the ae.rosols being generated and aged at the 3 RH levels. The data generated in these experiments atso showed that the aerosolized particles containing the dye and the virus under test belonged in the same range. However, a slight shift in the recovery of particles from stages 4 to 5 and 6 was observed in the experiments carried out at medium and low RH compared with high RH. These results correlate with the results of earlier workers (Couch el al.. 1965) . This could be due to the fact that the rate of evaporation is generally higher at low and medium than at high RH, which is further enhanced by high tcmperature (Elazhary and Derbyshire, 1977) . It has been shown that biological aerosols are hygroscopic in nature, i.e.. under different environmental conditions of RH and temperature they lose or gain moisture (Knight+ I973). Thus, smaller virus-c~~ntai~~il~g aerosols although containing less virus would disseminate widely, and upon inhalation in the respiratory tract of the host will have better chances of being retained due to their hygroscopicity.The results of the present study together with our earlier work (Sattar ct al.. 1983 (Sattar ct al.. , 1984 ljaz et al., 1984 , 1985a revealed that the capacity of rotavirus to survive in the airborne state is influence by RH. In this regard, the RH in the midrange was found to be more favorable compared to the other 2 RH levels tested. In contrast to this, other non-enveloped viruses such as polio (Harper. 1961); adeno (Miller and Artenstein. 1967) ; reo (Adams et al.. 1982) and rhinoviruses (Karim et al,, 1985) have been found to survive better at high RH levels. Therefore the behavior of rotaviruses appears to resemble that of enveloped viruses (Harper, 1961) . In contrast to this, work carried out with other enveloped (HCVI229E) and non-enveloped (polio and rhino) viruses under the same experimental set up correlate with our and other workers findings (Harper. 19hI; Songer. 1967; Elazhary and Derbyshire. 1979a .h: Sattar et al., 1984 : ijaz et al., 1984 , 1985a ,b,c: Grim et al., 1985 . The methods developed to study the airborne survival of these viruses should be useful to examine the aerobiology of other viruses, which would help us in understanding the genesis of outbreaks due to these viruses and in instituting proper measures for their prevention and control.
