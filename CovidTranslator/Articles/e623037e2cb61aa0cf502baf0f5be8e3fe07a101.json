As IPCs, they produce large amounts of type I and type III interferons (IFNs), have a lymphoid shape with a plasma cell morphology and have a pattern of cell surface markers (including lymphoid markers) that suggests a different ontogeny to cDCs.

More recently, the identification of E2-2 as an essential and specific transcriptional regulator for pDC development has provided the undisputable evidence that pDCs develop along a distinct pathway 12 .

Following activation, pDCs lose both their plasmacytoid morphology and their ability to produce type I IFNs, and differentiate into cells with a dendritic morphology and the capacity to prime naive T cells. Thus, the 'plasmacytoid' and the 'dendritic' state of these cells are morphologically and functionally distinct, indicating that the term pDC is in fact a misnomer.

The preferential use of these two TLRs represents a similarity between pDCs and resting B cells. TLR7 and TLR9 recognize RNA and DNA viruses, respectively, as well as nucleic acids released by dying cells in pathological conditions. These nucleic acids are often associated with cationic proteins or other chaperones, or bound by immunoglobulins in immune complexes that interact with membrane Fc receptors (FcRs). Through TLR7 and TLR9, pDCs participate in innate resistance to viral and bacterial infections and promote tissue repair following injury, but they can also mediate immunopathology.

These cytokines activate pDCs to differentiate into mature DCs that have the ability to stimulate naive T cells but no longer produce type I IFNs. In vitro studies have yielded interesting data on how IL-3 and GM-CSF activate pDCs to drive T helper 2 (T H 2) and T H 1 cell responses, respectively.

An elegant recent study showed that abolishing antigen presentation by pDCs increased autoimmune inflammation in the brain 24 ; however, the net effect of pDCs in this model still remains to be established. Given that pDCs are poor antigen presenters in the absence of activation, and that the products of their activation (type I IFNs) are potent adjuvants, it appears likely that pDCs would facilitate protective immunity rather than tolerance. pDCs seem to mainly contribute to immune function by producing type I IFNs. However, other leukocytes and non-immune cells can also produce type I IFNs -why you think we need a cell that is dedicated to this type of response?",

This can be best accomplished through constant patrolling by recirculating cells equipped with unique detection and signalling mechanisms.

Cohen at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel, and carried out postdoctoral training with Philip Leder at Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. He is currently an associate professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Columbia University, New York, USA. His lab is broadly interested in the regulation of haematopoiesis, stem cell function and dendritic cell development and homeostasis.Giorgio Trinchieri has directed the Cancer and Inflammation Program at the National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA, since 2006. He trained in medicine at the University of Turin, Italy, and at the Basel Institute of Immunology, Switzerland. In 1989, his group at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, discovered interleukin-12 (IL-12), and he is interested in the interplay between inflammation or innate resistance and adaptive immunity, and in the role of IL-12 and other proinflammatory cytokines in the regulation of haematopoiesis, innate resistance and immunity. He has been involved in the early discovery and characterization of plasmacytoid dendritic cells both in humans and in the mouse. His most recent work is focused on the role of inflammation in cancer and the role of the microbiota in the local and systemic regulation of inflammation.Michel Gilliet is a professor and chairman of the Department of Dermatology at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. He trained in medicine at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and was later a postdoctoral fellow with Yong-Jun Liu at the DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, California, USA, and an associate professor at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, USA. His lab is currently exploring the roles of dendritic cells and antimicrobial peptides in inflammatory and autoimmune responses in the skin. Franck Barrat obtained his Ph.D. in immunology working on the identification of genetic defects underlying immunodeficiency syndromes in children at the Necker Hospital in Paris, France. After postdoctoral work at the DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, California, USA, where he identified novel approaches to generate regulatory T cells, he moved to Dynavax Technologies in Berkeley, California. His main focus there has been the role of nucleic acid recognition during immune responses, with particular emphasis on the role of Toll-like receptors in autoimmune situations such as lupus or skin inflammation. Marco Colonna is a professor of pathology, immunology and medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, USA. After obtaining his M.D. degree from the University of Parma, Italy, and completing his postdoctoral training at Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA, he established his first independent laboratory at the Basel Institute for Immunology, Switzerland. He focuses on receptors mediating innate immune responses; his accomplishments include identifying the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors and defining HLA polymorphisms as their inhibitory ligands, as well as discovering the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) receptor families. In 1999, he determined that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play a crucial role in type I interferon responses. pDCs and their role in host responses to pathogens, autoimmunity and cancer continue to be a major focus of his laboratory. pDCs have been implicated in the differentiation of almost every type of CD4 + T cell, including T H 1, T H 2, T H 17, T H 22 and regulatory T (T Reg ) cells",
