However, training of this kind is rarely available on an organized level and is mainly performed in a traditional laboratory culture of individual training. The steady rise in the number of people who work in BSL-3/4 laboratories may inflate the potential for accidents, as has been seen in the United States in recent years. Therefore, as an addition to the individual training, organized training is absolutely necessary and indeed has been announced as obligatory in the United States 3 . The European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) is a European intergovernmental framework that allows the coordination of nationally funded research. COST Action B28, ' Array technologies for BSL-3 and BSL-4 pathogens' , has created and financed a new training school G\u00d6ttingen for laboratory scientists, providing a focused introduction to the principles and regulations that are important for work in a BSL-3/4 environment. In the European Union, there seems to be just one comparable -but commercial -course, offered by the Health Protection Agency in the United Kingdom.",

The BSL-3 facilities at the Institute of Virology in G\u00f6ttingen allow the simultaneous training of 10 students. Training for the BSL-4 level with a group of this size is impossible for security and infrastructure reasons, but the BLS-3 course provides at least a good, basic practical introduction to the principles of working at BSL-3 level, many of which are also adhered to in a BSL-4 environment.",

A general problem in all countries seems to be the difficulty in convincing biosafety officers to accept proof of biosafety that has not yet been cast into official regulations. However, these regulations cannot cover all aspects of working with new organisms. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus outbreak in 2003 can be seen as a showcase for this dilemma 4 . The notion that scientists who work in BSL-3/4 laboratories cannot be trusted seems contradictory to the fact that these scientists, working with highly contagious and pathogenic agents, have an eminent interest in their own health and safety. To improve their understanding of the practical aspects and needs of BSL-3/4 scientists, biosafety officers should also be asked to participate in this type of course.",

A major effort across the European Union should therefore be to build a flexible framework that will accept biosafety evidence that is generated at the level of local laboratories. There is a need for a consensus on how proof of biosafety should be shown and documented, in order to sustain and not stifle a flexible capacity to deal with new and well-known pathogens. Tighter regulations issued in response to the green paper on bio-preparedness 5 may blur or bias the perception of biosafety necessities, which might make working in BSL-3/4 laboratories close to impossible. This could essentially impede all bio-preparedness actions in the event of unexpected events in the public domain.",
