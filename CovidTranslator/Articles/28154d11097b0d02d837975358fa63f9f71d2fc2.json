The innate immune response is rapid and recruits effector molecules and phagocytic cells to the site of infection through the release of cytokines. Pulmonary surfactant provides early defense from viral infection. Surfactant proteins A and D are members of the collectin family that can bind to the surface of a number of pathogens including RSV. The virus is thus opsonized and capable of binding to complement and receptors on phagocytic cells (neutrophils and macrophages), eosinophils, and natural killer cells. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the most important of these receptors. They are present on epithelial cells and phagocytic cells and recognize distinctive nonhuman pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Although their precise role is still being elucidated, TLRs are important receptors to the innate and adaptive immune responses to RSV. TLR2 and TLR4 are receptors for surfactant proteins A and D, both of which bind to RSV. TLR4 and CD14 have been shown to be co-receptors for the Figure 4 Pathogenesis of RSV bronchiolitis. RSV first infects ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, secreted by infected epithelial cells and macrophages, attract inflammatory cells and cause inflammation and bronchoconstriction in the airway. The predominant inflammatory cells in the airway are neutrophils and alveolar macrophages. Dendritic cells are the main antigen-presenting cells that stimulate T-lymphocyte function. Neutrophil survival is prolonged and IL-9 secretion promotes mucus production. CD4 \u00fe T-helper lymphocytes may be skewed to produce proinflammatory (Th2) cytokines.

The cell-mediated response is composed of the CD8 \u00fe cytotoxic T lymphocytes and CD4 \u00fe T-helper lymphocytes. Cytotoxic lymphocytes are important in both recovery from and the pathogenesis of RSV bronchiolitis. They promote clearance of RSV from the lungs but also cause pulmonary injury. Functional studies in T-lymphocyte-depleted mice demonstrated prolonged RSV replication, yet no overt evidence of illness. CD4 \u00fe T-helper cells have traditionally been subdivided further according to the cytokine profiles they secrete: T-helper-1 (Th1) cells produce interferon gamma (IFN-g) and other antiviral cytokines. Th2 cells produce cytokines that induce eosinophil proliferation, and the release of leukotrienes and IgE antibodies leading to an enhanced inflammatory response. The idea that RSV bronchiolitis might be a Th2-type disease, and that this may explain airway obstruction and postbronchiolitic wheeze, has somewhat limited evidence to support it. Multiple factors are more likely to influence the T-lymphocyte response to RSV infection.",

When natural RSV infection occurred in children given the vaccine, 80% of these children were hospitalized and two children died. Interpretation of the trial results was hampered by the lack of a small animal model, in which vaccine-enhanced disease could be studied. It is now apparent that other vaccine formulations are also capable of stimulating inappropriate immune responses to RSV. Therefore, comprehensive studies using animal models are essential before any further human vaccine trials are undertaken and are key to our understanding of the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis.",

The analysis of cells obtained by BAL may be helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. The cellular analysis of the BAL fluid (BALF) relies on an accurate identification and differential counting of the cells obtained. Universal standards are not available; consequently, each institution should ensure that the various readers of BALF samples have been properly trained in cellular analysis. Using a standard technique for performing the BAL and handling the sample will also reduce variability. To explore the possible role for BALF analysis in the",
