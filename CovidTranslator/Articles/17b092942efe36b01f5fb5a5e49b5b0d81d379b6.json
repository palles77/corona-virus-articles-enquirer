Guidance provided during the 2009 novel H1N1 pandemic expanded on earlier recommendations, emphasizing the need to keep staff in all health care settings healthy to maintain services. Methods: New York State hospitals with emergency departments having more than 1,000 visits annually were invited to participate; 23 hospitals participated. Health care workers, unit managers, and hospital managers were interviewed regarding knowledge, beliefs, and practices of respiratory protection. Interviewees were observed donning and doffing an N-95 respirator as they normally would during patient care. Written RPPs for each hospital were evaluated. Results: The majority of the hospitals surveyed had implemented an RPP, although unawareness of the policies and practices, as well as inadequacies in education and training exist among health care workers. Conclusion: Health care workers and other hospital employees may be unnecessarily exposed to airborne infectious diseases. Having an RPP ensures safe and effective use of N-95 respirators and will help prevent avoidable exposure to disease during a pandemic, protecting the health care workforce and patients alike.",

Figures were generated using NYS hospital discharge data. 3 The increases seen in 2009 placed an additional burden on the health care system, emphasizing the need to keep staff in all health care settings healthy to maintain services. The CDC released interim guidance on infection control measures to prevent transmission of the 2009 H1N1 virus in health care settings. 4 The guidance expanded on earlier recommendations and emphasized a comprehensive approach that includes all persons whose occupational activities involve contact with patients or potentially contaminated material in a health care setting. 4 The guidance indicated that the 2009 influenza virus was transmitted from person to person through close contact in ways similar to other influenza viruses, although studies indicated that H1N1 may be spread via smaller airborne particles. 4 As a result, appropriate airborne infectious disease precautions were recommended.",

When asked during interviews about the selection of appropriate respiratory protection based on precautions (droplet, influenza, airborne) and task (close contact, aerosol-generating procedure), results were wide-ranging (Fig 3) . These respirator selection requirements are based on Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee guidance. 6 The majority of respondents reported that they had access to the model and size for which they received a fit test (97.4%). We observed that participants performed well in positioning the N-95 properly on the face (92.2%), properly placing the straps (87.8%), properly forming the nose clip (85.2%), and having no facial hair under the seal (93.0%). Only 36.5% of participants performed the seal check, which is imperative in determining whether a proper fit has been achieved. The respirators were properly removed using the straps 65.2% of the time (Table 4) .",

Because the project is voluntary, selection bias is a concern because those who choose to participate are concerned with proper respiratory protection and therefore may be more likely to practice it than those who did not participate. Convenience sampling was employed to interview HCWs, as not to interfere with patient care. This nonprobabilistic method can result in an under-or over-representation of the population of interest. Site visits were conducted during regular weekdays and took approximately 4 hours to complete. Because of the time frame and limited resources, it was not possible to interview workers during evening and night shifts. Whereas HCWs were cooperative in participating in the respirator demonstration, we were unable to observe N-95 use during patient care activities. Therefore, we could not accurately assess whether proper control measures were undertaken when a patient with airborne, influenza, or contact precautions was identified. Although the primary focus of the study was on EDs, they can become busy quickly, and it was not always possible to obtain the number of interviews desired. Although these limitations make it difficult to generalize the findings, the surveys were a useful tool in evaluating the knowledge, beliefs, and practices of hospital personnel.

Although better than the national average, this is still below the \"Healthy People 2020\" goal of 90% coverage among HCWs. 9, 11, 12 Making vaccines available to HCWs at no cost, along with other initiatives implemented by hospitals, have helped to increase vaccination coverage. 9 Many managers and HCWs surveyed also reported the success of initiatives such as mobile vaccination carts and mandatory declinations.",

Another recommendation we made was to verify that employees knew what model/size N-95 respirator for which they had been fit tested. The majority of ED staff was aware of the model/size they needed (because they use N-95 protection frequently), but staff on other units (medical/surgical, intensive care unit) would sometimes state they were unsure of the model/size for which they had been fitted because they use respiratory protection much less frequently. As a possible solution, we recommended that staff be given a sticker at the time of fit testing with their model/size N-95 information written on it.
