Additionally, when laboratory animals are used as models for infectious disease studies, exposure to microbial pathogens presents a threat to human health. Also, with the recognition of emerging diseases, some of which are zoonotic, constant vigilance and surveillance of laboratory animals for zoonotic diseases are still required.",

Since 1980, smallpox has been considered to be eradicated on a worldwide basis by the World Health Organization, and the concomitant outbreaks of a smallpox-like disease in monkeys and humans have now been ascribed to monkeypox virus (Breman et al., 1980) . a. Monkeypox i. Reservoir and incidence. Monkeypox is an Orthopoxvirus causing sporadic cases of a human disease in Africa that mimics smallpox. Natural outbreaks of monkeypox have also been recorded in nonhuman primates in the wild and in laboratory settings (Fenner, 1990; CDCP, 1997) . The virus appears to be naturally occurring in animals only on the continent of Africa, although Asian, African, and South American nonhuman primates are susceptible to infection (Fenner, 1990) . Most of the infections in captive nonhuman primates have involved Asian macaques (Fenner, 1990) . Recently, squirrels of the genera Funisciurus and Heliosciurus and nonhuman primates have been identified as hosts and significant reservoirs of the disease (Jerzek and Fenner, 1988) .",

Humans develop a similar pattern of infection, manifesting acute illness, fever, chills, headache, myalgia, and anorexia with progressive deterioration to vomiting, abdominal pain, sore throat, and bloody diarrhea. Although less virulent than the Sudan or Zaire strains of Ebola virus in nonhuman primates, Ebola-Reston produced a hemorrhagic disease in macaques involving multiple organ systems, resulting in death in 8-14 days. Clinical disease was not recognized in animal technicians who developed filovirus-specific serum antibodies associated with the disease outbreak in macaques due to Ebola-Reston (CDC, 1990; Dalgard et aL, 1992) .",

The hantaviruses are widely distributed in nature among wild rodent reservoirs, but unlike other members of the family, they are usually not transmitted by insect vectors (Schmaljohn and Hjelle, 1997) . At least 14 viruses are recognized in the genus, and the severity of the disease produced depends on the virulence of the virus involved (LeDuc, 1987; Schmaljohn and Hjelle, 1997) . Viruses producing HFRS are prevalent in southeastern Asia, Japan, and focally throughout Eurasia; whereas variants producing a less severe form of the disease, known as nephropathia endemica, occur throughout Scandinavia, Europe, and western portions of the former Soviet Union. An outbreak of hantavirus infection resulting in numerous deaths in adults from fatal hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first recognized in the United States (Schmaljohn and Hjelle, 1997; CDCP-NIH, 1999) . Since this initial outbreak, cases of HPS have been reported from 30 states, and about three-quarters of the patients have been from rural areas.",

The recent cases that have occurred in the laboratory animal facility environment have involved infected laboratory rats. In this environment, the possibility of transmitting the infection from animal to animal by the transplantation of cells or tissues should also be considered (Kawamata et al., 1987) .

Early serological studies indicated that the same, or a closely related virus, was involved in five of six outbreaks studied and that the etiologic agent had a close antigenic relationship with LCMV (Stevensen et al., 1990 (Stevensen et al., , 1991 . Subsequently, LCMV was shown to be the etiologic agent for callitrichid hepatitis through cDNA genome analysis (Stevensen et al., 1995) . Rodent infestations are common in zoos, and mice, as known carriers of LCMV, are the probable source of infection in these outbreaks. Moreover, it had been a common practice in some facilities to supplement the diets of tamarins and marmosets with suckling mice (Richter et al., 1984) , a prime source for the infectious agent. Two veterinarians involved in the care of infected callitrichids became seropositive to the agent but did not develop clinical signs of disease (Adams, 1995) . Nevertheless, the wide geographic distribution of the outbreaks of callitrichid hepatitis underscores the need to better understand the public health implications of LCMV as a human pathogen as well.",

            "text": "Infection in humans may be by parental inoculation, inhalation, or contamination of mucous membranes or broken skin with infectious tissues or fluids from infected animals. Airborne transmission is well documented. In human LCMV infections associated with infected pet hamsters, the infection rate correlated with cage type and location in the household. Open wire cages were correlated with the highest rate of infection, whereas deep boxes and aquariums were associated with a lower human infection rate. Similarly, cage placement in an area of high human activity was associated with infection, but remotely located cages away from areas of frequent human activity (e.g., the basement) did not result in infection of occupants (Biggar et al., 1975) . Also, infections are known to occur in individuals who have not had direct physical contact with infected hamsters but who had simply entered the room housing the animals . These findings suggest that airborne transmission plays an important role in human infection. iii. Clinical signs. Humans usually develop a flulike illness characterized by fever, myalgia, headache, and malaise following an incubation period of 1-3 weeks (Table I) . However, there can be more serious manifestations of the disease in patients, including maculopapular rash, lymphadenopathy, meningoencephalitis, and rarely, orchitis, arthritis, and epicarditis (Johnson, 1990 ). Central nervous system involvement has resulted in death in several cases. The virus may pose a special risk during pregnancy because of potential infection of the human fetus (Wright et al., 1997) . Wright et al. (1997) reported 26 cases in human infants, with LCMV confirmed serologically over a 2year period in a major U.S. medical center. These infants presented with ocular abnormalities, macrocephaly, and microcephaly. Fifty percent of the mothers reported having had illnesses compatible with LCMV infection, and over half reported exposures to rodents during their pregnancies. Intravenous ribavirin therapy significantly reduces mortality in patients infected with Lassa fever virus and may be of some benefit in patients with severe LCMV infections (Andrei and DeClerq, 1993) .",

Antibody is detectable using an IFA approximately 2 weeks following the onset of illness. Prevention of this disease in the laboratory is achieved through the periodic serological surveillance of new animals with inadequate disease profiles and resident animal colonies at risk, using ELISA and IFA tests. Screening all tumors and cell lines intended for animal passage for the presence of LCMV is another crucial element in the program to prevent the introduction of LCMV into established animal colonies. The elimination of ectoparasites and insect vectors in animal facilities as part of the overall scheme for disease prevention and control would also be prudent measures for the control of LCMV. There are many herpesviruses of nonhuman primates and other animal species that might be studied as laboratory animals, but CHV-1 stands alone as a documented hazard with devastating potential for humans working in the laboratory animal facility environment. Among the many other nonhuman primate herpesviruses, Herpesvirus saimiri will replicate in human tissues and is classified as an oncogenic virus by the National Cancer Institute, and H. tamarinus has been shown to produce skin pustules, fever, and nonfatal encephalitis in humans (Adams, 1995; Mansfield and King, 1998) .

First described in 1933 by Gay and Holden, B virus produces a life-threatening disease of humans that has resulted in several fatalities within the past decade (CDC, 1987 (CDC, , 1989 (CDC, , 1991 CDCP, 1998) . In macaques, B virus produces a mild clinical disease similar to human H. simplex virus infection. Duringprimary infection, macaques develop lingual and/or labial vesicles or ulcers that generally heal within a 1-to 2-week period; keratoconjunctivitis or corneal ulcer may also be noted. The virus persists latently in the trigeminal and genital ganglia of the macaque, and reactivation of viral shedding from peripheral sites in asymptomatic animals subjected to physical or psychological stressors or treated with immunosuppressive agents is known to occur. The infection is transmitted between macaques by virus-laden secretions through close contact involving primarily the oral, conjunctival, and genital mucous membranes (Weigler et aL, 1995) .",

Seroconversion to B virus among wild-caught rhesus monkeys also indicates that eventually 100% of the newly trapped individuals acquire the infection. Consequently, B virus should be considered endemic among Asian monkeys of the genus Macaca unless these animals have been obtained from specific breeding colonies known to be B virus-free. Several species of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys other than macaques are known to succumb to fatal B virus infection, but only macaques are known to harbor B virus naturally (Holmes et al., 1995) . Eight of 25 langurs and 4 of 6 proboscis monkeys were seropositive to B virus in a survey, indicating that these Asian Old World monkey species may also be potential reservoirs (Kalter et al., 1997) .",

Additional provisions for protection against B virus exposure via ocular splash were adopted following the death of a young woman exposed by this route (CDCP, 1998) . Readers should refer to these sources or other detailed reviews before engaging in studies involving macaques or developing institutional programs for the prevention and control of B virus among monkey handlers (Adams, 1995; Holmes et al., 1995) . Briefly, these recommendations emphasize the need for nonhuman primate handlers to conform fully with a written comprehensive personal protective equipment (PPE) program based on a thorough hazard assessment of all work procedures, potential routes of exposure, and potential adverse health outcomes (CDCP, 1998) . Approaches to hazard assessment and the development of occupational health and safety programs for research animal facilities have been reviewed extensively in other sources (Committee on Occupational Health and Safety in Research Animal Facilities, 1997). Protective clothing, including leather gloves or long-sleeved garments for hand and arm protection and protective goggles designe d for splash protection, along with a mask, are considered essential equipment to protect other mucous membranes from exposure to macaque secretions. The use of a face shield is insufficient as the sole method for protection against ocular exposure because droplet splashes to the head may drain into the eyes and infectious materials may enter via the gap along the margins of the shield. Importantly, personal eyeglasses are not considered PPE. The use of latex gloves alone for hand protection should be reserved for the handling of monkeys under full chemical restraint. Chemical restraint or specialized restraining devices should be used whenever possible for nonhuman primates to reduce personnel injuries.",

            "text": "i. Reservoir and incidence. Rabies occurs worldwide with the exception of a few countries, generally island nations, and other regions that have excluded the disease through animal importation and control programs and the aid of geographic barriers. Rabies virus infects all mammals; however, the main reservoirs are wild and domestic canines, cats, skunks, raccoons, bats, and other biting animals. In the United States the dog, cat, and other domestic animals have declined in importance as sources of exposure in confirmed human cases of the disease (CDCP, 1999) . According to one study however, 18.4% of 3329 domestic animals that were reportedly exposed to rabiespositive wild animals are unvaccinated (Wilson et al., 1997) . The disease historically has not been a problem in the laboratory animal facility setting. Among the rodent and lagomorph species maintained in the laboratory, the wild-caught groundhog and rabbit appear to represent a risk of transmitting rabies (Childs et al., 1997; Karp et al., 1999) . However, because the incidence of rabies in wildlife in the United States has risen, the possibility of rabies transmission to dogs, cats, or other species having uncertain vaccination histories and originating from an uncontrolled environment must be considered. In addition, rabies-susceptible wildlife species studied in the field or introduced into the laboratory for special research investigations could also have the potential to harbor rabies virus. In the skunk and some bat species, rabies virus strains appear to have adapted to growth in the lung, producing respiratory tract infections, and the virus is spread via the aerosol route (Johnson, 1989) . Of the human cases of rabies in the United States reported since 1990, most have involved bat-associated viral variants; and the predominant strain has been associated with two insectivorous bat species, Eastern pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus subflavus) and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) (CDCP, 1999) . Another rabieslike lyssavirus causing fatal human encephalitis has also been recently isolated from bats in Australia, a country believed to have a rabies-free status, further emphasizing the bat as a potential reservoir for these agents (Anonymous, 1997; Gerrard, 1997) .",

The incubation period in humans is ordinarily 1-3 months but may vary from 9 days to over 8 months. During the prodromal stage lasting 2-4 days, patients experience a period of apprehension and develop headache, malaise, and fever. An abnormal, indefinite sensation at the site of a prior animal bite wound is the first specific symptom. Patients may also develop intermittent periods of excitation, nervousness, or anxiety interspersed with quiet periods when the mental state appears normal. Further progression of the disease is marked by paresis or paralysis, inability to swallow, and the related hydrophobia, delirium, convulsions, and coma. Rabies produces an almost invariably fatal acute viral encephalomyelitis, with death due to respiratory paralysis. encephalitic signs. Any wild animal that has bitten someone should be submitted for rabies examination in a manner that permits definitive identification of the species for epidemiologic purposes if the species is not already known.",

General guidelines for proper administration of rabies postexposure prophylaxis (RPEP) treatments have been published by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Guidelines stipulate that unvaccinated persons potentially exposed to rabies should be treated with human rabies immune globulin and a 5-dose series of rabies vaccine administered (CDCP, 1999) . Surprisingly, one study suggests that the use of RPEP is often inappropriate (Moran et al., 2000) . The authors urge the routine use of current published guidelines, physician education, and improved coordination with public health officials. The control of rabies through vaccination programs, animal control measures, and rabies surveillance efforts is an equally important factor in the prevention of rabies cases in the domestic animal population and therefore in humans. Whenever possible, animals brought into the laboratory should have histories that preclude their exposure to rabies or assure that they have been vaccinated for this disease. However, due to the potential for a long incubation in the natural history of the disease, the types of animal models utilized, or the prospect of vaccination failures, most institutions are likely to encounter situations where a rabies-free environment cannot be assured adequately. Thus, preexposure immunization to rabies should be available to personnel working in high-risk categories, such as veterinarians, people who are working with or involved in the care of high-risk or inadequately characterized animals, and field biologists who work in rabies-endemic areas.",

Also, there are other natural hepadnavirus infections of animals (woodchuck, ground squirrel, and duck) that are used as animal models of HBV infection, but none are transmissible to humans (Adams, 1995) . The chimpanzee has been used as an experimental model for the study of hepatitis C and D viruses. Thus, the concern for hepatitis B, C, and D as zoonoses is minimal in the laboratory animal facility environment except where these agents are being used in experimental animal studies. In these cases, personnel should adhere to appropriate precautions when handling nonhuman primates.",

These pigs have been reported to appear clinically normal but developed viremia, positive serology, and microscopic signs of hepatic disease.

Notably, both HIV-1 and HIV-2 (human immunodeficiency virus) are known to have originated as zoonotic infections on the continent of Africa from the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys), respectively (Chen et al., 1996; Gao et al., 1999) . These findings have heightened the concerns about zoonotic retroviral transmission, particularly in connection with the use of nonhuman primates as potential xenograft donors to humans requiring organ transplantation. Similar concerns have been raised about the pig as a donor for xenotransplants to humans because the porcine endogenous retrovirus has been demonstrated to grow in human cells in vitro (Wilson et al., 1998) . However, although there are numerous retrovirus infections of wild, laboratory, and domestic animal species, the transmission of these agents from their natural host to humans under laboratory conditions has been documented in only a few cases, both involving nonhuman primates as source species. Further discussion herein is limited to these cases, and the reader should refer to Mansfield and King (1998) for an authoritative review of the retroviral diseases of nonhuman primates.",

Vertical transmission may be by sexual contact, as seroconversion to SIV parallels sexual maturity. Direct inoculation of open wounds or mucous membranes with infectious secretions during other activities such as fighting may also play a role, but airborne transmission is regarded as unlikely (Lairmore et al., 1989) . The blood, secretions, and tissues of SIV-infected monkeys should be presumed to be infectious for persons potentially exposed to these materials. Two human cases of seroconversion to SIV associated with known exposure incidents have been recognized (CDC, 1992b; Khabbaz et al., 1992) , and a blind serological survey of other personnel working with SIV has identified perhaps an additional three seropositive individuals (CDC, 1992a). The possible inclusion of the aforementioned cases of known SIV exposure and the cross-reactivity of SIV and HIV-2 in the assay employed confounded the interpretation of this survey (CDC, 1992a) . In the first case, the individual's skin was punctured accidentally with a needle contaminated by the blood of an infected macaque. In the second case, a laboratory worker who had dermatitis on the hands and forearms and was under treatment with corticosteroids handled SIV-infected blood specimens without wearing gloves. The pattern of seroreactivity suggested the possibility of infection in the second case, and SIV infection was documented subsequently by PCR techniques (Khabbaz et al., 1994) .",

The transmission of simian foamy viruses to humans accidentally exposed or occupationally exposed to nonhuman primates has been reported (Neuman-Haeflin et al., 1993; Heneine et al., 1998) . In the case of occupational exposure, 4 of 231 individuals surveyed serologically were positive, and proviral DNA detection and viral isolation were used to confirm the infection (Heneine et al., 1998) . In 1 human case, the simian foamy virus originated from African green monkeys; and in the other 3 cases, baboons served as the source. Clinical disease in humans has not resulted in any of these cases, and it is suggested that the virus persists in humans in a state of latency following accidental infection (Schweizer et al., 1997) .

Measles virus is a member of the genus Morbillivirus, which is known to cause infection in a wide variety of Old and New World nonhuman primate species (Mansfield and King, 1998) . Humans serve as the reservoir with nonhuman primates becoming infected through contact with human populations with endemic measles. The disease spreads rapidly through infected nonhuman primate colonies, often with devastating consequences, and a 100% seroconversion rate to measles is common in wild-caught nonhuman primate populations within several weeks of capture. A recent serological survey in nonhuman primates from miscellaneous sources has indicated that in three macaque species commonly used in biomedical research, between 45 and 73% of the animals were seropositive for measles virus, but that less than 10% of the squirrel monkeys and marmosets surveyed were seropositive (Kalter et al., 1997) . This finding possibly reflects the fact that these New World monkey species are more vulnerable and less likely to survive the disease than macaques. With the current emphasis on and success of domestic nonhuman primate production, it has become more likely that institutions will develop large populations of susceptible nonhuman primates that could contract measles and then transmit the disease to susceptible humans, as previously reported (Roberts et al., 1988) .",

Vaccination for measles should be assured for all handlers of nonhuman primates.

The acute febrile disease is usually characterized by general malaise, headache, rash, and chills, with signs ranging from mild to severe. An encephalitic syndrome can also occur (Mushatt and Hyslop, 1991) . In one report, 25% of 180 patients with the disease had delirium, stupor, or coma. Fortunately, these findings resolve with lowering of the febrile response. Fatality rate for all ages is about 2% but increases with age. Proper antibiotic therapy is the most effective measure to prevent morbidity or mortality due to rickettsial infections.

Currently, serological diagnosis is accomplished by ELISA and RIA; however, the IFA technique remains the most commonly used. Unfortunately, this test cannot distinguish epidemic from endemic typhus. The CDC considers a fourfold rise in titer detected by any technique (except Weil-Felix) as evidence of rickettsial infection. Complement fixation titer of 1:16 or greater in a single serum sample from a patient with clinically compatible signs is also considered diagnostic (McDade and Fishbein, 1988) .

The prevalence of the infection among sheep is high throughout the United States, and sheep have been the primary species associated with disease outbreaks, including those occurring in research animal facilities (Asher, 1989) .

The organism is highly infectious with possibly as few as 10 organisms inducing infection (CDCP-NIH, 1999) . The primary method of transmission is through infectious aerosols. The organism produces a sporelike form that is resistant to desiccation and persists in the environment for long periods of time, contributing to the widespread dissemination of infectious aerosols and resulting in infections miles from the original organism source (Franz et al., 1997; Tissot-Dupont et al., 1999) . The importance of these factors was illustrated in outbreaks of the disease associated with the use of pregnant sheep in research facilities in the United States (Bernard et al., 1982) . In these outbreaks, personnel who did not have direct contact with infected sheep but who worked along the transport routes for these animals became serologically positive for Q fever (Bernard et al., 1982; Reimer, 1993) . Also, five of nine laundry workers without direct sheep contact but who processed linens soiled during sheep surgery developed serological evidence of infection.",

Whenever possible, male or nonpregnant sheep should be used in research programs; however, many research applications specifically call for the use of pregnant animals. Several commercial vendors now supply sheep from flocks that have not had serological evidence of infection for an extended period. Although serological status is not a useful indicator of organism shedding in individual sheep, many institutions have elected to use these animals, reasoning that cumulative and consistent negative Q fever serology on a herd basis provides a reasonably strong assurance of Q fever-free status. Advances in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods have improved the sensitivity of C. burnetii detection over that of the antigen capture ELISA, as well as improved the speed, safety, and convenience of the assay. The PCR method may offer some hope that the potential for organism shedding could be assessed on an individual animal basis to minimize the potential risk of Q fever outbreaks in animal facilities (Lorenz et al., 1998; Yanase et al., 1998) .",

Although rabies is the most serious public health threat from bites and scratches, the risk of bacterial infection from dog bites is lower (approximately 3-18%) than that from cat bites, which is reported to be approximately 28-80% (Weber and Hansen, 1991) . It is estimated that 400,000 persons in the United Statesare bitten or scratched by cats annually. According to one report, approximately 40,000 rat bites are recorded annually (Committee on Urban Pest Management, 1980).

Most of the patients are under 20 years of age. It is now known that cat fleas are infected with B. henselae. It is suspected that the organism is shed in the feces of the flea and can result in the transmission of the organism from cat to cat and from cat to human via mucous membrane or skin contact. Subsequently there is self-inoculation by scratching the flea bite, or alternatively by having the contaminated claws or teeth of cats inoculate the organism into traumatized skin. Importantly, several surveys have shown that cats can be chronically infected with B. henselae, with the organism capable of being isolated from blood of asymptomatic cats over an extended period of time (Koehler et al., 1994) .",

A primary lesion will develop in 50% of the cases about 10 days after a cat bite or scratch; the erythematous pustule will usually persist for 1-2 weeks (Fig. 3 ). A regional lymphadenopathy develops 14 days after the initial lesion in most cases. Lymphadenitis regresses in about 6 weeks, with 30-50% of the nodes becoming suppurative. Of the approximately 65% of people who develop systemic illness, fever and malaise are the symptoms most often noted. Occasionally observed are generalized lymphadenopathy, thrombocytopenia, encephalitis, osteolytic lesions, and erythema nodosum. The disease is benign, and most patients recover spontaneously without sequelae within 2 months, although lymphadenopathy can persist up to a year. In immunocompromised individuals, CSD is manifested by an unusual vascular growth seen on the skin and given the name bacillary epithelioid angiomatosis (LeBoit et al., 1988; Kemper et al., 1990) .

Since 1924 Since -1925 , when a plague epidemic ravaged Los Angeles, neither urban plague nor rat-borne plague has been diagnosed in the United States (Craven and Barnes, 1991) . All reported cases since then have occurred in states located west of the 101st meridian. (Kaufman et al., 1980; Rosner, 1987) . Cricetid rodents, such as the wood rat, are occasionally cited as reservoir hosts. The oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, the common vector of plague, is well established throughout the United States, particularly in the southern United States and southern California. It is important to remember that more than 1500 species of fleas and 230 species of rodents are infected with Yersinia pestis. Only 30 to 40 rodent species, however, are permanent reservoirs of the infection (Macy, 1999) . Plague is infrequently reported in the United States, with a low of 1 case in 1972 and a high of 40 cases in 1983 (Craven and Barnes, 1991) . Ninety percent of the cases have been diagnosed in New Mexico, Colorado, and California. Urban development (particularly in New Mexico) encroached into plague-enzootic rodent habitats, placing human populations at increased risk of contracting the disease. In addition to rodent epizootics, dogs, and increasingly cats, either have served as passive transporters of the disease or have been actively infected (Rosner, 1987) . The disease has seasonal peaks, with the highest proportion occurring May through September.",

In the 1950s, in a study conducted in Baltimore, 45.5% of 1643 rats were infected with Leptospira; higher prevalence rates occurred in older rats (approximately 60%). In the late 1970s, more than 90% of adult Brown Norway rats sampled in Detroit were infected with L. icterohaemorrhagiae (Thiermann, 1977) . Other studies confirm the high prevalence of this organism in wild rats inhabiting U.S. cities (Alexander, 1984; Sanger and Thiermann, 1988) . Rodent reservoir hosts of leptospirosis, in addition to rats, include mice, field moles, hedgehogs, gerbils, squirrels, rabbits, and hamsters (Torten, 1979; Fox and Lipman, 1991) . Livestock serve as a significant source of primary long-term shedding of at least three serovars. Cattle are the natural carriers of the serotype L. hardjo, whereas swine carry L. pomona and L. bratislava; each animal can shed the organism for extended periods in their urine. Dogs also commonly harbor two other serotypes; feral dogs harbor L. icterohaemorrhagiae as well as serve as natural carrier hosts of L. canicola. Sheep, goats, and horses can also be infected with a variety of serotypes. Raccoons are reservoirs of L. antumnalis, whereas rats, mice, and otherwild rodents are common animal hosts for another serotype, L. ballum. In wild mice, the infection can persist unnoticed for the ani-mal's lifetime and can also be harbored by laboratory mice, although their carrier rates in the United States are unknown (Torten, 1979) . There was, however, a report of leptospirosis in a research colony of mice in the United States in the early 1980s (Alexander, 1984) . In several European laboratories, personnel have contracted leptospires from laboratory rats (Geller, 1979) .",

Infection with Leptospira most frequently results from handling infected animals (contaminating the hands with urine) or from aerosol exposure during cage cleaning. Skin abrasions or mucous membrane exposure may serve as the portal of entry in humans. All secretions and excretions from infected animals should be considered infective. In one instance, a father apparently was infected after his daughter used his toothbrush to clean a contaminated pet mouse cage. Handling infected wild rats increases the risk of contracting leptospires (Luzzi et al., 1987) . Also, a young man died of acute leptospirosis by falling into a heavily polluted river contaminated with L. icterohaemorrhagiae (Sanger and Thiermann, 1988) . In addition, rodent bites can transmit the disease. Children living in rat-infested tenements may be at increased risk of infection. For example, children from inner-city Detroit had significantly higher L. icterohaemorrhagiae antibody titers when compared to those of children living in the Detroit suburbs (Demers et al., 1983) . Outbreaks of leptospirosis in humans with varying mortality in underdeveloped countries were documented in 1995-1998. iii. Clinical signs. The disease may vary from inapparent to severe infection and death. Infected individuals experience a biphasic disease (Stoenner and Maclean, 1958; Sanger and Thiermann, 1988; Faine, 1991) .

During the second phase of the disease, conjunctival suffusion and a rash may occur. On examination, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal findings may be abnormal. Penicillin is the drug of choice in treating early onset of leptospirosis infection (Faine, 1991) . Ampicillin and doxycycline have also been effective in treating people with leptospirosis.",

As an aid to diagnosis, leptospires can sometimes be observed by examination or direct staining of body fluids or fresh tissue suspensions. The definitive diagnosis in humans or animals is made by culturing the organisms from tissue or fluid samples, or by animal inoculation (particularly in 3-to 4-weekold hamsters) and subsequent culture and isolation. Culture media with long-chain fatty acids with 1% bovine serum albumin are routinely used as a detoxicant (Faine, 1991) . Serological assessment is accomplished by indirect hemagglutination, agglutination analysis, complement fixation, microscopic agglutination, and fluorescent antibody techniques (Faine, 1991) . The serological test most frequently used is the microscopic agglutination test, which employs dark-field microscopy. Titers of 1\"100 or greater are considered significant. Personnel hygiene and protective garments that minimize exposure to infected urine and other infected animal tissue are important for control of zoonotic infection with leptospires.",

Because of the slow growth of H. cinaedi and other enteric helicobacters, laboratory diagnosis is unlikely if blood culture procedures that rely on visual detection of the culture media are used (Kiehlbauch et al., 1994; Burman et al., 1995; Kiehlbauch et al., 1995) . Use of dark-field microscopy or acridine orange staining of blood culture media, rather than gram staining, increases likelihood of seeing the organism. Likewise, fecal isolation is difficult; selective antibiotic media are required, and recovery is facilitated by passing fecal homogenates through a 0.45 ~tm filter (Gebhart et al., 1989) . In one study, several strains of both H. cinaedi and H. fennelliae were inhibited by concentrations of cephalothin and cetazolin used frequently in selective media for isolation of enteric microaerophilic bacterium. These organisms also require an environment rich in hydrogen for optimum in vitro growth. Until diagnostic laboratories embark on routine isolation attempts of Helicobacter spp. from feces, the extent of their presence in companion and pocket pets and their zoonotic potential will be unknown.",

Because gastric helicobacterlike organisms (GHLO) (i.e., \"H. heilmannii\" or H. felis, currently referred to as H. bizzozeronii in dogs) cause a small percentage of gastritis in humans and no environmental source for these bacteria has been recognized, various animals, particularly dogs and cats, have been implicated in zoonotic transmission. In colony-reared animals, GHLO infection may approach 100%. Helicobacter pylori, the primary gastric pathogen in humans, has been isolated from only one colony of commercial cats and macaque species. If H. pylori, as demonstrated in commercially reared cats (Handt et al., 1994; Fox etal., 1996) , is isolated from pet cats, the zoonotic potential of helicobacteriosis from cats would obviously increase substantially. Heli-cobacter pylori infection is an important cause of human gastritis; however, most epidemiologic studies do not incriminate animal contact as a cause of human infection. An epidemiologic survey conducted in Germany did not show an increased risk of H. pylori because of cat ownership. In a serological survey measuring antibodies to H. pylori, lower socioeconomic status, and not pet ownership or day care, was associated with seropositivity (Staat et al., 1996) .",

Until all animal feeds in the United States and Europe are Salmonella-free and animals are procured from Salmonella-free sources, laboratory animal-associated cases of salmonellosis in humans will continue. Endemic salmonellosis in commercially raised guinea pigs as well as dogs, cats, and nonhuman primates has also been a source of infection in personnel working with these animals. Prevalence data from eight studies conducted worldwide indicated that a wide range (0.6-27%) of cats were culture-positive for Salmonella, and a conservative estimate for the U.S. canine population would be 10%. Rats are extremely susceptible to infection with Salmo-nella spp. In studies performed in the 1920s through 1940s, prevalence of Salmonella in wild rats surveyed in the United States varied from 1 to 18%, compared to 19% in Europe (Geller, 1979; Weisbroth, 1979; Alexander, 1984) . In experimental studies, when rats were dosed orally with Salmonella, 10% shed the organism in the 2 months after inoculation, and a few remained carriers when examined 5 months after experimental challenge. These rats, when placed with other naive rats, were capable of initiating new epizootics. Fortunately, the disease in laboratory rats, although common prior to 1939, has been isolated rarely in U.S. commercially reared rats since that time. Birds and reptiles are particularly dangerous sources of Salmonella; as much as 94% of all reptiles harbor Salmonella spp. (Chiodini and Sundberg, 1981) . Turtles have received a great deal of zoonotic attention and in 1970 alone may have caused 280,000 human cases of salmonellosis. In the late 1960s, with annual sales of 15 million turtles, zoonotic salmonellosis became a growing problem. In 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned importation of turtles and turtle eggs and the interstate shipment of turtles that were not certified as free of Salmonella or Arizona hinshawii in their state of origin. However, the unreliable effectiveness of this method forced the FDA in 1975 to rule against the sale of viable turtle eggs or live turtles with a carapace length less than 10.2 cm, with exceptions made for educational or scientific institutions and marine turtles. Subsequently, there was a substantial decrease in turtle-associated salmonellosis, indicating the efficacy of this regulation. These restrictions are difficult to enforce, and other reptiles, e.g., iguanas, are increasingly cited in zoonotic outbreaks of salmonellosis, particularly in children. Also of note, because of repeated reports of chick-and ducklingassociated salmonellosis, some states have also restricted their sale as pets.",

Fat and moisture in food promote survival of Salmonella. Pasteurization of milk and proper cooking of food (56~ for 10 to 20 min) effectively destroy Salmonella. In the laboratory, control and prevention of salmonellosis depends on the rapid detection, removal, or treatment of both acute and chronic animal infections, particularly during the quarantine period. Multiple antibiotic resistance is commonly encountered in Salmonella strains. For example, multiple-resistant S. typhimurium strain DT104 has been increasingly cited (in Europe and recently in the United States) as a cause of human infections (Tauxe, 1999) . Importantly, this organism has been isolated from farm animals, cats, wild birds, rodents, foxes, and badgers. It definitely has been transmitted from cattle and sheep",

Large epidemics have occurred in humans ingesting the organism in contaminated municipal drinking water. Sporulated oocysts can exist in the intestine before being excreted. Disease transmission is through ingestion of infectious oocysts.

Another transmission was recorded in an individual who became infected performing a survey of Cryptosporidium spp. in calves (Reese et al., 1982) . In this patient, clinical remission occurred by day 13, and oocytes of cryptosporidium were no longer apparent on fecal flotation (Fig. 5) . Disease in neonatal ruminants may be subclinical or may present with protracted watery diarrhea, very similar to what occurs in humans. Symptoms in humans occur 1 to 2 weeks after contact with infected calves, and diarrhea may be accompanied by vomiting, severe abdominal cramps, lassitude, fever, and headache. Disease is generally self-limiting except in immunocompromised individuals (Fayer and Ungar, 1986) . Most of the recorded cases of protracted human cryptosporidiosis have occurred in immunodeficient individuals, particularly AIDs patients, and are regarded as opportunistic infections (Chin, 2000) . Disease in these individuals produced low-grade fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal cramps, and a protracted, watery diarrhea. Repeated intestinal biopsies in a patient have documented indigenous cryptosporidial stages for as long as 1 year; clinical signs also persisted in this patient. concentrated by the Sheather sugar flotation or the Formalinethyl acetate method. Histologic evaluation of intestinal and rectal biopsies can also be used for diagnosis. Currently, no pharmaceutic agent is effective in treating cryptosporidiosis. More than 50 antibiotics have been tried without effect. Immunocompromised patients are persistently infected. Some drugs, such as paromomycin, may reduce the symptoms, and new drugs are being tested. The infection persists until the host's immune response clears the parasite.",

These laboratory animal hosts have not been shown to be important in zoonotic infection by T. gondii in the laboratory environment because the organism replicates only asexually in extraintestinal sites (Parker and Holliman, 1992; Herwaldt and Juranek, 1993) . Serological surveys conducted in the United States during the early 1980s using the Sabin-Feldman dye test have demonstrated T. gondii infection in 30-80% of cats (Ladiges et al., 1982) .

Toxoplasmosis has been found in humans and most warm-blooded animals. An estimated 500 million humans have been infected ii. Mode of transmission. Domestic and wild felids develop extraintestinal invasion with T. gondii analogous to that of the nonfelid hosts. In addition, as the definitive hosts in the T. gondii life cycle, felines develop intestinal infection, with the shedding of oocysts. Thus, the domestic cat is the primary reservoir for the zoonotic transmission of T. gondii in the laboratory environment. The three common modes of transmission are congenital infection, ingestion of T. gondii-infected tissue, and ingestion of toxoplasma oocytes or from direct exposure and consumption of contaminated food or water (Dubey, 1998) . Most postnatally acquired infections in cats are asymptomatic and have a variable prepatent period and pattern of oocyst shedding. The prepatent period can be as brief as 3 days if the cat has ingested mice or meat containing T. gondii cysts, or it can be as long as several weeks if oocysts have been ingested. Shedding of oocysts in the feces occurs for 1-2 weeks, during which time cats are considered a public health risk (Dubey, 1998) . Oocysts become infectious after sporulation, which occurs in 1-5 days. Oocysts survive best in warm, moist soil. Oocyst shedding is less likely to occur if the cat was infected by oocysts or tachyzoites than if infection resulted from the ingestion of Toxoplasma cysts. Oocyst shedding can be reactivated by induction of hypercorticism or by superinfection with other feline microorganisms, such as Isosporafelis (Chessman, 1972) . Oocysts of T. gondii have been observed infrequently in the feces of naturally infected cats (Ladiges et al., 1982) , and shedding usually precedes the development of antibody titers to T. gondii. The oocyst is very hardy and can survive freezing and as much as several months of extreme heat and dehydration. Importantly, high IgG titers do not prove recent or active infection (Dubey et al., 1995) .",

Sporadic clinical cases and occasional epidemics do occur. Outbreaks have occurred when humans are exposed to oocyst-contaminated dust, either by inhalation or ingestion. Populations at high risk for infection are pregnant women and immunodeficient individuals. Congenital infection in humans results in systemic disease, frequently with severe neuropathological changes. Postnatal infection results in disease that is less severe and commonly presents as nondescript, consisting of fever, myalgia, and generalized lymphadenopathy that may resolve without treatment in a few weeks. Asymptomatic infection may recrudesce with encephalitis if patients become immunocompromised. Although rare, serious systemic toxoplasmosis can be acquired by older individuals. This is manifested by fever, maculopapular eruption, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, pneumonia, myocarditis, and meningoencephalitis. Ocular toxoplasmosis, usually chorioretinitis, is commonly seen in postnatal infections but can also occur in infections of older individuals. Clinically severe and progressive illness is most likely to develop in immunocompromised individuals. As high as 10% of AIDS patients have toxoplasmosis (Gill and Stone, 1992) . These patients develop neurologic disease and can experience convulsions, paralysis, or coma or even die from toxoplasmosis, even after treatment is administered.",

Chemotherapeutic treatment is indicated in patients with diagnosed clinical disease, active ocular lesions, or congenital infection, and in immunocompromised individuals with disease suggestive of toxoplasmosis. The preferred therapy is pyrimethamine administered in combination with sulfonamide. Laboratoryacquired infections are likely restricted to the use and handling of laboratory cats (DiGiacomo et al., 1990) . Rigorous sanitation should effectively prevent human toxoplasmosis from occurring in the laboratory environment. Since oocysts must sporulate before they are infectious, daily cleaning of litter plans will prevent accumulation of infectious oocysts. Personnel should wear gloves when handling litter pans and wash their hands thoroughly before eating. Pregnant women should completely avoid contact with cat feces. Interestingly, there is no correlation between toxoplasmosis in adults and cat ownership. Most cats acquire infection shortly after weaning and shed the oocysts for a short period of time (< 3 weeks). Nevertheless, unsporulated oocysts are more susceptible to proper disinfection, and control of exposure should be centered around disinfection of litter pans at this stage.",

Control of mite infestation is primarily dependent on their habitats. Some, such as Sarcoptes sp. and Notoedres spp. are obligate parasites that require treatment of the host. Other mites, such as Ornithonyssus bacoti, which live most of the time off the animal, require treatment of the environment with appropriate insecticides (Markell et al., 1999) .",

The brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, is an exception. It readily infests kennels and vivaria. Ticks, like mites, can transmit a variety of diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tick-borne typhus, Lyme disease, and others (Table IV) . Lyme borreliosis is a commonly reported tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. The illness is caused by a spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted during the blood feeding of ticks of the genus Ixodes. The larvae and nymphs feed readily on a wide range of hosts, including birds, and an abundance of reservoir hosts exists, usually small and medium-sized animals. Larger animals, such as deer, sheep, cows, or horses, must be present for the maintenance of the tick population since adult ticks only engorge successfully on larger animals. Transmission occurs through salivation during the feeding process on a host.",

Three rodent fleas, Xenopsylla cheopis, Nasopsyllus fasciatus, and Leptopsylla segnis, have been found in a high percentage of urban dwellings in certain areas of the United States and are potential transmitters of disease in the laboratory. Apparently, X. cheopis in the past was readily established in animal facilities. At a Midwestern U.S. university, it inhabited rooms housing laboratory mice, where on two separate occasions fleas bit students (Yunker, 1964) . Leptopsylla segnis, the mouse and rat flea, bites humans and is a vector for plague and typhus, serious diseases in humans. Leptopsylla segnis can also serve as an intermediate host for the rodent tapeworms Hymenolepis nana and H. diminuta, both of which can infect humans (Markell et al., 1999) . The flea bite can be irritating and can cause allergic dermatitis. The cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, is the most common flea in and around human dwellings in the United States. This flea is capable of experimentally transmitting plague and murine typhus, and therefore the potential exists for transmitting the disease to humans. Control of fleas consists of treatment of infested areas as well as the primary host; in the case of rodent fleas, the animal facility must be free of feral rodents and their entry to prevent introduction of these arthropods.",

Direct infection and internal autoinfection can also occur. Heavy infections result in abdominal distress, enteritis, anal pruritis, anorexia, and headache Oral and transcutaneous infections can occur in animals and humans. Heavy infections can produce dermatitis, verminous pneumonitis, enteritis. Internal autoinfection can occur Rare and asymptomatic Oral and transcutaneous routes of infection occur. Heavy infections produce transient respiratory signs during larval migration followed by anemia due to gastrointestinal blood loss Heavy infections produce diarrhea Heavy infections result in anemia. Encapsulated parasitic granulomas are usually an inocuous sequella to infection Infection occurs by ingestion of embryonated eggs only. Embryonation, requiring 2 or more weeks, ordinarily would not occur in laboratory. Heavy infections can produce severe respiratory and gastrointestinal tract disease Oral and inhalational infection can occur. Disease in humans characterized by perianal pruritis, irritability, and disturbed sleep Three-week embryonation makes laboratory infection highly unlikely. Heavy infection in humans results in intermittent abdominal pain, bloody stools, diarrhea, and occasionally rectal prolapse Chronic eosinophilic granulomatous lesions distributed throughout various organs. Should not be encountered in laboratory Infections in aberrant host produces granulomas in visceral organs with a predilection for the central nervous system Transcutaneous infection causes a parasitic dermatitis called \"creeping eruption\"",
