Passive immunotherapy via either convalescent plasma or mAbs has proven to be effective for other infectious agents. Following infection with MERS-CoV, common marmosets were treated with high titer hyperimmune plasma or the mAb m336, at 6 and 48 h post inoculation. Both treatments reduced signs of clinical disease, but reduction in viral loads in the respiratory tract were only found in the hyperimmune plasma group. A decrease in gross pathology was found only in the mAb-treated group, but no histological differences were observed between treated and control animals. While both hyperimmune plasma and the m336 treatments reduced the severity of disease in the common marmoset, neither treatment resulted in full protection against disease.",

It has therefore been speculated that the potential for viral escape mutants might be limited by the requirement of the spike protein to bind to DPP4 (Ying et al., 2015) . Prophylactic treatment with m336 resulted in significantly reduced viral titer in rabbit lung tissue (Houser et al., 2016) and both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with m336 protected mice against lethality by MERS-CoV infection (Agrawal et al., 2016) . Here we assess the effect of treatment with marmoset-derived hyperimmune plasma as well as the human mAb m336 on disease outcome in the recently developed marmoset MERS-CoV infection model, which recapitulates severe respiratory disease (Falzarano et al., 2014) .",

The hyperimmune plasma and monoclonal antibody groups, consisting of one female and two male common marmosets each, received 1 ml hyperimmune plasma or m336 diluted in PBS (5 mg/ml) intravenous (I.V.) at 6 hpi, and 1 ml hyperimmune plasma or m336 subcutaneous (S.C.) at 2 dpi (marmosets H1-3, M1-3). Two out of three animals in the control group (all male common marmosets), received 1 ml control plasma I.V. 6 hpi, and 1 ml control plasma S.C. 2 dpi (marmosets C1-2). The third animal received 1 ml of PBS (diluent of the mAb) via the same routes (marmoset C3). The animals were observed twice daily for clinical signs of disease, using a scoring system as described previously (Falzarano et al., 2014) . Breathing was scored as normal (<60/minute), increased (60e100/ minute), or severely increased (>100/minute). Based on the scoring sheet, euthanasia was indicated at a clinical score of 35 or more. Clinical exams were performed on 0, 2, 5, and 7 dpi on anaesthetized animals using isoflurane and ketamine. X-rays were taken and nasal, oral, fecal, and urogenital swabs were collected in 1 ml DMEM with 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. Blood samples were collected on \u00c05, 2, and 7 dpi and examined using the Piccolo Xpress chemistry analyzer (Abaxis). The blood sample collected on 2 dpi was obtained before treatment was administered. Temperature was monitored with IPTT-300 temperature probes (BMDS) that were injected interscapularly prior to the start of the experiment. All animals were euthanized at 7 dpi (Fig. 1A) . Terminal blood samples were obtained and samples of the following tissues were collected: conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, tonsil, trachea, four lung lobes, mediastinal lymph node, liver, spleen, kidney, and bladder. Gross pathology (surface area of the lung which was either consolidated and/or hyperemic) per lung lobe was documented as percentage area affected by lesions.",

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) treatment for MERS-CoV would be the use of neutralizing antibodies, either via convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies. Severity of disease has been associated with a delayed adaptive immune response (Park et al., 2015) , and thus antibody-based therapy might be beneficial. Administration of neutralizing antibodies early in disease onset when patients were infected with respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV and influenza A virus was reported to be beneficial (Mair-Jenkins et al., 2014) . Treatment of SARS-CoV-infected patients with convalescent plasma early in disease progression resulted in a higher likelihood of disease remission and survival (Cheng et al., 2005) and administering convalescent plasma in two SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers resulted in complete recovery (Yeh et al., 2005) . Convalescent plasma treatment of patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus infection resulted in reduced mortality and respiratory tract viral load (Hung et al., 2011) . Meta-analysis of studies on the treatment of Spanish influenza H1N1 1918 with convalescent plasma showed an absolute reduction of 21% in case-fatality rate (Luke et al., 2006) .",

Furthermore, it has been suggested that severity of disease is linked to serological response; in patients who developed severe disease upon infection with MERS-CoV higher neutralizing antibody levels were detected, whereas in patients with mild or subclinical disease lower and potentially short-lived neutralizing antibody levels were detected (Drosten et al., 2014; Park et al., 2015) . It has been well-established that severity of disease is linked to the prevalence of comorbidities (Badawi and Ryoo, 2016) , the existence of which might contradict the collection of convalescent serum. Thus, the pool of healthy subjects with sufficient neutralizing antibody titer in convalescent plasma might be very limited. Finally, the hyperimmune plasma used in this study had a high neutralizing antibody titer of 3840, whereas at best human convalescent plasma has neutralizing antibody titers of 320e800 (Park et al., 2015; Arabi et al., 2016) (these studies use different methods to measure neutralizing antibodies). It is unclear whether convalescent plasma with lower neutralizing titers would have a similar effect on disease progression, as lower neutralizing antibody titers in the circulation will likely be reached. Monoclonal antibodies could provide an alternative; mAb treatment of healthy volunteers inoculated with influenza A virus H3N2 resulted in a reduction in median viral load in nasal swabs and a 35% reduction in median total symptoms (Ramos et al., 2015) .",

Prophylactic treatment with m336 via the I.V. or I.N. route resulted in significantly reduced viral titer (40e9000 fold) in rabbit lung tissue. In contrast, administration of m336 1 dpi via the same routes did not reduce viral RNA titers in the lungs of rabbits (Houser et al., 2016) . Reduced mortality and morbidity was observed in a MERS-CoV mouse model upon intraperitoneal prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with m336, and therapeutic treatment resulted in a decrease in viral titer as well as viral RNA in lung tissue (Agrawal et al., 2016) . It can be argued that neither the rabbit nor the mouse model have a high predictive value for potential MERS therapies in humans. Rabbits remain asymptomatic upon inoculation with MERS-CoV and infection appears to be more prominent in the upper respiratory tract, which suggests that disease progression in rabbits differs considerably from that observed in patients who will require antiviral therapy most (Haagmans et al., 2015) . The mouse as a model is valuable as an initial validation method of a therapy, but the predictive value of mouse models for therapeutic applications in humans is relatively limited as opposed to non-human primate models (Seok et al., 2013) .",

However, the observed differences were relatively minimal and no differences in histopathology were observed. In contrast, treatment with m336 in the common marmoset did not result in a significant decrease in respiratory tract viral loads compared to control animals, however a significant reduction in disease severity was observed. This was most pronounced when comparing diseaseassociated signs. Only one animal treated with m336 showed increased respiratory rates (>60 breaths/minute), and all animals had no evidence of infiltration radiographically, showed decreased levels of gross pathology and the lowest lung to body weight ratio. However, no changes in histology were observed compared to control animals.",

Treatment with mAbs reduced the occurrence of severe respiratory symptoms further than hyperimmune plasma did, combined with less gross pathology. mAbs might therefore be a better therapy if the goal is to elevate symptoms associated with severe MERS disease. Hyperimmune plasma reduced viral titers, but if a reduction in viral lung load does not result in less severe symptoms, the question is raised of what the importance is of such a change. Regardless, the observed differences are small and most treated animals showed mild-to-moderate respiratory symptoms, suggesting that the effect of both treatments is limited.",
