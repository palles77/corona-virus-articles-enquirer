We discuss which strategies have been assessed immunologically and which have been evaluated in SARS coronavirus challenge models. We discuss inactivated vaccines, virally and bacterially vectored vaccines, recombinant protein and DNA vaccines, as well as the use of attenuated vaccines. Data regarding the correlates of protection, animal models and the available evidence regarding potential vaccine enhancement of SARS disease are discussed. While there is much evidence that various vaccine strategies against SARS are safe and immunogenic, vaccinated animals still display significant disease upon challenge. Current data suggest that intranasal vaccination may be crucial and that new or combination strategies may be required for good protective efficacy against SARS in humans.",

            "text": "SARS vaccines: where are we? Expert Rev. Vaccines 8(7), 887-898 (2009) Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused 8098 reported human infections and 774 deaths in 32 countries in a single fall-tospring period (2002) (2003) , and also led to travel restrictions and significant effects on the global economy [201] . The etiologic agent of SARS was identified as a new human coronavirus (CoV), order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, by the sequencing of its genome [1, 2] and by experimental infection of macaques to fulfill Koch's postulates [3] . Serologic evidence suggests zoonotic transmission of SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV) into the human population for several years before the recognized outbreak [4] , and transmission to humans has continued, resulting in at least four independent nonlaboratory-associated cases in 2004 [5] [6] [7] 202 ]. The movement of SARS-CoV into the human population over several years suggests a need to prepare vaccines for protection from this potentially emerging agent. SARS-CoV is of particular concern as a zoonosis because it can replicate in a large number of animals including dogs, cats, pigs, mice, ferrets, foxes, monkeys and rats [8] [9] [10] , in addition to Chinese palm civets, raccoon-dogs and bats, which appear to be the natural host [11, 12] .",

The incubation period for the disease ranges from 2 to 10 days, and infectivity is maximal during the second week of disease [19, 20] . The disease is characterized by fever, chills, malaise, dyspnea, cough, diarrhea and pneumonia [13] [14] [15] . Diffuse alveolar damage along with inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting particularly of macrophages are hallmarks found in SARS patients [21] . The fever of most patients abates within 2 weeks and is accompanied by resolution of chest symptoms and radiologic changes [3, [13] [14] [15] 22] . The major mode of transmission of SARS-CoV is believed to be through droplet spread [2, 23] , although SARS-CoV can remain viable when dried on surfaces for up to 6 days [24] . The majority of SARS patients are adults with only a few cases in children aged 15 years or younger [19, 20, 25] . The overall case-fatality rate is approximately 10% [19, 203] .",

The S protein serves as the major viral attachment protein, critical to virus binding and fusion of the viral envelope [29] , and thus has been a major target antigen for vaccine development. The receptor-S protein interaction is a major determinant of species specificity and tissue tropism for CoV [30] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD209L were identified as functional receptors for SARS-CoV; however, entry through ACE2 is more efficient [31, 32] .

In one study, WKV vaccine was shown to protect against pulmonary SARS-CoV replication in BALB/c mice, although characterization of the immune response was not reported [48] . Our consortium (The SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative) prepared a b-propiolactone-inactivated WKV SARS-CoV (Tor-2 strain) vaccine and compared its immunogenicity and efficacy to a combination of attenuated Ads expressing either S or N proteins for the ability to protect against live SARS-CoV challenge in a permissive mouse model [49] . Our results showed that the WKV vaccine, in the presence or absence of alum adjuvant, provided protection against live SARS-CoV challenge by the induction of high levels of neutralizing antibodies and the reduction of SARS-CoV load in the respiratory tract compared with mock-vaccinated mice [49] . CoV-like particles have also been developed by coexpression of SARS-CoV S protein with E, M and N proteins of mouse hepatitis virus, thus mimicking WKV. This preparation was shown to induce neutralizing antibodies and to protect mice against SARS-CoV replication in lungs [50] , but there was no direct experimental comparison made with the WKV vaccine.",

WKV has also been tested in ferrets, a model that shows clinical signs and significant lung pathology [51, 52] . Formalin-inactivated wholevirus Urbani strain of SARS-CoV without adjuvant induced some neutralizing antibodies, and led to earlier clearance of virus after challenge, but provided only mild protection in ferrets [53] . Lung tissues were analyzed 23 days postchallenge and did not show significant changes between mock and vaccinated animals, but this time point may have been too late to reveal vaccinationinduced differences in disease. The authors commented, \"the vaccine was not immunologically robust\". Our consortium also Review tested b-propiolactone-inactivated WKV and compared it with Ad-vectored S and N vaccines in ferrets [52] , and found that both vaccines induced neutralizing antibody responses and reduced viral replication and shedding in the upper respiratory tract, and progression of virus to the lower respiratory tract. The vaccines also diminished hemorrhage in the thymus, and reduced the severity and extent of pneumonia and damage to lung epithelia. However, despite high neutralizing antibody titers, protection was incomplete for all vaccine preparations and administration routes tested. Formaldehyde-inactivated SARS-CoV was used to vaccinate rhesus monkeys [54] , and the vaccine was shown to be safe and immuno genic (it induced neutralizing antibodies). However, evidence of protection was lacking, as only one of the two PBSvaccinated monkeys showed any clinical signs after challenge, and they were mild. Inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine has been administered to 36 human subjects and was found to be safe, well tolerated and able to elicit SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies; however, lacking a natural challenge, there is no data on efficacy [55] . While it is widely accepted that endogenous antigen production (via recombinant or attenuated bacterial or viral delivery) yields superior T-lymphocyte responses, we found that SARS-CoV-specific IFN-gsecreting T-cell responses were similar in WKV and Ad vector S/N-vaccinated mice [49] , suggesting that WKV may induce a T-cell response equal to vectored vaccines. Thus, the accumulated data indicate that WKV vaccines are safe and they induce SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and can even activate T lympho cytes; however, compelling evidence of protective efficacy is scant or absent.",

Recombinant viruses express the foreign target protein in the cytoplasm of the host cell, much like an intracellular pathogen. Thus, the endogenous antigen is available for processing by the cellular antigen-processing machinery for expression with MHC class I for presentation to CD8 + T lymphocytes and development of cytotoxic T cells. As a result, recombinant viruses result in activation of cellular immunity often necessary for elimination of infected cells. For SARS-CoV vaccines, several viruses have been used to express SARS-CoV proteins with the goal of inducing both strong cellular immunity and neutralizing antibodies.",

The last difficulty may be circumvented by the use of prime-boost protocols where a different vector (e.g., DNA vaccine) is used to prime the immune response followed by a boost with a recombinant Ad [56] . First, it was demonstrated that Ad vectors encoding SARS proteins were immunogenic. Rhesus macaques immunized intramuscularly with a combination of three Ad5-SARS-CoV Ad-based vectors (N, S and M protein) all generated antibody responses against spike S1 fragment, SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses against the N protein [60].

            "text": "Protection against SARS-CoV challenge by Ad-vectored vaccines was first tested in mice [49] . We developed recombinant Ad constructs expressing genes for either SARS-CoV S or N proteins, and immunized SARS-CoV-susceptible 129S6/SvEv mice [61] with both vectors combined, either intranasally or intramuscularly. The vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibody, anti-SARS-CoV N protein IFN-g secretion, and significantly reduced viral titers and RNA in the lungs of challenged mice [49] . Interestingly, although the intramuscular route was more effective in inducing neutralizing SARS serum antibodies, the intranasal route of administration induced IgA and was more effective in blocking SARS-CoV replication in nose and lung tissue (1000-fold in nasal secretions). This finding suggests that the intranasal administration of recombinant Ad N and S proteins may induce crucial protective mucosal immunity. In the same study, we compared adeno-vectored S and N vaccines with a preparation of inactivated SARS-CoV. The combined adeno-S and -N vaccine induced significantly lower neutralizing antibodies and similar anti-N IFN-g-secreting cells compared with inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine, but the inactivated vaccine provided superior protection measured as SARS-CoV lung titers and RNA [49] . We also compared these vaccines in a ferret model in which ferrets show clinical signs, including fever and lung damage [52] . Both the whole-killed SARS-CoV vaccine and the combination of Ads encoding N and S proteins induced neutralizing antibody responses, reduced viral replication in the respiratory tract, and decreased tissue damage in the thymus and lungs [52] . The adeno-S and -N vaccine delivered intranasally elicited a poor serum-neutralizing antibody response but provided the best protection from lung replication and lung damage [52] , indicating that serum-neutralizing antibodies are not a sufficient measure of protective efficacy of a vaccine. In addition, despite high neutralizing antibody titers in some vaccines, protection was incomplete for all vaccine preparations (with one homologous boost) and administration routes, suggesting that combinations of vaccines may be necessary to provide adequate protection against SARS in susceptible animals and humans.",

In particular, exogenously produced proteins are typically presented with MHC class II and thus often do not generate robust cytotoxic T-cell responses. CoV S proteins are the favorite targets in CoV subunit vaccine development since this viral protein contains determinants known to elicit protective immune responses [73, 74] . Consequently, the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, shown to be responsible for receptor binding to cellular ACE2, is an attractive target for the development of both vaccine and therapeutics [75, 76] . This approach is strongly supported by the finding that a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the N-terminal of S protein potently neutralizes SARS-CoV infection and inhibits syncytia formation through blocking of receptor binding [77] . Moreover, the S protein has been shown to induce serum-neutralizing antibodies and confer protective immunity against SARS-CoV challenge in mice and African green monkeys [62, 64, 78] . Since several other proteins are also expressed on the surface of the virion (Figure 1) and elicit antibodies detectable in sera of convalescent SARS patients [35] , other proteins may also be useful to augment protective immunity. For example, antibodies to M proteins have also been shown to have neutralizing activity [79] . In addition, it has also been shown that SARS-CoV S protein can generate CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses [37] .",

DNA vaccination with SARS-CoV N protein linked to calreticulin to increase MHC class I presentation not only generated potent N-specific humoral and T-cell-mediated immune responses against N protein-expressing cells but also significantly reduced the titer of challenging vaccinia virus expressing the N protein [88] .

Thus, various prime-boost strategies have been developed that increase efficacy. DNA vaccination may be performed in conjunction with a heterologous prime or boost with proteins, inactivated viral vaccine candidates or viral vectors [12,37,95,100,101]. These strategies often provide superior immune responses and can also determine the magnitude and type of immune response (e.g., Th1/Th2). While DNA vaccines for SARS may hold promise, evidence of protection in a good SARS animal model is needed.",

            "text": "The most long-lasting and protective vaccines are those comprised of an attenuated pathogen or a closely related but avirulent live virus, such as the use of the naturally occurring vaccinia virus, a low-virulence member of the same genus, to vaccinate against smallpox. These vaccines are more efficacious due to their persistence in the host, possession of pathogen-encoded immuneactivating moieties, and their appropriate location both in the body and in the cell, yielding endogenouS protein production and efficient MHC class I presentation, generating a robust cytotoxic T-cell response. The difficulty with attenuated vaccines is that attenuating point mutations may revert causing virulence, and deletion-attenuated mutants may recombine with naturally occurring environmental wild viruses to regain virulence, as has been seen with the attenuated oral poliovirus. Given safety concerns, it is often difficult to gain regulatory approval of attenuated vaccines without strong proof that the threat of disease is sufficient to warrant the use of such a vaccine. For SARS, this threshold has not yet been met, but some interesting attenuated mutants have been developed. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a live-attenuated vaccine consisting of a recombinant SARS-CoV lacking the small E gene were studied. Deletion of E causes reduced viral morphogenesis and virus titers in vitro and in vivo, and thus attenuates the virus [102, 103] . Hamsters immunized with this deletion mutant developed high levels of serum-neutralizing antibodies and were protected from clinical signs (decreased activity) and replication of homologous (SARS-CoV, Urbani) and heterologous (GD03) SARS-CoV in the upper and lower respiratory tract [104] . Thus, deletion of the structural E gene may be a first step toward development of a live-attenuated SARS-CoV vaccine. The deletion of the nsp-1 gene in the related CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been shown to create a highly efficacious attenuated vaccine, suggesting that this approach may also be attempted for the development of a SARS-attenuated vaccine [105] . Two comprehensive studies on gene deletion and attenuation effects showed that deletion of ORFs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b or 9b (highlighted in Table 1 ) had little or no effect on viral replication both in vitro and in vivo [103, 106] . It is not known if deletion of these genes might have an attenuating effect in higher mammals. However, given the disappointing protection afforded by most SARS-CoV vaccine strategies explored to date, it seems that further exploration of attenuated SARS-CoV vaccines is justified. In that vein, exploration has been undertaken on the effects of rearrangement of the SARS-CoV genome, which has been shown to be attenuating in MHV [107] . This system has the additional advantage of making recombination of the vaccine with wild CoVs (thus restoring virulence) less likely. Other strategies to protect from virulence-restoring recombination events include multiple attenuating gene knockouts, with or without growth of the virus in trans-complementing cells lines, and replacement of transcriptional regulatory sequences (analogous to promoters in most systems) with sequences incompatible for wild-type gene expression. These strategies have been fully and elegantly described in a recent review [108] .",

No other animal, including cynomolgus macaques, has been reported to regularly experience fever, which is the most common sign in human SARS-CoV infection, (>99%) [123, 124] . Thus, ferrets are a good model for SARS-CoV because they support replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, develop clinical disease, shed virus from the upper airway and develop severe lung pathology. Ferrets are also outbred, allowing the assessment of a range of individual responses that are documented in human SARS. Finally, the ferret model is a nonrodent model and is significantly less expensive and difficult to study than nonhuman primates. The main disadvantages of this model are that the ferret immune system is not well defined, there is a dearth of reagents and, as they are outbred, larger numbers are needed to assess statistical significance.",

Unfortunately, CoV vaccines have a history of enhancing disease, notably with feline CoVs [80, 125] . While several mechanisms may exist, the best understood is antibody-mediated entry of virus into cells via immunoglobulin Fc receptors. This has been demonstrated to occur for the SARS-CoV S protein in human B-cell lines [126] , however, the same group showed that SARS-CoV S protein-vaccinated animals showed no signs of enhanced lung pathology or hepatitis, and indeed that the viral load was reduced following challenge with SARS-CoV; although hamsters may not respond in a way similar to humans immunologically [126] . Other groups have also shown that administration of anti-S antibody does not enhance disease upon SARS-CoV challenge in mice or ferrets [78] , again suggesting that antibody is not enhancing disease in SARS-CoV infection.",

In one study, ferrets vaccinated with the poxvirus vector MVA expressing SARS-CoV S protein displayed increased liver pathology after challenge [63] compared to other groups, but liver pathology has not been increased with any other SARS-CoV vaccines. In our ferret vaccine trials using S and N proteins, we noted a delayed histopathology in vaccinated groups, but no increase in pathology compared Review to unvaccinated groups [52] . The lack of vaccine enhancement of disease is further supported by a recent study in WKV-vaccinated and challenged ferrets that were followed for 3 weeks [53] ; however, the exact details and combination of vaccine vector and antigen may control this phenomenon. In the other study that raised vaccine safety concerns, vaccination with the N protein expressed in Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles was reported to increase eosinophilic infiltration and damage in lungs of mice challenged with SARS-CoV [127] . This has not been reported in other studies, and in our studies with combination S and N protein expressed in Ad, no eosinophillic infiltration was noted in mice or ferrets [49, 52] . While each vaccine and antigenic combination must be thoroughly evaluated for safety and efficacy, the overall picture for SARS-CoV vaccines shows no particular reason for concern with vaccine enhancement of disease. In the cases where it has been reported, it appears to be confined to a particular expression system rather than specifically related to any antigen. In the vast majority of studies, immunogenicity has been elicited without any negative impact on health after challenge with the virulent pathogen.",

The ability of an antibody to neutralize virus infection is the easiest activity to measure, but it is not the only important function of antibody in antiviral defense.

Presumably, this is due to the induction of IgA, which was detected only in the intranasally vaccinated animals. We found similar results in both mice and ferrets; the same vaccine given intranasally and intramuscularly gave stronger protection when delivered by the intranasal route, particularly in terms of viral load in the lung and shedding in nasal secretions [49, 52] .

Results suggest that a protective SARS vaccine should be possible; however, protection in mammals that are susceptible to severe disease (e.g., ferrets and humans) may be more difficult than the mouse models suggest. To date, the data indicate that the most efficacious vaccine strategy might be a heterologous combination of intranasal and systemic vaccination, since each delivers different aspects of protection. Given the incomplete protection of current vaccines, it seems unwise to discount T-cell responses, which have not been adequately evaluated, or the protection that might be afforded by the inclusion of additional viral proteins (especially those displayed on the virion and on the surface of infected cells) in SARS-CoV vaccine development.",

While it is clear that antibodies to S protein offer some protection against SARS, it is equally apparent that high neutralizing antibody titers are not sufficient to protect animals from serious tissue damage after SARS-CoV challenge. Thus, it will likely be necessary to generate protective T-lymphocyte responses or antibodies to other SARS proteins, or to improve protection. Data collected thus far suggest that strategies including mucosal immunizations coupled with a heterologous systemic route of vaccination may improve efficacy. Alternatively, the development of safe attenuated SARS vaccines may be able to offer both the quality and quantity of immune response required to stop serious SARS-CoV-induced tissue damage. It will be necessary to conduct more trials with direct comparison of vaccines (and combinations of prime-boost) in appropriate animal models that more closely mimic human disease course. It will also be important to pursue an understanding of the role of T-cell immunity against SARS, since little is known at this time. Development of improved T-cell analysis reagents for ferrets will aid in this endeavor. The rate of SARS vaccine progress in the next 5 years likely depends on the perceived disease threat Review from SARS. If another epidemic or pandemic occurs, funding and research for vaccine development will be a priority. Likewise, efficacy in humans can only be demonstrated if there is another SARS outbreak among a population of vaccinated and control subjects.",
