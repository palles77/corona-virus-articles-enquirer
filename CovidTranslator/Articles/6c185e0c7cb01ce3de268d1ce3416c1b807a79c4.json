Embecovirus particles are studded with two types of surface projections called S (for 4 spike) and HE (for haemagglutinin-esterase), with S mediating receptor-binding and 5 membrane fusion and HE acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. Together, they promote 6 dynamic virion attachment to glycan-based receptors with 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as main 7 constituent. We recently showed that adaptation of HKU1 and OC43 to replication in the 8 human respiratory tract involved loss-of-function mutations in the lectin domain of HE. Here 9 we present the cryo-EM structure of the ~80 kDa, heavily glycosylated HKU1 HE at a global 10 resolution of 3.4 \u00c5. Comparison to existing HE structures reveals a drastically truncated lectin 11 domain, incompatible with sialic acid binding, but with the structure and function of the HE 12 esterase domain left intact. Our cryo-EM structure, in combination with mass spectrometry 13 analysis, also describes the extent of glycosylation on the now redundant lectin domain, which 14 forms a putative glycan shield. The findings further our insight into the evolution and host 15 adaptation of human embecoviruses and also demonstrate the utility of cryo-EM for studying 16 small, heavily glycosylated proteins which are intractable to X-ray crystallography. : bioRxiv preprint 19 mammals and birds with a propensity to cross host species barriers 1 .

Exhaustive attempts to solve its structure and 54 assess the structural consequences of the LD deletions did not meet with success, prompting 55 us to consider alternative methods. In the last decade, single-particle analysis by cryo-electron 56 microscopy (SPA cryo-EM) revolutionised the field of structural biology with methodological 57 advances now allowing the visualisation of large biological macromolecules at resolutions 58 which permit atomic modelling 19 . In the wake of these innovations, cryo-EM structures were 59 determined for several CoV S proteins, including those of OC43 and HKU1 to resolutions of 60 2.8 and 4 \u00c5 resolution, respectively 20,21 . These studies were greatly facilitated by the 61 considerable size (>400 kDa) and three-fold symmetry of the S homo-trimers. Because of the 62 low signal-to-noise ratio of cryo-EM images, SPA reconstruction of specimens smaller than 63 100 kDa remains problematic and only for a handful of such proteins, high-resolution (i.e. <3.5 64 \u00c5) cryo-EM structures have been resolved 22-24 . Nevertheless, inspired by these reports, we 65 explored SPA to characterise the homo-dimeric HKU1 HE ectodomain, a complex with a 66 protein mass of ~80 kDa plus ~30 kDa of N-glycans, most of which is disordered. Here we 67 present the structure of HKU1 HE at a global resolution of 3.4 \u00c5. The data reveal that, over 68 centuries of HKU1 circulation in humans, the variable loops that form the LD receptor-binding 69 site were trimmed back completely. The jelly roll core structure, on which these loops were 70 . CC-BY 4.0 : bioRxiv preprint grafted, remains intact, presumably to preserve structure-function of the ED SGNH hydrolase 71 into which it is embedded. Conceivably, the conservation of a functionally obsolete but 72 structurally essential domain in a viral envelope protein may pose an antigenic liability. The 73 data show that through acquisition of new N-linked glycosylation sites, the HKU1 HE LD 74 domain was provided with a putative glycan shield. The findings provide structural insight into 75 the evolution of multidomain proteins after partial loss of function and a predictive evolutionary 76 trajectory for OC43 HE.",

Single-particle analysis produced 2D class averages 88 corresponding to different views of the HKU HE dimer (Figure 1B). Subsequently, a 3D 89 reconstruction of HKU1 HE was produced at a global resolution of 3.4 \u00c5 (Figure 1C, S2 and 90 S3A-B). Local resolution of the map ranges from 3.3-4.1 \u00c5 with the most well-resolved regions 91 located in the core of the molecule (Figure S3D). The quality of the map permitted modelling 92 of residues 15-346 (Figure 1D-E). Each protomer is stabilised by six disulfide bonds, the 93 presence of which are corroborated by the cryo-EM density (Figure 1F). Dimerisation of HKU1 94 HE is achieved by interaction of the vestigial LDs and the membrane-proximal domains (MP) 95 (Figure 2A-B). : bioRxiv preprint comparison of the membrane proximal domain and esterase domain of HKU1 to these related 100 proteins revealed a high-level of structural conservation, with the aligned Ca\uf061 positions having 101 RMSD values of 0.81 \u00c5 and 0.76 \u00c5 for MHV-New-Jersey (NJ) strain, and 0.83 \u00c5 and 0.84 \u00c5 102 for BCoV-Mebus strain. While the core fold of the esterase domain is similar between all three 103 proteins, the \u03b12 helix of HKU1 more closely resembles that of BCoV 15 , and lacks the zinc 104 binding site found in MHV-NJ 17 forms a zinc binding site 17 . The ED catalytic site of HKU1 HE 105 is most similar to that of BCoV, OC43 and MHV-DVIM strain (Figure S4A-B), which all 106 recognise 9-O-Ac-Sia. This is consistent with functional data showing that HKU1 HE 107 possesses sialate-9-O-acetylesterase receptor destroying activity 8 . In contrast, MHV-NJ HE 108 recognises 4-O-Ac-Sia, thus rationalising the differences observed in the active site 109 architecture 17 (Figure S4C). 110 The lectin domain of HKU1 HE dramatically differs from those of MHV-NJ and BCoV. The LD 111 jelly roll core is essentially conserved, with RMSD values of 0.95 \u00c5 and 0.89 \u00c5 for BCoV and 112 MHV-NJ, respectively. However, whereas in BCoV HE and MHV extensive loops emanate 113 from this jelly roll core to form the LD carbohydrate-binding site (CBS), such loops are either 114 much shorter or absent in the HKU1 HE structure (Figure 2E-G). As compared to the BCoV 115 and MHV HEs, HKU1 HE suffered deletions in the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop, the \u03b27-\u03b28 loop, and \u03b29-\u03b210 116 loop (\u03b211-\u03b212 in BCoV) - see figure 2 and S5. The long \u03b24-\u03b25 loop has undergone a minor 117 deletion in HKU1 HE but is also displaced with respect to that of BCoV and MHV HE, reaching 118 a maximum distance of 10 \u00c5 between residues 144-148. In BCoV and MHV HE, each of these 119 loops participates in ligand/receptor binding. In addition, the metal binding site (MBS) which 120 stabilizes the \u03b211-\u03b212 CBS loop in MHV and BCoV (\u03b213-\u03b214) is absent in HKU1 (Figure 2E-121 G). Two of the three metal coordinating sidechains, present in BCoV HE (Figure S6A), are 122 partially conserved in HKU1, indicating that the MBS was likely present in the ancestral 123 protein. However, the critical D220 site in BCoV HE falls within the \u03b27-\u03b28 loop deletion of 124 HKU1 HE (Figure S6B). Thus, HKU1 has lost all essential components of the HE CBS and 125 the LD domain has been stripped back essentially to the jelly roll core. : bioRxiv preprint 129 composition of each of these N-linked glycosylation sites, we performed in-depth 130 glycoproteomics profiling of the same recombinant HEK293T cell derived material used for 131 cryo-EM. HKU1 HE was digested in parallel with trypsin, chymotrypsin and alpha lytic protease : bioRxiv preprint 157 Side-by-side comparison of HKU1, MHV-NJ, BCoV and OC43 reveals that HKU1 HE lectin 158 domain has a much flatter topography ( Figure  4A-D) . In addition to the dramatically altered : bioRxiv preprint cryo-EM map, the glycans on the LD are not visible beyond the first core GlcNAc. However, 174 mass spectrometry analysis confirms that these primarily contain complex glycans, comprising 175 between 9 to 16 saccharide units. To understand where these lesser-ordered regions are 176 situated, a difference map of the N-linked glycans was generated and a gaussian filter was 177 applied in order to highlight low resolution features. Interestingly, density for the disordered 178 portion of these glycans forms a crown of glycan density, which encircles the LD and covers 179 much of its surface ( Figure 5C ). Of note, density belonging to the N110 glycan of HKU1 180 overlaps with the former sialic acid binding site. Side-by-side comparison shows that the LD 181 of HKU1 is ~8 \u00c5 shorter than BCoV, with none of the CBS loop remnants protruding above 182 the glycan crown ( Figure  5D -F). While our mass spectrometry data reveals that the N168 site 183 is only 1.6 % occupied, we do observe difference density which extends tangentially from this 184 site. This putative N168 density extends over the entrance to the esterase domain active site 185 ( Figure  5F ). : bioRxiv preprint",

Interestingly, receptor binding site loop deletions have 252 also been reported for H7N2 and H9N2 avian influenza haemagglutinin proteins, and in the 253 latter case were demonstrated to facilitate immune escape 32,33 . In both cases, sialic acid 254 binding was retained but the receptor preference was altered. Also for the HIV-1 envelope 255 glycoprotein, susceptibility to neutralising antibodies is countered by modulating surface 256 exposure and glycosylation pattern of the variable regions 34 . Our findings reinforce the notion 257 that for embecoviruses, the HE, in addition to S, should be considered a viable candidate for 258 vaccine development. Moreover, the highly conserved HE esterase active site offers an 259 attractive target for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals against OC43 and HKU1 as 260 well as against novel human embecoviruses, should such emerge in the future. By 261 demonstrating that cryo-EM can be used to study CoV HEs at high-resolution, we expand the 262 structural biology toolkit for future research, which may focus on antibody or inhibitor 263 complexes.

To better characterise the occupancy and semi-quantitative analysis (Table  S2 ). As expected from HEK293T cell derived materials 26 , 137 glycosylation was predominantly of complex type and very heterogeneous, ranging from 8-59 138 unique glycoforms identified for each site ( Figure 3A ). For sites N145, N168 and N193, 139 situated on the LD loops ( Figure  3B ), we also detected substantial signals for the unmodified 140 asparagines, without glycosylation. Based on the combined signal intensities of all glycoforms, 141 we found that the occupancy of those sites is approximately 81% for N145, <2% for N168 and 142 44% for N193. The low occupancy of N168 agrees with the lack of density observed in the 143 cryo-EM map ( Figure  3C ). Furthermore, the high B-factors of the LD loops suggests flexibility 144 in this region ( Figure  S3E ), which explains the limited density for N110, despite having 100% 145 occupancy. With the exception of N168, the first core N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) was 146 modelled for each of the LD loop glycans ( Figure 3C ). The remaining four sites are fully 147 occupied based on our MS data, in accordance with strong densities observed in the cryo-EM 148 map. Indeed, we were able to model the entire Man3,GlcNAc2 core for N314 ( Figure 3C ). Apart 149 from differences in glycan occupancy, we also observed marked differences in glycan 150 composition. Whereas the overall pattern is dominated by complex glycosylation, sites N83 151 and N328 show predominant hybrid and high-mannose glycosylation, respectively. Sites N110 152 and N145, which contain mostly complex glycans, are also heavily (core) fucosylated and 153 contain higher numbers of sialic acids. Whereas glycosylation varies substantially from site-154 to-site, and is very heterogeneous, we did identify a set of glycan compositions that are highly 155 abundant and shared at the majority of sites, as listed in Supplementary  Table  S3. 156 .

            "text": "6 . It is therefore of relevance to understand how they cross species barriers 189 and subsequently adapt to their new hosts. Viruses in the subgenus Embecovirus, a minor 190 clade in the genus Betacoronavirus, seem particularly apt at crossing species barriers. Two 191 of its members, OC43 and HKU1, arose from separate zoonotic introductions to become firmly loss of HE-mediated receptor-binding, which in turn downregulated HE receptoremerged only recently 13 , HE lectin function was reduced and ultimately lost through 196 accumulation of single site mutations in LD 8 . HKU1 likely followed a similar evolutionary 197 trajectory early upon its entry into the human population, but after several hundreds of years 198 of circulation 11 , the HE LD underwent far more consequential structural changes as revealed 199 here by our cryo-EM analysis. Its overall structure is still highly similar to that of other CoV200 HEs, especially in the ED. Of the LD, the jelly roll core remains intact, but the CBS loops are 201 almost completely gone and, concomitantly, the number of N-linked glycosylation sites 202 increased. The data suggest that during HKU1 evolution, the LD was trimmed back 203 substantially, once it became functionally obsolete. However, the core structure of the LD and 204 the integrity of its fold is essential for the correct folding and function of the esterase domain 205 and so it remains a functional module. The findings beg the question as to why the CBS loops 206 were deleted. One possible explanation is that the protruding surface-exposed regions of the 207 LD, once they lost their function in ligand binding, remained an antigenic liability. Indeed, 208 embecovirus HEs are under selective pressure of the humoral immune response, as 209 antibodies against HE neutralise BCoV and OC43 infectivity in vitro and confer protection 210 against BCoV in vivo 27-30 . The most prominent \u03b25-\u03b26 LD loop of BCoV HE, directly involved in 211 9-O-Ac-Sia binding 15 , is a hotspot for sequence variation (Figure 5A), but apparently remains 212 a target for immune selection even after loss of function, given the sequence variation in this 213 loop also in OC43 HEs (Figure S7). Among type A HEs of contemporary HKU1 field strains, 214 sequence variation in the LD is limited (Figure 5B), but there are considerable differences in encircle the LD. Remarkably, however, the LD dimer interface glycan conserved in BCoV, There are several possible explanations for the newly acquired N-linked glycans, including (i) 225 with loss of the hydrophilic LD loops they add hydrophilicity and thereby aid folding of the 226 hydrophobic core (Figure S9), (ii) they form a glycan shield, and/or (iii) some of them 227 contributed to loss of receptor-binding function early on in HKU1 evolution. With respect to the 228 latter option, the introduction of a glycan at N110 would predictably have sterically hindered 229 receptor binding in the context of a functional LD, as its calculated difference density would 230 have overlapped with the 9-O-Ac-Sia binding site (Figure 6A-B). Indeed, in OC43 HE, the 231 introduction of a glycosylation site at residue 114 in the same loop was one of four mutations 232 acquired early after viral introduction in humans, and which contributed the most to loss of 233 CBS affinity 8 (Figure 6C).",
