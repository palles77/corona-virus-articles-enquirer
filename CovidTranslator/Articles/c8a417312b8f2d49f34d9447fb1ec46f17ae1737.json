Consequently, the calf is born agammaglobulinemic and so depends almost entirely on the absorption of maternal Ig from colostrum after birth. The absorption of maternal Ig across the small intestine during the first 24 hours after birth, termed passive transfer, helps to protect the calf against common disease organisms until its own immature immune system becomes functional. Calves are defined as having failure of passive transfer (FPT) if the calf serum IgG concentration is less than 10 mg/mL when sampled between 24 and 48 hours of age [2, 3] . Achieving early and adequate intake of highquality colostrum is widely recognized as the single most important management factor in determining health and survival of the neonatal calf ( Fig. 1 ) [3] [4] [5] [6] . In addition to reduced risk for preweaning morbidity and mortality, additional long-term benefits associated with successful passive transfer include reduced mortality in the postweaning period, improved rate of gain and feed efficiency, reduced age at first calving, improved first and second lactation milk production, and reduced tendency for culling during the first lactation [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

In the United States mortality rates in preweaned dairy heifers are estimated to range between 8% and 11% [2, 4, 11] . Poor colostrum management is one of the key factors contributing to these excessive losses. In one study 41% of 2177 calves sampled between 24 and 48 hours of age had FPT (serum IgG ! 10 mg/mL) [2] . It was estimated that approximately 31% of preweaning mortality events occurring in the first 3 weeks of life were attributed to FPT [9] . These studies point to the need for producers to adopt practices to improve colostrum management. This article reviews the process of colostrogenesis and discusses important components of colostrum. The key components of developing a successful colostrum management program are discussed.",

This process begins several weeks before calving, under the influence of lactogenic hormones, including prolactin, and ceases abruptly at parturition. Important constituents of colostrum include Ig, maternal leukocytes, growth factors, hormones, cytokines, nonspecific antimicrobial factors, and nutrients. Concentrations of many of these components are greatest in the first secretions harvested after calving (first milking colostrum), then decline steadily over the next six milkings (transition milk) to reach the lower concentrations routinely measured in saleable whole milk (Table 1 ) [12] .",

Although levels are highly variable among cows and studies, one study reported that mean colostral concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM were 75 mg/mL, 4.4 mg/mL, and 4.9 mg/mL, respectively [14] . IgG, and IgG 1 in particular, are transferred from the bloodstream across the mammary barrier into colostrum by a specific transport mechanism: Receptors on the mammary alveolar epithelial cells capture IgG 1 from the extracellular fluid, and the molecule undergoes endocytosis, transport, and finally release into the luminal secretions [13] . The alveolar epithelial cells cease expressing this receptor, most likely in response to increasing prolactin concentrations, at the onset of lactation [15] . Smaller amounts of IgA and IgM are largely derived from local synthesis by plasmacytes in the mammary gland [13] . Although not well understood, colostral transfer of IgE also occurs and may be important in providing early protection against intestinal parasites [16] .",

At least a portion of colostral leukocytes are absorbed intact across the intestinal barrier [18] . Liebler-Tenorio and colleagues [19] reported that the preferential route of uptake of colostral leukocytes through the intestinal barrier is through the follicle-associated epithelium of Peyer patches in the jejunum and ileum. Reber and colleagues [20] proposed that, after entering the neonatal circulation, maternal leukocytes traffic to neonatal nonlymphoid tissues and secondary lymphoid tissues, disappearing from the neonatal circulation by 24 to 36 hours after feeding colostrum. Although their functional importance in calves is not routinely measured, early evidence suggests that colostral leukocytes enhance lymphocyte response to nonspecific mitogens, increase phagocytosis and bacterial killing ability, and stimulate humoral immune responses (IgG formation) in the calf [17, [21] [22] [23] . Presumably these cells would not be viable in pasteurized colostrum or colostrum replacer products. The role and functional significance of colostral leukocytes remains areas of active research.",

The crude fat content of first milking Holstein colostrum (6.7%) is also significantly higher than for milk (3.6%) [12] . Energy from fat and lactose in colostrum is critical for thermogenesis and body temperature regulation. Certain vitamins and minerals, including calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, iron, cobalt, vitamin A, vitamin E, carotene, riboflavin, vitamin B12, folic acid, choline, and selenium are also found in increased concentrations in bovine colostrum versus milk (see Table 1 ) [12, 27] .",

High-quality colostrum has an IgG concentration greater than 50 g/L [6] . The IgG concentration in colostrum can vary dramatically among cows. In one recent study, colostrum IgG averaged 76 g/L, but ranged from 9 to 186 g/L for individual Holstein cows [31] . Some factors affecting colostrum quality, such as breed or age of the dam, may be out of the producer's ability to manipulate. Several other important factors affecting colostrum quality, however, including preparturient vaccination, dry period length, and time to colostrum collection, can be managed by producers. This section reviews factors affecting colostrum quality and discusses cow-side testing of colostrum quality.",

It is difficult to predict, based on such factors as dam parity, weight of colostrum produced at first milking, or visual consistency, which colostrum collected will be of high (O50 g/L IgG) versus low quality [43] . The colostrometer, a hydrometer instrument that estimates IgG concentration by measuring colostrum specific gravity, is one rapid and inexpensive cow-side test that may be useful to differentiate high-from low-quality colostrum (specific gravity O1.050 approximates IgG concentration O50 g/L IgG). Factors such as content of fat and other solids, plus colostrum temperature, affect the hydrometer reading, however. Pritchett and colleagues [55] reported that the sensitivity and specificity of the instrument for detecting low-quality colostrum were 0.32 and 0.97, respectively, meaning that the instrument would incorrectly classify two of every three low-quality colostrum samples as acceptable. Pritchett and colleagues [55] suggested that to avoid misclassification error, producers should alter the hydrometer cutoff points to 45, 60, or 110 g/L if feeding either 3.78, 2.84, or 1.89 L of colostrum at first feeding, respectively. Test specificity would be severely compromised by using higher cutpoints, however, resulting in an excessive portion of colostrums being misclassified as deficient [3] . Others have suggested that if a large enough volume (eg, 3.78 L) is fed at first feeding, then there may be limited value to using a hydrometer. Despite its limitations, the hydrometer may still be useful to differentiate high-from low-quality colostrum used for first versus later feedings, respectively.",

So what volume of colostrum should producers feed to meet or exceed this minimum dose? Obviously the answer to this question depends on the IgG concentration in the colostrum being fed. For example, if colostrum was known to contain 50 g/L IgG, then the producer would only need to feed 1.89 L (2 qt) to achieve the minimum goal of ingesting more than 100 g IgG. If the colostrum contained only 25 g/L of IgG, however, then the producer would need to feed 3.78 L (4 qt) to achieve the same ingested mass of IgG. Besser and colleagues [57] noted that only 36% of colostrum samples tested would be of high enough quality to provide greater than 100 g IgG if calves were only fed 1.89 L. Some 85% of colostrum samples tested would be of high enough quality to provide greater than 100 g IgG if calves were fed 3.78 L, however. Because producers frequently do not know the concentration of IgG in the colostrum being fed, it is currently recommended that calves be fed 10% to 12% of their body weight of colostrum at first feeding (3.78 L for a 43-kg calf). In one study mean serum IgG at 24 hours was significantly higher for calves fed 4 L of high-quality colostrum at 0 hours and a further 2 L at 12 hours (31.1 mg/mL IgG) as compared with calves fed only 2 L of high-quality colostrum at 0 hours and a further 2 L at 12 hours (23.5 mg/mL) (Fig. 2) [58] . Another study reported that Brown Swiss calves fed 3.78 L (versus 1.89 L) of colostrum at first feeding experienced significantly higher rates of average daily gain and greater levels of milk production in both the first and second lactation [10] . In national surveys, 26.1%, 35.9%, and 38.2% of producers reported feeding 4 or more quarts of colostrum within the first 24 hours in 1992, 1996, and 2002, respectively [2, 4, 11] , indicating that increasing the volume of colostrum fed is still an area of opportunity for most dairy producers.",

In a process referred to as ''closure,'' the efficiency of colostral Ig absorption through the intestinal epithelium of the calf decreases linearly with time from birth to completely close at approximately 24 hours [3] . Feeding colostrum after the gut has closed still offers the benefit of local immunity in the gut lumen, but Ig absorption into the circulation no longer occurs.

            "text": "The method of feeding colostrum is worth considering because this can influence the time to first feeding, the volume consumed, and the efficiency of Ig absorption. High rates of FPT have been reported in calves left to suckle the dam [57, 64] . This finding may be attributable to failure of the calf to voluntarily consume a sufficient volume of colostrum and delays in suckling. Edwards and Broom [65] reported that 46% of calves born to second parity and older cows had failed to suckle within 6 hours after birth. By comparison, 11% of calves born to first-calf heifers had failed to suckle within 6 hours after birth. These delays could be caused by numerous factors, including weak or injured cow or calf, mastitis or other illness in the cow, low pendulous udders or large teats, or poor mothering ability. It is for this reason that it is currently recommended that the calf be removed from the dam within 1 to 2 hours of birth, and that the calf then be hand-fed a known volume of colostrum using either a nipple bottle or esophageal feeder [6] . In national surveys, 68.1%, 70.5%, and 76.2% of calves were reportedly fed using a nipple bottle or esophageal tube in 1992, 1996, and 2002, respectively [2, 4, 11] , indicating that progressively fewer producers are relying on suckling the dam for colostrum delivery.",

Although the esophageal feeder method is quicker, it is known that when fluid is given with an esophageal feeder, the esophageal groove reflex is not triggered, resulting in fluid being deposited into the forestomachs. This limitation is not significant, however, because outflow of colostrum from the forestomachs to the abomasum and small intestine occurs for the most part within 3 hours [66] . Adams and colleagues [67] reported that calves fed colostrum using a bottle had only slightly higher serum IgG concentrations versus calves fed with an esophageal feeder, but that these differences were numerically small and statistically insignificant. It is generally accepted that either method of feeding achieves acceptable rates of passive transfer provided a sufficient volume of colostrum is consumed [67, 68] .

This exposure is a concern because pathogenic bacteria in colostrum could cause diseases such as diarrhea or septicemia.

In a study of colostrum harvesting and feeding practices on one dairy, total bacteria counts (TPC cfu/mL) were very low or nil in colostrum stripped directly from the gland (geometric mean udder TPC \u00bc 27.5 cfu/mL). Significant bacterial contamination occurred, however, during the process of milking the colostrum into the bucket (geometric mean bucket TPC \u00bc 97,724 cfu/ mL) [81] .

By comparison, average colostrum bacteria counts remained less than 100,000 cfu/mL for 6 days of refrigeration when colostrum was preserved with potassium sorbate in a 0.5% final solution [81] .

Early studies tried to pasteurize colostrum using the same conventional methods and high temperatures as are typically used to pasteurize milk (63 C [145 F] for 30 minutes or 72 C [161 F] for 15 seconds). This process yielded unacceptable results, however, including thickening or congealing of colostrum and denaturation of approximately one third of colostral IgG [83] . Despite these early setbacks, more recent research has determined that using a lower-temperature, longer-time approach (60 C [140 F] for 60 minutes) to batch-pasteurize colostrum is sufficient to maintain IgG activity and colostrum fluid characteristics, while eliminating or significantly reducing important pathogens including E. coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Mycoplasma bovis and Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis [82, 84] . In one recent on-farm controlled study, calves fed pasteurized colostrum (60 C \u00c2 60 minutes) experienced a significant reduction in colostrum bacterial exposure and significantly higher serum IgG levels at 24 hours of age versus calves fed 3.8 L of raw colostrum [77] . If stored in a clean covered container, the shelf life of pasteurized refrigerated colostrum is at least 8 to 10 days [85] . The potential short-and longterm health and economic benefits of feeding pasteurized colostrum have not yet been described.",

            "text": "Farms can occasionally experience periods in which an adequate supply of clean, high-quality, fresh or stored colostrum is not available to feed to all newborn calves. Contributing to this problem, some producers may discard colostrum from cows that test positive for M avium subsp paratuberculosis, bovine leukosis virus, or M bovis mastitis. Under such circumstances, using colostrum supplements (CS) or colostrum replacement (CR) products may offer producers a convenient way to improve levels of passive immunity in calves while reducing the risk for pathogen exposure through colostrum. Powdered commercial CS or CR products contain bovine Ig that is typically either lacteal-or plasma-derived. It is recommended that CS or CR products be mixed in water (according to label directions) and fed as a separate meal after any natural colostrum has been fed [6] . There are important differences between the less expensive CS products ($5-$7 per dose) and more expensive CR products ($25-$30 per dose). Colostrum supplement products typically contain less than 50 g IgG per dose, contain no nutrient pack, and are only intended to supplement (not replace) existing colostrum. If given alone, feeding CS products results in significantly lower serum Ig and greater risk for FPT in calves as compared with feeding fresh colostrum [86] . There is no added benefit of feeding CS products if already feeding 3 to 4 L of high-quality bovine colostrum [87, 88] . By comparison, CR products contain a minimum of 100 g IgG per dose, provide a nutritional source of protein, energy, vitamins, and minerals, and are designed to completely replace (or feed in the absence of) maternal colostrum [89] .",

In a controlled study of 12 dairy herds in Minnesota and Wisconsin, Swan and colleagues [31] reported that 239 commercial dairy calves fed a commercially available CR product (Acquire, American Protein Corporation, Inc., Ames, Iowa) had significantly lower serum IgG concentrations (5.8 mg/mL IgG) than 218 calves fed maternal colostrum (14.8 mg/ mL IgG). Although a trend was present, the preweaning morbidity and mortality rates were not different for calves fed CR (morbidity \u00bc 59.6%; mortality \u00bc 12.4%) versus calves fed maternal colostrum (morbidity \u00bc 51.9%; mortality \u00bc 10%). Other studies have reported better rates of successful passive transfer (mean serum IgG O10.0 mg/mL), particularly when calves were fed two doses of CR product [89, 92] . In one such study, the average 24-hour serum IgG level for calves fed either one dose (100 g IgG) or two doses (200 g IgG) of a lacteal-derived CR, or 3.78 L of maternal colostrum, were 11.6, 16.9, and 27.2 mg/mL IgG, respectively (Land O' Lakes Colostrum Replacement, Land O' Lakes Inc., St. Paul, Minnesota) [93] . Feeding higher doses of CR products may increase the rate of successful passive transfer, but the cost-benefit of this practice has yet to be described. Similarly, the effectiveness and cost-benefit of routinely using CR products in Johne's or other infectious disease control programs has yet to be described. Because of the highly variable performance among different products, veterinarians should review results of peer-reviewed controlled trials when selecting a CR product.",

The refractometer instrument costs approximately $250 (USD). In an early study of 185 calves, STS had a good correlation with serum IgG concentration as measured using RID (R 2 \u00bc 0.72) [98] . Calloway and colleagues [99] , reported that STS concentration test endpoints of 5.0 and 5.2 g/dL yielded the most accurate results in estimating the adequacy of passive transfer as defined by serum IgG 10.0 mg/mL or greater (sensitivity O0.80; specificity O0.80; proportion classified correctly O0.85). In that study lower or higher test endpoints misclassified larger numbers of calves. Because STS results do result in periodic misclassification of individual calves, the use of STS results as an individual animal diagnostic tool is discouraged. When results are interpreted at the group or herd level, however, STS results accurately reflect the proportion of calves that have FPT, thereby making it a useful on-farm tool for monitoring whether the colostrum management program is succeeding. It is recommended that serum samples be collected from a minimum of 12 clinically normal (not scouring) calves between 24 hours and 7 days of age [6] . Wallace and colleagues [100] reported that the results of STS refractometry from centrifuge-and noncentrifuge-harvested sources of serum were highly correlated (R 2 \u00bc 0.95), so producers can conduct this test onfarm without need of a centrifuge. McGuirk and Collins [6] suggest that a goal is for 80% or more of calves tested to meet or exceed a STS cutpoint of 5.5 g/dL. Tyler suggests that 90% or more of calves tested should meet or exceed the more accurate STS cutpoint of 5.0 g/dL (J Tyler, personal communication, 2002). If it is determined that a disproportionate number of calves have FPT, then the veterinarian and producer must investigate to identify and then correct the root causes of FPT within the colostrum management program. In addition to periodically sampling groups of calves to assess FPT, producers can also periodically submit frozen colostrum samples to a microbiology laboratory for culture. A goal is for a majority of samples submitted to have at total bacteria count of less than 100,000 cfu/mL and a total coliform count less than 10,000 cfu/mL [6] .",

            "text": "Colostrum management is the single most important management factor in determining calf health and survival. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of North American dairy calves suffer from failure of passive transfer, contributing to excessively high preweaning mortality. There is considerable opportunity for most dairy producers to improve their colostrum management practices, resulting in improved short-and long-term health and performance of the animal. A successful colostrum management program requires producers to consistently provide calves with a sufficient volume of clean, high-quality colostrum within the first few hours of life. Colostrum replacers are useful tools if a sufficient quantity of clean, high-quality maternal colostrum is not available. Ongoing monitoring helps producers to more quickly identify and correct problems within the colostrum management program.",
