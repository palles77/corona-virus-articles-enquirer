No laboratory animal model is yet been developed in porcine coronaviruses study. Here, we report that development of a transgenic mouse model expressing porcine APN which is susceptible to porcine coronavirus infection. The porcine APN transgene was constructed by fusing with mouse proximal APN promoter at 5 terminus and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation site at its 3 terminus. After screen on pubs from the microinjected mice, we confirmed two transgenic lines expressing porcine APN in various organs. We confirmed the susceptibility to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, one of the porcine coronaviruses. These transgenic mice will be an important tool for research into the porcine coronaviruses.",

PRCoV is reported to be an attenuated variant of TGEV. PRCoV infects lung epithelial cells, and PRCoV antigen has been found in type I and type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages, and infection is followed by interstitial pneumonia (Halbur et al., 1993; Saif, 2004a,b) . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, which is characterized by watery diarrhea, as is TGEV infection (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978; Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Turgeon et al., 1980) . PEDV-infected piglets usually show typical enteric signs, including profuse watery diarrhea, weight loss, and loss of milk uptake, entailing high mortality. PEDV has been reported in Europe and Asia, and also recently in the United States (Hess et al., 1980; Huang et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2012; Park et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014) . All these porcine coronaviruses belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus. A hemagglutinating enteric coronavirus, a member of the genus Betacoronavirus, is antigenically unrelated to the other porcine coronaviruses and uses a 5-Nacetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic-acid-containing moiety as its cellular receptor.",

Most Alphacoronavirus, including TGEV, PEDV, and PRCoV, use aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) as their cellular receptor (Delmas et al., 1992; Li et al., 2007; Ren et al., 2010; Tresnan and Holmes, 1998; Yeager et al., 1992) .

However, in vivo studies using suckling piglets have many disadvantages, including their high cost, difficulty in handling the piglets, limited reagents, etc. Because the use of laboratory animal models (e.g., mouse models) can circumvent these limitations, several transgenic animal models have been generated to study porcine viruses (Benbacer et al., 1998; Ono et al., 2006) . Here, we generated transgenic mice expressing porcine APN under the control of the mouse proximal APN promoter. We tested their susceptibility to PEDV with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunochemical analyses, and found that the porcine APN transgenic mice were susceptible to PEDV infection.",

The porcine APN cDNA was amplified from porcine enterocytes and tagged at the C-terminus with the Flag epitope to distinguish exogenously expressed porcine APN from endogenously expressed murine APN. The 2.9-kb Flag-epitopetagged porcine APN cDNA was cloned into the pBluescript KS (+) vector under the control of a 1.1-kb genomic sequence containing the mouse proximal APN promoter. The splice sites and polyadenylation signal for the cDNA were provided by a 0.2-kb bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (BGH-PolyA). The expression of the porcine APN protein was detected with immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting in 293T cells transfected with the porcine APN transgene. The Flag-tagged recombinant protein, with a molecularweight of about 150 kDa (the expected molecular mass for porcine APN), was confirmed with immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B) . We also measured the surface expression of porcine APN with flow cytometry using an anti-Flag antibody, and found that 21.3% of cells were Flag-positive (Fig. 2C ). Our data demonstrate that the mouse proximal APN promoter efficiently induced porcine APN expression from our construct.",

The small intestines expressed a recombinant protein with the molecular mass expected for porcine APN (Fig. 4B ). An immunohistochemical analysis, with both anti-Flag and anti-porcine APN antibodies, clearly confirmed porcine APN expression in the brush borders of the absorptive cells in the small intestines of the mouse model (Fig. 4C) . These results demonstrate that the porcine APN transgenic mice expressed porcine APN in their small intestines. We also screened for porcine APN expression in various other tissues with RT-PCR. Porcine APN mRNA was strongly expressed in the lung, kidney, and the intestine, and was slightly expressed in the liver (Fig. 5A) . The extracellular expression of porcine APN was examined in the kidney and liver by FACS analysis (Fig. 5B) . Consistent with the RT-PCR results, the number of Flag-positive renal cells was significantly higher (2-4.3-fold) in the porcine APN transgenic mice than in the nontransgenic wild-type mice, whereas the number of Flag-positive hepatic cells was also slightly higher (1.6-3-fold) In summary, we confirmed the expression of porcine APN in the small intestines, lungs, livers, and kidneys of the porcine APN transgenic mice.",

Unlike in vitro cell culture systems, laboratory animal models offer researchers invaluable opportunities to study the biological, pathological, and histological characteristics of human and animal diseases. For these purposes, many transgenic mouse models have been developed to study viral pathogenesis, immune responses, and vaccines (Darling et Both wild type and porcine APN transgenic mice were infected with PEDV (5X TCID5010 6 ) orally on day 0. Two mice from each group were killed daily up to 5 days, and intestine samples were collected and prepared for titration. Titration was done using Vero cells. Y value is PEDV titer in TCID50 in log value. Reynaud et al., 2014) . In the field of coronavirus research, studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human coronavirus 229E (hCoV-229E) have been conducted with transgenic mouse models (Lassnig et al., 2005; Tseng et al., 2007) . The host range of the porcine coronaviruses is strongly limited to pigs, so pigs are the only animals available in which to study viral pathogenesis. However, in vivo experiments using pigs are relatively challenging because they require special treatments, reagents, and facilities. Because most porcine coronaviruses use porcine APN as their receptor, we generated porcine APN transgenic mice, which are susceptible to porcine coronaviruses. We constructed the porcine APN transgene by attaching the mouse proximal APN promoter to the 5 terminus of the porcine APN gene and the BGH-polyA signal at its 3 terminus. We thus generated porcine APN transgenic mice expressing porcine APN in the brush borders of their small intestines and various tissues (lungs and kidneys).",

Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea have been limited to few countries in East Asia in the cold season, whereas it has spread to most swine farms in the Asian region (Mole, 2013; Pan et al., 2012; Park et al., 2013; Song and Park, 2012; Stevenson et al., 2013) . Recently, PEDV has also spread rapidly among swine farms in the United States, causing high piglet mortality in more than 17 states (Huang et al., 2013; Mole, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014) . More importantly, although vaccination is practiced on most swine farms in Korea, reported outbreaks are still increasing. Moreover, a method for isolating wild-type PEDV is not well established. For these reasons, we tested the susceptibility of porcine APN transgenic mice to PEDV. Although significant clinical illness was not observed when the transgenic mice were infected with PEDV, their susceptibility to the virus was confirmed by the detection of viral RNA in various organs with RT-PCR and viral proteins in the small intestines with IHC. More clearly, PEDV replication was confirmed by increase in viral titer up to 5 days PI compared to those in wild type mice. We could found clear increase in viral titer in the small intestines of pAPN transgenic mice but not from wild type mice. These results also confirmed that porcine APN plays a role as the cellular receptor for PEDV. However, similar experiments using other porcine coronaviruses are required.",

            "text": "Although we have presented evidence of PEDV infection in the small intestines of porcine APN transgenic mice, no clinical signs were observed, apart from moderately soft feces. It has previously been shown that PEDV can infect cells lacking extracellular trypsin, although trypsin is essential for the generation of a cytopathic effect (CPE) in infected cells (Park et al., 2011) . Therefore, we assume that cellular cofactors (e.g., trypsin) other than the primary receptor might be involved in and required for PEDV pathogenesis in vivo. However, these factors are probably present at insufficient levels in mice. Proteases are generally required for efficient viral entry and the CPEs of coronaviruses (Matsuyama et al., 2005; Simmons et al., 2004 Simmons et al., , 2013 . Although the viral receptors are usually expressed in various organs, the diseases caused by coronavirus infections are limited to the small intestines and/or lungs, which are enriched cellular proteases. This suggests that proteases play a role in the pathogenesis of the coronaviruses in vivo, as is already well established for influenza virus infections (Hatesuer et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2014; Tarnow et al., 2014) .",
