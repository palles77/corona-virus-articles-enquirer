Failure to isolate pathogenic organisms from the infected stools of such patients does not conclusively demonstrate that the illness was not infectious. For instance, these individuals may have been infected but the organism cleared from the gut at the time the samples were obtained for testing.'07 For cost-containment purposes, some diagnostic laboratories do not test for all known enteropathogens but focus their isolation procedures on those organisms that historically have been identified most commonly in the .local community. For example, despite increasingly widespread acceptance of enterohemorrhagic Eschevichia coli as a recognized cause of disease, not all medical centers or commercial laboratories routinely test for these organisms in standard stool cultures3",

For example, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli infections were not recognized as a major health concern until the organisms could be cultured routinely on selective medium under microaerophilic culture condition^.^^ The selective media that are used contain antibiotics to suppress the growth of the fecal microflora while permitting the replication of resistant campylobacters. The limitation of the technique is that intestinal campylobacters that are sensitive to the antibiotics in the selective culture medium are not identified. For example, Campylobacter upsaliensis likely is an important cause of disease that is underdiagnosed because standard methods for culturing intestinal campylobacters use antibiotics to which this organism is sensitive. 4O The lack of suitable culture techniques to successfully grow some microbes is another possible reason for the failure to identify enteropathogens. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to identify nonculturable microbial pathogens, including, for example, the Whipple's bacillus in intestinal biopsy specimens. 84, 85 This technology also has demonstrated that microbial pathogens can cause gastric disease in the absence of enterocolitic symptoms.",

Studies using animal models have reported evidence both fors6, 89 and the role of Verocytotoxins in experimentally induced enterocolitis. If these toxins are important in beginning the cascade that results in a systemic disease, preventing toxin binding to enterocyte receptors may interrupt the pathophysiology of this disease. The hypothesis that receptor analog therapy is an effective and safe form of treatment to prevent the systemic complications of EHEC infection is now being tested.93 This or other novel treatment approaches are required because antimicrobial agents are of unproven benefit. Theoretically, antibiotics could cause harm because the cytotoxins are released from the periplasm of the organism following exposure to agents that disrupt the prokaryotic outer membrane. An increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance among EHEC isolates also has been recently d e~c r i b e d .~~ EHEC attach to infected epithelial cells in vitro and in experimental animals in a morphologically distinct pattern referred to as attaching and effacing adhesion (Fig. 5) .29, lo* The attaching and effacing lesion is dependent on a chromosomally encoded bacterial outer membrane protein. 22 The role of the outer membrane protein in mediating EHEC-induced diarrheal disease is under active investigation because the adhesin is a potential vaccine candidate. Whether all cytotoxin-producing strains induce the attaching and effacing lesion is doubtful. The authors have reported, for example, that Verocytotoxin-producing E coli of the serotype 0113:H21 does not contain a homologous gene for the outer membrane adhesin and does not cause attaching and effacing adhesion either in vitro or in vivo.28",

Inhibitors of chemokine production or inhibition of the biologic effects of neutrophil chemoattractants have the potential to reduce both mucosal inflammatory responses and the attendant clinical sequelae.
