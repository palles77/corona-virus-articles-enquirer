In this study, we examined the role of CEACAM1 in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Treatment of C57BL/6J mice with CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein, a homophilic ligand of CEACAM1, inhibited the severity of EAE and reduced myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-derived peptide (MOG 35-55 )reactive interferon-\u2425 and interleukin-17 production. In contrast, treatment of these animals with AgB10, an anti-mouse CEACAM1 blocking monoclonal antibody, generated increased severity of EAE in association with increased MOG 35-55 -specific induction of both interferon-\u2425 and interleukin-17. These results indicated that the signal elicited through CEACAM1 ameliorated EAE disease severity. Furthermore, we found that there was both a rapid and enhanced expression of CEACAM1 on invariant natural killer T cells after activation. The effect of CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein and anti-CEACAM1 mAb on both EAE and MOG 35 Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), also known as CD66a, is one of the carcinoembryonic antigen family members and is expressed in epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and hematopoietic cells such as monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and activated T cells. [1] [2] [3] [4] It is involved in intercellular adhesion through homophilic or heterophilic interactions and mediates regulatory functions in cellular growth and differentiation. Several splice variants of CEACAM1 have been detected, that differ with respect to the number of extracellular immunoglobulinlike domains, membrane anchorage, and the length of their cytoplasmic tail. 3 Isoforms of CEACAM1 with a long cytoplasmic tail (CEACAM1-L) contain two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs and have been shown to negatively regulate epithelial cell activation and tumor cell growth. [3] [4] [5] Recently, the specific function of CEACAM1 as a regulator of T cells has been reported in vitro and in vivo. 6 -12 Mice treated with CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein, a homophilic ligand for CEACAM1 that stimulates the signal from CEACAM1, exhibited an immunosuppressive effect on Th1-mediated colitis in vivo, with reduced interferon (IFN)-\u2425 production and T-bet activation. 12 However, the significance of CEACAM1 on other inflammatory autoimmune disease models remains unclear.",

            "text": "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease induced by sensitization against central nervous system (CNS) components such as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). 13 Because the neurological signs of paralysis can be monitored continuously, and demyelinating lesions resemble those found in multiple sclerosis, EAE is considered an animal model of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. [13] [14] [15] [16] Numerous studies have reported that EAE is mediated by CD4 \u03e9 Th1 cells that produce IFN-\u2425. [13] [14] [15] [16] Recently, this idea was questioned because animals deficient in IFN-\u2425, IFN-\u2425 receptor, or signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 were still found to develop EAE. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] These data led the identification of an interleukin (IL)-23 derived population of Th cells, IL-17-producing Th17 cells, as alternative potent inducers of severe autoimmunity, including EAE. [22] [23] [24] However, mice deficient in T-bet and signal transducer and activator of transcription 4, which thus lack Th1 cells, but have large numbers of Th17 cells, are still resistant to EAE. 21, 25 Additionally, Th1 and Th17 cells are observed in the CNS at the peak of EAE and diminish after the recovery. 26 It has now been described that Th1 and Th17 cells might cooperate to induce the development of EAE. [27] [28] [29] Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate the production of both Th1 and Th17 cytokines is important in relation to the regulation of EAE.",

            "text": "The present study demonstrated that the signal through CEACAM1 suppressed EAE in association with a reduction in MOG 35-55 -specific production of IFN-\u2425 and IL-17. Moreover, we showed that CEACAM1 was expressed at an early time point by iNKT cells after activation and CEACAM1 also affected the cytokine production by iNKT cells, including IFN-\u2425, but not IL-4. Finally, we demonstrated that CEACAM1-mediated modulation of EAE and MOG 35-55 -specific cytokine production required iNKT cells.",

            "text": "Since both IFN-\u2425 and IL-17 are known as potent inducers of EAE, 21,27-29 CEACAM1-mediated reduction of these cytokines is thought to have a significant role in ameliorating EAE. Although the mechanisms of IFN-\u2425 and IL-17 reduction in CEACAM1-mediated suppression of EAE are not clearly defined so far, we found that the effects of AgB10 and CEACAM1-Fc fusion proteins on EAE and MOG 35-55 -reactive cytokine responses were abolished in iNKT cell-deficient J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Thus we concluded that CEACAM1-mediated suppression of EAE was mediated via iNKT cells. Activation of iNKT cells are known to modulate dendritic cell functions, and Kammerer et al reported that AgB10 triggered release of IL-12 from dendritic cells and facilitated priming of naive CD4 \u03e9 T cells with a Th1-like phenotype. 36 In contrast, Iijima et al showed that CEACAM1-mediated inhibition of Th1-mediated colitis was not dependent on the modulation of IL-12, consistent with this finding, IL-12 was not affected in EAE-induced mice by the in vivo treatment of AgB10. Since iNKT cells have been shown to produce IL-21, which promotes the development of Th17 cells, 37 CEACAM1 expression by iNKT cells may have a regulatory role in IL-17 production by Th17 cells via IL-21. However, the production of IL-21 upon iNKT cell activation was not altered by treatment with AgB10. In addition, production of IL-23, which promotes Th17 cell maintenance by activated iNKT cells was not altered in mice treated with AgB10, as compared with control mice. Therefore, the mechanisms how CEACAM1-treated iNKT cells modulate MOG reactive Th1 and Th17 cells remain to be elucidated.",

            "text": "Recently, Mars et al reported that activation of iNKT cells with \u2423-GarCer during priming of the CD4 \u03e9 T cell response prevents the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4 \u03e9 T cells toward the Th17 lineage, and the cytokine neutralization experiments indicated that IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-\u2425 are involved in the iNKT cell-mediated regulation of T cell lineage development. 38 Although the direct mechanisms of iNKT cells in regulating the Th17 compartment are still in question, iNKT cells were shown to have a regulatory role in development of the Th17 lineage. Our laboratory reported that antibiotic treatment alters the composition of gut flora, resulting in amelioration of EAE in a iNKT cell-dependent manner. 39 iNKT cell-dependent amelioration of EAE was associated with the suppression of MOG 35-55 -reactive Th17 cells, although the mechanism by which iNKT cells modulate MOG 35-55 -reactive Th17 cells remained unclear. It was speculated that altering the compositions of gut flora by antibiotic treatment critically influences the function of iNKT cells, which resulted in a reduction of MOG 35-55 -reactive Th17 cells. Since various bacterial and viral pathogens trans-ligate CEACAM1 and suppresses the activation and proliferation of T cells, it is possible that the alteration of cytokine production in physiological or pathological conditions is partly dependent on the way of trans-ligation of pathogens and CEACAM1 on iNKT cells. 3,12,40 -45 In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that CEACAM1 negatively regulates the severity of EAE via an iNKT cell-dependent mechanism. Considering that the selective induction of cytokines by iNKT cells by synthetic ligands has been reported to suppress EAE, 32, 46 CEACAM1 may prove to be a novel target for immunotherapy of multiple sclerosis.",
