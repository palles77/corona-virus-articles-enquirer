The possibility of genetic recombination in such viruses was first suggested many years ago by Hirst (1962) and Ledinko (1963) , who showed that infection of cells with a mixture of inhibitor-sensitive variants of poliovirus resulted in an enhanced yield of resistant progeny that were genetically stable. Similar observations were made with aphthovirus (or foot-and-mouth disease virus) in this laboratory (Pringle, 1965) . However, with the exception of retroviruses, which are presumed to recombine as a DNA intermediate, recombination has not been demonstrated in any other family of unsegmented RNA virus despite extensive investigation.",

The 0, parent, ts33, had a temperature-sensitive mutation that was associated with an altered structural polypeptide VP2 (King et al., 19801 , encoded near the 5' end of the genome. For the other parent, a mutant of subtype OS with a temperature-sensitive mutation at the 3' end of the genome was sought. Several spontaneous temperature-sensitive mutants of subtype OS were isolated and screened by electrofocusing polypeptides induced in virus-infected cells. One mutant, ts302, induced an altered nonstructural polypeptide, P56a, which is encoded at the 3' end of the genome. Figure 1 illustrates the electrofocusing patterns produced by the polypeptides of the two wild-type strains and the parental mutants, ts33 and ts302. Conditions of labeling and sample preparation were designed to give simple patterns of stable virus-specific polypeptides, for ease of comparison in one dimension. Polypeptides were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis as described below. As Figure 1 shows, the 0, temperature-sensitive mutant differed from the 0, wild-type only in VP2, and in the precursor of VP2, P38, whereas the Oa temperature-sensitive mutant differed from the OS wild-type only in P56a. The latter alteration was shown to be due to the temperaturesensitive defect by examining the polypeptides of ts+ revertants of the O6 parent. Each of six spontaneous revertants demonstrated covariation between the charge change in P56a and the temperature-sensitive defect (data not shown). Significantly, none of these revertants showed any resemblance to the 0, polypeptide pattern.",

The genetic location of ts303, used in cross (21, was not known, but several ts+ revertants of ts303 were found to have an electrophoretically altered VP3, suggesting that this mutant had a temperature-sensitive defect of the coat proteins.

The origin of electrofocusing is on the left. among closely related aphthoviruses (King et al., 1981) . As Figure 1 shows, large differences between the subtypes were seen in the isoelectric points of all six major polypeptides, and these differences were exploited as markers for studying recombination. Since the 0, parent was defective in VP2 and the OS parent in P56a, f.s+ recombinants would be expected to inherit an O6 VP2 and an 0, P56a. Out of 22 ts+ progeny, 16 possessed these hybrid characteristics. Since each clone was derived from a separate infected cell, these recombinant viruses were all products of independent genetic crossovers. The recombinants were of two types, termed Ret 1 and Ret 2, and an example of each is shown in Figure  1 . Two were of the Ret 1 variety, having inherited all their structural polypeptides VP1 , VP2, VP3 and P38, from the O6 parent, and both nonstructural polypeptides, P34 and P56a, from the 0, parent. The other 14 recombinants were of the Ret 2 type, in which all six polypeptides except P56a were inherited from the OS parent. The remaining six ts+ progeny were indistinguishable from the O6 wild-type and were presumably revertants of the O6 parent, fs302. An alternative possibility is that these fs+ viruses were produced by pairs of genetic crossovers on either side of the OS temperature-sensitive mutation. Ret 1 was the most interesting type of presumptive recombinant, since it appeared to have been generated either by a genetic crossover in the middle of the genome or by a minimum of two separate mutations. A more complete analysis of the induced polypeptides of Ret 1 was therefore undertaken by two-dimensional electrophoresis of whole cytoplasmic extracts prepared from pulse-labeled virus-infected cells, as shown in Figure 2 . Under the conditions used, most of the virus-induced polypeptides, precursors as well as products, were labeled. Identification of the larger virus polypeptides in two-dimensional gels has been described by King et al. (1982) . The small polypeptides P12, P16, P20a and P20b were identified from their electrophoretic mobilities in the SDS gel dimension. In both subtypes, P20a appeared as two spots differing in isoelectric point.",

The results confirmed the differences seen earlier in one dimension ( Figure 1 ) and revealed further subtype-specific differences in all the other virus-coded polypeptides except for P12, P20b and P88. The absence of a difference in P88, the precursor of the structural proteins, was presumably because differences among its constituent polypeptides cancelled each other out. To improve resolution of the smaller polypeptides, all six analyses of Figure 2 were repeated with a higher concentration of polyacrylamide in the SDS gel (not shown); these gels confirmed the conservation of P12 and P20b. The acidic polypeptide VP4 does not enter these electrofocusing gels, but the isoelectric point of this polypeptide is known to be highly conserved (King et al., 1981) . Differences among the other polypeptides were predominantly in the electrofocusing (horizontal) dimension. Thus the polypeptides of the two subtype strains differed greatly in isoelectric point but not in size. The subtype origins of Ret 1 polypeptides were determined by running mixtures of Ret 1 and parental extracts. As can be seen from the Ret 1 + 0, mixture, polypeptides P16, P20a, VP1 , VP3 and P38 of the recombinant differed from their 0, counterparts in exactly the same way as the two parents differed from each other, showing that these five polypeptides (indicated by open arrows on the Ret 1 gel) were inherited from the O6 parent. In contrast, the same mixture gave rise to only single polypeptide spots for the other nonconserved polypeptides, P34, P52, P56a, P72 and Pl 00, showing that these were inherited from the 0, parent (solid arrows on the Ret 1 gel). As expected, the situation was reversed in the Ret 1 + OS mixture-the two viruses were indistinguishable in the former group of polypeptides, but were different in the latter.",

It will not be possible to decide between these alternatives until the oligonucleotides have been located more precisely in the parental nucleotide sequences. However, our results leave little room for doubt that recombination between RNA molecules really can occur, for several reasons. First, the aphthovirus genome consists of a single molecule of single-stranded RNA, and most of the fingerprints in this study were obtained from fulllength fractions of virus RNA. Second, the RNA is replicated in the cytoplasm with no requirement for DNA synthesis. Third, the hybrid oligonucleotide patterns of Ret 1 and Ret 2 showed no evidence of virus mixtures. Finally, the same genetic crossovers were inferred independently from the inheritance of viruscoded proteins and were as predicted from the locations of the parental temperature-sensitive lesions. By using the infectious center method, up to one third of cells infected with a mixture of temperaturesensitive viruses have yielded ts+ progeny (McCahon and Slade, 1981) . Since most ts+ progeny of the intersubtypic cross proved to be genuine recombinants, RNA recombination appears to be a normal concomitant of picornavirus replication. It should be emphasized that this cross is far from unique. We are currently exploiting recombination between these two virus strains for the purpose of mapping guanidineresistance mutations. Thus far, crosses between six different pairs of mutants have been carried out and each has yielded viruses with recombinant genomes (K. Saunders, unpublished observations) .

The latter can be extremely complex (Lehtovaara et al., 1981) , and one DI RNA of influenza virus has even been found to consist of sequences derived from more than one genome segment (Fields and Winter, 1982) . Although splicing involves the breakage and rejoining of an RNA chain, explanations for the production of DI RNAs usually invoke a \"promiscuous\" polymerase, which jumps from one region of template to another without terminating replication (Lazzarini et al., 1981) .

The appropriate juxtaposition of homologous sequences would occur whenever RNA molecules from two different viruses become hybridized to a single complementary strand. This situation could arise in various ways, for example, by a negative strand of RNA hybridizing to virion RNAs derived from both parents, or, alternatively, by hybridizing to a nascent positive strand in the replicative intermediate.",

            "text": "The existence of a genetic recombination map implies that crossovers can occur at many different places in the aphthovirus genome; indeed, the assumption behind recombination mapping is that crossovers are randomly located. In contrast, only a limited variety of recombinants was produced by crossing two different subtype strains, despite the fact that the parental temperature-sensitive mutations were at opposite ends of the genome. This suggests that recombination between subtypes is restricted to limited regions of the genome, a limitation reflected in the much lower recombination frequency from this cross compared with the result obtained with isogenic parents. More work will be needed to define the nature of these constraints, although it may be significant that the only crossovers that did occur were in regions coding for the conserved polypeptides, P12 and P20b. The fact that all the polypeptides of the 16 recombinants resembled one or other of the parental electrophoretic types suggests that there may be functional constraints on the generation of recombinant polypeptides with novel biochemical properties. What purpose does RNA recombination serve? One possibility is that recombination acts as an RNA repair mechanism by reconstructing complete genomes from overlapping fragments. The rescue of genetic markers from ultraviolet-inactivated viruses (Pringle, 1965 ) and the surprisingly low dependence of recombination frequency on multiplicity of infection (McCahon and Slade, 1981) give some credence to this idea. Our finding that genetic information can be exchanged between different virus subtypes raises a second possibility-that recombination is a natural source of genetic diversity among aphthoviruses.",
