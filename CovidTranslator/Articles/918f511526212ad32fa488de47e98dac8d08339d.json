In which form part of the N-terminal extended \u2424 chain, clipping onto the edge of the inner \u2424 sheet (strand 6) one of the dimers, the interface is principally formed by the parallel association of the C-terminal \u2423 helices from its dimer partner (see Figure 3A ). This interaction effectively forms two six-stranded \u2424 sheets that run ( Figures 1C and 3A) . This dimer has overall dimensions of 70 \u03eb 40 \u03eb 40 \u00c5 , and a total surface area of 1240 \u00c5 2 across the dimer interface, locking the dimer together.

This surface area drops to 990 \u00c5 2 on exclusion of the N-terminal the end of the C-terminal helix, which may account for a kink in the \u2423 helices, bending them away from the tag (AREAIMOL [CCP4, 1994] ). We would expect that in the absence of the N-terminal tag residues 1-3 at the dimer interface.
