These information-centric, heterarchically structured networks are instantiated in response to major disasters with global impact. The instantiation of GCN is conceived as a problem of collective action. Its success depends on multi-level preparedness, and network orchestration and participation. With this framework we analyze the SARS outbreak in 2002 and its successful containment in 2003. We analyze two individual country cases, Canada and China and discuss the role of the network orchestrator, the World Health Organizations. The paper concludes with implications for research and practice.",

These pressing causes exceed the (dynamic) capacity and resources of single organizations or even alliances and partnerships [53, 65] . In the private sector, well known examples of (global) interorganizational networks include clothing, aviation, car manufacturing, electronics and service [14] industries. Examples of public networking are disaster relief [70] , global aviation security regulations, healthcare [34] , disease control management, military (coalition-based) campaigns [2, 86] , and international law enforcement. These interorganizational networkscoined as Hastily Formed Global Networks [24] have been enabled by globalization and the advancement of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) [77] . These resources do not guarantee successful performance at the network level. The multi-agent US government response to the Katrina disaster was considered unsuccessful [19, 36] , as were many international relief efforts to a certain degree [23] . Other unexpected major disasters such as the Tsunami in the Indian Ocean in December 2004, and the devastating earthquake in Kashmir in October 2005 revealed the global need for a deeper understanding of network coordination in response to unexpected major disasters.",

Theoretically, our study starts, introduces and builds on the notion of instantiation. This concept distinguishes our conceptualization of networks from frequently used concepts like building and emergence in network research. Building explicitly refers to the human act of creation, and emergence connotes a result from indeterminate, evolutionary forces. By instantiation, however, we mean the evocation of available resources in an unprecedented way to achieve a common (network) goal. In this process, information sharing plays a pivotal role: representations of actors, issues, opportunities, and constraints are shared instantaneously, on a global scale, allowing network actors to adjust and fine-tune their activities [20] . We therefore call GCNs information-centric. Empirically, we analyze the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) case in order to learn how GCNs can be successful. We focus on the relationships between two countries as individual network participants (Canada and China) and the global network (World Health Organization).",

Human-induced crises differ from natural crises with respect to the extent to which they can be controlled and prevented. The former are caused by human, communication and technical failures. The causes of human-induced crises are not just triggered by one event but are also closely related to the way organizations respond. Inadequate or unprepared responses may deteriorate the crisis situation. Shrivastava and Mitroff [68] therefore argue that crises are caused by two interacting sets of failures. On one hand a complex set of human, organizational and technological (HOT) factors trigger the crisis, and on the other hand organizations encounter regulatory, infrastructural and preparedness (RIP) failures. Vaughan's [78] analysis of the disaster with the space shuttle Challenger in 1986 provides an interesting example of the intricate interplay between the HOT and RIP factors. The impacts of natural crises are mostly limited to a geographic region and specific time periods. Human-induced crises may transcend geographic boundaries and even may have trans-generational impact (e.g. Chernobyl, Bhopal).",

Weick [84] points to the fundamental problem in creating this high-quality intelligence. He argues that action is instrumental to understanding a crisis. People enact the environment which constrains them at the same time. Only through action one learns to understand the nature of the crisis, while at the same time it affects the unfolding of the crisis itself. While most of this research deals with local, single site crises, recently the global reach and capability of pooling and disseminating information has become apparent. Media play a pivotal role in communicating crises as they shape public perceptions and responses to crises [68] . In most crisis situation, however, the quality of intelligence is put under pressure: coverage of crises by the media, individuals and groups is often fragmented. Objective data is lacking, leaving stakeholders merely with equivocal impressions [68] .",

The ability to prepare adequately depends on the nature of the crisis situation. Preparation presumes the ability of foresight and prediction. In the case of small-scale disasters, emergency agencies can rely on protocols, network infrastructures and professional, highly trained teams ready to respond [24] . With large scale, unprecedented disasters the required response exceeds beyond the control and capabilities of one or more emergency agencies. A response organization still has to be created in the terms of a series of interlocking routines, habituated action patterns that bring the same people together around the same activities in the same time and places [85, 87] . Prediction and preparation become difficult because of low probability and the complex nature of the tasks that must be carried to control the crisis [73] . Most large scale disasters are the result of separate, small events that become linked in unpredictable ways. The more tightly activities are coupled the less linear they become [58, 68] . During the preparation phase (which in fact can be considered a 'phase' only after the crisis happens), most tasks are loosely formulated and ill-defined. They are directed to possibly conflicting ends, while missing unequivocal criteria for deciding when and how objectives are to be achieved. Turner [73] argues that in those situations problems are often solved by creating 'small areas of certainty' which can be handled. Another frequently used solution is to simplify the assumption of the complex environment, thus allowing for an oversimplified set of actions. This could lead to a situation in which crisis managers assume they control the crisis while they are in fact fighting only a small part of it. In fact, through inadequate sensemaking of the environment [84] they may even contribute the crisis spinning out of control.",

In the process of instantiation, organizations and networks undergo a 'phase transition' [43] : from a defined state into another state in response to changing levels of urgency awareness. By instantiation we mean an organized, concerted effort to configure (information) resources into a means-end relationship within a short time span. Without these configuring effortsfor which network actors rely on the enactment of their cognitive frameworks [5] means-ends relationships at the network level hardly exist, they remain diverse, and they have therefore no value-generating strength. During the phase transition, the existing, rather loosely and sometimes non-or decoupled network should be instantaneously transformed 1 into a more or less tight coupled, hierarchical structure. Globally distributed information must be centralized and integrated into a central information and conversation space [24] .

Following Monge and Contractor [53] , we argue that the dynamics of networks should be analyzed from a multi-theoretical and multi-level perspective. A multi-theoretical perspective is needed to understand and explore network dynamics across levels. Elements from resource dependence theory, collective action theory and loosely coupled system theory are used here to build our framework for analyzing GCN.

Child and McGrath [17] argue that networks are value creating systems of several organizations possessing complementary strengths and resources that are often coordinated by a leading member.

The activating organization here is the network coordinator who collects resources and transforms the non-or loosely coupled ties between network actors into tightly coupling relationships for a particular period of time. 2 Network coordination is complex because of the heterogeneity of the network actors' interests, routines and technologies in use. Network actors are involved in causing, communication, and mitigating the effects of crises [68] . Crisis network response exceeds the formally structured arrangements of coordination. Instantiation of a GCN aims at achieving a collective goal that cannot be attained by the network actors individually. Hence, network instantiation can be conceived as collective action. This perspective proposes situations in and conditions under which cooperation appears beneficial to actors [16, 56] . Mediated by the network coordinator, GCN as a form of collective action gravitates towards the sharing of information between the networks actors on all sides, and the forming and calibrating of means-ends relationships [5, 25] .",

In a situation of resource dependency, sharing information of one organization's activities and resources enables other organizations to understand opportunities for coherently interrelating means-ends structures in and generating value [29, 59, 71] . Not sharing information may result in cooperation dilemmas [15, 45, 56] which occur when behavior that seems reason-able (rational) at the individual level leads to a situation in which everyone is worse off than they might have been otherwise [45] . A particular organization or government may have good reasons for not contributing to or participating in a GCN at its individual level. Yet the consequences may turn out to be dramatic at the collective level.",

A heterarchy, originally a notion from neurophysics, is defined as a network form of organization where authority is determined by knowledge and function rather than structure [49] . Applied to the study of organizational networks, this implies that GCNs are partially included and semi-autonomous. They are partially determined from below (the organizations), and partially determined from above (the network coordinator) due to the fact that GCNs involve multiple points of access, multiple linkages, and multiple determinations [46, 53] .

Differences in the level of preparedness at these levels might impede or obstruct GCN instantiation and consequently may cause or fail to avoid the occurrence of a collective disaster. A central element in GCNs is connectivity [24, 38] . Considering the multi-level nature of GCNs, connection refers to vertical (between levels, usually the network orchestrator versus network actors), and lateral connections (between network participants). As Fulk et al. [28] point out, connectivity has two components. The first is the physical component which can be understood as the technological infrastructure, including people's access (e.g. Internet connection, radio, TV, mobile phones). The second is social connectivity, which refers to the trustbased relationships between the levels of the network and between network participants [28] .",

This meaning emerges as the crisis becomes worse and interaction between the actors involved increases [74, 82] . Orton and Weick [58] distinguish two defining characteristic dimensions of organizational systems: responsiveness and distinctiveness of system elements. If there is neither responsiveness nor distinctiveness there is not really a system, and it can be defined as a non-coupled system. If there is responsiveness without distinctiveness of the elements, the system is tightly coupled. When there is distinctiveness without responsiveness, the system is decoupled.

It represents a unique type of a GCN because of its global impact, its success to contain the spread of the corona virus, and the use of the Internet to inform the public and to facilitate worldwide cooperation between experts. Moreover, the SARS outbreak caused a 'breakdown' of the existing international and national systems and procedures for responding to epidemic diseases. From a methodological point of view, breakdowns are interesting episodes to investigate as they reveal the current nature of practices, tools and equipment, customs [90] . The instantiation of the GCN to fight the SARS virus should be understood against the background of existing response and alert systems and procedures.

The fragmented structure of the national health care system appeared to be a main explanation for this failure at the operational level. The state of emergency (Code Orange) was declared in Canada in March 2003. This threatened the Canadian health care system. Code Orange is part of the Uniform Emergency Codes, which has been adopted by the Ontario Hospital Association in 1993. It indicates an external disaster, which alerts hospitals to prepare for a rapid influx of patients being brought to hospital by ambulances. The code is intended to be applied to a specific area and to be used for a limited period of time. However, it soon appeared that the Code Orange was not the appropriate response for an infectious disease outbreak such as SARS. The code paralyzed the health care system because there was in fact no extraordinary number of incoming patients, as would be the case during natural disasters. In fact, the challenge in controlling SARS was to significantly restrict access to healthcare facilities. Moreover, Code",

The SMS message was in the end caught up by people from the WHO global influenza surveillance network. A son of a retired WHO staff member, traveling through China, sent an email to the Communicable Disease Team Leader of the WHO in China in which he reported about \"the strange contagious disease which has already left more than 100 people dead in\u2026 Guangdong province, in the space of 1 week\" (quoted in [6: 75] ). From then on the WHO started to put the Chinese government under pressure to open up and exchange information about SARS. In April 2003, the Chinese press was allowed to publish on the SARS and only then a WHO team was allowed to visit the province of Guangdong. Thereafter, the Chinese government declared the war on SARS. In spite of the lack of modern information and communication technology the government initiated a very effective campaign on fighting SARS and mobilizing the entire population. It used community structures and people's surveillance to contain the spread of SARS. On a press conference on June 24 China was declared SARS-free [6] .",

The old IHR dated from 1969, and relied on a passive, statecentric system for the reporting of three communicable diseases that could spread globally: cholera, plague and yellow fever [39] . This passive system reflected the dominance of the exclusive privilege of countries to report and respond to infectious diseases within their own territories [40] . The idea of national sovereignty of national health care systems prevented the development of a strong commitment to the IHR. WHO member states frequently violated the IHR obligations to report outbreaks of diseases, because they feared serious economic consequences as other countries reacted to the outbreaks [27] .

This new system was formally launched in 2000 and embodied in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), a network with a secretariat within the WHO that links more than 120 individual surveillance and response networks (governmental and non-governmental) across the world. GOARN is an information-centric network, supported by advanced Internet technologies [57] . This system tracks outbreaks and spreading of SARS continually. GOARN consists of experts in various areas whose knowledge must be integrated to combat major diseases. Teams on the ground in relevant countries receive information from, and provide information to WHO. These teams work together through video-and teleconferencing. In cooperation with other agencies, WHO thus orchestrates a global network for monitoring disease outbreaks and communicating about these, mainly through its website. 3 vAn essential element within the GOARN is the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN).

The potential of a global infectious disease crisis revealed the need for a global response system. The SARS case showed that the 'phase transition' was driven by urgency awareness (here, the global threat of SARS). In this 'phase transition,' the WHO transformed from a traditionally slow acting, bureaucratic global organization [1] into a versatile network coordinator that was able to swiftly connect and mobilize globally distributed information sources.",

The intelligent, Internet-based information and communication systems of GOARN provided up to date information, not only for scientists, public health officers, and policy makers, but also directly for citizens.

They formed a loosely coupled system in itself, being loosely connected to the SARS GCN. They responded very quickly and cooperatively while at the same time they were able to preserve their distinctiveness and competitive orientation. The labs agreed that they would exchange research data, and figure out by themselves the most efficient way to divide up the work. The very fact that the labs were working independently appeared also to be a particular strength in their search for identifying the SARS virus. This situation closely resembles the functioning of academic networks as described by Orton and Weick [58] . Loose coupled systems, like the academic networks, exhibit properties of both decoupled and tightly coupled systems [12] . The emphasis on knowledge specialization contributes to the distinctiveness of the research labs, while this specialized knowledge is only useful when it can be integrated into common knowledge base of the academic network. From a knowledge creation perspective the SARS case provides an extreme case of dynamic knowledge specialization and integration. Within only a few months new knowledge was created, shared, integrated and applied. While current studies explore processes of work division and knowledge integration in distributed teams (e.g. [33, 44, 59] ), our study reconsiders these ideas for temporary networks.",

The WHO gained legitimacy in this heterarchically structured network not by enforcing relationships, but by successfully coordinating the global response within the context of an emerging shared sense of urgency. Spurred on by what seems resolute leadership of director-general Gro Harlem Brundland, the WHO decided to pursue an open information strategy, rather independently from the continuously conflicting national governments. It invited scientists, public healthcare workers, policy makers, travelers, and citizens to collaboratively help to control and contain the spreading of SARS. In contrasts with the closed information strategy of the Chinese government during the first three months of the SARS outbreak, this open information strategy helped to leverage untapped resources and allowed people to take responsibility. The initially weak social connections between China and the global network prevented a timely alert and response.",

Irrespective of China's ability, the case study showed the unwillingness to cooperate in the GCN for SARS during the first few months of the crisis. This political aspect in crisis management is hardly addressed yet in the organizational literature on organizational crises, except for policy evaluation reports on for instance the Katrina disaster [19] . It underscores the role of culture and trust in crises response. Fidler (2004) argues that the SARS outbreak reflected the collapse of the classical regime on infectious disease control, which was dominated by the sovereignty of national health care systems. The SARS outbreak instantiated a new kind of global solidarity in the detection and validation of global infectious diseases [40] .

The sharing of information and delegation of tasks without continuous surveillance to unknown partners turned out to be problematic. Trust relationships are not built overnight and require prior investments [8] . Moingeon and Edmondson [52] distinguish two levels of trust. The first refers to the confidence that other organizations will not abuse the information that will be exchanged. The second refers to the belief that other organizations are capable to keep up with their promises [52] . While both types of trust are important, trust in intent probes to be problematic as time shortage does not allow for establishing enduring trustworthy relationships. Hagel and Brown [38] therefore argue that when organizations operate in dynamic environments trust relationships should be mainly based on trust in competence. Jarvenpaa and Leidner [42] found that high-trust virtual teams exhibit a form of 'swift trust'. People who have never worked together and do not expect to work again act as if trust is present from the start. Meyerson et al. [50] characterize swift trust as a form of depersonalized action which may be a by-product of a highly proactive, enthusiastic generative style of action. Although we should be cautious in generalizing conclusions from research on virtual teams to global crisis response, it might help to explain how swift trust emerges in GCNs. Our study, though, emphasizes additional factors at play such as or organizational preparedness and openness. With an increasing sense of urgency in crisis situations, decision makers will calculate the risk of non-trusting and embrace a collaborative attitude.",

As global cooperation between organizations will increase, it is important to understand the coordination dynamics of global loosely coupled networks. Our multi-level and multi-theoretical framework is an attempt to analyze and explain these dynamics. We think it is important to search for, synthesize and extend management and organizational conceptssuch as Global Crisis Network, collective action, loosely coupled systems and network coordination, and leverage capability buildingto understand new dynamics of globally operating agile networks responding to global events.",
