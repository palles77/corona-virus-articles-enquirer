This can occur if they have not completed their primary immunization series, rendering them susceptible to vaccine preventable illnesses 5 or if they have not had exposure to common community pathogens. Accordingly, young children, compared with adult transplant recipients, are at higher risk of acquiring primary infection with many organisms after they are immunosuppressed, which can lead to increased severity. 6, 7 The underlying disease processes and complications of end stage organ disease represent additional risks for infectious complications. The risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) after renal transplantation is increased in children who have underlying vesicoureteral reflux. 8 Candidates for lung transplantation with cystic fibrosis (CF) are often colonized with fungi and highly resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Likewise prolonged hospitalization times before transplantation increase the risk of nosocomial colonization with resistant organisms. Disorders requiring palliative surgery can also lead to technical difficulties during subsequent transplantation increasing the risk of infection. 9 Finally, children who were previously immunosuppressed from iatrogenic medications or chronic malnutrition are at enhanced risk of infection after transplantation. 10, 11 The type of allograft and the technical factors unique to each organ transplant procedure are important determinants of both location and type of postoperative infections. For example, the risk of infection after liver transplantation has been associated with the type of biliary reconstruction used. 12 Thrombosis of the hepatic artery has been shown to predispose to hepatic abscess and bacteremia following liver transplant. In thoracic transplant recipients, mediastinal bleeding requiring subsequent re-exploration increases the risk of mediastinitis and sepsis. 13 Prolonged operative time has been associated with increased risk of infection and is likely a surrogate marker for the technical difficulty of the surgery. 14 In addition, ischemic injury can reduce the viability of the allograft and increase the risk of infection.",

Primary CMV infection acquired from the donor allograft (ie, CMV donor-positive/recipient-negative) has been associated with the highest morbidity and mortality. 7 Acquisition of CMV from blood products has significantly decreased since the era of screening blood and the institution of leukoreduction of packed red blood cells in many centers. Reactivation of endogenous CMV or superinfection with a new CMV strain are generally associated with lesser incidence and severity of disease due to the presence of CMVspecific humoral and cell-mediated immunity in the recipient. Antithymocyte globulin and CD3 monoclonal antibody increase the risk of CMV disease. 21 CMV causes a wide range of clinical manifestations that vary according to the type of allograft and the nature and duration of immunosuppression. Definitions of CMV infection and disease have been developed for the purpose of consistent reporting of CMV in clinical trials. 16 CMV infection is defined as having CMV replication in any body fluid or tissue specimen. CMV disease refers to the evidence of infection in the presence of attributable symptoms and typically presents 30 to 90 days after transplantation, but can be delayed in the setting of prophylaxis. 22 Disease caused by CMV can be further classified as CMV syndrome, a clinical condition with fever, malaise, leukopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia in the absence of end organ involvement and CMV tissue invasive disease presenting as pneumonitis, hepatitis, gastrointestinal disease, myocarditis, and less frequently as encephalitis or retinitis.

CMV serology is useful for the determination of the donor and recipient pretransplant serostatus and posttransplant risk, but is of limited value after transplantation. CMV can be cultured from a variety of specimens including urine, tissues, and respiratory secretions. However, traditional culture is slow and less sensitive than detection by newer molecular techniques. Although rapid shell vial culture techniques for CMV improve the timeliness of detection, neither culture method is able to distinguish between viral shedding and true CMV disease. The pp65 antigenemia assay detects the late structural protein pp65 produced in leukocytes with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 100%. 23, 24 The need for both rapid processing and technical skill in interpretation limit its usefulness. Molecular diagnostic assays that detect and quantify CMV-DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have high sensitivity (95-100%) and are being increasingly recognized as the method of choice for diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring in CMV disease. Comparative studies between antigenemia detection and PCR have shown a more than 80% concordance. 23, 25 Both PCR and pp65 antigenemia can be used for early detection of viral replication according to local experience.",

Specific prevention strategies vary widely among centers with the two approaches most commonly used being universal prophylaxis of all patients at risk for CMV and preemptive therapy. Each strategy has advantages and disadvantages. Unfortunately, data from multicenter controlled randomized trials evaluating different prevention strategies in pediatric transplant recipients are lacking. 26 Intravenous ganciclovir, a nucleoside analog, is the therapy of choice for established CMV disease. Myelotoxicity is the most limiting side effect. Foscarnet, a competitive inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase, and cidofovir, a nucleotide analog with broad antiviral activity, are therapeutic alternatives in cases of ganciclovir resistance, but both agents have significant nephrotoxicity. Oral agents, such as oral ganciclovir and most recently the ganciclovir prodrug valganciclovir, have been used most often for prophylaxis or preemptive therapy. Appropriate dosing for valganciclovir in children is still not known but should benefit from an ongoing multi-center, international study of the pharmacology of a liquid formulation in pediatric transplant recipients. The benefit of adding CMV hyperimmune globulin in treating CMV disease remains uncertain. 27 Judicious reduction of immunosuppression is an important component in the treatment of CMV disease. Despite successful treatment, CMV infection recurs in one-third of solid organ recipients. The incidence of resistance in SOT patients receiving prophylaxis is estimated at 0% to 13%.",

In the normal host, the proliferation of immortalized B cells is limited by a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. In transplant recipients, however, immunosuppressive therapy impairs this response, creating the potential for uncontrolled lymphoproliferation. 28 This is particularly true for recipients who undergo primary infection after transplantation. EBV infection has been associated with a wide spectrum of disease in pediatric transplant patients, including asymptomatic seroconversion, nonspecific viral illness, mononucleosis, PTLD, and lymphoma. The term EBV-associated PTLD is generally used to describe a heterogeneous group of clinical syndromes associated with EBV driven lymphoproliferation ranging from a benign self-limited form of polyclonal proliferation to true malignancies containing clonal chromosomal abnormalities. 29 The disease may be nodal or extranodal, localized or disseminated. PTLD has been identified as the most common post transplant malignancy in pediatric SOT patients. 30 Primary EBV infection, often donor-associated (EBV seropositive donor/seronegative recipient), is the most clearly defined risk factor for the development of early PTLD (\u03fd12 months after transplant). 6 Children are therefore at considerably higher risk of developing PTLD than adults as they are often EBV na\u00efve at the time of transplantation. The incidence of PTLD is also dependent on the type of organ transplanted, with small intestinal transplant recipients being at highest risk (up to 32%), pancreas, heart, lung, and liver transplant recipients are at moderate risk (3-12%), and recipients of kidney transplants are at relatively low risk. 6 A high index of suspicion and clinical vigilance must be maintained to allow for timely evaluation for EBV disease or PTLD. An increasing body of evidence supports the measurement of quantitative EBV viral load using PCR in peripheral blood as an adjunct for early diagnosis of EBV/ PTLD, particularly in those at highest risk. 31, 32 Ongoing research will assist with developing recommendations for an optimal monitoring protocol.",

Most cases occur between 1 and 6 months after transplantation, but it is infrequent with the widespread use of prophylaxis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is considered the prophylactic agent of choice. Alternative agents available include pentamidine, dapsone, atovaquone, and combination therapy with clindamycin and pyrimethamine. Notably, breakthrough PCP infections in patients receiving alternative prophylactic regimens have been reported and are often atypical. 60 Toxoplasma gondii is also an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised individuals. Toxoplasmosis after SOT may result from primary infection or from reactivation of latent infection with the greatest risk for acquisition of T. gondii infection occurring in seronegative heart transplant recipients from a seropositive donor. Although post transplant toxoplasmosis has been most frequently found after cardiac transplantation, it has also has been reported to occur in recipients of other organs. [61] [62] [63] Clinical symptoms usually develop within the intermediate posttransplant period. 63, 64 Fever may be the only clinical manifestation. Dis-semination of the parasite to the CNS may lead to signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis. A sepsis-like picture, pneumonia, or cutaneous lesions are unusual manifestations. Prophylactic administration of pyrimethamine to seronegative recipients of hearts from seropositive donors has prevented disease. Alternatively, prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole appears to be protective in adult cardiac transplant recipients. 65 Although uncommon, infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) after transplantation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The frequency of posttransplant MTB is 1.2% to 6.4% in most developed countries, but it may reach 15% among SOT recipients living in endemic areas. Most commonly, MTB results from reactivation of latent infection with disease onset during the intermediate period. 66, 67 Compared with normal hosts, clinical presentation after SOT has a higher incidence of disseminated disease and extrapulmonary involvement. Manifestations include fever of unknown origin and allograft dysfunction. Coinfection with other pathogens is not uncommon. Treatment of MTB after SOT poses special challenges because of potential interactions between anti-MTB drugs and immunosuppressive medications and potential hepatotoxicity. Prophylaxis with isoniazid is indicated in patients with evidence of latent MTB infection. 68 Most experts recommend screening candidates and administering prophylaxis to those that are positive before undergoing transplantation.",
