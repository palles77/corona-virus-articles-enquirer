In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) 4 to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not 5 feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for 6 cardiorespiratory risk. 7 METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with 8 pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise.",

Neither age nor baseline SpO2 17 predicted anaerobic threshold, or lower/higher risk categories, either alone or in multivariate analyses, 18 despite baseline oxygen saturation (SpO2) ranging from 79 to 99 (median 92)%, haemoglobin from 108 19 to 183 (median 156)g.L -1 . However, lower haemoglobin, and particularly, arterial oxygen content and 20 oxygen pulse, were associated with increased cardiorespiratory risk: Modelling a haemoglobin increase 21 of 25g.L -1 placed a further 7/26 (26.9%) patients in a lower risk category.
