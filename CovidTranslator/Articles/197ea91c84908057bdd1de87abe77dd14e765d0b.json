A total of 300 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from infants suffering from bronchiolitis since October 2000 to June 2003 and shown previously as negative to common respiratory viruses were examined. Matrix and polymerase viral genes, which show a low rate of variation, were chosen to design amplification assays to ensure that any genotype of the human metapneumovirus could be detected. A RT-PCR followed by a reverse line blotting hybridisation was developed for viral polymerase gene. For the matrix gene, after the RT-PCR assay, a subsequent nested PCR was carried out. Both assays had similar sensitivity, equivalent to 0.1 TCID 50 of human metapneumovirus strain NL/1/99 which was used as the positive control. The human metapneumovirus was present in 16.6% of the specimens studied. The approaches described below are not only a robust method for rapid diagnosis of the human metapneumovirus, but also to establish an etiological surveillance tool for epidemiological studies. Based on the results obtained, human metapneumovirus infections in Madrid followed a seasonal pattern, with most of the infections occurring between February and April.",

In order to identify genetic variants of the main human metapneumovirus lineages, the design of amplification assays was focused on fragments of two different genes highly conserved. The use of two alternative RT-PCR assays presents the advantage of confirming the positive results in two independent genes and it also guarantees a decrease in the number of false positive results. The RT-heminested-PCR for the matrix gene is easy to perform and do not need high technology requirements. The reverse line blotting protocol for the viral polymerase gene is a safe procedure since nonradioactive reactives are used for labelling the probe and has the advantage of being suitable for large-scale epidemiological screening. The usage of the probe increases the specificity of the assay. In our experience, both methods were reliable and reproducible. Contamination with amplified products is prevented by careful separation of each mixture preparation, extraction, addition of the sample RNA, amplification and postamplification areas. Different sets of laboratory coats, pipettes and filtered pipette tips are used in each different area.",

            "text": "The assays were validated by examinining 300 nasopharyngeal aspirates from a complete cohort of 747 collected from infant population, less than 2 years old, suffering from acute respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis, pneumonia and influenza like illnesses, attending the Paediatric Unit of the Hospital Severo Ochoa in Madrid (Spain). Nasopharyngeal aspirate was a suitable type of specimen for the specific diagnosis of infections due to respiratory viruses. The specimens were collected from 2000 to 2003, not only during the respiratory virus circulation season but also during the rest of the year. The results provide further evidence that human metapneumovirus accounts for many cases of acute respiratory infection in children of this age, as 16.6% positives were detected in the 300 nasopharyngeal aspirates studied. The analysis of these results suggests that paediatric respiratory disease due to human metapneumovirus may have been underestimated due to the lack of rapid, sensitive and reliable diagnostic methods in most paediatric units. Most of the incidence studies associated with human metapneumovirus reported a lower rate of infection, which corresponded to values between 5 and 10% (Esper et al., 2004; Ijpma et al., 2004; Mackay et al., 2003; van den Hoogen et al., 2003) . The percentage obtained in our study would be similar to that reported by Maggi et al. (2003) in Italy and by Viazov et al. (2003) in Germany, who also studied specimens from infants less than 2 years old. Other researchers, who evaluated children older than ours Esper et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003b; Vicente et al., 2003) or a wider age group ranging from children to adults (Stockton et al., 2002) found a lower incidence of human metapneumovirus. Therefore, our results support the views that human metapneumovirus is, after respiratory syncytial virus, an important cause of viral acute respiratory infections in children under 5 years.",

Human metapneumovirus positive specimens were collected mainly during the late winter and early spring months. Some positive cases were detected during the rest of the year. In contrast to other studies, no alternative years of high and low incidence were observed (Maggi et al., 2003) . The peak of virus detection was found between February and April on the 3 years period from 2000 to 2003. Besides, the onset of respiratory syncytial virus disease was determined between December and January, just before the peak of human metapneumovirus detection, during the same seasons (data not shown). These results confirm that human metapneumovirus circulates primarily during the late winter and early spring, at the end of the circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (Falsey et al., 2003; Maggi et al., 2003; von Linstow et al., 2004) . However, positive specimens for human metapneumovirus were also found during the late spring and summer months. Peiris et al. (2003b) reported human metapneumovirus activity in these months too. Nevertheless, few data related to summer months are available, since most of the studies only examined samples collected during winter season. In relation to the age of the children studied, most of the human metapneumovirus infections affected children between 6 and 12 months of age (data not shown), in agreement with previous data (van den Hoogen et al., 2003) . Further studies will be needed to determine the real incidence of human metapneumovirus in communityacquired acute respiratory infections in young children in Spain.",

Diagnosis of human metapneumovirus is essential to reduce the number of respiratory infections in which the etiologic agent is not recognized. It should be noted that human metapneumovirus was detected in 16.6% of the subgroup with negative results out of the total 747 nasopharyngeal aspirates, the use of these specific molecular assays have increased at least in 6.7% the number of specimens in which a viral agent could have been determined.
