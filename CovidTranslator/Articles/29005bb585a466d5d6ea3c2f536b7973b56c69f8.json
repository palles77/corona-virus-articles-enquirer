Post-translational modifications have been speculated to be involved but have not been shown to account for the difference in molecular weight, The proteins recognized by the ORFI fusion protein antiserum were present in a 100000g pellet of sonicated trophozoites and therefore are likely to be associated with membranes or vesicles.",

The nonuniform distribution of hydrophobic amino acids of hgll and hgl2 suggests the existence of five structural domains (Fig. I b, I c) : (I) At the amino terminus of the mature protein is a 187amino acid cysteine (3.2mol %)and tryptoDhan (2.1 mole %)-rich amino-terminus domain; (2) The second cysteine-free domain, corresponding to hgll residues 188-378, contains alternoting hydrophobic and hydrophilic stretches of amino acids and ~s the most variable between the two proteins. A substantial nonconservative change is the addition of eight amino acids at amino acid285 in hgll; (3) The third structural domain is the cysteine-rich domain, which contains 10.8 mol % of cysteine. The number and position of the cyste~ne residues have been conserved with the exception of amino acidS04, which is a serine residue in hgl2. It has been shown that the cysteine residues play an important role in the observed protease resistance of the 170 kDa subunit and may be important for parasite survival in the gut28; (4) A putative transmembrane domain contains only two conservative changes between hgll and hgl2 and (5) The carboxy-terminal domain is a putative cytoplasmic tail that is also highly conserved. There are a total of II threonine, serine and tyrosine residues that are potential sites for phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic domain of hgl2 and only nine such residues in hgll. Tyrosine residue 1261, present in both hgll and hgl2, ~s surrounded by an amino acid sequence that shares ~dentity with the autophosphorylat~on site of the epidermal growth factor receptor 28. It is interesting to speculate that phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain may be a mechanqsm of activation of the lectin, and that the degree of phosphorylation could functionally distinguish the different forms of the 1 70 kDa subunit. The h~gh degree of conservation of the cytoplasmic domain also suggests that the lectin may interact with a cytoplasmic protein in another route of signal transduction.",

The contributions of the light subuntt to the functional activities of the galactose lectin remain unresolved as do the biological functions of many of the other surface antigens identtfied to date.
