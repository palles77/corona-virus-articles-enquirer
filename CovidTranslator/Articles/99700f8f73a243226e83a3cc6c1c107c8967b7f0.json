Although cellular receptors for coxsackievirus B in EV-B have been identified, receptors mediating virus entry, especially the uncoating process of echovirus and other EV-B remain obscure. Here, we found that human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the uncoating receptor for major EV-B. FcRn binds to the virus particles in the ''canyon'' through its FCGRT subunit. By obtaining multiple cryo-electron microscopy structures at different stages of virus entry at atomic or near-atomic resolution, we deciphered the underlying mechanisms of enterovirus attachment and uncoating. These structures revealed that different from the attachment receptor CD55, binding of FcRn to the virions induces efficient release of ''pocket factor'' under acidic conditions and initiates the conformational changes in viral particle, providing",

EV-B infections cause viral encephalitis (VE), viral meningitis (VM), and viral meningo-encephalitis (VME), leading to substantial morbidity and mortality in children (Holmes et al., 2016; Khetsuriani et al., 2006) . They are also the causative agents of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), nonspecific rashes, pneumonitis, hepatitis, coagulopathy, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) (Abzug, 2014; Huang et al., 2015) . In recent years, severe outbreaks of echovirus infections have been documented in America, Europe, and Asia (Croker et al., 2015; Kadambari et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2012; Mao et al., 2010) . In particular, echoviruses and CV-A9 accounted for seven out of the top 15 most frequently occurring enterovirus serotypes from [2014] [2015] [2016] in the United States (Abedi et al., 2018) . In China, surveillance of children with VE and VM in several provinces revealed that EV-B, (legend continued on next page) especially echovirus, is the dominant serotype in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients (Chen et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2016) . It remains obscure how EV-B viruses cross the blood-brain barrier to cause these neurological diseases. Thus, discovery of their potential receptor(s) and entry mechanism will provide insight into the underling mechanisms of EV-B crossing the blood-brain barrier.",

            "text": "According to our current understanding, there are two types of receptors, attachment and uncoating receptors, that are involved in non-enveloped virus entry and genome release . However, their differential roles remain undetermined. To date, several host receptors have been identified to facilitate the entry of enteroviruses, including CD155 (PVR) for poliovirus, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) for CV-A21 and CV-A24, scavenger receptor B2 (SCARB2) and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) for EV-A71, and KREMEN1 for some of the group A enteroviruses (Abzug, 2014; Baggen et al., 2018; Mendelsohn et al., 1989; Nishimura et al., 2009; Staring et al., 2018; Tuthill et al., 2010; Xiao et al., 2001; Yamayoshi et al., 2009) . For EV-B, CD55 has previously been reported as the receptor for CV-B1, -B3, -B5 and several other echovirus serotypes. Moreover, a 2 b 1 integrin is the receptor for Echo 1, while a V b 6 and a V b 3 integrins facilitate CV-A9 entry (Bergelson et al., 1993 (Bergelson et al., , 1994 He et al., 2002; Ward et al., 1994; Williams et al., 2004) . Among the above EV-B receptors, CD55, a 2 b 1 , a V b 6 , and a V b 3 are responsible for virus attachment, but none of them induce conformational changes in the viral particle, a process required for virus uncoating and genome release (Shakeel et al., 2013; Tuthill et al., 2010) . Although coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) serves as the uncoating receptor for CV-B (Bergelson et al., 1997) , the uncoating receptors for other EV-B viruses are yet unknown.",

            "text": "Capsid uncoating and genome release are critical steps to fulfill the life cycle of non-enveloped virus after its attachment . Interestingly, most of the identified uncoating receptors for picornavirus (e.g., PVR, CAR, and ICAM-1) are Ig-like proteins (Bergelson et al., 1997; He et al., 2000; Rossmann et al., 2002) , with the exception of SCARB2 (Wang et al., 2012) . Most of the uncoating receptors bind to the ''canyon'' sites (deep depressions surrounding the fivefold axis) of the viral particle . This binding triggers the release of ''pocket factor,'' which is hypothesized to be a lipid accommodated within a pocket below the canyon to stabilize the virion structure, and subsequently induces conformational changes in the viral particle (Bergelson and Coyne, 2013; Rossmann et al., 2002) . The general con-cepts for enterovirus entry have previously been established using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of several enteroviruses in complexes with their receptors at moderate resolutions, including poliovirus, CV-B3, CV-A21, and CV-A24 (Baggen et al., 2018; Bubeck et al., 2005; He et al., 2001; Organtini et al., 2014; Strauss et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2008) . However, structural information of enterovirus-receptor complexes at atomic resolution and the mechanism of ''pocket factor'' release are missing, which would provide a much more accurate and systematic insight into the process of enterovirus entry.",

As an immune factor, FcRn is hijacked by the virus as its uncoating receptor. FcRn-mediated uncoating was confirmed by FcRn-decorated liposome experiments. We also determined a series of high-resolution cryo-EM structures of Echo 6 virus in the apo form and in complex with either its attachment receptor CD55 or uncoating receptor FcRn, at both neutral and acidic pH conditions. By comparing these structures, we systematically dissected the differential roles of Echo 6 attachment and uncoating receptors. It is the uncoating receptor FcRn that triggers the ''pocket factor'' release at a low pH within the endosome.",

The sgRNA-coding regions were amplified from the extracted genomic DNA of library cells before and after Echo 6 infection, followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and data analysis using the MAGeCK method (Peng et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2017) (Tables S1 and S2 ). The top genes from the screen were: CD55, which has already been identified to encode the known Echo 6 receptor responsible for virus attachment (Bergelson et al., 1994; Ward et al., 1994) ; and FCGRT and B2M, encoding two subunits of FcRn, respectively ( Figures 1A and 1B) . FcRn is an MHC class I-like protein consisting of a heavy a chain encoded by the FCGRT gene, and a light b2-microglubulin (b2 m) chain encoded by the B2M gene. The a chain of FcRn contains three domains (a1, a2, and (B) Schematic diagram of sgRNA library construction and Echo 6 receptor screening.

Given that CAR is the uncoating receptor for all six serotypes of CV-B viruses (Martino et al., 2000) , we hypothesized that FcRn is also a universal uncoating receptor for other EV-B viruses. To test this hypothesis, we selected 11 echovirus serotypes in separate branches of the phylogenetic tree for further analysis: Echo 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 25, 26, and 30 . EV-B85 and CVA-9 were also included because they are physiologically close to echoviruses (Figures 2A and 2B) . For Echo 6 and 30, we tested both their epidemic and prototypic strains. FCGRT KO or B2M KO abolished the viral infection for EV-B85, CVA-9, and all of the above-mentioned echoviruses, suggesting that FcRn is a key host factor for these viruses ( Figure 2B ). In contrast, neither FCGRT KO nor B2M KO prevented CV-B4 or CV-B5 infections ( Figure 2C ). We thus propose that FcRn is the receptor candidate for the major group of EV-B viruses.",

Each viral particle contains 60 copies of VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4, which highly resembles the architecture of other enteroviruses . Similar to other enteroviruses, the Echo 6 virus contains both full and empty particles (lacking the ''pocket factor,'' VP4 subunit and genome inside) ( Figures 4H and 4I ). We found that only the full particles could bind the receptors, indicating that the empty particles are the relics of virus uncoating without infectivity. This is consistent with previous hypotheses based on EV71 studies (Wang et al., 2012) . Our biochemical studies and cell-based assays suggested that the role of FcRn in mediating Echo 6 entry is different from that of CD55, which enables virus attachment at the early stage of infection (Powell et al., 1997) . Based on these cryo-EM structures, binding of CD55 or FcRn at neutral pH did not induce evident conformational changes in the Echo 6 virions, in which the ''pocket factor'' is well accommodated ( Figures 4C-4F ). These observations indicated that both receptors can mediate virus attachment, and FcRn plays a role in inducing virus uncoating.",

The structure of CD55-bound Echo 6 virus at pH 5.5 was highly similar to that at pH 7.4. The ''pocket factor'' was still preserved, and the viral proteins did not exhibit significant structural rearrangements (Figures 4C and 4D) . In contrast, the acidic condition caused dramatic changes to FcRn-bound Echo 6 viral particles. In this structure, the bound FcRn molecules began to dissociate from the virions, resulting in significantly reduced receptor densities due to low occupancies ( Figure 4E ). In comparison to the apo form and the CD55-bound Echo 6 virions, the ''pocket factor'' in FcRn-bound viral particles at pH 5.5 was released, and the pocket began to collapse with slight conformational changes on some residues within the ''pocket'' region (Figures 4G and S6) . Furthermore, the structure of the FcRn-Echo 6 complex under acidic conditions was also different from that of the empty viral particles. The pocket was not fully collapsed, and the VP4 subunits and viral genome inside were still preserved, suggesting that the FcRn-Echo 6 structure is an intermediate in the process of virus uncoating ( Figure S6 ). This structural evidence demonstrates that FcRn mediates viral binding, ''pocket factor'' release, and capsid uncoating, whereas CD55 is solely responsible for the virus attachment.",

Among them, the binding site of CD55 on Echo 6 virus is highly similar to that on CV-B3 but different from those on Echo 7 and Echo 12 viruses (Figures S7A and S7B ). CD55 is rotated by $60 around the SCR3 domain on the Echo 7 and Echo 12 viruses and mainly binds to VP2 and VP3, leaving the ''canyon'' fully exposed ( Figure S7B ). As CD55 is not able to mediate uncoating of Echo 6 virus, it may dissociate from the virion before FcRn binding or bind to another icosahedral asymmetric unit as the canyon is shielded by CD55 to render steric hindrance for the access of FcRn ( Figure S7C ). For Echo 7 and Echo 12 viruses, however, the scenario is probably different as the two receptors could bind simultaneously within the same icosahedral asymmetric unit ( Figure S7D ).",

The same phenomenon was not observed in either free Echo 6 particles or the CD55-Echo 6 complex ( Figure 6A ). To further confirm that FcRn mediates virus capsid uncoating, a receptor-decorated liposome model was used as designed for a PVR-induced poliovirus uncoating study (Groppelli et al., 2017; Tuthill et al., 2006) . His-tagged FcRn or CD55 was incubated with nickel-charged liposomes to form receptor-decorated liposomes. Echo 6 particles attached to the surface of both FcRn-and CD55-decorated liposomes ( Figures 6D and  6E ) but not undecorated liposomes ( Figure 6F ). In addition, only the FcRn-decorated liposomes were able to induce structural transitions of Echo 6 particles ( Figure 6E) . A considerable proportion of empty particles were clearly observed after full Echo 6 particles were incubated with FcRn-decorated liposomes ( Figure 6E ). These data further demonstrate that FcRn is able to mediate EV-B uncoating under physiological conditions.",

            "text": "In this work, we identified FcRn as an uncoating receptor for echoviruses, CV-A9, and other physiologically closely related novel EV-B viruses. FcRn bound echovirus particles and induced conformational changes. FcRn-mediated Echo 6 capsid uncoating was confirmed with an FcRn-decorated liposome model, which mimics the physiological condition of FcRn-expressing endosomes. Our findings are consistent with previous reports that the binding of CD55 to echovirus does not induce conformational changes of the viral particles Plevka et al., 2010; Powell et al., 1997) . As FcRn is also present on the cell surface in addition to its expression on endosome membrane (Roopenian and Akilesh, 2007) , it is possible that CD55, as an initial attachment receptor, ''hands off'' the virus to FcRn on the cell membrane, which then mediates virus uncoating, just like CAR for CV-B entry (Whitton et al., 2005) . It has been speculated by several groups that echoviruses should have an Ig-like receptor to mediate uncoating (Plevka et al., 2010; Powell et al., 1997; Rossmann et al., 2002) . Moreover, b2 m has been found to play a crucial role for the infections of several echoviruses and CV-A9, but it is unclear how it works (Heikkil\u00e4 et al., 2010; Marjom\u00e4 ki et al., 2002; Ward et al., 1998) . Our findings verify that b2 m plays an essential role for echovirus uncoating as a subunit of the FcRn receptor.",

The two undefined receptor binding modes on the viral surface are labeled with question marks. ''pocket factor'' release in the enterovirus at acidic pH after binding to the viral uncoating receptor, in high-resolution cryo-EM structures. Together with the cryo-EM structures at other stages of virus entry, we describe a working model for enterovirus entry (Figure 7 ). Taking Echo 6 as an example, the virus binds to the attachment receptor CD55 on the cell surface, which triggers viral endocytosis and internalization. Viral particles are subsequently captured by the uncoating receptor FcRn within endosomes. The low pH environment of the endosomes prompts the extrusion of ''pocket factor'' after FcRn binding, resulting in virus uncoating and genome release. Alternatively, viral particles could also be captured by FcRn at the cell membrane, as FcRn bound at both neutral and acidic pH, and further induces endocytosis and uncoating in the endosome (Figure 7) .",

There is substantial expression of FcRn in the gut, kidneys, lungs, placenta, hematopoietic cells, vascular endothelium, and at the blood-brain barrier (Roopenian and Akilesh, 2007; Schlachetzki et al., 2002) . This is in accordance with the tissue tropism of EV-B, as the gut is the major target for EV-B, where the viruses transmit to many other organs such as the CNS, liver, spleen, lungs, bone marrow, and heart to cause several types of diseases (Choudhary, 2017) .

Most echoviruses and other physiologically closely related viruses in the EV-B group have no animal model, except for Echo 1 whose mouse model expresses human VLA-2 (Dalldorf et al., 1955; Hughes et al., 2003) . Lack of animal models greatly hinders studying the pathogenesis of EV-B as it relates to VE and VM, as well as the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines. Ectopic expression of CD55 is insufficient to make rodent cells susceptible to echovirus infection (Renois et al., 2011) .

After initial fitting, the model was manually adjusted in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010) to improve map fitting and update the sequence registers. The density map of an asymmetric unit (ASU) was then segmented using Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and placed into a pseudo crystallographic unit cell (P1 space group) for model refinement. The atomic model was refined against the ASU map in real space using Phenix with secondary structure restraints applied. Model statistics (including bond lengths, bond angles, and all-atom clash), rotamer statistics, and Ramachandran plot statistics were monitored during the refinement procedure. After several rounds of iterative model building and refinement, the model coordinates converged and fit well in the density map by visual inspection. At this point, the individual B factors and occupancies of each atom were refined using the standard reciprocal space refinement procedure in Phenix (Adams et al., 2010) The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed using MolProbity . The Echo 6-CD55/FcRn complexes were modeled with the free-Echo6 structure as the initial model following a similar procedure as described above. All data collection, processing, model building and refinement statistics are summarized in Table S3 .",

In all of these structures, most regions reach 3.0 \u00c5 and allowed the atomic details to be resolved. (C-K) Representative density maps and atomic models of the pocket region or receptor binding interface. Most side chains of key residues within the pocket are clearly resolved. The ''pocket factor'' is preserved in structures of free Echo 6 full-particle or in complex with CD55 at both pH 7.4 and pH 5.5. In the structures with FcRn binding, it is well accommodated at pH 7.4, but is released at pH 5.5. Conformational difference of the protein surrounding the ''pocket'' region of Echo 6 full-particle with empty-particle at pH 7.4. The backbone of Echo 6 full particle is shown in gray, and empty particle is shown in pink. The remarkable residues involved in conformational changes are shown as sticks and colored by elements. The pocket in the empty-particle is obviously collapsed as compared to that in the full viral particle.(C) Backbone traces of atomic models showing the conformation of the ''pocket.'' Backbone of Echo 6 particle in the Echo 6-FcRn complex at pH 7.4 is shown in green. The pocket is highly similar to that in the full viral particle and allows the accommodation of the ''pocket factor.'' (D) The conformational difference of the Echo 6-FcRn complex at pH 7.4 and pH 5.5. Backbones of the Echo 6 particle in the Echo 6-FcRn complex at pH 7.4 and pH 5.5 are shown in green and cyan, respectively. The ''pocket'' in the Echo 6-FcRn complex at pH 5.5 began to shrink compared to that at pH 7.4, but is not fully collapsed as observed in the empty particle. The remarkable residues involved in the conformational change are shown as sticks and colored by elements. Figure S7 . Comprehensive Comparison of CD55 and FcRn Binding Sites on Different Enteroviruses, Related to Figure 5 (A) Cartoon diagrams of CD55 bound to different enteroviruses determined by cryo-EM. Each component is represented with a unique color, and CD55 is colored in gold.(B) Superimposition of the atomic models of CD55 bound to different enteroviruses within an asymmetric unit. The icosahedral axes are shown as triangles and pentangles. The binding site of CD55 on Echo 6 virus is similar to that on CV-B3, but different from those on the Echo 7 and Echo 12 viruses. The ''canyon'' is indicated by a red asterisk.(C) Comparison of the binding sites of CD55 and FcRn on Echo 6 virus. The viral proteins are shown in surface models, and the receptors are shown as ribbons. The position of the ''canyon'' is indicated by a red asterisk. The steric clash between CD55 and FcRn is highlighted by a dashed oval.(D) Comparison of the binding sites of CD55 and FcRn on Echo 7 virus. The two receptors could bind simultaneously on the virus without clashing. Two different views of the superimposition are shown to reveal the compatibility of the two receptors in space. VP1, VP2 and VP3 of the virus are shown in green, cyan and magenta, respectively. CD55 molecules bound to Echo 6, Echo 7, Echo 12 and CV-B3 are shown in blue, black, pink and red, respectively. The FCGRT subunit of FcRn is shown in orange, and b2 m is in gray.",
