Nevertheless, in practice, most complex networks might be interconnected with each other (due to the existence of common components) and exhibit layered properties while the connections on different layers represent various relationships. These types of networks are characterized as multiplex networks. A two-layered multiplex network model (usually composed of a virtual layer sustaining unaware-awareunaware (UAU) dynamics and a physical one supporting susceptible-infected-recovereddead (SIRD) process) is presented to investigate the spreading property of fatal epidemics in this manuscript. Due to the incorporation of the virtual layer, the recovered and dead individuals seem to play different roles in affecting the epidemic spreading process. In details, the corresponding nodes on the virtual layer for the recovered individuals are capable of transmitting information to other individuals, while the corresponding nodes for the dead individuals (which are to be eliminated) on the virtual layer should be removed as well. With the coupled UAU-SIRD model, the relationships between the focused variables and parameters of the epidemic are studied thoroughly. As indicated by the results, the range of affected individuals will be reduced by a large amount with the incorporation of virtual layers. Furthermore, the effects of recovery time on the epidemic spreading process are also investigated aiming to consider various physical conditions. Theoretical analyses are also derived for scenarios with and without required time periods for recovery which validates the reducing effects of incorporating virtual layers on the epidemic spreading process.",

The entities and relationship between them are represented by vertices and edges respectively. During the past decades, various networks have been investigated, such us, the World Wide Web, transportation network, the networks of scientific and movie actors collaborations, as well as the epidemic spreading process [2] [3] [4] [5] . Nevertheless, in practice, most networks are not isolated; and they are interconnected with each other due to the existence of common components. Various infrastructures, like power supply system, water supply system, transportation system, are interacted with each other. Thus, numerous researchers recently have devoted efforts to the study of novel networks in order to investigate phenomena being absent in isolated networks [6] . Furthermore, the real-world networks usually exhibit layered properties, i.e. the links in different layer represents the connections in various environments. In this sense, these types of networks are encapsulated into the framework of multiplex networks, which seem to be applicable to modeling lots of real-world systems, like the European air transport system [7] , the global cargo ship network [8] .",

Here, the infected individuals might be recovered due to the adoption of medical treatments or self-rehabilitation. For this class of diseases, the susceptible-infected-recovered (or succinctly, SIR) model is presented in order to mimic the corresponding epidemic spreading process [18, 19] . In [20] , the SIR model is adopted to investigate the epidemic spreading process in two interacting networks numerically. Then, corresponding epidemic spreading thresholds in different communities and internetworks are determined accordingly. An analytical approach is developed in [21] , where two SIR propagations over multiplex networks are thoroughly investigated. According to previous discussions, the awareness of a susceptible individual plays an important role in the epidemic spreading process [14, 22, 23] . Hence, the SIR model is applied to multiplex networks consisting of two different layers, i.e., a virtual layer and a physical one [24] . The information is transmitting on the virtual layer through internet tools while the epidemic spreading process is performed on the physical layer. Furthermore, the dynamics of the epidemic spreading process is further investigated either simulation-based or theoretically [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] based on the traditional SIR or SIS model.",

For an infectious individual, it will be immune once recovered and will not be affected in the future. Nevertheless, the dead individual will be removed from the investigated community forever. Though the epidemic is incapable of being transmitted through either recovered or dead individuals, the recovered individual is capable of informing corresponding neighbors about the fatal epidemic. Hence, preventive measures can be taken to reduce the probability of infection, such as, reducing the frequency of outside activities, wearing face masks, washing hands frequently, taking the vaccination, doing exercises, reducing contacts with other individuals and so forth [30] [31] [32] . In this work, in order to clarify the difference between recovery and death, a susceptible-infected-recovered-dead (SIRD) model is considered to couple with the awareness dynamics, i.e., unaware-aware-unaware (UAU) model in virtual layers, being referred as a UAU-SIRD model. In this model, recovered individuals with awareness can inform susceptible neighbors who will take some preventive measures to reduce the infection probability. Nevertheless, if an infectious individual is dead, corresponding connections should be removed. Furthermore, to validate the accuracy of simulations, theoretical formulas are also derived.",

However, this seems inconsistent with empirical case: the recovery usually needs several days, or even months even under effective medical treatment. Hence, in this manuscript, the infected individual will transmit the disease to its susceptible neighbors with a prespecified probability and the infected individual is recovered after a fixed time. This recovery model is adopted and a modified probability transition tree by incorporating recovery and death is presented. Furthermore, the required recovery time steps are not necessarily to be a fixed value even under the same medical treatment. This is due to the fact of different physical conditions of the infected individuals. We make some revision to the proposed UAU-SIRD model by considering the recovery property, while theoretical analyses are also performed for validation.",

Based on the above discussion, the state transition process for an individual on the physical layer is presented in Fig. 2 , where the outgoing arrow from certain state at time t points to the possible successor state at t + 1. For example, a susceptible individual is likely to remain susceptible or be infected because of direct contacts with infected neighbors. Once infected, the individual might be in I , R or D at the next According to transitions in Fig. 2 , the transition probability tree for the epidemic spreading process on the physical layer can be indicated by Fig. 3 . Here, through practical contact, a susceptible individual might be infected; nevertheless, the probability of being infected is also affected by the state of corresponding node on the virtual layer. For instance, if a susceptible individual is unaware of the epidemic, then it is affected by the infected neighbor with probability p. Otherwise, it remains to be susceptible. This is indicated by Fig. 3 (a) . Nevertheless, if a susceptible individual is aware, then preventive measures, such as, avoiding direct contacts, might be adopted. This indicates the corresponding infection probability will be reduced, i.e., implemented by multiplying by a factor \u03b3 (0 < \u03b3 < 1) illustrated as Fig. 3 (b) . Based on the possible transitions in Fig. 3 (c) , the infectious individual might pass away with probability \u03bc d ; nevertheless, s/he is also likely to be recovered with a probability of \u03bc.

Here, s ( t ), i ( t ), r ( t ) and d ( t ) denote the fractions of individuals in different states at time t for a population with N individuals (i.e., s (t) + i (t) + r(t ) + d(t ) = 1 for any time t ).

Here, M A is defined as the fraction of individuals with awareness and M A (t) = (a (t )) / (a (t ) + u (t)) . Given the infection probability p , the number of susceptible and aware individuals being infected and switching to I state is \u03b3 p < k > s ( t ) i ( t ) M A ; whereas the number of susceptible and unaware individuals being infected is p < k > s (t ) i (t )(1 \u2212 M A ) . Furthermore, we assume a fraction \u03bc of infectious individuals are recovered during a unit time, the number of individuals swithing from I state to R state is \u03bc i ( t ). However, during a unit time, if a fraction (i.e., \u03bc d ) of infectious individuals pass away, then the number of individuals switching from I state to D state is \u03bc d i ( t ). Hence, the amount of increased infectious individuals are obtained as \u2212d Next, we also perform theoretical analysis of the scenario with recovery time t m (i.e., revised recovery model). Due to the incorporation of t m and the recovery model shown in Fig. 6 , an infectious individual can only be recovered after t m ; then the theoretical analysis varies after the appearance of recovery. If t < t m + 1, the dynamics on the physical layer is depicted by Eq. (4) ; otherwise, corresponding dynamics on the physical layer are described by Eq. (5) . As to the information spreading process on the virtual layer, corresponding dynamics can be described by Eq. (6) . Through performing iterative analysis of the formulas 4 -6 , the epidemic spreading system with the incorporation of t m can be conducted. theoretical analysis (the other parameters are the same as those of Fig. 7 ) .",

The investigated community consists of N individuals (here, N = 10 0 0 for an illustration). The size of the community varies due to the fatal property of the epidemic. Furthermore, the studied community is assumed to be composed of two-layers (i.e., a physical layer and a virtual one). Hence, the effects of incorporating virtual layer on the epidemic spreading process can also be analyzed. The analyses here are conducted through MC simulation, which is furthermore validated through theoretical analyses. Simulation stops if stationary states or anticipated time steps are achieved. For each layer, the network topology is assumed to be a WS network, where each node relates to 4 nodes with the rewiring probability 1.0. Firstly, simulations are conducted for the UAU-SIRD model in Fig. 7 (a) (the model without t m ) . For comparison, theoretical analyses are also performed through the application of the formulas 2 and 3 . We mainly focus on the evolution of fractions of susceptible/dead/infected/recovered individuals. In Fig. 7 (a) , the obtained theoretical results are denoted by solid lines while the simulation results are indicated by solid points. As we see, the accuracy of the UAU-SIRD model is validated by the theoretical analysis. In particular, Pro I increases first which is incurred by the spreading of the epidemic; nevertheless, this value reduces after reaching the peak. This is due to the reason that the infected individuals are either recovered or dead and finally vanish after reaching the stationary state.",

In such a case, preventive measures can be taken, and the infection probability is multiplied by a factor \u03b3 (0 < \u03b3 < 1). This indicates that the awareness of epidemic can reduce the infection probability of epidemic, which is also consistent with common sense. Furthermore, we can also conclude that the proportion of recovered individual will increase apparently if the virtual layer is considered.

In Fig. 8 (a) , the effect of varying parameters combination of \u03bc and \u03bb on P ro R + P ro D is obtained through simulation-based approach. For validation, theoretical analyses are also presented in Fig. 8 (b) . For fixed \u03bb, the range of individuals being affected reduces with the increase of \u03bc since more individuals will be recovered if the recovering rate increases. For fixed \u03bc, the proportion of individuals being affected reduces with the increase of \u03bb. This is due to the reason that it is more easily for the epidemic information spreading process among nodes on the virtual layer. It indicates that the susceptible individuals are more likely to become aware of epidemic. Hence, the infection probability declines as a susceptible individual with awareness takes preventive measures. This will further reduce the infection probability for susceptible individuals. It thus becomes natural that the range of individuals being affected reduces.

Through analysis, relationships between focused variables and the parameters of the community are thoroughly investigated. As indicated by the simulation results, the range of dead individuals will be reduced greatly once the information transition process on the virtual layer is incorporated. This can also be validated by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the effects of fixed recovery time on the fatal epidemic spreading is investigated; if different physical conditions (i.e., varying recovery time) are considered, analyses can be performed with modifications. In the future, the effects of immunization and isolation such as vaccination [33] [34] [35] can also be taken into consideration. Definitely, if certain individual is affected and becomes dead, this will be a warning to his/her neighbors, this alerting effect will be considered later. Furthermore, if the community movement [36] or weighted property is considered, similar analysis can be conducted with minor revisions.",
