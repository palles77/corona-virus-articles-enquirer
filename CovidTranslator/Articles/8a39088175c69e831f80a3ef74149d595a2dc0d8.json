The concept is based on the continuous emission of unipolar ions. The e ect was evaluated through the real-time monitoring of the concentration and size distribution of \u00ffne and ultra\u00ffne aerosol particles. The measurements were conducted inside and outside of a respiratory mask that was face sealed on a breathing manikin. A commonly used Type N95 respirator and surgical mask were utilized for the tests. The manikin was placed in a 24.3-m 3 indoor test chamber and exposed to polydisperse surrogate aerosols simulating viral and bacterial particles with respect to the aerodynamic size. The particle penetration through the mask was found to decrease by one-to-two orders of magnitude as a result of continuous unipolar ion emission in the chamber. The ux of air ions migrated to the breathing zone and imparted electrical charges of the same polarity to the aerosol particles and the respirator \u00fflter surface. This created an electrostatic shield along the external surface of the \u00fflter, thus enhancing the protection characteristics provided by the respirator. The above performance enhancement e ect is crucial for minimizing the infectious risk in the cases when the conventional \u00ffltering-facepiece respirators are not able to provide an adequate protection against airborne viruses and bacteria. ?",

The use of an improperly \u00fft-tested tight-\u00fftting respirator may further decrease the respiratory protection level because of the additional particle penetration that occurs through the face-seal leaks (Chen et al., 1990; Chen & Willeke, 1992; Oestenstad, Dillion, & Perkins, 1990a; Oestenstad, Perkins, & Rose, 1990b) .

Many bioaerosol agents, including viruses and bacteria that cause emerging diseases as well as those that can be used for biological warfare or in the event of bioterrorism, belong to this size range. For example, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), the dimension of the coronavirus virion (the etiological agent of the SARS) are (60-120) \u00d7 (160-200) nm, which corresponds to d a \u223c 0:1 m. For Bacillus anthracis (bacteria causing anthrax), d a \u223c 1 m. As the above range is broad and includes both the \u00ffne and ultra\u00ffne particle fractions (Baron & Willeke, 2001; Hinds, 1999) , the particle penetration e ciency through the \u00fflter media can be a ected by several mechanisms and is generally characterized by the particle aerodynamic size.

The time resolution of the instrument was adjusted to 10 s. The data were recorded in 12 ELPI channels (each channel = impaction stage), from 0.04 to 8:4 m. The latter sizes represent the midpoint diameters of the \u00ffrst and the 12th impaction stages (the midpoint = the geometric mean of the stage's boundaries). The natural aerosol concentration in the indoor test chamber was not su cient, particularly for the measurement inside the mask, because the \u00fflter removed considerable number of ambient airborne particles.

Fig. 2 shows the normalized initial aerosol concentration measured outside the respirator mask. Each data point represents an average of six replicates. It is seen that the aerosol particles were primarily within a range of d a \u2248 0:04-0:5 m (the concentration N= log d a was between \u00bf 10 4 and \u00bf 10 5 cm \u22123 ), while fewer micron-size particles were detected ( N= log d a \u223c 10 3 cm \u22123 ). For each measured particle size, the initial aerosol concentration was reproducible with the variability (the coe cient of variation) not exceeding about 50% for six replicates. Fig. 3 presents the data obtained with two types of face-sealed respirators: N95 respirator and a surgical mask. When no air ion emission was introduced, the E p -value, averaged over the test range of d a , was about 1.8% for the N95 respirator. The particle size did not considerably a ect the penetration through the N95 respirator \u00fflter, although some decrease of E p with increasing d a was observed for d a \u2248 0:04-0:5 m. Once the negative ion emission began, the penetration decreased to 0.27% during the \u00ffrst 3 min. At t = 12 min, it further decreased to about 0.11%, enhancing the N95 respirator \u00fflter performance approximately by a factor of 17 (Fig. 3a) . For the surgical mask, the initial penetration e ciency ranged from 18.7% (d a = 0:04 m) to 11.1% (d a = 1:3 m). Resulting from the emission of negative ions, the average penetration e ciency through the surgical mask dropped from 15.4% (t = 0) to 0.19% (t = 12 min), demonstrating a 80-fold enhancement (Fig. 3b) .

            "text": "It was surprising to observe that the initial penetration e ciency (t=0) of ultra\u00ffne particles through both masks slightly increased with decreasing particle size. In contrast, the available \u00ffltration models predict that the peak penetration is reached at d a between 0.1 and 0:3 m, and the particles below 0:1 m should be collected more e ciently as their size decreases (di usion regime) (Halvorsen, 1998; Hinds, 1999; Lee & Mukund, 2001) . The following considerations explain the results of our baseline test for the ultra\u00ffne particles. These models (and the laboratory-generated experimental data that support them) characterize the particle penetration through a homogeneous perfectly sealed \u00ffbrous \u00fflter material but not through a respirator mask. The design of a \u00ffltering-facepiece respirator does not assure a perfect peripheral connection of the assembly, so micro-leaks may be present between the core \u00fflter material and the elastic peripheral support. These leaks can contribute to the penetration of the ultra\u00ffne particles. In addition, although the mask was \"glued\" on the manikin, some very small, micrometer-or submicrometer-size leaks may still remain. Most of soap-bubble-based air leak detection methods are capable to identify micro-leaks greater than 1 m. If d a is much lower than the characteristic size of the micro-leaks (1 m), the particles may penetrate through these remaining submicrometer micro-leaks, thus a ecting the overall aerosol penetration e ciency through the \u00ffltering mask. One more possible factor is associated with the spatial variations in \u00ffber diameter, orientation, packing density, as well as initial \u00ffber electrostatic charge level (for those masks utilizing electret \u00fflter media). These variations have been shown to signi\u00ffcantly a ect the respirator performance increasing the penetration e ciency of particles of \u223c 0:1 m (Huang et al., 1998) .",

The emitted negative ions as well as the particles charged by these ions in the air, impose signi\u00ffcant negative charge on the respirator \u00fflter. This forms the \"electrostatic shield\" against the particles moving toward the mask. The repelling forces decrease the number of particles that can approach the \u00fflter. The above-described e ect works outside of the respirator, as opposite to the aerosol \u00ffltration by di usion, impaction, interception, and electrostatic deposition (Lee & Mukund, 2001 ) that takes place inside the \u00fflter.

It was then compared to the velocity of the air ow through the \u00fflter caused by inhalation. In this calculation, we used information about the airborne particle electric charges and the air ion density, obtained by the ELPI and the Air Ion Counter, respectively. The particle size of d a = 0:1 m was chosen, as it represents the dominant size range used in our experiments. Furthermore, this value is at the boarder line between the \u00ffne and ultra\u00ffne particle size ranges. In addition, many viral particles have an aerodynamic diameter of \u223c 0:1 m. Two main assumptions were made. First, the aerosol particles and air ions that interacted with the respirator were assumed to give all their electric charges to the respirator \u00fflter. Second, the charged \u00fflter was assumed to act as a point-charge located at the center of the respirator's surface. At the ion emission level produced in our experiment, a 0:1 m particle carries, on average, 10 elementary charges (Lee, Yermakov, & Grinshpun, 2004b) . The calculation showed that the total electric charge acquired by the respirator \u00fflter, as a result of a 3-min continued emission from the VI-2500 ion source, is about 1:5 \u00d7 10 13 elementary charges, if the breathing ow rate is 30 l min \u22121 . The ion concentration at the center of the respirator was determined to be approximately 1:6 \u00d7 10 8 cm \u22123 (this point located 20 cm from the ion emission source). Thus, the particle migration velocity was found to exceed the air ow velocity, created by the inhalation in the breathing zone, approximately by a factor of 75. This suggests that the e ect of the repelling force between the unipolarly charged particles and \u00fflter surface is much stronger than the aerodynamic force. Therefore, although our assumptions may not be su ciently conservative, the above assessment demonstrates that the enhancement of the respirator performance by the unipolar ion emission is governed by the electrostatic \"shield\" mechanism.",
