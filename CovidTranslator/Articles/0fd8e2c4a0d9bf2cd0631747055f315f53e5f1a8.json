            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is the most frequent lethal infectious disease in cats. However, understanding of FIP pathogenesis is still incomplete. Mutations in the ORF 3c/ORF 7b genes are proposed to play a role in the occurrence of the fatal FIPV biotype. Here, we investigated 282 tissue specimens from 28 cats that succumbed to FIP. Within one cat, viral sequences from different organs were similar or identical, whereas greater discrepancies were found comparing sequences from various cats. Eleven of the cats exhibited deletions in the 3c gene, resulting in truncated amino acid sequences. The 7b gene was affected by deletions only in one cat. In three of the FIP cats, coronavirus isolates with both intact 3c genes as well as 7b genes of full length could also be detected. Thus, deletions or stop codons in the 3c sequence seem to be a frequent but not compelling feature of FIPVs.",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis is a widely distributed, fatal disease in felidae occurring as two clinical forms: effusive and granulomatous. An efficient vaccine or therapy does not exist. The aetiologic agent is the feline coronavirus (FCoV) that occurs as two different biotypes: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). It has been assumed that the FIPV biotype arises by as yet unidentified mutation(s) of FECV strains in individual cats (Chang et al., 2010 (Chang et al., , 2012 Pedersen et al., 2009; Poland et al., 1996; Vennema, 1999; Vennema et al., 1998) . In contrast to the fatal course of FIPV infections, infection with FECV only contributes to a subclinical stage of disease where cats exhibit mild diarrhoea or no clinical signs at all. Morphologically or antigenetically, the different biotypes cannot be distinguished from each other. Another classification subdivides feline coronaviruses into serotype I and serotype II strains. This classification system is based on the relationship to canine coronavirus (CCoV). FCoV type II strains developed from recombination of a type I strain with a CCoV (Herrewegh et al., 1998; Motokawa et al., 1996) . Classification as type I or type II strains does not give any information about the virulence. Both type I and II strains contain highly virulent FIPVs as well as low virulent FECVs (Pedersen et al., 1984) . In vitro cultivation of type I strains has proven to be very difficult, whereas type II strains grow well in cell culture. Unfortunately, in this respect field infections are predominantly caused by serotype I isolates (Benetka et al., 2004; Hohdatsu et al., 1992; Kummrow et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2009a) . Independent from bio-and serotypes, FCoVs show a relatively high mutational rate during the course of virus replication (Lai et al., 2007) . Therefore, complex virus populations or so-called quasi species could be detected in FCoV isolates (Battilani et al., 2003; Gunn-Moore et al., 1999) . To date, the mechanisms of FIP pathogenesis are not fully understood. After oropharyngeal uptake of FCoVs, they predominantly infect the epithelial cells of the gut (Herrewegh et al., 1997; Kipar et al., 2010; Stoddart et al., 1988) . The infection of monocytes/ macrophages and thereby the systemic spread of the virus had been considered to be the determining step in FIP development in the past (Pedersen et al., 1981) . Today, it is known that FCoV genome can be detected in the blood even in clinically healthy cats (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Herrewegh et al., 1995a Herrewegh et al., , 1997 Kipar et al., 1999) . Indeed, FIPVs seem to replicate more effectively in macrophages than FECVs (Dewerchin et al., 2005; Stoddart and Scott, 1989) . The viral spike protein was identified to play an important role for infection and macrophage tropism (Rottier et al., 2005) . Chang et al. (2012) identified two alternative amino acid differences in the spike protein that are supposed to distinguish FECV and FIPV in a high percentage of cases. Recently, Porter et al. (2014) put into perspective these findings by detecting the assumed FIP-specific mutations also in coronavirus-infected cats without any signs of FIP.",

            "text": "Furthermore, Balint et al. (2012) observed a difference in the replication efficiency of FIPV strains with intact and deleted ORF 3abc genes. The latter exhibited more effective replication in macrophages than do FIPVs with intact ORF 3abc. In contrast, another study detected a crucial role of ORF 7ab in FIPV replication in monocytes/macrophages and not in ORF 3abc (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2013) . Additionally, the ORF 7a unit combined with ORF 3-encoded proteins seems to be an effective antagonist of IFN-alpha-induced anti-viral response (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2014) . The above mentioned genomic regions belong to FCoV nonstructural or accessory genes. Products of the 7a and 7b genes are small, secretory glycoproteins whereas the function of ORF 3a, 3b or 3c is not known (De Groot et al., 1988; Vennema et al., 1992a Vennema et al., , 1992b . In several studies, sequence variation could be detected in the nonstructural protein genes of FIPVs compared to FECVs (Chang et al., 2010; Pedersen et al., 2009; Vennema et al., 1992b Vennema et al., , 1998 . Most frequently, deletions in the 3c gene were found in FIPVs that were not present in FECVs. This led to the assumption that deletions in ORF 3c may result in an increase of virulence even if FIPV strains with intact ORF 3c could be found as well. On the other hand, deletions in ORF 7b were considered to play a role in virus attenuation (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2013; Herrewegh et al., 1995b; Vennema et al., 1998) . The relevance of all these findings is still controversial (Balint et al., 2012; Brown et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2010; Dedeurwaerder et al., 2013 Dedeurwaerder et al., , 2014 Kennedy et al., 2001 Kennedy et al., , 2006 Kiss et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2009b; Pedersen et al., 2009 Pedersen et al., , 2012 Porter et al., 2014; Tekes et al., 2012; Vennema et al., 1998) .",

But despite numerous investigations of the FCoV genome, no definite discrimination between FECV and FIPV on the molecular level has been described until now. Nevertheless, an involvement of nonstructural protein genes 3c and 7b is widely accepted in the literature (Chang et al., 2010; Herrewegh et al., 1995b; Pedersen et al., 2009; Vennema et al., 1998) . The selection of published FCoV strains (NCBI GenBank\u00ae) for comparison to the FIPV isolates revealed high sequence variation in the 3c and lower variation in the 7b gene. This reflects the high mutation rate of coronaviruses in general. Regarding the gene length, ORF 7b showed 621 bases except in two cell culture-adapted strains. ORF 3c exhibits 714 bases in all feline coronaviruses described as FECV. According to the hypothesis, FIPVs are thought to carry deletions in the 3c gene. This is the case in FIPV Black (acc. no.: EU186072) and an isolate from a cat with FIP (acc. no.: DQ848578) that showed a gene length of 695 and 694 bases, respectively. In contrast, FIPV 79-1146 (acc. no.: NC__007025) and another FIPV strain (acc. no.: AY994055) exhibit a gene length of 733 and 735 bases, respectively. Therefore, ORF 3c of FIPV can also be affected by insertions. These insertions, however, occurred in cell cultureadapted type II strains which potentially carry mutations that are not present in naturally occurring FIPVs.",

The results of the present study indicate that of these newly arisen variants only one type or very few strains become manifest in one cat systemically.",

It remains questionable if the increased frequency of mutations in ORF 3c in FIPVs is one of the primary causes for the occurrence of the fatal FIPV biotype or developed secondary during a FIP outbreak. Vennema et al. (1998) hypothesised that the virulence of FCoV might be determined by an interaction of the nonstructural 3c and 7b genes. Whereas an intact 7b gene is thought to play a role for virulence, an intact 3c gene (which is the case in FECV) is considered to prevent the virulent potential of 7b. In case of deleted 3c (what is postulated to be the case in FIPV), inhibition of virulence encoded by 7b should not be possible. These considerations are complicated by the fact that only little is known about the function and products of ORF 3c and ORF 7b. To gain more insight into the amino acid sequences of putative proteins, all nucleotide sequences were translated. The occurrence of deletions usually resulted in disruption of the amino acid sequences. In all PCR-positive tissues of 14/ 19 cats with complete 3c sequence data, premature stop codons could be observed. However, not all of the nucleic acid deletions resulted in the generation of stop codons. On the other hand, stop codons also occurred in sequences without deletions, but with single nucleotide exchanges. Of the remaining 5/19 cats without premature stop codons two cats exhibited deletions in their sequences. Three out of 19 cats showed complete sequences of 714 bases and no premature stop codons. Summing up, the occurrence of premature stop codons is not inevitably associated with deletions in the nucleic acid sequence.",

Nevertheless, three cats with isolates containing both intact 3c and intact 7b genes occurred in this study. Because of this, 3c and 7b genes cannot be the only factor determining the virulence potential of a FCoV strain. Presumably, mutations in other genes or a complex interaction between the feline immune system and as yet unidentified feline coronavirus properties take place. The attempt to ascribe one or several defined mutations to the FIP-causing FCoV failed until now. The results of some earlier studies in which presumable FIPspecific mutations were found in the spike or 3c gene, respectively, sounded promising (Chang et al., 2012; Pedersen et al., 2009) . The present study and other research groups relativised these findings by detecting FIPV strains that do not carry those mutations (Porter et al., 2014) .",

A possible explanation of the latter of the two hypotheses could be that high sequence variability in the primer binding sites exists. The results gained after semi-nested PCR were 3cspecific and exhibited distinct bands on gel electrophoresis. Thus, large deletions at primer binding sites can be ruled out. The observed differences in detectability of both nonstructural protein genes therefore led to the assumption of different RNA amounts of ORF 3c and ORF 7b. During virus replication of coronaviruses several subgenomic mRNAs are synthesised (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Masters, 2006) . Whether the isolates amplified in the present study originated from genomic RNA or mRNA is not known. Presumably, both variants were present in the tissues. Different amounts of 3c and 7b RNA can only be explained by quantitative differences in the subgenomic mRNAs because genomic RNA presumably contains all viral genes in equal parts. Different amounts of subgenomic mRNAs might be the result of a regulatory mechanism restricting the 3c mRNA synthesis or fostering degradation. Another possibility might be that the 3c gene is not translated into a corresponding protein. These considerations are speculative and have to be investigated in further studies.",

The further the branches of the diagram are from each other, the more variations exist between sequences of different cats. The bar length gives information about the relative number of sequence variations between adjacent strains. but one of the 26 positive cats exhibited an identical length of ORF 7b of 621 bases. Only one cat showed two deletions of three bases each resulting in a length of 615 bases.",
