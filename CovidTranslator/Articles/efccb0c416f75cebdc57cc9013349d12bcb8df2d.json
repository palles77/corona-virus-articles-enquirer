Out of this human calamity has come renewed attention to global health security-its defi nition, meaning, and the practical implications for programmes and policy. For example, how does a government begin to strengthen its core public health capacities, as demanded by the International Health Regulations? What counts as a global health security concern? In the context of the governance of global health, including WHO reform, it will be important to distil lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak. The Lancet invited a group of respected global health practitioners to refl ect on these lessons, to explore the idea of global health security, and to off er suggestions for next steps. Their contributions describe some of the major threats to individual and collective human health, as well as the values and recommendations that should be considered to counteract such threats in the future. Many diff erent perspectives are proposed. Their common goal is a more sustainable and resilient society for human health and wellbeing.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] As the Ebola virus crosses national borders, there is clear understanding that the outbreaks in west Africa are a threat to our health security-people with infection have travelled across borders within Africa and to Europe and to North America where they have unintentionally caused small chains of transmission far from the epicentre of the outbreak. The Ebola crisis has put the spotlight on the importance of reducing the vulnerability of societies to infectious disease threats that spread across national borders. This aspect of health security-collective health security-has been the focus of attention and the commonly understood conceptualisation of health security for centuries. The paradigm today is rapid detection of these events, and rapid response. But there is a second, equally important aspect to health security that is less appreciated that the west Africa Ebola outbreaks have also tragically highlighted: individual health security. This is security that comes from access to safe and eff ective health services, products, and technologies. Ebola-infected health workers from developed countries have been repatriated from west Africa for care in their own countries where there is health security for individuals-hospitals that provide safe and eff ective access to life-saving medicines and services. Meanwhile, Ebola-infected west Africans have had to accept that health care is not always safe, not always eff ective, and not always accessible-that their own health security is yet again at risk. As the Ebola epidemic has unfolded, the part that has been played by substandard infection control and inadequate access to eff ective health products and services has clearly demonstrated a wider scope of health security-the intertwining of collective and individual health security.",

As international travel and trade increased, a series of international treaties and conventions were developed to attempt to stop the cross-border spread of plague and three additional infectious diseases-cholera, smallpox, and yellow fever. 6 In 1969 the International Health Regulations set out a collaborative global framework to enhance the world's health security against these four infectious diseases with a reporting requirement and predetermined actions to be implemented at borders. 7, 8 After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and the strong reminder that border controls cannot stop the international spread of disease, the International Health Regulations were broadened in scope. 9 They now require reporting of any public health emergency of international concern and real-time dialogue among aff ected governments and WHO to propose real-time, evidence-based actions at borders; they also require countries to strengthen eight core capacities in public health aimed at more rapid detection and response to public health events where and when they occur. 10 Although these requirements have not been met in all countries, 11,12 the regulations provide an agreed global framework for enhancement of collective health security-a framework for investment by countries and development agencies to strengthen public health so that outbreaks caused by infectious organisms such as Ebola can be rapidly detected and contained.",

The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), established by WHO and UNICEF in the late 1970s, was not developed to provide a vaccine as a means to protect collective health security. It was established to save the individual lives of children. 18 EPI now provides sustained vaccine supplies to countries at minimum or no cost, and prevents tetanus, pertussis, measles, diphtheria, and polio in countries where health systems successfully deliver these vaccines. One of these diseases, polio, is now scheduled for eradication. Access to polio vaccine has thus satisfi ed an individual health security need and at the same time led to herd immunity, which has enhanced collective health security by eliminating polio in all but three countries, and will hopefully lead to eradication. 19 The GAVI Alliance followed the establishment of EPI and provides newer vaccines to countries. Development agencies have continued to contribute to GAVI for the health security of individuals without the need to justify vaccination as a requirement for collective health security.",

Equally important are eff ective top-down actions. Like a fi re brigade, the top-down global responses to Ebola must link eff ectively to local action. Yet, the plethora of global responses have been found wanting. The sentinel warnings of non-governmental organisations and the heroism of international volunteers have been heartwarming, but criticisms of inadequate and delayed action by international agencies, especially WHO, have been wake-up calls. Yet, WHO is an under-resourced and undermandated intergovernmental organisation where member states insist on preserving their absolute sovereignty in a world where viruses do not respect political borders or authority.",

            "text": "A seminal change in global health during the past 20 years involved the framing of specifi c health problems as security threats and development of a strategy to achieve global health security. This strategy connected global health with core political interests of states, transformed the responsibilities of WHO, and produced the revised International Health Regulations. 10 However, the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in west Africa damaged the strategy's political, institutional, and legal pillars. It revealed countries' lack of political commitment, battered WHO's credibility, and weakened the International Health Regulations. Resurrection of global health security will need restoration of each pillar. Unfortunately, the damage exposes challenges that states previously have failed to handle, including sustaining global health as a political priority, reforming WHO, and improving compliance with international health law. In view of the diffi culty of what is needed, whether the Ebola outbreak can rejuvenate global health security is far from clear. How Ebola went from \"an exotic tropical disease to a priority for global health security\" 35 involves a backstory in which WHO and its member states built and then undermined the strategy for global health security. Starting in the mid-1990s, WHO crafted new approaches to dangerous disease events, such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) 36 and the revised International Health Regulations. Outbreaks, including SARS and pandemic infl uenza H1N1, tested these innovations. In 2010-11, the International Health Regulations Review Committee analysed the H1N1 pandemic, acknowledged positive features of the response, and identifi ed problems with the regulations and WHO's ability to address health emergencies. Warning \"the world is ill-prepared\" to handle any \"sustained and threatening public-health emergency\", the Committee recommended improving compliance with the regulations and WHO's capacities to manage dangerous disease events. 12 WHO did not adopt these recommendations. Concerns about global health security informed WHO's reform process, which started in 2010, but the process failed to support the Review Committee's recommendations or strengthen WHO's responsibilities in this area. The 2012 deadline for meeting obligations on surveillance and response capacities in the International Health Regulations passed with most countries not in compliance. 37 The Review Committee also fl agged this issue, 12 but WHO's reform process did nothing about it. When fi scal diffi culties forced decisions about priorities, WHO cut funding and staffi ng for its surveillance and response activities, 38 rejecting Review Committee proposals for strengthening them. 12 The cuts refl ected WHO's strategic choice to de-emphasise global health security and increase attention on problems outside the global health security realm, including noncommunicable diseases. The reform process also failed to tackle long recognised problems with WHO's regional and country offi ces that undermine the organisation's eff ectiveness.",

A governance system is needed to prioritise product development according to unmet health needs, and mechanisms that will allow diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines to be developed without an immediate fi nancial reward, but, as conditions might warrant, left on the shelves until the next outbreak occurs, or kept in reserve until bacteria become resistant to fi rst-line therapies. This arrangement is by sharp contrast with the current motive of maximising sales, which leads to massive overuse of some drugs, and necessitates regulation of the way drugs are deployed, prescribed, and used for instance to minimise the misuse of crucial antibiotics and prolong their lifespan. 78 The Ebola crisis off ered an opportunity to pilot a diff erent paradigm of health-needs-driven research and development, 79 as a collective action under public leadership and primarily fi nanced with public funds, allowing open access to data, resources, and research aids, building a shared evidence base of so far fragmented knowledge, mobilising the research community to contribute to problem solving through crowdsourcing, and managing creatively intellectual property for products to be available as public goods. Sadly, so far this has not happened; our current research and development ecosystem lacks the needed leadership and governance to prioritise research, resulting in fragmentation, diverging priorities, controversies over study design, 80 and now competition for access to study sites and patients. 81 Despite best intentions, we were unprepared this time again to overcome the systemic defi ciencies of our research and development model. Research and development and access to diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments are crucial to achievement of health security, and cannot be left to market forces. Public leadership, direction, and accountability are needed for creative rethinking of a research and development system that urgently needs to be fi xed.",

The response to the Haiti earthquake, for example, drew health workers away from the public health system, caused patients to preferentially use the facilities provided by aid organisations, and introduced cholera into the country. 101 Finding ways to anticipate and mitigate these negative eff ects should be a priority for donors and agencies.",

In response most neighbouring countries tried to close their borders, industrialised countries such as Australia imposed temporary visa restrictions on all immigrants from these countries, and several airlines stopped fl ying to the aff ected countries. Yet evidence from previous health crises demonstrates that they rarely result in large scale international migration, that where they do travel bans do not always work, and that the unintended consequences of travel bans might be more harmful than the problem they are intended to address. 113 There are fi ve wider lessons to learn from these migration responses to Ebola, and their overall lack of eff ectiveness, for understanding the relation between international migration and global health security, and generating positive feedback loops. First, the Ebola crisis has reinforced that more research is needed on the eff ect of health crises on international migration, to inform more eff ective policy making. An historical review of health crises has indicated that they rarely result in large scale migration. 114 When it has occurred, as for example from Beijing during the 2003 SARS outbreak, migration tends to be internal, temporary, and early on in the health crisis. It has been diffi cult to discern disease from other underlying factors such as poverty and persecution where international migration has occurred during health crises, for example during the cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe in 2009. 115 Overall the evidence is scarce, anecdotal, and hard to verify. Empirical challenges involve identifi cation of and access to aff ected populations; conceptual challenges include attribution and distinguishing of health from other motivations to migrate.",

It was then that Chancellor Otto von Bismarck linked Germany's national security to collective, state action to ensure the health and social security of individual workers. 119 This linkage was asserted more generally in the 20th century, by the two architects of today's global security framework-Winston Churchill and Franklin Rooseveltwho both accepted, as political liberals, the importance of building their own nations' security on a strong foundation of shared social solidarity and emphasised the importance to global security of ensuring that all people in all nations should live in freedom from fear and want. 120 Individual health security cannot be separated from this broader concept of human security that is concerned with all threats to human wellbeing. The availability of essential services, technologies, and medicines is not possible if fi nancial and other barriers prevent individuals from accessing them when they are needed and health care is not made available in a socially equitable manner. Further, freedom from fear and want-the essence of human security-also means ensuring that all individuals have adequate protection against the fi nancial risks of medical care, which in many countries remains a leading cause of poverty and threat to individual wellbeing. 121 Universal health coverage is fundamentally about meeting these needs-universal, equitable access to health care with fi nancial protection-and is indispensable for achievement of individual health security and, therefore, collective health and human security. Universal health coverage can only be achieved through collective action led by governments, both within their own borders and across borders when international cooperation is needed. A wider concept of health and human security in keeping with the original vision that created the UN Security Council is needed that acknowledges that global security is more easily achieved when, in all countries, all people can \"obtain the health services they need without suff ering fi nancial hardship when paying for them\". 122 This is the goal of universal health coverage.",

This scenario necessitates wealthier members of society contributing more than the poor. Global experience shows that maintenance of such an equitable system requires the state to play a major part in setting and enforcing laws compelling the healthy and wealthy members of society to subsidise services for the sick and the poor. As a result, universal health coverage can only be achieved with a heavy reliance on public fi nancing mechanisms-in particular through general taxation and compulsory progressive social insurance systems. This reliance was one of the major fi ndings of the recent Lancet Commission on investing in health, which advocated for increasing public fi nancing to reach universal health coverage through \"progressive universalism\". 123 In eff ect, the international response to the recent threat to global health security posed by the Ebola virus refl ects this approach. In the absence of adequate public fi nancing, the aff ected countries were not able to provide eff ective health coverage and were left extremely vulnerable to the shock caused by Ebola. The ensuing epidemic has severely compromised individual, national, and global health security. As the President of the World Bank has argued, this crisis would probably not have occurred in those African countries with demonstrably higher levels of eff ective health coverage. 124 To counteract this threat to global health security, public fi nancing from wealthy donor nations has fi nanced universal coverage of Ebola-related services for individuals in these countries, for whom these services would have been totally unaff ordable had they been available. One could argue that, in addition to eff orts for smallpox, and then polio eradication, this response represents a rare example where the world has shown a real commitment to achievement of true universal coverage, such that everybody receives the services they need with the costs fully subsidised by globally pooled resources.",

            "text": "So why does universal health coverage matter to the wider goals of global health and human security and might it also have other benefi ts for development? First, if we consider the emergence of some infectious diseases of global concern (for example, artemisinin-resistant malaria, SARS, and Ebola), they occurred in settings without universal health coverage where health systems were unable to perform eff ective public health functions and deliver essential medical services, including hospital care for the grievously ill. In the current Ebola crisis, the longstanding lack of access to basic primary care, laboratories with insuffi cient capacity, and shortage of existing hospital infrastructure to isolate and treat infected people left communities with little trust in the health system, families with no help to tend for their seriously ill members, and fuelled the spread of the epidemic and its resulting death toll.",

            "text": "In an interconnected world, the availability of accessible and universal health-care services in all countries is the crucial fi rst line of defence for all against such threats to health. Instilling trust in communities needs access to health systems that provide a comprehensive breadth of essential health care. Communities do not compartmentalise their health issues into vertical pillars. If they cannot access quality maternal health or diabetes care, it erodes their faith in the same systems later pursuing them to manage Ebola and other infectious threats. Additionally, the health security threat of non-communicable diseases cannot be mitigated without provision of horizontally integrated primary care that can prevent, diagnose, and manage a wide range of illnesses. Unless all countries have eff ective universal health coverage, populations will also be inclined to travel across borders to seek care, increasing the potential for infection to spread and posing social and economic burdens and possible threats to law and order in other nations. Indeed, Ebola has been seeded and reseeded in the three countries most aff ected by the current epidemic as people moved across borders in search of social support and health care. 125 Second, universal health coverage can substantially improve human security by providing fi nancial security against impoverishing medical costs. In Thailand, for example, extension of health coverage to the entire population reduced annual impoverishment from medical costs from 2\u00b771% of the population to 0\u00b749% in 10 years. 126 Achievement of the fi nancial protection goal enshrined in universal health coverage can therefore be an eff ective strategy to reduce poverty and ensure human security.",

Fear and uncertainty concerning the fi nancial consequences of ill health and inequitable access represent large welfare losses to populations. 127 Concern about falling fi nancial access to health services has sometimes resulted in political demonstrations and violent unrest. 128 In responding to these pressures, some governments have launched socialised health fi nancing reforms primarily to reduce political tensions and improve national security. This has been the case in China, where the architect of their recent health reforms suggested that his government's main motivation in achieving universal health coverage had been to bring about \"a more harmonious society\". 129 Therefore, as well as being a means to deliver improved health security, universal health coverage can also improve economic security for households, strengthen social solidarity systems resulting in improved national security, and has even been used to facilitate unpopular climate change policies. 130 Advancement of the goal of universal health coverage can therefore simultaneously address several key development priorities, in addition to strengthening global health security. In view of these substantial economic, welfare, and political benefi ts, there is a strong case that universal health coverage should be regarded as a development goal in its own right.",
