However, its pathological characteristics were not adequately investigated. In our preliminary in vitro investigation, ECoV-induced cell death was observed in bovine kidney-derived MDBK cells. Based on this finding, we investigated whether the ECoV-induced CPE was apoptosis. Following ECoV infection, MDBK cells showed morphological changes such as cell rounding and detachment from the culture surface. Moreover, syncytium formation was observed as the other type of cytopathic effect in ECoV infection. Morphologic and biochemical features of apoptosis, such as nuclear fragmentation and DNA ladder formation, were also detected in ECoV-infected cells. Moreover, as is commonly observed in coronavirus infection in other animals, the activities of effecter caspases -caspase-3/7 -and initiator caspases -caspase-8 and caspase-9 -that are representative factors in the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, respectively, were increased in ECoV-infected MDBK cells. Therefore, it was suggested that ECoV can induce apoptosis in MDBK cells via a caspase-dependent pathway. Apoptotic death of infected cells is detrimental because it causes cell and tissue destruction and inflammatory responses. Although the pathological characteristics of ECoV are largely unknown, apoptosis may be the pathological basis of lesions of the digestive system in ECoV infection. #",

            "text": "ECV-infected cells also showed syncytium formation prior to apoptosis induction. Syncytium formation has been previously reported in some coronaviruses (Kusanagi et al., 1992; Lavi et al., 1996; Li and Cavanagh, 1992) . In a study on group II coronaviruses, MHV-3-infected macrophages from BALB/c mice showed syncytium formation and apoptosis, but the cell populations that showed the 2 phenomena were different (Belyavsky et al., 1998) . In contrast, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)infected Vero cells showed syncytium formation followed by caspase-dependent apoptosis (Liu et al., 2001) . These findings indicate that since IBV belongs to group III coronaviruses, ECoV and IBV are considerably separated on the phylogenetic tree based on genome sequences but are similar with respect to biological behavior . IBV is known as a prototype virus of the Coronaviridae family. Therefore, it is conceivable that ECoV has genetically evolved into a group II coronavirus but has conserved the functions of the Coronaviridae family. Fig. 2 . Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA from ECV-infected cells. DNA fragmentation was observed at and after 12 HAI, but was prominent at 18 and 21 HAT. M: 100 bp DNA marker (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan), 0-24: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 , and 24 HAT, respectively. Caspases are cysteine proteases that play fundamental roles in the apoptotic responses of cells to different stimuli. In particular, caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 are classified as effecter caspases that are activated by the respective initiator caspases in the death receptor-mediated and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways and can be considered as key enzymes involved in apoptosis since they are indispensable for chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. In the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway, caspase-8 is the initiator caspase that is activated by the interaction between external apoptotic factors and cell surface molecules such as Fas or Fas ligand via adaptor proteins such as Fas-associated death domain (FADD) (Cohen, 1997) . On the other hand, in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, caspase-9 is the initiator caspase whose activity is regulated by the expression balance between Bcl-2 and Bax via cytochrome c/Apaf-1 complex formation (Cohen, 1997; Strasser et al., 2000) . In ECoV-infected MDBK cells, caspase-3/7 activity was increased at and after 15 HAT, and caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities were increased at and after 12 HAT. These results indicate that ECoV can induce caspasedependent apoptosis in MDBK cells via both the death receptor-mediated and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. However, the activation of the initiator caspase-8 can also be related to the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via cleavage of Bid (a member of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family) and translocation of the truncated Bid to mitochondria . In some coronaviruses, both initiator caspases are activated in the course of apoptosis; the Fas-signaling pathway in which both initiator caspases are activated via cleavage and translocation of Bid was suggested as the mechanism of apoptosis, particularly in MHV infection (Eleouet et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2006; Liu and Zhang, 2007) . Therefore, it was speculated that ECoV also induces apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway that may be activated by an interaction between virus protein and cell surface signaling factors with participation of both the death receptor-mediated and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. However, further investigations that will focus on the kinetics of signal transduction factors are necessary to clarify the detailed mechanisms of ECoV-induced apoptosis.",
