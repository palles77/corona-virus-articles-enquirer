            "text": "most commonly reported respiratory disease of poultry globally (Thor et al., 2011) . The first case of IB was reported in the US in 1930 by Schalk and Hawn (1931) which subsequently spread to other parts of the world (Fabricant, 1998) . In Nigeria, however, the first documented evidence of suspected IB disease was by Adene and Ojo (1976) . Since the first report in Nigeria, there seems to have been a progressive increase in the prevalence of IB in the country without much attention compared with other prevailing poultry diseases like Newcastle, Gumboro, and avian influenza. Komolafe et al. (1990) reported a seroprevalence of 3.3% from the south-eastern part of Nigeria. Thereafter, other reports have established high (15.3%-89%) seroprevalence of IB (Emikpe et al., 2010; Mungadi et al., 2015; Oyejide et al., 1988; Owoade et al., 2006) but none of these studies have identified the different serotypes in circulation nor attempt to establish a causal relationship with marked drop in egg production. In another report, Ducatez et al. (2009) identified a novel genotype of IBV from birds with inapparent signs of infection in South West Nigeria. Unlike Newcastle disease (ND) which is relatively well studied in Nigeria and has been known to be enzootic (Adu et al., 1986; Nwanta et al., 2008; Shittu et al., 2015; Solomon et al., 2012) , IB is less studied and understood with only a few reports available in the public domain on the epidemiology and control in the country. Based on the previous serological reports, the incidence of IB seems to be on the increase across the country (Emikpe et al., 2010) . In this investigation, we sought to identify the causative agents of reported case of respiratory disease and drop in egg production in Plateau State, Nigeria. Recently, however, reports of rampant occurrences of respiratory diseases and drop in egg productions have risen in Plateau state, Nigeria (personal communication: Moses GD). This study, therefore, investigates one of such occurrences with the view of identifying the aetiologic agent(s) and determine the seroprevalence of three IBV serotypes in the flock.",

The birds were sourced from a farm that raised birds for point-of-lay sales at the age of 14 wk. According to the farmer's record, all necessary vaccines (Mareks disease, ND, infectious bursal disease, Fowl typhoid, and Fowl pox) had been administered including a trivalent (ND, IB, and egg drop syndrome) killed oil-emulsion vaccine. There was no record of initial priming with live attenuated IBV vaccine. Birds came into lay at the age of about 22 wk and production never reached 80%. At the time of this investigation, the flock size stood at 1,062 laying chickens. During the course of production, many birds were lost without confirmation of the cause of death. Dead birds were collected and subjected to post-mortem examination. At necropsy, lungs, trachea, liver, and spleen were harvested for virological examination by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and isolation in embryonating chicken eggs (ECE). Homogenate (20%) of pooled tissue (lungs, trachea, liver, and spleen) was made by grinding in chilled mortar and pestle with addition of phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing Penicillin (2,000 units/ml), Streptomycin (2 mg/ml), Gentamycin (50 \u00b5g/ml), and Amphotericin B (5 mg/ml) as contained in the OIE Manual of Diagnostics (2008). The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min and supernatant stored at \u221280 o C until used. Viral RNA extraction Viral RNA was extracted from the homogenate and ALF samples using QIAmp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). In addition, NDV Ulster 2C (IZSVe, Padua, Italy), IBV M-41 strain (Charles River Laboratories, CT), and AIV H5N2 (IZSVe, Padua, Italy) were extracted as positive controls, while nuclease-free water was used as a negative control. The RNA extracts were eluted in 60-\u00b5l elution buffer according to the manufacturer's instruction and stored at \u221280 o C for further analysis.",

As at the time of sampling, egg production had dropped by approximately 55%. Mortality was observed before the birds came into lay and continued during lay with a range of 1%-2%. At post-mortem, lesions observed include cloudy air sacs, frothy and congested lungs, whitish, cheesy materials on the serosal surface of the intestine, white nodules on the surface of the ventricles, proventriculus and intestines, and presence of ascitic fluid in the abdomen. These signs and lesions are consistent with findings from previous reports (Awad et al., 2014b; Ballal et al., 2005) . Due to the similarities in clinical and pathological lesions presented by infections involving respiratory viruses, clinician that based their diagnosis on these non-pathognomonic signs may miss the aetiological agents. Though the mortality rate in the affected flock was low (1%-2%), it is consistent with the report by Awad et al. (2014a) . Generally, single infections with IBV result in low mortality. However, exacerbation by concurrent infection with other pathogens of viral or bacterial origin have been reported (Jackwood, 2012) . As shown in Figure 1 , the tissue homogenate was positive for IBV by RT-PCR and negative for AIV and NDV. Upon inoculation of ECEs with the tissue homogenate, no noticeable changes were observed in the embryos in the first few passages. However, at passage four, embryo death with characteristic IB lesions, including curling, dwarfing, and hemorrhages on the embryos (13 d of age) were conspicuously discernible (Fig. 2) . Allantoic fluids harvested from the eggs of both dead and live embryos did not cause agglutination of chicken red blood cells in spot hemagglutination test (data not shown) and this confirms the absence of hemagglutinating agent. In this study, we have shown that IBV which is less described and often given less attention and not NDV or AIV was the causative agent of infection in the 54-wk-old laying birds showing respiratory signs and severe drop in egg production. Although ND was first suspected by the consulting clinician due to its enzootic status in Nigeria. In a limited study, the prevalence of IB was found to equal that of ND confirming the increasing important enzootic status of IB in Nigeria poultry (Shittu unpublished data) . In this study, successful isolation of IBV in embryonating eggs was accomplished after four blind passages with the embryos developing lesions characteristic of IB such as stunting and dwarfing (Fig.  2) . For IBV isolation, ECE and tracheal organ cultures (TOC) are substrates of choice although TOC has an edge over ECE in that stasis of the tracheal cilia could Callison et al., 2006 http://www.openveterinaryjournal.com I. Shittu et al. Open Veterinary Journal, (2019 , Vol. 9(1): 74-80 be observed in the former upon primary inoculation (OIE, 2008) . In this study, ECE isolation technique was found to be equally useful. According to the farm records, the birds were vaccinated with inactivated oil-emulsion vaccine which contained IBV antigen. However, this seemed not to have protected the birds against morbidity, mortality, and decreased egg production. It has been reported that chickens with low antibody level to IBV serotype could experience severe drop in egg production, whereas those with high antibody level are less affected in terms of egg quality and production possibly as a result of immune protection (Ballal et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Available literature show that the use of inactivated IB vaccines alone does not confer adequate protection on the birds except where they are first primed with live attenuated IB vaccines during the early stages of production (Cook et al., 2012) . In addition, IBV serotypes do not cross-protect (Jackwood et al., 2010) , thus the vaccine must be designed based on circulating serotypes in the locality. In Plateau State, there are no available data on the circulating IBV strains. Although most vaccines being used on the field in Nigeria are predominatly Mass serotype, detection of other serotypes in this investigation is a further indication and support speculation that the vaccine strains being http://www.openveterinaryjournal.com I. Shittu et al. Open Veterinary Journal, (2019), Vol. 9 (1): 74-80 used differ from some of the serotypes in circulation. Furthermore, Ducatez et al. (2009) identified a novel IBV serotype \"IBADAN\" from southwestern Nigeria and no information exists on the ability of the vaccine strains in use to protect birds against this novel strain (de Wit et al., 2010) . It is, however, not known if this serotype circulates in the northern part of the country. Antibody prevalence and high GMT titre distribution of the three serotypes of IBV used in the study for Mass, Conn, and Ark are 490.5, 215.3, and 534.9 , respectively, as shown in Tables 2 and 3 . In all 32 serum samples tested, 100% seropositivity was also observed for Mass, Conn, and Ark serotypes. In addition, concurrent infections with Mass/Conn, Mass/Ark, Conn/Ark, and Mass/Conn/Ark serotypes were observed. Interestingly, the HI results for the three serotypes (Mass, Conn, and Ark) tested in this study revealed 100% seropositivity (Table 2 ). This clearly shows that the three IBV serotypes are present in the farm and may be in circulation in Plateau State with the possibility of other hitherto unreported serotypes. As reported by Jackwood (2012) , several serotypes and variants of IBV circulate around the world with some having specificity for a particular location, making them indigenous to those places. Such may include the newly described serotype by Ducatez et al. (2009) which we could not test for in our samples due to unavailability of strain specific diagnostic reagent. The Mass strain of IBV has been reported to be widespread across the globe possibly due to its use as a vaccine (de Wit et al., 2010) . In Nigeria, breeder stocks are often vaccinated with live IBV vaccine using Mass-like strains at much younger ages (Ducatez et al., 2009) . However, in this case, a trivalent killed-adjuvanted vaccine containing IBV was said to have been administered without prior priming with live IBV vaccine. As previously reported (Bijlenga et al., 2004; de Wit et al., 2010) , antibody response to killed-adjuvanted IBV vaccine without priming the birds with live attenuated IB vaccine are usually poor. It can, therefore, be deduced that the high titre of antibodies to the three IBV serotypes detected in this study (Table 3) may not have emanated from vaccination, but could be a result of recent or continuous infection with circulating strains of the virus as also shown by molecular detection and virus isolation.",
