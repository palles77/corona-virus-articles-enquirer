            "text": "The prolonged and localized delivery of nitric oxide (NO), a potent antithrombotic and antimicrobial agent, has many potential biomedical applications. In this work, the origin of the longterm storage stability and sustained NO release mechanism of Snitroso-N-acetyl-D-penicillamine (SNAP)-doped CarboSil 20 80A polymer, a biomedical thermoplastic silicone-polycarbonate-urethane, is explored. Long-term (22 days) localized NO release is achieved by utilizing a cross-linked silicone rubber as topcoats, which can greatly reduce the amount of SNAP, NAP, and NAP disulfide leaching from the SNAP-doped CarboSil films, as measured by LC\u2212MS. Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction characterization of SNAPdoped CarboSil films demonstrate that a polymer\u2212crystal composite is formed during the solvent evaporation process when SNAP exceeds its solubility in CarboSil (ca. 3.4\u22124.0 wt %). Further, when exceeding this solubility threshold, SNAP exists in an orthorhombic crystal form within the bulk of the polymer. The proposed mechanism of sustained NO release in SNAP-doped CarboSil is that the solubilized SNAP in the polymer matrix decomposes and releases NO, primarily in the water-rich regions near the polymer/solution interface, and the dissolved SNAP in the bulk polymeric phase becomes unsaturated, resulting in the dissolution of crystalline SNAP within the bulk of the polymer. This is a very slow process that ultimately leads to NO release at the physiological flux levels for >3 weeks. The increased stability of SNAP within CarboSil is attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the SNAP molecules that crystallize. This crystallization also plays a key role in maintaining RSNO stability within the CarboSil polymer for >8 months at 37\u00b0C (88.5% remains). Further, intravascular catheters fabricated with this new material are demonstrated to significantly decrease the formation of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm (a leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections) (in vitro) over a 7 day period, with 5 log units reduction of viable cell count on catheter surfaces. It is also shown that the NO release catheters can greatly reduce thrombus formation on the catheter surfaces during 7 h implantation in rabbit veins, when compared to the control catheters fabricated without SNAP. These results suggest that the SNAP-doped CarboSil system is a very attractive new composite material for creating long-term NO release medical devices with increased stability and biocompatibility.",

            "text": "Blood-contacting biomedical devices ranging from simple catheters to complex extracorporeal life support systems 1 are central for everyday medical care. For example, the use of intravascular catheters, which enables direct vascular access, is crucial for patient diagnosis and treatment. However, despite substantial efforts to better understand blood/surface interactions, complications like pulmonary embolism, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis are still associated with the use of indwelling blood-contacting medical devices. 2 In a clinical setting, a systemic anticoagulation agent, such as heparin, is often given to patients in order to reduce the risk of surface-induced thrombus formation. 3 However, heparin treatment should be conducted with extreme care, as an inadvertent overdose of heparin can lead to hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia. 4 Although heparin preferentially binds to antithrombin (ATIII), preventing fibrin formation and hindering the development of the hemostatic plug, platelet activation and reduced platelet count is inevitable when foreign surfaces are in contact with blood for a prolonged period. Moreover, biofilm-associated infections are a significant cause of morbidity and death. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most prevalent cause of the high incidence of nosocomial bloodstream infections, specifically, biofilm-associated infections on indwelled biomedical devices. 5, 6 S. aureus biofilms form embedded matrixes which resist both antimicrobials and host defense, thus leading to chronic infections. 7 Therefore, new approaches to reduce the possibilities of these complications and to create truly nonthrombogenic and antimicrobial prosthetic surfaces are still needed within the medical community. 2 Nitric oxide (NO), the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, is a gaseous signaling molecule that has been extensively studied over the past two decades for its role in inhibiting platelet activation and adhesion, preventing bacterial growth, reducing smooth cell proliferation, regulating complex biological processes, etc. 8\u221231 The ubiquity and apparent chemical simplicity of NO have made it a promising therapeutic agent. The production of NO can be accomplished through either enzymatic or nonenzymatic pathways. 11, 32 Nitric oxide either can be synthesized enzymatically by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) that catalyze the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline or can be formed nonenzymatically from the reduction of nitrite 11 or nitrosothiols. The flux of NO released from a healthy endothelium lining, which constitutes the inner walls of all blood vessels, has been estimated to be between 0.5 and 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u221210 mol cm \u22122 min \u22121 . 3,10,33,34 Therefore, a potential approach to increase the hemocompatibility of bloodcontacting devices is to develop polymeric materials or coatings with sustained NO release at this physiological flux level. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that surfaces capable of releasing NO at these levels can significantly reduce thrombus formation on the surface of implantable chemical sensors, 35 intravascular catheters, 14, 15 as well as extracorporeal circuits (ECC). 3, 10, 33 Since NO is highly reactive under physiological conditions and has a very short half-life in vivo, 10,36 a wide range of NO donors, such as S-nitrosothiols (RSNO) and N-diazeniumdiolates (NONOate), have been used to prepare NO releasing polymeric matrixes. Such NO donors have been incorporated into various polymers, including polyethylene glycol, 37 Pluronic F127 hydrogel, 12 polyurethanes, 38 poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), 9 xerogel, 39 and poly(vinyl chloride), 23 and these materials can provide continuous and localized NO delivery to specific sites of interest. S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), Snitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb), and other endogenous RSNOs are considered NO donors in vivo. However, in recent years, researchers have studied synthetic RSNOs, such as S-nitroso-Nacetylpenicillamine (SNAP). 9,10,18 SNAP is a synthetic tertiary RSNO, and it is more stable than most endogenous primary RSNOs due to the steric hindrance of the sulfur atom. 40, 41 SNAP, like other RSNOs, can decompose and release NO via thermal decomposition, metal ion catalysis (e.g., Cu + ), and photolysis when the light energy corresponds with the SNAP absorption bands at 340 nm and/or 590 nm (see eq 1 for overall reaction). 10,42",

CarboSil 20 80A possesses the innate biocompatibility and biostability of conventional silicone elastomers but has the processing capability and toughness of thermoplastic polycarbonate-urethanes. Therefore, the SNAP/CarboSil system is further examined for its NO releasing properties, and leaching of SNAP as well as concomitant NAP and NAP disulfide (NAP dimers) with time from the polymer phase into the PBS soaking buffer. Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction are utilized to conduct in situ solid-state analysis of the SNAP/CarboSil system to better understand the origin of the high stability and long-term NO release properties of this new composite material. Further, catheters fabricated with SNAP-doped CarboSil polymer are evaluated for their efficacy in reducing microbial biofilm formation after 7 days of exposure to flowing media containing S. aureus, the common bacteria that causes intravascular infections within a drip-flow bioreactor. Finally, these NO release catheters are also investigated for their potential as antithrombotic devices via 7 h implantation within the veins of rabbits.",

Three biomedical grade polymers (CarboSil, E5-325, and SR) with low water uptake (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information) were chosen as matrixes for incorporating SNAP. Ten wt % SNAP-doped polymer films were prepared to evaluate their shelf life during dry storage. To simulate the actual storage and/or shipping environments, the SNAP-doped SR, E5-325, and CarboSil films were stored in the dark with desiccant at 37\u00b0C over a period of 8 months. The amount of SNAP remaining in different polymer films was determined at various time points to find the best polymer matrix for maintaining SNAP functionality during storage. The SNAP remaining in the film was decomposed through both the Cu(I) mediated catalytic decomposition pathway and the photoinitiated decomposition pathway by the broad-spectrum 100 W halogen light source. The corresponding NO release measured by the NOA was integrated to determine the total amount of SNAP present in the polymer. The results indicate that SNAP is the most stable in the CarboSil polymer matrix, with 88.5 \u00b1 4.3% of the initial SNAP remaining after 8 months, compared to 86.8 \u00b1 4.9% in SR and 68.3 \u00b1 3.2% in E5-325 (see Figure 1 ).

When SNAP films are in contact with the soaking solutions, water starts to diffuse into the polymer outer surface; SNAP begins to leach into the soaking buffer; and at the same time, SNAP (both from the PBS buffer and within the polymer) starts to release NO and form the NAP disulfide byproduct. The detection of NAP thiolate ion in the soaking solutions can be from two possible sources. It is known that, for solid RSNO samples, contamination of thiols is likely and such thiols can react with the trace amount of Cu(II) in solution and form Cu(I) (eq 2).

For each type of film, the rate of SNAP leaching is the fastest in the first few hours, and then significantly lower amounts of SNAP continue to diffuse into the PBS over sequential days. The SR topcoat, which is a crosslinked polymer, can reduce the amount of SNAP diffusion into the soaking solution better than the non-cross-linked CarboSil topcoat. Similar leaching patterns are observed for the NAP and NAP disulfide species from the films with different topcoats (Figure 2b,c) . NAP is a widely used chelating and detoxifying agent for treatment of heavy metal poisoning (e.g., mercury, cadmium, and arsenic, etc.). 49\u221254 Indeed, it hastens the excretion of poisons out of human body without inducing toxic effects, and it represents a protective measure against free radical induced organ injury. 53 Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that small amounts NAP and/or the dimer of NAP (NAP disulfide) emitted from the polymer into the contacting buffer or blood would not likely cause any toxic response in clinical applications. 10 The 10 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil film with SR topcoats releases NO above 0.5 \u00d7 10 \u221210 mol cm \u22122 min \u22121 , the lower end of endothelial NO flux levels, for more than 3 weeks under physiological conditions (see Figure 3a) .

The cumulative amount of SNAP that releases NO was calculated based on the NOA measurements and compared to the initial amount doped within the film. The total NO release from polymer films can originate from the SNAP decomposing and releasing NO inside the polymer phase as well as from SNAP molecules that diffuse out of the polymer into the PBS buffer. Assuming that the NAP and NAP disulfide detected in the buffer are reaction products of the original SNAP leached from the polymer, the total amount of SNAP that leaches out after time t should be",

Therefore, the total NO release ([NO] total ) from the polymer film is [NO] total = [NO] NOA + [SNAP] total , which was compared with the initial SNAP in the CarboSil film. As shown in Figure 3b , the total moles of SNAP ([SNAP] total ) leached out over 22 days, the time period of the leaching experiment, is approximately 38.5% of the total NO released ([NO] total ) and, therefore, more than 60% of the total NO is, in fact, released from the polymer phase. This suggests that the leaching process is much slower than the rate of NO release from the polymers, so it is likely that, after the first day, NO release from within the polymer (primarily in the water-rich regions near the outer surfaces of the polymers) is the primary source of NO emission. The ability of the SNAP/CarboSil polymer system to deliver localized NO continuously and sufficiently to sites of interest makes it a very promising material for biomedical applications.",

It has been suggested that, in orthorhombic SNAP, one SNAP molecule can form 4 intermolecular hydrogen bonds with 4 surrounding SNAP molecules ( Figure S6 ). 55 The PXRD results of SNAP-doped CarboSil films (1\u221215 wt %) indicate that the characteristic film diffraction patterns are convolutions of blank Carbosil and the crystalline SNAP powder patterns (see Figure  4 ). The results also suggest that, as the amount of doped SNAP increases (for films with greater than 4 wt % SNAP), the intensity of orthorhombic SNAP peaks in the obtained PXRD pattern is enhanced, indicating a greater percentage of crystalline SNAP within the polymer films. However, SNAP peaks could barely be detected in PXRD patterns for samples with <4 wt % doped SNAP, indicating an apparent threshold for formation of the crystalline form of SNAP within CarboSil. Since all SNAP-doped CarboSil films (including those with <4 wt %) have a light green color, it is speculated that SNAP partially dissolves in the polymer, forming a polymer solution, and any excess SNAP beyond the polymer solubility limit crystallizes in the orthorhombic form during the THF evaporation and embeds in the polymer. This explanation is in agreement with the Raman spectroscopy and PXRD results that orthorhombic SNAP crystals are detected only when the SNAP concentration exceeds the solubility of SNAP in the CarboSil polymer. To calculate the SNAP solubility in the CarboSil polymer, a linear least-squares regression was conducted (see the Supporting Information) using three main PXRD peaks. The calculated solubility is 3.6, 3.5, and 3.9 wt %, respectively (see Figure S7 ), indicating that the solubility of SNAP in CarboSil was ca. 3.4\u22124.0 wt %.",

We compared the PXRD patterns of freshly prepared 5 and 15 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil samples as well as the samples stored under ambient light at room temperature for 10 days under the same conditions. We hypothesize that the solubilized SNAP behaves as a solute, dissolving in the CarboSil polymer that acts as the solvent, and it is less stable at room temperature and decomposes faster than the crystalline SNAP. As the solubilized SNAP in the polymer decomposes and the SNAP in the polymer is under saturation, the crystalline SNAP is driven to gradually dissolve into the CarboSil polymer. For 5 wt % fresh samples, most of the SNAP added during preparation is dissolved in the polymer, which is labile and more likely to decompose via thermal decomposition. However, for the 15 wt % SNAP films, most of the SNAP in the film (ca. 11\u221212 wt %) is stabilized by the intermolecular hydrogen bonding. 55 The percentage of SNAP remaining in the 5 and 15 wt % films after 10 days under ambient light is 19.8 and 83.2 wt % of the initial amount, respectively. The attenuation of orthorhombic SNAP peaks in 5 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil films relative to the fresh samples is indeed much greater than that of the 15 wt % samples (see Figure S8 ) where the SNAP peak changes are almost undetectable, thus validating our hypothesis.",

In addition, as a tertiary nitrosothiol, the SNAP molecule itself is more stable with respect to the loss of NO than other primary and secondary RSNOs due to the steric hindrance effect imposed by the gem methyl group on the dimerization of the radicals that leads to the formation of the sulfur bridge 10, 40, 41, 45 and the hindered rotation of the R\ue0d5S\u2212N\ue0d5O linkage at room temperature. 55 The literature also suggests that the acetamide group in SNAP plays a key role in increasing the S\u2212NO bond strength and reducing the NO liability. 46 Moreover, it has also been reported that the viscosity of the polymer imposes an important cage effect on the S\u2212NO bond cleavage and radical pair formation. Specifically, the restricted mobility of soluble SNAP molecules in the CarboSil microenvironment may favor the recombination of the primary radicals rather than radicals escaping from the solvent cage. 10, 12, 37 Therefore, doping SNAP into the polymer represents a viable option for storage and handling for long-term NO release applications. Further studies comparing SNAP solubility in different polymer matrixes and examining the relationship between the SNAP crystallization/ dissolution process and the stability of SNAP in certain polymers could be quite useful in designing additional NO release polymers with enhanced stability and long-term shelf life.",

Owing to the very slow loss of SNAP from the catheter reservoir (given the composite nature of the material), the dose of SNAP leached from the catheters is significantly below the threshold that can induce the adverse reactions. 10 After 7 h of implantation, the catheters were carefully removed from the rabbit veins, leaving the thrombus formation intact on the surface. To determine whether the NO release reduced the clotting on the catheter surface, digital images of the catheter surfaces were taken, and the two-dimensional (2D) representation of the thrombus area was quantitated using ImageJ software from the NIH. As shown in Figure 7 , the thrombus formation is significantly reduced for the SNAP/ CarboSil catheters with NO release ability when compared to the controls (n = 3 rabbit experiments).

            "text": "In this study, we have shown that SNAP doped into the CarboSil 20 80A polymer forms a polymer\u2212crystal composite during solvent evaporation and can locally release NO over a 22 day period via thermal decomposition. Utilizing a cross-linked silicone rubber topcoat can greatly reduce the amount of SNAP, NAP, and NAP disulfide leaching as measured by LC\u2212 MS. The 10 wt % SNAP/CarboSil has excellent stability during the 8 month shelf life study at 37\u00b0C as well as during ethylene oxide sterilization, where 88.5% and 91.8% of the initial SNAP remain in the polymer, respectively. These data suggest the practicality of sterilizing, storing, and shipping biomedical devices made with or coated with this material. Raman spectroscopy and PXRD characterization of SNAP-doped CarboSil films demonstrate that the solubility of SNAP in CarboSil is ca. 3.4\u22124.0 wt %. However, when the SNAP doping wt % is higher than this solubility threshold, SNAP exists in an orthorhombic crystal form within the bulk of the polymer, in which intermolecular hydrogen bonds between SNAP molecules play a key role in maintaining the RSNO stability and functionality over a long period of time. Solubilized SNAP in the polymer phase behaves like a solute in the solid solution polymer system and is less stable and decomposes faster than the crystalline SNAP. When the solubilized SNAP in polymer decomposes/releases NO and the SNAP within the polymer phase is under saturation, the crystalline SNAP in the bulk of the polymer is driven to gradually dissolve into the polymer and further release NO. The NO release process ceases after 22 days when all the SNAP crystals are depleted. The catheters fabricated with this SNAP composite are shown to exhibit significant antibiofilm properties against S. aureus, and such catheters could eventually be used to reduce the rate of nosocomial catheter related bloodstream infections. The SNAP/CarboSil catheters also greatly reduce thrombus formation during 7 h implantation within the veins of rabbits when compared to the corresponding control catheters. Given its excellent stability and long-term NO release capability, the new SNAP-doped CarboSil composite system offers many new opportunities to improve the biocompatibility of biomedical devices for many applications.
