The M protein plays an important role in the assembly process of viral nucleocapsid and membrane. The M glycoprotein can neutralize anti-M antibody in the present of complement and stimulate the production of interferon (Laude et al. 1992) . The M protein is abundant among the structural proteins of PEDV. In addition, the nucleotide sequence of the M gene possess low homology (approx. 50%) with other coronaviruses, but is highly conserved among different PEDV strains (Kim and Chae 2000) . Therefore, the M protein may be used as a candidate diagnostic reagent for determining PEDV infection.",

Effective diagnostic methods are required for surveillance of PED. The first purpose of the current study was to express PEDV-M gene. The expression of coronavirus M protein is difficult due to its sprout function. The viral M protein may cause damage to cell wall resulting in the growth inhibition (Kopecky and Lyles 2003) . PEDV-M protein has been expressed in eukaryotic cells and a baculovirus system (Utiger et al. 1995) . However, low expression and high costs may affect the application of the expressed protein. In contrast, the prokaryotic system is a time-and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production. Selection of a suitable prokaryotic system is important for foreign gene expression (Yin et al. 2007) . We have already expressed several heterologous proteins, including glycoproteins, in prokaryotic systems and the bacterially-expressed proteins display excellent biological activities (Liu et al. 2009; Ren et al. 2010a, b) .",

In this study, we expressed full-length PEDV-M gene using a similar expression system. Availability of the mature M protein may allow us to identify more antigenic epitopes in this protein and make more functional analysis in the future. The M protein of PEDV has been identified by use of rabbit anti-peptide sera and transient expression of the M gene in Vero cells and by expression in the baculovirus system. The native M protein of PEDV is incorporated into virions, is N-glycosylated and with a molecular size of 27 kDa. In contrast, the (Utiger et al. 1995) . In this study, the bacterially-expressed M protein is excluded from glycosylation and also migrates with an Mr of approx. 23 kDa (excluding the His-tag in the N-terminus). However, amount of the protein is enough for functional analysis and related experiments. The M protein was inoculated into rabbits to generate antibody. At different immunization intervals, we found that the titer of the anti-M antibody increased slowly, therefore, we had to prolong the immunization period (up to 3 months) to achieve a higher antibody titer. In our study, the sera collected from two immunized rabbits gave the similar antibody titer. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays showed that the antibody recognized the M protein and the virus-infected cells, indicating that the polyclonal antibody can be used for detection of PEDV.",

They caused similar clinical signs and histological intestinal lesions, such as severe villus atrophy in the proximal and distal jejunum as well as in the ileum (Kim and Chae 2000) . Herein porcine coronaviruses (TGEV and PEDV), avian coronavirus (IBV), porcine arterivirus (PRRSV), porcine pestivirus (CSFV) and porcine herpesvirus (PrV) were used as coating antigens in an indirect ELISA. The viruses have been confirmed by ELISA or PCR (data not shown). The results showed that the anti-M polyclonal antibody was specific to PEDV. These selected viruses are common pathogens in China and some of which may cause mixed infection with PEDV. The established ELISA described in this paper is valuable for differentiating infection between PEDV and other related viruses.",
