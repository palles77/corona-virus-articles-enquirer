National Health Insurance Research Datasets in Taiwan from 2002 to 2005 has been used for the study. The study compared the differences of TB default rate before and after the implementation of P4P program, between participating and non-participating hospitals, and between P4P hospitals with and without case managers. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the related factors influencing TB patients default treatment after TB detected. Results: The treatment default rate after \"P4P on TB\" was 11.37% compared with the 15.56% before \"P4P on TB\" implementation. The treatment default rate in P4P hospitals was 10.67% compared to 12.7% in non-P4P hospitals. In addition, the default rate was 10.4% in hospitals with case managers compared with 12.68% in hospitals without case managers.",

The BNHI set the objectives of pay-forperformance demonstration programs for TB to include: 1) improving the case management model; 2) decreasing the death rate from tuberculosis; 3) increasing the cure rate of tuberculosis; 4) improving the payment system to encourage health care providers to provide high quality treatment, and give them more responsibilities.",

The incentives can be to patients or to providers. For patients, most countries provide food or other living supports as incentives to encourage patients. In Russian, some cities provided food, travel support or clothing to patients if they did not interrupt treatment. The default rates dropped from 15e20% to 2e6%. In Tajikistan, vulnerable patients were given food, conditional on their adherence to treatment. The treatment success rate was 89.5% compared to 59.4% in non-incentive patients. 8 From the provider incentive side, several countries also showed positive results. In China, providers would receive financial payment or monetary incentives when diagnosis or treatments have been completed. However, no related results are showed. Bangladesh provided travel, food and doctor handbag to TB treatment doctors, and the cure rate increased significantly to 88%. 9 The first study which examined the effectiveness of pay-for-performance demonstration project on TB in Taiwan was conducted in 2003. 10 The results suggested that the project can shorten the period of tuberculosis treatment for the patients cured. Same group 11 did further study and indicated that TB cure rate and length of treatment for cured cases improved significantly after P4P on TB implemented.

Patients living in the cities with the highest income level had the highest default rates (12.13%), followed by cities with the lowest income levels (10.43%) and cities with median levels of income (9.75%) ( Table 3) . Table 4 reports the results of the logistic regression model with treatment interruption probability for TB patients as the dependent variable. The independent variables included in the model are gender, age, migration status, hospital participating in P4P program, hospital with/ without case managers, comorbidity level, levels of city income, and physician resources. Note from the parameters estimated (Table 4 ) that the probability of default is lower for female compared to male patients (OR Z 0.878). Patients migrating to other cities were more likely to interrupt their treatment than patients not migrating during the treatment phase (OR Z 9.829). As expected, patients with more serious comorbidity status are more likely to interrupt from treatment than patients with no comorbidity. Patients with mild comorbidity level (CCI Z 1) had around 1.6 times more likely to default from treatment while patients with severe comorbidity level (CCI S 2) had around 2 times more likely to default compared to patients with no comorbidity. Patients in P4P hospitals were less likely to default than patients in non-P4P hospitals (OR Z 0.904), and patients in hospitals with case manager were less likely to default than patients in hospitals without case manager (OR Z 0.831). A number of city characteristics also influenced the default rate. Patients living in cities with median level of income were less likely to default from treatment than patients living in cities with high income level (OR Z 0.881). Patients in cities with median level of physician resources were less likely to default than patients living in cities with high income levels (OR Z 0.757) (see Table 4 ). After \"P4P on TB\" program was implemented, the study found total 3085 patients with 6022 times of default from treatment. There was 15.84% (N Z 954) of the defaults within the first 3 months of treatment, and 30.78% (N Z 1854) defaulted between the fourth and sixth month of treatment, and 29.26% (N Z 1762) defaulted between the seventh and ninth month of treatment, and 24.12% (N Z 1452) defaulted after the tenth month of treatment. The number of default cases dramatically increased from the first month to the 3rd month of treatment, and peaked at the 5th month from the start of treatment (Fig. 1) . After the 5th month, the trend of number of default cases decreased slightly. Furthermore, the study analyzed the relationship between time from start of treatment to default and patients' medication days per medical visits. Patients receiving medication days between 15 to 28 days had the highest default rate which was 35.77%, following by the patients receiving medication days less than 7 days (24.48%).",

For poor patients, food or traveling support may be needed. For nonpoor patients, some extra monetary incentives may encourage patients' compliance and decrease the default rate. From this study, male had lower compliance (higher default rate) than women. Some previous studies had same conclusions. 3,10,21e23 Previous study found that once the symptoms were gone, men and the elderly were easily defaulted from treatment. 2 Men and elderly do not understand the importance of compliance and completing the full treatment.

As our studies' results, at the 5th month from start of treatment was the month with the highest default rate. The study from Singapore had similar findings in year 2000. 37 Many studies concluded that higher compliance of TB treatment could be attributed to the presence of disease symptoms, because compliance is usually lower with treatment for asymptomatic conditions. 38, 39 For the treatment of tuberculosis, the disease symptoms were usually resolved within the first 3 months of treatment. Thus patients may discontinue the treatment when they feel markedly better after the first 3 months of treatment. 28, 40 This underscores the importance of TB patients' education on the need to complete the full course of treatment so as to prevent subsequent relapse. In addition, the ultimate responsibility for this can only lie on the treating physicians and case managers, whose role was not only to treat disease, but also to ensure that the patients adhere to and complete the treatment. Previous study suggested that reminding patients by clinics or hospitals are required to ensure the rate of complete treatment. 41 Telephone reminders, use of incentives are effective methods.",
