However, the S/D method of pathogen inactivation was patented in 1985 for the treatment of concentrates of coagulation factors [1] . Since then it has become the most widely spread industrial method for the virucidal treatment of plasmaderived medicinal products. The composition of plasma, unlike clotting factor concentrates, is extremely complex and [5] , between 1986 and 1989, Bernard Horowitz implemented a modified S/D method adapted to its higher lipid content and able to ensure an effective virucidal power [6] . In 1992, the first studies describing the characteristics of inactivated plasma and the S/D industrial inactivation process were published and it was licensed [7, 8] . However, in 1998, the robustness of this method was finally confirmed by the validation study of viral safety by Biesert and Shartono [9] . It was first introduced into clinical practice in Germany, based on observational studies demonstrating safety and efficacy [10] .",

Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is thawed rapidly and treated for 4 h with TNBP solvent and with Triton X-100 detergent, both at 1 %. The TNBP is then removed by extraction with castor (or soybean) oil and the Triton X-100 by hydrophobic chromatography. These processes are followed by sterile filtration with a 0.2-lm filter and aseptic packaging into the final product (frozen units of 200 mL or lyophilized units in glass bottles of 50 or 200 mL) [6] . According to the European Pharmacopoeia the allowed residual amounts of these substances in the final S/D-treated product are less than 2 lg/mL for TNBP and less than 5 lg/mL for Triton X-100 [11] ; these figures are much lower than the toxicity levels for either substance or ambient environmental exposures in developed countries and, actually, the levels of these additives in most S/D plasma batches are below the detectability threshold that is 0.5 and 1 lg/mL, respectively [6, 12] . In addition, the general safety tests performed on rodents indicate that the S/D processing of plasma do not generate toxicity and do not have mutagenicity, embryo toxic, or teratogenic potential. A thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) patient could theoretically receive 63 L of S/D plasma or 2.7 mg/kg of Triton X-100, which is still well below the toxicity levels of this chemical compound.",

ROS have a key role in the damage of red blood cells and recently fostered an approach to improving the quality and efficacy of stored red cells focused on reducing oxidative damage by removing oxygen at the beginning of storage and maintaining the anaerobic state throughout the storage period [30] . Very recently Feys et al. [31] revealed the mechanism of damage to plasma constituents by riboflavin and light and showed that generated ROS played a direct role in adversely affecting the biomolecular integrity of relevant plasma constituents such as ADAMTS13, factor VIII and fibrinogen. In this case, plasma product integrity could be maintained by applying hypoxic conditions during the pathogen inactivation process. It is important to note that the formation of singlet oxygen upon illumination is part of the mechanism of action also of the methylene blue (MB) pathogen reduction system [32] whose efficacy is indeed increased in the presence of oxygen [12] .",

The hyperfibrinolysis, which was initially attributed to reduced levels of a 2 -antiplasmin in S/D FFP, was subsequently correlated to the amount of bleeding. Following modifications of the surgical technique and the introduction of low doses of aprotinin no further thrombotic or haemorrhagic complications occurred [36] . In Norway 208 liver transplants were carried out between 1993 and 2001 using S/D FFP and aprotinin, with no reports of thrombotic or haemorrhagic complications [36] . Furthermore, there have been no descriptions of persistent bleeding in patients with congenital or acquired deficiency of plasmin inhibitor treated with S/D plasma-based replacement therapy [22, 37] . Therefore, clinical studies did not confirm the initial concerns due to the low levels of a 2 -antiplasmin or antitrypsin activity in S/D plasma [6, 22] .",

SD underwent concentration and ultrafiltration passages not used in the European product. Therefore, the North American plasma showed a greater decrease in the activities of antitrypsin, plasmin inhibitor activity, and plasmin activator inhibitor, contained residues of TNBP, and had high concentrations of lipoprotein (a), fibrin monomers and C3a des-Arg, a complement activation marker. Moreover, the American product had almost no PS activity, whereas European S/D plasma has a moderate reduction of PS activity and antigen [6, 17, 22, 40, 41] .",

More recently, Santagostino and colleagues reported on 17 patients with recessively inherited coagulation disorders (1 afibrinogenemia, 4 factor V, 6 combined FV and FVIII, 1 factor X, and 5 factor XI deficiencies) [61] . In 13/16 cases (81 %) S/D plasma was fully effective, while in the remaining three cases it was partially effective as the post-surgical mild bleeding was controlled by continuing or increasing treatment with S/D plasma. As was the case in recent studies [62, 63] and also recommended by international guidelines on the appropriate usage of noninactivated FFP [64] [65] [66] , this article clearly shows that also the dosages of S/D plasma to be used to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment are greater than the traditional ones of 10-15 mL per kilogram and frequently are approximately 30 mL per kilogram.",

No differences between S/D plasma and FFP were seen with regard to the mean dose of plasma infused, percentage of patients with corrected PT to B15 s (32 % for S/D plasma vs 26 for FFP, p = 0.67) or percentage of patients whose bleeding stopped (27 % for S/D plasma vs 22 % for FFP). Clinical response to plasma therapy was similar between the groups. Similar results were found in another randomized [69] . Forty-nine patients with liver disease or undergoing liver transplantation were randomly assigned to receive FFP or S/D plasma prior to procedure (liver biopsy or transplantation) or for severe coagulopathy. The dose of plasma infused was similar between the groups. Results showed that correction of clotting factor levels and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was equal with FFP and S/D plasma. The greater decrease in the International Normalized ratio (INR) seen in the S/D plasma group was attributed by the authors to the higher baseline INR of those patients compared to those in the FFP group. Notably, use of S/D plasma in patients undergoing liver transplantation did not increase the need for other blood components. Two randomized trials analysed the use of S/D plasma in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). In the first study, by Freeman and colleagues [73] , 28 patients with coagulopathy following OLT showed equal correction with S/D plasma or FFP. In the second, more recent, study conducted by Bindi and colleagues on 63 OLT patients [74] , the use of S/D plasma in association with the monitoring of haemostasis by means of thromboelastography gave the same therapeutic results as FFP but with a significant reduction in the amount of plasma transfused (2,617 \u00b1 1,297 mL in the FFP group vs 1,187 \u00b1 560.6 mL in the S/D plasma group, p \\ 0.0001).",

On the other hand, significant differences between these products were found for levels of total PS and plasmin inhibitor. However, clinical haemostasis evaluation revealed no significant difference between the two treatment regimens. These results were in agreement with the previous findings from a randomized clinical trial conducted by Wieding et al. [77] comparing S/D plasma and MB light virus-inactivated plasma in 71 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. A prospective randomized study by Tollofrsud et al. [78] also reported positive experience on the use of S/D plasma in open-heart surgery. Finally, on the basis of the finding that S/D plasma lacks the highest molecular weight vWF multimers [56] , which have been involved in the pathogenesis of TTP, some investigators have assessed S/D plasma in the treatment of patients with acute TTP with reported rates of remission between 90 and 100 % [43, [79] [80] [81] [82] . Furthermore, these studies documented that S/D plasma dramatically reduces [81] or even eliminates [80] allergic reactions. ",

Indeed, haemovigilance national programs clearly demonstrate the safety of S/D plasma in all clinical settings [6] . Clinical experience from France, after the transfusion of more than 1.9 million units of S/D plasma since 1994, and from Finland, after more than 150,000 units since 2005, show a significant reduction in the rate of serious adverse events (approximately 85 %) as compared with standard FFP [83, 84] . Since 1993, in Norway, more than 250,000 units of S/D plasma have been successfully transfused to all categories of patients, including neonates and liver transplant patients, with no cases of transmission of viral diseases, thrombotic complications or TRALI [27, 28] . Similar findings emerged in a Belgian retrospective analysis of 5,064 S/D plasma units transfused in 894 recipients [85] . In the UK more than 350,000 units of S/D plasma have been transfused after the introduction of the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) haemovigilance system without reports of serious problems [86] . Supporting data was also provided by the Austrian haemovigilance registry, which, in 2004, reported 19 allergic reactions after FFP and only 1 after S/D plasma [87] , and by the Italian haemovigilance registry, which reported a significantly lower rate of adverse reactions to S/D plasma compared with non-pharmaceutical FFP [adverse reactions/units 9 1000: 0.06 with PlasmaSafe (Kedrion SpA, Castelvecchio Pascoli, Lucca, Italy) vs 0.48 with FFP, p \\ 0.01] following the transfusion of over 250,000 units from 2009 to 2011 [88] .",

Another two studies assessed the costeffectiveness of S/D plasma [90, 91] . All three studies yielded a wide range of cost/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimates ($ 289,300 [89] , $ 2,156,000 [90] , and $9,743,000 [91] ) and concluded that the increased level of safety of S/D plasma did not justify its considerable additional cost.",
