[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The management of patients with MERS-CoV infection consists of a combination of supportive measures, antimicrobial therapy for any associated bacterial or viral infections, and strict implementation of appropriate infection control precautions. 7 So far, no antiviral therapy has been approved for the treatment of patients with MERS-CoV infection. 8 Several therapeutic interventions for coronavirus were investigated during the large multinational outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. 9, 10 Reviews of the available scientifi c literature suggest that a combination of ribavirin and interferon might be of benefi t in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection. 8, 11, 12 Furthermore, this combination was shown to inhibit MERS-CoV in cell culture and seemed to improve outcomes in an animal study. 13, 14 Both agents are associated with substantial potential adverse eff ects and hence their clinical use should be carefully balanced against any potential harm. 8 We aimed to assess outcomes of a treatment programme for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection that consisted of oral ribavirin and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a. We report the results and outcomes in patients given treatment in accordance with this protocol by comparison with a historical group who received supportive therapy only.",

The loss of a signifi cant survival diff erence over time might be partly explained by most patients in our cohort having several comorbidities with high APACHE II and SOFA scores. Mortality is known to be very high in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection who need critical-care support. 24 Therefore, long-term survival benefi t, if present, might be diffi cult to show in smaller studies. Treatment with ribavirin and interferon was well tolerated in our study. The only adverse event that was signifi cantly worse in the treatment group was mean decrease in haemoglobin (4.32 g/L in the treatment group compared with 2\u00b714 g/L in the comparator group). Anaemia is a well recognised complication of ribavirin therapy and was noted previously in studies investigating the role of ribavirin in the treatment of SARS coronavirus infection. 25, 26 Of note, receipt of packed red blood cells was not signifi cantly diff erent between the treatment and comparator groups in our study. Furthermore, no treatment discontinuations occurred as a result of anaemia. Therefore, the risk of ribavirin-associated anaemia-although substantial and in need of careful monitoring-might not hinder the use of ribavirin for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, especially if a survival benefi t can be confi rmed. Baseline absolute neutrophil count was signifi cantly lower in the treatment group and therefore a signifi cantly lower minimal absolute neutrophil count during the course of the illness is not surprising.",

Our study, albeit small, is the largest clinical investigation so far to assess the use of this combination in the treatment of patients with severe MERS-CoV infection.

Undoubtedly, new interventions should ideally be assessed in randomised, controlled clinical trials. However, such an approach is generally accepted to not always be practically feasible in the context of an emerging and relatively uncommon disease such as MERS-CoV infection. 8 We carefully selected our comparator group, ensuring that the two cohorts were matched as closely as possible in their clinical characteristics and treatment interventions other than the receipt of ribavirin and interferon. We removed three individuals who had outlying baseline serum creatinine from the comparator group to minimise the risk of any spurious conclusions driven by clinical characteristics that might be potentially detrimental to clinical outcome. Clinical outcomes for each individual were masked from investigators who selected patients and did matching assessments. The absence of serial viral load measurement in lower respiratory tract samples in our study makes it impossible to show any association between temporal viral load changes and antiviral therapy. Such measurements should be included in any future clinical studies exploring the therapeutic benefi t of any antiviral intervention for patients with MERS-CoV infection. Severe MERS-CoV is associated with poor overall survival. Treatment with oral ribavirin and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a is associated with signifi cantly improved survival at 14 days, but not at 28 days. The combination is associated with signifi cant falls in haemoglobin, but no other signifi cant adverse eff ects were noted. Treatment with ribavirin and pegylated interferon might be considered in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, provided that adequate monitoring and assessment can be ensured. Further assessment, including in patients with less severe MERS-CoV infection, in appropriately designed randomised trials, is recommended.",
