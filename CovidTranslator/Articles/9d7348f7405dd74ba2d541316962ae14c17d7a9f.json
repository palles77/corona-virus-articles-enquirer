By their reactivity in competition binding assays with biotinylated MAbs, anti-S MAbs fell into four competitive binding groups, A, B, C, and D, and between individual members of each group the competition was generally strong and reciprocal. An epitope map showing the main antigenic domains delineated on the BCV peplomeric S glycoprotein was deduced from the competition binding experiments and is illustrated in Fig. 2 . Epitopes associated with the neutralizing activity are located on sites A, B, and C. Antigenic domains A and B appeared to be associated with a strong neutralizing activity and were recognized by MAbs BCF 4, BCB 1, and BCH 5, b Percentage competition: + + + + > 75%, + + 25 to 75%, -< 25% and if it occurred over fewer than three ten-fold dilutions. By definition, binding of each conjugate to viral antigen in the absence of competitor represents 100% binding (0% competition), while the binding of the conjugate following prior incubation with excess of the same unlabeled MAb represents 0% binding (100% competition) [11] . and MAbs BCB 5 and BCA 3, respectively. The anti-S MAbs having a weak neutralizing activity (BCA 2, BCH 8) or devoid of neutralizing activity (BCA 1 and BCH 3) defined antigenic domain C. The anti-S reactivity of MAbs BCA 7 could not be blocked by the other MAbs and for this reason it was suggested to be directed against a distinct non-neutralizing antigenic domain. Furthermore, antibodies BCA 1 and BCH 3, and BCH 5, which were assigned to antigenic domains C and A, showed reciprocal competition with monoclonal BCA 3 assigned to antigenic domain B. This suggests the presence of overlapping regions among major antigenic domains of the S glycoprotein that are involved in the neutralizing activity. The BCV anti-S MAbs were tested for their cross-reactivity with other hemagglutinating coronaviruses and were applied to analyse bovine coronaviruses isolated from dairy cattle in Quebec. In preliminary experiments using polyclonal rabbit antisera, the relationship among HCV-OC 43, HEV, TCV, and BCV was confirmed by IIF and Western immunoblotting; by HAI and neutralization assays, only TCV and BCV appeared to be serologically related [8] . Furthermore, using polyctonal antisera, there was no evidence from this study to warrant distinction of the various Quebec BCV isolates into classical serotypes (data not shown).",

            "text": "The cross-reactivity of BCV anti-S MAbs was tested in an indirect ELISA [7] . Twice the amount of MAb giving maximal binding to the Mebus strain of BCV was used for antigenic comparison. As illustrated in Fig. 3 , binding to the heterologous virus strains was expressed as a percentage of the absorbance values obtained with the reference virus. Overall, at least three antigenic groups could be recognized among the BCV isolates studied. Two Quebec isolates of BCV (BCQ4 and BCQ 718) reacted similarly to the Mebus strain with the 12 MAbs tested. The MAbs BCH 6, BCH 1, and BCA 7 did not show significant variability among the various Quebec BCV isolates, and bound intensively to the three other hemagglutinating coronaviruses tested. The MAbs BCB 1, BCF4, BCB 5, and BCA 3 reacted with a very low intensity against eight of the Quebec isolates. Among the latter, six reacted strongly with the other MAbs. The BCV isolates BCQ9, BCQ12, and BCQ2070, and HEV exhibited no reactivity to the four previous MAbs and to MAbs BCH 3, BCA 1, BCH 8, and BCA 2. Four of the anti-BCV MAbs (BCH 5, BCB 1, BCF 4, and BCH 3) did not react against HCV-OC 43. The Minnesota strain of TCV reacted strongly with most of the anti-BCV MAbs; this virus appeared to differ from the reference BCV strain only by its lower reactivity to MAbs BCH 3, BCH 8, and BCA 2 (50% of the value obtained with the homologous virus).",

            "text": "In the present study, data obtained in the competition binding experiments with BCV anti-S MAbs were in agreement with previous findings reported in cases of an avirulent (BCQ 2) and a virulent (Gl10) BCV strain [11, 26] . However, a more extensive MAb library is required to establish more definitive spacial and operational mapping of the antigenic determinants carried by the S glycoprotein of the BCV virion. Vautherot etal. [27] have identified a total of seven antigenic domains for the S glycoprotein of BCV by means of a competitive binding assay; four independent antigenic domains were found to be located on S 1, two on S 2, and one on gp 200. As demonstrated in the present study, most of the neutralizing-mediating determinants appeared to cluster in two major antigenic domains of the S 1 subunit, A and B, the latter being subdivised into subsites [27] . Recently, BCV anti-S MAbs BCB 5, BCA3, BCF4, and BCB 1 that possess a strong neutralizing activity were found to react against the spike glycoprotein S 1 subunit, expressed by recombinant baculovirus [29; Parker M.D., pets. comm.]. Comparison of Quebec enteropathogenic BCV isolates using polyclonal antisera and MAbs directed to the S glycoprotein confirmed their close antigenic relationship, but also revealed the occurrence of at least three distinct antigenic subgroups. These subgroups were identified by neutralizing MAbs directed to epitopes of antigenic domains A, B, and C. Antigenic domain D of the S glycoprotein, defined by MAb BCA 7, appeared to be highly conserved among Quebec BCV isolates, as well as a non-neutralizing epitope assigned to antigenic domain A. Three Quebec BCV isolates differed from the other by neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes assigned to antigenic domain C. Another neutralizing MAb (BCH 1), that could not be assigned to the aforementioned antigenic domains, was found to be directed to an epitope highly preserved among the various BCV isolates, as well as the three other hemagglutinating corona~iruses tested. The Minnesota strain of TCV, which could not be differentiated from BCV by virus neutralization tests using polyclonal rabbit or turkey hyperimmune sera [8] , was found to differ from the latter by epitopes of antigenic domain C. These epitopes appeared to be associated with weak neutralizing activity. Epitopes of antigenic domains A and B, associated to a strong neutralizing activity, appeared to be highly conserved among both viruses, thus confirming previous reports on the close antigenic and genomic relationship between the turkey and bovine enteropathogenic coronaviruses [-8, 9, 28] .",

Using polyclonal hyperimmune sera, we were unable to show cross-reactivity by virus neutralization between the human and bovine hemagglutinating coronaviruses, but common epitopes located on their various structural proteins were recognized by Western immunoblotting [14] .

After incubation for 90 rain at 37 \u00b0C, binding to the viral antigen was detected by the addition of peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. The resulting A 450 value was read and used to rate MAbs for avidity Antigenic map of BCV (Mebus strain) peplomeric S glycoprotein deduced from competitive binding assays. A, B, C, and D Four antigenic sites defined by the anti-S (gp 100) monoclonal antibodies. The MAbs defining each site are indicated in the corresponding circle. Antigenic site B is partly related to antigenic sites A and C via common non-neutralizing epitopes (shadowed). The neutralizing MAb BCH 1, an antibody of apparent low avidity, could not be assigned to a particular antigenic group since a reciprocal competition experiment could not be done due to the tack of biotinylated probe. However, the neutralizing epitope defined by this MAb has been found to be conserved among all BCV isolates analysed and for this reason was assigned to another antigenic site. The antigenic sites on the peplomeric glycoprotein of BCV were designated according to the nomenclature used by Deregt et al.[11] and Vautherot et al.[27]",
