Methods: We telephoned all hospitals in the UK listed as having a major ED. We surveyed their ED facilities and procedures for managing patients with infectious diseases. We determined how many of the EDs had an isolation room available and, if present, whether this had an independent ventilation system and separate access from outside the ED. In addition, we determined how many of the EDs would isolate patients with suspected cases of chickenpox, tuberculosis (TB), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and other suspicious infections. Results: We obtained complete data from 203 (79%) of the 257 hospitals approached. Only 49 (24%) of these hospitals had isolation facilities available in the ED. Of these 49 EDs, 30 (61%) reported an independent ventilation system and 18 (37%) reported a separate access from outside the ED. The majority of EDs would isolate patients with potential infectious diseases, however, 47 (23%) would not isolate patients with suspected chickenpox, 37 (18%) EDS would not isolate patients with suspected TB, 12 (6%) EDS would not isolate patients with suspected SARS and 55 (27%) EDS would not isolate patients with other suspicious infections. Conclusion: EDs in the UK are not prepared for emerging biological threats and bioterrorism. With current facilities and procedures it is highly likely that an infectious agent will spread to staff and other patients in any future biological incident.",

Periodic natural outbreaks of new and emerging infectious diseases, such as the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in South East Asia, 1 the possibility of an influenza pandemic, 2e4 and the threat of the terrorist use of biological weapons against civilian populations, 5, 6 have all led to increasing concern among emergency planners and first responders who may not be prepared to respond safely to such incidents. 7e10 Unlike most health services' major incidents, the onset of a biological incident may be insidious, geographically widespread and may demonstrate features unfamiliar to the clinician. It is therefore essential that the emergency departments (EDs) have facilities and procedures in place to manage patients who may present with features associated with a biological agent. It is highly likely that in any future biological incident patients will present with clinical features suggestive of infectious disease prior to the nature of the biological agent being known.",

            "text": "We chose to telephone a senior member of operational nursing staff rather than to formally write to each ED as we felt that this was more likely to reveal the true departmental response. It is possible that some of the EDs reporting no infection control procedures for the management of patients presenting with known infectious diseases do in fact have such procedures; however, if these are not known to the senior nursing staff then they are clearly ineffective. As with all studies of this type we have only been able to assess what people say that they will do rather than what they will do in practice. However, we see no reason why those contacted would deliberately under report their EDs response. While up to three approaches were made to collect data there is no reason to suspect 'survey fatigue' since the answers were sought from the duty sister/charge nurse or duty shift leader in the ED of each hospital rather than from a specific individual. We chose chickenpox (varicella) as a marker of preparedness in light of its infectivity and its potential for confusion with smallpox (variola) early in the course of the disease. 11 In the ED, isolation is the single most important intervention in patients in whom variola infection is suspected. Pulmonary TB was chosen as a marker of preparedness in light of its increasing prevalence and the emergence of multiple drug-resistant TB. National guidelines have been available for some time regarding the management of multiple drug-resistant TB 12 and are currently being reviewed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), 13 although specific guidance about the isolation of patients in the ED has not been included. Specific questions regarding SARS were asked as we sought to determine how recent guidance from the Health Protection Agency for the management of SARS 14 had been implemented in practice. The SARS guidance at the time stated that patients should be managed by appropriately protected staff in an isolation setting with an independent ventilation system and with a separate access from the main ED or Medical Assessment Unit (MAU). Any future influenza pandemic is likely to present in a similar way to SARS and similar precautions are advocated for cases of avian influenza. 15 Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies, discussing particularly any differences in results",
