            "text": "Both adjuvants are generally regarded as safe to use in human vaccines when used in accordance with the current vaccination schedules. 1, 2 A.T. Glenny and coworkers were the first to demonstrate the adjuvant effect of aluminum compounds in 1926. Glenny prepared a variety of diphtheria toxoid precipitates and investigated their immunogenicity. Among these were toxoids precipitated by the addition of potassium alum [KAl(SO 4 ) 2 :12H 2 O]. Glenny observed that injecting the diphtheria toxoid as an alum precipitate led to a significant increase in the immune response against the toxoid. 3, 4 Vaccines prepared in accordance with this principle have been used in practical vaccination and are referred to as alum-precipitated vaccines. This approach, however, has a number of drawbacks. It was found 5 that such preparations could be highly heterogeneous, depending on which anions, such as bicarbonate, sulfate, or phosphate, were present at the time of precipitation, e.g., as buffer constituents or growth media residues in the antigen solution. In addition to this, Al precipitation with the antigen takes place under alkaline conditions, and this may in some cases introduce alterations to the antigen. In contrast, preformed aluminum hydroxide, in the form of hydrated colloid \"gels,\" has the ability to adsorb protein antigens from an aqueous solution and such gels can be preformed in a well-defined and standardized way. 6 Vaccine preparations based on adsorption of the antigen onto a preformed aluminum hydroxide adjuvant are referred to as aluminum-adsorbed vaccines, in contrast to the alum-precipitated vaccines mentioned earlier. Data on the use of alum-precipitated vaccines can be found in the older literature, 7 but in practical vaccination, the adsorption onto preformed aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate gels has now almost completely substituted the alum precipitation in vaccine formulation. Aluminum phosphate was introduced as an alternative adjuvant two decades after Glenny's work. In 1946, Hans Ericsson from Sweden 8 devised a method in which diphtheria toxoid was coprecipitated into a matrix of aluminum phosphate, corresponding to the alum precipitation method described earlier. Lewis B. Holt 9 demonstrated the following year that preformed aluminum phosphate (prepared from aluminum chloride and trisodium phosphate) acted as an adsorbant and was adjuvant-active with diphtheria toxoid. Aluminum hydroxide has been included into composite adjuvant formulations, such as the AS04 adjuvant formulation proprietary to Glaxo SmithKline, which consists of aluminum hydroxide in combination with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL).",

Using X-ray crystallography and infrared spectroscopy they demonstrated a boehmite-like (aluminum oxyhydroxide, AlOOH) pattern in preparations traditionally known as aluminum hydroxide, whereas commercialized aluminum phosphate gel adjuvant was identified as amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate. 12 It was possible to calculate an average primary crystallite size of 4.5 \u00c2 2.2 \u00c2 10 nm for the boehmite preparations. 13 Commercially available calcium phosphate (from REHEIS Inc. NJ, USA) was studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermal analysis. This indicated that calcium phosphate adjuvant with the suggested formula of Ca 3 (PO 4 ) 2 could be described as nonstoichiometric hydroxyapatite, Ca 10\u00c0x (HPO 4 ) x (PO 4 ) 6\u00c0x (OH) 2\u00c0x , where x varies from 0 to 2. 14 In the original work, Relyveld described the calcium phosphate adjuvant, prepared at the Institut Pasteur, as non-hydroxyapatite (Relyveld, personal communication Morphological studies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been performed ( Fig. 18 .2).

Other aluminum-adsorbed vaccines, against, e.g., anthrax, are available for special risk groups (Table 18 .1).

A Th2-biased immune response is not likely to protect against diseases for which Th1 immunity and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ierestricted CTLs are essential for protection, such as with, e.g., intracellular parasites or tuberculosis. 31 Another limitation lies in the fact that traditional aluminumand calcium-adsorbed vaccines are sensitive to freezing and therefore not lyophilizable. Assays for the detection of damages to vaccine formulations induced by freezing have been published. 32, 33 Attempts have been made to overcome the sensitivity to freezing by adding lyoprotectants, such as trehalose, to the preparations. 34, 35 Aluminum adjuvants failed to provide satisfactory augmentation of the immune response against a number of infectious diseases, such as with influenza and typhoid fever vaccines. 36, 37 In some approaches to vaccine preparation, aluminum adjuvants have shown limitations in their applicability in vaccines based on small-sized peptides. 38 In some cases, e.g., with foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus peptides, the problem could be overcome by conjugating the peptide to a larger carrier molecule. 39 In others, it could not. 40, 41 Aluminum adjuvants have been tested in a few DNA vaccine formulations. Here it was shown 42,43 that aluminum hydroxide had an inhibiting effect, whereas aluminum phosphate adjuvant augmented the immune response against the antigen encoded by the DNA nucleotide. The content of phosphate in the DNA molecule apparently gives it a high binding affinity to the aluminum hydroxide, which in turn prevents efficient transcription and translation into protein. 43 ",

It can be done by quantitative immunoelectrophoresis 61 or by single radial immunodiffusion. 62 Without the use of an antibody it can be tested spectrophotometrically, e.g., by the bicinchoninic acid or BCA method. 63 However, one should be aware that contamination with the fine fraction of mineral gel particles can disturb the spectrophotometrical readings by light-scatter effects. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods have been designed 64 in which aluminum-adsorbed antigens could be used directly as antigens in ELISA assays. ELISA methods were also applied for in vitro assessment of various viral antigens, i.e., pseudorabies, porcine parvovirus, and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis vaccines adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. 65 Differential adsorption of complex mixtures of antigens can be measured by either immunoelectrophoresis or by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). If an antiserum raised against the complex antigen mixture is available, a crossed, twodimensional immunoelectrophoresis may reveal if single components from the complex solution of proteins remain unadsorbed. To use this approach, the precipitation band pattern from an electrophoresis run on the complex antigen mixture prior to adsorption is compared with the bands of an electrophoresis run on the supernatant of the same mixture after adsorption. Unadsorbed components will retain their immunoprecipitation band pattern, whereas missing bands or reduced height of bands are indicative of complete or partial protein adsorption. 61 An HPLC chromatogram of the antigen mixture liquid phase before and after adsorption may provide a similar type of information.",

This is due to the complex nature of macromolecule (protein antigen) interactions with surfaces, which are typically rough and inhomogeneous; the equilibria conditions, which might not be achieved at the time of recording; the disparity and multivalent nature of protein-binding sites at their own surface; structure remodeling upon adsorption; proteineprotein interactions at high concentrations; etc. This topic is not discussed further here, and the reader is referred to the work by Latour. 70 When Langmuir isotherms are fitted to \"Langmuir-looking\" data plots, there is often the risk of underevaluating the K eq parameter (and associated free Gibbs energy value) with the potential for drawing erroneous conclusions. 70 In addition, when K eq values are very high and because of the shape of rectangular hyperbola, the dynamic range for data point collection can become compressed, making the effective concentration range very limited and experimentally impractical to handle.",

One can observe a linear increase of the bound fraction at low concentrations of lysozyme, followed by a gradual inflection of the plot as the concentration increases to reach an asymptotic region where all sites become occupied (Fig. 18.4) . Besides the apparent K eq , relevant information for the experimentalist is the maximal amount of bound adsorbate Q max per surface area or weight of particulate material (value at asymptote), which can be used to determine the maximal vaccine dose. Finally, the fitted q values give the fraction of sites occupied, which is also valuable information to determine the working concentration of antigen needed to achieve a desired coverage of the adjuvant particles. Reducing the concentration (i.e., the amount) of antigen to achieve similar site occupancy can also prove economical with expensive antigens.

Data points were fitted using nonlinear least squares regression.

This was not the case if the mice were immunized with Freund complete adjuvant. However, as the proliferative responses were inhibited by anti-CD4 antibody, regardless of the adjuvant used, it indicated that the proliferating CD4 \u00fe T cells from mice immunized using aluminum adjuvant were of the Th2 subset.

However, they concluded that the Th2 response could not be due to IL-13, since the IL-13 response too is impaired in STAT6-or IL-4Ra-deficient mice. 82 The role of IL-18 in the adjuvant activity of aluminum hydroxide and its effect on Th2 induction was studied by Brewers group. 80 They demonstrated that IL-18deficient mice immunized with OVA \u00fe Al(OH) 3 had reduced IL-4 production in lymph node cells compared with wild-type mice. However, if they added exogenous IL-18, it did not further enhance the aluminum-induced Th2 response.

Ulanova et al. 83 were among the first to carry out systematic studies on the direct effect of aluminum hydroxide in cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). They found an increase in the expression of costimulatory and adhesion molecules: MHC class II, CD40, CD54 (formerly known as intercellular adhesion molecule 1, or ICAM-1), CD58 (formerly known as lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 or LFA-3), CD83 (maturation marker), and CD86 (formerly known as B7-2) on the monocytes as well as an increase of mRNA for IL-4. However, in the presence of anti-IL-4 antibody or in highly purified monocyte cultures (i.e., depleted of CD4 \u00fe T cells) there was no increase in MHC class II expression. So, apparently, aluminum adjuvanteinduced monocyte-derived cytokines stimulated CD4 \u00fe T cells to secrete IL-4, which in turn stimulated MHC class II expression on the monocyte surface. Rimaniol and coworkers 84 cultivated human monocytes (PBMC) in medium alone or medium containing aluminum hydroxide adjuvant and observed the phenotypic macrophage changes. The changes encountered involved significant upregulation of HLA-DR, as well as CD86 and CD71. Almost 80% of the macrophages obtained were positive for the scavenger receptor CD163. However, incubation with aluminum hydroxide downregulated both Fc g R and CD163. Macrophages, as they expressed a dendritic cell (DC)elike phenotype after incubation with aluminum hydroxide (HLA-DR high , CD86 high , and CD14 \u00c0 ), were further investigated for the expression of DCe specific markers. The expression of CD83 increased after 15 h of incubation with aluminum hydroxide, compared with noneAl(OH) 3 -stimulated cells. It turned out that adjuvant-stimulated macrophages were also superior in antigen presentation. Based on these findings, Rimaniol et al. concluded that stimulation with aluminum adjuvant led to differentiation of the macrophages into a form sharing some features with, but still distinctly different from, DCs.",

According to this approach uptake of Al-adjuvanted vaccines by DCs is accompanied by K \u00fe efflux and three intracellular proteins, known as NALP3 (also known as cryopyrin), CARDINAL, and ASC, then join to form the so-called NALP3 inflammasome (Fig. 18.5) , possibly through phagosomal destabilization. 86 Upon assembly the NALP3 inflammasome induces cleavage of the 45-kDa procaspase-1 turning it into the active caspase-1 enzyme, which is able to cleave pro-IL-1b and pro-IL-18 into their active counterparts: IL-1b and IL-18. These can then leave the DC as active, proinflammatory cytokines. 87e90 In NALP3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice no significant increase in IL-1b was seen when compared with the level seen in mice receiving saline or antigen alone, 87 and since the process could take place in MyD88-deficient mice, 88 it was not considered MyD88 dependent.",

Uric acid crystals are very powerful danger signals 91 released from dying cells as breakdown products of nucleic acids and, in what appears to be a combination of the two views, it has been suggested that phagocytic cells taking up aluminum adjuvants may release uric acid crystals as danger signals, stimulating the formation of the NALP3 inflammasome in DCs. 92 It remains to be established if other danger signals, such as HSP70 (a 70 kDa heat shock protein) also lead to the stimulation of the NALP3 inflammasome, but there are some indications that it may be the case. One observation considered supportive was reported by Alexzander Asea's group from the Harvard Medical School. They demonstrated that extracellular HSP70 added to human monocyte cultures elicited a rapid intracellular Ca \u00fe\u00fe flux, activated nuclear factor NF-kB, and upregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6. 93 In a follow-up study, they demonstrated that HSP70 utilized both the TLR2 and TLR4 receptors for proinflammatory signal transduction in a CD14-dependent fashion. 94 ",

Upon degradation of calcium phosphate, the two constituents can be reutilized in the normal physiological pathways for Ca \u00fe\u00fe and PO \u00c0 4 respectively, whereas in contrast to other metallic ions, like Zn \u00fe\u00fe and Mg \u00fe\u00fe , aluminum apparently does not act as essential trace element or coenzyme in the normal metabolism. However, previous claims that aluminum adjuvants are not broken down in situ and excreted have been shown to be incorrect. The in vivo clearing of parentally administered aluminum adjuvants has been investigated in rabbits by Flarend et al. using adjuvants prepared from the isotope 26 Al. 105 Blood-and urine-excreted 26 Al was followed using accelerator mass spectroscopy for a period of 28 days. As early as 1 h following intramuscular (IM) injection, radioactive labeled Al could be detected in the blood and it was found that approximately three times more 26 Al was excreted from animals vaccinated with aluminum phosphate than those vaccinated with aluminum hydroxide. Assumingly, interstitial fluid containing organic acids with an a-hydroxy carboxylic acid, able to chelate Al, reacted more readily with aluminum phosphate than with aluminum hydroxide. 105 At day 28, the rabbits were euthanized, the main organs were digested using nitric acid, and the radioactivity measured. The relative tissue distribution of radiolabeled Al was: kidney > spleen > liver > heart > lymph node > brain. It is likely that the excretion through blood and urine described earlier primarily involves Al dissolved under the influence of interstitial fluid, whereas the radioactivity detected in lymph nodes and spleen also involved Al adjuvant taken up by APCs. Following injection of aluminum hydroxide adjuvant containing 0.85 mg Al the normal plasma concentration of 30 ng Al/mL only rose by approximately 2 ng Al/mL in Flarend's rabbits. According to the calculation of Flarend, a similar Al dose injected into humans, provided similar clearing kinetics existed, would lead to an estimated increase of serum Al of only 0.04 ng Al/mL, equaling 0.8% above the normal level of approximately 5 ng Al/mL. As the applied dose of 0.85 mg Al corresponds to what is normally used in human vaccines, it seems that the amount of aluminum administered via vaccination does not contribute significantly to the normal exposure to aluminum in humans and serum levels of aluminum.",

The local reaction may be negligible if the inoculum is rapidly dispersed from the injection site. However, if the inoculum resides for a prolonged period at the injection site (as is the case with repository adjuvants like mineral adjuvants or water-in-oil emulsions), then in situ accumulation of phagocytic and immunocompetent cells may in some cases manifest itself as an inflammatory focus accompanied by a transient swelling, local irritation, and redness. Some observations of aluminum-adsorbed vaccines giving rise to more local reactions than unadsorbed vaccines with plain toxoid 119 could in part be explained by the plain toxoid vaccine being dispersed from the injection site before a local reaction was established.",

Hence, use of repository adjuvants without temporarily also inducing an inflammatory focus around the inoculum may not be achievable. There are inconsistent observations regarding whether adsorption onto aluminum adjuvants leads to increased or decreased vaccine reactogenicity. 119,120 However, Butler et al. found that adsorption onto aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel) significantly reduced the side effects with combined diphteria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccines. 121 The binding affinity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to aluminum hydroxide is well established and was much higher, than to aluminum phosphate, approximately 280 mg/mg Al versus approximately 3 mg/mg Al. 122 This difference is ascribed to the phosphate groups of LPS giving a higher degree of ligand exchange with aluminum hydroxide than with aluminum phosphate. It is conceivable that the acute toxicity is reduced in adsorbed vaccines simply by a delayed release of toxic vaccine constituents, like pertussis toxin, peptidoglycans from gramnegative cell walls, or LPS from the injection site. Norimatsu found that adsorption of LPS onto aluminum hydroxide prior to injection inhibited or mitigated systemic effects like the trembling, transient leucopenia and elevated serum TNF-a otherwise observed following IM injection of LPS in saline. 123 Also, the level of IL-6 after administration of LPS was reduced if the LPS was adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide prior to injection. 122 Attempts have been made to link the presence of a local inflammatory focus in the myofascii (macrophagic myofasciitis, MMF) after IM injections of Al-adjuvanted vaccines to conditions, like myalgia and muscle fatigue. Such manifestations can partly be explained by the formation of adjuvant granulomas in the muscle tissue. However, MMF was also claimed to be associated with neurological disorders having no obvious etiologic relation to the vaccination. 124 However, such correlations are associated with statistical challenges. Due to the very high vaccination coverage in the Western countries, it is expected statistically that patients suffering from a wide range of unrelated diseases would all have been vaccinated with Al-containing vaccines at some point in their medical history. In a controlled study in cynomolgus monkeys, it was not possible to detect any histological changes besides the local inflammatory focus itself and no abnormal clinical signs were associated with it. 125",
