The underlying mechanisms of SARS are still largely undefined. Long pentraxin PTX3, a humoral mediator of innate immunity, has been reported to have anti-viral effects. We examined the role of PTX3 in Coronavirus murine hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1)-induced acute lung injury, a previously reported animal model for SARS. PTX3 deficient mice (129/SvEv/C57BL6/J) and their wild type littermates were intranasally infected MHV-1. These mice were also treated with recombinant PTX3. Effects of PTX3 on viral binding and infectivity were determined in vitro. Cytokine expression, severity of lung injury, leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses were examined in vivo. In PTX3wild type mice, MHV -1 induced PTX3 expression in the lung and serum in a time dependent manner. MHV-1 infection led to acute lung injury with greater severity in PTX3 deficient mice than that in wild type mice. PTX3 deficiency enhanced early infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in the lung. PTX3 bound to MHV-1 and MHV-3 and reduced MHV-1 infectivity in vitro. Administration of recombinant PTX3 significantly accelerated viral clearance in the lung; attenuated MHV-1 induced lung injury, and reduced early neutrophil influx and elevation of inflammatory mediators in the lung. Results from this study indicate a protective role of PTX3 in coronaviral infectioninduced acute lung injury.",

In certain circumstances, airway viral infections lead to severe lung injury and become life-threatening diseases, especially in patients at the extremes of age (<6 and >60) or with pre-existing medical conditions (1, 2) . In 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a coronavirus resulted in approximately 8,000 cases with over 700 deaths globally (3) . The potential for global viral pandemics was further illustrated by the outbreak of H5N1 influenza (avian flu) in 2008 and H1N1 influenza (swine flu) in 2009, with severe morbidity and mortality, as well as high economic costs (1) . Although a number of studies in both animal models of SARS (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) and in patients with SARS (9) have been published, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection have not been fully elucidated.",

PTX3 plays a non-redundant role in the immune response to fungi and certain bacterial infections, with potential therapeutic effects in experimental infections (17, 18) . The serum level of PTX3 is elevated in severe dengue infection (19) . PTX3 can bind to human and murine cytomegalovirus (CMV), and inhibit viral infectivity in vitro and protect mice from CMV primary infection and reactivation in vivo (20) . Similarly, selective binding between PTX3 and certain strains of influenza viruses have been reported. PTX3 treatment attenuated virulence in vitro and in vivo, and showed potential therapeutic effects by reducing the virus load and enhancing the survival of infected animals (21) . Smits et al., found that PTX3, among other genes, such as VCAM1, F3 and IL-8, was significantly increased after SARS-CoV infection in aged macaques (22) .",

Semi-quantitative analysis revealed that the recruitment of both neutrophils and macrophages in the lung was increased in a time-dependent manner until day 8 post infection.

There was significantly higher positive staining of both neutrophils and macrophages in PTX3-KO mouse lungs compared to the PTX3-WT group at day 1 and day 2 post-infection (Fig 4B and 5B ).",

Recombinant PTX3 significantly reduced lung injury in PTX3-KO and littermate WT mice. The reduction of exogenous PTX3 on acute lung injury is more effective in the PTX3-KO mice than in the WT mice. This may be due to the dose used, timing, or route of administration, and does not rule out an effect of PTX3, but it should be further studied. The genetic background of mice in the present study is 129/SvEv/C57BL6/J. We have shown that the severity of acute lung injury induced by airway infection of MHV-1 varies depending upon the strains of mice (4) . The function of PTX3 in different strains of mice thus merits further investigation. This will be clinically relevant because the susceptibility of patients to SARS-CoV also varies. Different strains of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV have been developed by Subbarao's (6) and Barnard's groups (7), respectively. It would be interesting to further test the potential protective effects of PTX3 with these viruses, which may be more directly relevant to SARS.",

We have shown that PTX3 deficiency also worsens the lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (36) . These findings are consistent with a newly defined antiinflammatory role of PTX3 in the recruitment of inflammatory cells, in which PTX3 binds to P-selectin and attenuates neutrophil migration to the sites of inflammation (37) . Therefore, in addition to its effects on viral binding and facilitating viral clearance, it is reasonable to speculate that the regulatory function of PTX3 on inflammatory responses may confer further protective effects in coronavirus-induced lung injury. It has been shown that the severity of pulmonary lesions induced by MHV infection correlated better to the elevated inflammatory responses than to the viral replication in the lung (38) .

Alveolar macrophages are key effector cells of the innate immune response to pathogen invasion (39), but may also be able to modulate excessive inflammation and render an immune-suppressive effect in the lung (40) . Unlike neutrophil influx, which decreased one week after MHV-1 infection and was inhibited by PTX3 treatment, macrophage infiltration remained elevated in the lung even at two weeks post MHV-1 infection. PTX3 administration further increased the influx of macrophages in the lungs of PTX3 KO mice. We speculate that macrophages may play an important role in anti-viral immunity, viral clearance and lung tissue repair, although the mechanisms for this effect remains undefined at this time. MCP-1 (CCL2) and MIP-1\u03b2 (CCL4) are chemokines related to monocyte recruitment. Interestingly, both of these chemokines were down-regulated by exogenous PTX treatment in the lung of PTX3 KO mice. It is possible that in PTX3 KO mice, the regulation of macrophages in the lung is altered due to unknown compensatory mechanisms.",

(D) Recombinant PTX3 enhanced viral clearance. *: P<0.05, vs. PBS control group. (E) PTX3 treatment reduced lung injury (H&E staining). (F) Lung injury scores were assessed in a blinded fashion. *: P<0.05, vs. other groups, #: P<0.05 vs. WT-PTX treated. Data shown are mean \u00b1 SD from 4 mice/group.",
