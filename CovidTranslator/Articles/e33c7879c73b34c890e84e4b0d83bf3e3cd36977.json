It is also important to recognize the differences in normal ocular structure among the various species, and the different rates at which mature form is attained. For example, the retina of carnivore eyes continues to develop for about 6 weeks postnatally, whereas that of ruminants and horses is mature at birth. Thus, something like retinal dysplasia is necessarily an in utero event in ungulates, but may be in response to early postnatal injury in carnivores. apposition of primary optic vesicle to overlying surface ectoderm induces a focal ectodermal thickening, the lens placode. The placode grows to form a primitive lens vesicle. It is the developing lens that orchestrates the invagination of the optic vesicle to form the bilayered optic cup and bring the lining neuroectoderm into the apposition that provides the future photoreceptor and pigment epithelial layers. Surrounding the optic cup is a mass of mesenchyme, derived from neural crest, which will form the vascular and fibrous tunics of the eye (iris and ciliary body stroma, corneal stroma and endothelium, choroid and sclera) under the induction of the differentiating neuroectoderm ( Fig. 4.2) . Ocular adnexa and muscles form independently and seem not to require normal development of the globe, as evidenced by the presence of normal lacrimal gland, lids, and extraocular muscles in most cases of severe microphthalmos.",

In Collies, they usually arise within or just adjacent to the optic disk. They appear to arise as focal defects in maturation and/or induction of sclera and choroid by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that is forming from the outer layer of the optic cup. Because the exact location of the embryonic fissure is somewhat variable, it is difficult to determine how many examples of coloboma are the result of delayed closure of that normal embryologic structure, and how many represent some more fundamental defect in the proper interaction of RPE and the developing periocular mesenchyme destined to form choroid and sclera. Proper maturation of the RPE, and in particular the normal acquisition of pigmentation, appears to be critical to the induction of normal mesenchymal migration and maturation. Its failure results in such varied anomalies as choroidal hypoplasia, segmental or diffuse iris and ciliary hypoplasia (known clinically as iris coloboma), and even microphthalmia. Because of its frequent association with the merle dilution defect in the coat color of dogs, the general syndrome is known as merle ocular dysgenesis. It is similar, but not identical, to Collie eye anomaly. The same defect occurs, with much less frequency, in color-dilute (incompletely albinotic) horses, cattle, non-merle dogs, and cats. A similar pathogenesis and spectrum of lesions, not proven to be associated with color dilution, occurs in Collie eye anomaly (see later). In Charolais cattle, colobomas of (or near) the optic disk are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. The lesion is bilateral but not necessarily equal in severity.",

The posterior half of this perilenticular vascular tunic is formed by invasion of mesoderreal endothelial cell precursors and supporting perivascular mesenchyme through the optic fissure to form the extensive but transient hyaloid artery system (see Fig. 4 .2). Another mesenchymal wave accompanies the ingrowth of the neurectoderm at the anterior lip of the optic cup to form the iris stroma, although it is unclear which layer acts as the primary inducer.

It is relatively most frequent in horses, where it may be inherited and associated with cataract and conjunctival dermoids. The defect presumably results from incomplete inward migration of the anterior lip of the optic cup, with resultant lack of a neurectodermal scaffold to guide the subsequent migration of mesenchyme destined to form the iris stroma. The hypoplasia is usually severe and most cases are clinically described as aniridia. Histologic examination of such eyes usually reveals the vestigial iris as a triangular mesenchymal stump covered posteriorly by normal-appearing pigmented epithelium ( Fig. 4 .12A).The trabecular meshwork within the filtration angles may be malformed, but the ciliary apparatus is usually normal.The lens often is cataractous ( Fig. 4 .12B) and sometimes ectopic or hypoplastic. Glaucoma has been described as a sequel in horses (but not in other species), but it should be an expected sequel in severely affected eyes in any species because of the inevitable concurrent trabecular hypoplasia (Fig 4.12A) . Hypopigmentation of the iris may be unilateral or bilateral. When the loss of pigment is patchy in one or both irises, it is known as heterochromia iridis. The pigmentation may be diffusely absent in the iris stroma but present in the posterior iris epithelium (subalbinotic), or absent in both stroma and epithelium (true albinism). The iris is normal except for absence of visible pigment granules in the cytoplasm of otherwise normal stromal melanocytes and epithelial cells. Tapetum and, less reliably, choroid of affected eyes usually are hypoplastic as well as poorly pigmented. Atrophy of the pupillary membrane is frequently incomplete at birth and, in dogs, persistent remnants are common up to about 6 months of age.",

There is a tendency in clinical literature to group all of these defects under the umbrella of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, but histologically there is quite a wide range in the nature of the defect. Only the most severe qualify as true persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. The hyaloid artery and its branches are formed from mesenchyme and pre-endothelial mesoderm that enter the optic cup through the optic fissure prior to its closure. The vessel traverses the optic cup from optic disk to lens, where it ramifies over the posterior lens surface (posterior tunica vasculosa lentis). It joins with the vascular portion of the pupillary membrane (anterior tunica vasculosa lentis) to form a complete perilenticular vascular tunic. As with its anterior chamber counterpart, the hyaloid system undergoes almost complete atrophy before birth. Persistence of some vestige into adult life is common and clinically insignificant. In ruminants, the most common remnant is Bergmeister's papilla, a cone of glial tissue with a vascular core that extends from optic disk for a few millimeters into the vitreous (Fig.4.16) . In calves up to about 2 months of age, the vestigial hyaloid , tg perivascular mesenchyme. Surrounding the hyaloid system is some primitive collagen, poorly characterized extracellular matrix, and a few macrophages.The combination of blood vessels and surrounding stroma is known as the primary vitreous. At least theoretically, anomalous retention of the hyaloid artery and~or primary vitreous could therefore be separated into distinct entities of persistent hyaloid, persistent posterior tunica vasculosa lentis, persistent primary vitreous, and persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. Of these, the one most frequently reported (perhaps just because it is the most spectacular and significant) is persistent hyperplastie primary vitreous. In people, this rare anomaly is typically unilateral and is accompanied by microphthalmos, microphakia, retinal detachment, shallow anterior chamber, and embryonic filtration angles.The many reports of this anomaly in dogs have described a unilateral or bilateral retrolental vascular or fibrovascular network, usually without any other reported anomalies other than the expected posterior polar cataract. Such lesions are better described as persistent posterior tunica vasculosa lentis. In Doberman Pinschers, Bouviers and Staffordshire Bull Terriers, the classification as hyperplastic primary vitreous is more credible. In these breeds, the defect is inherited and forms a spectrum that includes persistent pupillary membrane, cataract, lenticonus, and microphthalmia as well as persistence of variable amounts of primary vitreous and posterior tunica vasculosa lentis (Fig. 4.17 A, B) . The defects are detected as early as gestational day 30, at which time hyperplasia of posterior tunica vasculosa lentis is already obvious. Posterior polar cataracts and preretinal membranes are observed by day 37.The one report of two cases in cats was not supported by histopathology and its correct classification remains unknown. ",

Those examples of retinal dysplasia in which the only abnormality is retinal folding are by far the most common, and are seen primarily in dogs.The anatomic location, ophthalmoscopic appearance, and effect on vision vary from breed to breed but tend to be uniform within each breed, a fact used by clinical ophthalmologists when attempting to distinguish inherited dysplasias from those occurring as isolated anomalies or as sequelae to in utero infections. The most severe examples occur in dogs with retinal nonattachment.These have extensively folded retinas since the distance to be traversed from optic disk to ora ciliaris in a straight line is shorter than the convex route taken by attached retina, and redundant retina is therefore obliged to fold upon itself. Less severe examples, which are seen much more frequently and in the greatest variety of breeds, probably reflect inequity in growth rate between the retina and the outer layer of the optic cup (choroid and sclera). The most common example is probably seen in Collie eye anomaly and in American Cocker Spaniels, in which the defect may be transient. Presumably, the folds become flattened and disappear as continued choroidal and scleral growth eventually create a globe that can accommodate the retina. At least in Collies (and other related breeds with syndromes similar to Collie eye anomaly), the retinal lesion is probably secondary to defective RPE. Since the other defects of choroidal/scleral formation and maturation are attributed to faulty induction by a defective RPE, it is reasonable to attribute the retinal folding to the same mechanism (Fig 4.18) .",

A similar lesion occurs in pigs, but in that species hypovitaminosis A seems more indiscriminately teratogenic, and optic nerve hypoplasia is accompanied by diffuse ocular dysplasia and multiple systemic anomalies. Hypoplasia is a relatively frequent clinical diagnosis in toy breeds of dogs, without apparent visual defects (and thus rarely receives histologic examination).

The histologic lesion is distinctive and comes in two forms that may occur independently or in conjunction with one another. The more common is an accumulation of large foamy macrophages and multinucleated cells around the abnormal Meibomian gland. The macrophages contain distinctive refractile intracellular slender elongated crystals that have a bright silvery-white appearance when examined with polarized light.Alternatively, the reaction may consist of a mixture of these macrophages and lakes of free lipid. In routine sections, these appear as clear empty spaces that could be confused with dilated lymphatics (Fig. 4.22A, B) . This latter variant was originally described in cats as idiopathic lipogranulomatous conjunctivitis (see below), but current opinion is that it is just a feline version of chalazion.",

Specific dacryoadenitis caused by a coronavirus is extremely common in laboratory rats in which acute necrotizing inflammation of lacrimal, Harderian and salivary glands results in eventual fibrosis and squamous metaplasia of affected glands. Residual lesions in mildly affected rats are multiple lymphoid aggregates in the glandular interstitium. Similar changes are often seen in dogs with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and in the absence of demonstrated viral cause, are assumed to represent autoimmune lacrimal adenitis.

The ocular discharge progresses from serous to mucoid and perhaps purulent with increasing severity of insult. Chronic irritation results in epithelial hyperplasia, hyperplasia of goblet cells and lymphoid aggregates, or even squamous metaplasia progressing to keratinization. The goblet cell hyperplasia is a very uncommon lesion when compared to squamous metaplasia and lymphoid hyperplasia. Lymphoid hyperplasia may be so marked as to result in grossly visible white nodules that may require surgical or chemical removal to reduce irritation of the adjacent cornea.Although characteristic of a number of etiologically specific conjunctival diseases, lymphoid hyperplasia is best considered a nonspecific response to any chronic antigenic stimulation. Conjunctivitis frequently accompanies other ocular disease, notably keratitis, uveitis, and glaucoma.

The species most commonly associated with conjunctivitis in domestic animals are T. lacrymalis in horses; T. rhodesi, T. gulosa, T. skrjabini in ruminants; T. callipaeda in carnivores and humans; and T. californiensis in many species including dog, cat, bear, coyote, deer, and man.

The adherence of ciliary processes to the lens represents an arrest in remodeling rather than improper development.Incomplete atrophy of the anterior chamber mesenchymeis relatively common in dogs and occurs occasionally in other domestic species. During organogenesis, waves of mesenchyme migrate between the surface ectoderm and the anterior rim of the optic cup. Some of the ingrowing mesenchyme forms corneal endothelium and stroma, while other portions of mesenchyme form the iris stroma and trabecular meshwork. Some of that mesenchyme occupies the anterior chamber and, as it matures, it forms a fibrovascular sheet stretching across the face of the lens and developing iris, known as the pupillary membrane. Its vascular component creates the anterior portion of an embryonic perilenticular vascular plexus, known as the tunica uasculosa lentis. Both the pupillary membrane and the tunica vasculosa lentis normally disappear late in gestation or in the early postnatal period.

            "text": "Presumed allergic conjunctivitis occurs in all species but is most likely to be investigated in dogs (most examples of conjunctivitis in cats are assumed to have an infectious pathogenesis). Rarely is a specific allergen identified and, like its counterparts in allergic skin diseases, the diagnosis is based upon the failure to demonstrate infectious or mechanical causes, response to corticosteroid therapy, and sometimes a convincing association with environmental changes. Biopsy is rarely warranted, but when taken during the acute disease may show epithelial changes ranging from erosion to hyperplasia to squamous metaplasia, with eosinophils around dilated subepithelial blood vessels and percolating throughout the epithelium. Eosinophils are much more likely to be identified in cats than in dogs, a species difference that is also true of allergic skin disease in general. More chronic lesions, which are the more usual to be biopsied, have squamous metaplasia and lymphocytic-plasmacytic subepithelial infiltrates and the formation of lymphoid nodules.There are a few histologically distinctive examples of conjunctivitis that are assumed to represent immune-mediated disease, mostly because they respond only to aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. In some dogs with chronic conjunctivitis (perhaps particularly German Shepherd Dogs), the infiltrate sometimes becomes particularly plasmacytic, diffuse, and thick in a fashion resembling an interface dermatitis. The bulbar surface of the third eyelid is the favorite location, and many believe this lesion (sometimes referred to as \"plasmoma\") to be the conjunctival variant of pannus keratitis.Cats and horses may develop a severe eosinophilic conjunctivitis that is thought, by some, to be a conjunctival counterpart of the eosinophilic keratitis syndrome. Lesions may be unilateral or bilateral, and at least in cats there is almost always a concurrent ulcerative marginal blepharitis. Histologic changes include ulceration, epithelial hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, and a hea W lymphocytic infiltration with a large proportion of eosinophils. Lesions in cats contain no detectable infectious agent, and no herpesviral DNA can be detected (the role ofherpesviral infection in the pathogenesis of histologically similar eosinophilic keratitis in cats remains controversial). The clinical syndrome is rapidly responsive to topical corticosteroid administration.Ligneous conjunctivitis is a distinctive clinical and histologic entity, thus far described only in Doberman Pinscher dogs.The clinical disease is bilateral and characterized by marked thickening and opacity of the palpebral conjunctiva and conjunctiva of the third eyelid. Histologically, the conjunctival lamina propria is thickened by massive deposition of hyaline material and a diffuse scattering of mononuclear leukocytes. Most of the leukocytes are T-lymphocytes, and the hyaline material stains weakly for IgG and IgA.Feline lipogranulomatous conjunctivitis is probably the feline counterpart of canine chalazion. The lesion occurs almost exclusively in the lamina propria of the palpebral conjunctiva adjacent to the margin of either the upper or lower eyelid. The histology is very repeatable, consisting of a nodular accumulation of clear lipid lakes intermingled with large foamy macrophages and a few small or mononuclear leukocytes. Although the original report contained no mention of adjacent Meibomian lobules, the similarity between this entity and some cases of canine chalazion (or granulomatous dermatitis adjacent to injured cutaneous sebaceous glands) is striking and impossible to ignore (see Fig. 4 .22B).",

Embryologically, the epithelium is derived from surface ectoderm; the stroma and corneal endothelium are from neural crest mesenchyme.The major attribute of cornea is its clarity, and it is the loss of clarity that is the most obvious indicator of corneal disease.The clarity results from several highly specialized anatomic and physiologic features: an unusually regular, nonkeratinized and nonpigmented surface epithelium; an avascular, cell-poor stroma composed of very thin collagen (mostly type I) fibrils arranged in orderly lamellae separated by a critical",
