In the present study, duodenal molecules were isolated from normal mice which had potent virucidal activity, when tested against LDV as well as canine herpes, canine hepatitis, Semliki forest, and visna viruses. The virucidal activity was demonstrated to be non-immune in nature, and was present in apparently nonenzymatic protein molecules, having a molecular mass of between 10-100 kDa by membrane filtration and 10-17 kDa by gel filtration. The anti-LDV activity of these molecules was suppressed by anti-duodenum antibodies in vitro, and in vivo studies suggested a possible protective role for the anti-viral molecules. We conclude that the normal mouse duodenum contains potent virucidal molecules, which are of interest to the study of biological and molecular mechanisms of viral resistance.",

Protection at mucosal sites may be mediated by physical or chemical mechanisms, which restrict the attachment of viruses to host target cells (Braude, 1981) . Viral infection at intact mucosal sites may require a large number of virions, i.e. a minimum infectious dose (MID) sufficient to overwhelm mucosal defense mechanisms (Ward and Akin, 1984) . Although these defense mechanisms are incompletely understood, they may include both antibody (specific) as well as non-specific molecules which can disable viruses (Ward and Akin, 1984) . The presence of non-specific anti-viral molecules has been described in human saliva (Fultz, 1986; Archibald and Cole, 1990) and bovine milk (Panon et al., 1987) , and such molecules may represent protective barriers to virus infections.",

The mechanism of persistence is related to infection of a permissive subpopulation of macrophages which continuously evolves in vivo, as well as inability of the immune response to clear the virus (Rowson and Mahy, 1985; Cafruny, 1989; Bradley et al., 1991) . There is a powerful relative mucosal barrier to LDV infection, demonstrated by a MID of over 100,000 virions for orally administered LDVI in contrast to a MID of one virion by parenteral exposure (Cafruny and Hovinen, 1988) . The nature of the mucosal barrier to LDV infection is not clear, but it consists in part of non-specific biochemical factors which appear to be prostaglandin-sensitive .",

On weeks 12 and 13, the rabbit was immunized with 2.5 mg duodenum i.v. Monitoring of the anti-duodenum titer by ELISA indicated increasing levels of anti-duodenum IgG, and on week 14 the rabbit was sacrificed and serum was collected, which had an anti-duodenum IgG titer of 1:256,000 by ELISA. The antiserum also displayed broad reactivity with mouse duodenum by Western immunoblot (data not shown). This serum was used for oral administration by pipet to normal mice, prior to exposure to a limiting dose of LDV by the oral route (Cafruny and Hovinen, 1988) . The mice were then evaluated 4 days later for LDV infection. This rabbit serum was also tested for anti-LDV inhibitor activity by direct in vitro mixing with LDV inhibitor. Control rabbit serum from an unimmunized rabbit was used in these experiments, and control antibody from a rabbit immunized with an irrelevant antigen (Mycoplasma fraction D) and Freund's adjuvant was also used to demonstrate specificity.",

When the LDVinhibitory G75 column fraction was tested against Semliki forest virus (pretreated titer=5 x 107 PFU/ml), there was approximately 94% inactivation (post-treated titer = 3 \u00d7 l06 PFU/ml). aLDV was incubated with 1(~17 kDa G200 or G75 fractions of small intestine extracts for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, and the pre-and post-incubation titers were determined.

Fig. 2 shows the sucrose density gradient profile of labeled intact virions, and also the results of analyses of labeled virions which were treated with duodenal extract prior to centrifugation on 0.5-1.5 M sucrose density gradients. Untreated intact virions migrated within sucrose gradients to a single major peak, representing a density of about 1.14 g/cc (Brinton-Darnell and Plagemann, 1975) . Pretreatment of labeled intact virions with 30 mg/ml of heated (56\u00b0C for 30 min) mouse duodenal extract for 10 rain at 37\u00b0C had little or no effect on the sucrose density gradient profile (peaks within 0.5 ml in the representative experiment shown in Fig. 2) , suggesting that LDV inactivation by the mouse duodenal inhibitor was not due to gross disruption of the virion. In contrast, during incubation of intact labeled virions with non-heated duodenal extract there was extensive disruption of the virion, as shown by loss of the [3H]uridine-labeled peak. These results are explained by the sensitivity of tissue-culture-derived LDV to enzymes such as trypsin (Kowalchyk and Plagemann, 1985; Broen and Cafruny, unpublished data) , in contrast to blood plasma-derived virus, which is protected from the action of trypsin and probably other factors (Crispens, 1965; Broen and Cafruny, unpublished data) . Thus, heating of duodenal extract eliminates extraneous factors which disrupt tissue-culture-derived virus, but preserves anti-LDV activity and allows its analysis in the absence of other factors which may disrupt the virion. (Brinton-Darnell and Plagernann, 1975) . Standard labeled virus (A) displayed a peak at about 1.14 g/cc (Brinton-Darnell and Plagemann, 1975) .

For the in vivo experiment (A), mice were dosed at times 25 and l0 rain pre-LDV-exposure with 25 /~1 rabbit anti-mouse duodenum or normal rabbit serum. % positive (Expt.

The antiduodenum antibody alone had no effect on the replication of LDV in mouse macrophage cultures. A separate control experiment is shown in which control Ab from a rabbit immunized with an irrelevant Ag (Mycoplasma fraction D) and Freund's adjuvant failed to inactivate the duodenal inhibitor. Representative data are shown for two indepe.ndent experiments (Expt. B) indicating the % of cultured macrophages becoming LDV infected during in vitro infection.",

Anti-inhibitor activity of the rabbit antiserum was also demonstrated in vitro, since incubation of LDV with the inhibitor for 10 min prior to infection of cultured mouse macrophages resulted in abrogation of the virus infection (a representative experiment is show in Table 4B ), and this effect was reversed in the presence of the anti-duodenum antibody. Control experiments employing normal rabbit serum and rabbit antibodies to an irrelevant antigen (Table  4B ) demonstrate the immune specificity of the anti-duodenum antibody.",

As shown in Table 5 , the hepatitis, herpes, Semliki forest, and visna viruses were all susceptible to the virucidal effect of the mouse duodenal extracts while vaccinia virus was resistant. In contrast to the case with LDV, extracts from other mouse tissues showed varying degrees of viral inhibition against these viruses (data not shown). For example stomach extracts were found to inhibit canine herpes, hepatitis, and vaccinia viruses, but in the case of stomach, heating at 56\u00b0C for 20 rain abrogated inhibitory activity against canine hepatitis virus. Visna virus was inhibited by mouse stomach extract to about the same extent as with duodenum extract; we have not assessed the effect of heating the stomach extract in the visna system. Pretreatment of the tissue culture cells with duodenum or small intestine extracts had no effect on virus replication, showing that the anti-viral effects were not due to inhibition of cellular metabolism or cytotoxic activity.",

Using this estimate, a molar coefficient of anti-LDV activity of between 2.3-4.0 \u00d7 10-5 M may be calculated. These figures must be viewed as estimates only, since the molecule(s) responsible for virus inactivation have not yet been clearly identified, and they may potentially undergo some degree of dissociation or alteration during gel filtration. The gel filtration resulted in about a 175-fold purification of anti-LDV activity, which should be significant to further attempts to characterize the anti-viral activity. Inhibition of Semliki forest virus occurred with the same purified molecules which had activity against LDV, suggesting a possible dual effect of these purified molecules. However, it appears likely that other factors present in intestine or stomach extracts may be responsible for inactivation of canine herpes and vaccinia viruses, since heated stomach extracts also inactivated these viruses. This is consistent with the presence of a diverse range of potential anti-viral molecules at these sites.",

Viral inactivation by duodenum extract molecules is clearly due to a direct effect on the susceptible viruses, since viral inactivation occurred rapidly in vitro.

This is of interest, since mouse antibodies which are produced during LDV infection neutralize the virus by multi-hit kinetics Cafruny et al., 1986) . However, rabbit IgG has been produced to LDV which neutralized the virus by single-hit kinetics , suggesting that the interaction of duodenal inhibitor with LDV could be via the same molecular mechanism as for neutralizing rabbit antibody. LDV is an enveloped RNA virus which has three known structural proteins (Brinton-Darnell and Plagemann, 1975) . The membrane-associated glycoprotein, VP-3, is the target for rabbit neutralizing antibody (Cafruny et al., 1986) as well as for recently described neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies (Harty and Plagemann, 1988) , and provides the most likely receptor-binding molecule necessary for interaction with susceptible macrophages (Cafruny, 1989; Kowalchyk and Plagemann, 1985) . LDV inactivation by duodenal molecules could be due to analogous binding to VP-3 which disrupts the virus structure, or alternatively could result from a membrane alteration independent of VP-3 binding. Since heat-treated duodenum extracts failed to markedly alter the virion density, it is apparent that the duodenal inhibitor acts without disrupting the entire virion. It is likely that the disruption of the virion which was observed with non-heattreated duodenum extracts was due to the contribution of additional heatsensitive factors, including enzymes. No common inhibitor pathway can be deduced from our data, since the 5 viruses which were inhibited by duodenal molecules represent diverse viral structures and genomes.",
