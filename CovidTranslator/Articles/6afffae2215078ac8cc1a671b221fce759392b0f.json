Moreover, it is also possible to trigger an exacerbated response to some common bacterial, fungal and protozoal pathogens, occasionally (Dunham and Graham, 2008; Reche et al., 2010) . In rescue cat shelters, viruses such as Feline herpesvirus type I (FHV-1), Feline calicivirus (FCV), Feline coronavirus (FCoV) and Feline parvovirus (FPV) are also important infectious agents to consider. They are particularly exacerbated when incoming animals are introduced to the shelters. However, even in stable resident shelters, intermittent excretion of these viruses may contribute to continuous spreading to the environment. These concurrent viral infections are potentiated in retroviral infected shelters and easily contribute to a general worsening of the clinical condition of infected cats Radford et al., 2009; Thiry et al., 2009; Truyen et al., 2009) . General management of retroviral infected cats should include an isolation policy, neutering and regular health check-ups, particularly in rescue shelters. For symptomatic cats, supportive general treatment should always be considered Lutz et al., 2009) . Antiviral and immune modulation therapies are important options that should also be considered (Collado et al., 2006) .",

This is due to interaction with specific cell-receptors and concurrent induction of the expression of specific genes that encode cytokines involved in innate immunity. Moreover, type I IFNs also have anti-viral effects, anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory actions (Domenech et al., 2011; Gerlach et al., 2009 Gerlach et al., , 2006 . Type II IFNs are mainly immunomodulatory with only a low level of anti-viral effects, meaning that they are less useful in clinical practice. Currently there are two important IFNs used in veterinary medicine: Human Interferon-a and Recombinant Feline Interferon-x (rFeIFNx), both of them type I IFNs (Collado et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "Although it was proven that Human Interferon-a increases survival time in FIV and FeLV-cats (Pedretti et al., 2006; Weiss et al., 1991) , the development of specific neutralizing antibodies may decrease its efficiency (Muller, 2002; Zeidner et al., 1990) . More recently, rFeIFNx was licensed for use in veterinary medicine, namely for treatment of canine parvovirus and feline retroviral (FIV and FeLV) infections. As an homologous feline molecule, it has a good safety index and does not induce production of neutralizing antibodies (de Mari et al., 2004) . However, despite its license, there is limited published information about the use of rFeIFNx in retroviral infections. Initially, its use in asymptomatic FIV cats was described (Caney et al., 2003) but the first conclusive results were provided by a study that revealed a clinical improvement and an increased survival time in FeLV and co-infected symptomatic cats (de Mari et al., 2004) . A more recent study demonstrated that rFeIFNx improves the clinical condition and haematologic parameters not only in FeLV but also in FIV infected cats (Domenech et al., 2011) . While there are few in-vivo studies to support its expected benefits, the use of rFeIFNx has been extended to other viral infections namely FHV-1, FCoV, FCV and FPV (Hennet et al., 2011; Ishida et al., 2004; Paltrinieri et al., 2007; Ritz et al., 2007; Thiry et al., 2009) .",

Exclusion criteria were: (1) cats that showed clinical signs of malignancy (such as Lymphoma or Lymphoid leukemia), (2) cats having received immunomodulating drugs (such corticotherapy) during the 4 weeks before the study (3) cats having received antibiotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during the 2 weeks before the study and (4) cats that did not complete the therapeutic protocol.",

As rFeIFNx is a licensed product and its efficacy had been described in multiple double arm studies (de Mari et al., 2004; Domenech et al., 2011) , a single arm trial was performed in order to extend our understanding of the improvement of retroviral infected cats under this therapy. A control other than the D0 results, such as a group without treatment or placebo was considered of limited interest and ethically controversial in the context. The control group would be eventually important if we were studying experimental infected animals, where all the cats should be at the same stage of infection. In this case, we have a heterogeneous group of cats and there was difficult to know the point and stage of infection. Even more, these cats were located in a shelter environment where the inclusion of a placebo group was even more controversial ethically. Indeed, the whole point is the therapy in the shelter environment. It is believed that this study reflects the crude reality of cat shelters. In this sense, the decision of establishing a control group before therapy was deliberated and assumed. In our viewpoint, measurements on D0 in the shelter environment are potentially more representative than a placebo with different stages of infection group. Therefore, each cat at day 0 was considered its best untreated control.",

No cat got worse at the end of the study than at the start. When compared with FeLV cats, FIV cats presented a more evident general improve-ment. The fluctuations observed with the FeLV cats during the course of the study contributed to the worsening of clinical scores at interim time points for certain cats. Recognizing that rFeIFNx is an immune-modulator, a possible explanation refers to the fact that FeLV cats have a more compromised immune response in comparison to FIV cats Pardi et al., 1991) . This is mainly due to the fact that FeLV infected cats seem to have a more pronounced defect of helper T-cells. Consequently, these animals have a reduced humoral immune response ). Table 5 .",

At D30 and D65, all cats tested negative for FCV, meaning that rFeIFNx, administered according to this protocol, was associated with a remission of FCV excretion in these cats. Furthermore, only 3 of those cats revealed persistent oral lesions at the end of therapy. The remaining FCV positive animals improved their gingivostomatitis and palatitis. Although FCGS may have a multifactorial etiology, the improvement of oral clinical signs was evident and agreed with the observed reduction in FCV excretion. It is likely that the observed improvement of both the clinical signs and the shedding of FCV was due to a combination of the immunomodulating and the antiviral effects of the treatment. This is especially important in animal shelters where gingivostomatitis is frequently associated with active FCV infection, and animals may also be more likely to experience some stress-induced reduction in immune competence.",

Typical respiratory and ocular signs were not very remarkable in these shelter cats. However, the concurrent clinical improvement and reduction in FHV-1 excretion observed in some cats (31%) lead to conclude that, in particular cases, the reduction of FHV-1 shedding may contribute for a clinical improvement. Despite these good clinical findings for animal shelters, FHV-1 may remain latent and the suppression of viral excretion may not lead to complete cure (Dowers et al., 2010) .
