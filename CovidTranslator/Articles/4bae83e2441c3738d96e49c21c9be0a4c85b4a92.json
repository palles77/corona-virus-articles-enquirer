Chickens were inoculated monovalently (with plasmid pVAX1-16S1, pVAX1-16M, or pVAX1-16N alone) or multivalently (combination of the three different plasmids, pVAX1-16S1/M/N). A prime-boost immunization protocol against IBV was developed. Chickens were immunized with the multivalent DNA vaccine twice and then boosted with an inactivated vaccine once. Antibody titers of the chickens immunized with pVAX1-16S1/M/N were much higher than those of the monovalent groups (p \uff1c 0.01). A protective rate up to 90% was observed in the pVAX1-16S1/M/N group. The serum antibody titers in the prime-boost birds were significantly higher than those of the multivalent DNA vaccine group (p \uff1c 0.01) but not significantly different compared to the inactivated vaccine group at 49 days of age. Additionally, the prime-boost group also showed the highest level of IBV-specific cellular proliferation compared to the monovalent groups (p \uff1c 0.01) but no significant difference was found compared to the multivalent DNA vaccine group, and the prime-boost group completely protected from followed viral challenge.",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a major disease in the poultry industry worldwide. This disease frequently occurs in vaccinated and non-vaccinated flocks, and has caused severe economic loss over the last few years [11] [12] [13] [14] 17, 21] . Protection failure is mainly due to the numerous IB virus (IBV) serotypes and frequent emergence of new variants [23, 26] . Given the economic effects of IBV on the commercial poultry industry, preventing infection with this virus has been continually pursued. Traditional IBV vaccines include inactivated or live attenuated vaccines [2] [3] [4] . However, both types of vaccines have unique disadvantages. Inactivated vaccines can induce the production of relatively high antibody titers but a very low level of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses [5] . Live attenuated vaccines can initiate humoral and cellular immune responses, but lead to the spread the live vaccine viruses [7, 15] . It is therefore necessary to develop novel vaccines and/or optimize current vaccination procedures. IBV belongs to the Coronaviridae family and contains a positive single-stranded RNA genome encoding four major structural proteins: a small envelope protein (E), integral membrane protein (M), phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N), and spike glycoprotein (S) [19] . The S protein is cleaved into two subunits (S1 and S2). The S1 protein is very important for inducing protective immunity and has been successfully used to construct IBV DNA vaccines [6, 9] . The N protein is conserved and induces CTL as well as activated B cell responses, which are critical for preventing IBV infection in poultry [8, 20] . The M glycoprotein can induce the production of detectable antibodies and delayed type hypersensitivity responses [8] . Hence, all of these proteins are primary targets for developing DNA vaccines to elicit immune responses.",

The virulent IBVSX16 strains used to challenge immunized chickens in this study were isolated from the kidneys of IB-infected chickens from the Shanxi province by Department of infectious Disease and immunology, College of Animal Science and Technology, Shanxi Agricultural University [21] . Virus stocks containing 1 \u00d7 10 3 egg infective dosage (EID 50 ) of IBVSX16 with 100 \u03bcL were used to inoculate the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (Shandong Specific-Pathogen-Free Chicken Research Center, China) that were then kept at 37 o C for 48 h. Allantoic fluid containing the virus was harvested after 48 h post-inoculation, stored at \u221280 o C until use. Chill eggs at 4 o C for at least 2 h to kill the embryo and to reduce the contamination of the allantoic fluid with blood during harvesting. Remove sticky tape and swab each egg with cotton wool soaked with 70% alcohol to disinfect and remove condensation from the shells. Dip the forceps or scissors in absolute alcohol and flame to sterilize. Remove the eggshell above the air space. Discard embryos that are visibly contaminated. Remove a sample of allantoic fluid from each egg. The 50% EID 50 /mL of the viral stocks were calculated as previously described by Reed and Muench [25] . Titer of the IBVSX16 strains was 10 9 EID 50 /mL. A total of 140 seven-day-old SPF chickens (Shandong Specific-Pathogen-Free Chicken Research Center, China) were housed in SPF environment at the Laboratory Animal and Resources Facility, Shanxi Agricultural University.",

Immune responses were evaluated in chickens immunized with the DNA vaccines either alone or with a mixture of the three vaccines. Findings from the present study agree with those of a previous investigation showing that all three IBV proteins selected for this study have their own unique and important roles in eliciting IBV immune responses [24] . The DNA vaccination with pVAX1-16M alone provoked the weakest immune response demonstrated by the lowest antibody titers (p \uff1c 0.01) in comparison with pVAX1-16S1 and pVAX1-16N. In contrast, pVAX1-16S1 induced the highest antibody titers among the three constructs. Chickens immunized with pVAX1-16N had significantly higher levels of IBV-specific cellular proliferation (p \uff1c 0.01) and T lymphocytes (p \uff1c 0.01) than birds immunized with pVAX1-16S1 and pVAX1-16M. The challenge assay also proved that the DNA vaccine targeting the N protein is more effective. Chickens that received a combination of the three DNA vaccines also mounted stronger immune responses than the birds immunized with each DNA vaccines alone, suggesting that a combined DNA vaccination with S1, M, and N genes may provide stronger protection against IBV. CD4+ T cells may directly produce antiviral cytokines, which increasing B cell activity and increasing the proliferation, maturation, and functional activity of CD8+ CTLs. The CD8+ CTL plays a critical role in controlling IBV infection [18] . At 49 days of age, chickens immunized with plasmid constructs groups had percentages of CD4+CD3+ and CD8+CD3+ T lymphocytes subgroups higher than those of birds administered the control pVAX1 vector or inactivated vaccine (p \uff1c 0.01). Increased number of T lymphocytes indicates that administration of the DNA vaccine resulted in effective cellular immunization and promoted virus clearance [2] .",

The inactivated vaccine has a better capability than choosing DNA plasmid as the booster to evoke memory B cells [16] . The inactivated vaccine as a booster is also considered to be able to balance the Th1 and Th2 immune responses [10] , which could enhance both specific cell-mediated immunity and neutralizing antibody inductions with increased T cell response. In the current study, the DNA vaccine stimulated a relatively strong IBV-specific cellular response but low antibody titers. When the DNA vaccine and inactivated vaccine were administered in combination, both higher cellular proliferation rates and antibody titers were observed among the DNA vaccine-primed chickens as seen in previous studies [10] . Chickens that received the DNA vaccine with the inactivated vaccine were fully protected from IBVSX16 challenge. None of these animals developed clinical signs or harbored detectable levels of virus in the trachea or kidney after challenge. These results clearly demonstrate that only the combined administration of DNA vaccine and inactivated vaccine, but not either alone, offered full protection from challenge with the IBVSX16 strain.",

We also showed that our prime-boost immunization strategy induced strong immune responses and provided effective protection from challenge with a high dose of virulent IBV. DNA vaccines are easy to prepare and inactivated vaccines are readily available. Administration of DNA vaccines with an inactivated vaccine is a safe and effective immunization technique. Given its superior efficacy, this combination represents a valuable strategy for protecting against IBV infection and can combat poor cross-protection among the numerous IBV serotypes along with the frequent emergence of new variants.",

Each blood sample was tested in triplicate. The microtiter plates . The culture medium was removed by aspiration, and 100 \u03bcL of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma, USA) were added to each well to lyse the cells. The absorbance of each well was measured at 570 nm (A 570 ) with an ELISA microplate reader (model 680; Bio-Rad, USA). Mean A 570 values were used as indicators of peripheral T lymphocyte proliferation.Analysis of T lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+)PBMCs were isolated from blood by lympholyte-mammal (Cedarlane, Canada) and adjusted to 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells / mL with RPMI 1640 medium. The samples (100 \u03bcL; 1 \u00d7 106 cells) was incubated with mouse anti-chicken CD4-PE (BD Biosciences, USA), mouse anti-chicken CD3-SPRD (BD Biosciences, USA), and mouse anti-chicken CD8-FITC (BD Biosciences, USA) primary antibodies (antibody final concentrations as 1.25 \u00b5g/100 \u00b5L) in the dark at 4 o C for 30 min. After the incubation, all samples were washed three times with cold PBS and then resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS. The single-color positive controls were prepared by staining representative cells with mouse anti-chicken CD4-PE, mouse anti-chicken CD3-SPRD, and mouse anti-chicken CD8-FITC antibodies individually and used for estimation of proper compensation. The unstained cell sample was used as a negative control to adjust the correct voltage. The percentages of CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes were determined on flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter, USA).",

Furthermore, chickens in the pVAX1-16S1/M/N + inactivated vaccine group were efficiently protected following viral challenge and showed no clinical signs or death. To evaluate IBV levels after challenge, presence of the virus in the kidney and trachea was detected by RT-PCR. Results of this analysis showed that 10% of the pVAX1-16S1/M/N group and 20% of the birds receiving the inactive vaccine were positive. All chickens in the pVAX1 group were positive according to the RT-PCR analysis. However, none of the birds in the pVAX1-16S1/ M/N + inactivated vaccine group had detectable levels of virus. These results indicated that chickens primed with the multivalent DNA vaccine and boosted with an inactivated vaccine are effectively protected from challenge with virulent IBVSX16 virus.",
