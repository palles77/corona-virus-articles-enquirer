It was also shown that DC-SIGN is a cell-surface adhesion factor that enhances viral entry of several virus families. Among those, Junin virus (JUNV) entry is enhanced in cells expressing DC-SIGN and for that reason surface-layer protein (S-layer) of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4365 was evaluated as a possible JUNV inhibitor. Experiments using 3T3 cells stably expressing DC-SIGN, showed an almost complete inhibition of JUNV infection when they were treated with S-layer in a similar extend as the inhibition shown by mannan. However no inhibition effect was observed in 3T3 wild type cells or in 3T3 cells expressing liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN or DC-SIGNR or CD209L).",

This inhibition does not involve the classic recognition of mannose by this C-type lectin as the S-layer showed no evidence to be glycosylated. In fact, the highly basic nature of the S-layer (pI > 9.5) seems to be involved in electrostatic interactions between DC-SIGN and S-layer, since high pH abolished the inhibitory effect on infection cause by the S-layer. In silico analysis predicts a Ca 2+ -dependant carbohydrate recognition domain in the SlpA protein.",

            "text": "Many species of the genus Lactobacillus possess surface layer (S-layer) proteins which are arrays of a single protein noncovalently bound that constitute the outermost cell envelope also found in several members of Bacteria and Archaea. One of the main characteristics of Lactobacillus S-layer proteins is their high isoelectric point (pI) showing them as highly basic [1] . Lactobacillus acidophilus is one of the major species found in human intestines and some strains have probiotic characteristics making them GRAS (generally recognized as safe). Probiotics are live microorganisms, usually contained in food, traditionally regarded as safe for human consume that, when ingested in sufficient number, play an important role in control of the host intestinal microbiota and in the modulation of the host immune response. L. acidophilus ATCC4356 has been described as a probiotic strain [2] with a 45 kDa S-layer protein highly basic with a calculated pI of 9.59, (Expasy) that was recently showed to have an antibacterial endopeptidase activity [3, 4] . S-layers have also been considered to function as protective coats, maintenance of cell shape and ion exchangers and be involved in adhesion to biotic and abiotic surfaces [5, 6] . Although many studies focus on the structure of the S-layer, their biological functions remains poorly understood. S-layer would account for the probiotic properties of some strains [7] being capable of influencing the immune response [8] and favoring cell adhesion [9] [10] [11] [12] . Several reports have involved the S-layer proteins in the enteric pathogen exclusion phenomena [13, 14] .",

            "text": "In the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT)L. acidophilus regularly encounters many antigens presenting cell, such as dendritic cells (DCs) [15] . These cells express DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin protein (DC-SIGN), which is a cell-surface receptor, that is express mainly in DCs and recognize mannose and fructose glycans that are present on microbial and viral surfaces. DCs play a very important role in the innate and adaptive immune response [16] . It has been shown that DC-SIGN can act enhancing viral entry of different viruses such as HIV type 1, hepatitis C, Ebola, Dengue and SARS [17] [18] [19] . It was also shown that DCs interact with L. acidophilus; this contact involve the DC-SIGN and the S-layer presented on the bacterial cell-envelope, and regulates the induction of a number of cytokines involved in cellular immune regulation [8, 20] . JUNV, a New World arenavirus, is the etiological agent of the Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF) [21] , and endemo-epidemic disease that causes hemorrhagic and neurological complications. AHF presents mortality rates from 20-30% and mainly affects population on the fertile farming land of Argentina [22] . It has been shown that JUNV uses the human transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) to infect human cells [23] . In addition to its primary receptor (TfR1), JUNV virus infection was shown to be enhanced by C-type lectins (Martinez & Candurra, unpublished results). Among the C-type lectins DC-SIGN and the Liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN) were studied. DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are human homologs, share 77% of the amino-acid sequence and has function similarities. The role of these receptors (DC-and L-SIGN) in the infection of several major importance viruses placed them as a target for antiviral agents. The most common compounds used so far are carbohydrate-binding agents that can interact with the glycoprotein present on the virus surface and prevent the infection [24] .",

The repeated sequences are a general theme for protein-carbohydrate interaction described for extracellular virulence factors of Gram positive bacteria [29] . SlpA protein sequence launched in CDART showed that the C-terminal part, Domain SLAP pfam03217, aligned with structural homology with putative CBD of a subgroup of bacterial protein homologous C-type lectin-like (CLECT or CTLD domain), protein domains homologous to the carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) of the C-type lectins (CLECT cd03603 and CLECT_VCBS cd00037) however bacterial CTLDs within this group are functionally uncharacterized. When only the amino-acid sequence of SLAP pfam03217 domain (127 aa C-terminal portion) was used as query for SMART analysis two internal repeats not previously revealed with the whole protein sequence, because they overlap with pfam domain, were actually found with good accuracy (E-value 3.43e -05 ). The two internal repeats showed 33% identity (Table 2 ). Total number of positively charged residues (Arg + Lys) within the repeats gives a predicted pI of 9.26 and 9.90 for each sequence and supports the carbohydrate binding capacity suggested (Table 2) . When using I-TASSER for 3D structure and function prediction, result obtained showed similarity to Ca 2+ binding protein. The Consensus Prediction of Gene Ontology terms obtain include functions of cell adhesion, protein binding and surface expression (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/output/S97651). In summary these analyses results suggest that the S-layer of L. acidophilus is predicted to have a carbohydrate binding capacity.",

Post infection treatments with S-layer did not have an effect in viral infection, leading to the idea that the inhibition caused by S-layer was due to an early effect during viral replication cycle.

Vero cells were transfected with plasmids encoding hDC-SIGN or hL-SIGN. 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with S-layer (400 lg/ml), mannan (100 lg/ml) or left untreated (control) and then infected with JUNV (m.o.i. = 1).

It is interesting to remark that this novel mechanism of interaction between SlpA that lacks glycan strands and the DC-SIGN resembles the interaction between non glycosylated C-type animal lectins with their ligands, for example galectin-1 protein [32] . This family of soluble proteins displays conserved CRD that recognizes glycans in its glycoprotein ligand. The repeating sequences described in SlpA (Table 2 ) are a general theme for protein-carbohydrate interaction [29] and the S-layer protein is proposed to interact with carbohydrate moieties in a calcium dependant manner. DC-SIGN has been shown to determine susceptibility to HIV type 1, hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, Dengue virus and SARS coronavirus [17] [18] [19] . The results obtained in this in vitro model, suggest that S-layer could also inhibit these viruses that use DC-SIGN for viral entry.",
