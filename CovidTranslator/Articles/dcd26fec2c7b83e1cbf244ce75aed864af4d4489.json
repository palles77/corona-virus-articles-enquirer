Results: Both the high-CCL2-producing GG genotype and the low-MBL-producing B allele were consistently associated with increased risks of SARS-CoV infection in all 4 caseecontrol populations (joint P Z 1.6 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 and 4.9 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 , for CCL2 and MBL respectively), with no interaction between polymorphisms could be detected. Furthermore, all the 4 caseecontrol studies demonstrated a cumulative effect on risk of SARS-CoV infection for the combination of polymorphisms (joint P Z 1.3 \u00c2 10 \u00c010 ). However, tests using the area under the curve (AUC) indicated that at this stage, the polymorphisms were unlikely to be appropriate for risk prediction testing because of low AUC values (all <66%). Additionally, no association was observed between the polymorphisms and severity of SARS. Conclusions: The CCL2 G-2518A and MBL codon 54 variant have a significantly cumulative effect on increased risk of SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "Chemokines play important role in cells trafficking during immune responses. Among the chemokine family, the chemokine (CeC motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), also designated as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), is known as a potent chemoattractant for monocytes and macrophages, and is considered to be involved in several diseases characterized by intense macrophage infiltration. 12 CCL2 influences both innate immunity, through effects on monocytes and macrophages, and adaptive immunity, through control of T helper cell polarization. 13 In the case of SARS, our and other studies have shown that CCL2 was one of the earliest and most prominent chemokines upregulated in either lung epithelial cells or monocyte derived dendritic cells infected with SARS-CoV. 14, 15 The upregulation of CCL2 mediate the migration of monocytes and macrophages, which were the infiltrating cells indeed observed in the lung tissues of patients with SARS. 16 Notably, the overexpression of CCL2 was consistently detected in plasma of patients with SARS in several independent studies. 17\u00c019 Furthermore, after treatment with corticosteroid, which is an effective cytokine modulator and has a beneficial effect on SARS patients, the level of plasma CCL2 was reduced significantly from 5 to 8 days. 17 Additionally, it has also been reported that the higher level of serum CCL2 in patients is correlated with more advanced disease severity of SARS. 17 In the lungs of BALB/c mice, the PDZbinding motif of recombinant SARS-CoV envelope protein is a determinant of viral pathogenesis and induces the deleterious exacerbated immune response including increased expression of CCL2. 20 On the basis of the above relevance of the CCL2 in the pathogenesis of SARS, we hypothesize that the CCL2 may be the excellent biologic candidate susceptibility gene for SARS. It is expected that the genetic variation within CCL2 could contribute to inter-individual differences in susceptibility to, and outcome of SARS.",

Indeed, several lines of evidence have indicated that CCL2 secretion is upregulated during the development of SARS and correlates with intensifying immuno-mediated damage to the lungs and other target organs, resulting in acute lung injury and, subsequently, multi-organ dysfunction. 38 Therefore, we speculate that the high-CCL2-producing GG genotype may enhance the inflammation and associate with more severe clinical outcomes of SARS. However, we did not find a genetic association between CCL2 polymorphism and admission to intensive care units or deaths due to SARS. This result may be due to the limited number of patients with severe SARS or died from SARS in the present study. For example, as for disease severity this study has merely powers of 14.6% (two-sided test of significance, a Z 0.05) to detect ORs of >1.66 in Beijing community, and 9.5% to detect ORs of <0.73 in Hong Kong population, for carriers of the GG genotype relative to the carriers of the AA plus AG genotypes at the position \u00c02518 of the CCL2 gene (Supplementary Table 3 ). In contrast, as for SARS-CoV infection this study has powers of 56.2% to detect ORs of >1.41, and 82.7% to detect ORs of >1.57, in Beijing community and Hong Kong populations, respectively, for the same SNP (Table 1) .

            "text": "Interestingly, a significant cumulative effect on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection was observed for the combination of two functional SNPs in CCL2 and MBL across the four independent caseecontrol series (P trend Z 1.3 \u00c2 10 \u00c010 in the pooled samples). We estimated that individuals who have both of the at-risk genotypes have an odds ratio of 2.88 for SARS-CoV infection (Table 2) . Therefore, PAFs can be calculated to be 14.6% for CCL2, 21.9% for MBL, and 28.5% for both in the pooled samples, indicating that, for example, 28.5% of the increase in the risk of SARS-CoV infection can be attributed to carrying 1 or 2 at-risk genotypes of the two polymorphisms. If the associations are real, then at-risk genotypes of the two polymorphisms are associated with a low to moderate fraction of SARS-CoV infection among Chinese, suggesting that there exist unrevealed genes conferring susceptibility to such an infection. In fact, previous reports have shown that polymorphisms of several genes affect an individual's susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection or disease severity of SARS, 3\u00c010 although most of these susceptibility genes need to be confirmed in independent sample sets. In addition, it is notable that at this stage, CCL2 G-2518A and MBL codon 54 variant (A/B) are unlikely to be appropriate for risk prediction testing individually or in combination, because of low AUCs (53.7% for CCL2, 55.5% for MBL, and 57.0% for both) in pooled population. However, as further susceptibility polymorphisms are identified and confirmed, and interaction effects among such polymorphisms together with other risk factors are taken into account, prediction of the susceptibility of SARS-CoV infection may become more accurate and clinically usable.",

First, the small sample size of subjects homozygous for the minor allele B of MBL codon 54 variant (A/B) did not allow calculation of separate ORs for the BB genotype (the genotype with the greatest risk). Second, the small sample sizes likely meant that there was low power to detect genetic interaction between polymorphisms. Third, the small sample sizes of the two new caseecontrol populations (Beijing HCW and Tianjin) meant that the effect estimates for these groups were larger in magnitude and had wider CIs (that is, they were less stable as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 ) than the effect estimates generated from the other two larger caseecontrol populations. Last, there was no adjustment for co-morbid conditions (such as chronic diseases) that could affect susceptibility to SARS.",

            "text": "In summary, our findings indicate that individuals who are genetically predisposed to produce greater amounts of CCL2 protein seem to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. We also confirmed our previous findings that low-MBL-producing allele is a susceptibility factor for the acquisition of SARS. Furthermore, a combination of CCL2 and MBL polymorphisms has a stronger genetic association with the susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection. However, 1) no interaction between polymorphisms could be detected; 2) no association was observed between the polymorphisms and severity of SARS; and 3) although there were statistically significant associations between the two polymorphisms and SARS-CoV infection, tests using the AUC curve do not indicate that the at-risk genotypes have clinical usefulness (that is, the at-risk genotypes cannot discriminate cases from controls). Since both the CCL2 and MBL are important components in innate immunity system, our findings further support the hypothesis that variability in the innate immune response can be involved in susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection during the vulnerable period before the production of specific antibodies. 9 ",
