Their acceptance of uncertainty suggests that policy makers should be open about the limits of knowledge in potentially threatening situations.

Communication has been recognized as a critical part of PI planning. Authorities including the World Health Organisation (WHO) have issued guidelines, claiming that communication expertise is as important as epidemiological and laboratory expertise for control of outbreaks. 1 Specific PI-related communication strategies in national PI plans 2 are complemented by a burgeoning literature on risk communication, [3] [4] [5] together with analyses of communication in previous crises such as the 2003 outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 6, 7 and Hurricane Katrina. 8, 9 There is growing consensus about principles of risk and crisis communication, embracing concepts such as trustworthiness, transparency, responsiveness, respect, candour and practicality. 1, 10, 11 This literature provides a foundation for governments developing their own PI communication strategies, such as the Communication Strategy Overview 12 published as an annex to the Australian government\u00d5s Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza. 13 There is, however, an additional source of expertise that can contribute to pandemic communication planning: the public. Their views can be accessed in a variety of ways, each with strengths and weaknesses. 14 Deliberative forums are one method of tapping into the community to explore approaches to an issue or problem. 15 Deliberative methods provide opportunities for citizens to articulate and share values. 15, 16 Forums are similar to citizens\u00d5 juries in that a population sample deliberates about an issue after receiving expert information. 17 Like juries, forums share the theoretical assumption that, given enough information about a topic, a small group can provide views that are informed and reflective of community values.",

The influenza virus is now widespread throughout most major capital and regional centres in Australia. What information should the public receive about PI? Scenario 1: Before a pandemic (see Box 1) Participants were surprised at their lack of knowledge or awareness of H5N1 and the potential for PI. They recommended three topics of public information for this phase: the current situation and its implications; information about PI; and information about seasonal influenza: \u2026not many people are aware of the situa-tion\u2026and, for example, I could ask my three children a bit about the bird flu and how aware they are of that in other countries, and I\u00d5m sure they couldn\u00d5t give me much of an answer.

These objectives are supported by the literature on information strategies to effect behaviour change 4,11 and reduce public anxiety and criticism. 10 There are, however, some notable differences. First, the forum wanted full and frank information about the potential risk and international developments including numbers of cases and fatalities. It is not clear whether the Stage 1 key message \u00d4What is the current disease situa-tion\u00d5 anticipates this level of detail. Given the level of prior knowledge amongst participants, either such detail is not planned, or the strategy to date has been unsuccessful. 19 There is evidence that people do want the truth during a crisis, even if this is bleak. 10 Providing information about the potentially deadly nature of an infection increases concern in the population which is associated with taking precautions to protect against infection. 20 Second, although forum members understood that predictions about PI were uncertain, this did not lead to loss of confidence in the experts or the information they imparted. This is consistent with findings that acknowledging uncertainty can increase public confidence. 21 Information about communicating uncertainty is currently absent from the Strategy.",

Our forum was composed of randomly selected participants, who were provided with information that they were encouraged to discuss before reaching their recommendations. In these aspects, it resembled a citizens\u00d5 jury. There were however, differences. Our forum was asked for their views about communication needs, rather than asked to choose or prioritize amongst options as commonly occurs with juries. In addition, the forum did not deliberate in private to reach ordered or unanimous recommendations. This decision was partly pragmatic as PI communication is a broad topic for which there is little hard evidence about effective strategies. It was also influenced by our desire to seek the maximum information possible given the relative expense of staging a forum. At times, it was difficult for the forum to remain focussed on the questions, leading to recommendations less clear cut than, for example, ordering a set of healthcare priorities. Members of the forum were very curious about PI leading to an occasional blurring of the distinction between their requests for information (as forum members) and their views about information recommended for the public. A more formal process would have avoided this problem; however, this may have been at risk of losing some of the range of views expressed.",
