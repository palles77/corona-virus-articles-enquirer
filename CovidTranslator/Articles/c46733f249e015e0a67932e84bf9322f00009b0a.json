[1] [2] [3] Rapid diagnostic tests are of little value without subsequent antibiotic deescalation when indicated. 4 Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) can help achieve these outcomes by acting as active messengers and educators for medical teams. 4, 5 The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of real-time pharmacy intervention on antibiotic deescalation based on DRP results.",

Further studies are needed to explore the reasons behind failure to deescalate antibiotics despite the availability of DRP results with ASP interpretation. Although rapid diagnostic testing with realtime ASP interpretation and intervention is very promising, the best use of ASP personnel in the reporting and interpretation of these tests remains to be determined.
