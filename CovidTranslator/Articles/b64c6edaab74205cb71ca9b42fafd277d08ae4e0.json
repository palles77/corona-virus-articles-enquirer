Although this may be an Orwellian, intrusive system, a similar voluntary surveillance system already exists for BioFire users and could have value in future epidemiologic outbreak identification. 3 Rather than continuing to chase outbreaks after the fact, earlier crowd sharing of silent surveillance data could serve the entire community while not sounding an alarm on a sporadic false-positive result.

One study has already demonstrated the value of detecting C cayetanensis directly from stool specimens during an outbreak. 7 Despite this prevalence and clinical/epidemiologic significance, the target has been excluded from multiple panels in favor of E histolytica (see Tables 3 and 4) . Although E histolytica is a virulent protozoal pathogen, its incidence is very low in developed countries. In this author's laboratory, Cyclospora is the most frequently detected protozoal pathogen and E histolytica ranks fifth of the 5 protozoa detected by a syndromic panel. Furthermore, some commercial assays are not able to specifically identify E histolytica from the nonpathogenic Entamoeba dispar.

Organisms such as Shigella, Salmonella, and Campylobacter are currently cultured after syndromic testing in efforts to maintain public health outbreak tracking, but also to provide primary antimicrobial susceptibility testing for selected drug classes in cases of severe infection. 9,10 These organisms often are not culturable after primary syndromic testing, so having markers for macrolide, quinolone, and/or tetracycline resistance could be extremely helpful for treating clinicians and epidemiologic reporting. 11 Clearly this is a technically challenging request and one that may be more idealistic than realistic given current technologies, but should nonetheless be a future target goal for testing.",

For starters, whole blood syndromic testing is an adjunct to conventional blood cultures and manufacturers must consider the pediatric population and associated blood volume limitations. A requirement of less than 1 mL of blood in children would be optimal. Second, the targets incorporated must be analogous to the aforementioned direct from positive blood culture panels. Preferably, a compendious list of bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens should be offered, without compromising the sensitivity of the test. The ability to detect polymicrobial infections despite low pathogen load is paramount for appropriate antimicrobial coverage. Importantly, the breadth of targets and high sensitivity will allow for high confidence in a negative result to potentially decrease antimicrobial use.

The development of a diagnostic algorithm that integrates host response as a predicate of whole blood syndromic testing may be a potential strategy to distinguish low risk patients from septic patients.

CSF lactate may be a promising marker to rule out bacterial meningitis with high sensitivity (93%-95%) and specificity (95%-96%), 24 albeit a significant decrease in sensitivity is noted with antibiotic exposure. 24 A recent proof-of-concept study using the Luminex FlexMPA 3D technology determined that quantification of cytokine levels in the CSF can rule in or out an infectious process. Specifically, high levels of IP-10/CXCL10 were present in CNS infections and MDC/CCL22 levels were significantly higher in nonviral infections. Deciphering between oncologic process and autoimmune encephalitis may also be possible, as indicated by high levels of GRO/CXCL1, IL-7, and IL-8 in gliomas. 25 A potential steward of diagnostic testing would include screening for infectious processes by cytokine profiling followed by subsequent testing with syndromic panel.

            "text": "Inclusions of potential resistance markers and/or direct from specimen phenotypic susceptibility may be beneficial for some CNS pathogens including, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and E coli K1. One example is to establish H influenzae antimicrobial profile as beta-lactamase positive, beta-lactamase negative ampicillin susceptible, and beta-lactamase positive ampicillin resistant by the detection of such genes as TEM-1, ROB-1, and PBP3. 26 In line with potential assays for shunt infections, inclusion of mecA and mecC gene for detection of methicillin resistance in S aureus is beneficial. An idealistic request is to develop direct from positive CSF specimen phenotypic susceptibility testing. Future development may consider either a standalone identification and susceptibility testing platform or in collaboration with existing identification platforms to consolidate the susceptibility portion.",
