Concomitant with this rapid growth and expansion of BEs, there is also a quest to maintain and protect the well-being of indoor occupants. Individuals in BEs co-exist with a myriad of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and microbial parasites such as mites.

However, recent efforts have begun to unravel the indoor microbiome as a whole, examining the different effects of indoor environments on the community with broader and greater ecological focuses. Recent advances in culture-independent highthroughput sequencing have further catalyzed the bloom in indoor microbiome investigations, allowing the detection of hundreds and thousands of microbial species in a single indoor air or surface sample. As a result of high-throughput sequencing, the research community now appreciates that the breadth of microbial diversity within BEs are several orders of magnitude higher than previously reported using culture-dependent methods. 1 In addition, while earlier phylogenetic marker gene-based targeted sequencing studies have identified the microbial community members within BEs, studies using shotgun metagenomics sequencing have further surveyed the functional potentials of a microbial community, thus enabling one to gain new insights into metabolic, virulence, and resistance potentials of the air microbiome. 2, 3 More recent efforts have also linked microbial communities and chemical compositions detected in various indoor environments, in attempts to detect relationships between microbiome and potential microbial metabolites and other chemicals present in BEs. 3 Given the rapid development in BE microbiome research, an overview regarding the past and current state of research is timely and warranted. Therefore, in this chapter, the importance of understanding the indoor microbiome from an ecological, environmental, and clinical perspective will be discussed. This will be followed by a brief historical account of BE microbiology, describing the earliest works looking at microorganisms in indoor settings. A description of some of the common contemporary methods applied to study the indoor microbiome, from sampling to data analysis, will also be provided. Different compartments of the indoor microbiome, such as air-, surface-, and dust-associated microbial communities, as well as building designs and other factors that may be important in driving differences in the BE microbiome will be summarized. While most of the current BE microbiome works using high-throughput sequencing pertain to bacteria and fungi, studies involving other members of microbial life will also be briefly discussed. The subsequent description of the transmission of microbiomes within the BE, including the risk of pathogens and their spread within BEs, will underscore the importance of understanding the BE microbiome. Finally, future outlooks in BE microbiome research will be presented.",

These building properties can shape distinct microbiomes in similar BEs. The core BE microbiome in general consisted of microorganisms with outdoor environmental origins, as well as contributions coming from indoor occupants such as humans and pets. Moreover, activities of occupants may also play major roles in shaping the BE microbiome. 4, 6, 7 In addition, depending on the operational function and purpose of the BE (from single-family residential buildings to commercial buildings), building characteristics and indoor environmental factors including temperature, humidity, and airflow rates (as controlled, for example by a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system) are adjusted to maximize occupant comfort. These factors are associated with changes in indoor microbial communities, but their roles may be modest compared to that of BE design, occupancy, and outdoor influences, depending on the BE (see Section 6.08.6).",

Microbiologists typically were able to cultivate common occupant-associated bacteria including species of Staphylococcus as well as environmental members including Bacillus. 8 However, culture-dependent methods inherently present numerous limitations in BE microbiome research. Firstly, only a small fraction of naturally occurring microorganisms can be cultivated in laboratory growth conditions. Hence, the microbial diversity obtained from culture-dependent methods has been greatly underrepresented. Indeed, studies that include both culture-dependent and culture-independent works unanimously highlight the extended microbial diversity detected via cultureindependent methods, including the identification of potentially pathogenic species, which were otherwise undetected using culture-dependent methods. 8, 9 Lee et al. 8 also uncovered a much wider range of bacterial diversity in a daycare facility using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, and most of these bacterial species were not detected when the same samples were cultivated. Notably, through 16S clone sequencing, the authors have established that pseudomonads were considered to be a core group of microorganisms in the childcare facility, even when members of this group were only sporadically detected on agar plates.",

With the advent of pyrosequencing, an increased number of BE microbiome studies had been conducted, and these previous works gave scientists early insights into the effects of building design, occupants and their activities, geography, climate, and time on indoor bacterial and fungal communities. 1, 4 While pyrosequencing was the preferred sequencing method of choice for a period of time since its introduction, pyrosequencing has lost its competitiveness to Illumina sequencing (because of its increased sequencing depth and hence reduced cost per nucleotide), which is currently the most commonly used sequencing platform for microbiome analysis. Illumina sequencing is the current sequencing platform of choice for analyzing the BE microbiome, especially when shotgun metagenomics sequencing is employed. [2] [3] [4] More recently, third-generation highthroughput sequencing platforms, such as the Pacific Biosciences and the Oxford Nanopore technologies, allow for longer read length (comparable to those offered by Sanger sequencing, making full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing possible, see Section 6.08.4.3), thereby potentially enabling more accurate and specific identification and community analyses of BE microorganisms.",

In addition to a few ubiquitous species, most environmental microorganisms encountered indoor are confined to a specific location of the building. In other words, it is less likely for two BEs in close proximity to harbor identical airborne microorganisms of environmental origins. This is primarily due to differences in microbial community of outdoor air, which has been predicted by source-tracking analysis as a major source of indoor airborne microorganisms across a wide range of BEs such as dwellings, classrooms, offices, and public transit. 4, 16 Having said that, there may exist a \"core indoor microbiome\" across building types, including taxa belonging to genera commonly associated with occupants and those that may be pathogenic. 17 The dispersal of outdoor microorganisms may be regulated by the mode of ventilation applied in BEs. In a previous hospital study, chloroplast DNA was found to be significantly less abundant in the air of mechanically ventilated rooms than those that were naturally ventilated, which was thought to be removed by the filters of mechanical systems. 18 In addition to the migration of outdoor air, some indoor pathways and reservoirs may affect the load of airborne microorganisms in BEs. Human occupants emit microorganisms predominantly from the skin, and occupants have long been recognized as a major source of indoor airborne microorganisms. 6 The emitted microorganisms not only increase the microbial load, but also affect the composition of airborne microbial community. Common inhabitants of various parts of the human body can be detected in BEs. 4 Moreover, the indoor space was imprinted with a personalized microbial cloud which could be used to predict the occupancy of specific human hosts. 1 However, when the indoor space was well ventilated and sparsely occupied, the indoor airborne microbial community closely mirrored outdoor air, with modest microbial signature from human body. 4, 16 These results suggest that the contribution of outdoor air and human occupants to indoor air microbiome is associated with the occupancy density and frequency and ventilation strategy.",

The results suggest that the deposition rate of all particle sizes (0.5-10 mm) increased with increasing air speed (5-19 cms \u00c01 ), with larger particles showing greater effects than smaller ones. In addition, at a given airflow speed, the deposition loss-rate coefficient (this term is defined as the number of particles depositing on the total surface available for deposition per unit time, and is expressed in units of s \u00c01 ) increased with particles size (i.e., larger particles are more likely to deposit compared to smaller particles).

In most BEs, microorganisms in dust are considered to be mainly dispersed from outdoor air, as the surfaces where dust deposits are unlikely to be cleaned frequently and/or are in little or no direct contact with human occupants. Indeed, indoor dust harbors abundant microorganisms of soil and plant origin, with microbial community composition varying upon changes in the local outdoor microbial reservoir. Hence, it is expected that the indoor dust microbial community is largely shaped by outdoor environmental conditions when a large geographic scale is considered. Consistent with this expectation, a global survey of household dust reported that phylogenetically distinct fungal communities were identified for each region, and the fungal communities in temperate zones were more diverse than those in the tropics. 22 Within a smaller geographic scale, the seasonality pattern may be reflected in the dynamics of indoor dust microbial community when a long time scale is considered.",

Thus, the influence of outdoor microorganisms on indoor microbiomes is expected to vary according to the ventilation strategy adopted in the BEs. Consistent with this, airborne bacterial communities in naturally ventilated rooms resembled adjacent outdoor air, while distinct microbial community was found in rooms with mechanical ventilation. In addition, mechanically ventilated rooms harbored less diverse microbial communities than naturally ventilated rooms. 6 Similar to indoor air, the type of ventilation was also shown to affect the structure of indoor dust microbiome. However, it is worth noting that an improperly maintained ventilation system can serve as an amplification and dissemination site for microbial pathogens. 16 Overall, ventilation plays a crucial role in shaping the diversity and composition of indoor microbiome, and regular maintenance (i.e., cleaning practices) is required to improve the air quality of BEs.",

Since outdoor environments are a major source of microorganisms encountered indoors, the indoor microbial community is largely shaped by geography and location. Thus, distinct microbial community and/or indigenous species were identified for BEs from geographically different areas. 6 In addition to the geography pattern, the influence of landuse and urbanization degree on indoor microbiome is also evident. Dwellings in rural areas generally harbored abundant microorganisms of environmental origin due to the high exposure to green area (e.g., forest and farmland). Likewise, in urban regions, the composition of airborne bacterial community of outdoor BEs (e.g., parking space) was also affected by the nearby vegetation. However, urbanization generally reduced the indoor exposure to environmental microorganisms, and the indoor microbial community in more urbanized regions tended to be more homogenous. 25 6.08.6.6 Climate Climate plays a crucial role in regulating the richness and evenness of microbial communities in outdoor environments. Generally, warm temperatures in summer are associated with aerosolization of bacteria from soils, plants, and water sources, whereas these bacteria of environmental sources tend to be rare or absent in outdoor air during winter. Given the importance of outdoor microorganisms on indoor microbial community, significant pattern of seasonality was also detected indoors according to a previous time-series study (see Section 6.08.5.3). Although seasonal changes in meteorological factors can be buffered by the building envelops, the relative humidity of a single indoor space may vary largely within a short period of time due to human activities (e.g., shower in bathroom) and weather conditions (e.g., rainstorm). As indoor temperature is generally controlled at 15-30 C, the growth rate of many microorganisms, especially fungal species, can be dramatically increased when relative humidity is elevated. BEs with serious moisture issue such as water-damaged homes are usually associated with the growth of visible molds, which can affect the composition of indoor airborne microbial community, and has been shown to induce health problems. 19 In addition to seasonal climatic changes, the BE microbiome is also subjected to occasional severe adverse weather conditions, resulting in alterations of the microbial communities that can persist for months after the onset of events. 2 ",

More recently, using a fluorescence-based and particle-counting bioaerosol sensor, a hospital-based study demonstrated the potential for dispersion of particle-associated microorganisms from various textiles used in patient rooms across the hospital. 29 The authors reported that bacteria (some of which may be pathogens) presumably associated with hospital patients and personnel can be spread across multiple floors and be detected in textile holding rooms with minimal occupancy, suggesting that the spread of pathogens into a BE may not need to directly involve occupants. These studies also highlight the need for potential changes in building operation to prevent transmission of pathogens within BEs, such as increase of air circulation in the therapy pool environment 9 or additional personal protective equipment when handling hospital gowns and linens. 29 A pre-requisite for host occupant infection is the survival of pathogens within the BE. Indeed, human pathogens grown in planktonic conditions showed reduced viability when inoculated onto BE surfaces, with a survival time on BE surfaces of less than a month. 30 However, organisms present on indoor surfaces may survive in the form of a biofilm, and laboratory assessments of viability of microorganisms within biofilms may be more appropriate. In the study of Marks et al., 30 they inoculated and compared the viability of streptococci on plastic and hand surfaces following planktonic or biofilm growth in the laboratory. Biofilm cells remained viable on surfaces for extended periods of time compared to their planktonic counterparts, and biofilm cells were able to colonize the upper respiratory tracts of mice even after a month of being inoculated onto BE surfaces. Organisms directly collected from the indoor surfaces can also be cultivated, and can potentially resist antimicrobials, and subsequently transmit from one individual to others indirectly through survival on indoor surfaces. 2 In addition to the spread of pathogens, building scientists and health professionals can also assess whether selective pressures imposed by occupants induce an effect on the BE microbiome (e.g., use of antimicrobial chemicals). Hartmann et al. 3 found that the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes was positively correlated with the application dose of specific antimicrobial chemicals within BEs. However, the authors were not able to correlate structural dissimilarities of the investigated indoor dust microbiomes with the applications of antimicrobials in the corresponding BEs. Additional studies will be required to provide a mechanistic explanation for the association between the concentrations of antimicrobial chemicals and relative abundances of resistance genes in the BEs.",

Recent advances in molecular microbiology technologies now enable us to obtain high-depth-resolution profiling of microbial communities in terms of composition, structure and function. For example, while previous clone library-based analyses provide functional potential profiles of the microbial community in and around BEs at limited depths, recent metagenomics analyses allow BE scientists to directly answer questions related to microbial virulence and resistance potentials within BEs, species-and strain-level classification of BE microorganisms and their potential sources, and various aspects of BE that may affect microbial functional profiles. 2,3-Metagenomic sequencing also allows in-depth analysis of the microbiome consisting of organisms other than bacteria or fungi, such as the BE viral community. In addition, advances of sequencing technology platforms have pushed the development of new and improved bioinformatic tools that may allow for more meaningful analyses of the BE microbiome. For instance, the inherent low-biomass nature associated with some BEs have been met with benchmarking works 4, 17 in order to maximize the biomass yield, while minimizing erroneous and contaminating sequences that may otherwise take up a large proportion of sequencing data.",

While RNA-based studies looking at the viable microbial communities have been performed in other ecosystems, existing works attempting to understand the viable components of the BE microbiome are limited to fluorescent dye methods, which only allow the screening of non-active cells with a damaged cell membrane. 12 Recently, Gomez-Silvan et al. 12 assessed the viable portion of the residential air and surface microbiome via rRNA sequencing, which may be a more direct assessment of viability compared to methods based on cell membrane integrity. Adopting an optimized protocol for RNA isolation and preservation, the authors revealed that the viable components of the residential microbiome differ greatly from the total genetic pool of the same BE, and a sizable portion of the BE microbiome as determined by DNA methods may not represent viable organisms. However, due to differences in correlations between metabolic activity and rRNA levels, 12 careful interpretation of cellular activity using rRNA data is warranted. Nonetheless, additional BE studies focusing on viable components of the microbiome using rRNA sequencing is anticipated.",

These special buildings, with careful consideration of building use, geographical, and climatic factors, utilize specific innovative designs to minimize energy consumption while maximizing occupant comfort. Given our understanding of how building designs may affect the indoor microbiome, it is unclear whether the use of these energy-efficient BE designs may also affect the microbial communities of these buildings. Leung and colleagues reveal that a low-occupancy ZCB in Hong Kong presented air microbiome resembling that of other BE studies. 16 Specifically, the majority of the ZCB air microbiome consisted of taxa commonly associated with the outdoor environment, with a more modest influence from taxa associated with occupant skin. Although several studies reported similar relationships between occupant, environment, and BE regardless of green building certification, it is unknown whether these studies are representative of BEs around the world, as each BE is dependent on social, cultural, regulatory, and climatic considerations that are specific to the location of the BE. 16 Therefore, additional focus is required to gain insights into microbial exposures of occupants in energy-efficient buildings to provide a more comprehensive view of the energy-efficient building microbiome.",
