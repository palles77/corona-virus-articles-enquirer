These procedures should not occur in forensic cases as they may produce postmortem artefact or injury, which is sometimes difficult to interpret at a later stage. Occasionally, a case which initially seems straightforward and will evolve under further investigation to be more complex and as such may require more detailed forensic examination.

Care should be taken both in preparing for and during transport. When stabilizing stretchers and bodies in bags or in vehicles, care must be taken not to crush the fragile tissue. Elastic ties or 'seatbelts' may be used in place of more rigid-type stabilizers. In any case where the deceased is unrecognizable visually, establishing identity will be an important part of the investigation, and the incineration of bodies makes the identification very difficult. A commonly used method is for a forensic odontologist to compare the antemortem dental records with the teeth of the deceased person. The teeth and bones are often very brittle and fragile and often teeth may be broken or lost during transportation to the mortuary. To prevent this, the head may be photographed in situ and then wrapped in cotton wool or bubble wrap, and supported by a plastic bag or container which is secured around the neck of the deceased. Thus if the teeth are dislodged they remain contained within the bag. It is important that any body part found at the scene and not attached to the deceased is not assumed to belong to the deceased, and as such is bagged separately from the body and clearly labeled both in regards to its physical description and the specific location in which it was found, for example, 'tooth found in the vicinity of body X.' After the body is moved, the ash and debris on the floor or ground in the immediate vicinity should be carefully searched and sifted to screen for teeth, small bones, or other matter important to the case. This sifting is most appropriately done at the mortuary where lighting is optimal and suitable equipment readily available. The debris should be bagged and labeled according to the section of body immediately above it, and should be transferred to the mortuary with the deceased. It is recommended that the odontologist assists at the scene investigation to ensure the integrity and safety of the deceased person (Bassed, 2003) .",

In some cases this evidence may be the only indication of what may have occurred. It is thus important that anything attached to the body remains as such and its position preserved as best as possible. This is to ensure the items can be examined with specific relation to their position on the deceased, in connection to additional devices, and any injury it/they may have caused. In rare cases this technique can help rule out the involvement of any other person in the death. In addition, as mentioned previously, if the evidence is removed before the pathologist's examination the mode of death may be unclear. On occasion the item may have been removed on discovery of the deceased to assist with resuscitation. In this instance, care should be taken to ensure the items are bagged individually and clearly labeled for transportation. For example, in a case of hanging, the ligature should remain intact and in situ. Where the deceased is suspended, the rope should be cut away from the suspension point, leaving the knots/attachments intact. If the ligature has been removed from the neck to facilitate resuscitation, the section of the ligature originally in contact with the deceased should be reconstructed, the ends tied together with string, then bagged, labeled, and transported with the body. Where there is evidence that has legal requirements for transport, such as firearms, drugs, or volatile substances, the chain of custody of these items should be documented clearly and completely. The police or ballistics expert experienced in safe handling procedures usually transports or may offer advice in the handling of firearms and other dangerous weapons.",

Assessment of the presence and distribution of GSR on the individuals present at the scene of death can assist police with the inclusion or exclusion of suspects and assist them in determining the appropriate position of other people present at the time of the event. Ideally, this assessment should be performed as soon as possible after the incident and before the transport of the deceased (Dodd and Byrne, 2006) . In some instances this is neither practical nor timely, and it is recommended this procedure be done after the deceased is transported to the mortuary. In this situation any GSR on the deceased person must be preserved during transit. To do this, the deceased is transported in a sealed body bag, and the clothing of the deceased should remain undisturbed. In addition, paper bags are placed securely over the hands. It is essential that paper bags be used rather than plastic as the hands may sweat if contained in plastic, which can alter the presence of the GSR. MSCT scanning has proven useful in early identification of the location and number of projectiles or foreign bodies in particular where cases are visually unrecognizable due to trauma (Drummer and Cordner, 2011) . The body transporters must be aware of this as a projectile may be on the surface of the skin or in the clothing and as such there is a risk of disturbance when the body is initially moved. After the deceased is transferred on to a stretcher and removed from the scene, the immediate vicinity of the deceased is searched carefully for projectiles or spent cartridges.",

Moving a severely decomposed body can complicate this process further and if care is not taken, may result in the removal of skin or the detachment of limbs. To overcome this, rather than lifting the body on to plastic, it should be carefully rolled on to its side, and the plastic tucked underneath the deceased. The body can then be lifted using the plastic to hold the remains intact and gently placed into a body bag. Care should be taken to avoid being bitten or stung; however, fly spray or deodorizer should not be used on the body as it may interfere with toxicological and/or microbiological testing. Fluid-filled blisters, called buboes, may rupture and splash body transporters, and appropriate safety attire should be worn. It is recommended that a multidisciplinary approach to the scene investigation of the decomposed case is taken, utilizing the experience, where necessary, of both entomologists and anthropologists (Archer et al., 2005) .",

The bones are packed in paper bags either grouped or separately depending on the case. It is recommended that the skull is wrapped in cotton wool and supported by a box or container, similar to the procedure used when recovering incinerated remains. In some circumstances where some tissue is still attached to the bones, and the deceased is not completely skeletonized it may be more beneficial to slide a large board underneath the deceased and lift the remains with the board, keeping it intact for transportation. As with incinerated bodies, the soil around the deceased should be bagged, labeled, and sifted later to search for teeth, small bones, and other evidence. The advice of the forensic anthropologist in scene recovery is critical to the retrieval of all small remains and the exclusion of nonhuman skeletal elements (Archer et al., 2005; Bassed 2003 ).",

The equipment may provide vital information as to the cause of death or the circumstances immediately before death and thus it must all remain intact and accompany the deceased. This procedure presents a bulky and awkward body transfer. Ideally an expert should be present at the scene to examine the equipment, ensuring all valves are turned off, and settings are secure so as not to be accidentally altered during transit. In diving fatalities, radiography (X-ray or CT) for air embolism should be performed as soon as possible. In light of this, it is crucial that the body be transported as quickly as possible to the mortuary (Edmonds and Caruso, 2014) .",

Representatives from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or WorkSafe or similar occupational health and safety authorities may be able to offer advice on specific risks. If the contaminant cannot be identified, the case should be treated as highly toxic and maximum protection should be worn by workers. In extreme cases the body is decontaminated prior to removal. To do this, it is recommended that the body be photographed in situ, and then the clothing and property removed, bagged, and labeled. Scene workers wearing selfcontained breathing apparatus should then repeatedly hose the deceased. Generally, the fire brigade controls the scene, and only personnel trained in decontamination procedures should enter. In any case where there is suspicion of chemical contamination, a safety officer should be assigned to monitor the level of toxic fumes continually and ensure that the safety of the staff is adequate.",
