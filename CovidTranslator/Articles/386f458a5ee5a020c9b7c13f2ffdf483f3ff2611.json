Isatin derivatives display broad spectrum pharmacological properties, including cytotoxic (Reddy et al., 2012; Alcaide et al., 2012) , antibacterial (Akhaja and Raval, 2011) , antifungal (Reddy et al., 2011) , antiviral (Kang et al., 2011; Bacani et al., 2011; Sin et al., 2009) , anti-HIV (Bal et al., 2005) , and antimalarial (Hans et al., 2011) activities. The first clinically approved antiviral agent, N-methylisatin-b-thiosemicarbazone (methisazone) was active against smallpox and vaccinia viruses (Bauer, 1985) . N,N 0 -disubstituted thiosemicarbazone derivatives of isatin were inhibitory to HIV-1 replication (Teitz and Ronen, 1984) . N-methylisatin-b-thiosemicarbazone is an inhibitor of Japanese encephalitis virus infection (Sebastain et al., 2008) . The general configuration of the isatin molecule resembles that of the purines and also tryptophan and its derivatives, but there is no evidence available as to whether isatin-b-thiosemicarbazone acts as an antimetabolite to these compounds (Bauer and Sadler, 1960) . Recent studies have shown that isatin could inhibit the protease, caspase, MAO and COX-2 enzymes (Medvedev et al., 2007) .",

The worldwide market for antiviral drugs is estimated to be approximately 20 billion US dollars and is expected to grow rapidly as new therapies become available. The need for effective antiviral drugs is further emphasized by the lack of vaccines for most respiratory tract virus infections [adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the widely occurring human papilloma viruses, and herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and the vast array of hemorrhagic fever viruses (De Clercq, 2002) ]. Millions of people worldwide are affected by infectious diseases caused by viruses. Further, widespread viral resistance has renewed the interest in the quest for new antiviral agents. Earlier work could clearly define the structural requirements necessary for the retention of antiviral activity by heterocyclic thiosemicarbazone in neurovaccinia infections in mice. Viral infections primarily affect the respiratory and gastrointestinal system; epithelium, mucous membranes and endothelium of skin, mouth and genitals; lymphoid tissue, liver and other organs; and the central nervous system (Bruce et al., 2007) .",

The synthesized compounds were purified by column chromatography. All of the derivatives were characterized by FT-IR, 1 H NMR, and mass spectral data. The FT-IR spectra of the compounds revealed absorption bands in the region 1,509-1,610 cm -1 corresponding to C=N stretching bands. Absence of carbonyl (C=O) peak around 1,715 cm -1 revealed the formation of Schiff bases. The 1 H NMR spectrum of the synthesized compounds showed only one set of signals for the aromatic protons around 6.73-7.80 ppm, while the -NH of the isatin and -NH of hydrazones gave rise to two different signals in the 11-14 ppm range. The novel b-isatin aldehyde-N,N 0 -thiocarbohydrazones (4a-g) and bis-isatin (6a-e) were evaluated against various strains of DNA viruses (i.e., human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), vaccinia virus (VACV), HSV type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), acyclovir-resistant, ACV r ), VZV ( Table 1 ). The test compounds were also evaluated against several RNA viruses (i.e., VSV, coxsackie B4 virus, RSV, parainfluenza virus type 3, reovirus-1, sindbis virus and Punta Toro virus ( Table 2 ). The EC 50 was calculated as the effective concentration of compound that decreased the percentage of formazan production in compound treated, virus-infected cells to 50 % of that produced by compound-free uninfected cells. The 50 % cytostatic concentration (CC 50 ) was calculated as the concentration required to reduce cell growth by 50 %. MCC is the minimum cytotoxic concentration that causes a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology. The HEL, Vero, and HeLa cell lines used in this study were regularly monitored for mycoplasma contamination and found to be mycoplasma-free. The antiviral activity was measured for twelve isatin derivatives using a cell-protection assay. The data are recorded in Tables 1, 2 , 3, and 4. There was only moderate activity of the 4a and 4b compounds against both strains of HCMV. Although at concentrations close to their toxicity levels, no specific antiviral effects were noted with the evaluated compounds against HSV-1, (HSV-1 strain KOS), HSV-2 (HSV-2 strain G), HSV-1 (ACV resistant KOS strain), vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, coxsackie virus B4, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza-3 virus, reovirus-1, sindbis virus, and Punta Toro virus.

During the test, no significant toxic effects, such as inflammation and lesional damage (edema, erosion, and ulcer), were observed on the areas of mouse skin topically treated with test compounds. In our experiment, the body weight of the animals was not affected by the treatment with test compounds. As shown in Fig. 2a , the positive control (DMBA and TPA) group in papilloma-bearing mice appears rapidly from week 6, and reached 100 % within 10 weeks of promotion. On the other hand, treatment with compound 6c (85 nmol) along with DMBA/TPA reduced the percentage of papilloma-bearing mice to 40-70 % during weeks 10-15, and thereafter 90 % during week 18 and reached 100 % at week 20. As shown in Fig. 2b , in the positive control group, the number of papillomas per mouse formed increased rapidly after week 6 and reached 7.9 papillomas/mouse at week 20. On the other hand, mice treated with compound 6c bore only 5.1 papillomas/mouse over the period of week 20. A moderate protection is observed for the compound 6b. The percentage of papillomas increased rapidly from week 7 and reached 100 % after week 17, and in this group only 1.2, 3.9, and 6.1 papillomas were formed per mouse at 10, 15, and 20 weeks of promotion. From these results, the inhibitory effects of compound 6c on mouse two-stage carcinogenesis induced by DMBA and TPA were apparently more potent than those of compound 6b. Thus, as demonstrated above, the in vivo anti-tumor promoting activity of compound 6c showed stronger chemoprevention activity than that of compound 6b.
