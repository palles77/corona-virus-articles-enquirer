            "text": "Although vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) neurovirulence and pathogenicity in rodents have been well studied, little is known about VSV pathogenicity in non-human primates. To address this question, we measured VSV viremia, shedding, and neurovirulence in macaques. Following intranasal inoculation, macaques shed minimal recombinant VSV (rVSV) in nasal washes for 1 day post-inoculation; viremia was not detected. Following intranasal inoculation of macaques, wild type (wt) VSV, rVSV, and two rVSV-HIV vectors showed no evidence of spread to CNS tissues. However, macaques inoculated intrathalamically with wt VSV developed severe neurological disease. One of four macaques receiving rVSV developed clinical and histological signs similar to the wt group, while the remaining three macaques in this group and all of the macaques in the rVSV-HIV vector groups showed no clinical signs of disease and reduced severity of histopathology compared to the wt group. The implications of these findings for rVSV vaccine development are discussed.",

            "text": "Introduction Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a non-segmented, singlestranded, negative-sense RNA virus of the family Rhabdoviridae. Recombinant VSV (rVSV) is a promising vaccine vector because its simple genome can accommodate multiple foreign genes, it does not undergo either recombination or integration into host cell DNA, and it grows to high titers in many different cell types, facilitating vaccine manufacture. Moreover, rVSV generates potent cellular and humoral immune responses to abundantly expressed foreign antigens (for reviews, see Rose and Whitt, 2001) . Recombinant VSV-based vectors have been investigated preclinically as vaccine candidates for such infectious diseases as influenza virus (Roberts et al., 1999) , respiratory syncytial virus (Kahn et al., 2001) , measles virus (Schlereth et al., 2000 (Schlereth et al., , 2003 , papillomavirus (Reuter et al., 2002; Roberts et al., 2004) , severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (Kapadia et al., 2005) , Ebola and Marburg viruses (Jones et al., 2005) , as well as human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] (Egan et al., 2004; Rose et al., 2000 . The efficacy of rVSV vectors was demonstrated for HIV vaccine candidates when macaques immunized with rVSVs expressing SIV Gag and HIV Env proteins were protected from disease following challenge with pathogenic SIV/HIV hybrid (SHIV) 89.6P (Egan et al., 2004; . A more recent study has demonstrated enhanced immunogenicity and efficacy in macaques following a DNAprime/rVSV-boost vaccination regimen (Egan et al., 2005) . Based on these promising results, we chose to develop rVSVs expressing HIV proteins for clinical evaluation.",

A reverse genetics system allowed rescue of infectious virus from cDNA (Lawson et al., 1995; Whelan et al., 1995) . The prototypic VSV IN cDNA clone was modified to allow foreign gene expression (Schnell et al., 1996a,b) . To investigate immunogenicity and efficacy in an SHIV challenge model, separate rVSV IN vectors were engineered that encoded SIV gag and HIV env genes. To circumvent the high level of neutralizing antibodies directed against the VSV surface glycoprotein (G), rVSV vectors encoding SIV Gag and HIV Env were modified by exchanging the Indiana G gene with G genes of other vesiculovirus serotypes . Vectors incorporating heterologous glycoproteins were used to boost macaques that had been primed with G-Indiana serotype vectors (Egan et al., 2004; . Following a high dose SHIV challenge, all vaccinated macaques were able to control the infection, maintain low viral loads and normal CD4 counts, and remain free from disease 5 years post-challenge (Egan et al., 2004; .",

Transmission occurs through direct contact between infected animals, and it is thought that abrasion or scarification of skin or mucosal epithelium increases the virus's ability to infect at these sites (Letchworth et al., 1999) . Furthermore, there is evidence that biting insects may serve as vectors for VSV (Brandly and Hanson, 1957; Letchworth et al., 1999; Tesh and Johnson, 1975) .",

While encephalitis is not a feature of VSV natural infection (Letchworth et al., 1999) , VSV neurotropism and neurovirulence (NV) have been demonstrated in rodent models (Bi et al., 1995; Fournier et al., 1988; Fultz et al., 1981; Huneycutt et al., 1994; Miyoshi et al., 1971; Plakhov et al., 1995; Reiss et al., 1998; Sur et al., 2003; van den Pol et al., 2002) . Furthermore, early studies involving experimental intracerebral inoculation of rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (Olitsky et al., 1934) , horses, cattle, and sheep (Frank et al., 1945) also indicated the NV potential of VSV. Recently, Chandipura virus, a related vesiculovirus, was associated with an outbreak of encephalitis in children in India (Rao et al., 2004) , although the etiologic role of Chandipura virus in human epidemic encephalitis has been questioned (John, 2004) .",

In most cases, vaccine strains are inoculated directly into NHP brains and compared to reference controls. Clinical parameters are measured for a period of up to 30 days, at which time brain and spinal cord tissues are analyzed histologically for virus-induced lesions. The NHP NV test for yellow fever vaccine involves scoring systems for both clinical signs as well as histological lesions in CNS tissue; acceptability is based on a comparison of clinical and histological scores to those of a reference control (Levenbook et al., 1987) . Similarly, a histological lesion scoring system is used to determine acceptability of mumps vaccine lots following direct inoculation into the thalamus of NHPs (Maximova et al., 1996) .",

            "text": "The development of rVSV vaccines for human use requires appropriate attenuation to remove vector-associated pathogenesis. A previous study in mice indicated that a low dose of the tissue culture-adapted wt VSV IN San Juan isolate inoculated intranasally caused weight loss, paralysis, and death, while a similar dose of rVSV IN caused only weight loss in mice . Similarly, an rVSV IN vector encoding an influenza virus hemagglutinin gene caused a transient weight loss following intranasal (IN) inoculation of mice at higher doses (Roberts et al., 1999 ). An rVSV vector containing a truncation in G (labeled CT1) did not cause weight loss following IN inoculation of mice (Roberts et al., 1999) , indicating the ability to decrease vector pathogenicity with attenuating mutations. The well-established ability of VSV to cause NV in rodents following IN inoculation (Bi et al., 1995; Huneycutt et al., 1994; Lundh et al., 1987; Olitsky et al., 1934; Reiss et al., 1998; Sabin and Olitsky, 1937; Sur et al., 2003) and the weight loss observed in mice following IN inoculation with the rVSV IN vector (Roberts et al., , 1999 indicate that rodents are highly permissive for VSV infection. Since more than 150 rhesus macaques have been inoculated both intranasally and intramuscularly with high doses of rVSV IN vectors without adverse clinical events [(Egan et al., 2004; , and unpublished observations], we decided to assess our rVSV-HIV variants for vector-associated pathogenicity in NHPs. In three separate exploratory studies, we measured viremia, viral shedding, and neuroinvasiveness following IN inoculation and NV following intrathalamic (IT) inoculation. In each study, macaques were inoculated with 10 7 PFU of virus, which is the highest dose previously tested in preclinical NHP studies (Egan et al., 2004 (Egan et al., , 2005 . The neuroinvasiveness and NV studies were modeled on the stringent NV tests used to characterize live mumps virus and yellow fever virus vaccine preparations (Levenbook et al., 1979 (Levenbook et al., , 1987 Marchevsky et al., 2003; Maximova et al., 1996; Rubin et al., 1999; WHO, 1998) .",

Viral titers were within the range of 10 2 -10 7 PFU/g (Table 4 ). Similarly, viral genomic RNA within the range of 10 6 -10 10 copies/g was detected in the frontal cortex of all five of these macaques.

However, three of the four macaques in the wt group did have low levels (10 5 to 10 6 copies/g) of detectable viral RNA in their occipital lobes. In addition, low levels of infectious virus (56 PFU/mL) and viral genomes (5.8 \u00d7 10 5 copies/mL) were detected in the CSF of one macaque in the wt group, F22190F (Table 4 ). All other tissues and CSF from this group were negative for infectious virus and viral genomes. Viruses recovered from brain samples of macaques subjected to euthanasia by day 8 were sequenced across their entire genomes. Virus isolated from two out of four macaques in the wt group had no mutations relative to the inoculum. Of the viruses isolated from the remaining two wt-inoculated macaques, one had a single amino acid substitution in G and the other had two substitutions in L ( Table 5) . The virus isolated from the one rVSV IN macaque euthanized by day 8 was found to contain identical sequence relative to input virus (Table 5) . Taken together, these results suggest that the clinical outcomes in these macaques were caused by the input viruses rather than by selection mutants with increased NV potential.",

For each tissue section, observed lesions were noted according to relative size, number, and type (e.g., inflammatory, necrotic, perivascular, periventricular). To summarize the histological findings, the following scoring system was used to quantify the observed lesion severities: 0 = no lesions, 1 = minimal, 2 = moderate, 3 = marked, 4 = severe (Table 6 ). Macaques inoculated with PBS had only minimal to moderate areas of malacia and inflammation localized to the injection site, which indicated tissue damage resulting from the needle.

It is noteworthy that the wt VSV IN inoculated macaques generally had fewer, less severe lesions in their spinal cords than the macaques in the rVSV IN group (Fig. 3 and Table 6 ). The mean severity score for spinal cord lesions in the wt VSV IN group (Fig. 3A ) was 0.5 (minimal), while the mean score for the rVSV IN group (Fig. 3B ) was 2.7 (marked). Macaques in both HIVGag5 vector groups had spinal cord lesions that were less severe than those in the rVSV IN group, with mean severity scores of 1.0 (minimal) and 0.5 (minimal) for rVSV IN -HIVGag5 and rVSV IN -CT1-HIVGag5, respectively (Figs. 3C, D, F, and Table 6 ). These observations may have resulted from the differences in days of necropsy; that is, viruses in macaques that survived to day 21 may have had more opportunity to spread to the spinal cord than those in macaques euthanized by day 8.

In the neuroinvasiveness study, neither the wt VSV nor the rVSV vectors showed evidence of spread from nasal tissue to the CNS. Although no virus was detected in sampled brain tissues in any macaques at day 21, it is possible that replicating virus did spread to neuronal tissue proximal to the inoculation site and was simply undetectable by day 21. However, histological analysis revealed no evidence of VSV-related neuropathology in the brains of any of the macaques inoculated IN. In a separate study in rhesus macaques, rVSV IN was shed in nasal secretions and saliva at low levels following IN inoculation, and only on day 1 post-inoculation (Table 1) ; additionally, there was no evidence of viremia in these macaques at any time point after IN inoculation. Therefore, these results, as well as those from previous studies in NHP (Egan et al., 2004 (Egan et al., , 2005 , indicate an absence of vectorassociated pathogenicity and neuroinvasiveness for replicationcompetent rVSV vectors by the IN route. The low level of shedding at mucosal surfaces should not be a concern for early phase clinical trials, particularly because neither vertical nor horizontal transmission of VSV is easily achieved, either experimentally or in natural infection (Brandly and Hanson, 1957; Hanson, 1952; Reif et al., 1987; Tesh and Johnson, 1975; Webb et al., 1987) .",

Histologically, these two rVSV-HIV vectors caused lesions that were, on average, less severe and more inflammatory in nature than both the wt and rVSV IN backbone vector groups (Figs. 2 and 3, and Table 6 ); the mean brain lesion scores for the rVSV-HIV vector groups were statistically significantly lower than those of the wt group and were not statistically significantly higher than the PBS control group. The presence of the additional gene (HIV Gag) and the CT1 mutation was likely responsible for the observed attenuation of virulence.",

These results are most likely due to the fact that all of the wt inoculated macaques were euthanized at day 8, which may have been too early to allow spread to the spinal cords. The detection of replicating virus in occipital lobes and CSF in some macaques in this group (Table  4) suggested that spread of virus to the spinal cord occurred via the CSF. Since the spinal cord lesion scores in the rVSV IN and rVSV IN -HIVGag5 macaques that survived to day 21 were higher than those in the wt group (Table 6) , which were all euthanized by day 8, it apparently required more than 8 days for virus to cause spinal cord lesions. We have observed a similar phenomenon in mice inoculated intracranially with the wt and rVSV IN -CT1 viruses; the wt virus killed the mice so rapidly that their brain lesion scores were lower than those in the rVSV IN -CT1 inoculated mice that survived longer (unpublished results). It is also possible that slight variations in the inoculation procedure may have resulted in variation in the immediate distribution of the inoculum, with some macaques having increased initial contamination of the CSF with the virus and consequently increased neuropathology in sites distal to the injection site.",

            "text": "Histological evidence of neuropathology was not clearly reflected by clinical or virological parameters. For example, macaques in the rVSV IN -HIVGag5 and rVSV IN -CT1-HIV-Gag5 groups had clinical scores similar to the negative control group, and there was no detectable virus or viral RNA in tissues at day 21. However, the histological analysis of brain and spinal cord tissue indicated that productive infection had occurred in these macaques, causing lesions that were mostly minimal, but were moderate to marked in some tissues in some macaques (Table 6) . Similar results were observed in the three macaques in the rVSV IN group that survived to day 21, in which the lack of clinical signs or detectable virus did not coincide with the relatively high lesion scores in brains and spinal cords. Therefore, the histological analysis appeared to be the more sensitive means of assessing NV in this model, as is the case in NHP NV tests of yellow fever and mumps vaccines (Levenbook et al., 1987; Maximova et al., 1996; Rubin et al., 1999) . Furthermore, the viral load measurements were best suited to time points when viral replication occurred, as observed in the macaques that died or were euthanized by day 8. Based on the collective infectivity and RT-PCR data, it is clear that the wt virus and rVSV IN backbone vector replicated at early time points following inoculation and that detectable replication had ceased in all groups by day 21. Presumably, the rVSV IN -HIVGag5 and rVSV IN -CT1-HIVGag5 viruses also replicated at early time points because there was serologic evidence of viral replication (Table 2) . Although some of the macaques inoculated with rVSV IN -CT1-HIVGag5 did not raise detectable neutralizing antibodies, the virus likely was able to establish an infection at the site of inoculation. It has previously been demonstrated in mice that the rVSV IN -CT1 vector generated low levels of antibodies after a single IN inoculation and that boosting was required to achieve high levels of anti-VSV neutralizing antibodies (Roberts et al., 1999) . Subsequent studies in the NHP NV model should include sampling CNS tissues at earlier time points to more accurately measure viral replication within these tissues.",

In the case of yellow fever and mumps vaccines, both of which were originally approved under different, early regulatory standards, the vaccine strains must show a significant decrease in histopathology if the reference control is a wild type strain, or no significant increase in histopathology if the reference control is a vaccine strain. In this study, HIV vaccine candidates rVSV IN -HIVGag5 and rVSV IN -CT1-HIVGag5 generated histopathology severity scores that were not statistically different from those of the PBS group and that were statistically lower than those of the wt group. However, increased regulatory stringency and a lack of established safety record for rVSV vectors in humans as compared to such vaccines as measles, mumps, polio, and yellow fever (Arya, 2002) remain concerns for developing rVSV vectors as vaccine candidates. Therefore, we have proceeded to construct additional, further attenuated rVSV vector candidates [reviewed in Clarke et al., 2006] using such approaches as gene rearrangement (Ball et al., 1999; Flanagan et al., 2001 Flanagan et al., , 2003 Novella et al., 2004; Wertz et al., 1998) , ablation of expression of the M2 and M3 polypeptides encoded by the M gene (Jayakar and Whitt, 2002) , temperature sensitive mutations (Flamand and Pringle, 1971; Pringle, 1970) , and gene deletions or truncations (Jeetendra et al., 2003; Kahn et al., 2001; Roberts et al., 1999; Robison and Whitt, 2000) .",

In addition, the wt VSV IN caused severe clinical illness that required euthanasia of macaques inoculated IT by day 8, which complicated the comparisons to other groups in which the macaques survived to day 21.

The tissue culture-adapted San Juan isolate of VSV Indiana serotype (wt VSV IN ) was least attenuated in vitro and was highly pathogenic in mice . The rVSV IN was derived from a cDNA encoding the entire genome of VSV IN (Lawson et al., 1995) , which was constructed using RT-PCR products combined from the genomes of VSV IN , San Juan and Mudd-Summers isolates. The resulting virus contained multiple nucleotide sequence differences from the parental San Juan isolate that presumably accounted for the in vivo attenuation of rVSV IN relative to wt VSV IN . This cDNA served as the \"backbone\" vector from which the two rVSV-HIV vectors were derived. The prototypic HIV vaccine vector, rVSV IN -HIVGag5, was similar to the vectors tested previously in SHIV challenge studies in macaques , except that this vector encoded an HIV-1 Gag protein rather than an SIV Gag. Finally, the rVSV IN -CT1-HIVGag5 contained a mutant G gene that encodes a protein in which the cytoplasmic tail domain is truncated from 29 amino acids to a single amino acid (CT1); this mutation has been shown to greatly reduce vector pathogenicity in mice following IN inoculation (Roberts et al., 1999; Schnell et al., 1998) .
