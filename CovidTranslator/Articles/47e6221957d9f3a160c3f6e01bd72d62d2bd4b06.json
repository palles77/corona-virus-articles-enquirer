Various laboratory measures used in research (e.g., mucus weight, viral titer, nasal neutrophils, and cytokine assays including IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8) have major limitations, and none are part of clinical practice. The most Development methods are reported elsewhere [11] . First, WURSS was designed to reflect outcomes important to people with colds. Second, WURSS was developed as an evaluative instrument, designed to measure items and domains that change over time. Recognizing the diversity of approaches to instrument development and validation, we tend to follow the conceptual framework described by McDowell and Newell [12] and to use methods advanced by Guyatt and colleagues at McMaster [13] [14] [15] . As there is no gold standard for measuring the common cold, we chose to assess construct validity, in which evaluation of reliability, responsiveness, and importance to patients is complemented by assessment of associations with external measures, all guided by appropriate conceptual frameworks [12] .",

Using methods developed by Guyatt, Jasechke, Juniper, and Redelmeier and colleagues [13] [14] [15] 20] , we asked participants to rate their perceived global change (improvement or deterioration). First, participants were asked to select \"Better,\" \"The Same,\" or \"Worse\" in response to \"Compared to yesterday, I feel that my cold is\u2026.\" Next, they were asked to rate the degree of change using the following scale: 1, almost the same, hardly any better [ Prospectively monitored day-to-day changes on the WURSS-44 corresponding to assessments of global change of either \"a little better\" or \"somewhat better\" were use to calculate the minimal important difference (MID).

Composite construct reliability was estimated using procedures originally suggested by Joreskog [23] , with details provided by Bollen [24] . Of the 42 items used in the models, a total of 36 fit neatly within the 10 dimensions, with 2 to 10 items per dimension.

Assessment of structural stability over time was evaluated by conducting two analyses. First, the 10-dimensional model pattern was constrained to be equal in a confirmatory factor analysis and assessed at four different time periods, two days from start of the study, three days, four days, and five days, the time frame when overall severity change was greatest. The 10-dimensional structure was supported by the lack of significant change in fit indices in this temporal analysis. Finally, the data from all five days were aggregated and a confirmatory factor analysis based on the 10-dimensional structure was derived.",

Unadjusted pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficients of WURSS-44 with SF-36 were \u03ea0.42 at intake and \u03ea0.35 at exit (P \u03fd 0.01). (For the SF instruments, 100 corresponds to perfect health, with lower scores indicating worse health. For WURSS and Jackson, 0 would correspond to perfect health, with higher scores indicating worse health. Therefore, some coefficients are negative.) Comparing WURSS-44 with Jackson led to correlation coefficients ranging from 0.73 to 0.93 (P \u03fd 0.001). Comparing WURSS with SF-8 yielded correlation coefficients from \u03ea0.60 to \u03ea0.84 (P \u03fd 0.001). These associations were stronger than those between Jackson and SF-8, for which coefficients ranged from \u03ea0.55 to \u03ea0.78 (P \u03fd 0.001) (see Fig. 2) . A partial correlation analysis [27] adjusting for participant age, gender, education, income, smoking status, and illness severity as covariates yielded very similar results, overall, and over time, without indication of need for adjustment. Thus, the data supported our expectations that the WURSS-44 would display stronger associations with the illness-specific Jackson criteria and with general health quality of life instruments, than either of these would with each other. Furthermore, these associations appeared to be linear, stable over time, and not significantly affected by possible confounders.",

Means of total daily scores were in the 90s in the first days of colds, when symptoms were worst, dropping rapidly after the second day of monitoring. As noted above, WURSS scores varied proportionately with Jackson, and inversely with the SF-8 and the SF-36. Comparing retrospective assessments of global change to prospective changes reported on WURSS, a minimal important difference (MID) of 16.7 points per day was calculated for the sum total score. Dividing this estimate of small but important difference by the square root of twice the mean square error of stable patients (280.0) yields a Guyatt responsiveness index of 0.71, suggesting that a randomized trial with two arms would require 92 participants to have \u223c90% chance of detecting this level of daily change (assuming \u03b1 \u03ed 0.05 and \u03b2 \u03ed 0.10; two-tailed testing). Using identical methods, MID and responsiveness were calculated for individual items, which were then used as criteria for item reduction. (See Table 3 , and next paragraph.) Using a simply summed score, a MID of 1.56 was calculated for the Jackson scale, yielding a responsiveness index of 0.61 for the Jackson scale. This indicates that a two-armed trial would need 124 participants to detect this level of minimally important daily change. Similarly, an MID of 4.52 and a responsiveness index of 0.54 was calculated for the SF-8, indicating that an SF-8 powered RCT would need 156 participants to detect this level of daily change.",

The common cold is a syndrome characterized by abrupt onset, short but variable duration, and high diversity of symptomatic presentation. The rapid change over time precludes meaningful test-retest reliability assessments. The subjective nature precludes interpretable interobserver comparisons. The variability of symptomatic and functional presentation and course, as well as the lack of an adequate gold standard, further complicate validity testing. Currently available laboratory measures are inadequate. Upper respiratory infections may be caused by many different agents, including strains of adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, influenzavirus, parainfluenzavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and now metapneumovirus [28] , as well as the prototype rhinovirus. Even the best laboratories still fail to identify etiological agents in anywhere from 25% to 75% of colds tested [29, 30] , however. Conversely, about 25% of those with documented infections fail to develop symptoms [31] . Although nasal and throat symptoms are present in most colds, their presence doesn't assure that it is a cold (it could be, for example, allergic rhinitis, or streptococcal pharyngitis), and their absence doesn't rule out the possibility (asymptomatic infection is possible). Other cold-related symptoms, such as cough, feverishness, chilliness, or general malaise are even less sensitive and specific. Severity, duration, and symptom presentation vary greatly among different populations, partially due to variability among the many pathogens, and partially due to differences in host response. The colds in our study, for example, are longer and more severe, with more cough, fever, and aches, than those of several previous studies [2] [3] [4] 32, 33] . Clearly, we are left with a syndrome that is truly an illness (a collection of experienced symptoms) rather than a disease (defined by verifiable biological criteria), using the model first put forth by Kleinman [34] .",

Other limitations include the difficulty in recruiting a representative sample, variability in perception, understanding and response among different individuals, and the inherent difficulty in interpreting scales (indices) that are not solidly tied to universally understood reference standards. Additionally, there is considerable potential difficulty in the underlying assumption of equal distancing among the seven severity levels, in the assumptions of normal distributions, and in the assumption of equal item importance implied by our use of unity weighting.

Empirically conducted factor analysis yielded 10 dimensions that are internally coherent, and stable over time. The WURSS-44 correlates to Jackson (illnessspecific) and to the SF-8 (general health) better than these two measures correlate to each other. These correlations appear to be stable over time, and are unaffected by covariates such as gender, age, and severity at presentation. Perhaps most important, WURSS-44 demonstrates greater responsiveness than Jackson, while at the same time expanding both the measurement field and the response range. If the WURSS-21 performs as well by itself as the items embedded in the WURSS-44 appear to, it should be able to detect important change with even greater sensitivity, and with only minimal loss of content breadth.
