WT and Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells were cotransferred into Ly49H-deficient mice, whose NK cells are unable to recognize the virus-encoded glycoprotein m157 during MCMV infection and undergo clonal expansion (Sun et al., 2009) .

Previous studies have described the pleiotropic role of type I IFNs on innate and adaptive immune cells during viral infection. Here, we demonstrate that natural killer (NK) cells from mice lacking the type I IFN-\u03b1 receptor (Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 ) or STAT1 (which signals downstream of IFN AR) are defective in expansion and memory cell formation after mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Despite comparable proliferation, Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells showed diminished protection against MCMV infection and exhibited more apoptosis compared with wild-type NK cells. Furthermore, we show that Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells express increased levels of NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligands during viral infection and are susceptible to NK cell-mediated fratricide in a perforin-and NKG2D-dependent manner. Adoptive transfer of Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells into NK cell-deficient mice reverses the defect in survival and expansion. Our study reveals a novel type I IFN-dependent mechanism by which NK cells evade mechanisms of cell death after viral infection.",

IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 are members of the type I IFN family. All members of the type I IFN family signal through a ubiquitously expressed heterodimeric receptor that is composed of the IFN-\u03b1 receptor 1 (IFN AR1) and IFN AR2 chains. Type I IFNs act directly on NK cells to promote their activation, cell cycle entry, and cytotoxic function during viral infection (Biron et al., 1984; Orange and Biron, 1996; Biron, 2001; Nguyen et al., 2002; Martinez et al., 2008; Baranek et al., 2012; Fortin et al., 2013) . However, the experimental systems used in previous studies-direct infection of IFN receptor-deficient mice or WT mice with IFN neutralization-are complicated by potential differences in the degree of inflammation, effects on many cell types, and viral load. Thus, the direct influence of type I IFN on effector and long-lived antiviral NK cell responses, while eliminating pleotropic effects on other cells, has not been investigated previously.",

An indirect effect of type I IFN on NK cell development and maturation has been described recently (Mizutani et al., 2012; Guan et al., 2014) . Because the prolific expansion and generation of memory NK cells during mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection are dependent predominantly on the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-18 (Andoniou et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2012; Madera and Sun, 2015) , it was of interest to determine whether type I IFNs play a role in these processes. Here, we use NK cells deficient in the IFN AR1 chain (Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 ) in an adoptive cotransfer system and mixed bone marrow chimeric mice to investigate the direct influence of type I IFN signaling on NK cells responding against MCMV infection. cells were able to mature nearly as well as WT NK cells in response to MCMV infection, as indicated by the down-regulation of CD27 and up-regulation of CD11b and KLRG1 (Fig. 1 , B and C). We also investigated the contribution of type I IFN signaling in NK cells for protection against lethal MCMV challenge. Equal numbers of naive WT or Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells were transferred into separate neonatal mice and then challenged with MCMV. In contrast to mice receiving WT NK cells, which protected \u223c50% of recipients, all mice receiving Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells succumbed to infection by day 15 postinfection (PI; Fig. 1 D) , highlighting the importance of type I IFN signaling, specifically in NK cells, for protective immunity against viral challenge.",

LCMV infection elicits a strong type I IFN response (Biron et al., 1999) but does not drive the antigen-specific proliferation of Ly49H + NK cells observed during MCMV infection, thus ruling out the influence of the m157-Ly49H interaction in determining relative NK cell numbers. After adoptive transfer and LCMV infection in WT hosts, WT NK cells persisted, whereas the percentage of Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells diminished at day 7 PI (Fig. 5 A) . The decrease in Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells was seen as early as day 3 PI (not depicted). However, Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells transferred into Prf1 \u2212/\u2212 hosts were able to persist, and larger percentages were observed compared with the cotransferred WT NK cell population (Fig. 5 A) , uncovering a novel role for type I IFNs in protecting NK cells against perforin-mediated elimination. Similar results were observed when we infected mice with an MCMV strain lacking m157 (not depicted). To confirm that the elimination of Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells in WT mice was caused by host NK cells and not CD8 + T cells or another cell source, we transferred equal numbers of WT and Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells into WT or NKp46 Cre \u00d7 R26 DTA hosts and infected them with LCMV. NKp46 Cre \u00d7 R26 DTA mice express the Cre recombinase under the control of the NKp46 promoter and possess a loxP-flanked stop cassette followed by a diphtheria toxin A, thus creating a host where all NK cells are ablated. LCMV infection revealed a predominance of transferred WT NK cells compared with Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells in WT hosts, which was not observed in NKp46 Cre \u00d7 R26 DTA hosts (Fig. 5 A) . Similar to the perforin-deficient hosts, NKp46 Cre \u00d7 R26 DTA hosts revealed a higher percentage of Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells compared with WT NK cells after infection.

Because NKp46 has been suggested to promote NK cell-mediated killing of CD8 + T cells unable to sense type I IFNs (Crouse et al., 2014) , we tested whether this receptor contributed to NK cell-mediated fratricide using Ncr1 gfp/gfp mice in which the Ncr1 gene, which encodes protein NKp46, is deleted. Equal numbers of WT and Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells were cotransferred into WT and Ncr1 gfp/gfp hosts that were then infected with LCMV.

As expected, WT NK cells preferentially survived compared with Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells in the PBS-treated control mice (Fig. 5 C) . However, in mice receiving anti-NKG2D, a similar persistence between WT and Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells was observed (Fig. 5 C) , suggesting that the NKG2D pathway may represent at least one mechanism that activates fratricide. Similar results were observed in mice infected with MCMV lacking m157 (not depicted). Furthermore, we confirmed the expression of NKG2D ligands on the NK cells soon after infection. After LCMV infection of WT :Ifnar \u2212 /\u2212 bone marrow chimeras, Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells expressed significantly higher amounts of NKG2D ligand (Fig. 5 D) .

Equal numbers of Ly49H + WT (CD45.1) and Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 (CD45.2) NK cells from mixed chimeric mice were transferred into Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 \u00d7 Il2rg \u2212/\u2212 hosts (which lack T, B, and NK cells), and the recipient mice were then infected with MCMV. After MCMV infection, Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells expanded robustly and even exhibited an increase in percentage compared with WT NK cells (Fig. 6 A) . Activation and maturation of virus-specific Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells were nearly identical to WT NK cells, as indicated by CD27, CD11b, and KLRG1 expression at day 7 PI (Fig. 6, B-D) . Furthermore, Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells of a comparable phenotype to WT NK cells could be recovered at >4 wk PI (Fig. 6, E-G) , revealing the ability of Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells to generate a long-lived memory pool during infection in hosts lacking WT NK cells.

            "text": "Traditionally classified as a member of the innate immune system, NK cells are known to provide a crucial line of early defense against viral infections in both humans and mice (Bukowski et al., 1985; Rager-Zisman et al., 1987; Biron et al., 1989) . In more recent years, NK cells have been described to possess many features of adaptive immunity (Sun and Lanier, 2011; Vivier et al., 2011) . However, the molecular mechanisms behind these adaptive responses are not well understood. Our current findings demonstrate that direct type I IFN signaling in NK cells promotes their optimal activation and function during MCMV infection. In certain viral systems, such as during vaccinia virus infection, NK cell-dependent and -independent effects of type I IFN have been reported where NK cells were directly harvested from WT and Ifnar1 \u2212/\u2212 or Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Martinez et al., 2008; Fortin et al., 2013) . Other viral models, using mouse hepatitis virus or dengue virus infection, underscore the importance of type I IFN signaling in innate cells for viral control, with the primary focus being macrophages and dendritic cells (Cervantes-Barrag\u00e1n et al., 2009; Z\u00fcst et al., 2014) . In the context of MCMV infection, type I IFN has long been known to mediate antiviral effects, partly through its activity on NK cells (Nguyen et al., 2002) . However, the overwhelming majority of previous studies have failed to distinguish between the direct and indirect effects of type I IFNs on NK cells during the course of MCMV infection. Extending a recent study reporting both direct and indirect effects of type I IFN on the early NK cell and dendritic cell response after MCMV infection (Baranek et al., 2012) , our current study demonstrates that type I IFN acts directly on NK cells to promote their longterm survival by protecting them from elimination via NK cell-mediated fratricide.",

These studies relied on the direct infection of IFN-deficient mice (Geurs et al., 2009) , which fails to consider the effects of higher viral loads or administration of IFN-neutralizing antibodies during viral infection (Orange and Biron, 1996) , which could directly affect production of IL-15, a cytokine known to influence NK cell survival and proliferation. We demonstrate that NK cells unable to sense type I IFNs retain a functional proliferative program and even exhibit a modest increase in proliferation after infection when compared with WT NK cells (Figs. 4 A and 6 A) ; however, Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells were found to undergo more apoptosis than WT NK cells (Fig. 4 B) . Although our findings suggest that a perforin-and NK-G2D-dependent fratricide mechanism plays a major role in the increased cell death observed in Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells during viral infection, additional survival mechanisms may be lacking in these cells. Type I IFN previously has been described to promote the survival of activated CD8 + T cells in a manner that is independent of Bcl-2 (Marrack et al., 1999) , perhaps by enhancing the responsiveness of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells to IL-2 and IL-15 (Le Bon et al., 2006) and by regulating the expression of IL-7 and IL-15 cytokine receptors (Schluns and Lefran\u00e7ois, 2003) . Consistent with this hypothesis, we found no difference in the expression of Bcl-2 between WT and Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells after MCMV infection (unpublished data). Thus, a Bcl-2-independent mechanism is promoting survival of antigen-specific NK cells that can sense type I IFNs, shielding these cells from apoptosis. Future studies investigating gene targets of STAT1 may reveal additional prosurvival mechanisms in NK cells exposed to type I IFNs during viral infection.",

This preferential elimination of Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 CD8 + T cells was a consequence of the differential expression of inhibitory (MHC class I; Xu et al., 2014) and activating (NKp46; Crouse et al., 2014) NK cell signals. We explored the contribution of these distinct pathways in NK-NK cell fratricide and found that Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells exhibited a modest reduction (15-30%) in MHC class I expression after MCMV infection when compared with WT NK cells (unpublished data). However, NK cells are known to tolerate target cells that express a wide range of MHC class I surface levels (Jonsson et al., 2010; unpublished data) , with rejection only occurring when target cell MHC class I expression falls below 20% of the host levels (i.e., an 80% reduction in MHC class I expression; Brodin et al., 2010) . Thus, a 30% decrease in MHC class I expression will unlikely result in missing self-recognition and killing. However, because the triggering of NK cell activation and cytotoxicity stems from the net balance of activating and inhibitory input signals (Joncker et al., 2009 ), a modest decrease in MHC class I expression compounded by a strong activating signal, like that provided by NKG2D ligands, could possibly contribute to the selective killing of Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells observed in our study. Expression of NKp46 ligands was another mechanism suggested to trigger NK cell-mediated killing of Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 CD8 + T cells (Crouse et al., 2014) ; however, we found no role for NKp46 in NK cell-mediated elimination of Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells. Thus, unlike with NK cellmediated killing of CD8 + T cells, our data do not support a role for MHC class I molecules or NKp46 ligands in NK-NK cell fratricide during viral infection.",

Interestingly, the expansion defect in Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 NK cells is nearly as pronounced as that of the Il12rb \u2212/\u2212 NK cells, demonstrating a nonredundant role for these cytokines in promoting NK cell expansion. Based on our current findings, we propose a complementary role for IL-12 and type I IFN in simultaneously driving cellular proliferation and protecting against cell death via fratricide, respectively, during virus-specific NK cell expansion. Given the use of type I IFN in the clinic and its potential impact in vaccination strategies, it is important to elucidate the direct and indirect roles IFN has on specific cellular compartments during the immune response. Our work brings us one step closer by uncovering a novel protective role of type I IFN signaling in NK cells during viral infection.",

Bone marrow chimeric mice were infected by i.p. injections of 7.5 \u00d7 10 3 PFU of salivary gland-derived Smith strain MCMV. Mice used in adoptive transfer studies were infected with 7.5 \u00d7 10 2 PFU of MCMV. Newborn Ly49H-deficient mice were infected with 2 \u00d7 10 3 PFU of MCMV. LCMV infection was performed as described previously (Sun et al., 2004) . In vivo blockade of NKG2D signaling was accomplished by i.p. injection of anti-NKG2D (clone CX5; 200 \u00b5g/mouse) on day 0 of LCMV infection.",
