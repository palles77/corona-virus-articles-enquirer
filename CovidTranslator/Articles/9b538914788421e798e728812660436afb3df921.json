            "text": "As the primary method for protecting against these diseases up-to-date, vaccination via intramuscular or subcutaneous injection plays an outstanding role in evoking systemic immune responses, but it is not sufficient to induce mucosal antibodies, which are of great importance for the prevention of respiratory infectious diseases (1) . More suitable and effective vaccination strategies are in urgent need to overcome this problem. Nasal vaccination is a potential alternative to intramuscular vaccination because it may induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses. The nasal mucosa is the first defense against infection by respiratory pathogens, and the nasal cavity offers several clear advantages as a vaccination site, such as needle-free application, large mucosal surface and vasculature, relatively high permeability, abundant immunocompetent cells and relatively low enzymatic activity (2) . However, the major drawback of nasal vaccination is the relatively poor immunogenicity of free antigens when compared with that associated with intramuscular vaccination due to inefficient antigen delivery to the immune system via the nasal cavity (3) . Therefore, vaccine adjuvants or carriers for nasal immunization are necessary to improve the immunogenicity of antigens. Among the various carriers reported, quaternized chitosan nanoparticles are one of the most successful examples because bioadhesive quaternized chitosan can transitorily open tight junctions of the nasal epithelium and particles smaller than 5 \u03bcm can be easily recognized and processed as foreign bodies by antigen-presenting cells (APC) (4) . Moreover, the quaternization of chitosan can enrich its positive charge for interaction with cells and allow it to dissolve in water over a wide range of pH, especially under physiological conditions, resulting in good permeation enhancement and drug delivery properties (5) . Thus, in this study, we synthesized the quaternized derivative of chitosan, N-trimethylaminoethylmethacrylate chitosan (TMC) (6) , to prepare nanoparticles for the nasal vaccination of ovalbumin (OVA), a model antigen.",

            "text": "One crucial step for the vaccination of antigens is their contact with and recognization by APC. However, several factors such as low encapsulation efficiency of antigens and burst release before recognition by APC may weaken the role of antigen-loaded nanoparticles in nasal vaccination. An alternative approach to using this kind of nanoparticle is to covalently conjugate antigens on the surface of nanoparticles. Sloat et al. reported that the subcutaneous immunization of mice with antigen-conjugated lecithin-based nanoparticles induced a quick, strong, durable and functional immune response, possibly due to the ability of the nanoparticles to facilitate the uptake of the antigens by APC, thereby improving the trafficking of the antigens into local draining lymph nodes and activating APC (7) . It has also been demonstrated that antigens linked to inert solid nano-beads with a size range of 40-50 nm can induce high levels of antibody titres and cell-mediated immune response and protect animals from tumor cell growth or pathogens (8) (9) (10) (11) . These results prove the conjugation of antigens on nanoparticles to be a feasible method for immunization. However, to the best of our knowledge, this strategy has not been used in nasal immunization. Considering the relatively low enzymatic activity in the nasal cavity, which may result in the slight damage of antigens exposed to the outside, we designed novel antigenconjugated quaternized chitosan nanoparticles as a nasal vaccine. Compared with antigen-encapsulating nanoparticles, this nanoparticle carrier possesses the following advantages: 1) high use ratio of antigens; 2) antigens are conjugated on the surface of nanoparticles and are easily recognized and uptaken by APC; 3) antigens are covalently conjugated with nanoparticles and do not easily detach, which may be beneficial for the transport of antigens to the immune system, such as via cervical lymph nodes, resulting in enhanced mucosal and systemic immune responses.",

The amount of antigen delivered to the cervical lymph nodes after nasal administration determines, at least to some extent, the mucosal and systemic immune responses.

However, alum could not induce mucosal immune responses, which was consistent with the low OVA level of I.M. injection in cervical lymph nodes. Similar to other reports (26, 27) , the primary dose of the nasal immunization groups did not increase the IgG levels; thus, two or more doses were needed for nasal immunization to further activate the immune system. Interestingly, following three nasal immunizations, the IgG levels in the OVA-NP groups significantly increased and were even higher than those of the I.M. group (2.8 times), demonstrating high levels of systemic immune responses following the nasal immunization of OVA-NP.

In addition to penetrating across the nasal epithelia, nanoparticles may also be transported to the nasopharynx by nasal cilia movement and contact with NALT.

In our study, higher and more durable absorption of OVA in NALT through the OVA-NP than through the OVA solution was observed, suggesting that OVA-NP may be uptaken by M cells in NALT. The antigens in the lamina propria or NALT were then drained to superficial and deep cervical lymph nodes, which receive afferent lymphatic drainage from the nasal cavity and nasolabial region (33) and activate immune responses; thus, the larger amount of OVA derived from the OVA-NP than from the OVA solution or NPe in cervical lymph nodes led to higher levels of immune response.",
