Lithium chloride is a potential antiviral drug for viruses. We determined the antiviral effect of Lithium Chloride on canine parvovirus type 2 in feline kidney cells. The viral DNA and proteins of canine parvovirus were suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by lithium chloride. Further investigation verified that viral entry into cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by lithium chloride. These results indicated that lithium chloride could be a potential antiviral drug for curing dogs with canine parvovirus infection. The specific steps of canine parvovirus entry into cells that are affected by lithium chloride and its antiviral effect in vivo should be explored in future studies.",

This virus was named CPV-2 after an unrelated virus, canine parvovirus type 1 (CPV-1), which causes neonatal death in puppies [4, 5] . CPV-2 causes severe diarrhea and vomiting, and it has a predilection for young puppies, resulting in high mortality due to myocarditis and enteritis [31] . CPV-2 has spread rapidly, becoming globally distributed only two years after it was first identified, and it has been demonstrated to be a contagious pathogen to all populations of canids [12, 24] . Furthermore, CPV-2 has been evolving, and genetic variants continue to be identified. During 1979 and 1980, CPV-2 was completely replaced globally in canids by a new variant, CPV type 2a (CPV-2a) [22] [23] [24] . The virus underwent further antigenic drift, and a new variant, CPV type 2b (CPV-2b), was observed [25] . Subsequently, in 2000, another novel CPV variant (CPV-2c) was detected in several countries [10] . The mutations of variants have been mapped for VP2, which is the most abundant structural protein (CPV-2a: Val-555-Ile, Asp-305-Tyr, Ala-300-Gly, Ile-101-Thr and Met-87-Leu; CPV-2b: Ile-555-Val reversion and Asp-426-Asn; and CPV-2c: Asp-426-Glu).",

More recently, several reports have demonstrated the antiviral effect of LiCl on DNA viruses, such as herpes simplex virus [33] , pseudorabies herpesvirus [30] , and porcine parvovirus [7] . Lately, the antiviral effect of LiCl on RNA viruses, such as bronchitis coronavirus [13, 16] , transmissible gastroenteritis virus [27] , and type II porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [18] , has also been demonstrated.

The cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with 100 ll of LiCl at a series of concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, 100, 200 mM) in DMEM with 2 % FBS (five wells/dilution) for 48-72 h. As a control, five wells were mock treated. After washing with PBS, 80 ll of DMEM and 20 ll of CCK8 solution were added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1-4 h. The optical density (OD) value was measured using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA) at a wavelength of 450 nm. The relative cell viability was calculated as (mean OD 450 drug)/(mean OD 450 control) 9 100 %. The 50 % cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) was calculated using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA).",

First, LiCl concentrations of 0-60 mM were determined to have no significant toxicity in F81 cells and no significant effects on cell morphology. Second, after LiCl treatment, viral DNA and viral protein levels decreased and cell morphology improved. These results indicated that LiCl inhibits CPV infection of F81 cells. However, IFN expression was not affected by LiCl treatment, which indicates that the innate immune system is not impacted by LiCl. Thus, the potential antiviral effect of LiCl should be explored. The viral life cycle of CPV infection includes attachment to cells, entry into cells, and replication in the nucleus. These stages of the viral life cycle were evaluated after LiCl treatment in this study. CPV attaches to specific receptors on F81 cells in the initial step of the viral life cycle. The attachment step is significant for virus host tropism. We found that viral attachment was not affected by LiCl treatment. CPV replicates in the nucleus and requires that certain cellular factors are expressed during the S phase of the cell cycle. We also found that viral replication was not affected by LiCl treatment. CPV enters cells via an endocytic route that involves microtubule-dependent delivery of CPV to endosomes. This process is mediated by rapid removal of virus via clathrin-coated vesicles [21, 32] . Our results indicate that the CPV entry into F81 cells is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by LiCl, which indicates that clathrin-coated vesicles might be affected by LiCl treatment.",
