When large droplets of infected material reach the airways, they are removed by the mucociliary escalator, which sweeps entrapped contents up to the oropharynx, where they are swallowed or expectorated. Smaller particles, in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 \u00b5m, are deposited in the alveoli, where alveolar macrophages phagocytize and destroy most pathogens. These macrophages are further activated to release potent cytokines and chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-8, and leukotriene B 4 , which help recruit neutrophils from the blood stream into the alveolar spaces, where they participate in the uptake and degradation of microorganisms. For many microorganisms such as S. pneumoniae (Chapter 297), clearance of infection is greatly facilitated by the development of specific immunoglobulin G that binds the surface of the organisms or their polysaccharide capsule. These specific antibodies, which act as immune opsonins, greatly augment the ability of neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytize and destroy the bacteria. In addition, pattern recognition receptors and other nonimmune opsonins, including surfactant proteins A and D, fibronectin, and vitronectin, also bind to specific epitopes on the surface of organisms that reach the lower respiratory tract and assist in their recognition and elimination. Only when organisms overwhelm or evade these multiple host defense systems does inoculation of the lung result in clinically significant pneumonia.",

The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus (Chapter 374) with an incubation period of 2 to 10 days. The initial source of the infection remains uncertain, although palm civet cats and Chinese ferret badgers harbor a coronavirus with greater than 99% similarity to human SARS isolates. Worldwide, however, the illness is largely a nosocomial disease, with health care workers representing a significant fraction of the infected individuals. SARS is characterized by an insidious onset of fever, chills, headache, cough, malaise, and dyspnea, with radiologic evidence of pneumonia. Although upper respiratory symptoms are uncommon, voluminous watery diarrhea without mucus or blood develops in up to 70% of patients. SARS is believed to be principally transmitted by respiratory droplets. Current treatment is supportive, with no antiviral agent yet having been proved to be efficacious. SARS pneumonia tends to resolve slowly and spontaneously, usually by the third week of illness. However, the estimated casefatality rate remains approximately 10%. SARS is highly contagious, and lethal transmission to health care workers has been documented. Isolation procedures and equipment appropriate for SARS include standard, contact, and airborne isolation precautions such as scrupulous hand hygiene, gowning, disposable gloves, the use of N95 respirators, and eye protection.

These diffuse pulmonary infiltrations can be indistinguishable from other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Diffuse alveolar and interstitial infiltration can also be observed in patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (Chapter 349) related to immune suppression, such as in those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

However, current data have not clearly correlated Gram stain findings with the results of culture of alveolar materials in large numbers of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Nevertheless, sputum examination can strongly support the diagnosis of certain specific infections, including M. tuberculosis (acid-fast stain), endemic fungi (KOH preparations), P. jirovecii (methenamine silver or fluorescent antibody stain), or Legionella species (direct fluorescent antibody staining). In most cases of community-acquired pneumonia, the general intent of sputum Gram stain examination, if it is performed, should be to detect additional or unusual pathogens and hence to expand rather than narrow the initial antibiotic therapy.

The measurement of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen in serum can be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of invasive Aspergillus pneumonia in various immunocompromised patients. Bronchoscopy with lavage for immunostaining may, in selected circumstances, provide enhanced sensitivity, such as in the diagnosis of P. jirovecii pneumonia (Chapter 349).",

Important but often neglected interventions include smoking cessation (Chapter 31) and avoidance of illicit drugs (Chapter 33) or excess alcohol (Chapter 32), which may impair consciousness. Optimizing the patient's nutritional status is also important in that markedly underweight or obese patients are at increased risk. Finally, the appropriate and consistent use of vaccines can strongly reduce the risk for pneumonia in appropriate patient populations (Chapter 17). The current pneumococcal vaccine contains 23 purified capsular polysaccharides from the serotypes of S. pneumoniae that are responsible for more than 85% of invasive pneumococcal infections. Overall, this vaccine is approximately 50 to 80% effective in preventing death from invasive infection. Accordingly, current recommendations are that it should be administered to all patients older than 65 years and to patients younger than 65 years who have chronic pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, chronic liver disease, CSF leaks, or asplenia and to patients who live in certain settings, including Alaskan natives, high-risk Native American populations, and patients in long-term care facilities. Current pneumococcal vaccines have little toxicity, limited mainly to local site irritation. Individuals generally receive one dose of vaccine, but a single revaccination 5 years later should be considered in those who received their vaccination before 65 years of age or who are at increased risk for severe pneumonia. Pneumococcal vaccine can safely be administered at the time of hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia.",

Influenza vaccines are developed annually against the current influenza strains, so annual revaccination is necessary (Chapter 17). Influenza vaccines are estimated to be roughly 80% effective in preventing mortality related to influenza. The vaccine should be considered in all patients older than 50 years; residents of nursing homes and chronic care facilities; persons with chronic pulmonary, cardiac, or other diseases requiring ongoing medical care; pregnant women in the second or third trimester during influenza season; and all health care workers with direct patient contact.

Usual practice includes performing repeat radiography 6 to 8 weeks after completion of the antibiotic regimen. Persistence of abnormalities on the chest radiograph or the development of recurrent pneumonia in a similar distribution should prompt a careful search for an underlying endobronchial obstruction such as an occult neoplasm (Chapter 197), foreign body, bronchostenosis, or broncholithiasis. Follow-up CT scanning is usually the prelude to formal pulmonary consultation for consideration of bronchoscopy and other further diagnostic tests.",

In addition, patients with documented MDR organisms should be isolated to reduce the risk for patient cross-contamination. Microbiologic surveillance within the hospital environment is also necessary to identify MDR organisms and determine antibiotic use and susceptibility patterns. Within the ICU, intubation and reintubation rates should be monitored and reduced as feasible, the duration of mechanical ventilation should be minimized to reduce the risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia, and methods known to reduce infection rates should be followed (Chapter 105).

In combination, these agents should empirically address most MDR pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and K. pneumoniae strains with extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase production. Most L. pneumophila isolates will also be covered, but if Legionella is strongly suspected, a macrolide such as azithromycin should be included.

Adapted from American Thoracic Society. Guidelines for management of adults with hospital-acquired ventilator associated, and healthcare-associated pneumonia. tract secretions in the absence of a new antibiotic in the past 72 hours essentially excludes most bacterial pneumonias with a 94% negative predictive value, although Legionella and viral infection are still possible in this situation. The quantitative diagnostic threshold for significant bacterial infection, in the absence of recent (<72 hours) changes in antibiotic regimens, is as follows: greater than 10 6 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL for tracheal aspirates, greater than 10 4 or 10 5 cfu/mL for quantitative BAL fluid, and greater than 10 3 cfu/ mL for protected specimen brushings. The use of bronchoscopically obtained specimens and quantitative bacterial culture in directing therapy reduces the 14-day mortality in suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia.",
