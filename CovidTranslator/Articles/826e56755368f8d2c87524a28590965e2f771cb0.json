Although signaling pathways and transcription factors have a central role, it is becoming increasingly clear that epigenetic factors, in the form of DNA or histone modifications, as well as noncoding RNAs, are critical for generating the necessary cell lineage as well as context-specific gene expression in diverse innate immune cell types. Much of the epigenetic landscape is set during cellular differentiation; however, pathogens and other environmental triggers also induce changes in histone modifications that can either promote tolerance or 'train' innate immune cells for a more robust antigen-independent secondary response. Here we review the important contribution of epigenetic factors to the initiation, maintenance and training of innate immune responses. In addition, we explore how pathogens have hijacked these mechanisms for their benefit and the potential of small molecules targeting chromatin machinery as a way to boost or subdue the innate immune response in disease.",

Further, these epigenetic factors are essential for the recruitment of transcription machinery-either rapidly after pathogen sensing or in a delayed manner. 1 Importantly, histone modifications also prevent unwanted expression of potent mediators 2 and are implicated in the repression or enhancement of secondary gene programs triggered by re-stimulation of innate immune cells. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Recent work has also demonstrated the essential role of noncoding RNAs in innate immune gene expression. 8 Collectively, the combination of DNA or histone modifications, controlled recruitment of transcription factors following signal transduction and noncoding RNAs all lead to gene expression that is kinetically defined and cell-type specific.

Thirteen years ago, Allis and colleagues 9 put forward the 'histone code' hypothesis, which provided a model to explain how single and/or combinatorial posttranslational modifications on histones regulate gene transcription. They hypothesized that this code is as important as the DNA sequence itself. Since the conception of this hypothesis, largely due to the development of techniques such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing, the field has witnessed unprecedented advance in our understanding of the numerous enzymes that contribute to the establishment of histone modifications, as well as the assorted effector proteins that bind them. Whether or not histone modifications constitute a strict 'code', it is clear that the elaborate combinations of posttranslational modifications on histone function tightly regulate cell-specific gene transcription. Also, it has been argued that histone modifications are not truly 'epigenetic', as the nature of their heritability (a requirement in the classical definition of epigenetic) remains questionable. This is particularly relevant in cells of the immune system where direct heritability of induced epigenetic modifications has yet to be formally demonstrated. However, as we will discuss, pathogen-induced epigenetic modifications, particularly in cells of the innate immune system, can influence secondary responses to the same or different pathogens at least in the short term (1 week to 3 months).",

            "text": "Epigenetic ('Epi' =outside of or above) regulation of gene expression is a dynamic process that establishes precise cellular development and function in genetically identical cells. Such regulation is brought about by embellishments on the DNA itself and on DNA-associated histone proteins. DNA modifications primarily are CpG cytosine-5 methylation 10 and 5hydroxymethylcytosine, 11 but hydroxylation, formylation and carboxylation have also been observed. 12 In eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged into chromatin, the basic repeating unit of which is a nucleosome. A nucleosome consists of 147 bp nucleotides wrapped around a histone octamer, which is composed of two copies each of histone H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 ( Figure 1 ). With the addition of another histone protein called the 'linker' H1, nucleosomes are packaged into progressively higher-order structures to ultimately form chromosomes. Unstructured NH2-terminal histone tails that protrude from the nucleosome are subject to covalent chemical modifications, which impact chromatin organization and function. Recent mass spectrometry analysis identified more than a dozen different types of posttranslational modifications on histone tails, 13 including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, citrullination and ubiquitination. 14 Histone modifications with the exception of methylation result in a change in the net charge of nucleosomes, loosening interactions between histones and DNA. This directly affects the levels of chromatin compaction, creating condensed 'heterochromatic' or more open 'euchromatic' regions and thus restricting or allowing access of transcription factors to promoters or enhancers on DNA. The effects of histone methylation on gene expression are dependent on the position of the amino acid residues that are methylated and whether the residues are mono-, di-or trimethylated. Methylation of Histone 3, Lysine 4 (H3K4), H3K36 and H3K79 is often associated with active transcription, whereas methylation of H3K9, H3K27 or H4K20 is associated with transcriptional repression. 10, 15 A key facet of epigenetics is that these modifications can be stably maintained, yet adapt to changing developmental or environmental needs. This delicate task is accomplished by three main classes of enzymes: 'writers', which establish the epigenetic modifications (DNA and histone methyltransferases, histone acetyltransferases, kinases, and so on), 'erasers', which remove them (demethylases, histone deacetylases (HDACs), phosphatases) and 'readers', which interpret them by docking to modified histones through defined protein domains ( Figure 1 , see Table 1 for examples of epigenetic enzymes). The reader enzymes aid assembly of the appropriate transcriptional machinery at sites of recognition. Thus, not only do histone modifications determine the accessibility of DNA but are also directly responsible for recruiting transcriptional machinery to specific loci. Other contributors to epigenetic regulation of genes expression include nucleosome occupancy and positioning, 16 histone variants 17 and noncoding RNAs such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). 8",

A prominent role for H3K27 methylation has been described in transcriptional responses from innate immune cells. One of the first reports identifying the Jumonji (JMJ) catalytic domain containing JMJD3 as a histone H3K27me3 demethylase demonstrated a rapid induction of JMJD3 by proinflammatory stimuli. 19 It was subsequently shown that JMJD3 is recruited to the transcription start sites of >70% of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced genes. 20 Further, JMJD3 is essential for M2 macrophage polarization in response to helminth infection and chitin, although it is dispensable for M1 responses. 21 The histone methyltransferase G9a directs methylation of histone H3 on Lysine 9 (H3K9me). Di-or tri-methylation of H3K9 is repressive not only by influencing DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation but also by prohibiting the 'activating' modification acetylation and actively recruiting transcriptional repressors of the Heterochromatin protein 1 family. 22 H3K9 methylation is found at a subset of promoters of inducible genes such as IL12b and CCL22 but this repressive mark is removed rapidly following LPS stimulation. 23 Similarly, H3K9 di-methylation levels at type I interferon (IFN) and IFN responsive genes inversely correlate with the scope and amplitude of IFN and ISG expression. Professional IFN-producing cells such as dendritic cells have significantly lower levels of H3K9 di-methylation at these gene promoters compared with weak producers of IFN, such as fibroblasts, cardiac myocytes, or neuroblastoma cells. Further, genetic ablation of the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a enhanced IFN production by fibroblasts and their ability to suppress virus. 2 Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other sensors modify histones in a manner associated with the activation of transcription. Two of the main permissive modifications are H3 Lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) denoting an active promoter and H3 Lysine 36 tri-methylation (H3K36me3) associated with active transcription. Dendritic cells stimulated with LPS upregulate H3K4me3, which is very stable for 2 h following stimulation, with the exception of about 30 loci that are lowly expressed before stimulation and become strongly induced after stimulation. 24 Similarly, macrophages upregulate H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 at the promoters and enhancers, respectively, of multiple genes following exposure to a range of stimuli, with the majority of acquired H3K4me3 returning to basal levels within a few hours. 4, 25 ",

            "text": "Histone acetylation is a reversible posttranslational modification catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that transfer the acetyl moiety of acetyl-CoA to lysine (K) residues. HDACs reverse this process. LPS-stimulated macrophages show increased histone H4 acetylation (H4Ac), an indicator of open chromatin at numerous sites across the genome. The induced histone acetylation at lysines 5, 8 and 12 (H4K5/8/12Ac) usually occurs at promoters, within 1 h of stimulation, decreasing after 2 h. 25 In dendritic cells H4K27 acetylation was very dynamic over an LPS time course correlating with RNA polymerase II Mehta (Pol II) binding. 24 Histone acetylation is exclusively 'read' by bromodomains of which there are 46 bromodomain-containing proteins in the human genome. Bromodomains of individual proteins have defined affinities to specific locations of lysine acetylation and recruit distinct proteins to the chromatin. 26 Hence, each subclass of bromodomain proteins likely has unique functions in regulating gene expression. Most work has focused on the role of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) subfamily of bromodomain-containing proteins that consists of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and a testis-specific BRDT. BET proteins connect histone acetylation state to transcriptional elongation machinery. 1, 27 Only BRD4 can recruit positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) through its C terminal domain and removes the pausing complex negative elongation factor (NELF) and 5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) allowing transcriptional elongation. 27, 28 BRD4 can also co-activate transcriptional activation of NF-\u03baB via specific binding to acetylated RelA. 29 Knockdown of BRD2, 3 or 4 proteins, however, results in reduced expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, suggesting that all three BET proteins control the transcription of inflammatory genes in LPS-stimulated macrophages. 25 This is likely through the ability of BRD2, 3 and 4 to interact with the polymerase-associated factor 1 complex, or other chromatin-modifying proteins such as NSD3 or JMJD6. 30",

LncRNA-Cox2 is essential for controlling basal levels of IFN stimulatory genes (ISGs) and is also required for proinflammatory cytokine production following microbial challenge. LncRNA-Cox2 mediates its repressive functions on ISGs through interactions with hnRNP-A/B and A2/B1. Knockdown of lncRNA-Cox2 or hnRNP-A/B or A2/B1 resulted in decreased levels of RNA Pol II recruitment to the promoter of Ccl5 in macrophages. 8 LncRNAs have also been shown to be upregulated in the context of viral infection and downstream IFN production. Approximately 500 lncRNAs were differentially expressed following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus or influenza 32 and more than 200 lncRNAs were upregulated following treatment of human hepatocytes with type I IFN. 33 One lncRNA, lnRNA-CMPK2, was a potent negative regulator of ISGs and its knockdown resulted in reduction of Hepatitis C virus replication. 33",

ATPdependent chromatin-remodeling complexes are responsible for sliding of the nucleosomes, as well as for insertion and ejection of histone octamers, processes that are, like histone modification, important for transcriptional repression and activation. The remodeling complexes can be divided into four families: SWI/SNF, CHD (chromodomain and helicaselike domain), ISWI and INO80 (including SWR1, or SRCAP in mammals). Promoters of primary response genes (PRGs) such as Tnf, Fos and Nfkbia contain CpG islands which are refractory to DNA methylation, and histone tail modifications, both of which are commonly found at the promoters of actively transcribed genes (for example, H3K4me3 and H4Ac) as well as high levels of RNA Pol II association in naive macrophages, indicating that these chromatin specifications likely occur during lineage commitment. 1, 25 Thus, macrophages are preprogramed to enable expression of a defined set of PRGs within minutes of cell activation. 34, 35 These genes do not require SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling or de novo protein synthesis for their activation, as they are transcriptionally primed and their chromatin state is permissive of rapid access by transcription factors. PRGs produce low levels of unspliced and unstable transcripts, and upon stimulation recruit the elongation factor P-TEFb and switch to production of mature, processed mRNAs. 1 In contrast, late PRGS such as Ifnb1 and secondary response genes such as Il12b and Il6, which are transcribed hours after cell stimulation, possess low-density CpG promoters, display low H3K4me3, H4Ac and RNA Pol II occupancy in naive macrophages and require the SWI/SNF complex for chromatin remodeling for transcription to take place. 34, 35 ",

However, the ability to remember and respond more vigorously to a second pathogen encounter has been described in organisms lacking T and B cells. Plants and invertebrates do not possess an adaptive immune system, which first appeared during evolution in jawless or early-jawed vertebrates. 36 However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the immune system of plants and invertebrates can be primed by previous infections and mount stronger recall responses upon pathogen re-challenge. 37, 38 Now, examples of innate immune antigen-and non-antigen-specific 'memory' are rapidly emerging in mammals. [4] [5] [6] [7] 39 Innate monocytes and neutrophils from mice infected with attenuated Listeria monocytogenes were capable of 'bystander' killing of an unrelated pathogen (Leishmania major) upon secondary infection. 40,41 However, such priming was orchestrated primarily by IFN\u03b3 and other inflammatory mediators produced by memory T cells. 40, 42 Certainly, other studies have now shown that memory T cells can trigger activation of innate immune cells following reinfection. 43,44 Examples of innate immune boosting by means that are independent of adaptive immunity have also emerged. A combination of aerosolized TLR agonists could protect mice against bacterial pneumonia and influenza infection 45,46 and infection with H. polygyrus significantly inhibited type 1 diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice through CD25and interleukin (IL)-10-independent mechanisms. 47 The Netea laboratory demonstrated that monocytes recovered from healthy volunteers who were vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, a widely used live attenuated vaccine against tuberculosis, produced significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines following exposure to non-mycobacterial bacteria and fungi. 7 Importantly, this non-antigen-specific innate immune 'training' was maintained up to 3 months post the initial vaccination. Further, they showed that monocyte immune 'training' was completely independent of T and B cells, as severe combined immunodeficiency mice vaccinated 2 weeks prior with Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin survived significantly longer after a lethal inoculum of Candida albicans. 7 Moreover, Rag1-deficient mice were protected from a secondary challenge of C. albicans or LPS following priming with C. albicans. These findings suggest that 'training' of innate immune cells in mammals could be cell intrinsic, or at the very least independent of the adaptive immune system.",

Until recently, it was thought that cell lineage-and signal-specific gene expression programs are fundamentally predetermined during cellular differentiation. However, recent evidence demonstrated that terminally differentiated cells such as monocytes and macrophages can acquire additional histone modifications upon pathogen exposure that affect gene expression upon subsequent stimulation. TLR4 activation by LPS induces histone modifications that lead to altered and repressed gene expression upon secondary LPS stimulation. 3, 48 Many of these pathogen-induced epigenetic changes in macrophages, particularly mono-methylation of lysine(K)-4 on Histone 3 (H3K4me1) at enhancers, persist despite washout of the stimulus and removal of the transcription factors responsible for the initial deposition. Moreover, H3K4me1 was associated with a faster and stronger induction of multiple genes upon nonspecific restimulation. 4 C. abicans-induced innate immune training was associated with changes in the activating H3K4me3 at certain gene promoters in peritoneal macrophages 7 days post initial infection. In addition, a methyltransferase inhibitor prevented this induced training. 6 A follow-up study by the same group showed that \u03b2-glucan, the cell wall component of C. albicans, could induce changes in H3K4me3 as well as H3K27ac in human monocytes 7 days after washout. Without a direct comparison to induced H3K4me3 or H3K27Ac after acute stimulation it remains difficult to interpret whether these are maintained epigenetic modifications or are just demonstrative of active transcription in these cells triggered by other mechanisms. Nonetheless, many genes with altered H3K4me3 or H3K27ac profiles 1 week after C. albicans exposure were involved in innate immune signaling, and a large proportion with enhanced H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac were associated with glycolysis, 5 raising an interesting potential of a metabolic switch in innate immune training. Multiple epigenetic modifications have a well-established link to central metabolism, as histone-modifying enzymes require metabolites as substrates or cofactors: demethylases and TET proteins are Fe(II) and \u03b1ketoglutarate dioxygenases; HDACs are (NAD)-dependent enzymes; and S-adenosyl methionine is required for function of DNA/histone methyltransferases. Therefore, these enzymes are likely sensitive to fluctuations in these metabolites. 49 Interplay between metabolism and epigenetics would allow the relative metabolic activity of the cell to feed back into transcriptional regulation in an effort to maintain homeostasis. In fact, it has been proposed that epigenetic processes may initially have been a means to transduce metabolic events into phenotypic results. 50 This is well documented in cancer cells that switch to anaerobic metabolism (the 'Warburg effect') and exhibit multiple epigenetic imbalances. 49 Interestingly, macrophages and other innate immune cells are frequently found in inflamed sites, which are characterized by low oxygen levels and therefore may also rely heavily on the relationship between metabolism and epigenetics for gene expression. Certainly, activation of TLRs, notably TLR4, leads to a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis in immune cells. 51 Succinate, which is known to inhibit \u03b1-ketoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases such as histone and DNA demethylases, as well as prolyl hydroxylases, 50 is elevated in inflammation and sustains IL-1\u03b2 production through hypoxiainducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 stabilization. 52 Also, differentiation of monocytes to macrophages results in a change in abundance of enzymes responsible for peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation pathway, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. 48 \u03b2-Glucan-trained monocytes exhibited reduced oxygen consumption, enhanced glucose consumption, increased production of lactate and an increased NAD + /NADH ratio, 5 which may be responsible for the observed alterations in H3K4me3, H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 in these cells. 5,48, It is unknown whether these pathogen-induced 'epigenetic' changes are maintained for the life of the infected cell (or in daughter cells or hematopoietic stem cells, to be truly 'epigenetic') for an innate immune memory of pathogen infection in vivo. Cells of the innate immune system have been generally thought to be short lived. However, tissue macrophages have been shown to live for months if not years, particularly at sites of inflammation or tumors, 53 but whether they proliferate remains unclear. If demonstrated to be long lived, it is to be expected that trained immunity through epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms will have important consequences for the design of vaccination strategies. Moreover, an individual's history of infection may influence the function of their innate immune system, at least in the short term, through altered epigenetics.",

The pathogen must also prevent an excessive inflammatory reaction not only to avoid elimination but also to ensure its own survival by keeping the host alive. To this end, pathogens have evolved strategies to disrupt host immune signaling cascades that culminate in drastic transcriptional upregulation of several proinflammatory and other immune response genes.

Commensal bacteria are essential for the induction/maintenance of DNA methylation at the TLR4 gene in large intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in reduced TLR4 expression and thus avoiding an excessive inflammatory reaction. 54,55 Pathogens, which face a different selection pressure to commensals, have evolved proteins that interfere, interact with or mimic components of the host's epigenetic machinery, often resulting in subversion of the host innate immune response. Broadly, this is achieved by changing the chromatin architecture in three ways: host histone modification using the host's own epigenetic writer enzymes, interfering directly with enzymes of the host's chromatin-remodeling machinery, or by manufacturing proteins that specifically recognize host histone targets. We will review these strategies with the help of relevant examples below ( Figure 3 , Table 2 ).",

[60] [61] [62] Pathogens that interfere with the host's chromatin-remodeling machinery M. tuberculosis counters the host IFN-\u03b3-induced inflammatory response by repressing IFN stimulatory MHC class II (HLA-DR) and its transactivator protein CIITA. TLR2-mediated downstream MAPK signaling leads to binding of a transcriptional repressor C/EBP to the CIITA promoter region, keeping out the chromatin remodeler complex SWI/SNF. The CIITA-regulated HLA-DR is also repressed, with promoter enrichment of HDAC containing chromatin complexes. 62, 63 Interestingly, L. Monocytogenes secretory protein LntA directly interacts with the chromatin repressor BAHD1, probably dislodging BAHD1 from ISG promoters and subsequently upregulating some ISG. 64, 65 This seemingly counterintuitive strategy is proposed to be a mechanism used by the pathogen to fine-tune host IFN I and II response to infection, given that, although required for bacterial virulence, constitutive LntA expression leads to faster bacterial clearance, and BAHD1 deletion heterozygous mice are more resistant to infection compared with wild-type siblings. 65",

Consistent with this, treatment with HDAC1 inhibitors severely restricts the bacterium's ability to survive in the host, suggesting that the pathogen may survive the harsh environment of the neutrophil by HDAC1-mediated deacetylation and suppression of host defense genes. 68 It has been suggested that an ankyrin-repeat-containing bacterial secretory protein that binds AT-rich chromatin regions is responsible for HDAC recruitment to relevant gene promoters in the host 68,69",

These studies suggest that modulating the 'eraser' of these suppressive modifications, JMJD3 demethylase, by small molecules may be one way to curtail inflammation. However, this possibility is complicated by the fact that regulation of proinflammatory genes by JMJD3 may be independent of its demethylase activity. 20 Also, the degree of sequence similarity among the JMJC domains of histone demethylases made it unclear whether small molecule inhibitors could exhibit adequate substrate specificity. GlaxoSmithKline answered this challenge by identifying a highly selective inhibitor (GSK-J1 and a cell-permeable GSK-J4) of a lysine-specific demethylase UTX and JMJD3 that acted as an \u03b1-ketoglutarate mimic. 79 GSK-J4 prevented demethylation of the repressive H3K27me3, and reduced RNA Pol II recruitment, which prevented transcription of TNF and other inflammatory cytokines in LPS-treated human monocytes. 79 Interestingly, a single knockdown of either UTX or JMJD3 did not reduce TNF, suggesting that these demethylases act together in the control of cytokine transcription.",

Some recent and elegant single-cell analyses revealed that histone H3 lysine-27 acetylation at a gene locus alters downstream transcription kinetics by as much as 50%, affecting two temporally separate events. First, acetylation enhances the search kinetics of transcriptional activators, and later the acetylation accelerates the transition of Pol II from initiation to elongation. 80 In mammals, HDACs are divided into three classes on the basis of their cellular localization and tissue distribution. Class I HDACs are ubiquitously expressed and are predominately nuclear. Class II HDACs are both nuclear and cytoplasmic and only expressed in certain tissues. Class III HDACs, also called sirtuins (SIRT1-7), are NAD+-dependent enzymes.",

Indeed, various Class I as well as Class II HDAC targeting inhibitors like trichostatin A, Vorinostat (suberanilohydroxamic acid), phenylbutyrate and givinostat have shown anti-inflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in Table 3 ). [81] [82] [83] [84] Recently it was shown that butyrate exposure of mouse colonic lamina propria macrophages leads to an increase in expression of proinflammatory mediators NO, IL-6 and IL-12 but not of TNF, and to an increase in H3K9Ac levels at the promoter regions of these genes in mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages. 85 In contrast to the above-described pan-inhibitors of HDACs, specific class and isoform HDAC inhibitors have been identified for HDAC1 and HDAC3, and show anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of inflammatory diseases and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 81 from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, respectively (Table 3 ). Despite the reasonable success of HDACs as anti-inflammatory agents, their exact mode of epigenetic regulation as anti-inflammatory agents in vivo is unclear, the elucidation of which is further confounded by the fact that most HDACs act on both histone or nonhistone substrates and that HDAC inhibition leads to both gene expression and suppression in a cell-contextdependent manner (reviewed in Adcock 86 ).",

            "text": "Through their function as epigenetic 'readers' and their central role in the recruitment of transcriptional machinery, the BET family of bromodomain-containing proteins is critical for the expression of multiple genes, including those involved in tumor cell growth and inflammation, making them very attractive therapeutic targets. Moreover, targeting epigenetic 'readers' seemed an appealing way to specifically interrupt the interpretation of epigenetic modifications without altering the overall epigenetic landscape of the cell, which could conceivably occur by targeting 'writers' or 'erasers'. Bromodomain modules share a conserved fold that comprises a left-handed bundle of four \u03b1-helices that surround a central acetylated lysine-binding site. I-BET762 (also known as GSK525762A) and GSK525768A (which is the (R)-enantiomer of I-BET762) were identified initially through a screen for upregulation of APOA1. Upon subsequent chemoproteomics involving immobilization of the compounds on a matrix, followed by affinity purification of interacting proteins from cell extracts and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, the interacting proteins were identified as BRD2, 3 and 4. I-BET762 acts as a histone mimic and competitively inhibits the binding of BET proteins to acetylated histone peptides, and has a low affinity toward other bromodomain family members, making it a specific inhibitor of the BET subfamily. 25 Treatment of mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages with I-BET762 selectively inhibited activation of a subset of LPS-inducible cytokines, chemokines and several transcription factors required for an inflammatory response. 25 LPS-inducible and I-BET susceptible genes showed significantly reduced enrichment of the BET proteins BRD2, 3 and 4, as well as P-TEFb and Pol II, demonstrating that I-BET762 successfully prevented assembly of chromatin-activating and elongation-promoting complexes at these promoters. The vast majority of genes that were suppressed by I-BET were late PRGs and secondary response genes with low CpG, low H4Ac, low H3K4me3 and low Pol II at their promoters in naive macrophages. PRGs or housekeeping genes with high CpG, high H3K4me3 and high H4Ac could not be inhibited with I-BET treatment, possibly because of the inability of I-BET, acting as a histone mimic, to outcompete the preexisting levels of acetylation at those loci. Importantly, I-BET administration (30 mg kg \u22121 , intravenous) also prevented LPS-induced endotoxic shock and bacteria-induced sepsis in mice, 25 highlighting its potential as an antiinflammatory agent. A second class of BET family bromodomain inhibitor, I-BET151, with improved pharmacokinetics, 30 was also shown to reduce levels of circulating IL-6 and protected mice from LPS-induced death. 87 Independent studies using an alternative pan-BET inhibitor, JQ1, also observed suppression of proinflammatory cytokine induction and rescued mice from LPS-induced death. 88 Finally, in murine macrophages, MS436, a compound that preferentially targets the first bromodomain of BRD4, blocked the transcriptional activity of BRD4 in the NF-\u03baB-directed production of nitric oxide and IL-6. 89 BET family members have also been implicated in the replication of the viral genome and in the transcriptional regulation of multiple viral proteins. For example, BRD4 competes with the HIV transactivator protein Tat for P-TEFb binding, 90 which results in repression of Tatmediated transactivation of the HIV promoter. Further, BRD2 modulates HIV transcription by associating with the E2F1 transcription factor, which binds together with NF-\u03baB to the HIV enhancer to repress HIV transcription. 91 This suggested that BET inhibitors could reverse HIV latency. 92 Awakening of latent HIV means that the virus can be completely eradicated using antiviral agents, which suggests that BET bromodomains could be potential new targets for HIV induction strategies. 93 Although these pan-BET inhibitor studies show great preclinical promise and also aid in investigating the biology of bromodomain-containing proteins, specific BET isoform inhibitors that solely target BRD4, 3, 2 or BRDT may eventually be required for specific indications with limited side effects.",

This is illustrated by recent discoveries of new classes of chromatin-modifying enzymes, greater insight into the function of some of these chromatin-associated proteins in immune cells, findings of somatic mutations in genes coding for epigenetic machinery in immune-based disorders and the development of highly potent and specific small molecule inhibitors to epigenetic enzymes that demonstrate potency in immune cells. Along with this, our idea of innate immunity is swiftly changing with the developing concept that the innate immune system may bear some 'memory' of previous pathogen encounters. These new data, along with strong interest and hasty progress from drug companies and academic consortiums (http:// www.thesgc.org/epige-netics) to target epigenetic factors, could be effectively utilized for improved treatment of diseases associated with innate immunity. Pathogens that have been difficult to target through conventional vaccination strategies could benefit from 'training' of the innate immune system via epigenetic manipulation. Further, we believe that adjusting whole subsets of inflammatory genes rather than individual inflammatory mediators through druggable epigenetic enzymes would better serve the multitude of inflammatory disorders that currently lack effective therapies.

Each octamer is made up of two copies each of four histone proteins around which ~ 147 bp of DNA is wound. N-terminal 'tails' of the histone proteins protrude from the core of the octamer and are the sites of reversible covalent modifications such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination (all represented by a generic pink star). The gain of covalent modifications is catalyzed by histone-modifying enzymes-that is, 'writers'. 'Readers' recognize specific modifications and in doing so assist assembly of chromatin-remodeling complexes at the sites of recognition, and 'erasers' catalyze removal of covalent modifications.
