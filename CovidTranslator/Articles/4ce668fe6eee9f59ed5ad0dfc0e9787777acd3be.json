Acute exacerbations are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality [1] [2] [3] and preventing exacerbations remains a major unmet need. There has been increasing interest in a recently identified sub-group of patients with COPD who are at risk of exacerbations, defined as the 'frequent exacerbator phenotype'. 4 Patients with frequent exacerbations have worse clinical outcomes including increased morbidity 1 , accelerated lung function decline 2 and greater mortality 5 , suggesting that this group requires special consideration. To date, the underlying mechanisms that predispose such patients to more frequent exacerbations have not been elucidated. It is plausible that abnormalities in host immunity could underlie an increased propensity to exacerbations.",

However, not all studies have shown this abnormality 10, 11 , suggesting that it may vary according to disease phenotype. Frequent exacerbators could represent one sub-group in whom defective anti-viral immunity is more prominent. Both experimental and naturally-occurring exacerbation studies also confirm that an initial virus infection can precipitate secondary bacterial infection in COPD 12, 13 with neutrophil elastase-induced cleavage of anti-microbial peptides believed to be important mechanistically 12 . Although bacterial colonisation at stable state has been shown to be associated with increased exacerbation frequency 14 , antimicrobial peptide responses and propensity to develop secondary bacterial infection during virusinfections in frequent versus infrequent exacerbators has not previously been studied.",

We additionally confirm that COPD frequent exacerbators have reduced ex vivo immune responses to RV infection in primary airway epithelial cells, indicating an innate anti-viral deficiency. This is the first study to show that frequent exacerbators have impaired airway antimicrobial responses and provides an important mechanistic advance in our understanding of this clinically important COPD sub-group.

We have previously reported that protein production of IFN persists at least up to 96 hours in this cell type 21 and it is feasible that evaluation at later timepoints may be required to observe significant differences in translated IFN proteins. Despite a lack of difference in absolute levels of IFN protein, the reduced ISG expression observed in frequent exacerbators supports a less effective IFN-induced response in these subjects Bacterial infection is also associated with exacerbation in COPD with increased PCR-based bacterial detection at exacerbation versus stable state suggesting a causative role 28, 29 . Additionally, virusinduced secondary bacterial infection has been reported in both experimental and naturally occurring exacerbations 12, 13 . We have previously reported that experimental RV challenge in patients with COPD is associated with increased frequency of secondary bacterial infection compared to healthy subjects 12,30 via a mechanism of neutrophil elastase-mediated cleavage of anti-microbial peptides SLPI and elafin 12 . Here, we extend these findings to reveal that frequent exacerbators have higher bacterial loads at 2 weeks following onset of virus-associated exacerbation, suggesting that this subgroup of COPD patients might be at greatest risk of developing secondary bacterial infection following initial virus infection.

            "text": "Genetic MBL deficiency has been previously shown to be associated with both increased 25, 36 and reduced 37 exacerbation frequency in COPD. Although serum MBL concentrations have been shown to not differ between frequent and infrequent exacerbators 36 , a previous study reported reduced bronchoalveolar lavage MBL concentrations in COPD versus healthy subjects 38 . Our data extends these observations by demonstrating that deficient airway MBL-2 at baseline and during subsequent exacerbation might predispose frequent exacerbators to increased secondary bacterial infection. A previous study reported that the presence of rhinovirus is associated with increased S.pneumoniae colonization in children with MBL gene polymorphisms, further suggesting a role for MBL in virusinduced secondary bacterial infection 39 . Given that nebulised plasma-derived MBL has been shown to restore phagocytic function in smoke-exposed mice 40 , our data raise speculation that administration of MBL could additionally be considered as an effective preventative and/or therapeutic strategy for COPD exacerbations. Further studies are needed to evaluate this.",

            "text": "It is important to note that causation cannot be inferred from the results of our study. Although we found reduced anti-microbial responses in patients with a history of frequent exacerbations, we cannot reliable conclude that these abnormalities directly lead to inherent increased exacerbation risk per se. There are likely to be a number of additional factors that may be contributing to the observed differences and, notably, in stable state analyses, frequent exacerbators showed trends towards greater ICS use and less current smoking. These confounders could contribute directly or indirectly to the differences observed, as previously reported 21, 41, 42 . We therefore consider our study to be hypothesis generating and emphasise the importance of future larger in vivo studies to more carefully dissect the influence of various factors and definitely answer the question of whether deficient antimicrobial immunity underlies propensity to exacerbation frequency in COPD. Previous studies have also indicated that exacerbation risk in COPD is dynamic and may change from year to year 4, 43 . A longer-term study with repeated airway sampling would be need to determine whether baseline antimicrobial responses are similarly dynamic in nature. author/funder. All rights reserved.

We examined baseline sputum cell mRNA expression of type I and III IFNs and ISGs in 36 patients from the community-based COPD cohort and found that frequent exacerbators had significantly reduced sputum IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb2/3 mRNA expression with no difference in IFN\u03bb1 (Figure 1a). Baseline sputum concentrations of the interferon-inducible protein CXCL10/IP-10 (Figure 1b) were also reduced in frequent exacerbators but no difference in mRNA expression of other ISGs 2'-5' OAS, viperin or Mx1 was observed (Figure 1c). Sputum interferon and ISG expression during virus positive exacerbation In the community-based cohort, 18 episodes of acute exacerbation with positive virus detection were observed (rhinovirus n=11, coronavirus n=4, RSV n=2, influenza n=1). Of these, n=7 (38.9%) occurred in patients classified as frequent exacerbators. Clinical characteristics of the exacerbating patients are shown in table 2. One patient was hospitalised during exacerbation with all other episodes treated in the community. Having observed that frequent exacerbators have reduced capacity to mount an innate anti-viral response at stable state, we next examined sputum cell mRNA expression of IFNs and ISGs in the sub-group of patients who developed an exacerbation associated with positive virus detection. Frequent exacerbators had significantly reduced sputum cell expression of IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03bb2/3 and IFN\u03bb1 mRNAs at exacerbation presentation (Figure 2a). Sputum 2'-5'OAS mRNA expression was also significantly reduced at exacerbation presentation in frequent versus infrequent exacerbators differences observed for viperin or Mx1 expression (Figure 2b). Frequent exacerbators also had reduced sputum concentrations of the interferon-inducible cytokine CXCL10/IP-10 at exacerbation onset and 2 weeks post-onset with a similar non-significant trend (P=0.25) observed at exacerbation onset for CCL5/RANTES (Figure 2c). Ex vivo bronchial epithelial anti-viral responses to RV infection are attenuated in frequent exacerbators Having observed reduced IFN-and ISG-expression in frequent exacerbators from in vivo sputum samples taken during exacerbation, we next proceeded to determine whether epithelial cells from patients with COPD who are frequent exacerbators have deficient innate responses to RV infection. We utilised BECs collected bronchoscopically from sixteen patients with COPD (n=9 frequent exacerbators, n=7 infrequent exacerbators), differentiated at an air liquid interface and infected with RV-A1 at MOI = 0.1.
