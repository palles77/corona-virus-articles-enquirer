These concerns escalated following the September 2001 terrorist attack and the anthrax bioterrorism incident in the United States of America; the worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; and the reemergence of H5N1 avian influenza soon thereafter, which stoked fears about the possibility of a severe influenza pandemic. To better prepare and coordinate countries to respond to all-hazards health emergencies at their borders, in the past 10 years the global public health community has formed numerous domestic and international alliances.",

Prior to the 2005 revision, Member States were required to report cholera, plague and yellow fever. The revised regulations 2 are risk-based rather than prescriptive and mandate the recognition and notification of any unusual public health event or emergency of international concern that meets certain criteria, including biological, chemical and radiological risks. As a result, much has been done to strengthen core public health capacities and preparedness for emergency response at points of entry and exit, contributing to community and global health security. for communicable disease response at airports, including drills, exercises and response coordination between the aviation and public health sectors. Furthermore, to facilitate the sharing of information and expertise, public health officials supported the WHO Ports, Airports and Ground Crossings Network (PAGNet). This network provides a forum to address international travel health and transport issues in real time. PAGNet members and WHO regional staff meet periodically for training and information sharing. Topics of discussion include preparedness at air, sea and land points of entry and exit, and coordination of response between governmental entities. Another noteworthy effort is the Global Health Security Initiative. The participants in this group, which include the health ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, as well as the European Commission and WHO officials, work to strengthen global preparedness for pandemics and bioterrorism.",

This will continue to be the case in the foreseeable future given the volume and speed of travel, the just-in-time global shipping of goods and the limited availability of local commercial supplies. Early detection, rapid public health response, and all-hazards coordination for biological, zoonotic, chemical and radiological incidents at our borders are more important now than ever. We must therefore continue to learn from and expand upon the gains we have made in the past decade by advancing the evaluation of border public health activities, publishing border intervention data and sharing lessons learnt on all-hazards public health emergency preparedness and response.",

The public health community ably responded at international borders by issuing travel advisories and health information for travellers and implementing health declarations, contact tracing or screening in some cases. 3 Within the United States of America, border planning efforts also improved readiness and coordination for other unanticipated public health emergencies. Examples include the border public health response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the subsequent cholera outbreak, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident caused by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, the repatriation of citizens during these disasters and the communication of health risk to travellers following the global resurgence of measles in 2011.",

Progress can be undermined if health authorities fail to connect the dots between border health and traditional public health activities. Border planning, training and exercise activities, along with timely cross-fertilization of ideas and information sharing can protect the health of the travelling public. This in turn can mitigate the burden of disease in the travellers' destination communities during global outbreaks.",
