Nine out of the 19 patients were detected 2019-nCoV infection using oropharyngeal swab samples, and the virus nucleic acid was also detected in eight of these nine patients using stool samples. None of positive results was identified in the blood and urine samples. Thses three different kits got the same result for each sample and the positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for 2019-nCoV was only 47.4% in the suspect patients. Therefore, it is possible that the really infected patients have been missed by using nucleic acid detection only. It might be better to make a diagnosis combining the Computed Tomography scans and the nucleic acid detection together. # These authors contributed equally to this work. *Correspondence should be addressed to: Zhenglin Yang, Yi Shi or Xingxiang Yang, Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,32 The First Ring Road West 2, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610072, China.

Although coronaviruses are broadly distributed in humans and animals, knowledge of non-segmented positive sense RNA viruses is limited (Cui et al., 2019; Woo et al., 2012).At the end of 2019, the China country office of the World Health Organization(WHO) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, China, and the causative pathogen was identified one week later as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). China's National Health Commission provided guidance to laboratories and WHO has named this disease COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020). A total of 19 suspected cases were collected at Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital (ten patients) and Sichuan Mianyang 404 Hospital (nine patients). All study procedures conformed with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was accepted by the Institutional Review Board and the Ethics Committee of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital. Each participant participated in the study voluntarily and provided signed informed consent. We collected four kinds of sample:oropharyngeal swabs, blood, urine, and stool sample-from the 19 cases for nucleic acid detection. We reviewed all patients' medical histories, clinical charts, nursing records, physical findings, and computed tomography (CT) scans, and the hematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigation results were recorded and analyzed.",

Oropharyngeal swab specimens were obtained and sent for detection of viral respiratory pathogens by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). All of the 19 cases were reported as negative for all other known pathogens tested, including influenza A and B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and four common coronavirus strains known to cause illness in humans (HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43). Stool samples from the two diarrhea cases were tested for common diarrheal pathogens to rule out other causes (To et al., 2019). Viral nucleic acid was extracted from the specimens following a common workflow and stored at -80\u00b0C.Two highly conserved sequence regions (ORF1b and N) in rotavirus were selected for primers and probes design. Three different 2019-NCoV Fluorescent RT-PCR Kits with different manufacturers but almost the same detection efficiency was used for real-time-PCR assay, including GeneoDx (GZ-TRM2, China), Maccura (Sichuan, China) and Liferiver (W-RR-0479-02, China).",

In the nine confirmed patients, eight stool samples showed positive results for 2019-nCoV; interestingly, the virus could still be detected in stool samples from patients without diarrhea symptoms. However, the other ten cases showed negative results for 2019-nCoV in stool samples, and all of the 19 cases showed negative results for 2019-nCoV in both blood and urine samples. To avoid false results, we used three different kits to test samples and got the same result for each sample.Although no nucleic acid positives were detected in serum, we cannot say that the virus will not enter the blood; it might be at a low concentration. None of the patients assessed in this study were diagnosed with viremia, but it has previously been reported that viruses have been detected in the sera of patients with viremia who wereinfected with other coronaviruses (Wang et al., 2020). The number of positive oropharyngeal swab samples was very close to the number of positive stool samples, and eight stool samples tested positive in nine patients who were confirmed using the oropharyngeal swab NAAT. This may indicate that feces may be capable of transmitting infection (further study is needed to determine whether the whole virus is found in feces or just pieces of nucleic acid) even if the patient does not have diarrhea. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f In this study, we compared the positive ratio of 2019-nCoV NAAT from different samples, and the positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for 2019-nCoV was only 47.4%. Therefore, precise diagnosis of COVID-19 seemed very difficult by relying on nucleic acid detection alone. It might be better to reach a diagnosis by combining CT scans and NAAT results, and this may be very important for the prevention and control of COVID-19.
