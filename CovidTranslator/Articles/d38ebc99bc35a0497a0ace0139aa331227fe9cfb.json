            "text": "Healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) is the most frequent complication of hospitalization affecting 4e8% of paediatric admissions in high-income settings. 1e5 In most African countries, paediatric HCAI burden, spectrum, and impact is unknown and the influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is unquantified. 6, 7 South Africa similarly lacks data on HCAI prevalence and impact, despite a comparatively better-resourced health sector with access to microbiology laboratories and infection prevention personnel at many hospitals. 8 South African data on 'whole house' surveillance for paediatric HCAI was last published almost three decades ago. A single-centre study (at the country's largest hospital) reported HCAI rates of 14.3% and 22.4 HCAI events per 100 admissions with gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections predominating. 9 A small study in a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) determined HCAI prevalence rates of 43%; both studies identified Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae as the predominant nosocomial pathogens. 9, 10 In 2005, a one-day HCAI point prevalence study at six hospitals established a prevalence of 9.7% for four HCAI types: bloodstream (BSI), urinary tract (UTI), respiratory tract (RTI) and surgical site (SSI) infections (N \u00bc 2652 adult and paediatric patients). Highest HCAI prevalence was recorded for patients admitted to ICU and paediatric wards (28.6% and 16.5%, respectively). The spectrum of HCAI types varied markedly by discipline and age, with paediatric patients experiencing higher rates of BSI and RTI. 11, 12 Studies of paediatric inpatients in other low/middle-income countries (LMIC) since 2000 also document substantial HCAI prevalence and incidence densities: 22.6% and 29 per 1000 patient-days in Indonesia, 15.4% and 9.2 per 1000 patient-days in Brazil, 15 per 1000 patient-days in Mexico and 21% in Uganda. 13e16 Risk factors for paediatric HCAI identified in these settings include malnutrition, prolonged hospital stay, use of indwelling devices, PICU admission, non-surgical disease, RTI on admission, blood transfusion, and young age. 9,10,13e17 HCAI infection density is even higher in the paediatric ICU setting, with greater contribution of device-associated HCAI including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central lineassociated BSI (CLABSI), and catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI). In 2012, the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) reported VAP, CLABSI, and CAUTI rates from 16 LMIC PICUs of 6, 8.1, and 4.1 infections per 1000 device-days, respectively, vs rates reported from US PICUs of 0.7, 1.0, and 3.5, respectively. 18, 19 Although the INICC device-associated HCAI rates far exceed rates in high-income settings, the true burden is probably even higher as 75% of INICC PICUs were located in private hospitals.",

Patients could have one or more hospitalization episode and one or more HCAI events during each hospitalization.

Several measures of HCAI occurrence were calculated: (1) HCAI patient prevalence (patient hospitalizations with at least one HCAI event/total hospitalization episodes); (2) HCAI event prevalence (total HCAI events/total hospitalization episodes); (3) HCAI incidence density (HCAI events/1000 patient-days); (4) device-associated HCAI (VAP, CLABSI, CAUTI) rates (total of each event type/total number of specific device-days \u00c21000); (5) device use ratios (total device-days/total patient-days); (6) average device-days per b Indwelling device included nasogastric tube, urinary catheter, intravenous catheter, and/or endotracheal tube.

HCAIs were infections present on admission in a child with a history of hospitalization in the preceding 30 days. Pathogens from specimens obtained <48 h after admission (without recent hospitalization) were classified as community-acquired; those isolated on hospital transfer (>48 h at the referral hospital) or >48 h post-admission were considered healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired pathogens. Laboratory isolates (bacterial, fungal, and/or viral) were considered causative pathogens if identified at the time of HCAI investigation and compatible with the clinical diagnosis, e.g. MRSA from wound swab in a patient with SSI. Bacterial isolates were categorized using the CDC list of pathogens and contaminants; repeated isolation of the same pathogen from the same site within 14 days was considered a single HCAI event. 24 Fluconazole-resistant Candida species, MRSA, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (resistant to at least three classes of antimicrobials), and extended spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae were classified as antimicrobial-resistant pathogens using proposed standard definitions. 25 A 'presumed' sepsis event was a clinically diagnosed HCAI episode occurring >48 h after hospitalization, treated empirically with broadspectrum antimicrobials for at least five calendar days, and lacking an identified focus of infection/laboratory confirmation of a pathogen. The McCabe score was used to stratify risk of death from underlying comorbid conditions: 'non-fatal' being expected survival of at least five years, 'ultimately fatal' being expected survival of between one and five years; and 'rapidly fatal' being expected death within one year. 26 Surgical procedures were categorized using the CDC/NHSN criteria as: wound class (clean/clean contaminated vs contaminated/dirty); ASA score (1e2 vs 3e5); emergency vs elective procedure and operation duration <60 vs >60 min. 22, 27 Cost analysis Cost analysis of HCAI impact was performed from the healthcare provider perspective using 2015 costs entered into the following formula (for each of the five major HCAI subtypes): number of HCAI events \u00c2 median excess length of stay for that HCAI type \u00c2 unit cost per patient day (including all laboratory investigation, radiology, and pharmacy costs).",

Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to test variables for association with HCAI events and death from HCAI (all risk factor variables with univariate association of P < 0.1 were included in the model). To account for patients with multiple admission episodes, adjustment of variance for clustering within individuals was used. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To estimate excess hospitalization for different HCAI types, affected patients were compared with three randomly selected age-and ward-matched 'controls' per HCAI event (who had been hospitalized for at least as long as the index patient). A confounder and time-matching approach was used, after excluding patient admission episodes with outcome of death or transfer, for HCAI events with a minimum of 20 events. 28 Of the study cohort, 763 (57%) were male, median age was 12.1 months (IQR: 3e47), 372 (28%) were severely malnourished, and 125 (9%) were HIV-infected [86/125 (69%)] on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

The demographic profile of patients (N \u00bc 329) who underwent recent or current surgery differed markedly from non-surgical admissions. Patients were older (mean age 25 vs 11 months; P < 0.001), less likely to be HIVinfected [8/329 (3%) vs 117/1018 (12%); P < 0.001] and less likely to have underlying comorbidities (97/329 (29%) vs 387/ 1018 (38%); P \u00bc 0.005). Of the 327 current surgeries, 67 (20%) were emergency procedures, 25 (8%) had American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score >2, 54 (17%) were classified as contaminated/dirty, and 107 (33%) procedures lasted >60 min. No potential risk factors for SSI were significant on univariate analysis: wound class (P \u00bc 0.71); ASA score (P \u00bc 0.19); emergency vs elective procedure (P \u00bc 0.78), and operation duration (P \u00bc 0.35). Notably patients in surgical disciplines had fewer HCAI events overall [70/366 (19%) vs 255/981 (26%); P \u00bc 0.009] and no fatal outcomes. Table IV describes the management and impact of the 417 HCAI events. Some patients experienced severe morbidity requiring ICU admission with/without respiratory support, inotropes, and additional surgical procedures as a direct consequence of the HCAI event. Ninety-five percent of HCAI events prompted a new antimicrobial prescription (2365 additional days of therapy) (Table V) at a cost of US$14,370. HCAIaffected hospitalization episodes produced significantly more laboratory investigation requests (mean of 16 vs 5 tests per admission; P < 0.001), totalling an additional 3575 laboratory investigations (Table VI) . After excluding outcomes of death or transfer (Table VII) , 1058 hospitalizations remained (five HCAI types with !20 events). When compared to age-and wardmatched 'controls' (three per HCAI event), HAP, LCBSI, and 'presumed' HA sepsis events significantly prolonged median (IQR) hospital stay: HAP [11 (7e24) vs 9 (6e20) days; P \u00bc 0.03]; LCBSI [20 (11e32) vs 11 (7e23) days; P \u00bc 0.02] and 'presumed' Of hospitalizations complicated by HCAI, 24/325 (7.4%) resulted in death vs 12/1022 (1.2%) HCAI-unaffected episodes (P < 0.001). Deaths associated with HCAI occurred at a median of 4 days (IQR: 2e6.8) from onset of infection. Crude mortality by HCAI event type was highest for LCBSI (9/41; 22%), followed by VAP (2/13; 15%), HAP (10/185; 5%), and 'presumed' HA sepsis (3/63; 5%). Proportionally, HAP contributed the most HCAI-associated deaths (42%) followed by LCBSI (38%), 'presumed' HA sepsis (13%), and VAP (7%). Of 10 children whose death was HAP-associated, five isolated one or more respiratory pathogens including: adenovirus (five); respiratory syncytial virus (three), influenza (one), bocavirus (one), and five had no pathogen identified. Gram-negatives and fungal pathogens predominated from fatal LCBSI events including: K. pneumoniae (three); Enterobacter cloacae (one); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one); A. baumannii (one), C. albicans (two), C. parapsilosis (one) and Enterococcus faecalis (one). By contrast, only one out of 12 children who died during HCAIunaffected hospitalizations had a pathogen isolated (Streptococcus pneumoniae). Risk factors for HCAI-associated death with P < 0.1 on univariate analysis were entered into a multivariate model including: age category, ward type, discipline, blood transfusion, isolation room stay, and McCabe score. Discipline and McCabe score were subsequently removed from the model owing to collinearity; factors independently associated with death from HCAI were PICU admission (OR: 7.6; IQR: 3.3e17.6; P < 0.001), blood transfusion (8.1; 3.9e16.6; P < 0.001) and stay in an isolation room (7.6; 2.9e19.6; P < 0.001).",

We documented overall HCAI prevalence (24.1%) higher than previously reported in hospitalized South African children on general wards (14.3%), PICUs (43%), and a point prevalence study that included paediatric wards (16.5%). 9e11 Although similar to other LMICs, our HCAI prevalence was three-to sixfold greater than rates in high income settings. 1e5,13e16 However, three out of four publications from these LMICs subsequently reported major reductions in HCAI prevalence (to 8.6%, 7.4%, and 5%) after implementing infection prevention programmes. 13, 15, 29 HCAI rates and incidence density on the PICUs were fourfold higher than in wards, reflecting the increased likelihood of infection in critically ill patients with greater use of indwelling devices and higher antimicrobial usage. Although device-associated HCAI contributed only 7% of all HCAI events, PICU patients with indwelling central lines, catheters, and endotracheal tubes were at very high risk of infection. VAP, CAUTI and CLABSI rates at our institution far exceeded those from 16 LMIC PICU, despite having lower (for central lines) or comparable (for ventilation and urinary catheters) device use ratios. However, mean device-days per patient and device dwell times in our setting exceeded those of the INICC PICUs (except for average central-line-days which were 0.9 in our PICUs vs 2.4 in INICC PICUs). 18 Our population's HCAI spectrum approximated that published from other paediatric settings with predominance of HAP, BSI, and UTI. By contrast, our cohort experienced relatively few SSI events despite a high rate of surgical interventions; this finding may partly be explained by demographic and risk factor differences in our surgical vs medical admissions. We also documented very few HA gastroenteritis events, possibly owing to the study period (May to October are low prevalence months for rotaviral disease in South Africa). Conversely, HAP events may have been over-represented in this cohort as the study months included our region's winter season with peak hospitalizations for community-acquired respiratory tract infections. 30 Risk factors for HCAI in our cohort included some factors reported from other LMIC, including malnutrition, presence of indwelling devices, underlying comorbidities, McCabe score (fatal disease), and PICU admission. HIV infection and HIV exposure are novel risk factors for paediatric HCAI in this cohort (although we have previously documented HIV as an independent predictor of antimicrobial-resistant HABSI and death from HABSI in hospitalized children). 20 Although malnutrition, underlying comorbidities, PICU admission, and HIV disease/exposure are not modifiable risk factors, they are useful to identify children at highest risk of HCAI. Similarly, the significant univariate association of HCAI with total parenteral nutrition and independent association with blood transfusion and indwelling devices provide motivation to retrain staff on intravascular device insertion/maintenance and to encourage timely removal of such devices.",

The true HCAI frequency may have been underestimated owing to a lack of prospective follow-up for HCAI events post discharge (only readmissions were included), lack of laboratory investigation of all HCAI events (specimens were sent at the attending clinician's discretion) and the low sensitivity of some laboratory investigations to detect HCAI, e.g. blood cultures, especially when antibiotic administration precedes specimen collection. The standard 48 h cut-off for separating community-acquired infections from HCAI may have resulted in some misclassification of pathogens. The calculation of excess healthcare costs arising from HCAI was not comprehensive and did not include costs related to patient isolation, additional staffing, consumables for transmissionbased precautions, additional surgical/medical procedures and opportunity costs to children/parents from extended hospital stay.
