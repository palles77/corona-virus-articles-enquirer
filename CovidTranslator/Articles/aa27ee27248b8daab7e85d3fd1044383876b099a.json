It is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. We identified factors associated with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection among suspected cases presented with sign and symptoms of upper respiratory infection or exposure to the virus. We also looked at the impact of medication history on virus transmission. Method: We included subjects with suspected MERS-CoV infection and confirmed cases of MERS infection. Subjects were excluded if there were any missing data that prevent the final analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to report demographic data. Percentages and frequencies were used to summarize the categorical variables, while means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables. Logistic regression was used to assess the risk of MERS-CoV infection among the suspected cases. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 16,189 suspected cases were identified, complete data were analyzed for 3154 to assess factors that are independently associated with MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection was associated with age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.06; 95% CI [1.02-1.098], P-value = 0.004), male gender (AOR = 1.617; 95% CI [1.365-1.77], P-value < 0.001) and diabetes (AOR = 1.68; 95% CI [1.346-1.848], P-value = 0.002. There was no significant association with the other comorbidities. Medication history was not associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection. Conclusions: MERS-Cov infection is more common in male, advanced age and diabetes. No medications were associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection. This is important to focus on screening and detection to this patient population.",

It is associated with a 35% mortality rate, primarily due to multiorgan failure (Rivers et al., 2016; Zumla et al., 2015) . Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can be transmitted either from non-human to human where dromedary camels are a major reservoir host for this virus or by a human to the human transmission which requires close contact (Cotten et al., 2013; de Groot et al., 2013) Many studies suggested that MERS-CoV has a male predominance prevalence with a median age of 40 years at illness onset (Aleanizy et al., 2017; Chan et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017) . Data showed that underlying immunodeficiency or immunosuppressant medications and therapies or diabetes mellitus are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality (Aleanizy et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017 summary, 2018) . This has directed the development of stringent screening criteria that has been implemented in different health care systems in Saudi Arabia; including Ministry of Health hospitals. A suspected case which defined as an instance of admission to a health care facility with any clinical symptoms that suggest infection or a history of contact with established cases, will trigger a laboratory MERS-CoV testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for MERS-CoV in swab samples collected at admission (Aleanizy et al., 2017) .",

As reported on smaller studies, age, male sex and comorbidities are likely to be associated with the infection (Aleanizy et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Guery et al., 2013) . Other variables are less likely to suggest MERS infection. In term of medication history, of the analyzed sample we found no statical differences that suggest increase or decrease the likelihood of the MERS infection, however, all subjects on received DiPeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors tested negative which may suggest an underlying mechanism that prevents the transmission of the virus. Other medications include metformin, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) nor beta blockers are associated with an increase or decrease in the likelihood of the MESRA infection. Like other studies that suggested that MERS infection is predominance in male, we found a statistical association that confirmed this (Aleanizy et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Guery et al., 2013) . Although, our study has a large female representation in our sample and which can be due to the likelihood of the sharp increase in health care workers-which likely to be female, screening upon exposure to a patient with a possible history of MERS infection. The other reason is many health care institutions became very strict with screening and testing any suspected cases to prevent MERS infection outbreaks which increase the female detection. Our study suggests that gender difference is associated with an increase in the likelihood of MERS infection. Also, our study suggests diabetic patient are more likely to have a confirmed MERS infection compared to nondiabetic patients which have been also reported previously in the literature (Zumla et al., 2015) .",

Although many diabetic patients were on metformin, our analysis shows that it has no effect on MERS infection. Similarly, sulfonylureas were not associated with an increase or decrease in the likelihood of the infection. Of the diabetic medication, patient on DDP-4 inhibitors was less likely to have MERS infection. The entry receptor for MERS-CoV was identified as a dipeptidyl peptidase receptor.

Moreover, the severity of the infection and the increased risk of mortality is likely with older patients and patients with diabetes and chronic kidney diseases. These findings suggest the benefit of screening suspected infection and may suggest future preventive therapy.",
